Our results suggest that DSB formation is a physiological event that rapidly resolves topological constraints to early-response gene expression in neurons. Neurons are endowed with the remarkable ability to sense and process changes in an organism’s external environment. The exposure to a new sensory experience, for instance, profoundly alters the morphology and connectivity of neural circuits, and these changes are thought to be instrumental in the formation of long-lasting memories and adaptive responses (Goelet et al., 1986Goelet P. Castellucci V.F. Schacher S. Kandel E.R. The long and the short of long-term memory—a molecular framework.Nature. 1986; 322: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways that underlie these experience-dependent changes have been studied extensively and have led to the current orthodoxy that the initiation of new gene transcription programs is crucial for synaptic plasticity. Neuronal activity-regulated genes are classified into different subgroups based on the latency of their expression following an activity-dependent stimulus. Genes induced in the earliest wave, referred to as early-response genes, are enriched for transcription factors, such as Fos, Npas4, Egr1, and Nr4a1, and their expression occurs independently of de novo protein synthesis (West and Greenberg, 2011West A.E. Greenberg M.E. Neuronal activity-regulated gene transcription in synapse development and cognitive function.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: 3Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These transcription factors then govern the expression of late-response genes, such as Bdnf, Homer1, Nrn1, and Rgs2, which are induced with relatively slower kinetics. In this way, early-response genes ultimately regulate various synaptogenic processes, including neurite outgrowth, synapse development and maturation, and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses (West and Greenberg, 2011West A.E. Greenberg M.E. Neuronal activity-regulated gene transcription in synapse development and cognitive function.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: 3Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The defining characteristic of early-response genes is their rapid and robust expression within minutes after stimulation. A number of molecular features that facilitate this rapid response have been described previously. For instance, even in the absence of an activity-dependent stimulus, the Fos promoter is already bound by the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex and by activity-dependent transcription factors, such as CREB and SRF. Furthermore, nucleosomes at the Fos promoter already carry chromatin modifications that are permissive for active transcription, including histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) (Kim et al., 2010Kim T.-K. Hemberg M. Gray J.M. Costa A.M. Bear D.M. Wu J. Harmin D.A. Laptewicz M. Barbara-Haley K. Kuersten S. et al.Widespread transcription at neuronal activity-regulated enhancers.Nature. 2010; 465: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). Neuronal activity then variously causes the phosphorylation of CREB and the SRF cofactor, ELK1, the recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase, CBP, to the Fos promoter, and CBP and RNAPII recruitment to enhancer elements of activity-regulated genes (West and Greenberg, 2011West A.E. Greenberg M.E. Neuronal activity-regulated gene transcription in synapse development and cognitive function.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: 3Crossref Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Together, these changes orchestrate the expression of neuronal activity-regulated genes. Despite these details however, the precise nature of the molecular switch that precludes early-response gene expression under basal conditions, as well as the mechanisms that override this impediment in response to neuronal activity still remain poorly understood. Our findings suggest that the expression of early-response genes is subdued by the imposition of topological constraints and that the rapid resolution of these constraints in response to neuronal activity involves the generation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) within their promoters. Our results stemmed from some unexpected observations made while studying the effects of DSB formation in neurons. The accrual of DNA damage has been linked to various neurological disorders, and we previously described the formation of DNA lesions, particularly DNA DSBs, to be an apical neurotoxic event in several mouse models of neurodegeneration (Dobbin et al., 2013Dobbin M.M.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). With the idea of further characterizing the consequences of DSB formation in neurons, we incubated cultured primary neurons with etoposide for 6 hr and performed gene expression profiling using next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Etoposide is an established inhibitor of topoisomerase II (Topo II) that traps the enzyme in a complex with the cleaved DNA and thereby converts a normal physiological reaction into a potentially toxic DSB. Transcriptomic analysis after etoposide treatment revealed 692 genes that were differentially expressed compared to vehicle-treated controls. Consistent with the expectation that DSBs would interfere with transcription, an overwhelming majority (680 genes) of the differentially expressed genes were downregulated (Figure 1A and Table S1). Remarkably, however, the 12 genes that were upregulated were enriched for neuronal activity-regulated genes and particularly the so-called early-response genes, such as Fos, FosB, and Npas4—transcription factors that are also rapidly expressed in response to neuronal activity (Figures 1B and 1C). Based on these observations, we directly assessed the expression of various neuronal activity-regulated genes after etoposide treatment of cultured primary neurons using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Early-response genes, including Fos, FosB, Npas4, and Egr1 were all upregulated within 20 min of treatment with etoposide (Figure 1D). However, other activity-regulated genes, such as Bdnf and Homer1, showed no such increase in either the RNA-seq or the qRT-PCR experiments (Figures 1C and 1D). Thus, etoposide selectively induces a small subset of activity-regulated genes. We then evaluated whether etoposide-mediated early-response gene expression is a result of the activation of the DNA damage response. Cultured primary neurons pre-incubated with a specific inhibitor (KU55933; ATMi) against ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) caused a marked reduction in DSB signaling, as indicated by a reduction in the intensity of γH2AX, a marker of DSB signaling (Figure 1E). However, ATM inhibition had no effect on the etoposide-mediated increase in Fos and Npas4 expression (Figure 1E). In addition to this, we tested whether treatment of neurons with other DSB-inducing agents also induced the expression of early-response genes. These agents included the radiomimetic drugs, neocarzinostatin (ncs) and bleomycin (bleo), and the PARP inhibitor, Olaparib (PARPi). Interestingly, none of these drugs recapitulated the effects of etoposide on Fos and Npas4 expression (Figure 1F). Together, our results unexpectedly revealed that Topo II-mediated DSBs stimulate the expression of early-response genes. Because early-response genes are normally induced in response to stimulation of neuronal activity, we tested whether established paradigms of neuronal stimulation are also associated with DSB production. Brief incubations of cultured primary neurons with potassium chloride (KCl), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), or bicucullin (bic), all caused a substantial increase in Fos and Npas4 mRNA (Figures S1A and S1B). Interestingly, each of these treatments also caused an increase in the levels of γH2AX, an established marker of DNA DSBs (Figure S1C) (Crowe et al., 2006Crowe S.L. Movsesyan V.A. Jorgensen T.J. Kondratyev A. Rapid phosphorylation of histone H2A.X following ionotropic glutamate receptor activation.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 23: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition to this, mouse acute hippocampal slices that were either bath-incubated in NMDA solution or subject to theta-burst electrical stimulation also showed increased γH2AX levels compared to untreated controls (Figures S1D and S1E). To understand whether DSBs are also formed following neuronal activity in vivo, we subjected wild-type C57BL/6 mice to a training paradigm for contextual fear conditioning, following which we prepared hippocampal lysates and measured γH2AX levels. Similar to our observations with cultured primary neurons and hippocampal slices, elevated γH2AX levels were detectable in hippocampal lysates within 15 min after exposure to the fear-conditioning paradigm (Figure S1F). Moreover, DSB formation has also been reported in other neuronal stimulation paradigms (Suberbielle et al., 2013Suberbielle E. Sanchez P.E. Kravitz A.V. Wang X. Ho K. Eilertson K. Devidze N. Kreitzer A.C. Mucke L. Physiologic brain activity causes DNA double-strand breaks in neurons, with exacerbation by amyloid-β.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Thus, neuronal activity correlates with the formation of DNA DSBs in neurons. To further understand the relationship between neuronal activity and DSB formation, we next determined the positions of activity-dependent DSBs on a genome-wide level. DSB formation results in the rapid phosphorylation of the histone variant, H2AX, at Ser139 in the vicinity of DSB sites (Rogakou et al., 1998Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. DNA double-stranded breaks induce histone H2AX phosphorylation on serine 139.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar). The identification of chromatin enriched for γH2AX can be exploited to derive the locations of DSBs (Iacovoni et al., 2010Iacovoni J.S. Caron P. Lassadi I. Nicolas E. Massip L. Trouche D. Legube G. High-resolution profiling of gammaH2AX around DNA double strand breaks in the mammalian genome.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1446-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, Rodriguez et al., 2012Rodriguez R.

Small-molecule-induced DNA damage identifies alternative DNA structures in human genes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). We therefore stimulated cultured primary neurons by briefly incubating them with 50 μM NMDA and then performed genome-wide γH2AX ChIP-seq. For an initial assessment of genome-wide γH2AX ChIP-seq signals, we classified genomic regions into 14 distinct chromatin states associated with regulatory regions (promoters, enhancers, heterochromatin, etc.) based on available ChIP-seq data of chromatin marks, including H3K36me3, H4K20me1, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 (Figure S2A) (Ernst et al., 2011Ernst J.

Correlating the positional information of these chromatin marks with raw γH2AX ChIP-seq signals revealed that the observed increase in γH2AX is confined largely to actively transcribed genes and their downstream regions, but not to enhancers, polycomb repressed regions, or heterochromatin (Figure 2A).Figure 2Neuronal Activity-Induced DNA DSBs Form at Early-Response GenesShow full caption(A) Genomic regions were categorized into 14 distinct chromatin states based on combinatorial patterns of various chromatin marks (Figure S2A).

To further characterize the distribution of enriched γH2AX signals within genomic regions, we performed differential peak calling (Experimental Procedures) and observed that γH2AX enrichment following NMDA treatment occurs primarily within gene bodies compared to distal intergenic regions (Figure 2B). Surprisingly, our analysis revealed only 21 regions that were enriched for γH2AX signals in the NMDA-treated samples compared to controls. Twenty of these regions were within genes, whereas one site was detected in intergenic regions (Figure 2C). Remarkably, included within these 21 loci were the early-response genes, Fos, FosB, Npas4, Egr1, Nr4a1, and Nr4a3 (Figure 2C). In addition to the transcription factors categorized as early-response genes, several other transcription factors, Olig2 and Dlx6os1, as well as several non-coding RNAs, including Malat1, AI854517, and C130071C03Rik were also represented among the loci that showed elevated γH2AX (Figure 2C). Additionally, the loci identified by differential peak calling also displayed the highest γH2AX intensities in the NMDA-treated samples, but not in vehicle-treated samples (Tables S2 and S3). A closer examination of γH2AX distribution at these loci, including at the early-response genes, revealed a peculiar pattern, with γH2AX peaks initiating adjacent to the transcriptional start site (TSS), spreading into the gene body, and terminating downstream of the 3′UTR (Figure 2D and Figure S2B). In fact, γH2AX peak width was strictly proportional to gene length (Figure S2C). The only exception to this scenario was the case of Homer1, in which γH2AX signals only spanned across the annotated short isoform of Homer1 (Figure S2B). While the significance of this is presently unclear, it is noteworthy that only the short isoform of Homer1 is regulated by neuronal activity (Sala et al., 2003Sala C. Futai K. Yamamoto K. Worley P.F. Hayashi Y. Sheng M. Inhibition of dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic transmission by activity-inducible protein Homer1a.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6327-6337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these early-response genes, none of the other late response genes, including Bdnf, Rgs2, Nrn1, and Gpr3 showed an increase in γH2AX intensity in their vicinity following NMDA treatment (Figure 2D and Figure S2B). Together these results indicate that activity-dependent stimulation of neurons results in the formation of DNA DSBs at very specific locations in the genome, particularly near early-response genes. In an effort to determine the mechanisms that underlie the formation of neuronal activity-induced DSBs, we returned to our original observation that etoposide treatment is specifically able to upregulate the expression of early-response genes (Figure 1F). Etoposide introduces DSBs by targeting Topo II (Vos et al., 2011Vos S.M. Tretter E.M. Schmidt B.H. Berger J.M. All tangled up: how cells direct, manage and exploit topoisomerase function.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 827-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells express two distinct isoforms of Topo II, Topo IIα, and Topo IIβ. Topo IIα is mainly expressed in dividing cells, whereas Topo IIβ is robustly expressed in postmitotic cells, including neurons, and is primarily implicated in transcription-related functions (Austin and Marsh, 1998Austin C.A. Marsh K.L. Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II beta.BioEssays. 1998; 20: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Incidentally, Topo IIβ-mediated DSBs were previously shown to be essential for estradiol-stimulated activation of gene expression (Ju et al., 2006Ju B.G. Lunyak V.V. Perissi V. Garcia-Bassets I. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. A topoisomerase IIbeta-mediated dsDNA break required for regulated transcription.Science. 2006; 312: 1798-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). These observations caused us to focus specifically on Topo IIβ. We began by assessing Topo IIβ binding at various regions of the prototypical early-response gene, Fos, under basal conditions. Topo IIβ ChIP-qPCR indicated negligible binding in the exons of the Fos gene, as well as within the promoters of β-globin and GAPDH (Figure 3A). However, Topo IIβ binding was significantly enriched within the Fos promoter (Figure 3A). Similarly, Topo IIβ binding was also enriched within the Npas4 promoter (Figure 3A). These results suggest that Topo IIβ is bound to the promoters of early-response genes under basal conditions. The regulatory elements that bind the Fos promoter are well characterized, and additional ChIP experiments revealed that Topo IIβ co-occupies the Fos promoter together with ELK1, as well as the lysine deacetylase, HDAC2 (Figure 3B and Figure S3A). We previously showed that HDAC2 binds to the promoters of several early-response genes and negatively modulates their expression (Guan et al., 2009Guan J.-S. Haggarty S.J. Giacometti E. Dannenberg J.-H. Joseph N. Gao J. Nieland T.J.F. Zhou Y. Wang X. Mazitschek R. et al.HDAC2 negatively regulates memory formation and synaptic plasticity.Nature. 2009; 459: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). While screening for proteins that could potentially regulate HDAC2 binding to these promoters, we separately discovered that the protein, tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2), binds HDAC2 and is enriched at several early-response gene promoters, including Fos and Npas4, under basal conditions (Figure S3B and data not shown). These results are intriguing because Topo II-mediated DSBs involve the formation of a covalent phosphotyrosyl bond between Topo II and the DNA, and TDP2 specializes in processing these intermediates and in the repair of Topo II-mediated DSBs (Cortes Ledesma et al., 2009Cortes Ledesma F. El Khamisy S.F. Zuma M.C. Osborn K. Caldecott K.W. A human 5′-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase that repairs topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage.Nature. 2009; 461: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To test whether Topo IIβ activity could underlie activity-induced DSB formation, we first measured levels of Topo IIβ cleavage complexes following NMDA treatment using an immune complex of enzyme (ICE) assay (Nitiss et al., 2012Nitiss J.L. Soans E. Rogojina A. Seth A. Mishina M. Topoisomerase assays.Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol Chapter. 2012; 3 (Unit 3.3)Google Scholar). As a control, we incubated neurons with etoposide and observed an increase in Topo IIβ covalent complexes (Figure S3C). Interestingly, NMDA treatment also caused an increase in Topo IIβ covalent complexes, indicating that neuronal activity results in Topo IIβ-mediated DNA cleavage (Figure S3C). To further assess how neuronal activity affects Topo IIβ, we immunoprecipitated Topo IIβ following NMDA treatment of primary neurons and incubated the precipitated Topo IIβ with supercoiled plasmids. Incubation with Topo IIβ caused a potent relaxation of supercoiled plasmids in both NMDA-treated and vehicle-treated samples (Figure 3C). However, plasmids incubated with Topo IIβ from NMDA-treated samples also displayed increased smearing, indicative of fragmented DNA (Figure 3C). These results suggest neuronal activity confers Topo IIβ with an increased propensity to generate DNA breaks. We next performed DNA cleavage assays in which we incubated purified, recombinant Topo IIβ together with supercoiled plasmids that either contained or lacked the upstream sequences of the Fos gene. As expected, incubation of supercoiled plasmids with Topo IIβ caused an increase in relaxed (Form II) DNA (Figure 3D). In the presence of etoposide, an increase in linear (Form III) DNA was also detected in plasmids containing Fos upstream sequences. However, the generation of this linear DNA was sharply attenuated when Fos upstream sequences were deleted (Figure 3D). Similar results were also observed with plasmids containing Npas4 upstream sequences. Together, these results suggest that Topo IIβ preferentially cleaves the promoters of early-response genes. Based on Topo IIβ binding in the promoters of early-response genes, we then speculated that if Topo IIβ generates DSBs in these promoters in an activity-dependent manner, that such cleavage should prevent the amplification of these regions using the primers that detect Topo IIβ enrichment (Figure 3E). Control Topo IIβ ChIP experiments following etoposide treatment of cultured primary neurons revealed a significant reduction in amplification by two distinct primer sets that span the Fos promoter (Figure 3F). Importantly, Topo IIβ ChIP following NMDA treatment also indicated a sharp reduction in the amplification of the Fos promoter regions (Figures 3F and S3D). A similar attenuation in PCR amplification was also observed following ELK1 ChIP in NMDA-treated neurons (Figure 3G). To determine whether activity-induced DNA cleavage occurs at a specific site within the Fos promoter, we repeated the PCR amplification assays after Topo IIβ ChIP using various primer combinations that spanned the originally identified Topo IIβ binding region within the Fos promoter. However, each region that showed enriched amplification following Topo IIβ ChIP under basal conditions also showed reduced amplification following NMDA treatment (Figure S3E). Thus, activity-induced DSBs are not site-specific but rather occur broadly within the Fos promoter. Taken together, our results indicate that neuronal activity-induced DSBs occur within the promoters of early-response genes and that these DSBs could result from the activities of Topo IIβ. To further examine the connections between Topo IIβ and activity-induced DSBs, we performed Topo IIβ ChIP-seq under basal conditions and following neuronal activity. An analysis of Topo IIβ signals within various genomic regions suggested that under basal conditions, Topo IIβ binding is enriched primarily at and upstream of the TSS of actively transcribed genes, as well as at enhancer elements, but not at heterochromatin or polycomb repressed regions (Figure 4A and Table S4). A comparison with existing datasets of various factors that bind activity-regulated genes (Kim et al., 2010Kim T.-K. Hemberg M. Gray J.M. Costa A.M. Bear D.M. Wu J. Harmin D.A. Laptewicz M. Barbara-Haley K. Kuersten S. et al.Widespread transcription at neuronal activity-regulated enhancers.Nature. 2010; 465: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar) revealed that Topo IIβ binding is enriched at SRF and CREB binding sites, as well as CBP binding sites within promoters and enhancers (Figures 4B and 4C). These results further indicate that Topo IIβ binding patterns overlap with regulators of neuronal activity-induced gene expression. Interestingly, NMDA caused a substantial increase in genome-wide Topo IIβ binding. Whereas 430 Topo IIβ peaks were identified under basal conditions, 2,416 peaks were detected within 20 min of the initial NMDA treatment (Table S4). This nearly 5-fold increase in Topo IIβ signals was largely proportionally distributed within the same chromatin regions that showed Topo IIβ binding under basal conditions (Figure 4A and Table S4). NMDA treatment also caused"
https://openalex.org/W1957266799,"The standard model of particle physics describes the fundamental particles and their interactions via the strong, electromagnetic and weak forces. It provides precise predictions for measurable quantities that can be tested experimentally. The probabilities, or branching fractions, of the strange B meson () and the B0 meson decaying into two oppositely charged muons (μ+ and μ−) are especially interesting because of their sensitivity to theories that extend the standard model. The standard model predicts that the and decays are very rare, with about four of the former occurring for every billion mesons produced, and one of the latter occurring for every ten billion B0 mesons1. A difference in the observed branching fractions with respect to the predictions of the standard model would provide a direction in which the standard model should be extended. Before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN2 started operating, no evidence for either decay mode had been found. Upper limits on the branching fractions were an order of magnitude above the standard model predictions. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) collaborations have performed a joint analysis of the data from proton–proton collisions that they collected in 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy of seven teraelectronvolts and in 2012 at eight teraelectronvolts. Here we report the first observation of the µ+µ− decay, with a statistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the best measurement so far of its branching fraction. Furthermore, we obtained evidence for the µ+µ− decay with a statistical significance of three standard deviations. Both measurements are statistically compatible with standard model predictions and allow stringent constraints to be placed on theories beyond the standard model. The LHC experiments will resume taking data in 2015, recording proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 teraelectronvolts, which will approximately double the production rates of and B0 mesons and lead to further improvements in the precision of these crucial tests of the standard model."
https://openalex.org/W1607969426,"Proteins begin to fold as they emerge from translating ribosomes. The kinetics of ribosome transit along a given mRNA can influence nascent chain folding, but the extent to which individual codon translation rates impact proteome integrity remains unknown. Here, we show that slower decoding of discrete codons elicits widespread protein aggregation in vivo. Using ribosome profiling, we find that loss of anticodon wobble uridine (U34) modifications in a subset of tRNAs leads to ribosome pausing at their cognate codons in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans. Cells lacking U34 modifications exhibit gene expression hallmarks of proteotoxic stress, accumulate aggregates of endogenous proteins, and are severely compromised in clearing stress-induced protein aggregates. Overexpression of hypomodified tRNAs alleviates ribosome pausing, concomitantly restoring protein homeostasis. Our findings demonstrate that modified U34 is an evolutionarily conserved accelerator of decoding and reveal an unanticipated role for tRNA modifications in maintaining proteome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1538429890,"We determined how learning modifies neural representations in primary visual cortex (V1) during acquisition of a visually guided behavioral task. We imaged the activity of the same layer 2/3 neuronal populations as mice learned to discriminate two visual patterns while running through a virtual corridor, where one pattern was rewarded. Improvements in behavioral performance were closely associated with increasingly distinguishable population-level representations of task-relevant stimuli, as a result of stabilization of existing and recruitment of new neurons selective for these stimuli. These effects correlated with the appearance of multiple task-dependent signals during learning: those that increased neuronal selectivity across the population when expert animals engaged in the task, and those reflecting anticipation or behavioral choices specifically in neuronal subsets preferring the rewarded stimulus. Therefore, learning engages diverse mechanisms that modify sensory and non-sensory representations in V1 to adjust its processing to task requirements and the behavioral relevance of visual stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W1544607115,"Hippocampal theta rhythm arises from a combination of recently described intrinsic theta oscillators and inputs from multiple brain areas. Interneurons expressing the markers parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) are leading candidates to participate in intrinsic rhythm generation and principal cell (PC) coordination in distal CA1 and subiculum. We tested their involvement by optogenetically activating and silencing PV or SOM interneurons in an intact hippocampus preparation that preserves intrinsic connections and oscillates spontaneously at theta frequencies. Despite evidence suggesting that SOM interneurons are crucial for theta, optogenetic manipulation of these interneurons modestly influenced theta rhythm. However, SOM interneurons were able to strongly modulate temporoammonic inputs. In contrast, activation of PV interneurons powerfully controlled PC network and rhythm generation optimally at 8 Hz, while continuously silencing them disrupted theta. Our results thus demonstrate a pivotal role of PV but not SOM interneurons for PC synchronization and the emergence of intrinsic hippocampal theta."

We combined data from 5,745 cases and 10,675 controls with other published datasets containing genome-wide CNV data. In this much-enlarged sample of 11,355 cases and 16,416 controls, we show for the first time that case CNVs are enriched for genes involved in GABAergic neurotransmission. Consistent with non-genetic reports of GABAergic deficits in schizophrenia, our findings now show disrupted GABAergic signaling is of direct causal relevance, rather than a secondary effect or due to confounding. Additionally, we independently replicate and greatly extend previous findings of CNV enrichment among genes involved in glutamatergic signaling. Given the strong functional links between the major inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic systems, our findings converge on a broad, coherent set of pathogenic processes, providing firm foundations for studies aimed at dissecting disease mechanisms."

The fuzzy-DEMATEL model was then employed to assess the direction and level of interaction between environmental performance criteria. The core environmental performance criteria which were critical for enhancing environmental performance of the PCB industry in Taiwan were identified and presented.

https://openalex.org/W1579924187,"Mouse sperm produce enough ATP to sustain motility by anaerobic glycolysis and respiration. However, previous studies indicated that an active glycolytic pathway is required to achieve normal sperm function and identified glycolysis as the main source of ATP to fuel the motility of mouse sperm. All the available evidence has been gathered from the studies performed using the laboratory mouse. However, comparative studies of closely related mouse species have revealed a wide range of variation in sperm motility and ATP production and that the laboratory mouse has comparatively low values in these traits. In this study, we compared the relative reliance on the usage of glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation as ATP sources for sperm motility between mouse species that exhibit significantly different sperm performance parameters. We found that the sperm of species with higher oxygen consumption/lactate excretion rate ratios were able to produce higher amounts of ATP, achieving higher swimming velocities. Additionally, we show that the species with higher respiration/glycolysis ratios have a higher degree of dependence upon active oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, we characterize for the first time two mouse species in which sperm depend on functional oxidative phosphorylation to achieve normal performance. Finally, we discuss that sexual selection could promote adaptations in sperm energetic metabolism tending to increase the usage of a more efficient pathway for the generation of ATP (and faster sperm)."
https://openalex.org/W1501304874,"Place cell firing relies on information about self-motion and the external environment, which may be conveyed by grid and border cells, respectively. Here, we investigate the possible contributions of these cell types to place cell firing, taking advantage of a developmental time window during which stable border cell, but not grid cell, inputs are available. We find that before weaning, the place cell representation of space is denser, more stable, and more accurate close to environmental boundaries. Boundary-responsive neurons such as border cells may, therefore, contribute to stable and accurate place fields in pre-weanling rats. By contrast, place cells become equally stable and accurate throughout the environment after weaning and in adulthood. This developmental switch in place cell accuracy coincides with the emergence of the grid cell network in the entorhinal cortex, raising the possibility that grid cells contribute to stable place fields when an organism is far from environmental boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W1584279891,"Motor behaviors recruit task-specific neuronal ensembles in motor cortices, which are consolidated over subsequent learning. However, little is known about the molecules that can identify the participating neurons and predict the outcomes of the consolidation process. Using a mouse rotarod-learning task, we showed that lesion or inactivation of the secondary motor (M2) cortex disrupts learning of skilled movements. We tracked the endogenous promoter activity of the neuronal activity-regulated gene Arc in individual M2 neurons during rotarod learning by in vivo two-photon imaging of a knockin reporter. We found that task training initially recruits Arc-promoter-activated neurons and then consolidates them into a specific ensemble exhibiting persistent reactivation of Arc-promoter. The intensity of a neuron's initial Arc-promoter activation predicts its reactivation probability and neurons with weak initial Arc-promoter activation are dismissed from the ensemble during subsequent training. Our findings demonstrate a task-specific Arc-dependent cellular consolidation process in M2 cortex during motor learning."

Network modeling and animal experiments suggest that these genetic differences in GR-induced transcriptional activation may mediate the risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders by altering a network of functionally related stress-sensitive genes in blood and brain. Major depressive disorder (MDD) has a lifetime prevalence of up to 17% (Kessler et al., 2005Kessler R.C. Berglund P. Demler O. Jin R. Merikangas K.R. Walters E.E. Lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of DSM-IV disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2005; 62: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (12944) Google Scholar), resulting in one of the highest global burden of disease ratings by the World Health Organization (Ustün et al., 2004Ustün T.B. Ayuso-Mateos J.L. Chatterji S. Mathers C. Murray C.J.L. Global burden of depressive disorders in the year 2000.Br. J. Psychiatry. 2004; 184: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). Despite its prevalence and impact, the etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MDD are poorly understood, resulting in sub-optimal treatments with high rates of recurrence and treatment resistance (Warden et al., 2007Warden D. Rush A.J. Trivedi M.H. Fava M. Wisniewski S.R. The STAR∗D Project results: a comprehensive review of findings.Curr. Psychiatry Rep. 2007; 9: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Family, twin, and population studies point to both genetic as well as environmental risk factors for depression. Genetic factors contribute up to 40% of the risk and are complemented largely by individual-specific environmental exposure to adverse life events (Kendler et al., 2006Kendler K.S. Gatz M. Gardner C.O. Pedersen N.L. A Swedish national twin study of lifetime major depression.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2006; 163: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Both sensitivity and resilience to the long-term effects of exposure to adverse life events may be modulated by genetic variation (Kendler, 2013Kendler K.S. What psychiatric genetics has taught us about the nature of psychiatric illness and what is left to learn.Mol. Psychiatry. 2013; 18: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Stress results in activation of the stress hormone system, which culminates in the activation of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) by cortisol. The GR is a nuclear hormone receptor, and upon activation it translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) and regulates gene expression (McKay and Cidlowski, 1999McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Molecular control of immune/inflammatory responses: interactions between nuclear factor-kappa B and steroid receptor-signaling pathways.Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459PubMed Google Scholar, Phuc Le et al., 2005Phuc Le P. Friedman J.R. Schug J. Brestelli J.E. Parker J.B. Bochkis I.M. Kaestner K.H. Glucocorticoid receptor-dependent gene regulatory networks.PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: e16Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Activation of this receptor not only initiates adaptive physiological changes in the body to confront an imminent threat, but also facilitates the termination of these changes once the threat has been overcome. Thus, genetically driven variability in GR regulation of the stress hormone response may functionally interact with environmental risk factors, thereby producing individual differences in risk for MDD. Consistent with this model, dysfunction of GR-mediated negative feedback has been reported in MDD (de Kloet et al., 2005de Kloet E.R. Joëls M. Holsboer F. Stress and the brain: from adaptation to disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3315) Google Scholar) as well as in individuals exposed to early adversity (Heim and Binder, 2012Heim C. Binder E.B.

Psychopathol. 2011; 23: 1017-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), one of the strongest risk factors for the development of MDD. Moreover, genetic variation in pathways regulating GR signaling has been linked with MDD risk (van Rossum et al., 2006van Rossum E.F. Binder E.B. Majer M. Koper J.W. Ising M. Modell S. Salyakina D. Lamberts S.W. Holsboer F. Polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor gene and major depression.Biol. Psychiatry. 2006; 59: 681-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Here, we show that common genetic variants that modulate the initial transcriptional response to GR activation increase the risk for MDD as well as other psychiatric disorders. Gene network modeling and animal experiments suggest that these genetic differences in the transcriptional response to GR activation may mediate risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders by altering a network of co-expressed genes that are responsive to stress and glucocorticoids in the brain. In addition, these genetic variants shape the response of the amygdala, which is itself an important trigger of the stress hormone response and a functional neural phenotype implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of depression and other forms of psychopathology (Jankord and Herman, 2008Jankord R.

The main hypotheses and the experimental approach are summarized in Figure 1. We first identified genetic variants that alter GR-stimulated gene expression changes by adopting a stimulated expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) approach (Figure 2A). Gene expression profiles in peripheral blood cells from 160 male individuals of the Max-Planck Institute of Psychiatry (MPIP) cohort (91 cases and 69 controls, see Experimental Procedures) were obtained at baseline and 3 hr after stimulation with the selective GR agonist dexamethasone (Figure S1A) and combined with genome-wide SNP data. All individuals showed a strong endocrine response to dexamethasone (Cortisol: F1,159 = 43.93, p = 5.02 × 10−10 and ACTH: F1,158 = 37.96, p = 5.76 × 10−9; Figures S1B and S1C). After quality control, 4,447 gene expression probes that exhibited strong regulation following dexamethasone administration (absolute fold change in gene expression from baseline to 3 hr post-dexamethasone ≥ 1.3 in at least 20% of all samples) were combined with genotype data of ∼2 million imputed SNPs (see Experimental Procedures). Using the log fold change in gene expression standardized to baseline values as the outcome and restricting the analysis to a ± 1 Mb cis-region around each probe, we found that 3,820 GR-response-modulating cis-eQTLs (GR-response eQTLs) remained significant after accounting for disease status, age, and BMI and correction for multiple testing (see Experimental Procedures). These comprised 297 unique array probes and 3,662 unique SNPs. The 3,662 unique GR-response cis-expression SNPs (eSNPs) can be summarized in terms of independent tag SNPs into 296 uncorrelated GR-response cis-eSNP bins, i.e., sets of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD; see Experimental Procedures). We defined the tag eSNP as the eSNP showing the highest association per bin (lowest Q value). These 296 GR-response cis-eSNP bins correspond to 320 GR-response cis-eQTL bins, i.e., cis-eSNP bin-probe combinations, as one cis-eSNP bin can be associated with the regulation of more than one transcript and vice versa. These GR-response cis-eQTL bins are listed in Table S1 and illustrated in Figures 2B–2D. Including dexamethasone serum levels or the blood cell count as covariate did not change the results, excluding any confounding effects of individual differences in dexamethasone concentration and cellular composition (see Supplemental Information). To assess the robustness of these GR-response eQTLs, we validated them in an independent sample of n = 58 (see Experimental Procedures) by performing a sample size-weighted Z score meta-analysis across both samples. In this analysis, 72% of the GR-response eQTLs could be validated, i.e., showed a meta-analysis p value equal to or more significant than in the discovery sample alone (see Experimental Procedures). This method accounts for the small size of the validation sample and suggests the robustness of most of the GR-response eQTLs. To better understand the properties of these GR-response eQTLs, we first mapped the GR-eSNPs (n = 3,662 SNPs) to GR binding regions as defined by ChIP-seq peaks in lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) GM12878 (see Experimental Procedures). We observed a significant enrichment of GR-response eSNPs in GR binding sites as compared to random SNPs (fold enrichment = 2.4, permutation-based FDR ≤ 0.001). Next, we mapped the distance of the 320 GR-response eQTL bins to the genomic location of the probe sequence of the respective regulated transcript (utilizing the closest SNP within a bin) and compared this to the probe distance for baseline cis-eQTL bins, i.e., the eSNP-probe combinations that showed a significant association of the genotype with transcription levels at baseline (see Supplemental Information). The GR-response eSNP bin-to-probe distance (mean = 406 kb, standard deviation [SD] = 303 kb, n = 320 bins) was significantly longer (Wilcoxon p value = 1.03 × 10−50) than baseline eSNP bin-to-probe distance (mean = 149 kb, SD = 232 kb, n = 1,148 bins; Supplemental Information). This suggests that GR stimulation is associated with significantly more long-range transcriptional regulation than baseline gene expression and that distinct regulatory elements may be involved in baseline versus GR-stimulated gene transcription. To determine the regulatory potential of GR-response eSNPs, we investigated whether they are enriched within enhancer regions as defined by the Roadmap Epigenome Project (Kundaje et al., 2015Kundaje A. Meuleman W. Ernst J. Bilenky M. Yen A. Heravi-Moussavi A. Kheradpour P. Zhang Z. Wang J. Ziller M.J. et al.Roadmap Epigenomics ConsortiumIntegrative analysis of 111 reference human epigenomes.Nature. 2015; 518: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (3578) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures). GR-response tag eSNPs were significantly enriched within enhancers in 62 different tissues, including blood cells, but also non-hematopoietic tissue such as brain (see Figure S2). When testing baseline tag eSNPs, we only observed an enrichment in enhancers in 54% of these 62 tissues. Whether combined enrichment of both GR-response tag eSNPs and baseline tag eSNPs was observed seemed to be tissue specific (see Figure S2). In fact, GR-response eSNPs were more enriched in brain enhancers than baseline eSNPs, i.e., only one of the eight brain enhancers significantly enriched with GR-response eSNPs also displayed a significant enrichment for baseline eSNPs (see Figure 3). In contrast, we observed equal enrichment for GR-response as well as baseline eSNPs in primary hematopoietic tissues (see Figure S2). These results further support the viewpoint that GR-response eSNPs affect different transcriptional regulators than baseline eSNPs and suggest possible cross-tissue effects of these SNPs. To evaluate whether the long-range regulation of GR-response eQTLs may be associated with long-range physical chromatin interaction, we compared our data with that from a chromatin interaction analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) generated by ENCODE (ENCODE Project Consortium, 2011ENCODE Project ConsortiumA user’s guide to the encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE).PLoS Biol. 2011; 9: e1001046Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar) in the leukemia cell line K562. For this, we examined whether regions containing the GR-response eSNP bin and the corresponding probe gene overlap with physically interacting ChIA-PET tags (see Experimental Procedures). Twenty-five percent of the GR-response eSNP bin-probe gene combinations overlapped with chromatin interaction signals. This was significantly greater than 1,000 equally sized sets of randomly distributed GR-response eSNP bin, especially when restricting the analysis to more long-range eSNP bin-probe gene pairs with distances > 100 kb (fold enrichment>100kb = 1.57, permutation-based FDR>100kb = 0.007; see Experimental Procedures). To validate these long-range chromatin interactions, we used a chromatin conformation capture (3C) assay to confirm a physical interaction between the eSNP bin regions of the GR-response eSNP tag rs1379868 in the NRTN locus and the corresponding GR-stimulated transcript LONP1 (see Figures 4A and 4B ), which is over 130 kb upstream. This eSNP bin includes a GR binding site and ChIA-PET tags (see Figure 4C), which interact with the transcription start site of the LONP1 gene. The 3C assay confirmed an increased chromatin interaction (p = 3.35 × 10−23, χ2 = 115.15 at baseline) of the eSNP bin with the TSS of the LONP1 gene (P4 in Figures 4C and 4D) in five LCLs. The average interaction frequency of these two sites was higher following stimulation with the GR-agonist dexamethasone (4.83 versus 5.65). These results suggest that long-range regulation of GR-response eQTLs could be mediated by direct chromatin interaction of enhancer regions with the respective transcription start sites. Besides their functional characterization, an important question was to assess whether the genetic variants that alter the immediate transcriptional response to GR activation (GR-response eSNPs) would also be associated with risk for stress-related psychiatric disorder. To assess this, we first tested whether our GR-response eSNPs were overrepresented among SNPs associated with MDD in the genome-wide association study (GWAS) results of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), which includes approximately 9,000 cases and the same number of controls (Ripke et al., 2013Ripke S. Wray N.R. Lewis C.M. Hamilton S.P. Weissman M.M. Breen G. Byrne E.M. Blackwood D.H. Boomsma D.I. Cichon S. et al.Major Depressive Disorder Working Group of the Psychiatric GWAS ConsortiumA mega-analysis of genome-wide association studies for major depressive disorder.Mol. Psychiatry. 2013; 18: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Among nominally associated loci with MDD (at meta-analysis p value ≤ 0.05), 282 SNPs also represent a GR-response eSNP. Permutation analysis (see Experimental Procedures) predicted an expected mean overlap of 210 SNPs from 1,000 randomly selected SNP sets (fold enrichment = 1.34, permutation-based FDR < 0.001; Figure 5A). We next investigated whether GR-response eSNPs were also enriched over baseline eSNPs, as SNPs associated with transcriptional changes have been shown to be more enriched in GWASs in general (Roussos et al., 2014Roussos P. Mitchell A.C. Voloudakis G. Fullard J.F. Pothula V.M. Tsang J. Stahl E.A. Georgakopoulos A. Ruderfer D.M. Charney A. et al.A role for noncoding variation in schizophrenia.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 1417-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Again the mean overlap for 1,000 permuted baseline cis-eSNP sets (218 SNPs) was significantly lower than the actual overlap of GR-response eSNPs (fold enrichment = 1.29, permutation-based FDR < 0.001; Figure 5A). These enrichments remain significant when using only the tag eSNPs (n = 285) to control for possible confounding due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure (fold enrichment = 1.31, permutation-based FDR = 0.082). The 282 GR-response eSNPs that overlap with MDD-associated SNPs correspond to 23 unique eSNP bins (reflecting 26 eQTL bins) that regulate 25 unique transcripts (Table S2). We call these 23 eSNP bins “MDD-related GR eSNP bins” in the remainder of the manuscript to refer to GR-response eSNPs that also show a nominal association with MDD. We next examined whether these MDD-related GR eSNPs would also be associated with MDD in an independent sample. For this we constructed a genetic risk profile score (GRPS) using the tagging SNPs of the 23 MDD-related GR eSNP bins for each individual in an independent validation sample of 1,005 MDD cases and 478 controls (Table S3; see also Experimental Procedures). We found these GRPSs to be significantly associated with MDD and that individuals with higher GRPSs were overrepresented in the case group (Z = 3.76, p = 0.00017; Figure 5B). This GRPS explains about 2.6% of the total variance for MDD in this sample, and the association of these MDD-related GR eSNP GRPSs was more significant than GRPSs constructed from 1,000 randomly generated SNP profiles (permutation-based FDR = 0.008; see Experimental Procedures). As exposure to stressful life events is a strong risk factor not only for MDD but also for other psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) (Dohrenwend and Egri, 1981Dohrenwend B.P. Egri G. Recent stressful life events and episodes of schizophrenia.Schizophr. Bull. 1981; 7: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Kendler and Karkowski-Shuman, 1997Kendler K.S. Karkowski-Shuman L. Stressful life events and genetic liability to major depression: genetic control of exposure to the environment?.Psychol. Med. 1997; 27: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), we tested whether the GR-response eSNPs were also overrepresented among SNPs associated with other psychiatric disorders utilizing meta-analysis data from the PGC. Using this approach, we tested for for significant GR-response eSNP enrichment compared to 1,000 randomly generated baseline eSNP sets in the PGC for four additional psychiatric disorders and the cross-disorders analysis including also MDD (see Table 1). In the latest multi-stage SCZ GWAS, which includes up to 36,989 cases and 113,075 controls (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumBiological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci.Nature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5067) Google Scholar), we detected a significant enrichment of GR-response eSNPs compared to baseline eSNPs with SNPs associated with SCZ at p ≤ 0.05 (fold enrichment 1.29, permutation-based FDR ≤ 0.001). When we limited the enrichment analysis to genome-wide significant SCZ loci, we detected 134 GR-response eSNPs that overlapped SNPs associated with SCZ at p ≤ 5 × 10−8. This corresponds to a 10-fold enrichment over baseline eSNPs and is 7.75-fold higher than for nominally associated SCZ SNPs (see Table 1). A significant negative enrichment was identified for loci associated with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (permutation-based FDR ≤ 0.012; ADHD; 840 cases and 1,947 trio cases) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD; permutation-based FDR ≤ 0.001; 161 cases and 4,788 trio cases) but not BPD (see Table 1).Table 1Proportion of GR-Response eSNPs Overlapping with GWAS SNPs with Nominal SignificanceGR-Response eSNPsRandom SNPsFold enrichmentBaseline eSNPsFold enrichmentCountMean countaProportion of the number of GR-response eSNPs observed for 1,000 permuted random SNPs and baseline eSNPs.RangeFDRMean countaProportion of the number of GR-response eSNPs observed for 1,000 permuted random SNPs and baseline eSNPs.RangeFDRCDA11586.5 ± 8.99 SD61–1190.0011.33102.03 ± 8.57 SD71–1300.0661.13BPD9170.36 ± 8.34 SD44–1000.0091.2986.18 ± 8.2 SD59–1150.2951.05SCZ15784.08 ± 8.79 SD61–111<0.0011.87129.07 ± 9.61 SD99–1580.0271.22SCZ2948533.29 ± 21.59 SD469–615<0.0011.78736.55 ± 22.32 SD676–813< 0.0011.29SCZ2 (5 × 10−8)bOverlap at genome-wide significance level.1346.43 ± 2.52 SD0–18<0.00120.9413.37 ± 3.32 SD4–24< 0.00110.02ADHD2955.69 ± 7.14 SD36-79<0.001cNegative enrichment and inverse fold enrichment.−1.8942.23 ± 5.78 SD25–630.012cNegative enrichment and inverse fold enrichment.−1.44ASD3463.73 ± 7.62 SD44–91<0.001cNegative enrichment and inverse fold enrichment.−1.85114.94 9.09 SD80–147< 0.001cNegative enrichment and inverse fold enrichment.−3.35MDD282210 ± 13.9 SD168–255<0.0011.34218.11 ± 13.49 SD174–268< 0.0011.29CD14983.16 ± 8.89 SD61–112<0.0011.8150.5 ± 10.27 SD121–1820.591−1.006RA39671.9 ± 8.06 SD46–100<0.0015.56372.37 ± 16.08 SD323–4300.0781.06Height350146.01 ± 11.9 SD108–188<0.0012.4340.84 ± 14.91 SD294–3900.2681.03Schizophrenia, SCZ; bipolar disorder, BPD; attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, ADHD; Crohn’s disease, CD; autism spectrum disorder, ASD; major depressive disorder, MDD; cross-disorder associations, CDA; rheumatoid arthritis, RA.a Proportion of the number of GR-response eSNPs observed for 1,000 permuted random SNPs and baseline eSNPs.b Overlap at genome-wide significance level.c Negative enrichment and inverse fold enrichment. Open table in a new tab Schizophrenia, SCZ; bipolar disorder, BPD; attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, ADHD; Crohn’s disease, CD; autism spectrum disorder, ASD; major depressive disorder, MDD; cross-disorder associations, CDA; rheumatoid arthritis, RA. To test whether these enrichments of GR-response eSNPs as compared to baseline eSNPs are specific to psychiatric disorders, we mapped these variants to GWAS for rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and height but found no enrichment more than 1.06-fold (see Table 1). These analyses suggest that GR-response eSNPs are unrelated to these medical disorders or general quantitative traits but specifically contribute to the risk for MDD and SCZ. Next, we investigated whether the probe genes (n = 24), regulated by the MDD-related GR eSNPs, are part of specific pathways that may be relevant for the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Using the GeneMANIA tool (Montojo et al., 2014Montojo J. Zuberi K. Rodriguez H. Bader G.D. Morris Q. GeneMANIA: Fast gene network construction and function prediction for Cytoscape.F1000Res. 2014; 3: 153Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we were able to generate a gene network containing 23 of the 24 MDD-related GR genes (see Figure 6A and Experimental Procedures). Within this network, the type of interactions between the MDD-related GR genes that were most enriched were: co-expression (1.21 times the number expected when using other GR-stimulated transcript sets), co-localization (genes are expressed in the same tissue or proteins are found in the same location; fold enrichment = 1.21), and shared protein domains (fold enrichment = 3.77). Several genes, e.g., FTH1, CCT7, RPS2, IMPDH2, and PELI1, presented more than ten interactions. Additional co-expression analysis identified that the MDD-related GR genes are more tightly co-regulated in blood than in 1,000 sets of randomly chosen transcripts selected from all GR-responsive transcripts (fold enrichment = 1.04, permutation-based FDR = 0.078). These data provide support that the MDD-related GR genes functionally interact to perform an orchestrated function, i.e., they are coordinated in their transcriptional response to GR activation or stress. A limited network analysis through manually curated interactions from the scientific literature (Lechner et al., 2012Lechner M. Höhn V. Brauner B. Dunger I. Fobo G. Frishman G. Montrone C. Kastenmüller G. Waegele B. Ruepp A. CIDeR: multifactorial interaction networks in human diseases.Genome Biol. 2012; 13: R62Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) revealed that these genes show associations with MDD, SCZ, BPD, neurodevelopmental disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and response to antidepressant treatment in independent datasets (see Figure S3). In addition, they seem predominantly involved in pathways associated with ubiquitination and proteasome degradation and the inflammatory response, systems that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD and SCZ, as well as in stress-related changes in synaptic plasticity (Miller et al., 2009Miller A.H.

To establish whether the transcripts regulated by acute GR activation in blood are also regulated in the brain within a similar time frame, we investigated whether the orthologs of the 24 MDD-related GR transcripts were differentially regulated in mouse blood and brain (prefrontal cortex [PFC], hippocampus [HC], and amygdala [AM]) 4 hr following dexamethasone administration (10 mg/kg dexamethasone i.p.). In this experiment, 17 of the 24 genes had a mouse orthologous gene, and 16 were expressed above microarray detection threshold. One-third of the genes showed significant changes at FDR ≤ 0.1 and 53.3% at p ≤ 0.05 in one or more of the investigated brain regions. Over 86% of the genes were significantly regulated (FDR ≤ 0.1) in mouse blood (see Figure 6B left panel). In order to extend these results from pharmacologic GR agonism, we further evaluated whether acute social defeat stress, which is commonly used to induce depressive-like behavior, differentially regulates these same 24 MDD-related genes in mice. In this experiment, 17 orthologous genes were analyzed in blood, PFC, AM, and HC samples 4 hr after exposure to an aggressive resident mouse with short attack latency (Wagner et al., 2013Wagner K.V. Hartmann J. Mangold K. Wang X.-D. Labermaier C. Liebl C. Wolf M. Gassen N.C. Holsboer F. Rein T. et al.Homer1 mediates acute stress-induced cognitive deficits in the dorsal hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 3857-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here, three (MKNK2, SLCO3A1, and OCIAD2) of the five genes that were significantly differently regulated after dexamethasone stimulation were also significantly regulated following social defeat (FDR ≤ 0.1) in in one or more of the analyzed brain regions (see Figure"
https://openalex.org/W1583008282,"Neuronal signals related to visual attention are found in widespread brain regions, and these signals are generally assumed to participate in a common mechanism of attention. However, the behavioral effects of attention in detection can be separated into two distinct components: spatially selective shifts in either the criterion or sensitivity of the subject. Here we show that a paradigm used by many single-neuron studies of attention conflates behavioral changes in the subject's criterion and sensitivity. Then, using a task designed to dissociate these two components, we found that multiple aspects of attention-related neuronal modulations in area V4 of monkey visual cortex corresponded to behavioral shifts in sensitivity, but not criterion. This result suggests that separate components of attention are associated with signals in different brain regions and that attention is not a unitary process in the brain, but instead consists of distinct neurobiological mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1604110764,"Motor cortex, basal ganglia (BG), and thalamus are arranged in a recurrent loop whose activity guides motor actions. In the dominant model of the function of the BG and their role in Parkinson’s disease, direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) striatal projection neurons are proposed to oppositely modulate cortical activity via BG outputs to thalamus. Here, we test this model by determining how striatal activity modulates primary motor cortex in awake head-restrained mice. We find that, within 200 ms, dSPN and iSPN activation exert robust and opposite effects on the majority of cortical neurons. However, these effects are heterogeneous, with certain cortical neurons biphasically modulated by iSPN stimulation. Moreover, these striatal effects are diminished when the animal performs a motor action. Thus, the effects of dSPN and iSPN activity on cortex are at times antagonistic, consistent with classic models, whereas in other contexts these effects can be occluded or coactive."

To address this issue, we used chronic calcium imaging in behaving adult mice to examine the activity of individual excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the same region of the layer 2/3 monocular visual cortex following enucleation. We found that only a fraction of excitatory neurons homeostatically recover activity after deprivation and inhibitory neurons show no recovery. Prior to deprivation, excitatory cells that did recover were more likely to have significantly correlated activity with other recovering excitatory neurons, thus forming a subnetwork of recovering neurons. These network level changes are accompanied by a reduction in synaptic inhibition onto all excitatory neurons, suggesting that both synaptic mechanisms and subnetwork activity are important for homeostatic recovery of activity after deprivation. Homeostatic regulation has been shown to restore cortical activity in vivo following sensory deprivation, but it is unclear whether this recovery is uniform across all cells or specific to a subset of the network.

These network level changes are accompanied by a reduction in synaptic inhibition onto all excitatory neurons, suggesting that both synaptic mechanisms and subnetwork activity are important for homeostatic recovery of activity after deprivation. Homeostatic plasticity is thought to be essential for maintaining the firing rate of neurons and preventing aberrantly low or high network activity (Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Homeostatic plasticity in the developing nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Homeostatic restoration of cortical activity following sensory deprivation has been demonstrated in vivo in the visual cortex in excitatory cells in both the developing (Hengen et al., 2013Hengen K.B.

Multiple homeostatic mechanisms that may underlie activity restoration following sensory deprivation have been described, including synaptic scaling, alterations to the balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I balance), and changes to neuronal excitability (Turrigiano, 2011Turrigiano G. Too many cooks? Intrinsic and synaptic homeostatic mechanisms in cortical circuit refinement.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Ex vivo experiments performed during development have shown that different sensory deprivation paradigms invoke different homeostatic mechanisms in neuronal circuits of cortical layer 2/3 (L2/3) (Maffei and Turrigiano, 2008Maffei A. Turrigiano G.G. Multiple modes of network homeostasis in visual cortical layer 2/3.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these mechanisms are expressed in a layer specific manner at different stages of development (Desai et al., 2002Desai N.S. Cudmore R.H. Nelson S.B. Turrigiano G.G.

In the adult cortex, excitatory plasticity is often preceded by a reduction in synaptic inhibition onto excitatory cells (Chen et al., 2011Chen J.L. Lin W.C. Cha J.W. So P.T. Kubota Y. Nedivi E.

Atallah B.V. Scanziani M. Equalizing excitation-inhibition ratios across visual cortical neurons.Nature. 2014; 511: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The relative time course of these changes, as well as the fact that they occur following a number of different deprivation paradigms, including monocular deprivation, focal retinal lesions, and binocular retinal lesions, suggests that reduced synaptic inhibition may generally be permissive for excitatory reorganization (Chen et al., 2011Chen J.L.

Consistent with this idea, the artificial reduction of inhibition in vivo increases cortical plasticity (Chen et al., 2011Chen J.L. Lin W.C. Cha J.W. So P.T. Kubota Y. Nedivi E.

Reduced activity in the inhibitory cells themselves also plays a role in plasticity in the developing cortex (Kuhlman et al., 2013Kuhlman S.J. Olivas N.D. Tring E. Ikrar T. Xu X. Trachtenberg J.T. A disinhibitory microcircuit initiates critical-period plasticity in the visual cortex.Nature. 2013; 501: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and this reduced inhibitory cell activity recovers following sensory deprivation via monocular deprivation (Hengen et al., 2013Hengen K.B.

It remains unclear whether recovery of inhibitory cell activity occurs in adult animals, which, given that inhibitory cells are extensively connected to local excitatory cells (Fino and Yuste, 2011Fino E.

Evidence suggests that cortical networks organize into smaller subnetworks of connected neurons within the wider network of excitatory and inhibitory cells (Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013Harris K.D. Mrsic-Flogel T.D. Cortical connectivity and sensory coding.Nature. 2013; 503: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These subnetworks express a variety of different connectivity patterns ranging from very local connectivity (Kozloski et al., 2001Kozloski J. Hamzei-Sichani F. Yuste R.

Excitatory cortical neurons form fine-scale functional networks.Nature. 2005; 433: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Excitatory neurons form subnetworks of connected neurons that share a common organizing principle, such as preferences for sensory stimuli (Ko et al., 2011Ko H. Hofer S.B. Pichler B. Buchanan K.A.

Bultje R.S. Wang X. Shi S.-H. Specific synapses develop preferentially among sister excitatory neurons in the neocortex.Nature. 2009; 458: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that inhibitory neurons form connections in a more widespread and less specific manner than excitatory cells (Fino and Yuste, 2011Fino E. Yuste R. Dense inhibitory connectivity in neocortex.Neuron. 2011; 69: 1188-1203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, Hofer et al., 2011Hofer S.B. Ko H. Pichler B. Vogelstein J.

Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of inhibitory neurons in subnetworks likely differs from that of excitatory cells (Fino and Yuste, 2011Fino E. Yuste R. Dense inhibitory connectivity in neocortex.Neuron. 2011; 69: 1188-1203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, Hofer et al., 2011Hofer S.B. Ko H. Pichler B. Vogelstein J.

Fine-scale specificity of cortical networks depends on inhibitory cell type and connectivity.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1552-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the role of subnetworks during cortical plasticity following sensory deprivation is unclear. To investigate the role of subnetworks of cells in homeostatic plasticity, we first measured the responses of individual excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the same cortical region of the monocular visual cortex in adult mice following monocular enucleation. We found that individual excitatory neurons in L2/3 could be divided into two groups: (1) those that become completely inactive after deprivation and (2) those that homeostatically recover activity, i.e., those in which a period of reduced activity is followed by a gradual recovery of activity over a period of 48–72 hr. In contrast, inhibitory neurons either become completely inactive or exhibit decreased activity, but do not show recovery of activity. When we examined known homeostatic mechanisms, we found that following deprivation, synaptic inhibition was reduced onto both putative recovering and inactive L2/3 excitatory neurons. Finally, when we investigated the role of subnetworks in homeostatic recovery, we found that, prior to deprivation, recovering neurons were more likely to have had correlated activity with other recovering excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons that remain active. Similarly, prior to enucleation, cells that would become inactive after deprivation were more often correlated with other cells that would become inactive, suggesting that there are subnetworks of neurons that will either recover or become inactive. These results indicate that in L2/3 of the adult visual cortex, homeostatic recovery of activity involves both network activity and a reduction in synaptic inhibition. We used the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5 (Akerboom et al., 2012Akerboom J. Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Tian L. Marvin J.S. Mutlu S. Calderón N.C. Esposti F. Borghuis B.G. Sun X.R. et al.Optimization of a GCaMP calcium indicator for neural activity imaging.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 13819-13840Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) to chronically measure the calcium signals of individual neurons in L2/3 of the adult monocular visual cortex in behaving mice on a spherical treadmill (Figure 1A; Keck et al., 2013Keck T. Keller G.B. Jacobsen R.I. Eysel U.T. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M. Synaptic scaling and homeostatic plasticity in the mouse visual cortex in vivo.Neuron. 2013; 80: 327-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Neurons in the same region of the visual cortex were repeatedly imaged both in the 24 hr before and the 72 hr after monocular enucleation (Figure 1A), with the intent to examine homeostatic changes in individual cells. Because we hypothesized that excitatory and inhibitory cells may respond differently to sensory deprivation, we first set out to identify which of the neurons we imaged were excitatory and which were GABAergic, so that we could determine their relative roles in homeostatic plasticity. Thus, upon completion of the imaging time course, each brain was sectioned parallel to the imaging plane and immunolabelled using antibodies for both GFP, to enhance the GCaMP5 signal, and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, to identify inhibitory neurons (Figure 1B). The cortical regions imaged in vivo were reconstructed in histological sections and the previously imaged cells were identified as putative excitatory neurons or putative inhibitory neurons based on the immunohistochemistry (Figure 1B; see Kerlin et al., 2010Kerlin A.M. Andermann M.L. Berezovskii V.K. Reid R.C. Broadly tuned response properties of diverse inhibitory neuron subtypes in mouse visual cortex.Neuron. 2010; 67: 858-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar; see Supplemental Information). This allowed us to examine the calcium traces of identified cell types (Figure 1C). We measured the kinetics of calcium transients prior to deprivation and found cell type differences (Figures 1C and 1D). The kinetics of isolated calcium transients from inhibitory neurons were faster than those from excitatory neurons. They had shorter normalized decay times (Figure 1E) and a smaller total area (Figure 1F). Given these differences, we developed a classifier to separate excitatory and inhibitory cell types based on their calcium transients. We first trained this classifier on half of our data in which the excitatory and inhibitory cells were identified to determine the thresholds for separating cell types. We then cross-validated the classifier on the second half of the data, which was novel to the classifier and found it could separate cell types based on calcium transients alone with 91% accuracy (Figure S1, see Experimental Procedures). This allowed us to study the activity profiles of the same excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as their interactions, in vivo before and after monocular enucleation. Having classified neurons into excitatory and inhibitory cell types, we chronically measured the effect of monocular enucleation using calcium signals as a proxy for neuronal activity in putative excitatory cells. We first measured the average activity of all cells and found that, similar to binocular retinal lesions (Keck et al., 2013Keck T. Keller G.B. Jacobsen R.I. Eysel U.T. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M. Synaptic scaling and homeostatic plasticity in the mouse visual cortex in vivo.Neuron. 2013; 80: 327-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and monocular deprivation (Hengen et al., 2013Hengen K.B. Lambo M.E. Van Hooser S.D. Katz D.B. Turrigiano G.G. Firing rate homeostasis in visual cortex of freely behaving rodents.Neuron. 2013; 80: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), activity decreases following enucleation and recovers over 48–72 hr (Figure S2A, see Discussion). To determine if this recovery of activity occurs in all of the neurons, we analyzed the activity profiles of individual neurons. First, we examined whether all visually driven neurons that were active before enucleation undergo homeostatic recovery of activity. We measured excitatory cells that were visually responsive (i.e., were significantly more responsive during visual stimulation than in darkness, in the absence of locomotion) prior to enucleation. The activity of these cells accounted for 87% of all the activity measured in our paradigm prior to (sham) enucleation. Consistent with previous work (Peters et al., 2014Peters A.J. Chen S.X. Komiyama T. Emergence of reproducible spatiotemporal activity during motor learning.Nature. 2014; 510: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), we found that whether or not a cell was active on a given day was variable: the measured day-to-day variability of the population in control animals (i.e., the fraction of cells that become inactive/active between two 15 min recording sessions spaced by 24 hr) was 25% ± 1% for cells becoming inactive and 19% ± 4% for cells becoming active. Following deprivation, we found that we could separate excitatory cells that were active during baseline into two groups: either (1) becoming inactive after deprivation—i.e., having no activity 72 hr after enucleation—which we will refer to as “inactive” or (2) recovering their activity—i.e., are active 72 hr after deprivation—which we will refer to as “recovering” (Figure 2A). After enucleation, 48% of cells became inactive (Figure 2B) and thus do not contribute to the homeostatic recovery observed in the average activity. There was a significantly higher fraction of these inactive cells in enucleated animals relative to cells that became inactive over the same time course in control animals (Figure 2B, inset; 32% of cells). The other 52% of excitatory cells recovered their activity after enucleation and, on average, exhibited an activity profile (Figures 2C and 2D) where activity decreased rapidly (12 to 24 hr) after enucleation and then gradually recovered (Figure 2D). We next examined whether the homeostatic restoration observed is partially attributable to the recruitment of cells that were inactive prior to deprivation, as has previously been described following deprivation of L2/3 neurons in somatosensory cortex (Margolis et al., 2012Margolis D.J. Lütcke H. Schulz K. Haiss F. Weber B. Kügler S. Hasan M.T. Helmchen F. Reorganization of cortical population activity imaged throughout long-term sensory deprivation.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We found that, in our paradigm, only a small percentage of excitatory neurons that were previously inactive during both baseline time points (−24 and −1 hr) became active after 72 hr in control animals (4% ± 1%) or following enucleation (3% ± 1%; control versus enucleation, p = 0.452, t test). Furthermore, the overall activity levels of these neurons were very low, accounting for less than 5% of the total activity 72 hr after (sham) enucleation. Thus, these data indicate that only a subset of cells undergo homeostatic recovery of activity following visual deprivation and that the recovery is not driven by the recruitment of cells that were previously inactive. We then examined if homeostatic recovery could be explained by differences in the input properties of recovering or inactive cells. We specifically examined visual activity and locomotion-related drive, as cells in the visual cortex are modulated by locomotion (Andermann et al., 2011Andermann M.L. Kerlin A.M. Roumis D.K.

In activity measurements prior to enucleation, we found no difference between recovering and inactive cells in overall baseline activity (Figure S4A), orientation selectivity (Figure S2B), orientation tuning preference (percentage of cells [calculated per animal] tuned to 0 degrees: recovering 25% ± 8%, inactive 29% ± 6%, and p = 0.913; 45 degrees: recovering 31% ± 11%, inactive 19% ± 8%, and p = 0.389; 90 degrees: recovering 13% ± 11%, inactive 12% ± 8%, and p = 0.388; 135 degrees: recovering 31% ± 19%, inactive 40% ± 10%, and p = 0.848, t test), or responses to locomotion in the darkness (Figure S2C). Furthermore, responses following enucleation were not visually evoked, as their occurrence at the onset (within 500 ms) of visual stimuli was similar to chance levels (Figure S2D) and responses were equally likely to occur in light and dark conditions after enucleation (Figure S2E). These results suggest that the spared ipsilateral eye was not directly driving the recovering cells. While we found no evidence for common inputs to recovering or inactive cells, when we measured cortical activity while the mice were stationary in the dark, as a proxy for spontaneous activity, we saw that spontaneous activity was maintained and subsequently increased following enucleation in the recovering neurons, but not in the cells that became inactive (Figure S2F). Finally, we found no effects on the cellular properties of cells expressing GCaMP5 or a difference in GCaMP5 expression in recovering or inactive cells (Figures S2G–S2O). Having characterized the activity of putative excitatory neurons, we then examined the activity in putative inhibitory neurons, which has previously only been measured following sensory deprivation during development (Hengen et al., 2013Hengen K.B. Lambo M.E. Van Hooser S.D. Katz D.B. Turrigiano G.G. Firing rate homeostasis in visual cortex of freely behaving rodents.Neuron. 2013; 80: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We found a reduction in inhibitory cell activity following enucleation, with approximately 65% of inhibitory neurons becoming inactive (having no activity 72 hr after deprivation), in comparison to 38% of cells that no longer responded over the same time course in control mice (Figure 2E). Those inhibitory neurons that remained active 72 hr after deprivation exhibited a reduction in normalized activity 12 hr after enucleation (Figure 2F) and unlike the excitatory neurons, the activity of these inhibitory neurons did not show a significant recovery over time (Figure 2F). We observed no difference in cellular properties (Figures S2G, S2I, and S2P–S2U) or plasticity (Figures S2V–S2Y) in GCaMP5-positive and -negative inhibitory neurons, suggesting this lack of recovery is unrelated to the expression of our calcium indicator. To ensure that there was not an increase in inhibitory activity in the cortex via the post-enucleation addition of previously silent inhibitory neurons, we measured the number of newly activated inhibitory neurons 72 hr after enucleation that had not been active in either baseline time point (−24 and −1 hr) and found that it was low in both control mice (2% ± 1%) and following enucleation (3% ± 2%; control versus enucleation, p = 0.537, t test). Together, these results suggest that a subset of inhibitory cells remain active, but that their activity levels are decreased, implicating that there are overall lower levels of cortical inhibition. Thus, we show for the first time that inhibitory neurons in adult animals do not homeostatically recover their activity over the time course of 72 hr. Having described homeostatic recovery in a subset of excitatory, but not inhibitory, cells, we next examined if there are changes in identified homeostatic mechanisms in excitatory cells following deprivation and the time course of these changes. We first checked for changes in synaptic inhibition onto the L2/3 excitatory cells by performing whole-cell patch clamp recordings in acute slices prepared from mice that had previously undergone monocular enucleation. We measured the frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs), which approximate the number and strength, respectively, of the inhibitory synapses onto these cells. Similar to previous studies in layer 5 (L5) cells (Keck et al., 2011Keck T. Scheuss V. Jacobsen R.I. Wierenga C.J. Eysel U.T. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M.

Synaptic scaling and homeostatic plasticity in the mouse visual cortex in vivo.Neuron. 2013; 80: 327-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we found that mIPSC frequency (Figure 3A), but not amplitude (Figure 3B), was significantly and consistently decreased, suggesting that there are fewer inhibitory synapses onto these L2/3 cells. We next examined changes in evoked inhibitory potentials by measuring the balance between evoked (with the stimulating electrode in L2/3) excitatory and inhibitory potentials on L2/3 cells 24, 48, or 72 hr after deprivation (Figure 3C). We found the E/I balance to be shifted toward excitation in individual L2/3 excitatory neurons 24 hr after enucleation (Figure 3D), prior to the observed recovery of excitatory cortical activity 48 hr after deprivation. Together, these data suggest that synaptic inhibition is decreased, which may play a role in facilitating the homeostatic recovery in activity levels. We next examined if synaptic scaling occurs after monocular enucleation. Over our 72 hr time course, we found no change in either miniature excitatory post-synaptic potential (mEPSP) amplitude (Figure 3E) or frequency (Figure 3F) in acute slices prepared from mice that had previ"

Sleep-related car crashes account for a considerable proportion of accident at the wheel. Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1), narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) are rare central disorders of hypersomnolence, the most severe causes of sleepiness thus being potential dangerous conditions for both personal and public safety with increasing scientific, social, and political attention. Our main objective was to assess the frequency of recent car crashes in a large cohort of patients affected with well-defined central disorders of hypersomnolence versus subjects from the general population. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study in French reference centres for rare hypersomnia diseases and included 527 patients and 781 healthy subjects. All participants included needed to have a driving license, information available on potential accident events during the last 5 years, and on potential confounders; thus analyses were performed on 282 cases (71 IH, 82 NT2, 129 NT1) and 470 healthy subjects. Results Patients reported more frequently than healthy subjects the occurrence of recent car crashes (in the previous five years), a risk that was confirmed in both treated and untreated subjects at study inclusion (Untreated, OR = 2.21 95%CI = [1.30–3.76], Treated OR = 2.04 95%CI = [1.26–3.30]), as well as in all disease categories, and was modulated by subjective sleepiness level (Epworth scale and naps). Conversely, the risk of car accidents of patients treated for at least 5 years was not different to healthy subjects (OR = 1.23 95%CI = [0.56–2.69]). Main risk factors were analogous in patients and healthy subjects. Conclusion Patients affected with central disorders of hypersomnolence had increased risk of recent car crashes compared to subjects from the general population, a finding potentially reversed by long-term treatment."

However, the precise functional significance of this well-established orderly neuronal migration remains largely unclear. Here, we show that strong electrical synapses selectively form between RGPs and their newborn progeny and between sister excitatory neurons in ontogenetic radial clones at the embryonic stage. Interestingly, the preferential electrical coupling between sister excitatory neurons, but not that between RGP and newborn progeny, is eliminated in mice lacking REELIN or upon clonal depletion of DISABLED-1, which compromises the inside-out radial neuronal migration pattern in the developing neocortex. Moreover, increased levels of Ephrin-A ligand or receptor that laterally disperse sister excitatory neurons also disrupt preferential electrical coupling between radially aligned sister excitatory neurons. These results suggest that RGP-guided inside-out radial neuronal migration facilitates the initial assembly of lineage-dependent precise columnar microcircuits in the neocortex."

https://openalex.org/W568721195,"Ferroproteins arose early in Earth's history, prior to the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis and the subsequent reduction of bioavailable iron. Today, iron availability limits primary productivity in about 30% of the world's oceans. Diatoms, responsible for nearly half of oceanic primary production, have evolved molecular strategies for coping with variable iron concentrations. Our understanding of the evolutionary breadth of these strategies has been restricted by the limited number of species for which molecular sequence data is available. To uncover the diversity of strategies marine diatoms employ to meet cellular iron demands, we analyzed 367 newly released marine microbial eukaryotic transcriptomes, which include 47 diatom species. We focused on genes encoding proteins previously identified as having a role in iron management: iron uptake (high-affinity ferric reductase, multi-copper oxidase, and Fe(III) permease); iron storage (ferritin); iron-induced protein substitutions (flavodoxin/ferredoxin, and plastocyanin/cytochrome c6) and defense against reactive oxygen species (superoxide dismutases). Homologs encoding the high-affinity iron uptake system components were detected across the four diatom Classes suggesting an ancient origin for this pathway. Ferritin transcripts were also detected in all Classes, revealing a more widespread utilization of ferritin throughout diatoms than previously recognized. Flavodoxin and plastocyanin transcripts indicate possible alternative redox metal strategies. Predicted localization signals for ferredoxin identify multiple examples of gene transfer from the plastid to the nuclear genome. Transcripts encoding four superoxide dismutase metalloforms were detected, including a putative nickel-coordinating isozyme. Taken together, our results suggest that the majority of iron metabolism genes in diatoms appear to be vertically inherited with functional diversity achieved via possible neofunctionalization of paralogs. This refined view of iron use strategies in diatoms elucidates the history of these adaptations, and provides potential molecular markers for determining the iron nutritional status of different diatom species in environmental samples."
https://openalex.org/W1525241096,"Temporally precise neuronal firing phase-locked to gamma oscillations is thought to mediate the dynamic interaction of neuronal populations, which is essential for information processing underlying higher-order functions such as learning and memory. However, the cellular mechanisms determining phase locking remain unclear. By devising a virus-mediated approach to perform multi-tetrode recording from genetically manipulated neurons, we demonstrated that synaptic plasticity dependent on the GluR1 subunit of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptor mediates two dynamic changes in neuronal firing in the hippocampal CA1 area during novel experiences: the establishment of phase-locked firing to slow gamma oscillations and the rapid formation of the spatial firing pattern of place cells. The results suggest a series of events potentially underlying the acquisition of new spatial information: slow gamma oscillations, originating from the CA3 area, induce the two GluR1-dependent changes of CA1 neuronal firing, which in turn determine information flow in the hippocampal-entorhinal system."
https://openalex.org/W1949373242,"Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a death ligand cytokine known for its cytotoxic activity against malignantly transformed cells. TRAIL induces cell death through binding to death receptors DR4 and DR5. The inhibitory decoy receptors (DcR1 and DcR2) co-expressed with death receptor 4 (DR4)/DR5 on the same cell can block the transmission of the apoptotic signal. Here, we show that DcRs also regulate TRAIL sensitivity at a supracellular level and thus represent a mechanism by which the microenvironment can diminish tumour TRAIL sensitivity. Mathematical modelling and layered or spheroid stroma-extracellular matrix-tumour cultures were used to model the tumour microenvironment. By engineering TRAIL to escape binding by DcRs, we found that DcRs do not only act in a cell-autonomous or cis-regulatory manner, but also exert trans-cellular regulation originating from stromal cells and affect tumour cells, highlighting the potent inhibitory effect of DcRs in the tumour tissue and the necessity of selective targeting of the two death-inducing TRAIL receptors to maximise efficacy."

However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully explored. We report in this study that Shp2 is upregulated in prostate cancers and is associated with a poor disease outcome, namely tumor metastasis and shortened patient survival. Overexpression of wild-type Shp2 or an oncogenic Shp2 mutant leads to increased prostate cancer cell proliferation, colony and sphere formation, and in vivo tumor formation. Opposite effects are seen in Shp2-knockdown cells. Moreover, Shp2 promotes in vitro migration and in vivo metastasis of prostatic tumor cells. Mechanistically, Shp2 interacts with PAR3 (partitioning-defective 3) via its Src homology-2 domain. Ectopic expression of Shp2 attenuates the phosphorylation of PAR3 and the formation of the PAR3/PAR6/atypical protein kinase C polarity protein complex, resulting in disrupted cell polarity, dysregulated cell–cell junctions and increased EMT. These findings provide a novel mechanism by which oncogenic signal-transduction molecules regulate cell polarity and induction of EMT."

Although a dramatic phenotype for glucose metabolism has been found in SIK3-KO mice, additional complex phenotypes, dysregulation of bile acids, cholesterol, and fat homeostasis can render it difficult to discuss the hepatic functions of SIK3. The aim of this study was to examine the cell autonomous actions of SIK3 in hepatocytes. To eliminate systemic effects, we prepared primary hepatocytes and screened the small compounds suppressing SIK3 signaling cascades. SIK3-KO primary hepatocytes produced glucose more quickly after treatment with the cAMP agonist forskolin than the WT hepatocytes, which was accompanied by enhanced gluconeogenic gene expression and CRTC2 dephosphorylation. Reporter-based screening identified pterosin B as a SIK3 signaling-specific inhibitor. Pterosin B suppressed SIK3 downstream cascades by up-regulating the phosphorylation levels in the SIK3 C-terminal regulatory domain. When pterosin B promoted glucose production by up-regulating gluconeogenic gene expression in mouse hepatoma AML-12 cells, it decreased the glycogen content and stimulated an association between the glycogen phosphorylase kinase gamma subunit (PHKG2) and SIK3. PHKG2 phosphorylated the peptides with sequences of the C-terminal domain of SIK3. Here we found that the levels of active AMPK were higher both in the SIK3-KO hepatocytes and in pterosin B-treated AML-12 cells than in their controls.

Child neglect and abuse are pervasive and costly public health concerns with serious negative long-term effects on child health and development, including an increased risk of mental health disorders and substance abuse in later life (Rentesi et al., 2013Rentesi G.

Understanding the consequences of child abuse and neglect on neural processes that shape memories and guide behaviors is critical for developing psychological and pharmacological interventions to improve outcomes of these children. Synaptic plasticity (changes in synaptic strength) is an experience-dependent learning mechanism of the brain used to process and store information vital for survival. However, prolonged exposure to stress and addictive drugs dysregulates synaptic plasticity within mesocorticolimbic brain systems (i.e., the brain reward pathway), thereby shaping pathological learning of anxiety-, depressive-, and addictive-like behaviors (Sinha, 2008Sinha R. Chronic stress, drug use, and vulnerability to addiction.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2008; 1141: 105-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). A single 24-hr episode of early maternal deprivation (MD) in rodents has been widely used to model severe early-life stress such as child abuse and neglect.

DA release from the VTA is a key detector of reward response and is involved in reward-related learning. Dysregulation of DA signaling from the VTA has been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. However, whether early MD affects the reward learning processes and synaptic function in the VTA is unknown.

Nugent F.S. Opiates and plasticity.Neuropharmacology. 2011; 61: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Investigations are currently aiming to identify patterns of learning-related DA neuronal activity and signaling mechanisms that drive activity-dependent plasticity of VTA DA neurons. Such knowledge will lead to a better understanding of the function DA neurons serve in reward-related behaviors and how the brain reward circuitry is remodeled by stress and addictive drugs. There is an increasing interest in the functional roles of synaptic plasticity at inhibitory GABAergic synapses in brain circuits, particularly the brain reward pathway, where GABAergic dysfunction significantly contributes to the pathophysiology of depression, addiction, anxiety, and schizophrenia (Dacher and Nugent, 2011bDacher M. Nugent F.S. Opiates and plasticity.Neuropharmacology. 2011; 61: 1088-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Gao and Bao, 2011Gao S.F. Bao A.M. Corticotropin-releasing hormone, glutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid in depression.Neuroscientist. 2011; 17: 124-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Many of these are activated by early environmental experiences and shape neuronal plasticity, and hence behavior. Epigenetic modifications in the VTA such as DNA methylation are critical for the formation of reward learning (Day et al., 2013Day J.J. Childs D. Guzman-Karlsson M.C. Kibe M. Moulden J. Song E. Tahir A. Sweatt J.D. DNA methylation regulates associative reward learning.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Chromatin modifications by enzymes such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) also alter gene expression in neurons and neuroplasticity underlying memory formation (Abel and Zukin, 2008Abel T. Zukin R.S.

GABAA receptors (GABAAR) are epigenetically regulated in response to early-life stress and addictive drugs (Arora et al., 2013Arora D.S. Nimitvilai S. Teppen T.L. McElvain M.A. Sakharkar A.J. You C.

GABAAR signaling in DA neurons plays a key role in reward-motivated learning (Laviolette and van der Kooy, 2001Laviolette S.R. van der Kooy D.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 17103-17112Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, it is unknown which epigenetic mechanisms influence GABAergic plasticity and mediate maladaptive forms of such plasticity in the VTA. Because of the importance of GABAAR signaling in reward learning and the critical implications of epigenetic regulation of memory, stress-related disorders, schizophrenia, and addiction (Abel and Zukin, 2008Abel T.

Epigenetic regulation in memory and cognitive disorders.Neuroscience. 2014; 264: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that MD would trigger HDAC-mediated epigenetic changes in the gene encoding the scaffold protein AKAP150 (human 79/rodent 150, also referred to as AKAP5) in the VTA. AKAP150 is an important integrator of signaling molecules to glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses that control the synaptic trafficking underlying synaptic plasticity (Dacher et al., 2013Dacher M.

Epigenetic changes leading to altered AKAP signaling would in turn selectively reduce GABAergic inhibition in the VTA and thus contribute to the development of later psychopathology following MD. Indeed, AKAP proteins are epigenetically regulated (Choi et al., 2004Choi M.C. Jong H.S. Kim T.Y. Song S.H. Lee D.S. Lee J.W. Kim T.Y. Kim N.K. Bang Y.J.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 5648-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and global knockout of AKAP150 is associated with synaptic and behavioral abnormalities (Tunquist et al., 2008Tunquist B.J. Hoshi N. Guire E.S. Zhang F. Mullendorff K. Langeberg L.K. Raber J. Scott J.D. Loss of AKAP150 perturbs distinct neuronal processes in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 12557-12562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether a single 24-hr episode of MD, on postnatal day 9 (P9), would affect synaptic function and plasticity of VTA DA neurons through reversible epigenetic modifications of genes involved in AKAP signaling and learning mechanisms in the VTA. Our results suggest that MD induces an aberrant GABAergic metaplasticity through reversible epigenetic mechanisms that alter the AKAP signaling associated with memory formation in the VTA. Repeated or prolonged exposure to stress increases DA levels in projection areas of the VTA, leading to heightened impulsivity and anxiety-like behaviors from adolescence to adulthood (Meaney et al., 2002Meaney M.J. Brake W. Gratton A. Environmental regulation of the development of mesolimbic dopamine systems: a neurobiological mechanism for vulnerability to drug abuse?.Psychoneuroendocrinology. 2002; 27: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). MD-induced changes in synaptic transmission onto VTA DA neurons are likely to occur but have yet to be described. Stress effectively modulates synaptic plasticity at both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses onto DA neurons (Niehaus et al., 2010Niehaus J.L. Murali M. Kauer J.A. Drugs of abuse and stress impair LTP at inhibitory synapses in the ventral tegmental area.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 32: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, Saal et al., 2003Saal D.

Drugs of abuse and stress trigger a common synaptic adaptation in dopamine neurons.Neuron. 2003; 37: 577-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar); thus, we first tested whether MD induces an excitatory LTP in VTA DA neurons. Although acute stress potentiates glutamatergic synapses onto VTA DA neurons (Saal et al., 2003Saal D. Dong Y. Bonci A. Malenka R.C. Drugs of abuse and stress trigger a common synaptic adaptation in dopamine neurons.Neuron. 2003; 37: 577-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), we found that α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate receptor (AMPAR)/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor(NMDAR) ratios (AMPAR/NMDAR ratios) (commonly used as a reliable measurement for glutamatergic plasticity) measured in VTA DA neurons from 14- to 21-day-old non-MD and MD rats showed no significant difference (Figures 1A–1C, non-MD, n = 8: 0.86 ± 0.23; MD, n = 9: 0.81 ± 0.20; unpaired Student’s t test: p = 0.87501). To further test whether MD induced changes in the function and/or surface expression of AMPARs (postsynaptic plasticity) or glutamate release from glutamatergic terminals (presynaptic plasticity) onto VTA DA neurons, we recorded AMPAR-mediated miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in the presence of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 μM) in slices prepared from non-MD and MD rat pups. We found that the average and cumulative probability of AMPAR-mediated mEPSC amplitudes and frequencies did not differ between MD and non-MD rats, suggesting that MD did not change AMPAR function in VTA DA neurons (Figures 1F–1K, non-MD, n = 8: 13.47 ± 0.7 pA, 3.848 ± 0.36 Hz; MD, n = 9: 12.75 ± 0.59 pA, 3.249 ± 0.36 Hz; unpaired Student’s t tests: p = 0.19573 for amplitude, p = 0.12262 for frequency; Kolmogorov-Smirnov [KS] tests for cumulative distribution curves: p = 0.927 for amplitude, p = 0.989 for frequency). MD alters AMPAR and NMDAR subunit composition in the hippocampus (Pickering et al., 2006Pickering C. Gustafsson L. Cebere A. Nylander I. Liljequist S. Repeated maternal separation of male Wistar rats alters glutamate receptor expression in the hippocampus but not the prefrontal cortex.Brain Res. 2006; 1099: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Roceri et al., 2002Roceri M.

REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling promotes the developmental switch in synaptic NMDA receptors.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1382-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and given that such changes in AMPAR subunit composition could occur without alteration in overall synaptic strength measured by mEPSC amplitude or AMPAR/NMDAR ratios, we recorded evoked AMPAR-mediated EPSCs at different holding potentials while intracellularly applying spermine. This allowed us to detect the relative contribution of inwardly rectifying Ca2+-permeable/GluA2-lacking AMPARs to synaptic transmission. AMPAR rectification was unaltered after MD, and EPSC IV plots were linear in both groups. This is consistent with the presence of GluA2 in most synaptic AMPARs in MD rats, similar to non-MD rats (Figures 1D and 1E, AMPAR rectification indices: non-MD, n = 5: 1.444 ± 0.23; MD, n = 5: 1.4677 ± 0.33; unpaired Student’s t test: p = 0.9548; two-way ANOVA for IV curves, F(1,5) = 0.01102, p = 0.92047). Acute stress was previously shown to block a presynaptic form of LTP at GABAergic synapses onto VTA DA neurons (Niehaus et al., 2010Niehaus J.L. Murali M. Kauer J.A. Drugs of abuse and stress impair LTP at inhibitory synapses in the ventral tegmental area.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2010; 32: 108-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, Nugent et al., 2007Nugent F.S. Penick E.C. Kauer J.A. Opioids block long-term potentiation of inhibitory synapses.Nature. 2007; 446: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We tested the effects of MD on GABAAR-mediated miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) to identify whether MD per se induced any form of GABAergic plasticity. We found that the frequency and amplitude of mIPSCs were significantly reduced in MD compared to non-MD rats. (Figures 2A and 2B , non-MD, n = 6: 30.25 ± 0.2.44 pA, 4.92 ± 0.38 Hz; MD, n = 8: 22.33 ± 1.06 pA, 3.42 ± 0.45 Hz; unpaired Student’s t tests: p = 0.0067 for amplitude, p = 0.0316 for frequency; KS tests for cumulative distribution curves: p < 0.0001 for amplitude, p = 0.036 for frequency). These findings suggest that MD suppressed both pre- and postsynaptic function of GABAergic synapses onto VTA DA neurons. Previous experiences such as in vivo exposure to addictive drugs, stress, and sensory or visual deprivation can change the ability of synapses to undergo subsequent plasticity in response to LTP and LTD induction protocols. This phenomenon is referred as metaplasticity (Abraham and Bear, 1996Abraham W.C. Bear M.F. Metaplasticity: the plasticity of synaptic plasticity.Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Although traditional induction protocols of LTP and LTD have been successfully used to induce synaptic plasticity, near-coincidental pre- and postsynaptic firing can also trigger a form of plasticity where the precise timing and patterns of spikes are critical (i.e., spike timing-dependent plasticity, STDP). This is an attractive induction protocol since it mimics naturally occurring neuronal activity required for plasticity (Caporale and Dan, 2008Caporale N. Dan Y. Spike timing-dependent plasticity: a Hebbian learning rule.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 25-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that GABAergic synapses onto VTA DA neurons were capable of exhibiting a bidirectional postsynaptic Hebbian STDP (i.e., STD-LTPGABA and STD-LTDGABA in response to repeated pre-post spike pairings at positive interval of +15 ms and post-pre spike pairings at negative interval of −5 ms, respectively). Interestingly, this STDP was triggered by correlated activities of the presynaptic glutamatergic input and postsynaptic DA cells where NMDARs served as coincident detectors for this heterosynaptic plasticity (Kodangattil et al., 2013Kodangattil J.N. Dacher M. Authement M.E. Nugent F.S. Spike timing-dependent plasticity at GABAergic synapses in the ventral tegmental area.J. Physiol. 2013; 591: 4699-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Given that early MD is a potent stressor, we hypothesized that MD induces metaplastic changes in GABAergic synapses that subsequently alter the response of DA neurons to STDP protocols. Therefore, we used STDP protocols to induce GABAergic STDP in midbrain slices prepared from non-MD and MD rats. To define the temporal window for STDP induction, we tested three additional STDP protocols with different time intervals (−15 ms, +5 ms, and +25 ms). Data for time courses of STDP at these three additional intervals are shown in Figure S1, and the averaged magnitudes of synaptic change for all STDP experiments with a given Δt are depicted in Figure 3E. Pairings at a negative interval of −15 ms and a positive interval of +25 ms did not induce any form of plasticity in slices from non-MD or MD rats, demonstrating a short temporal window for GABAergic STDP in the VTA. Interestingly, a robust STD-LTDGABA was induced in response to pre-post positive pairing at +5 ms intervals in slices from MD rats while non-MD rats did not exhibit STDP at this time interval. Moreover, slices prepared from MD animals did not exhibit STD-LTPGABA at +15 ms (in fact, the polarity of STDP in response to pre-post pairings at this interval shifted toward LTD), whereas non-MD rats showed robust STD-LTPGABA. STD-LTDGABA (induced in response to negative pairings at −5 ms) was also absent in slices from MD rats, whereas plasticity was intact in slices from non-MD rats. Altogether these data suggest that MD-induced metaplastic changes impaired the ability of GABAergic synapses to exhibit normal bidirectional STDP, narrowed the STDP window, and shifted STDP toward LTD. In Figure 3, the time courses of STDP are only shown at the negative timing of −5 ms and positive timing of +15 ms. In the remainder of the paper, only these two intervals are used for STDP induction and are designated as “pre-post” for positive timing of +15 ms and “post-pre” for negative timing of −5 ms (Figures 3A and 3D, for STD-LTDGABA, non-MD, n = 6: 64% ± 2.4% of pre-STDP values, F11.53,57.67 = 11.09, p < 0.0001, MD, n = 7: 96% ± 2.7% of pre-STDP values, F9.43, 37.73 = 0.478, p = 0.886, unpaired Student’s t test for STD-LTDGABA between MD and non-MD rats, p < 0.001; Figures 3B and 3C for STD-LTPGABA: non-MD, n = 8: 151% ± 8.4% of pre-STDP values, F5.26,36.87 = 3.369, p = 0.012, MD, n = 8: 85% ± 21% of pre-STDP values, F3.32,23.26 = 3.368, p = 0.032, unpaired Student’s t test for STD-LTPGABA between MD and non-MD rats, p < 0.001; Figure 3E shows the temporal windows of STDP in non-MD and MD rats). Although we identified a shift in GABAergic STDP toward LTD following MD, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this metaplasticity remained unknown. To identify potential mechanisms of metaplasticity, we first characterized STDP. Previously we discovered that the AKAP150 complex selectively controlled GABAAR trafficking-mediated GABAergic plasticity in the VTA. Postsynaptic disruption of Protein Kinase A (PKA)-AKAP association or PKA inhibition induced a calcineurin (CaN)-dependent, long-lasting reduction in synaptic GABAA responses that mimicked LTDGABA (induced in response to a traditional LTD pairing protocol) without affecting AMPAR-mediated glutamatergic transmission in VTA DA neurons (Dacher et al., 2013Dacher M. Gouty S. Dash S. Cox B.M. Nugent F.S. A-kinase anchoring protein-calcineurin signaling in long-term depression of GABAergic synapses.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 2650-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, Dacher and Nugent, 2011aDacher M. Nugent F.S. Morphine-induced modulation of LTD at GABAergic synapses in the ventral tegmental area.Neuropharmacology. 2011; 61: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here, we determined whether the PKA-AKAP-CaN complex also underlies GABAergic STDP. Consistent with our previous results, intra-pipette AKAP inhibitor Ht31 (1 μM) resulted in a remarkably rapid rundown of synaptic transmission, whereas control peptide Ht31p (1 μM) did not (Figure 4A, Ht31p cells, n = 19: 93% ± 4% of the first 5-min baseline values, F10.387, 46.161 = 1.035, p = 0.44; Ht31 cells, n = 14: 58% ± 1% of the first 5-min baseline values, F15.902, 47.707 = 6.614, p < 0.00001). Once Ht31-induced depression plateaued, STDP protocols were used to trigger STD-LTPGABA or STD-LTDGABA. Intra-pipette Ht31 prevented the induction of STD-LTPGABA, while Ht31p-filled cells expressed STD-LTPGABA (Figures 4B and 4C, Ht31p cells, n = 7: 140% ± 2% of pre-STDP values, F10.127,9.922 = 6.124, p < 0.0001; Ht31 cells, n = 7: 99.3% ± 2.8% of pre-STDP values, F11.78,47.151 = 0.93, p = 0.453). Moreover, intra-pipette Ht31-induced rundown occluded STD-LTDGABA, whereas Ht31p did not affect the plasticity (Figure 5A, Ht31p cells, n = 12: 71% ± 2% of pre-STDP values, F9.192, 45.962 = 6.316, p < 0.0001; Ht31 cells, n = 7: 105% ± 3% of pre-STDP values, F14.945, 59.779 = 0.878, p = 0.591), suggesting that the disruption of association between PKA and AKAP is sufficient to induce STD-LTDGABA. Consistent with our previous results, postsynaptic inhibition of PKA by intracellular inclusion of PKI(6-22) (10 μM), a membrane-impermeant PKA inhibitor, significantly reduced IPSC amplitude (Figures 4D and 4E; PKI cells, n = 6: 63% ± 2% of the first 5-min baseline values, F11.37,45.48 = 21.145, p < 0.0001). PKI(6-22)-induced depression of IPSCs not only inhibited STD-LTPGABA but also shifted the polarity of plasticity toward LTD (Figures 4E and 4F; control STD-LTP for PKI(6-22), n = 7: 121% ± 1.4% of pre-STDP values, F8.58,34.34 = 3.356, p = 0.005; PKI(6-22) cells, n = 6: 76.6% ± 1.1% of pre-STDP values, F16.95,50.86 = 3.14"
https://openalex.org/W1755000079,"Ectoplasmic specialization (ES) is an actin-rich adherens junction in the seminiferous epithelium of adult mammalian testes. ES is restricted to the Sertoli-spermatid (apical ES) interface, as well as the Sertoli cell-cell (basal ES) interface at the blood-testis barrier (BTB). ES is typified by the presence of an array of bundles of actin microfilaments near the Sertoli cell plasma membrane. These actin microfilament bundles require rapid debundling to convert them from a bundled to branched/unbundled configuration and vice versa to confer plasticity to support the transport of 1) spermatids in the adluminal compartment and 2) preleptotene spermatocytes at the BTB while maintaining cell adhesion. Plastin 3 is one of the plastin family members abundantly found in yeast, plant and animal cells that confers actin microfilaments their bundled configuration. Herein, plastin 3 was shown to be a component of the apical and basal ES in the rat testis, displaying spatiotemporal expression during the epithelial cycle. A knockdown (KD) of plastin 3 in Sertoli cells by RNA interference using an in vitro model to study BTB function showed that a transient loss of plastin 3 perturbed the Sertoli cell tight junction-permeability barrier, mediated by changes in the localization of basal ES proteins N-cadherin and β-catenin. More importantly, these changes were the result of an alteration of the actin microfilaments, converting from their bundled to branched configuration when examined microscopically, and validated by biochemical assays that quantified actin-bundling and polymerization activity. Moreover, these changes were confirmed by studies in vivo by plastin 3 KD in the testis in which mis-localization of N-cadherin and β-catenin was also detected at the BTB, concomitant with defects in the transport of spermatids and phagosomes and a disruption of cell adhesion most notably in elongated spermatids due to a loss of actin-bundling capability at the apical ES, which in turn affected localization of adhesion protein complexes at the site. In summary, plastin 3 is a regulator of actin microfilament bundles at the ES in which it dictates the configuration of the filamentous actin network by assuming either a bundled or unbundled/branched configuration via changes in its spatiotemporal expression during the epithelial cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2147270226,"The ubiquitin system plays a critical role in muscle wasting. Previous work has focused on the roles of ubiquitination. However, a role for deubiquitination in this process has not been established. Because ubiquitin-specific protease (USP)19 deubiquitinating enzyme is induced in skeletal muscle in many catabolic conditions, we generated USP19 knockout (KO) mice. These mice lost less muscle mass than wild-type (WT) animals in response to glucocorticoids, a common systemic cause of muscle atrophy as well as in response to denervation, a model of disuse atrophy. KO mice retained more strength and had less myofiber atrophy with both type I and type IIb fibers being protected. Rates of muscle protein synthesis were similar in WT and KO mice, suggesting that the sparing of atrophy was attributed to suppressed protein degradation. Consistent with this, expression of the ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx/atrogin-1 as well as several autophagy genes was decreased in the muscles of catabolic KO mice. Expression of USP19 correlates with that of MuRF1 and MAFbx/atrogin-1 in skeletal muscles from patients with lung cancer or gastrointestinal cancer, suggesting that USP19 is involved in human muscle wasting. Inhibition of USP19 may be a useful approach to the treatment of many muscle-wasting conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1603927759,"This study was carried out to investigate the suitability of using the optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) in measuring surface dose during radiotherapy. The water equivalent depth (WED) of the OSLD was first determined by comparing the surface dose measured using the OSLD with the percentage depth dose at the buildup region measured using a Markus ionization chamber. Surface doses were measured on a solid water phantom using the OSLD and compared against the Markus ionization chamber and Gafchromic EBT3 film measurements. The effect of incident beam angles on surface dose was also studied. The OSLD was subsequently used to measure surface dose during tangential breast radiotherapy treatments in a phantom study and in the clinical measurement of 10 patients. Surface dose to the treated breast or chest wall, and on the contralateral breast were measured. The WED of the OSLD was found to be at 0.4 mm. For surface dose measurement on a solid water phantom, the Markus ionization chamber measured 15.95% for 6 MV photon beam and 12.64% for 10 MV photon beam followed by EBT3 film (23.79% and 17.14%) and OSLD (37.77% and 25.38%). Surface dose increased with the increase of the incident beam angle. For phantom and patient breast surface dose measurement, the response of the OSLD was higher than EBT3 film. The in-vivo measurements were also compared with the treatment planning system predicted dose. The OSLD measured higher dose values compared to dose at the surface (Hp(0.0)) by a factor of 2.37 for 6 MV and 2.01 for 10 MV photon beams, respectively. The measurement of absorbed dose at the skin depth of 0.4 mm by the OSLD can still be a useful tool to assess radiation effects on the skin dermis layer. This knowledge can be used to prevent and manage potential acute skin reaction and late skin toxicity from radiotherapy treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2200866454,"Background Adeno associated virus (AAV) is well known for its ability to deliver transgenes to retina and to mediate improvements in animal models and patients with inherited retinal disease. Although the field is less advanced, there is growing interest in AAV’s ability to target cells of the anterior segment. The purpose of our study was to fully articulate a reliable and reproducible method for injecting the anterior chamber (AC) of mice and rats and to investigate the transduction profiles of AAV2- and AAV8-based capsid mutants containing self-complementary (sc) genomes in the anterior segment of the eye. Methodology/Principle Findings AC injections were performed in C57BL/6 mice and Sprague Dawley rats. The cornea was punctured anterior of the iridocorneal angle. To seal the puncture site and to prevent reflux an air bubble was created in the AC. scAAVs expressing GFP were injected and transduction was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Both parent serotype and capsid modifications affected expression. scAAV2- based vectors mediated efficient GFP-signal in the corneal endothelium, ciliary non-pigmented epithelium (NPE), iris and chamber angle including trabecular meshwork, with scAAV2(Y444F) and scAAV2(triple) being the most efficient. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study to semi quantitatively evaluate transduction of anterior segment tissues following injection of capsid-mutated AAV vectors. scAAV2- based vectors transduced corneal endothelium, ciliary NPE, iris and trabecular meshwork more effectively than scAAV8-based vectors. Mutagenesis of surface-exposed tyrosine residues greatly enhanced transduction efficiency of scAAV2 in these tissues. The number of Y-F mutations was not directly proportional to transduction efficiency, however, suggesting that proteosomal avoidance alone may not be sufficient. These results are applicable to the development of targeted, gene-based strategies to investigate pathological processes of the anterior segment and may be applied toward the development of gene-based therapies for glaucoma and acquired or inherited corneal anomalies."

DJ-1 has various functions, and the oxidative status of cysteine at position 106 (Cys-106) is crucial for determination of the activation level of DJ-1. Although DJ-1 requires activated Ras for its oncogenic activity and although it activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, a cell growth pathway downstream of Ras, the precise mechanism underlying activation of the ERK pathway by DJ-1 is still not known. In this study, we found that DJ-1 directly bound to the kinase domain of c-Raf but not to Ras and that Cys-106 mutant DJ-1 bound to c-Raf more weakly than did wild-type DJ-1. Co-localization of DJ-1 with c-Raf in the cytoplasm was enhanced in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-treated cells. Knockdown of DJ-1 expression attenuated the phosphorylation level of c-Raf in EGF-treated cells, resulting in reduced activation of MEK and ERK1/2. Although EGF-treated DJ-1 knock-out cells also showed attenuated c-Raf activation, reintroduction of wild-type DJ-1, but not C106S DJ-1, into DJ-1 knock-out cells restored c-Raf activation in a DJ-1 binding activity in a c-Raf-dependent manner. DJ-1 was not responsible for activation of c-Raf in phorbol myristate acetate-treated cells. Furthermore, DJ-1 stimulated self-phosphorylation activity of c-Raf in vitro, but DJ-1 was not a target for Raf kinase. Oxidation of Cys-106 in DJ-1 was not affected by EGF treatment. These findings showed that DJ-1 is a positive regulator of the EGF/Ras/ERK pathway through targeting c-Raf. DJ-1 is an oncogene and also a causative gene for familial Parkinson disease.

https://openalex.org/W1700658054,"Several growth factors (GFs) have been implicated in long-term memory (LTM), but no single GF can support all of the plastic changes that occur during memory formation. Because GFs engage highly convergent signaling cascades that often mediate similar functional outcomes, the relative contribution of any particular GF to LTM is difficult to ascertain. To explore this question, we determined the unique contribution of distinct GF families (signaling via TrkB and TGF-βr-II) to LTM formation in Aplysia. We demonstrate that TrkB and TGF-βr-II signaling are differentially recruited during two-trial training in both time (by trial 1 or 2, respectively) and space (in distinct subcellular compartments). These GFs independently regulate MAPK activation and synergistically regulate gene expression. We also show that trial 1 TrkB and trial 2 TGF-βr-II signaling are required for LTM formation. These data support the view that GFs engaged in LTM formation are interactive components of a complex molecular network."
https://openalex.org/W582360159,"Exposure of platelets to collagen triggers the formation of a platelet clot. Pharmacological agents capable of inhibiting platelet activation by collagen are thus of potential therapeutic interest. Thrombus formation is initiated by the interaction of the GPIb-V-IX complex with collagen-bound vWF, while GPVI interaction with collagen triggers platelet activation that is reinforced by ADP and thromboxane A2. Losartan is an angiotensin II (Ang II) type I receptor (AT1R) antagonist proposed to have an antiplatelet activity via the inhibition of both the thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor (TP) and the glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Here, we characterized in vitro the effects of losartan at different doses on platelet responses: losartan inhibited platelet aggregation and secretion induced by 1 μg . mL(-1) and 10 μg . mL(-1) of collagen with an IC50 of ~ 6 μM. Losartan inhibited platelet responses induced by the GPVI specific collagen related peptide but not by the α2β1 specific peptide. However, losartan did not inhibit the binding of recombinant GPVI to collagen, which is not in favor of a simple competition. Indeed, the clustering of GPVI observed in flow cytometry and using the Duolink methodology, was inhibited by losartan. The impact of a therapeutic dose of losartan (100 mg/day) on platelet responses was analyzed ex vivo in a double blind study. No statistically significant differences were observed between losartan-treated (n=25) and non-treated (n=30) patients in terms of collagen and U46619-induced platelet activation. These data indicate that in treated patients, losartan does not achieve a measurable antiplatelet effect but provide the proof of concept that inhibiting collagen-induced GPVI clustering is of pharmacological interest to obtain an antithrombotic efficacy.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00763893."
https://openalex.org/W590350978,"Different Leishmania species cause distinct clinical manifestations of the infectious disease leishmaniasis. It is fundamentally important to understand the mechanisms governing the interaction between Leishmania and its host cell. Little is known about this interaction between Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis and human macrophages. In this study, we aimed to identify differential gene expression between non-infected and L. (V) braziliensis-infected U937-derived macrophages. We deployed a whole human transcriptome microarray analysis using 72 hours post-infection samples and compared those samples with their non-infected counterparts. We found that 218 genes were differentially expressed between infected and non-infected macrophages. A total of 71.6% of these genes were down-regulated in the infected macrophages. Functional enrichment analyses identified the steroid and sterol/cholesterol biosynthetic processes between regulatory networks down-regulated in infected macrophages. RT-qPCR further confirmed this down-regulation in genes belonging to these pathways. These findings contrast with those from studies involving other Leishmania species at earlier infection stages, where gene up-regulation for this metabolic pathway has been reported. Sterol biosynthesis could be an important biological process associated with the expression profile of macrophages infected by L. (V.) braziliensis. Differential transcriptional results suggest a negative regulation of the genetic regulatory network involved in cholesterol biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1608898022,"Background Anaemia is an increasingly recognized health problem in Africa, particularly in infants and pregnant women. Although malaria is known to be the main risk factor of anaemia in both groups, the consequences of maternal factors, particularly malaria in pregnancy (MiP), on infant haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations during the first months of life are still unclear. Methods We followed-up a cohort of 1005 Beninese pregnant women from the beginning of pregnancy until delivery. A subsample composed of the first 400 offspring of these women were selected at birth and followed until the first year of life. Placental histology and blood smear at 1st clinical antenatal visit (ANC), 2nd ANC and delivery were used to assess malaria during pregnancy. Infant Hb concentrations were measured at birth, 6, 9 and 12 months of age. A mixed multi-level model was used to assess the association between MiP and infant Hb variations during the first 12 months of life. Results Placental malaria (difference mean [dm] = - 2.8 g/L, 95% CI [-5.3, -0.3], P = 0.03) and maternal peripheral parasitaemia at delivery (dm = - 4.6 g/L, 95% CI [-7.9, -1.3], P = 0.007) were the main maternal factors significantly associated with infant Hb concentrations during the first year of life. Poor maternal nutritional status and malaria infection during infancy were also significantly associated with a decrease in infant Hb. Conclusion Antimalarial control and nutritional interventions before and during pregnancy should be reinforced to reduce specifically the incidence of infant anaemia, particularly in Sub-Saharan countries."
https://openalex.org/W2101151463,"Inflammation and immune activation of the cervicovaginal mucosa are considered factors that increase susceptibility to HIV infection. Therefore, it is essential to screen candidate anti-HIV microbicides for potential mucosal immunomodulatory/inflammatory effects prior to further clinical development. The goal of this study was to develop an in vitro method for preclinical evaluation of the inflammatory potential of new candidate microbicides using a microarray gene expression profiling strategy.To this end, we compared transcriptomes of human vaginal cells (Vk2/E6E7) treated with well-characterized pro-inflammatory (PIC) and non-inflammatory (NIC) compounds. PICs included compounds with different mechanisms of action. Gene expression was analyzed using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2 arrays. Data processing was performed using GeneSpring 11.5 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).Microarraray comparative analysis allowed us to generate a panel of 20 genes that were consistently deregulated by PICs compared to NICs, thus distinguishing between these two groups. Functional analysis mapped 14 of these genes to immune and inflammatory responses. This was confirmed by the fact that PICs induced NFkB pathway activation in Vk2 cells. By testing microbicide candidates previously characterized in clinical trials we demonstrated that the selected PIC-associated genes properly identified compounds with mucosa-altering effects. The discriminatory power of these genes was further demonstrated after culturing vaginal cells with vaginal bacteria. Prevotella bivia, prevalent bacteria in the disturbed microbiota of bacterial vaginosis, induced strong upregulation of seven selected PIC-associated genes, while a commensal Lactobacillus gasseri associated to vaginal health did not cause any changes.In vitro evaluation of the immunoinflammatory potential of microbicides using the PIC-associated genes defined in this study could help in the initial screening of candidates prior to entering clinical trials. Additional characterization of these genes can provide further insight into the cervicovaginal immunoinflammatory and mucosal-altering processes that facilitate or limit HIV transmission with implications for the design of prevention strategies."

The included studies were analyzed using RevMan 5.1.0 software. The literature search yielded 460 studies, wherein 16 studies matched the selection criteria. The results showed that combined therapy using Breviscapine plus Western medicine was superior to Western medicine alone for improving angina pectoris symptoms (OR=3.77, 95% Cl: 2.76~5.15) and also resulted in increased electrocardiogram (ECG) improvement (OR=2.77, 95% Cl: 2.16~3.53).

Saturated phosphatidylcholine (SatPC), the major component of surfactant, is synthesized both de novo and by the remodeling of unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) by lyso-PC acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1). After synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, SatPC is routed to lamellar bodies (LBs) for storage prior to secretion. The mechanism by which SatPC is transported to LB is not understood. The specificity of LPCAT1 for lyso-PC as an acyl acceptor suggests that formation of SatPC via LPCAT1 reacylation is a final step in SatPC synthesis prior to transport. We hypothesized that LPCAT1 forms a transient complex with SatPC and specific phospholipid transport protein(s) to initiate trafficking of SatPC from the endoplasmic reticulum to the LB. Herein we have assessed the ability of different StarD proteins to interact with LPCAT1. We found that LPCAT1 interacts with StarD10, that this interaction is direct, and that amino acids 79–271 of LPCAT1 and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domain of START domain-containing protein 10 (StarD10) are sufficient for this interaction. The role of StarD10 in trafficking of phospholipid to LB was confirmed by the observation that knockdown of StarD10 significantly reduced transport of phospholipid to LB.

Because reacylation of lyso-PC is a final step in SatPC synthesis prior to its trafficking to LB, we hypothesized that LPCAT1 forms a transient complex with SatPC and a specific phospholipid transport protein(s) to initiate the movement of SatPC from the ER to the LB. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) proteins are non-vesicular lipid transporters that facilitate intracellular lipid trafficking between cellular membranes (39Alpy F.

All protocols involving mice were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center. The studies utilizing wild-type mice were done using strain FVB/N (Harlan Laboratories, Madison, WI). Lungs for ontogeny studies were obtained from timed fetuses on embryonic (E) days E11.5 through E18.5. Lungs were also obtained from postnatal (PN) animals on days PN0, PN1, PN7, and PN14 as well as from adults. Adult type II cells for gene expression studies were isolated by FACS from surfactant protein C/GFP mice that express green fluorescent protein under control of the human SFTPC promoter (45Lo B.

Changes in gene expression are expressed as -fold changes versus controls. To generate the StarD constructs, total adult mouse liver RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA fragments for coding sequences with a FLAG (DYKDDDDK) or HA (YPYDVPDYA) tag added to the 3′-end were generated by PCR for StarD2/PCTP, StarD7, and StarD10 using the primers listed in Table 1; a unique restriction site was also added to the 5′-end of each primer to facilitate directional cloning. The resultant StarD2-HA, StarD7-I-HA, StarD7-II-HA, StarD10-HA, and StarD10-FLAG PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). The resulting expression constructs were sequenced in both directions to ensure that no mutations were introduced by PCR amplification. Expression of StarD10-HA, StarD10-FLAG, StarD2-HA, StarD7-I-HA, and StarD7-II-HA proteins was tested by transient transfection of HEK293 cells followed by immunoblotting using anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) or anti-FLAG antibody (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to detect recombinant protein.TABLE 1List of cloning primersNamesPrimer sequence (5′ to 3′)5′HindIII/LPCAT1-aa49CTTAAGCTTGCAGCCATGACGTTGACGCTG5′HindIII/LPCAT1-aa79CTTAAGCTTGCCACCATGCCTCCTGATAAGGAG3′LPCAT1-aa211/BsrGIGAGGCAGGTCCTATTTGTACA5′HindIII/LPCAT1-aa272CCCAAGCTTGCAGCCATGGAATTTCTGCCTGTGTAT3′HA/BamHIATGGATCCCTATGCATAGTCCGGGAC5′EcoRI/LPCAT1TGGAATTCGCCACCATGAGGCTGCGGGGC3′LPCAT1-aa271+HA/XhoICCGCTCGAGCTATGCATAGTCCGGGACGTCATAGGGATAAATTTCCACTTGGTT3′LPCAT1-aa271+FLAG/BamHIGCGGATCCCTATTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCAATTTCCACTTGGTT3′LPCAT1-aa239+HA/XhoICCGCTCGAGCTATGCATAGTCCGGGACGTCATAGGGATATGGGTAGCGTAGCACCAC5′HindIII/LPCAT1-aa114CTTAAGCTTGCCACCATGCGTGTAGCTGTGAAGGG3′LPCAT1-aa239+FLAG/XhoICCGCTCGAGCTACCTTTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCTGGGTAGCGTAGCACCAC5′EcoRI/StarD2TGGAATTCGGAAGGATGGCGGGGGCC3′StarD2+HA/XbaICCTCTAGATTATGCATAGTCCGGGACGTCATAGGGATAGGTTTTCTTGTGGTA5′EcoRI/StarD10TGGAATTCGCCACCATGGAAAAGCCAGCT3′StarD10+FLAG/XbaICCTCTAGATCATTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCGGTGAGCGAGGTGTC3′StarD10+HA/XbaICCTCTAGATCATGCATAGTCCGGGACGTCATAGGGATAGGTGAGCGAGGTGTC3′StarD10-aa227+HA/XbaICCTCTAGATCATGCATAGTCCGGGACGTCATAGGGATACTGCTTCCACTCGGG5′BamHI/StarD10-aa19CGGGATCCGCCACCATGCGTGAAAGTGTCCAG3′StarD10-aa227+FLAG/XbaICCTCTAGATCATTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCCTGCTTCCACTCGGG5′EcoRI/StarD7ITGGAATTCGCCGACATGTTCCCGA3′StarD7I+HA/XbaITCTAGATTATGCATAGTCCGGGACGTCATAGGGATAAGCATACTCAATCCG5′EcoRI/StarD7I-aa79TGGAATTCGCCGACATGGCGGCGCTCTCCGGT5′BglII/StarD7IGGACTCAGATCTATGTTCCCGAGGAGG3′StarD7I-aa78+FLAG/BamHIGCGGATCCTTTATCATCATCATCTTTATAATCCAAAACAGAGGCATG Open table in a new tab The generation and use of the LPCAT1 expression constructs LPCAT1-FLAG and LPCAT1-HA have been described previously (15Bridges J.P.

Investig. 2010; 120: 1736-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To determine the domains required for the LPCAT1 and StarD protein interaction, the following deletion constructs were generated by PCR using the appropriate full-length expression construct as template with primers listed in Table 1: LPCAT1(49–534)-HA, LPCAT1(79–534)-HA, LPCAT1(272–534)-HA, LPCAT1(1–271)-HA, LPCAT1(79–271)-HA, LPCAT1(114–239)-HA, StarD10(1–227)-HA, and StarD10(19–227)-FLAG. The truncated fragments were cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1(+), and their sequence fidelity was confirmed. The expression vector StarD7-I(1–78)-FLAG was constructed by inserting the DNA sequence coding Met1–Leu78 plus a FLAG tag into the vector pEGFP-CI (BD Biosciences). HEK293 cells were transfected with LPCAT1 and StarD constructs (either singly or in combination) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells transfected with empty vector served as controls. 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis/binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of anti-FLAG M2 antibody bound to agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich); resins conjugated with anti-FLAG antibody were used to circumvent detection problems caused by free immunoglobulins. The beads were washed and boiled in 25 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody; 5% of cell lysates was used as input on a protein gel for all experiments. Expression levels of FLAG-tagged bait and HA-tagged prey proteins were demonstrated by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibody, respectively. Co-IP was also carried out by pulling down protein complexes with anti-StarD10 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Protein G-Sepharose (Invitrogen) followed by immunoblotting using anti-LPCAT1 antibody (15Bridges J.P.

To determine whether LPCAT1 interacts directly with StarD10, full-length LPCAT1 and StarD10 cDNAs were cloned into the expression vectors pET-24a (Novagen, Madison, WI) and pGEX-4T-1 (Ge Healthcare) to generate pET-24a/LPCAT1, pET-24a/StarD10, pGEX-4T/LPCAT1, and pGEX-4T/StarD10 constructs. The resulting constructs were used to transform bacterial strain BD21 (Novagen). Expression of GST-LPCAT1 and GST-StarD10 recombinant proteins was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) for 4 h, whereas LPCAT1-His and StarD10-His were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The recombinant proteins were subsequently purified with GST- or His-resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, bacterial pellets for GST-LPCAT1 or GST-StarD10 were lysed in GST bind/wash buffer (4.3 mm NaHPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.2) with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 5 mm imidazole plus proteinase inhibitor, sonicated, and cleared. The resulting supernatants were incubated with GST-resin. Protein-bound resins were washed and eluted with GST elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm reduced glutathione). Bacterial pellets for LPCAT1-His or StarD10-His were lysed in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole) with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 plus proteinase inhibitor, sonicated, and cleared. The resulting supernatants were incubated with nickel-charged His-resin. Protein-bound resins were washed and eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 1 m imidazole). The concentrations of the purified proteins were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). 20 μg of GST-LPCAT1 and StarD10-His proteins were diluted in 1 ml of GST bind/wash buffer and incubated with 50 μl of GST-resin overnight at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-StarD10 and anti-LPCAT1 antibodies. To examine the converse interaction, LPCAT1-His and GST-StarD10 recombinant proteins were precipitated with GST-resin and then immunoblotted with anti-LPCAT1 and anti-StarD10 antibodies. Adult mouse lungs were inflation-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, then embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature embedding medium, and frozen. PLA was performed on 6-μm frozen sections using the Duolink In Situ kit (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after antigen retrieval, lung sections were incubated with rabbit anti-LPCAT1 (1:150; ProteinTech, Chicago, IL) and mouse anti-StarD10 (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Substitution of normal rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for each primary antibody served as negative controls. PLA was performed with anti-rabbit PLUS and anti-mouse MINUS Duolink PLA probes. In situ ligation and subsequent amplification were carried out at 37 °C for 30 and 100 min, respectively.

Changes in the metabolic properties of skeletal muscle enable the female body to cope with the physiological challenges of pregnancy and may also be linked to the development of insulin resistance.

We demonstrate that pregnancy promotes fiber-type changes from an oxidative to glycolytic isoform in skeletal muscle. This phenomenon is regulated through an interaction between SMTNL1 and progesterone receptor, which alters the expression of contractile and metabolic proteins. smtnl1−/− mice are metabolically less efficient and show impaired glucose tolerance. Pregnancy antagonizes these effects by inducing metabolic activity and increasing glucose tolerance.

https://openalex.org/W595109667,"We recently reported that brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein 3 (BIG3) binds Prohibitin 2 (PHB2) in cytoplasm, thereby causing a loss of function of the PHB2 tumor suppressor in the nuclei of breast cancer cells. However, little is known regarding the mechanism by which BIG3 inhibits the nuclear translocation of PHB2 into breast cancer cells. Here, we report that BIG3 blocks the estrogen (E2)-dependent nuclear import of PHB2 via the karyopherin alpha (KPNA) family in breast cancer cells. We found that overexpressed PHB2 interacted with KPNA1, KPNA5, and KPNA6, thereby leading to the E2-dependent translocation of PHB2 into the nuclei of breast cancer cells. More importantly, knockdown of each endogenous KPNA by siRNA caused a significant inhibition of E2-dependent translocation of PHB2 in BIG3-depleted breast cancer cells, thereby enhancing activation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). These data indicated that BIG3 may block the KPNAs (KPNA1, KPNA5, and KPNA6) binding region(s) of PHB2, thereby leading to inhibition of KPNAs-mediated PHB2 nuclear translocation in the presence of E2 in breast cancer cells. Understanding this regulation of PHB2 nuclear import may provide therapeutic strategies for controlling E2/ERα signals in breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W599991710,"The membrane glycolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer) plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis. Its intracellular levels are thought to be tightly regulated. How cells regulate GlcCer levels remains to be clarified. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a crucial cellular energy sensor, regulates glucose and lipid metabolism to maintain energy homeostasis. Here, we investigated whether AMPK affects GlcCer metabolism. AMPK activators (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside and metformin) decreased intracellular GlcCer levels and synthase activity in mouse fibroblasts. AMPK inhibitors or AMPK siRNA reversed these effects, suggesting that GlcCer synthesis is negatively regulated by an AMPK-dependent mechanism. Although AMPK did not affect the phosphorylation or expression of GlcCer synthase, the amount of UDP-glucose, an activated form of glucose required for GlcCer synthesis, decreased under AMPK-activating conditions. Importantly, the UDP-glucose pyrophosphatase Nudt14, which degrades UDP-glucose, generating UMP and glucose 1-phosphate, was phosphorylated and activated by AMPK. On the other hand, suppression of Nudt14 by siRNA had little effect on UDP-glucose levels, indicating that mammalian cells have an alternative UDP-glucose pyrophosphatase that mainly contributes to the reduction of UDP-glucose under AMPK-activating conditions. Because AMPK activators are capable of reducing GlcCer levels in cells from Gaucher disease patients, our findings suggest that reducing GlcCer through AMPK activation may lead to a new strategy for treating diseases caused by abnormal accumulation of GlcCer."

One hundred and thirty three biopsy samples were taken during these research operations in Willapa Bay, Washington and in San Francisco Bay, California. Genotypic data from seven polymorphic microsatellites (derived from the related sixgill shark, Hexanchus griseus) were used to describe N. cepedianus genetic diversity, population structure and relatedness. Diversity within N. cepedianus was found to be low to moderate with an average observed heterozygosity of 0.41, expected heterozygosity of 0.53, and an average of 5.1 alleles per microsatellite locus. There was no evidence of a recent population bottleneck based on genetic data. Analyses of genetic differences between the two sampled estuaries suggest two distinct populations with some genetic mixing of sharks sampled during 2005-2006. Relatedness within sampled populations was high, with percent relatedness among sharks caught in the same area indicating 42.30% first-order relative relationships (full or half siblings). Estuary-specific familial relationships suggest that management of N. cepedianus on the U.S. West Coast should incorporate stock-specific management goals to conserve this ecologically important predator."

We observed an initial decrease in type I (at the 3rd day) and type III collagen (from the 6th hour until the 3rd day), in posterior time points in which we detected increased gene expression for MMP-8 and -13 in PPE groups. After 21 days, the type III collagen fibers increased and the type I collagen values returned to similar values compared to control groups. The MMP-12 gene expression was increased in earlier times (3 and 6 hours) to which we detected a reduced proportion of elastin (3 days) in PPE groups, reinforcing the already established importance of MMP-12 in the breakdown of ECM. Such findings will be useful to better elucidate the alterations in ECM components and the importance of not only metalloelastase but also collagenases in earlier emphysema stages, providing new clues to novel therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W1527123618,"Dopamine (DA) is a major regulator of sensorimotor and cognitive functions. The DA transporter (DAT) is the key protein that regulates the spatial and temporal activity of DA release into the synaptic cleft via the rapid reuptake of DA into presynaptic termini.

Here, we identified the tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein Ctr9 as a novel DAT binding partner using a yeast two-hybrid system. We showed that Ctr9 is expressed in dopaminergic neurons and forms a stable complex with DAT in vivo via GST pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays. In mammalian cells co-expressing both proteins, Ctr9 partially colocalizes with DAT at the plasma membrane. This interaction between DAT and Ctr9 results in a dramatic enhancement of DAT-mediated DA uptake due to an increased number of DAT transporters at the plasma membrane. We determined that the binding of Ctr9 to DAT requires residues YKF in the first half of the DAT C terminus. In addition, we characterized Ctr9, providing new insight into this protein. Using three-dimensional modeling, we identified three novel tetratricopeptide repeat domains in the Ctr9 sequence, and based on deletion mutation experiments, we demonstrated the role of the SH2 domain of Ctr9 in nuclear localization.

Cells were characterized for viability by calcein fluorescence, phenotype retention by immunocytochemistry, metabolic parameters (pH, glucose, lactate, and O2) within the storage medium by blood gas analysis, and morphology by scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy.Relative to the cultured, but non-stored control cells, a high percentage of viable cells were retained only in the 12 °C and 16 °C storage groups (85% ± 13% and 68% ± 10%, respectively). Expression of ABCG2, Bmi1, C/EBPδ, PCNA, cytokeratin 18, and caspase-3 were preserved after storage in the 5 groups between 4 °C and 20 °C, compared to the non-stored control. Glucose, pH and pO2 in the storage medium declined, whereas lactate increased with increasing storage temperature. Morphology was best preserved following storage of the three groups between 12 °C, 16 °C, and 20 °C.We conclude that storage temperatures of 12 °C and 16 °C were optimal for maintenance of cell viability, phenotype, and morphology of cultured HOK. The storage method described in the present study may be applicable for other cell types and tissues; thus its significance may extend beyond HOK and the field of ophthalmology."

We examined participation in clinic-based lifestyle counseling/education and subsequent weight loss.Of the total cohort, 599 (45.6%) patients received counseling/education with (26.2%) and without (19.4%) medication, 298(22.7%) patients received a prescription for medication alone, and 417(31.7%) patients were only monitored. On average, those who participated in counseling/education attended 2.5 sessions (approximately 2-3 hours). The average weight loss of patients who received counseling/education alone during the follow-up period (up to three years post-exposure to participation) was 6.3 lbs.

https://openalex.org/W1518589975,"Conantokins are ∼20-amino acid peptides present in predatory marine snail venoms that function as allosteric antagonists of ion channels of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). These peptides possess a high percentage of post-/co-translationally modified amino acids, particularly γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). Appropriately spaced Gla residues allow binding of functional divalent cations, which induces end-to-end α-helices in many conantokins. A smaller number of these peptides additionally contain 4-hydroxyproline (Hyp). Hyp should prevent adoption of the metal ion-induced full α-helix, with unknown functional consequences. To address this disparity, as well as the role of Hyp in conantokins, we have solved the high resolution three-dimensional solution structure of a Gla/Hyp-containing 18-residue conantokin, conRl-B, by high field NMR spectroscopy. We show that Hyp10 disrupts only a small region of the α-helix of the Mn2+·peptide complex, which displays cation-induced α-helices on each terminus of the peptide. The function of conRl-B was examined by measuring its inhibition of NMDA/Gly-mediated current through NMDAR ion channels in mouse cortical neurons. The conRl-B displays high inhibitory selectivity for subclasses of NMDARs that contain the functionally important GluN2B subunit. Replacement of Hyp10 with N8Q results in a Mg2+-complexed end-to-end α-helix, accompanied by attenuation of NMDAR inhibitory activity. However, replacement of Hyp10 with Pro10 allowed the resulting peptide to retain its inhibitory property but diminished its GluN2B specificity. Thus, these modified amino acids, in specific peptide backbones, play critical roles in their subunit-selective inhibition of NMDAR ion channels, a finding that can be employed to design NMDAR antagonists that function at ion channels of distinct NMDAR subclasses. Conantokins are ∼20-amino acid peptides present in predatory marine snail venoms that function as allosteric antagonists of ion channels of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). These peptides possess a high percentage of post-/co-translationally modified amino acids, particularly γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla). Appropriately spaced Gla residues allow binding of functional divalent cations, which induces end-to-end α-helices in many conantokins. A smaller number of these peptides additionally contain 4-hydroxyproline (Hyp). Hyp should prevent adoption of the metal ion-induced full α-helix, with unknown functional consequences.

However, obtaining tumor tissue for mutation analysis is challenging. Here, we aimed to detect serum peptides/proteins associated with EGFR gene mutation status, and test whether a classification algorithm based on serum proteomic profiling could be developed to analyze EGFR gene mutation status to aid therapeutic decision-making.Serum collected from 223 stage IIIB or IV NSCLC patients with known EGFR gene mutation status in their tumors prior to therapy was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and ClinProTools software. Differences in serum peptides/proteins between patients with EGFR gene TKI-sensitive mutations and wild-type EGFR genes were detected in a training group of 100 patients; based on this analysis, a serum proteomic classification algorithm was developed to classify EGFR gene mutation status and tested in an independent validation group of 123 patients. The correlation between EGFR gene mutation status, as identified with the serum proteomic classifier and response to EGFR-TKIs was analyzed.Nine peptide/protein peaks were significantly different between NSCLC patients with EGFR gene TKI-sensitive mutations and wild-type EGFR genes in the training group. A genetic algorithm model consisting of five peptides/proteins (m/z 4092.4, 4585.05, 1365.1, 4643.49 and 4438.43) was developed from the training group to separate patients with EGFR gene TKI-sensitive mutations and wild-type EGFR genes. The classifier exhibited a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 77.5% in the validation group. In the 81 patients from the validation group treated with EGFR-TKIs, 28 (59.6%) of 47 patients whose matched samples were labeled as ""mutant"" by the classifier and 3 (8.8%) of 34 patients whose matched samples were labeled as ""wild"" achieved an objective response (p<0.0001). Patients whose matched samples were labeled as ""mutant"" by the classifier had a significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) than patients whose matched samples were labeled as ""wild"" (p=0.001).Peptides/proteins related to EGFR gene mutation status were found in the serum. Classification of EGFR gene mutation status using the serum proteomic classifier established in the present study in patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC is feasible and may predict tumor response to EGFR-TKIs."
https://openalex.org/W564088590,"Temporal information in a signal can be partitioned into temporal envelope (E) and fine structure (FS). Fine structure is important for lexical tone perception for normal-hearing (NH) listeners, and listeners with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) have an impaired ability to use FS in lexical tone perception due to the reduced frequency resolution. The present study was aimed to assess which of the acoustic aspects (E or FS) played a more important role in lexical tone perception in subjects with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) and to determine whether it was the deficit in temporal resolution or frequency resolution that might lead to more detrimental effects on FS processing in pitch perception. Fifty-eight native Mandarin Chinese-speaking subjects (27 with ANSD, 16 with SNHL, and 15 with NH) were assessed for (1) their ability to recognize lexical tones using acoustic E or FS cues with the ""auditory chimera"" technique, (2) temporal resolution as measured with temporal gap detection (TGD) threshold, and (3) frequency resolution as measured with the Q(10dB) values of the psychophysical tuning curves. Overall, 26.5%, 60.2%, and 92.1% of lexical tone responses were consistent with FS cues for tone perception for listeners with ANSD, SNHL, and NH, respectively. The mean TGD threshold was significantly higher for listeners with ANSD (11.9 ms) than for SNHL (4.0 ms; p < 0.001) and NH (3.9 ms; p < 0.001) listeners, with no significant difference between SNHL and NH listeners. In contrast, the mean Q(10dB) for listeners with SNHL (1.8 ± 0.4) was significantly lower than that for ANSD (3.5 ± 1.0; p < 0.001) and NH (3.4 ± 0.9; p < 0.001) listeners, with no significant difference between ANSD and NH listeners. These results suggest that reduced temporal resolution, as opposed to reduced frequency selectivity, in ANSD subjects leads to greater degradation of FS processing for pitch perception."
https://openalex.org/W1494367344,"This study aimed to establish a normal range for ankle systolic blood pressure (SBP).A total of 948 subjects who had normal brachial SBP (90-139 mmHg) at investigation were enrolled. Supine BP of four limbs was simultaneously measured using four automatic BP measurement devices. The ankle-arm difference (An-a) on SBP of both sides was calculated. Two methods were used for establishing normal range of ankle SBP: the 99% method was decided on the 99% reference range of actual ankle BP, and the An-a method was the sum of An-a and the low or up limits of normal arm SBP (90-139 mmHg).Whether in the right or left side, the ankle SBP was significantly higher than the arm SBP (right: 137.1 ± 16.9 vs 119.7 ± 11.4 mmHg, P<0.05). Based on the 99% method, the normal range of ankle SBP was 94~181 mmHg for the total population, 84~166 mmHg for the young (18-44 y), 107~176 mmHg for the middle-aged(45-59 y) and 113~179 mmHg for the elderly (≥ 60 y) group. As the An-a on SBP was 13 mmHg in the young group and 20 mmHg in both middle-aged and elderly groups, the normal range of ankle SBP on the An-a method was 103-153 mmHg for young and 110-160 mmHg for middle-elderly subjects.A primary reference for normal ankle SBP was suggested as 100-165 mmHg in the young and 110-170 mmHg in the middle-elderly subjects."
https://openalex.org/W581854306,"Uncoordinated 51-like kinase 2 (ULK2), a member of the serine/threonine kinase family, plays an essential role in the regulation of autophagy in mammalian cells. Given the role of autophagy in normal cellular homeostasis and in multiple diseases, improved mechanistic insight into this process may result in the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we present evidence that ULK2 associates with karyopherin beta 2 (Kapβ2) for its transportation into the nucleus. We identify a potential PY-NLS motif ((774)gpgfgssppGaeaapslRyvPY(795)) in the S/P space domain of ULK2, which is similar to the consensus PY-NLS motif (R/K/H)X(2-5)PY. Using a pull-down approach, we observe that ULK2 interacts physically with Kapβ2 both in vitro and in vivo. Confocal microscopy confirmed the co-localization of ULK2 and Kapβ2. Localization of ULK2 to the nuclear region was disrupted by mutations in the putative Kapβ2-binding motif (P794A). Furthermore, in transient transfection assays, the presence of the Kapβ2 binding site mutant (the cytoplasmic localization form) was associated with a substantial increase in autophagy activity (but a decrease in the in vitro serine-phosphorylation) compared with the wild type ULK2. Mutational analysis showed that the phosphorylation on the Ser1027 residue of ULK2 by Protein Kinase A (PKA) is the regulatory point for its functional dissociation from Atg13 and FIP 200, nuclear localization, and autophagy. Taken together, our observations indicate that Kapβ2 interacts with ULK2 through ULK2's putative PY-NLS motif, and facilitates transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, depending on its Ser1027 residue phosphorylation by PKA, thereby reducing autophagic activity."
