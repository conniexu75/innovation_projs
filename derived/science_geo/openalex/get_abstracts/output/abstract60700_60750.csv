Hot springs provide nearly ideal ecosystems for such study, since they are natural environments of great antiquity and relative constancy, where organisms have evolved to meet the environmental challenges of high temperatures. Even from our present limited knowledge, we can draw a number of conclusions."

https://openalex.org/W2029289609,"Experiments with transferred stearate layers were performed to determine the location of fracture planes in frozen ice-lipid systems. Bilayers and multilayers of carbon-14-labeled stearate were frozen in contact with an aqueous phase and then fractured. The distribution of radioactivity on both sides of the fracture showed that the stearate layers were cleaved apart predominantly in the plane of their hydrocarbon tails. Because bilayers split in this manner, it was possible to measure time-dependent exchange of label between the layers. Exchange occurred with a half-time of 50 minutes in the presence of calcium and 25 minutes in the absence of calcium. Since stearate bilayers and multilayers are models of hydrophobically stabilized structures, the strong influence of their hydrophobic region on the fracture plane provides an explanation of how the freeze-etch technique of electron microscopy can expose inner, hydrophobic faces of cell membranes."

https://openalex.org/W2008559976,Skin isografts from mice that were immunologically tolerant to allogeneic tissue had the ability to immunize isogeneic recipients against subsequent skin allografts. The immunizing isografts showed no gross signs of rejection themselves and appeared to be only the vehicles for transplantation antigen. It seems likely that allogeneic leukocytes derived from the spleen and bone marrow cells used to confer tolerance were contained in the skin of the tolerant mice and were transferred by the skin isografts in sufficient numbers to stimulate transplantation immunity.

https://openalex.org/W1509533940,"An analytical study was made of the concentric lamellar organelles (CLO) isolated from rabbit lung. These subcellular structures, which are normally located in the type II cells of mammalian lungs, were purified by flotation using a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. Electron microscopy of the isolated CLO revealed many intact structures about 1 µm in diameter with densely packed trilaminar membranes having, also, a granular core and an outer limiting membrane. The CLO contained a preponderance of polar lipids, mostly as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, with trace amounts of neutral lipid. A phospholipid to protein ratio of approximately 12:1, was repeatedly obtained and served as a criterion for organelle purification. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the detergent-solubilized CLO revealed a prominent staining band migrating with albumin. These structures had numerous hydrolases similar to those observed in lysosomes. High specific activities were observed for such enzymes as acid phosphatase, aryl sulfatase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Multiple forms of the latter enzyme were observed in zonal electrophoresis studies. Purification of the CLO resulted in a 20- to 40-fold increase in specific activity over homogenates for most of the hydrolases. Cathepsin D, acid DNase, acid RNase and neuraminidase, other lysosome-associated hydrolases, were not detected in the CLO fraction. It is suggested from these and other studies that CLO are secreted to the acellular lining of lung where they contribute surfactant phospholipids, and possibly, functional hydrolases. The lung CLO also appear to have many properties in common with those subcellular structures associated with certain human genetic lipidoses."

In addition, all three drugs produced an increase in the percentages of small fetuses per litter, of resorptions, and of fetal mortality."
https://openalex.org/W1976880873,"DURING a survey of babies born with meningomyelocele or hydrocephalus, one hundred mothers of such children provided histories of the relevant pregnancy. Among other things they were questioned by one of us (I. G.) as to the drugs which they had taken. The same information was obtained from a matched control group of one hundred mothers recently delivered of healthy babies. Data obtained from the mothers about drugs during pregnancy were checked with the medical advisers. As part of the survey the mothers were asked how their pregnancy was diagnosed. Nineteen mothers in the survey group and four of the control mothers reported having received oral tablets for the diagnosis of pregnancy (Table 1). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to any other drugs taken in the first trimester. The average interval between conception and test was 5.6 weeks in the survey group, and 6.2 weeks in the control group."

https://openalex.org/W2017115420,"THE transmission of rabies by bats was first reported in 1921 (ref. 1). Vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus murinus) have been found to be an important carrier of sylvatic rabies in South America2, and they have been known to shed the virus in their saliva for long periods of time without apparent illness3. Since 1953, when the first rabies isolate from bats in the United States was made from a yellow bat (Dasypterus floridanus) in Florida, there have been more than five hundred isolates from bats in at least thirty-six States4. A survey of the literature has failed to reveal reports of rabies in bats in south-east Asia, and publications of the World Health Organization5,6 state that surveys of bat rabies in Asia have been consistently negative. The same statement about bat rabies in Europe, however, was refuted by Pitzschke7, who isolated rabies virus from a wide-winged bat (Epitescus serotinus) in Thuringia, Germany. The high prevalence of rabies in Thailand and the dense bat population prompted us to investigate the disease in bats in this area."

https://openalex.org/W2057234687,Subcellular antigens obtained from donor spleen and kidney were administered to pregnant rabbits treated with hyaluronidase. Partial immunological tolerance to the donor was thus induced in the fetuses during the adaptive phase. The duration of tolerance was proportional to the total dose of antigen administered to the mother. Maternal sensitization to the offspring was noted in all rabbits giving birth to partially tolerant progeny.

https://openalex.org/W2024991384,"IN a series of experiments in which the effects of centrally acting drugs on the adaptation of the critical flicker frequency (CFF) to intermittent light of varying frequency was investigated, a consistent placebo effect was noted, namely a fall in mean CFF1–3. This had not been described by other workers investigating the effects of drugs and placebo on mean CFF alone, and it was therefore possibly due to the method used. The method used involved exposing subjects for periods of 1 min to an intermittent light of 25 or 50 c/s, before measuring ascending and descending thresholds of CFF3. To investigate this further, the CFF was measured in six subjects at 0, 1.5 and 3 h on 3 consecutive days, beginning at 9 a.m., about 1.5 h after a light breakfast. The subjects abstained from tea, coffee and smoking during the experimental period. On one day, ascending and descending thresholds were measured without previous adaptation, while on the others, subjects were exposed for 1 min to intermittent light at 25 or 50 c/s before the thresholds were measured. The method of measurement was the same as that previously described3 except that the light source was viewed through an artificial pupil 2 mm in diameter and was placed at the focal point of a lens which delivered parallel light to the eye. This procedure eliminated any effect of changes in pupil size of the subject. An interval of 1 min elapsed between each determination."

Investigators are agreed, however, that it has no demonstrable in vitro antiviral activity and evaporation into the air does not protect mice against experimental influenza virus infection2. It has been pointed out that a negative result in experimental animals does not mean that the material is negative in man3. A further trial has therefore been conducted among members of the staff of the Post Office Branch of the Treasury Medical Service."
