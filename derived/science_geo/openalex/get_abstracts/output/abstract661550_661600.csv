https://openalex.org/W3093148868,"The microscopic environment inside a metazoan organism is highly crowded. Whether individual cells can tailor their behavior to the limited space remains unclear. In this study, we found that cells measure the degree of spatial confinement by using their largest and stiffest organelle, the nucleus. Cell confinement below a resting nucleus size deforms the nucleus, which expands and stretches its envelope. This activates signaling to the actomyosin cortex via nuclear envelope stretch-sensitive proteins, up-regulating cell contractility. We established that the tailored contractile response constitutes a nuclear ruler–based signaling pathway involved in migratory cell behaviors. Cells rely on the nuclear ruler to modulate the motive force that enables their passage through restrictive pores in complex three-dimensional environments, a process relevant to cancer cell invasion, immune responses, and embryonic development."

We used metabolomics on blood from artery, coronary sinus, and femoral vein in 110 patients with or without heart failure to quantify the uptake and release of 277 metabolites, including all major nutrients, by the human heart and leg. The heart primarily consumed fatty acids and, unexpectedly, little glucose; secreted glutamine and other nitrogen-rich amino acids, indicating active protein breakdown, at a rate ~10 times that of the leg; and released intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, balancing anaplerosis from amino acid breakdown. Both heart and leg consumed ketones, glutamate, and acetate in direct proportionality to circulating levels, indicating that availability is a key driver for consumption of these substrates. The failing heart consumed more ketones and lactate and had higher rates of proteolysis. These data provide a comprehensive and quantitative picture of human cardiac fuel use."
https://openalex.org/W3093010709,"Lipid droplets (LDs) are the major lipid storage organelles of eukaryotic cells and a source of nutrients for intracellular pathogens. We demonstrate that mammalian LDs are endowed with a protein-mediated antimicrobial capacity, which is up-regulated by danger signals. In response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), multiple host defense proteins, including interferon-inducible guanosine triphosphatases and the antimicrobial cathelicidin, assemble into complex clusters on LDs. LPS additionally promotes the physical and functional uncoupling of LDs from mitochondria, reducing fatty acid metabolism while increasing LD-bacterial contacts. Thus, LDs actively participate in mammalian innate immunity at two levels: They are both cell-autonomous organelles that organize and use immune proteins to kill intracellular pathogens as well as central players in the local and systemic metabolic adaptation to infection."
https://openalex.org/W3093204259,"The lubrication of hydrogels arises from fluid or solvated surface phases. By contrast, the lubricity of articular cartilage, a complex biohydrogel, has been at least partially attributed to nonfluid, lipid-exposing boundary layers. We emulated this behavior in synthetic hydrogels by incorporating trace lipid concentrations to create a molecularly thin, lipid-based boundary layer that renews continuously. We observed a 80% to 99.3% reduction in friction and wear relative to the lipid-free gel, over a wide range of conditions. This effect persists when the gels are dried and then rehydrated. Our approach may provide a method for sustained, extreme lubrication of hydrogels in applications from tissue engineering to clinical diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W3093251690,"Governments around the globe are responding to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–related economic crisis with unprecedented economic recovery packages (1), which at the time of writing surpassed USD 12 trillion. Several influential voices, including the United Nations (UN) secretary-general, heads of state, companies, investors, and central banks, have called for post–COVID-19 economic recovery efforts to be used to catalyze the necessary longer-term transformation toward a more sustainable and resilient society. Here we shine a light on the opportunity for these investments to support a green recovery by inventorying and classifying the latest information on governments' fiscal stimulus plans (1) and comparing the size of these measures to estimates of low-carbon energy investment needs compatible with the 2015 UN Paris Agreement. We show that low-carbon investments to put the world on an ambitious track toward net zero carbon dioxide emissions by mid-century are dwarfed by currently announced COVID-19 stimulus funds. But marked differences across countries and regions at differing stages of development emphasize the role that international support and global partnership must play to create conditions that enable a global climate-positive recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3093404578,"The potent HIV-1 capsid inhibitor GS-6207 is an investigational principal component of long-acting antiretroviral therapy. We found that GS-6207 inhibits HIV-1 by stabilizing and thereby preventing functional disassembly of the capsid shell in infected cells. X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments revealed that GS-6207 tightly binds two adjoining capsid subunits and promotes distal intra- and inter-hexamer interactions that stabilize the curved capsid lattice. In addition, GS-6207 interferes with capsid binding to the cellular HIV-1 cofactors Nup153 and CPSF6 that mediate viral nuclear import and direct integration into gene-rich regions of chromatin. These findings elucidate structural insights into the multimodal, potent antiviral activity of GS-6207 and provide a means for rationally developing second-generation therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3093183764,"In metazoan tissues, cells decide their fates by sensing positional information provided by specialized morphogen proteins. To explore what features are sufficient for positional encoding, we asked whether arbitrary molecules (e.g., green fluorescent protein or mCherry) could be converted into synthetic morphogens. Synthetic morphogens expressed from a localized source formed a gradient when trapped by surface-anchoring proteins, and they could be sensed by synthetic receptors. Despite their simplicity, these morphogen systems yielded patterns reminiscent of those observed in vivo. Gradients could be reshaped by altering anchor density or by providing a source of competing inhibitor. Gradient interpretation could be altered by adding feedback loops or morphogen cascades to receiver cell response circuits. Orthogonal cell-cell communication systems provide insight into morphogen evolution and a platform for engineering tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3092802742,"Seasonal influenza affects millions of people across the United States each year. African Americans and Hispanics have significantly lower vaccination rates, and large-scale campaigns have had difficulty increasing vaccination among these two groups. This study assessed the feasibility of delivering a flu vaccination promotion campaign using influencers, and examined shifts in social norms regarding flu vaccine acceptability after a social media micro influencer campaign. Influencers were asked to choose from vetted messages and create their own original content promoting flu vaccination, which was posted to their social media pages. Content was intentionally unbranded to ensure that it aligned with the look and feel of their pages. Cross-sectional pre- and post-campaign surveys were conducted within regions that received the campaign and control regions to examine potential campaign impact. Digital metrics assessed campaign exposure. Overall, 117 influencers generated 69,495 engagements. Results from the region that received the campaign showed significant increases in positive beliefs about the flu vaccine, and significant decreases in negative community attitudes toward the vaccine. This study suggests that flu campaigns using a ground-up rather than top-down approach can feasibly reach at-risk groups with lower vaccination rates, and shows the potentials of using an influencer-based model to communicate information about flu vaccination on a large scale."
https://openalex.org/W3092666089,"Morphogen gradients provide positional information during development. To uncover the minimal requirements for morphogen gradient formation, we have engineered a synthetic morphogen in Drosophila wing primordia. We show that an inert protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP), can form a detectable diffusion-based gradient in the presence of surface-associated anti-GFP nanobodies, which modulate the gradient by trapping the ligand and limiting leakage from the tissue. We next fused anti-GFP nanobodies to the receptors of Dpp, a natural morphogen, to render them responsive to extracellular GFP. In the presence of these engineered receptors, GFP could replace Dpp to organize patterning and growth in vivo. Concomitant expression of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored nonsignaling receptors further improved patterning, to near-wild-type quality. Theoretical arguments suggest that GPI anchorage could be important for these receptors to expand the gradient length scale while at the same time reducing leakage."
https://openalex.org/W3101353611,"Photoionization is one of the fundamental light-matter interaction processes in which the absorption of a photon launches the escape of an electron. The time scale of the process poses many open questions. Experiments found time delays in the attosecond ($10^{-18}$ s) domain between electron ejection from different orbitals, electronic bands, or in different directions. Here, we demonstrate that across a molecular orbital the electron is not launched at the same time. The birth time rather depends on the travel time of the photon across the molecule, which is 247 zeptoseconds ($10^{-21}$ s) for the average bond length of H$_2$. Using an electron interferometric technique, we resolve this birth time delay between electron emission from the two centers of the hydrogen molecule."
https://openalex.org/W3092966872,"Epigenetic alteration is one of the hallmarks of colorectal cancer (CRC). Many driver genes are regulated by DNA methylation in CRC. However, the role of DNA methylation regulating lncRNAs remain elusive. Here, we identify that SNHG11 (small nucleolar RNA host gene 11) is upregulated by promotor hypomethylation in CRC and is associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. SNHG11 can promote CRC cell migration and metastasis under hypoxia. Interestingly, the DNA-binding motif of SNHG11 is similar to that of HIF-1α. In addition, SNHG11-associated genes are enriched with members of the HIF-1 signaling pathway in CRC. Mechanistically, SNHG11 binds to the pVHLrecognition sites on HIF-1α, thus blocking the interaction of pVHL with HIF-1α and preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, SNHG11 upregulates the expression of HIF-1α target genes, i.e., AK4, ENO1, HK2, and Twist1. Notably, SNHG11 can bind to the HRE sites in the promoter of these genes and increase their transcription. In summary, these results identify a SNHG11/ HIF-1α axis that plays a pivotal role in tumor invasion and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3093412637,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) couples nutrient sufficiency to cell growth. mTORC1 is activated by exogenously acquired amino acids sensed through the GATOR–Rag guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) pathway, or by amino acids derived through lysosomal degradation of protein by a poorly defined mechanism. Here, we revealed that amino acids derived from the degradation of protein (acquired through oncogenic Ras-driven macropinocytosis) activate mTORC1 by a Rag GTPase–independent mechanism. mTORC1 stimulation through this pathway required the HOPS complex and was negatively regulated by activation of the GATOR-Rag GTPase pathway. Therefore, distinct but functionally coordinated pathways control mTORC1 activity on late endocytic organelles in response to distinct sources of amino acids."

Here, we report the synthesis and structural and spectroscopic characterization of a stable Fe(VI) complex ( 3 ) prepared by facile one-electron oxidation of an Fe(V) bis(imido) ( 2 ). Single-crystal x-ray diffraction of 2 and 3 revealed four-coordinate Fe centers with an unusual “seesaw” geometry. 57 Fe Mössbauer, x-ray photoelectron, x-ray absorption, and electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies, supported by electronic structure calculations, support a low-spin ( S = 1/2) d 3 Fe(V) configuration in 2 and a diamagnetic ( S = 0) d 2 Fe(VI) configuration in 3 . Their shared seesaw geometry is electronically dictated by a balance of Fe-imido σ- and π-bonding interactions."
https://openalex.org/W3093356285,"Although sophisticated upper- and lower-limb prostheses have been developed, amputees cannot control them intuitively nor perceive sensations from them. These deficiencies result in serious issues, including risk of falls, decreased mobility, heart fatigue during walking, and lower functionality while grasping. Moreover, the prostheses are not perceived by the users as part of their own body (low embodiment), which increases cognitive burden during use or device abandonment. An ideal man-machine interface should enable effortless bidirectional communication between the user and the prosthesis. Neural prostheses that provide bidirectional interfacing with the residual nervous system exploit the persistence of the central and peripheral neural pathways devoted to motor control and sensing (1). A combination of neurotechnologies recently achieved previously unseen capabilities of prosthesis actuation and sensory restoration, but several hurdles need to be overcome before widespread use of these devices."

https://openalex.org/W3092747035,"Mushroom-forming fungi are complex multicellular organisms that form the basis of a large industry, yet, our understanding of the mechanisms of mushroom development and its responses to various stresses remains limited. The winter mushroom (Flammulina filiformis) is cultivated at a large commercial scale in East Asia and is a species with a preference for low temperatures. This study investigated fruiting body development in F. filiformis by comparing transcriptomes of 4 developmental stages, and compared the developmental genes to a 200-genome dataset to identify conserved genes involved in fruiting body development, and examined the response of heat sensitive and -resistant strains to heat stress. Our data revealed widely conserved genes involved in primordium development of F. filiformis, many of which originated before the emergence of the Agaricomycetes, indicating co-option for complex multicellularity during evolution. We also revealed several notable fruiting-specific genes, including the genes with conserved stipe-specific expression patterns and the others which related to sexual development, water absorption, basidium formation and sporulation, among others. Comparative analysis revealed that heat stress induced more genes in the heat resistant strain (M1) than in the heat sensitive one (XR). Of particular importance are the hsp70, hsp90 and fes1 genes, which may facilitate the adjustment to heat stress in the early stages of fruiting body development. These data highlighted novel genes involved in complex multicellular development in fungi and aid further studies on gene function and efforts to improve the productivity and heat tolerance in mushroom-forming fungi."
https://openalex.org/W3092865023,"Species of the genus Flavivirus are widespread in Brazil and are a major public health concern. The country's largest city, São Paulo, is in a highly urbanized area with a few forest fragments which are commonly used for recreation. These can be considered to present a potential risk of flavivirus transmission to humans as they are home simultaneously to vertebrate hosts and mosquitoes that are potential flavivirus vectors. The aim of this study was to conduct flavivirus surveillance in field-collected mosquitoes in the Capivari-Monos Environmental Protection Area (EPA) and identify the flavivirus species by sequence analysis in flavivirus IFA-positive pools. Monthly mosquito collections were carried out from March 2016 to April 2017 with CO2-baited CDC light traps. Specimens were identified morphologically and grouped in pools of up to 10 individuals according to their taxonomic category. A total of 260 pools of non-engorged females were inoculated into C6/36 cell culture, and the cell suspensions were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) after the incubation period. IFA-positive pools were tested by qRT-PCR with genus-specific primers targeting the flavivirus NS5 gene to confirm IFA-positive results and sequenced to identify the species. Anopheles cruzii (19.5%) and Wyeomyia confusa (15.3%) were the most frequent vector species collected. IFA was positive for flaviviruses in 2.3% (6/260) of the sample pools. This was confirmed by qRT-PCR in five pools (83.3%). All five flavivirus-positive pools were successfully sequenced and the species identified. DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) was detected in Culex spp. and Culex vaxus pools, while ZIKV was identified in An. cruzii, Limatus durhamii and Wy. confusa pools. To the best of our knowledge, detection of flavivirus species of medical importance has never previously been reported in these species of wild-caught mosquitoes. The finding of DENV-2 and ZIKV circulating in wild mosquitoes suggests the existence of an enzootic cycle in the area. In-depth studies of DENV-2 and ZIKV, including investigation of mosquito infection, vector competence and infection in sylvatic hosts, are needed to shed light on the transmission dynamics of these important viruses and the potential risk of future outbreaks of DENV-2 and ZIKV infections in the region."
https://openalex.org/W3092777995,"Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with speech and swallowing difficulties likely due to pathology in widespread brain and nervous system regions. In post-mortem studies of PD, pathology has been reported in pharyngeal and laryngeal nerves and muscles. However, it is unknown whether PD is associated with neuromuscular changes in the tongue. Prior work in a rat model of PD (Pink1-/-) showed oromotor and swallowing deficits in the premanifest stage which suggested sensorimotor impairments of these functions. The present study tested the hypothesis that Pink1-/- rats show altered tongue function coinciding with neuromuscular differences within tongue muscles compared to wildtype (WT). Male Pink1-/- and WT rats underwent behavioral tongue function assays at 4 and 6 months of age (n = 7–8 rats per group), which are time points early in the disease. At 6 months, genioglossus (GG) and styloglossus (SG) muscles were analyzed for myosin heavy chain isoforms (MyHC), α-synuclein levels, myofiber size, centrally nucleated myofibers, and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) innervation. Pink1-/- showed greater tongue press force variability, and greater tongue press forces and rates as compared to WT. Additionally, Pink1-/- showed relative increases of MyHC 2a in SG, but typical MyHC profiles in GG. Western blots revealed Pink1-/- had more α-synuclein protein than WT in GG, but not in SG. There were no differences between Pink1-/- and WT in myofiber size, centrally-nucleated myofibers, or NMJ innervation. α-synuclein protein was observed in nerves, NMJ, and vessels in both genotypes. Findings at these early disease stages suggest small changes or no changes in several peripheral biological measures, and intact motor innervation of tongue muscles. Future work should evaluate these measures at later disease stages to determine when robust pathological peripheral change contributes to functional change, and what CNS deficits cause behavioral changes. Understanding how PD affects central and peripheral mechanisms will help determine therapy targets for speech and swallowing disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3092920940,"To “put oneself in the place of other road users” may improve understanding of the global traffic situation. It should be useful enabling drivers to anticipate and detect obstacles in time to prevent accidents to other road users, especially those most vulnerable. We created a pioneering Hazard Perception and Prediction test to explore this skill in different road users (pedestrians, cyclists and drivers), with videos recorded in naturalistic scenarios: walking, riding a bicycle and driving a car. There were 79 participants (30 pedestrians, 14 cyclists, 13 novice drivers and 22 experienced drivers). Sixty videos of hazardous traffic situations were presented, divided into 2 blocks of 30 videos each: 10 walking, 10 riding a bicycle, 10 driving a car. In each situation presented, we evaluated the performance of the participants carrying out the task of predicting the hazard and estimating the risk. In the second block, after they had carried out the task, we gave them feedback on their performance and let them see the whole video (i.e., checking what happened next). The results showed that the holistic test had acceptable psychometric properties (Cronbach’s alpha = .846). The test was able to discriminate between the different conditions manipulated: a) between traffic hazards recorded from different perspectives: walking, riding a bicycle and driving a car; b) between participants with different user profiles: pedestrians, cyclists and drivers; c) between the two test blocks: the first evaluation only and the second combining evaluation with this complex intervention. We found modal bias effects in both Hazard Perception and Prediction; and in Risk Estimation."
https://openalex.org/W3092981469,"As cattle movement data in the United States are scarce due to the absence of mandatory traceability programs, previous epidemic models for U.S. cattle production systems heavily rely on contact rates estimated based on expert opinions and survey data. These models are often based on static networks and ignore the sequence of movement, possibly overestimating the epidemic sizes. In this research, we adapt and employ an agent-based model that simulates beef cattle production and transportation in southwest Kansas to analyze the between-premises transmission of a highly contagious disease, foot-and-mouth disease. First, we assess the impact of truck contamination on the disease transmission with the truck agent following an independent clean-infected-clean cycle. Second, we add an information-sharing functionality such that producers/packers can trace back and forward their trade records to inform their trade partners during outbreaks. Scenario analysis results show that including indirect contact routes between premises via truck movements can significantly increase the amplitude of disease spread, compared with equivalent scenarios that only consider animal movement. Mitigation strategies informed by information sharing can effectively mitigate epidemics, highlighting the benefit of promoting information sharing in the cattle industry. In addition, we identify salient characteristics that must be considered when designing an information-sharing strategy, including the number of days to trace back and forward in the trade records and the role of different cattle supply chain stakeholders. Sensitivity analysis results show that epidemic sizes are sensitive to variations in parameters of the contamination period for a truck or a loading/unloading area of premises, and indirect contact transmission probability and future studies can focus on a more accurate estimation of these parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3092871565,"Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the marginal and internal gaps in 3D-printed interim crowns made from digital models of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) conversion data. Materials and methods Sixteen polyvinylsiloxane impressions were taken from patients for single crown restorations and were scanned using CBCT. The scanning data were converted to positive Standard Triangulation Language (STL) files using custom-developed software. The fabricated stone models were scanned with an intraoral optical scanner (IOS) to compare the surface accuracy with the STL data obtained by CBCT. The converted STL files were utilized to fabricate interim crowns with a photopolymer using a digital light-processing 3D printer. The replica method was used to analyze the accuracy. The marginal and internal gaps in the replica specimen of each interim crown were measured with a digital microscope. The Friedman test and Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon-signed rank test) were conducted to compare the measurements of the marginal and internal gaps with a 95% level of confidence. Results The root-mean-square values of the CBCT and IOS ranged from 41.00 to 126.60 μm, and the mean was 60.12 μm. The mean values of the marginal, internal, and total gaps were 132.96 (±139.23) μm, 137.86 (±103.09) μm, and 135.68 (±120.30) μm, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the marginal or internal gaps between the mesiodistal and buccolingual surfaces, but the marginal area (132.96 μm) and occlusal area (255.88 μm) had significant mean differences. Conclusion The marginal gap of the fabricated interim crowns based on CBCT STL data was within the acceptable range of clinical success. Through ongoing developments of high-resolution CBCT and the digital model conversion technique, CBCT might be an alternative method to acquire digital models for interim crown fabrication."
https://openalex.org/W3093292644,"Background Estimating the morbidity of a population is strategic for health systems to improve healthcare. In recent years administrative databases have been increasingly used to predict health outcomes. In 1992, Von Korff proposed a Chronic Disease Score (CDS) to predict 1-year mortality by only using drug prescription data. Because pharmacotherapy underwent many changes over the last 3 decades, the original version of the CDS has limitations. The aim of this paper is to report on the development of the modified version of the CDS. Methods The modified CDS (M-CDS) was developed using 33 variables (from drug prescriptions within two-year before 01/01/2018) to predict one-year mortality in Bologna residents aged ≥50 years. The population was split into training and testing sets for internal validation. Score weights were estimated in the training set using Cox regression model with LASSO procedure for variables selection. The external validation was carried out on the Imola population. The predictive ability of M-CDS was assessed using ROC analysis and compared with that of the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), that is based on hospital data only, and of the Multisource Comorbidity Score (MCS), which uses hospital and pharmaceutical data. Results The predictive ability of M-CDS was similar in the training and testing sets (AUC 95% CI: training [0.760–0.770] vs. testing [0.750–0.772]) and in the external population (Imola AUC 95% CI [0.756–0.781]). M-CDS was significantly better than CCI (M-CDS AUC = 0.761, 95% CI [0.750–0.772] vs. CCI-AUC = 0.696, 95% CI [0.681–0.711]). No significant difference was found between M-CDS and MCS (MCS AUC = 0.762, 95% CI [0.749–0.775]). Conclusions M-CDS, using only drug prescriptions, has a better performance than the CCI score in predicting 1-year mortality, and is not inferior to the multisource comorbidity score. M-CDS can be used for population risk stratification, for risk-adjustment in association studies and to predict the individual risk of death."
https://openalex.org/W3093309943,"Regional differences and regulatory mechanisms of vegetation productivity response to changing environmental conditions constitute a core issue in macroecological researches. To verify the main limiting factors of different macrosystems [temperature-limited Tibetan Plateau (TP), precipitation-limited Mongolian Plateau (MP), and nutrient-limited Loess Plateau (LP)], we conducted a comparative survey of the east-west grassland transects on the three plateaus and explored the factors limiting regional productivity and their underlying mechanisms. The results showed that aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of LP (109.10 ± 16.76 g m−2 yr−1) was significantly higher than that of MP (66.71 ± 11.11 g m−2 yr−1) and TP (57.02 ± 10.59 g m−2 yr−1). The response rate of ANPP with environmental changes was different among different plateaus, being closely related to the main limiting factors. On MP, this was precipitation, on LP it was temperature and nutrients, and on TP, it was non-specific, reflecting restriction by the extremely low temperature. After autocorrelation screening of environmental factors, different regions exhibited different productivity response mechanisms. MP was mainly influenced by temperature and precipitation, LP was influenced by temperature and nutrient, and TP was influenced by nutrient, reflecting the modifying effect of the main limiting factors. The effect of each regional environment on ANPP was 72.56% on average and only 27.18% after simple regional integration. The regional model could optimize the simulation error of the integrated model, and the relative deviations in MP, LP, and TP were reduced by 31.76%, 17.22%, and 2.23%, respectively. These findings indicate that the grasslands on the three plateaus may have different or even the opposite mechanisms to control productivity."
https://openalex.org/W3092942462,"Background Healthcare providers’ (HCPs) recommendations for the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine are likely to increase the vaccination uptake. However, little is known about Ghanaian HCPs’ general practices regarding HPV vaccination. We used Multi-Theory Model (MTM) constructs (i.e. participatory dialogue, behavioral confidence, environment, social and emotional transformation) to examine Ghanaian HCPs’ attitudes towards HPV vaccination and their vaccination recommendation practices. Methods We conducted three, 60-minute focus group discussions (FGDs) with HCP in the second-largest government hospital in Ghana. Sixteen semi-structured open-ended questions based on MTM constructs were used to guide the FGDs. We explored HCPs’ general knowledge about HPV, vaccination recommendation behavior, physical environment, and socio-cultural factors associated with the HPV vaccination. Data from the FGDs were transcribed and thematically coded using NVivo software. Results The sample of (n = 29) HCPs consisting of males (n = 15) and females (n = 14) between the ages of 29 and 42 years participated in the FGDs. Our analyses showed that HCPs (a) rarely offered HPV vaccination recommendations, (b) showed varied understanding about who should be vaccinated regarding age eligibility, gender, and infection status. Perceived barriers to HPV vaccination include (a) low urgency for vaccination education due to competing priorities such as malaria and HIV/AIDS; (b) lack of data on HPV vaccination; (c) lack of awareness about the vaccine safety and efficacy; (c) lack of HPV vaccine accessibility and (d) stigma, misconceptions and religious objections. HCPs expressed that their motivation for counseling their clients about HPV vaccination would be increased by having more knowledge about the vaccine’s efficacy and safety, and the involvement of the parents, chiefs, churches, and opinion leaders in the vaccination programs. Conclusion The study’s findings underscore the need for a comprehensive HPV vaccination education for HCPs in Ghana. Future HPV vaccination education programs should include information about the efficacy of the vaccine and effective vaccination messages to help mitigate HPV vaccine-related stigma."
https://openalex.org/W3092033807,"The ability of skeletal muscle to regenerate declines significantly with aging. The expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), a critical component of the hypoxia signaling pathway, was less abundant in skeletal muscle of old (23-25 months old) mice. This loss of ARNT was associated with decreased levels of Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) and impaired regenerative response to injury in comparison to young (2-3 months old) mice. Knockdown of ARNT in a primary muscle cell line impaired differentiation in vitro. Skeletal muscle-specific ARNT deletion in young mice resulted in decreased levels of whole muscle N1ICD and limited muscle regeneration. Administration of a systemic hypoxia pathway activator (ML228), which simulates the actions of ARNT, rescued skeletal muscle regeneration in both old and ARNT-deleted mice. These results suggest that the loss of ARNT in skeletal muscle is partially responsible for diminished myogenic potential in aging and activation of hypoxia signaling holds promise for rescuing regenerative activity in old muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3092951497,"Mutualisms, or reciprocally beneficial interspecific interactions, constitute the foundation of many ecological communities and agricultural systems. Mutualisms come in different forms, from pairwise interactions to extremely diverse communities, and they are continually challenged with exploitation by nonmutualistic community members (exploiters). Thus, understanding how mutualisms persist remains an essential question in ecology. Theory suggests that high species richness and functional redundancy could promote mutualism persistence in complex mutualistic communities. Using a yeast system ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), we experimentally show that communities with the greatest mutualist richness and functional redundancy are nearly two times more likely to survive exploitation than are simple communities. Persistence increased because diverse communities were better able to mitigate the negative effects of competition with exploiters. Thus, large mutualistic networks may be inherently buffered from exploitation."
https://openalex.org/W3093459192,"Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) guidance for specific institutional audiences to limit community spread. Audiences include: business, clinical, public health, education, community, and state/local government. The swift, severe, and global nature of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to systematically obtain a national view of how larger institutions of higher education adopted NPI guidance at the onset of the pandemic. Method An original database of COVID-19-related university NPI policy changes was compiled. Survey team members manually combed university websites and official statements capturing implementation decisions and dates for five NPI variables from 575 U.S. universities, across 50 states and the District of Columbia, during March of 2020. The universities included in this study were selected from the Department of Education Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which provides a set of university explanatory variables. Using IPEDS as the basis for the organizational data allows consistent mapping to event-time and institutional characteristic variables including public health announcements, geospatial, census, and political affiliation. Results The dataset enables event-time analysis and offers a variety of variables to support institutional level study and identification of underlying biases like educational attainment. A descriptive analysis of the dataset reveals that there was substantial heterogeneity in the decisions that were made and the timing of these decisions as they temporally related to key state, national, and global emergency announcements. The WHO pandemic declaration coincided with the largest number of university decisions to implement NPIs. Conclusion This study provides descriptive observations and produced an original dataset that will be useful for future research focused on drivers and trends of COVID-19 NPIs for U.S. Universities. This preliminary analysis suggests COVID-19 university decisions appeared to be made largely at the university level, leading to major variations in the nature and timing of the responses both between and within states, which requires further study."

Cortisol plays a significant role in pathophysiology of MDD. Depression can alter serum cortisol level. However, the change in serum cortisol level and its association with depressive symptom severity and improvement among patients with MDD is not well studied. Objective To outline change in serum cortisol levels and its association with severity and improvement of depressive symptoms in newly diagnosed patients with MDD. Method Hospital based longitudinal study was conducted among 34 newly diagnosed patients who met DSM-V criteria of MDD. Venous blood sample was performed twice; pre- and post- 8 weeks of treatment. Serum cortisol concentration was measured using an extracted radioimmunoassay. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) was used to rate depression at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. Paired t-test was done to look the mean difference of serum cortisol level and HAM-D, before and after treatment. Pearson correlation was done to look the association between serum cortisol levels, HAM-D scores and, sociodemographic and clinical factors. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results There is no significant difference in cortisol concentrations at baseline and end line (t (33) = 2.02, p = 0.052). However, there is significant difference in HAM-D total score (t (33) = 5.67, p<0.001). Baseline and end line serum cortisol levels were significantly correlated (r = .561, p = .001). Monthly family income is correlated with baseline HAM-D total score (r = -0.373, p = .030). There is no significant relationship between baseline serum cortisol level and HAM-D score. There is also no significant relationship between end line serum cortisol level and HAM-D score. Conclusions The symptoms of MDD were reduced following treatment but there is no significant difference in serum cortisol levels. Baseline and end line serum cortisol levels were significantly correlated. We recommend further research based on large sample."
https://openalex.org/W3093004395,"The residual deformation of a goaf is studied to improve the foundation stability assessment for metro lines passing through the subsidence area of steeply inclined extra-thick coal seams. The variable mining influence propagation angle is introduced to describe the special form of the rock movement. Based on the modified parameters in the traditional probability integral model, a subsidence prediction model is established. Then, based on the idea of an equivalent mining thickness, Kelvin model is introduced to analyze the creep characteristics of the old goaf, and the dynamic prediction function of the residual subsidence is constructed to realize the dynamic analysis of the residual deformation. Moreover, a case study is used to evaluate the predictive effectiveness of the prediction model, and the results are compared with the monitoring data and numerical simulation results. The results show that the values with a relative error between the predicted value and measured value are in the range of ±7%, indicating that the prediction model based on the mining influence propagation angle is feasible. Thus, the residual deformation prediction model based on the mining influence propagation angle is considered to be suitable for predicting the subsidence of engineering projects crossing a goaf."

A total of 18629 unique peptides were identified in Uniprot, corresponding to 3,662 proteins. Among them, 383 and 409 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified from comparison between DR vs AL at day 7 and 42, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that membrane-related processes, post-transcriptional processes, spliceosome and reproduction related processes, were highlighted significantly. In addition, expression of proteins involved in pathways such as spliceosomes, oxidative phosphorylation, lysosomes, ubiquitination, and riboflavin metabolism was relatively higher during DR. A relatively large number of DEPs were found to participate in longevity and age-related disease pathways. We identified 20 proteins that were consistently regulated during DR and some of which are known to be involved in ageing, such as mTORC1, antioxidant, DNA damage repair and autophagy. In the integration analysis, we found 15 genes that were stably regulated by DR at both transcriptional as well as translational levels. Our results provided a useful dataset for further investigations on the mechanism of DR and aging."
https://openalex.org/W3093448997,"Mental illness often emerges during the formative years of adolescence and young adult development and interferes with the establishment of healthy educational, vocational, and social foundations. Despite the severity of symptoms and decline in functioning, the time between illness onset and receiving appropriate care can be lengthy. A method by which to objectively identify early signs of emerging psychiatric symptoms could improve early intervention strategies. We analyzed a total of 405,523 search queries from 105 individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD, N = 36), non-psychotic mood disorders (MD, N = 38) and healthy volunteers (HV, N = 31) utilizing one year's worth of data prior to the first psychiatric hospitalization. Across 52 weeks, we found significant differences in the timing (p<0.05) and frequency (p<0.001) of searches between individuals with SSD and MD compared to HV up to a year in advance of the first psychiatric hospitalization. We additionally identified significant linguistic differences in search content among the three groups including use of words related to sadness and perception, use of first and second person pronouns, and use of punctuation (all p<0.05). In the weeks before hospitalization, both participants with SSD and MD displayed significant shifts in search timing (p<0.05), and participants with SSD displayed significant shifts in search content (p<0.05). Our findings demonstrate promise for utilizing personal patterns of online search activity to inform clinical care."
https://openalex.org/W3093464400,"Background Few studies have focused on patients' emotional distress with end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and their main family caregivers. Methods Cross-sectional data about emotional, functional, and burden-related variables were collected from 85 patients with end-stage COPD and their 85 respective main family caregivers to determine the variables that could predict their emotional well-being. Descriptive analyses, comparison of means, hierarchical regression models, and comparative quali-quantitative analyses were carried out. Results Data show that the great majority of patients with COPD spend years with this diagnosis, and have been admitted to the hospital several times in advance stage of illness the previous year of the moment of end-of-life stage. Furthermore, only a tiny percentage of the patients were functionally independent in the advanced stage of illness. Conclusions The emotional distress and the burden of the family caregiver play an essential role in the distress of the patient, in conjunction with the patient's own functional independence and the time living with the disease, and comorbidity. On the other hand, variables of the patient, such as time since diagnosis, number of hospital admissions, comorbidity, functional dependence, and emotional distress, play an important role in the family caregiver's emotional distress and burden. Understanding how these variables are related is key to designing appropriate programs to reduce the emotional distress the patients with COPD at the end of life and their family caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W3092731166,"It has been documented that up to 22% of all soccer injuries are concussions. This is in part due to players purposely using their head to direct the ball during play. To provide a more complete understanding of head trauma in soccer athletes, this study characterized the effects of four soccer ball characteristics (size, inflation pressure, mass, velocity) on the resulting peak impact force as it relates to the potential for incurring neurophysiological changes. A total of six hundred trials were performed on size 4 and 5 soccer balls as well as a novel lightweight soccer ball. Impact force was measured with a force plate and ball velocity was determined using motion capture. These data were used, in conjunction with dimensional analysis to relate impact force to ball size, mass, velocity, and pressure. Reasonable reductions in allowable ball parameters resulted in a 19.7% decrease in peak impact force. Adjustments to ball parameters could reduce a high cumulative peak translational acceleration soccer athlete down into a previously defined safer low loading range. In addition, it was noted that water absorption by soccer balls can result in masses that substantially increase impact force and quickly surpass the NCAA weight limit for game play. Additional research is required to determine whether varying soccer ball characteristics will enable soccer players to avoid persistent neurophysiological deficits or what additional interventions may be necessary and the legal implications of these data are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3093206382,"There is a dearth of research to guide acute adolescent mental health inpatient care. Self-determination Theory provides evidence that meeting needs for relatedness, autonomy and competence is likely to increase wellbeing and intrinsic motivation. These needs may be able to be met in the inpatient environment.This qualitative study aimed to explore young people's experience of acute mental health inpatient care with particular attention to meeting of these three needs. Fifteen young people were interviewed. The importance of relatedness with staff, other young people and families was identified.Relatedness with staff and peers were valued parts of admission. Some young people describe enhanced relatedness with family. They described loss of autonomy as a negative experience but appreciated opportunities to be involved in choices around their care and having more freedom. Coming into hospital was associated with loss of competence but they described building competence during the admission. Engaging in activities was experienced positively and appeared to enhance meeting of all three needs. Meeting of the three needs was associated with an experience of increased safety.Engaging young people in activities with a focus on relatedness, autonomy and competence may have specific therapeutic potential. Autonomy, experience of competence and connection with staff may enhance safety more effectively than physical containment. Peer contact may have untapped therapeutic value we understand little of. This study supports the value of Self-determination Theory as a guide day to day inpatient care to meet the needs of adolescents for relatedness, autonomy and competence."
https://openalex.org/W3093256944,"Hepatitis is an important health problem worldwide. Novel molecular targets are in demand for detection and management of hepatitis. Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) has been delineated to participate in hepatic fibrosis and liver carcinogenesis. However, the relationship between hepatitis and HDGF remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of HDGF during hepatitis using concanavalin A (ConA)-induced hepatitis model. In cultured hepatocytes, ConA treatment-elicited HDGF upregulation at transcriptional level and promoted HDGF secretion while reducing intracellular HDGF protein level and cellular viability. Similarly, mice receiving ConA administration exhibited reduced hepatic HDGF expression and elevated circulating HDGF level, which was positively correlated with serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. By using HDGF knockout (KO) mice, it was found the ConA-evoked cell death was prominently alleviated in KO compared with control. Besides, it was delineated HDGF ablation conferred protection by suppressing the ConA-induced neutrophils recruitment in livers. Above all, the ConA-mediated activation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/interleukin-1β (IL-1β)/interleukin-6 (IL-6)/cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inflammatory signaling was significantly abrogated in KO mice. Treatment with recombinant HDGF (rHDGF) dose-dependently stimulated the expression of TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-6/COX-2 in hepatocytes, further supporting the pro-inflammatory function of HDGF. Finally, application of HDGF antibody not only attenuated the ConA-mediated inflammatory cascade in hepatocytes, but also ameliorated the ConA-induced hepatic necrosis and AST elevation in mice. In summary, HDGF participates in ConA-induced hepatitis via neutrophils recruitment and may constitute a therapeutic target for acute hepatitis."
https://openalex.org/W3093000858,"Infants born to HIV-infected mothers are more likely to be low birthweight (LBW) than other infants, a condition that is stigmatized in many settings worldwide, including sub-Saharan Africa. Few studies have characterized the social-cultural context and response to LBW stigma among mothers in sub-Saharan Africa or explored the views of women living with HIV (WLHIV) on the causes of LBW. We purposively sampled thirty postpartum WLHIV, who had given birth to either LBW or normal birthweight infants, from two tertiary hospitals in Accra, Ghana. Using semi-structured interviews, we explored women’s understanding of the etiology of LBW, and their experiences of caring for a LBW infant. Interviews were analyzed using interpretive phenomenology. Mothers assessed their babies' smallness based on the baby's size, not hospital-recorded birthweight. Several participants explained that severe depression and a loss of appetite, linked to stigma following an HIV diagnosis during pregnancy, contributed to infants being born LBW. Women with small babies also experienced stigma due to the newborns' ""undesirable"" physical features and other people's unfamiliarity with their size. Consequently, mothers experienced blame, reluctance showing the baby to others, and social gossip. As a result of this stigma, women reported self-isolation and depressive symptoms. These experiences were layered on the burden of healthcare and infant feeding costs for LBW infants. LBW stigma appeared to attenuate with increased infant weight gain. A few of the women also did not breastfeed because they thought their baby's small size indicated pediatric HIV infection. Among WLHIV in urban areas in Ghana, mother and LBW infants may experience LBW-related stigma. A multi-component intervention that includes reducing LBW incidence, treating antenatal depression, providing psychosocial support after a LBW birth, and increasing LBW infants’ weight gain are critically needed."

We conducted a cross-sectional study between January and December 2018, on indigenous women living nearby an urban center of the Midwest region of Brazil and determined the prevalence of TV. Factors associated with TV infection and a comparison of molecular and direct microscopy diagnoses were determined. 241 indigenous women aged above 18 years participated in the study. Cervical and vaginal brush samples were collected to diagnose TV through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Direct microscopy for detection of TV, and cellular changes was performed. A sociodemographic and behavioral questionnaire was applied at the beginning of the study. All the data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The result obtained showed that 27.8% [95% CI: 22.2–33.9] were positive for TV on PCR, while 7.41% [95% CI: 4.1–11] showed positive on direct microscopy. Direct microcopy also found 21 (8.71%) and 8 (3.31%) women infected with Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans, respectively. In addition, 10 women presented atypical squamous cells of unknown significance and 14 lesions suggestive of HPV. Single women, under the age of 30 and who do not use condoms, were found to have a greater chance of getting TV infection. The high prevalence TV found in this population is comparable to highly vulnerable populations, as prisoners, sex workers and women in regions with low socioeconomic levels, moreover, seems to be an underdiagnosis of this infection. Therefore, a routine test program, as well as a review of the diagnostic method used, is encouraged for proper management."

https://openalex.org/W3092775936,"Introduction Chagas Disease (CD) is endemic in many Latin-American countries, Bolivia in particular. It is now spreading in Italy as a host country for transcontinental migrants and becoming an emerging health problem. This anthropological action–research, as part of a wider medical project on Neglected Tropical Diseases, has the purpose of analyzing the sociocultural construction of CD and its representation in Bolivian people living in Rome as well as barriers, such as the stigma about the illness, to access the National Health Service for those potentially affected. Methods The ethnographic study was carried out from 2016 to 2018 by a medical anthropologist at the National Institute for Health, Migration and Poverty (INMP) on 72 Bolivian migrants (47 women and 25 men) living in Rome. The study was carried out through: a territorial mapping of Bolivian networks and communities aimed at recruiting people, participant observation, and application of semi-structured and unstructured interviews. The interviews were hold in Spanish and proposed to all participants before or during medical examination, or during events organized by the Bolivian community in Rome. The interview consisted of 16 items and covered four macro areas: personal and migration history, health status, access to the Italian National Health Service and knowledge about CD; plus 5 items for those who received a diagnosis of Chagas Disease in Italy. Results The sociocultural construction and the deep stigma about the illness built by participants and their families could hinder both diagnosis and treatment. Institutional barriers also contributed to reduce adherence to screening tests: often, opening hours of the outpatient clinic were incompatible with participants’ precarious employments. To guarantee participant’s access to public health services and their adherence to the diagnostic protocol, we implemented a profound revision of our cultural and institutional approach to them. Conclusions The analysis evidenced the limitations of the conventional approach applied by the Italian National Health Service to this migrant community, such as the absence of socio-cultural and linguistics competences that can help understanding patients’ perception and representation of the illness. The multidisciplinary approach instead—with clinicians using the ethnographic results to adjust their work to the participants’ needs—was a successful attempt to ensure therapeutic alliance."
https://openalex.org/W3093400848,"Background The suppression of viremia among persons with HIV (PWH) using antiretroviral therapy has been hypothesized to reduce HIV incidence at the population level. We investigated the impact of state level viral suppression among PWH in the United States on estimated HIV incidence between 2010 and 2015. Methods Viral suppression data and HIV incidence estimates from the National HIV Surveillance System were available from 29 states and the District of Columbia. We assumed a one year delay for viral suppression to impact incidence. Poisson regression models were used to calculate the estimated annual percent change (EAPC) in incidence rate. We employed a multivariable mixed-effects Poisson regression model to assess the effects of state level race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, percent men who have sex with men (MSM) and hepatitis C virus prevalence as a proxy for injection drug use on HIV incidence. Findings Fitted HIV incidence for 30 jurisdictions declined from 11.5 in 2010 to 10.0 per 100,000 population by 2015 corresponding with an EAPC of -2.67 (95% confidence interval [95%CI] -2.95, -2.38). Southern states experienced the highest estimated incidence by far throughout this period but upon adjustment for viral suppression and demographics there was a 36% lower incidence rate than Northeast states (adjusted rate ratio [aRR] 0.64; 95%CI 0.42, 0.99). For every 10 percentage point (pp) increase in viral suppression there was an adjusted 4% decline in HIV incidence rate in the subsequent year (aRR 0.96; 95%CI 0.93, 0.99). While controlling for viral suppression, HIV incidence rate increased by 42% (aRR 1.42 95%CI 1.31, 1.54) for every 5 pp increase in percent Black race and by 27% (aRR 1.27 95%CI 1.10, 1.48) for every 1 pp increase in percent MSM in states. Interpretation A decline in estimated HIV incidence from 2010 to 2015 was associated with increasing viral suppression in the United States. Race and sexual orientation were important HIV acquisition risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3093404482,"We previously reported that maternal cigarette smoke (CS) exposure resulted in impairment of central chemoreception and induced mitochondrial dysfunction in offspring parafacial respiratory group (pFRG), the kernel for mammalian central chemoreception. We also found that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) could attenuate maternal CS exposure-induced impairment of central chemoreception in the rat offspring in vivo. Mitochondrial ATP sensitive potassium (mitoKATP) channel has been reported to play a significant role in mitochondrial functions and protect against apoptosis in neurons. Thus, we hypothesize here that mitoKATP channel plays a role in the protective effects of H2S on neonatal central chemoreception in maternal CS-exposed rats. Our findings revealed that pretreatment with NaHS (donor of H2S, 22.4mM) reversed the central chemosensitivity decreased by maternal CS exposure, and also inhibited cell apoptosis in offspring pFRG, however, 5-HD (blocker of mitoKATP channels, 19mM) attenuated the protective effects of NaHS. In addition, NaHS declined pro-apoptotic proteins related to mitochondrial pathway apoptosis in CS rat offspring pFRG, such as Bax, Cytochrome C, caspase9 and caspase3. NaHS or 5-HD alone had no significant effect on above indexes. These results suggest that mitoKATP channels play an important role in the protective effect of H2S against impairment of central chemoreception via anti-apoptosis in pFRG of rat offspring exposed to maternal CS."
https://openalex.org/W3092710734,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is a ligand-dependent transcription regulator, containing two transactivation functional domains, AF-1 and AF-2. The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT), activate AF-1 preferentially rather than AF-2. However, it is unclear whether this specific function is related to the tissue-selective functionality of SERMs. Moreover, there is no information determining AF-1-dependent estrogenic-genes existing in tissues. We sought to identify AF-1-dependent estrogenic-genes using the AF-2 mutated knock-in (KI) mouse model, AF2ERKI. AF2ER is an AF-2 disrupted estradiol (E2)-insensitive mutant ERα, but AF-1-dependent transcription can be activated by the estrogen-antagonists, fulvestrant (ICI) and 4OHT. Gene profiling and ChIP-Seq analysis identified Klk1b21 as an ICI-inducible gene in AF2ERKI uterus. The regulatory activity was analyzed further using a cell-based reporter assay. The 5'-flanking 0.4k bp region of Klk1b21 gene responded as an ERα AF-1-dependent estrogen-responsive promoter. The 150 bp minimum ERα binding element (EBE) consists of three direct repeats. These three half-site sequences were essential for the ERα-dependent transactivation and were differentially recognized by E2 and 4OHT for the gene activation. This response was impaired when the minimum EBE was fused with a thymidine-kinase promoter but could be restored by fusion with the 100 bp minimum transcription initiation element (TIE) of Klk1b21, suggesting that the cooperative function of EBE and TIE is essential for mediating AF-1-dependent transactivation. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence that endogenous ERα AF-1 dominant estrogenic-genes exist in estrogen-responsive organs. Such findings will aid in understanding the mechanism of ERα-dependent tissue-selective activity of SERMs."

Aim This study aimed to determine the incidence and patient-related factors related to diabetes-related amputations amongst patients that were referred to the quaternary hospital between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2015. Methods A retrospective cohort study. Data were retrieved from the medical record for each diabetes patient that was managed at IALCH during the study period. The following variables were collected: sociodemographic parameters (age, gender, and ethnicity) and diabetes-related parameters (type of diabetes) and additional complications. Results Ninety-nine patients (0, 73%) of all diabetes patients managed were new diabetes-related lower-extremity amputations. There were statistically significant increased odds of female patients (OR: 1, 7) and patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes (OR: 1, 64) to have new diabetes-related amputations. Patients older than 60 years (OR: 1, 31); African patients (OR: 1, 35) patients with cardiovascular complications (OR: 1, 04) and patients with retinopathy (OR: 1, 48) were more likely to have diabetes-related amputations but not statistically significant. Conclusions A combination of primary preventive strategies, early detection and appropriate management of patients with diabetes and specific guidelines on the frequency, clinical and laboratory tests required for early diagnosis and referrals with early signs of diabetes-related complicationsat primary care level will assist in reducing the long term adverse outcomes including amputations."
https://openalex.org/W3092823516,"Objectives Adolescent wellbeing is critical to breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty and one in five of the world’s adolescents live in India. We explored predictors of learning skills and depression in Indian adolescents. Methods Data on adolescents aged 10–19y (three groups: 5,840 unmarried males, 8,953 unmarried females, 4,933 married females) were available from the state-representative Understanding the Lives of Adolescents and Young Adults survey in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for cluster sampling design and state fixed effects were used to examine factors (demographic, health/nutrition, social, and environmental) associated with three outcomes: reading proficiency, math proficiency, and depressive symptoms. Findings Learning skills were poor (28–61% lacked basic reading and math skills depending on adolescent group and outcome) and depression was common (8–26%). Better learning skills were predicted by greater household wealth (AOR 1.72–2.55 depending on group) and household head education (AOR 1.03–1.07 per year), being in school (AOR 4.19–18.65), parental support (AOR 1.11–1.39), having gender equal attitudes (AOR 1.56–2.67), number of food groups consumed at least weekly (unmarried females: AOR 1.11), and having an improved latrine (AOR 1.33–1.51). Poorer learning skills were predicted by family substance use (AOR 0.68–0.74), underweight (males: AOR 0.74), witnessing parental violence (AOR 0.66–0.78). Depressive symptoms were predicted by witnessing parental violence (AOR 1.51–1.92) and experiencing sexual abuse (AOR 2.30–6.16). Conclusion Factors across multiple life dimensions are associated with learning skills and depression in Indian adolescents. Adolescent-focused policies and programs should consider health/nutrition, social, and environmental aspects of life in vulnerable individuals."

https://openalex.org/W3093126574,"The influence of the health-related behavior of one spouse on that of the other is an important research question with public policy reprecussions. Yet, we are unaware of any previous study, which considered endogeneity problems between couples. Moreover, only a few studies considered ethnic origin differences among couples. Based on the 2016 wave of the Israeli longitudinal survey, we observe the cross-sectional correlation between the married couples' BMI, age, and accumulated wealth. The BMI (= [Formula: see text]) is a conventional measure of obesity, where BMI≥25 is considered overweight. Using a 3SLS methodology (in an effort to correct the endogeneity problem associated with BMI couples), the analysis tests the mutual obesity hypothesis among married couples. This hypothesis states that the BMI of the male influences that of a female and vice versa. Results indicate that on the one hand, a one-percent BMI increase among Arab Israeli males is associated with a projected 0.969 percent BMI increase among Arab Israeli females (p = 0.017); and in the case that an Arab Israeli male suffers from overweight, the projected probability of his Arab Israeli female counterpart to suffer from overweight as well rises (p = 0.050). On the other hand, one cannot reject the null hypothesis that projected BMI of the Arab Israeli male is unaffected by that of his Arab Israeli female counterpart (p = 0.907 and p = 0.853). As for the Jewish Israeli population, in the case that the 3SLS methodology is employed, so that the endogeneity problem among couples is considered, a one-percent BMI increase among Jewish Israeli females is associated with a projected 0.639 percent BMI increase among Jewish Israeli males (p = 0.091). Unlike Arab Israeli couples, no support is found to indicate the influence in the other direction, namely, the BMI of the male influences that of the female spouse. Research findings may thus be of relevance to public health and policy planners. Two limitations of this research lie in: 1) the self-reported BMI (which might be different from the measured BMI); and 2) missing confounders, such as regional dummies, which are not available in the dataset."

https://openalex.org/W3092717319,"Purpose 
In New Zealand, Pacific immigrants are among the fastest growing ethnic minorities but, as a group, they are also at most risk of not realising their literacy and educational aspirations critical for achieving their human potential and wellbeing. This may be due, in part, to a misalignment in the shared understanding of academic success between students, parents and their teachers within largely non-Pacific school environments. This study aims to report levels of agreement in child-mother, child-teacher, and mother-teacher perceptions of Pacific children’s academic performance at age 6 years.


Method 
A cohort of Pacific infants born during 2000 in Auckland, New Zealand, was followed as part of the Pacific Islands Families study. Maternal home interviews were conducted at 6-weeks and 6-years postpartum, together with separate child and teacher elicitations at 6-years. Pairwise agreement of academic performance responses was assessed using Cohen’s weighted κ statistic, along with symmetry and marginal homogeneity tests.


Results 
At 6-years, information was available for 1,001 children and their mothers, and teachers’ evaluations for 549 children. Negligible to slight agreements and significant asymmetry were found between the child-mother (κ = 0.03, 95% CI: -0.03, 0.09), child-teacher (κ = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.08), and mother-teacher (κ = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.11) pairwise assessments–with children and mothers more likely to rate Pacific children’s academic performance higher than their teachers. Significantly higher concordances with teacher assessments were found among mothers with post-secondary education, proficiency in English, and stronger alignment with New Zealand culture and for children who performed strongly on a standardised measure of performance relative to their peers.


Conclusion 
Strategies are needed to align Pacific students’ and parental perceptions with documented educational achievement outcomes and to facilitate more effective and timely feedback on achievement results and home-school communication. The importance of removing language, cultural and socio-economic barriers to achieving shared understanding of academic performance between teachers and families is highlighted."
