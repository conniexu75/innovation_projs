https://openalex.org/W1533084749,"Inhibition of ADP phosphorylation by both glycolysis and mitochondria in P388D1 cells exposed to H2O2 is described. Net glucose uptake and lactate production were inhibited by oxidant exposure (ED50 = 50-100 microM). Glycolysis was specifically inactivated at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step by three independent mechanisms: (a) direct inactivation of the intracellular enzyme (ED50 approximately equal to 100 microM); (b) reduction of the intracellular concentration and redox potential of its nicotinamide cofactors; and (c) a cytosolic pH shift further from the enzyme optima. Consistent with inhibition of glycolysis at the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step, a rise in the intracellular concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was observed. The calculated combined inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity could be reasonably correlated with the depression in glycolytic flux rate with the appropriate modeling. The steady-state contribution by mitochondria to the total intracellular ATP pool was indirectly determined by the use of various metabolic inhibitors and was found to rapidly decline following exposure to 300-800 microM H2O2. The inhibition of ADP phosphorylation appeared to be related more to the direct inhibition of the ATPase-synthase complex rather than to the diminished capacity of the respiratory chain for coupled electron transport. Both the estimated rates of ADP phosphorylation by glycolysis and mitochondria and the estimated rate of ATP hydrolysis by ongoing metabolism were utilized to model the approximate decline in intracellular ATP expected at 15-min exposure to various H2O2 concentrations. Theoretical calculations and the measured intracellular ATP status were in good agreement. Oxidant exposure for 15 min resulted in dose-dependent killing of the cells (ED50 = 500 microM), indicating a close correlation between H2O2-mediated loss of intracellular ATP and cell viability. The possible contribution of impaired energy homeostasis during oxidant-mediated injury to the process of cell dysfunction and death is discussed."

Healthy persons display only chance deviations beyond predicted ranges. Patients with neurological impairment, subtle cognitive dysfunctions, or psychiatric disorders (including dementia and primary depression) show a high incidence of abnormal values. The magnitude of the deviations increases with clinical severity. Different disorders are characterized by distinctive profiles of abnormal values of brain electrical features. Computerized differential classification of some of these disorders can be achieved with high accuracy. Such classification, providing objective corroboration of brain dysfunctions, may be a useful adjunct to psychiatric diagnosis, which relies primarily on subjective clinical impressions. These methods may provide independent criteria for diagnostic validity, evaluations of treatment efficacy, and more individualized therapy."

The successful implantation of a rifampin-resistant strain of the putative periodontal pathogen Bacteroides gingivalis into the periodontal microbiota of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) resulted in an increase in the systemic levels of antibody to the microorganism and rapid and significant bone loss."
https://openalex.org/W2110591420,"The structure of troponin C has been refined at 2A resolution to an R value of 0.172 using a total of 8,100 reflections. Troponin C has an unusual dumbbell shape with only the two C-domain high affinity sites III and IV occupied with metals, while the pair of N-domain low affinity sites I and II are devoid of metals. The coordination of the Ca2+ approaches seven with the last glutamic acid residue in each site forming an asymmetric bidentate ligand. The flanking helices in the metal-bound EF hands are in similar orientation (both 113 degrees) while in the apo sites they are more obtuse (134 and 149 degrees). The EF hands of holo sites III and IV are similar while the apo sites I and II are less similar (rms for backbone atoms, 0.78 and 1.44). The half-loops of the 12-residue holo and apo sites show better agreement than the full loops themselves, suggesting a hinge motion at the midpoint of the loops. The long central helix is stabilized by electrostatic interactions and salt bridges between charged side chains spaced at 3 or 4 residues along the helix. A cluster of water molecules encircle the long helix and hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyls. At the beginning of the B-helix, a water molecule is interposed at each of two consecutive backbone NH...OC hydrogen bonds. The terminal pair of helices A/D (apo) match with E/H (holo), and the internal pair of helices B/C (apo) match with F/G (holo). Thus, muscle contraction may be triggered by Ca2+ binding to loops I and II which results in a concerted rearrangement of residues in the loops, including the essential Gly at position 6 in each loop. This rearrangement than causes a reorientation of helices B and C along with the BC linker."
https://openalex.org/W1509611865,"Calsequestrin is a Ca2+-binding protein located intraluminally in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of striated muscle. In this study, Ca2+ binding to cardiac calsequestrin was assessed directly by equilibrium dialysis and correlated with effects on protein conformation and calsequestrin's ability to interact with other SR proteins. Cardiac calsequestrin bound 800-900 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein (35-40 mol of Ca2+/mol of calsequestrin). Associated with Ca2+ binding to cardiac calsequestrin was a loss in protein hydrophobicity, as revealed with use of absorbance difference spectroscopy, fluorescence emission spectroscopy, and photoaffinity labeling with the hydrophobic probe 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125]iodophenyl)diazirine. Ca2+ binding to cardiac calsequestrin also caused a large change in its hydrodynamic character, almost doubling the sedimentation coefficient. We observed that cardiac calsequestrin was very resistant to several proteases after binding Ca2+, consistent with a global effect of Ca2+ on protein conformation. Moreover, Ca2+ binding to cardiac calsequestrin completely prevented its interaction with several calsequestrin-binding proteins, which we identified in cardiac junctional SR vesicles for the first time. The principal calsequestrin-binding protein identified in junctional SR vesicles exhibited an apparent Mr of 26,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. This 26-kDa calsequestrin-binding protein was greatly reduced in free SR vesicles and absent from sarcolemmal vesicles and was different from phospholamban, an SR regulatory protein exhibiting a similar molecular weight. Our results suggest that the specific interaction of calsequestrin with this 26-kDa protein may be regulated by Ca2+ concentration in intact cardiac muscle, when the Ca2+ concentration inside the junctional SR falls to submillimolar levels during coupling of excitation to contraction."
https://openalex.org/W2073511157,"In a prospective cohort study of 265 laboratory and affiliated workers, one individual with no recognized risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was HIV-1 seropositive at the time of entry into the study. Molecular analyses of two HIV-1 isolates derived in two independent laboratories from a blood sample from this worker showed that the isolates were indistinguishable from a genotypic form of HIV-1 present in the H9/HTLV-IIIB cell line. Exposure to this strain of virus most probably occurred during work with concentrated virus or culture fluids from virus-producing cell lines under standard Biosafety Level 3 containment. Although no specific incident leading to this infection has been identified, undetected skin contact with virus culture supernatant might have occurred. This worker was the only one found to be positive among the subgroup of 99 workers who shared a work environment involving exposure to concentrated virus. The incidence rate of 0.48 per 100 person-years exposure indicates that prolonged laboratory exposure to concentrated virus is associated with some risk of HIV-1 infection, which is comparable to the risk for health care workers experiencing a needle stick exposure. While none of the ten workers with parenteral exposure to HIV-1 in this cohort became infected, a worker in another laboratory did seroconvert following an injury with a potentially contaminated needle. Strict Biosafety Level 3 containment and practices should be followed when working with concentrated HIV-1 preparations, and further refinement of the procedures may be necessary."

Forces used for imaging (10-8 newton) had no observable effect on the polymer strands. These results demonstrate that atomic force microscope images can be obtained for an organic system."
https://openalex.org/W1592428766,"Electrically permeabilized neutrophils were used to study the mechanism of activation of the respiratory burst by the chemotactic agent formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Permeabilization was assessed by flow cytometry, radioisotope trapping, and by the requirement for exogenous NADPH for oxygen consumption. A respiratory burst could be elicited by fMLP, phorbol ester, or diacylglycerol in permeabilized cells suspended in EGTA-buffered medium with 100 nM free Ca2+. The fMLP response persisted even in cells depleted of intracellular Ca2+ stores by pretreatment with ionomycin. Therefore, a change in cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) is not required for receptor-mediated stimulation of the respiratory burst. The responses induced by phorbol ester and diacylglycerol were largely inhibited by H7, a protein kinase C antagonist. In contrast, the stimulation of oxygen consumption by fMLP was unaffected by H7. These results suggest that a third signaling pathway, distinct from changes in [Ca2+]i and activation of protein kinase C, is involved in the response of neutrophils to chemoattractants."
https://openalex.org/W1970435533,"Establishment of a primary developmental axis generally is thought to involve rearrangements in the plasma membrane or cytoplasm of the egg. In this report the additional requirement for cell wall in polarization of Fucus zygotes was investigated. Protoplasts of fertilized eggs were tested for their ability to establish an axis in accordance with an orienting vector of unilateral light. The results demonstrate that cell wall is not required for axis formation. However, the orientation of the axis remains labile until new cell wall is synthesized. The presence of a cell wall is an absolute requirement for axis fixation."
https://openalex.org/W1534395160,"Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoproteins are apparently synthesized with a hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal peptide that is cleaved and replaced by a complex glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchor within 1 min of the completion of polypeptide synthesis. The rapidity of this carboxyl-terminal modification suggests the existence of a prefabricated core glycolipid that would be transferred en bloc to the variant surface glycoprotein polypeptide. We report the purification and chemical characterization of a glycolipid from T. brucei that has properties consistent with a role as a variant surface glycoprotein glycolipid donor. This candidate glycolipid precursor has been defined by thin-layer chromatography of extracts of trypanosomes metabolically labeled with radioactive myristic acid, ethanolamine, glucosamine, mannose, and phosphate and by enzymatic, chemical, and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis. Mild alkali released 100% of the myristic acid, and reaction with phospholipase A2 released 50%. Nitrous acid deamination generated dimyristylphosphatidylinositol, and periodate oxidation released phosphatidic acid. Treatment of purified glycolipid with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C released dimyristylglycerol and a water-soluble glycan that was sized on Bio-Gel P-4 columns. The candidate precursor contained mannose, myristic acid, phosphate, and ethanolamine with an unsubstituted amino group, but not galactose."

https://openalex.org/W2014598834,"The multiple copies of the human ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) are arranged as tandem repeat clusters that map to the middle of the short arms of chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22. Concerted evolution of the gene family is thought to be mediated by interchromosomal recombination between rDNA repeat units, but such events would also result in conservation of the sequences distal to the rDNA on these five pairs of chromosomes. To test this possibility, a DNA fragment spanning the junction between rDNA and distal flanking sequence has been cloned and characterized. Restriction maps, sequence data, and gene mapping studies demonstrate that (i) the rRNA genes are transcribed in a telomere-to-centromere direction, (ii) the 5â€² end of the cluster and the adjacent non-rDNA sequences are conserved on the five pairs of chromosomes, and (iii) the 5â€² end of the cluster is positioned about 3.7 kb upstream from the transcription initiation site of the first repeat unit. The data support a model of concerted evolution by interchromosomal recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1573788449,"The steady state levels of mitochondrial acyl-CoAs produced during the oxidation of pyruvate, alpha-ketoisovalerate, alpha-ketoisocaproate, and octanoate during state 3 and state 4 respiration by rat heart and liver mitochondria were determined. Addition of carnitine lowered the amounts of individual short-chain acyl-CoAs and increased CoASH in a manner that was both tissue- and substrate-dependent. The largest effects were on acetyl-CoA derived from pyruvate in heart mitochondria using either state 3 or state 4 oxidative conditions. Carnitine greatly reduced the amounts of propionyl-CoA derived from alpha-ketoisovalerate, while smaller effects were obtained on the branched-chain acyl-CoA levels, consistent with the latter acyl moieties being poorer substrates for carnitine acetyltransferase and also poorer substrates for the carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase. The levels of acetyl-CoA in heart and liver mitochondria oxidizing octanoate during state 3 respiration were lower than those obtained with pyruvate. The rate of acetylcarnitine efflux from heart mitochondria during state 3 (with pyruvate or octanoate as substrate, in the presence or absence of malate with 0.2 mM carnitine) shows a linear response to the acetyl-CoA/CoASH ratio generated in the absence of carnitine. This relationship is different for liver mitochondria. These data demonstrate that carnitine can modulate the aliphatic short-chain acyl-CoA/CoA ratio in heart and liver mitochondria and indicate that the degree of modulation varies with the aliphatic acyl moiety."

https://openalex.org/W1503697962,"Human erythrocyte protein 4.1 is phosphorylated in vivo by several protein kinases including protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent kinase. We have used cAMP-dependent kinase purified from red cells and protein kinase C purified from brain to test the effects of phosphorylation on band 4.1 function. In solution, each kinase catalyzed the incorporation of 1-4 mol of PO4/mol of band 4.1. Phosphorylation of band 4.1 by each kinase resulted in a significant (50-80%) reduction in the ability of band 4.1 to promote spectrin binding to F-actin. Direct measurement of spectrin-band 4.1 binding showed that phosphorylation by each kinase also caused dramatic reduction in this association. Phosphorylation of band 4.1 by each kinase for increasing time periods enabled us to demonstrate an approximately linear inverse relationship between PO4 incorporation into band 4.1 and spectrin binding. These results show that phosphorylation of band 4.1 by cAMP-dependent kinase and protein kinase C may be central to the regulation of red cell cytoskeletal organization and membrane mechanical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1954284565,"To systematically evaluate the contribution of each amino acid residue of the troponin I (TnI) inhibitory region (104-115), 14 synthetic analogs were synthesized by the solid-phase method. The analogs consisted of either single glycine or multiglycine replacements. The importance of the substituted amino acid(s) was determined from the extent of inhibition of the acto-S1 ATPase activity and the strength of binding to a troponin C (TnC) high pressure liquid chromatography affinity column of each synthetic analog. Every residue of the TnI sequence (104-115) is necessary to achieve maximum inhibition of the ATPase activity. However, the analogs quantitatively differed in the amount of inhibition induced. The TnI analogs bound less tightly to the TnC affinity column than the native synthetic peptide indicating that all residues in the TnI sequence contribute to the binding of TnC in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+. In the presence of Ca2+, there is a definite increase in the strength of the interaction between most analogs and TnC. This is accompanied with a shift toward a more specific interaction with the C terminus of the TnI inhibitory sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1481009887,"In a fully soluble system from resting human neutrophils, activation of the respiratory burst oxidase under defined conditions was found to follow first-order kinetics. The manner in which this first-order activation process varied with the concentrations of the individual components in the activating system suggested the following. 1) The respiratory burst oxidase occurs in two forms that can be distinguished by their Km values for NADPH. The low-affinity form contains one component (M) from the membrane and two components (S and C alpha) from the cytosol, while the high-affinity form contains an extra cytosolic component (C beta). 2) The active forms of the oxidase are generated in the following reactions: (formula; see text) where S is a stabilizing component and where M.S is an activated form of M.S that is capable of binding C alpha and C beta to produce the active oxidase species M.S.C alpha (the low-affinity form) and M.S.C alpha C beta (the high-affinity form). 3) SDS activates the oxidase by mediating the conversion of M.S to M.S."

https://openalex.org/W2068230766,"The high cumulative incidence of AIDS and the large percentage of AIDS patients with no identified risks in Belle Glade, Florida, were evaluated through case interviews and neighborhood-based seroepidemiologic studies. It was found that of 93 AIDS patients reported between July 1982 and 1 August 1987, 34 could be directly linked to at least one other AIDS patient or to a person with AIDS-related complex by sexual contact, sharing of needles during intravenous drug abuse (or both), or perinatal exposure; of 877 randomly selected adults, 28 had antibodies to HIV; no person over age 60 and none of 138 children aged 2 to 10 years had antibodies to HIV; no clustering of infected persons within households occurred, except in sex partners; and HIV-seropositive adults were more likely than HIV-seronegative adults to be from Haiti, have a lower income, report sex with intravenous drug abusers, and have a history of previous treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. The presence of antibodies to five arboviruses prevalent in South Florida or the Caribbean did not correlate significantly with HIV infection. The high cumulative rate of AIDS in Belle Glade appears to be the result of HIV transmission through sexual contact and intravenous drug abuse; the evidence does not suggest transmission of HIV through insects."
https://openalex.org/W1618720360,"Heparin (H) was previously shown to accelerate the inactivation of alpha-thrombin (T) by antithrombin III (AT) primarily by promoting the initial binding of thrombin and AT in a ternary T.AT.H complex intermediate without significantly influencing the subsequent product formation step (Olson, S. T., and Shore, J. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 14891-14895). In the present study, the protein-heparin interactions which contribute to the assembly of the ternary complex intermediate and their linkage were quantitated by equilibrium binding and stopped-flow kinetic studies at pH 7.4, I 0.3, 25 degrees C, using p-aminobenzamidine (P) as a fluorescence probe. Equilibrium binding studies of the AT.H and T.H binary complex interactions monitored by the 40% enhancement in AT fluorescence or the 16-18% quenching of thrombin-bound p-aminobenzamidine fluorescence, respectively, indicated a 100-fold greater affinity of AT for heparin (KAT,H 0.23 microM) as compared to thrombin for heparin (KT,H 35-42 microM). Consistent with this large difference in affinities, rapid kinetic studies indicated that assembly of the ternary complex occurred predominantly as a bimolecular association between the AT.H binary complex and free thrombin. Thus, under pseudo-first order conditions ([AT]o, [H]o much greater than [T]o much less than [P]o), the observed thrombin inactivation rate constant (kobs) exhibited a saturable dependence on [AT]o or [H]o when [H]o much less than KT,H, reflecting a KAT,H (0.25 microM) similar to that directly determined by equilibrium binding. Moreover, competitive inhibition of the reaction by T.H binary complexes was indicated from the hyperbolic decrease in kobs produced by heparin with either high or low affinity for AT or active-site blocked thrombin at concentrations comparable to KT,H. This behavior was consistent with values of KT,H (27-51 microM) similar to those determined directly from equilibrium binding measurements. Comparison of the affinities of the binary protein-heparin interactions with the affinity of thrombin for AT.H complex in the ternary complex measured previously, indicated that the affinity of either protein for heparin was enhanced about 10-fold by the prior binding of the other protein to heparin. This linkage of the protein-heparin interactions implies that the ternary complex will be assembled at thrombin, AT, and heparin concentrations considerably lower than those predicted from previous reaction models which fail to account for this linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1596802320,"An equilibrium isotope exchange technique was used to measure in an Artemia system the catalytic influence of elongation factor (EF) 1 beta gamma on the dissociation of GDP from the complex of elongation factor 1 alpha.[3H] GDP in the presence of an excess of free GDP. The kinetic data demonstrate that, in analogy to procaryotes, dissociation of GDP occurs via the formation of a transient ternary complex of EF-1 alpha.GDP.EF-1 beta gamma. The rate constants for the dissociation of GDP from EF-1 alpha.GDP and from the ternary complex EF-1 alpha.GDP.EF-1 beta gamma were found to be 0.7 x 10(-3) and greater than or equal to 0.7 s-1, respectively. The equilibrium association constants of GDP to EF-1 alpha.EF-1 beta gamma and of EF-1 beta gamma to EF-1 alpha.GDP were found to be 2.3 x 10(5) and 4.2 x 10(5) M-1, respectively. Judged from the known elongation rate in vivo and kinetic constants of nucleotide exchange, it was estimated that the recycling of EF-1 alpha may be a rate-controlling step in eucaryotic translation. As a model for GTP exchange, the formation of the ternary EF-1 alpha.guanylyl (beta gamma-methylene)diphosphonate.EF-1 beta gamma complex was also studied. It was observed that both an increase of the level of aminoacyl-tRNA and of temperature favored the dissociation of this complex, thereby enabling EF-1 beta gamma to recycle as a catalyst. This behavior would explain the frequent occurrence of a heavy form of elongation factor 1 in extracts of the eucaryotic cell."
https://openalex.org/W1528244732,"A lectin that can specifically bind to O-acetylsialic acids, found in glycoproteins and gangliosides, was purified to homogeneity from a crab Cancer antennarius (crab lectin) (Ravindranath, M. H., Higa, H. H., Cooper, E. L., and Paulson, J. C. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8850-8856; Correction (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 1983; Ravindranath, M. H., and Paulson, J. C. (1987) Methods Enzymol. 138, 520-527). We tested lectin binding to human melanoma cell lines to identify O-acetylsialylated gangliosides on the melanoma cell surface. The highest degree of binding of the crab lectin was demonstrated on a melanoma cell line, UCLASO-M25. To confirm that the binding was due to O-acetylsialic acid in the alkali-labile gangliosides, the gangliosides were isolated and purified from M25 cells and individually coated onto sheep asialoerythrocytes, which served as targets in an agglutination assay using the lectin. The crab lectin agglutinated the asialo-sheep erythrocytes coated with alkali-labile gangliosides, but the lectin failed to agglutinate the asialoerythrocytes coated with GM3, GD3, and base-treated gangliosides. Subsequently, the purified alkali-labile M25 ganglioside was base-treated and applied to TLC, and we found that it was converted to a slower migrating species identical to the disialolactosylceramide (GD3). These results indicate that O-acetyl GD3 expressed on the melanoma cell surface is recognized by the lectin. Because O-acetyl GD3 is not expressed on human normal tissues, we examined the capability of O-acetyl GD3 to induce immune responses in man. Sera from patients with melanoma were tested against M25 cells in an immuneadherence assay, and those positive to the M25 cell line were further tested for specificity to O-acetyl gangliosides. The presence of autoantibodies to O-acetyl-GD3 in melanoma sera was confirmed by blocking of the antigen sites on M25 cells by the lectin or preabsorption of the sera with erythrocytes bearing O-acetyl gangliosides. The data provide evidence that O-acetyl-GD3 may represent an important tumor marker for detection and treatment of human melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1819692671,"L-Gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, one of the microsomal flavin enzymes, catalyzes the last step of L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis in many animals; however, it is missing in scurvy-prone animals such as humans, primates, and guinea pigs. A cDNA clone for this enzyme was isolated by screening a rat liver cDNA expression library in lambda gt11 using antibody directed against the enzyme. The cDNA clone contained 2120 nucleotides and an open reading frame of 1320 nucleotides encoding 440 amino acids of the protein with a molecular weight of 50,605. The amino-terminal sequence (residues 1-33) of the enzyme isolated from rat liver completely coincided with the corresponding part of the deduced amino acid sequence. The identity of the cDNA clone was further confirmed by the agreement of the composition of the deduced amino acids with that determined by amino acid analysis of the enzyme. Hydropathy analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed several hydrophobic regions, suggesting that they anchor the protein into the microsomal membrane. The deduced amino acid sequence showed no obvious homology with the flavin-binding regions of other eight flavoenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1558146285,"In the course of a cell-cell interaction, 12-HETE (12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid), the arachidonic acid lipoxygenase product released from stimulated platelets, is metabolized by a cytochrome P-450 enzyme system in unstimulated neutrophils to 12,20-DiHETE (12,20-dihydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid). This report describes time-dependent formation of a new eicosanoid by unstimulated neutrophils exposed to 12-HETE, which is more polar than 12,20-DiHETE (reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography). Time course studies indicated that the precursor compound of this new eicosanoid was 12,20-DiHETE. This was determined by incubation of purified 12,20-DiHETE with neutrophils, which resulted in a progressive decrease in 12,20-DiHETE as formation of the polar metabolite increased. In the absence of neutrophils, 12,20-DiHETE was quantitatively unchanged. The new metabolite of 12,20-DiHETE was identified as 12-hydroxyeicosatetraen-1,20-dioic acid, based upon its UV spectrum, co-chromatography with a chemically synthesized standard in both high performance liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography systems, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Formation of 12-HETE-1,20-dioic acid was partially inhibited by 20-hydroxy-LTB4. This indicated that the neutrophil dehydrogenase responsible for further metabolism of 12,20-DiHETE may also be involved in conversion of 20-hydroxy-LTB4 to 20-carboxy-LTB4. The 12,20-DiHETE dehydrogenase enzyme system specifically requires NAD as cofactor and has subcellular components in both cytosolic and microsomal fractions which are synergistic in their activity. These results provide additional evidence for the occurrence of multicellular metabolic events during hemostasis, thrombosis, and the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1515670497,"The interaction of the neurotoxic pigment bilirubin with synaptosomal plasma membrane vesicles (SPMV) isolated from rat brain was investigated. The interaction seems to involve three steps: (a) a rapid formation of an electrostatic complex between bilirubin and polar lipid head groups; (b) a slow inclusion of the pigment into the hydrophobic core of the membrane; and (c) a SPMV-induced bilirubin aggregation, observed when membrane capacity for bilirubin is exceeded. The association constant of the initial complex increased markedly when pH was lowered below 7.4, particularly in SPMV isolated from newborn rats. A preferential binding of bilirubin to pure gangliosides and sphingomyelin was observed, thus suggesting a role for these lipids as first targets of the pigment in the synaptic membrane. The inclusion of bilirubin into the membranes was gradually enhanced when decreasing the pH or the age of the rats from which SPMV were isolated. In addition, membranes from 2-day-old rats have a higher capacity for bilirubin incorporation compared to those from adult rats. Experiments with reconstituted liposomes of varying protein and cholesterol contents suggest that the effect of age may be related to changes in synaptosomal membrane fluidity during development. Our results support the hypothesis that the interaction of bilirubin with the synaptic membrane plays an important role in the molecular mechanisms of bilirubin neurotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2404852962,"Ganglioside expression and tetanus toxin binding were studied in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12. Seven ganglioside species were readily detected in extracts of PC12 cells; two were identified as tri- and tetrasialogangliosides, which are common brain constituents but unusual components of neuronal cell lines. Carbohydrate composition, acid and enzyme hydrolyses, and mass spectral analysis revealed that the major species is GT 1b, a predominant mammalian brain ganglioside previously reported to support high affinity tetanus toxin binding (Rogers, T. B., and Snyder, S. H. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 2402-2407). Direct binding of 125I-tetanus toxin to PC12 gangliosides on TLC plates revealed selective binding to the tri- and tetrasialogangliosides. Radioiodinated toxin also bound with high affinity to intact PC12 cells or their isolated membranes. The binding affinity (Kd = 1.25 nM), density of receptors (Bmax = 238 pmol/mg of membrane protein), and dependence on pH, ionic strength, and temperature were similar to those previously reported for toxin binding to rat brain synaptic membranes. Differentiation of PC12 cells caused an increase in expression of the tri- and tetrasialogangliosides and a closely matched increase in tetanus toxin binding to cell membranes. These data provide evidence that complex gangliosides may act as tetanus toxin receptors, and demonstrate the utility of the PC12 cell line for studies of tetanus toxicity and complex ganglioside expression."
https://openalex.org/W1514454969,"One sulfhydryl group was modified per mol of native human gastric lipase after incubation at pH 8.0 with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) for 18 h or with 4,4'-dithiopyridine for 100 min. With both reagents a direct correlation was found between the modification of one sulfhydryl group and the loss of human gastric lipase activity. Incubation of human gastric lipase with a new hydrophobic sulfhydryl reagent dodecyldithio-5-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in 30-fold molar excess, at pH 3.0, 5.0, and 8.0, induced immediate and complete human gastric lipase inactivation. Unlike 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and 4,4'-dithiopyridine, dodecyldithio-5-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) almost instantaneously stopped the course of tributyrin hydrolysis by human gastric lipase. Human gastric lipase can thus be said to be a sulfhydryl enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1557248110,"Non-transferrin-bound iron is efficiently cleared from serum by the liver and may be primarily responsible for the hepatic damage seen in iron-overload states. We tested the hypothesis that transport of ionic iron is driven by the negative electrical potential difference across the liver cell membrane. Extraction of 55Fe-labeled ferrous iron (1 microM) from Krebs bicarbonate buffer by the perfused rat liver was continuously monitored as the transmembrane potential difference (measured using conventional microelectrodes) was altered over the physiologic range by isosmotic ion substitution. Resting membrane potential in Krebs bicarbonate buffer was -28 +/- 1 mV. Perfusion with 1 microM ferrous iron caused a reversible 3 +/- 1 mV depolarization, and higher concentrations of iron caused even greater depolarization. Conversely, depolarization of the liver cells consistently reduced iron extraction. Replacement of sodium with potassium (70 mM) or choline (131 mM) depolarized the hepatocytes to -15 and -20 mV and decreased iron extraction by 28 and 31%, respectively. Perfusion with bicarbonate-free solutions containing tricine buffer (10 mM) reduced the membrane potential to -23 mV and reduced iron extraction by 18%. In contrast, the high basal extraction of iron (91.1 +/- 1.4%) was not further increased by substitution of nitrate for chloride (-46 mV) or infusion of glucagon (-34 mV). All effects were reversible, suggesting that perfusion with 1 microM iron produced little toxicity. These findings are consistent with an electrogenic transport mechanism for uptake of non-transferrin-bound iron that is driven by the transmembrane potential difference."

R., II, and Watson, J. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10150-10156). Furthermore mevalonate carbon diversion appears to occur at the polyprenyl 1-pyrophosphate level. This report summarizes initial efforts to define the mevalonate carbon diversion pathway. We demonstrate that Kc cell extracts readily metabolize [14C]farnesyl 1-pyrophosphate and [14C]farnesol, via common intermediates, to identical 14C-products. Two of the major 14C-products were identified as trans,trans-3,7,11-trimethyl-2,6,10-dodecatrien-1,12-dioic acid and trans-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-decadien-1,10-dioic acid. Similar acids were also synthesized by supplemented rat liver extracts incubated with [14C]farnesol. We conclude that (a) mevalonate carbon diversion at the level of polyprenyl 1-pyrophosphate is a viable metabolic strategy, (b) polyprenols are oxidized to alpha,omega-prenyl dicarboxylic acids which are catabolized from the omega-terminus, and (c) this metabolic process is not limited to insect cells."
https://openalex.org/W1567418487,"The first committed enzyme in GDP-L-fucose formation from GDP-D-mannose is GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase, which forms GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose. The uncertain enzymatic steps beyond this point were examined in this study. Assays were developed for the epimerase and reductase activities which the putative pathway would predict. A protein was isolated exhibiting homogeneity by several criteria. This single protein, which forms GDP-L-fucose from GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose and NADH, appears to possess both epimerase and reductase capabilities and may be termed GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose-3,5-epimerase-4-reductase. Analysis on a molecular sieve column using fast protein liquid chromatography established a molecular weight of 63,100 for the native enzyme, whereas sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis established a subunit molecular weight of 31,500."
https://openalex.org/W1570808361,"Labeling by a hydrophobic photoactivatable reagent and limited proteolysis have been used to study conformational changes of diphtheria toxin related to its pH-dependent membrane insertion and translocation. TID (3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine) labels diphtheria toxin at pH 5 much more efficiently than at pH 7, both in the presence and absence of lipid vesicles. In the absence of membranes, the extent of labeling is greater and the pH dependence is stronger. As analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and by high pressure liquid chromatography, both the A- and B-subunits and most of the cyanogen bromide fragments of the toxin are labeled by TID at acid pH. The products of trypsin cleavage of diphtheria toxin at pH 5 are different from those seen at neutral pH. Trypsin-susceptible sites were identified by gel electrophoresis of the trypsin fragments, combined with electrophoresis and high pressure liquid chromatography of CNBr digests of trypsin-treated toxin. At neutral pH, the main sites of digestion are at the junction between the A- and B-fragments and near the NH2 terminus of the A-fragment. At pH 5.2, these sites are less efficiently cut, and new sites appear near the NH2 terminus of the B-fragment, in an amphipathic portion of the sequence. Thus, even in the absence of membranes, acid pH induces a significant conformational change in diphtheria toxin. This change involves burial of some previously accessible sites, exposure of previously inaccessible sites, and the formation of hydrophobic regions over an extensive portion of the polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W1551352684,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of aldehydes to acids through the formation of a covalent intermediate. It has been postulated that a cysteine residue could be acting as the active site nucleophilic group. Although N-ethylmaleimide was found to react with many cysteines it was possible by doing the reaction in the presence of chloral hydrate, a substrate analog which functions as a competitive inhibitor, to label cysteine at position 49 in the horse liver mitochondrial enzyme. The dehydrogenase activity was lost as the residue was modified, consistent with the possibility that the residue was an integral component of the active site of the enzyme. Cysteines at positions 162 and 369 also could be modified. It is suggested that cysteine 162 may function as part of a site capable of hydrolyzing nitrophenyl acetate. Details of the second site will appear in the accompanying paper (Tu, G. C., and Weiner, H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1218-1222). It appeared that the substrate-binding domain was in the N-terminal portion of the enzyme while the coenzyme binding domain was in the C-terminal portion. During this investigation 133 of the 500 residues of the horse liver enzyme were sequenced. These showed about 95% sequence identity with those of the human enzyme. Inasmuch as both beef and rat liver enzymes also share 95% identity with the human enzyme it can be expected that the results found with the horse liver enzyme can be applicable to all mammalian aldehyde dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W1566267517,"We have investigated the effect of oxidants on ligand recognition and internalization by the macrophage mannose receptor. Rat bone marrow macrophages were treated with increasing concentrations of H2O2 for 30 min at 37 degrees C. Fifty percent inhibition of ligand uptake was observed at 250 microM, with only 10% of control uptake remaining following exposure to 1 mM H2O2 for 30 min. Electron micrographic analysis of macrophages following H2O2 treatment showed no morphological alterations compared to untreated cells. Ligand uptake was also inhibited by the following H2O2 generating systems: menadione, xanthine/xanthine oxidase, glucose/glucose oxidase, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Inhibition could be blocked by catalase plus or minus superoxide dismutase. Treatment of macrophages at 4 degrees C with H2O2 had no effect on ligand binding, whereas treatment with H2O2 at 37 degrees C reduced binding to 15% of control levels and decreased the number of surface receptors to one-third of control cells. H2O2 treatment inhibited ligand degradation by macrophages, but did not prevent ligand movement from the surface to the interior of the cell. In addition, ligand delivery to lysosomes was blocked by oxidant treatment. These results suggest that treatment of macrophages with reagent H2O2 or H2O2-generating systems inhibits the normal ligand delivery and receptor recycling process involving the mannose receptor. Potential mechanisms might include receptor oxidation, alterations in ATP levels, or membrane lipid peroxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1589396736,"Abstract A reproducible, fairly narrow-sized population of rat lymph chylomicrons, approximately 100 nm, was isolated by centrifugation and combined with low levels of [1-13C]oleic acid for NMR studies. The carboxyl chemical shift was monitored as a function of aqueous pH to characterize the ionization behavior of the fatty acid in these particles. The titration curves were very similar to those for oleic acid in equivalent-sized emulsion particles composed of egg phosphatidylcholine and triolein. A simple partition-ionization model was fitted to the data to derive values for apparent ionization constant, expressed as pKapp, of 7.4-7.5 and the true surface to core partition coefficient of approximately 7 for oleic acid in chylomicrons. The fatty acid in chylomicrons thus appeared to be largely associated with the surface regions of these particles. Addition of bovine serum albumin to the samples showed that near physiologic pH much of the fatty acid was bound to the albumin at fatty acid to albumin-binding stoichiometries as high as 5.1 and with mass ratios of greater than 2 in favor of the lipid or lipoprotein particles. Lowering the pH of the medium shifted the distribution of fatty acid away from albumin so that at pH 5 with the emulsion, virtually all the fatty acid was associated with the lipid. The behavior observed under physiologic conditions is consistent with the rapid clearance and redistribution of fatty acid generated in these particles by lipolytic processes. However, under conditions of severe acidosis, hyperlipidemia, and hypoalbuminemia a significant portion of fatty acids might be retained in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants and affect subsequent metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1585435832,"Abstract Nucleotide sequence analysis of a cDNA clone shown to direct the synthesis in Escherichia coli of a pI 6.5 form of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) with an apparent molecular weight of 21,000 has clarified the allelic nature of the DHFR genes present in the Chinese hamster lung cell line DC-3F. By comparison with other cDNAs encoding different forms of DHFR produced by these cells or by antifolate-resistant sublines derived from them (Melera, P.W., Davide, J.P., Hession, C.A., and Scotto, K.W (1984) Mol. Cell. Biol. 4, 38-48) and with the use of transcription vectors to generate homogeneous populations of specific DHFR mRNAs for subsequent translation in vitro, we demonstrate that, with respect to the proteins they encode, these alleles differ only at amino acid position 95; a conversion of Asp----Asn at this position is solely responsible for the electrophoretic mobility and pI differences between the Mr 21,000 pI 6.5 and Mr 20,000 pI 6.7 forms of the enzyme. We also show that the conversion of Leu to Phe at position 22 of the Mr 21,000 pI 6.5 enzyme results in a mutant form whose catalytic activity is equal to or greater than normal, but whose IC50 for methotrexate is 85 microM. Additionally, the in vitro translation experiments show that the minor pI forms of DHFR known to exist in Chinese hamster lung cells are generated by a translational or post-translational modification step. Preliminary evidence suggests that this modification may result from an acetylation of the N terminus of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1650765914,"A Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant, AR45, was selected for amphotericin B resistance after treatment with the mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate. The mutant is a cholesterol auxotroph with a deficiency in cholesterol biosynthesis. Whole cell experiments demonstrate that the mutant accumulates the C30 sterols, lanosterol and dihydrolanosterol, under culture conditions which promote active sterol biosynthesis. Metabolic studies show that the C29 sterol demethylation product of lanosterol, but not lanosterol itself, is actively converted to end product cholesterol by whole cells as well as by microsomal preparations derived from the mutant. Detectable amounts of several cytochromes can be observed spectrally in the AR45 demonstrating that it is not a general heme-deficient mutant. Collectively, these results characterize the AR45 mutant cells as being lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase-deficient. The cell line should prove useful in studying regulation of the demethylase enzyme and the putative endogenous regulatory oxysterol. It should also be a useful tool in the molecular cloning and elucidation of genetic properties of the demethylase."

In addition to degradation products of leukotriene A4 (6-trans-leukotriene B4 and its 12-epimer and others), (5S,6R)-dihydroperoxy-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid was produced as a major product especially when the incubation was performed on ice rather than at room temperature. The amount of the (5S,6R)-dihydroperoxy acid was close to the total amount of leukotriene A4 degradation products. Under the anaerobic condition, production of the (5S,6R)-dihydroperoxy acid was markedly reduced. 5-Hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid could be a substrate of the enzyme and was transformed predominantly to a compound identified as (5S)-hydroxy-(6R)-hydroperoxy-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid at about 1-2% rate of arachidonate 5-oxygenation. These findings indicated that the purified 5-lipoxygenase exhibited a 6R-oxygenase activity with (5S)-hydroxy and (5S)-hydroperoxy acids as substrates. The 6R-oxygenase activity, like the leukotriene A synthase activity, was presumed to be an integral part of 5-lipoxygenase because it required calcium and ATP and was affected by selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1543846266,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase can catalyze the hydrolysis of esters such as p-nitrophenyl acetate as well as oxidize aldehydes to acids. It has not been proven unequivocally that the two reactions occur at the same active site. In the accompanying paper (Tu, G. C., and Weiner, H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1212-1217) evidence was presented which showed that cysteine at position 49 was at the active site for the dehydrogenase reaction. Evidence also was presented which showed that cysteine located at position 162 was susceptible to modification by N-ethylmaleimide. It was shown here that the two activities of the enzyme can be differently protected from inactivation by substrate analogs. Furthermore, aldehydes were found to be poor inhibitors against the esterase reaction while ester was a good inhibitor against the dehydrogenase reaction. In addition, it was possible to modify cysteine 49 with N-ethylmaleimide but not find inhibition of the esterase reactivity until cysteine 162 was modified. It appears that horse liver aldehyde dehydrogenase has two separate active sites per subunit. The data fit a model where ester can be hydrolyzed at both sites but that aldehyde oxidation occurred only at position 49."
https://openalex.org/W1510645277,"Mitogenic stimulation of sparse quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells with serum induces a transient reorganization of microtubules which may be necessary for generation or transduction of the mitogenic signal(s). Recently, several studies have shown that microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) modulate microtubule-mediated functions in vitro and in vivo. We have analyzed, by two-dimensional electrophoresis, the molecular changes in MAPs associated with microtubules in situ following cell activation. By as early as 15 min after addition of serum, several of the MAPs present in quiescent cells are lost from the assembled microtubule fraction while one additional MAP becomes evident. This new MAP is a phosphoprotein whose appearance is independent of protein synthesis. Four additional MAPs also become phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation is accompanied by a partial redistribution of MAPs into the unassembled soluble fraction. Stimulation of cells with purified platelet-derived growth factor or phorbol tumor promoter, a direct activator of protein kinase C, also induces phosphorylation of the same MAPs and DNA synthesis. These results demonstrate that activation of the protein kinase C pathway is sufficient to promote the phosphorylation of MAPs and mitogenesis. However, epidermal growth factor, which does not activate protein kinase C, also stimulates phosphorylation of MAPs and DNA replication. Furthermore, down-regulation of the protein kinase C pathway does not prevent these responses. We conclude that phosphorylation of MAPs and mitogenesis can proceed through protein kinase C-dependent and -independent pathways in 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1574834441,"Abstract The effects of varying extracellular pH on the rates of uptake of titratable anions by human erythrocytes under conditions of constant intracellular pH have been determined for a series of highly related anions, the phosphate analogs. These compounds are simply substituted phosphorus oxyacids, differing in the number and acidity of titratable protons: phosphate (HPO4(2-), pKa 6.8); phosphite (HPO3(2-), pKa 6.4); hypophosphite (H2PO2-); methylphosphonate ((CH3)PO3(2-), pKa 7.4); dimethylphosphinate ((CH3)2PO2-); fluorophosphate [PO3F2-, pKa 4.7); and thiophosphate (HSPO3(2-), pKa 5.5). Suspensions of intact, Cl(-)-loaded erythrocytes (intracellular pH, 7.2) were incubated at 37 degrees C in isotonic buffers (pH 4-8) containing 60 mM phosphate analog for specified time intervals, whereupon influx was halted by the addition of 1 mM 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS), an inhibitor of anion exchange. The intracellular anion concentrations were determined from 31P or 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectra from the erythrocyte suspensions. The influx rates for the titratable phosphate analogs exhibited bimodal pH dependence, reaching maximal levels at pH values that increased with increasing anion pK. This pH-dependent behavior is consistent with a transport channel that contains a titratable regulatory site which interacts with the translocated anion. Based upon the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, the probability that a titratable anion will have an electric charge of equal magnitude to that of the titratable carrier is highest at a pH value exactly midway between the pK of the regulatory site and that of the anion. The pH maxima observed for the phosphate analogs indicate a pK for this site of 5.5 at 37 degrees C. Intracellular pH changes associated with influx indicated that transport of the fast anion phosphite is largely in monoionized form. Intracellular pH changes associated with transport of slow anions were predominantly determined by partial ionic equilibrium effects and did not indicate the ionization state of the transported anion."
https://openalex.org/W1608719958,"The alpha- and beta-chains of hemoglobin (Hb) are methylated in intact erythrocytes and in cellular extracts by a protein D-aspartate methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) specific for D-aspartyl and L-isoaspartyl residues. During an 18-h incubation of intact erythrocytes with L-[methyl-3H]methionine, the subfraction of Hb molecules associated with the membrane becomes progressively enriched with methyl esters, reaching a specific activity 10-fold that of cytosolic Hb. The enhanced methylation of membrane Hb in intact cells appears not to result from its methylation at sites with inherently greater stability, since salt-extracted membrane Hb 3H-methyl esters and cytosolic Hb 3H-methyl esters are hydrolyzed at similar rates at pH 8.4 in vitro. Oxidative treatment of column-purified Hb with acetylphenylhydrazine produces an immediate 4-fold increase in its specific methyl-accepting activity coincident with the production of hemichrome forms known to possess a higher affinity for membrane binding sites. Together, the results suggest that the methyltransferase preferentially recognizes partially denatured Hb molecules which possess a higher affinity for membrane binding sites, similar to Hb forms observed in senescent erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1555730543,"The fluid-phase interaction between factor B and an activated form of C3 (C3b or C3(H2O)) is fundamental to the formation of the alternative complement pathway C3 convertase. The present study reports on the thermodynamic parameters that govern these interactions. The extrinsic fluorescent probe 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) and factor B were found to act as competitive ligands in binding to C3b. Thus, complex formation between C3b or C3(H2O) and factor B could be monitored by the quenching of C3b/C3(H2O)-dependent ANS fluorescence upon the addition of B. Under physiological conditions (0.5 mM Mg2+, 37 degrees C, mu = 0.15), the Ka governing the binding of C3b to B was 2.5 X 10(6) M-1, whereas the interaction of C3(H2O) with factor B was of 5-fold lower affinity. Both reactions were endothermic, with the van't Hoff enthalpy being approximately +16.0 kcal mol-1 in each case. Thus, a large positive entropy change provides the net driving force in these interactions. Although Ka increased at higher Mg2+ concentrations, this was not an enthalpy-mediated phenomenon. Taken together, these data are consistent with hydrophobic interactions being dominant in C3b.B or C3(H2O).B complex formation. The enhancement of complex formation by Mg2+ and concomitant increase in delta S suggests that the metal ion plays a role in increasing the number of hydrophobic contacts."
https://openalex.org/W1601051372,"The pH optimum of rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase is dependent on the structure of the cofactor employed and on the state of activation of the enzyme. The tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent activity of native phenylalanine hydroxylase has a pH optimum of about 8.5. In contrast, the 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin-dependent activity is highest at pH 7.0. Activation of phenylalanine hydroxylase either by preincubation with phenylalanine or by limited proteolysis results in a shift of the pH optimum of the tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent activity to pH 7.0. Activation of the enzyme has no effect on the optimal pH of the 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin-dependent activity. The different pH optimum of the tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent activity of native phenylalanine hydroxylase is due to a change in the properties of the enzyme when the pH is increased from pH 7 to 9.5. Phenylalanine hydroxylase at alkaline pH appears to be in an altered conformation that is very similar to that of the enzyme which has been activated by preincubation with phenylalanine as determined by changes in the intrinsic protein fluorescence spectrum of the enzyme. Furthermore, phenylalanine hydroxylase which has been preincubated at an alkaline pH in the absence of phenylalanine and subsequently assayed at pH 7.0 in the presence of phenylalanine shows an increase in tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent activity similar to that exhibited by the enzyme which has been activated by preincubation with phenylalanine at neutral pH. Activation of the enzyme also occurs when m-tyrosine or tryptophan replace phenylalanine in the assay mixture. The predominant cause of the increase in activity of the enzyme immediately following preincubation at alkaline pH appears to be the increase in the rate of activation by the amino acid substrate. However, in the absence of substrate activation, phenylalanine hydroxylase preincubated at alkaline pH displays an approximately 2-fold greater intrinsic activity than the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2145410167,"A vitamin B12-binding protein (haptocorrin) from chicken serum has been purified to homogeneity by photodissociative affinity chromatography and characterized by gel electrophoresis and UV-visible spectrophotometry of its aquocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, and cyanocobalamin complexes. The haptocorrin is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of about 70 kDa and a protein moiety of about 40 kDa. 31P NMR resonances of the haptocorrin-cobalamin complexes are relatively broad singlets (with or without proton decoupling) shifted downfield by 0.7-1.0 ppm from the position of the free cobalamin resonances. From the line width data, the relaxation of the phosphorus nucleus is found to be dominated by chemical shift anisotropy with a very minor (13%) component from dipolar interaction with the two nearest neighbor protons. The rotational correlation time of the haptocorrin at 25 degrees C is estimated to be 85 ns and the activation energy for rotational correlation 3.9 +/- 0.3 kcal mol-1. The downfield shift of the 31P resonances of cobalamins upon binding to the haptocorrin cannot be due to hydrogen bonding phosphodiester moiety or displacement of the axial base by a group on the protein. Calculations also show that the downfield shift is very unlikely to be due to dipolar deshielding of the phosphorus nucleus by the ring current of an aromatic residue of the protein. It is concluded that the downfield shift of the 31P resonance must be due to sterically induced changes in phosphodiester conformation which may, or may not, involve steric compression of the axial Co-N bond."
https://openalex.org/W1492621397,"The synthesis of the first iodinated juvenile hormone (JH) in enantiomerically enriched form is reported. This chiral compound, 12-iodo-JH I, has an iodine atom replacing a methyl group of the natural insect juvenile hormone, JH I, which is important in regulating morphogenesis and reproduction in the Lepidoptera. The unlabeled compound shows approximately 10% of the relative binding affinity for the larval hemolymph JH binding protein (JHBP) of Manduca sexta, which specifically binds natural 3H-10R,11S-JH I (labeled at 58 Ci/mmol) with a KD of 8 X 10(-8) M. It is also approximately one-tenth as biologically active as JH I in the black Manduca and epidermal commitment assays. The 12-hydroxy and 12-oxo compounds are poor competitors and are also biologically inactive. The radioiodinated [125I]12-iodo-JH I can be prepared in low yield at greater than 2500 Ci/mmol by nucleophilic displacement using no-carrier-added 125I-labeled sodium iodide in acetone; however, synthesis using sodium iodide carrier to give the approximately 50 Ci/mmol radioiodinated ligand proceeds in higher radiochemical yield with fewer by-products and provides a radioligand which is more readily handled in binding assays. The KD of [125I]12-iodo-JH I was determined for hemolymph JHBP of three insects: M. sexta, 795 nM; Galleria mellonella, 47 nM; Locusta migratoria, 77 nM. The selectivity of 12-iodo-JH I for the 32-kDa JHBP of M. sexta was demonstrated by direct autoradiography of a native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel of larval hemolymph incubated with the radioiodinated ligand. Thus, the in vitro and in vivo activity of 12-iodo-JH I indicate that it can serve as an important new gamma-emitting probe in the search for JH receptor proteins in target tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1581345381,"Bacteriophage T4 late gene promoters do not display sequence homology in the -35 region (Christensen, A. C., and Young, E. T. (1982) Nature 299, 369-371), suggesting an unusual geometry of RNA polymerase-promoter interaction. We have analyzed in vitro utilization of a late T4 promoter by RNA polymerase reconstituted from E. coli core enzyme (E) and bacteriophage T4 late sigma factor (sigma gp55). The E sigma gp55 holoenzyme forms a stable promoter complex which lacks protein-DNA contacts from position -30 and is sensitive to direct attack by heparin. This complex is capable of reiterative oligonucleotide synthesis (abortive initiation). Kinetic analysis of complex formation reveals a rapidly forming inactive intermediate (closed complex) which is slowly isomerized into a catalytically active form (open complex). The results indicate that all components essential for promoter binding, open complex formation, and initiation of transcription are present in the part of the RNA polymerase molecule, which is defined by the -30 to +20 footprint. On the basis of these observations and the results of others, we suggest that during transcription initiation at bipartite (Escherichia coli) promoters, an upstream DNA-binding domain of RNA polymerase which recognizes specific sequence elements in the -35 region plays an auxiliary role by regulating the rate of productive interactions in the downstream part of the molecule through an allosteric mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1540927271,"Antithrombin III exists in plasma as major and minor isoforms differing in affinity for heparin. The nature of the binding of each purified isoform to immobilized heparins was investigated. Unfractionated, mixed-affinity heparin bound each isoform with both high affinity and concentration-dependent low affinity. The isoforms were resolved when filtered through low-affinity heparin (heparin repeatedly passed over immobilized antithrombin III) columns. Following chemical modification of a specific tryptophan residue required for heparin binding, each isoform failed to bind to either low-affinity or mixed-affinity heparin-agarose, but elution of the modified higher-affinity isoform was retarded on both gels. Because the modified lower-affinity isoform eluted with the similarly sized bovine serum albumin in these experiments, the difference in isoform affinity for heparin appears to be the result of a unique, secondary heparin-binding site in the higher-affinity isoform that can bind a heparin site with low affinity for antithrombin III. This interpretation was supported by the chromatographic behavior of the isoforms on mixed-affinity agarose during reverse gradient elution. Two other populations of each of the tryptophan-modified isoforms were identified. Since these isoforms bound tightly to mixed-affinity heparin-agarose but eluted at lower salt concentrations than the corresponding unmodified isoforms, both isoforms may contain additional secondary sites that interact weakly with heparin. A general model of heparin-antithrombin III interaction is proposed in which a high-affinity heparin site initially interacts with a primary site on antithrombin III. The subsequent conformational change leads to a cooperative, entropy-driven association between secondary sites on the protein and low-affinity sites on heparin, stabilizing antithrombin III in its activated form."
https://openalex.org/W1522941161,"The thermal decarboxylation of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-gamma-carboxyglutamic acid alpha-methyl ester [Z)-L-Gla-OMe) has been studied. In the presence of increasing amounts of calcium or magnesium ions, lyophilized powders of (Z)-L-Gla-OMe exhibit a corresponding increase in thermal stability. Both magnesium and calcium form relatively tight, thermally stable complexes with (Z)-L-Gla-OMe at high metal ion concentrations. Differences between Ca(II) and Mg(II) binding are noted at low metal ion concentrations, where (Z)-L-Gla-OMe is in excess. Under these conditions, complex formation with Mg(II) apparently favors a 2:1 Gla-magnesium ion complex in which both Gla residues are unstable to thermal decarboxylation. Calcium ion complexes, however, are found to favor a 3:1 Gla-calcium ion complex in which 1 of the 3 Gla residues is thermally stable."
https://openalex.org/W1590802018,"Modification of the free alkali light chains of myosin by iodoacetylation results in a much lower extent of exchange into myosin subfragment 1 by the thermal hybridization procedure (Burke, M., and Sivaramakrishnan, M. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 5908-5913). As reported by others (Wagner, P. D., and Stone, D. B. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8876-8882), free alkali light chains modified by iodoacetate at their single sulfhydryl residue exhibit minimal exchange into intact myosin. However, when unmodified alkali light chain is used to probe for exchange, close to the theoretical limit of exchange is observed for subfragment 1, and significant levels of exchange are found for myosin. It appears that modification of the free alkali light chain alters the structure of the protein, and this causes either a marked reduction in its affinity for the heavy chain or in its ability to enter the light chain binding site. This conclusion is supported by tryptic digestions done on the unmodified and modified free light chains where it is found that the latter is degraded at a much faster rate, indicating a more open structure for the modified protein. The observation that alkali light chain exchanges into myosin when unmodified alkali light chains are used indicates that the presence of the associated 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) light chains does not preclude the reversible dissociation of this subunit from myosin under ionic and temperature conditions approaching the physiological state."
