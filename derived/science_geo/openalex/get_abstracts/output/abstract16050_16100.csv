https://openalex.org/W1649452503,"Secreted metalloproteases initiating proteolytic degradation of collagens and proteoglycans play a critical role in remodeling of the connective tissue. Activation of the secreted proenzymes and interaction with their specific inhibitors TIMP and TIMP-2 are responsible for regulation of enzyme activity in extracellular space. We have previously demonstrated that 92- and 72-kDa Type IV procollagenases, in contrast to interstitial collagenase (ClI), form specific complexes with TIMP and the related inhibitor TIMP-2, respectively. The physiologic significance of the proenzyme-inhibitor complex and the mechanism of activation of Type IV collagenases remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that in the absence of TIMP, 92-kDa Type IV procollagenase (92T4Cl) can form a covalent homodimer and a novel complex with ClI. In the presence of TIMP, the formation of a 92T4Cl proenzyme complex with TIMP prevents dimerization, formation of the complex with ClI, and activation of the 92T4Cl proenzyme by stromelysin, a related metalloprotease. The proenzyme homodimer is unable to form a complex with TIMP. All TIMP-free forms of the proenzyme can be activated by stromelysin. The 92T4Cl-ClI complex can be activated to yield a complex active against both gelatin and fibrillar Type I collagen, suggesting a mechanism for cooperative action of two enzymes in reducing collagen fibrils to small peptides under physiologic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1751435293,"The murine receptor for luteinizing hormone (LHR) was cloned and expressed in L cells. This LHR (mature protein of 674 amino acids) is very similar to that of the rat (same length, 36 amino acid differences) but differs significantly more from that of man (673 amino acids, 109 differences). Expression of the murine LHR in L cells led to the appearance of binding sites for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) with a Kd of 150 pM and an LH- and hCG-stimulable adenylyl cyclase activity (EC50 = 50-100 pM hCG). Upon labeling pools of phosphoinositides with [3H]myo-inositol, L cells expressing the murine LHR responded to hCG with an increase in their rate of phosphoinositide hydrolysis (EC50 = 2,400 pM hCG). This was accompanied by an increase in intracellular Ca2+ [( Ca2+]i), as determined by the Fura2 method. This increase in [Ca2+]i in response to hCG was dependent on the LHR, for HCG did not affect [Ca2+]i in L cells not expressing the LHR. The effect was not due to the cAMP-forming activity of the LH receptor, for neither forskolin nor prostaglandin E1, which both increase cAMP levels in L cells, had a similar effect in either control or LHR-expressing cells and isoproterenol had no effect in L cells expressing a functionally active hamster beta-adrenergic receptor. The effect was also not due to overexpression of a Gs-coupled receptor, for L cells expressing 8-fold higher levels of the human V2 vasopressin receptor did not mimic the Ca(2+)-mobilizing response of the LH receptor. We conclude that the LH receptor has the capability of activating two intracellular signaling pathways: one leading to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and resulting in increases in cAMP and a second leading to stimulation of phospholipase C and resulting in formation of inositol phosphates and elevations in [Ca2+]i. These data correlate positively with and provide a mechanistic explanation for previous reports on the ability of hCG to mobilize phosphoinositides and increasing [Ca2+]i in luteal and granulosa cells (e.g. Davis, J. S., West, L. A., and Farese, R. V. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 15028-15034)."

https://openalex.org/W1546476211,"Some strains of Staphylococcus aureus bind collagen with a high degree of specificity and affinity. This interaction can represent a mechanism of substrate adhesion and may be an important step in the pathogenesis of osteomyelitis and infectious arthritis. We now report on the cloning, sequencing, and expression of a gene name cna, encoding a S. aureus collagen adhesin. The cna gene was isolated from a lambda GT11 S. aureus genomic library and encodes an 1185 amino acid polypeptide. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals several structural characteristics similar to previously described Gram-positive bacterial cell surface proteins. Antibodies raised against the native collagen adhesin from S. aureus recognize the recombinant collagen adhesin. Collagen binding activity can be detected in a lysate obtained from Escherichia coli cells, which harbor the cloned cna gene on an expression plasmid. Collagen-binding proteins can be detected in the lysate when analyzed by a Western blot type assay in which the membrane-transferred proteins are probed with radioactively labeled collagen. Finally, the bacterial lysate containing the recombinant adhesin can effectively inhibit the binding of soluble collagen to cells of S. aureus."

https://openalex.org/W1501970115,"We screened 77 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines for mutations of the p53 gene using a single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) assay. We found that 57 cell lines (74%) had mutations of the p53 gene. Three cell lines had a deletion of the p53 gene. Of the remaining 54 cell lines, 49 cell lines were sequenced and 52 mutations were confirmed. In contrast to previously published p53 mutations in other human tumors, the p53 gene mutations in NSCLC were diverse with regard to the location and nature of the mutations. The region corresponding to codons 144-166, which is outside the evolutionarily conserved regions, was a frequent site of p53 gene mutations in NSCLC. The presence of a p53 gene mutation was not associated with age, sex, histological types, culture site, treatment intent, presence of prior cytotoxic treatment, neuroendocrine differentiation, median culture time or patient survival. The prevalence of p53 mutations in cell lines with ras mutations did not differ from that in cell lines without ras mutations. However, p53 gene mutations in NSCLC cell lines with ras mutations tended to cluster in exon 8, suggesting the presence of a functional domain of the p53 gene relating to interaction with the ras gene. We conclude that p53 and ras mutations are frequent and apparently independent genetic alterations which play different roles in the pathogenesis, progression and prognosis of NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W1509623942,"Human platelets undergo a rapid, major reorganization of the cytoskeletal matrix upon exposure to thrombin, and accumulate 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner. These phosphoinositides have been suggested to be involved in actin polymerization/depolymerization. We reasoned that, if newly generated 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositide modulates cytoskeletal reorganization, a prerequisite for such action would be generation near cytoskeletal proteins. We have found that, after platelet activation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphatidylinositol(4)P 3-kinase activities, antibody-detectable phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and PKC become markedly and specifically enriched in a Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction that contains GPIIb/IIIa (integrin) and pp60c-src. The cytoskeletal fraction then accounts for up to 70% of total phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity, a function of recruited activated enzyme. These proteins are not occluded or directly associated with newly polymerized actin, since blockage by cytochalasin D of actin polymerization, and consequent inhibition of accumulation of about 40% of incremental protein and actin in this fraction, has no effect on its content of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, GPIIb/IIIa, pp60c-src, or PKC. Depolymerization of actin with DNase I, or inhibition of ligand binding to GPIIb/IIIa by RGDS, however, in combination with cytochalasin D, further depletes actin and significantly decreases sedimentability of GPIIb/IIIa as well as phosphoinositide 3-kinase, pp60c-src, and PKC, without inhibiting total 3-kinase activity. Our results suggest that, as a function of platelet activation, enzymes that regulate the synthesis of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides rapidly associate with the membrane skeleton and that skeletally associated phosphoinositide 3-kinase is more active than the Triton-soluble form."
https://openalex.org/W1519464528,"L6 myoblasts spontaneously undergo differentiation and cell fusion into myotubes. These cells express both GLUT1 and GLUT4 glucose transporters, but their expression varies during myogenesis. We now report that the subcellular distribution and the protein processing by glycosylation of both glucose transporter isoforms also change during myogenesis. Crude plasma membrane and light microsome fractions were isolated from either myoblasts or myotubes and characterized by the presence of two functional proteins, the Na+/K(+)-ATPase and the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR). Immunoreactive alpha 1 subunit of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase was faint in the crude plasma membrane fraction from myoblasts, but abundant in both membrane fractions from myotubes. In contrast, the alpha 1 subunit of the DHPR, which is expressed only in differentiated muscle, was detected in crude plasma membrane from myotubes but not from myoblasts. Therefore, crude plasma membrane fractions from myoblasts and myotubes contain cell surface markers, and the composition of these membranes appears to be developmentally regulated during myogenesis. GLUT1 protein was more abundant in the crude plasma membrane relative to the light microsome fraction prepared from either myoblasts or myotubes. The molecular size in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the GLUT1 transporters in myotubes was smaller than that in myoblasts (Mr 47,000 and 53,000, respectively). GLUT4 protein (Mr 48,000) was barely detectable in the crude plasma membrane fraction and was almost absent in the light microsome fraction prepared from myoblasts. However, GLUT4 protein was abundant in myotubes and was predominantly located in the light microsome fraction. Treatment with endoglycosidase F reduced the molecular size of the transporters in all fractions to Mr 46,000 for GLUT1 and Mr 47,000 for GLUT4 proteins. In myotubes, acute insulin treatment increased the crude plasma membrane content of GLUT1 marginally and of GLUT4 markedly, with a concomitant decrease in the light microsomal fraction. These results indicate that: (a) the subcellular distribution of glucose transporters is regulated during myogenesis, GLUT4 being preferentially sorted to intracellular membranes; (b) both GLUT1 and GLUT4 transporters are processed by N-linked glycosylation to form the mature transporters in the course of myogenesis; and (c) insulin causes modest recruitment of GLUT1 transporters and marked recruitment of GLUT4 transporters, from light microsomes to plasma membranes in L6 myotubes."
https://openalex.org/W2075172074,"In cardiac myocytes, calcium influx through the calcium channel is the primary pathway for triggering calcium release. Recently it has been suggested that the calcium-induced calcium release mechanism can also be activated indirectly by the sodium current, which elevates the sodium concentration under the cell membrane, thereby favoring the entry of ""trigger"" calcium via the sodium-calcium exchanger. To test this hypothesis, sodium current was suppressed by reducing the external sodium concentration or applying tetrodotoxin. At potentials positive to -30 millivolts, calcium release was unaffected. A small calcium release at more negative potentials could be attributed to partial activation of calcium channels, because it was unaltered by replacement of sodium with lithium and was blocked by cadmium. Thus, sodium influx or its accumulation does not initiate calcium release. In addition, sodium-calcium exchange-related calcium release at potentials positive to +80 millivolts has slower kinetics than calcium channel-induced release. Therefore, only the calcium channel gates the fast release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the range of the action potential."
https://openalex.org/W2074192925,"T cell signaling via the CD4 surface antigen is mediated by the associated tyrosyl protein kinase p56lck. The 42-kilodalton mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (p42mapk) was tyrosyl-phosphorylated and activated after treatment of the murine T lymphoma cell line 171CD4+, which expresses CD4, with antibody to CD3. Treatment of the CD4-deficient cell line 171 with the same antibody did not result in phosphorylation or activation of p42mapk. Purified p56lck both tyrosyl-phosphorylated and stimulated the seryl-threonyl phosphotransferase activity of purified p44mpk, a MAP kinase isoform from sea star oocytes. A synthetic peptide modeled after the putative regulatory phosphorylation site in murine p42mapk (Tyr185) was phosphorylated by p56lck with a similar Vmax, but a fivefold lower Michaelis constant (Km) than a peptide containing the Tyr394 autophosphorylation site from p56lck. MAP kinases may participate in protein kinase cascades that link Src family protein-tyrosyl kinases to seryl-threonyl kinases such as those encoded by rsk and raf, which are putative substrates of MAP kinases."

https://openalex.org/W1497519474,"To investigate the mechanisms of agonist-promoted desensitization of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2AR), the human alpha 2AAR and a mutated form of the receptor were expressed in CHW cells. After cells were exposed to epinephrine for 30 min, the ability of the wild type alpha 2AAR to mediate inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase was depressed by approximately 78%. To assess the role of receptor phosphorylation during desensitization, cells were incubated with 32Pi, exposed to agonist, and alpha 2AAR purified by immunoprecipitation with a fusion protein antibody. Agonist-promoted desensitization was found to be accompanied by phosphorylation of the alpha 2AAR in vivo. The beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) is known to phosphorylate purified alpha 2AAR in vitro. We found that heparin, a beta ARK inhibitor, ablated short term agonist-induced desensitization of alpha 2AAR, while such desensitization was unaffected by inhibition of protein kinase A. To further assess the role of beta ARK, we constructed a mutated alpha 2AAR which has a portion of the third intracellular loop containing 9 serines and threonines (potential phosphorylation sites) deleted. This mutated alpha 2AAR failed to undergo short term agonist-induced desensitization. Agonist promoted in vivo phosphorylation of this mutated receptor was reduced by 90%, consistent with the notion that receptor phosphorylation at sites in the third intracellular loop plays a critical role in alpha 2AAR desensitization. After 24 h of agonist exposure, an even more profound desensitization of alpha 2AAR occurred, which was not accompanied by a decrease in receptor expression. Rather, long term agonist-induced desensitization was found to be due in part to a decrease in the amount of cellular Gi, which was not dependent on receptor third loop phosphorylation sites."
https://openalex.org/W1567445337,"To investigate the signaling mechanism of the 55-kDa tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor a functional transfection based assay was developed. The human 55-kDa TNF receptor, stably expressed in mouse L929 cells, was demonstrated to be activated specifically by agonist antibodies and to initiate a signal for cellular cytotoxicity. A deletion mutant of the human TNF receptor lacking most of the cytoplasmic domain was found to be completely defective in generating the signal for cytotoxicity. Additionally, expression of the truncated receptor substantially suppressed signaling by endogenous mouse TNF receptors in response to TNF, but not in response to specific anti-murine TNF receptor antibodies. These results suggest that aggregation of 55-kDa TNF receptor intracellular domains, which are not associated in the absence of ligand, is an important component of the signal for cellular toxicity. This work also provides an example of a dominant negative mutation in a transmembrane receptor that lacks a tyrosine kinase domain, and suggests a more general utility of dominant negative mutations in the investigation of cytokine receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1525549859,"A fluorescence assay was used to measure the processivity of Escherichia coli recBCD enzyme helicase activity. Under standard conditions, recBCD enzyme unwinds an average of 30 +/- 3.2 kilobase pairs (kb)/DNA end before dissociating. The average processivity (P obs) of DNA unwinding under these conditions is 0.99997, indicating that the probability of unwinding another base pair is 30,000-fold greater than the probability of dissociating from the double-stranded DNA. The average number of base pairs unwound per binding event (N) is sensitive to both mono- and divalent salt concentration and ranges from 36 kb at 80 mM NaCl to 15 kb at 280 mM NaCl. The processivity of unwinding increases in a hyperbolic manner with increasing ATP concentration, yielding a KN value for ATP of 41 +/- 9 microM and a limiting value of 32 +/- 1.8 kb/end for the number of base pairs unwound. The importance of the processivity of recBCD enzyme helicase activity to the recBCD enzyme-dependent stimulation of recombination at Chi sites observed in vivo is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1576964169,"The nature of the axial ligation to heme iron has been suggested to be the major determinant of the oxidation-reduction potential of a particular cytochrome, but natural cytochromes that vary significantly in E'm invariably differ from one another in many ways. We proposed to clarify this issue by engineering many different ligation patterns within the same basic molecule, mitochondrial cytochrome c. Since many of the potentially informative substitutions require non-coded amino acids, semisynthesis was the approach we chose, and solid-phase peptide synthesis was used to make a set of nin 39-residue peptides that have been incorporated by autocatalytic fragment religation into the structure of horse cytochrome c. An additional two analogues modified at this position were made by chemical modification of the whole protein. As well as looking at the effect on reduction potential, we examined the effect of varying the ligand sphere on the efficiency of the autocatalytic fragment religation reaction, on the conformation of cytochrome c, on its spectroscopic properties, and in promoting electron transfer between heme c and other redox centers. Substitute residues were chosen to put sulfur, selenium, oxygen, and nitrogen, or even no ligating atom at all in the place of methionine sulfur. We found both subtle and dramatic alterations in spectral properties, which were informative about changes in internal structure and stability brought about by the modifications and which may be useful in identifying novel natural ligation patterns. An unexpected finding was that alanine 80 cytochrome c acquires a hemoglobin-like spectrum, and binds O2 most effectively. Reduction potential changes of greater than 300 mV with nitrogen, greater than 400 mV with oxygen, and greater than 300 mV with thiol sulfur ligation were observed, confirming that variation of the ligand sphere is indeed the most effective way in which the protein coat may modulate the potential of the redox center it encloses. Finally, we obtained more evidence that this axial ligand plays an active role in electron transfer and discovered that histidine could be even more effective in this role."

https://openalex.org/W1537216823,"Genistein, an isoflavone putative tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was used to investigate the coupling of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activation to four metabolic effects of insulin in the isolated rat adipocyte. Genistein inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation in a concentration-dependent manner with an ID50 of 25 micrograms/ml and complete inhibition at 100 micrograms/ml. Genistein also prevented insulin's (10(-9) M) inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis with an ID50 of 15 micrograms/ml and a complete effect at 50 micrograms/ml. The effect of genistein (25 micrograms/ml) was not reversed by supraphysiological (10(-7) M) insulin levels. In contrast, genistein up to 100 micrograms/ml had no effect on insulin's (10(-9) M) stimulation of either pyruvate dehydrogenase or glycogen synthase activity. We determined whether genistein influenced insulin receptor beta-subunit autophosphorylation or tyrosine kinase substrate phosphorylation either in vivo or in vitro by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Genistein at 100 micrograms/ml did not inhibit insulin's (10(-7) M) stimulation of insulin receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation or tyrosine phosphorylation of the cellular substrates pp185 and pp60. Also, genistein did not prevent insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of partially purified human insulin receptors from NIH 3T3/HIR 3.5 cells or the phosphorylation of histones by the activated receptor tyrosine kinase. In control experiments using either NIH 3T3 fibroblasts or partially purified membranes from these cells, genistein did inhibit platelet-derived growth factor's stimulation of its receptor autophosphorylation. These findings indicate the following: (a) Genistein can inhibit certain responses to insulin without blocking insulin's stimulation of its receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation or of the receptor kinase substrate tyrosine phosphorylation. (b) In adipocytes genistein must block the stimulation of glucose oxidation and the antilipolytic effects of insulin at site(s) downstream from the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. (c) The inhibitory effects of genistein on hormonal signal transduction cannot necessarily be attributed to inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity, unless specifically demonstrated."

https://openalex.org/W1532322015,"We have recently demonstrated that the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel in the apical membrane of the renal epithelial cell line, A6, is modulated by the alpha i-3 subunit of the Gi-3 protein. We also showed that a 700-kDa protein complex can be purified from the membranes of A6 epithelia which (a) can reconstitute the amiloride-sensitive Na+ influx in liposomes and planar bilayer membranes and (b) consists of six major protein bands observed on reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with molecular masses ranging from 35 to 320 kDa. The present study was undertaken to determine if the alpha i-3 subunit was a member of this Na+ channel complex. G alpha i structure and function were identified by Western blotting with specific G alpha i subunit antibodies and Na+ channel antibodies, through ADP-ribosylation with pertussis toxin, and by immunocytochemical localization of the Na+ channel and G alpha i proteins. We demonstrate that two protein substrates are ADP-ribosylated in the 700-kDa complex in the presence of pertussis toxin and are specifically immunoprecipitated with an anti-Na+ channel polyclonal antibody. One of these substrates, a 41-kDa protein, was identified as the alpha i-3 subunit of the Gi-3 protein on Western blots with specific antibodies. Na+ channel antibodies do not recognize G alpha i-3 on Western blots of Golgi membranes which contain alpha i-3 but not Na+ channel proteins, nor do they immunoprecipitate alpha i-3 from solubilized Golgi membranes; however, alpha i-3 is coprecipitated as part of the Na+ channel complex from A6 cell membranes by polyclonal Na+ channel antibodies. Both alpha i-3 and the Na+ channel have been localized in A6 cells by confocal imaging and immunofluorescence with specific antibodies and are found to be in distinct but adjacent domains of the apical cell surface. In functional studies, alpha i-3, but not alpha i-2, stimulates Na+ channel activity. These data are therefore consistent with the localization of Na+ channel activity and modulatory alpha i-3 protein at the apical plasma membrane, which together represent a specific signal transduction pathway for ion channel regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1521595809,"We have investigated phospholipase D activity in rat brain cortical slices prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid. In the presence of ethanol (170 mM), norepinephrine stimulated, in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 = 2.2 microM), the accumulation of [32P]phosphatidylethanol as a result of phospholipase D activity. Norepinephrine-stimulated phospholipase D activity was completely inhibited by prazosin, a specific alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist (Ki = 2.8 nM). However, no accumulation of phosphatidylethanol was observed in the presence of the muscarinic agonist carbachol. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin and the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) also stimulated [32P]phosphatidylethanol accumulation in cortical slices, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas the inactive phorbol, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, did not stimulate phospholipase D activity. Staurosporine and 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine, two potent inhibitors of protein kinase C, inhibited PMA and ionomycin stimulation of phospholipase D activity, but did not affect the response to norepinephrine. Furthermore, the effects of PMA and norepinephrine were additive. Differences between PMA and norepinephrine stimulation of phospholipase D activity were also found with regard to the extracellular Ca2+ requirement and time course of phosphatidylethanol accumulation. No stimulation of phospholipase D activity by norepinephrine was observed in slices from cerebellum, a brain area with a low density of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, while the effect of PMA was greater in the cerebellum than in cortical or hippocampal slices. These results strongly suggest that activation of phospholipase D in cortical slices by norepinephrine and PMA involve different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1613943426,"Several studies have demonstrated that the intrinsic catalytic activity of cell surface glucose transporters is highly regulated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing GLUT1 (erythrocyte/brain) and GLUT4 (adipocyte/skeletal muscle) glucose transporter isoforms. For example, inhibition of protein synthesis in these cells by anisomycin or cycloheximide leads to marked increases in hexose transport without a change in the levels of cell surface glucose transporter proteins (Clancy, B. M., Harrison, S. A., Buxton, J. M., and Czech, M. P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10122-10130). In the present work the exofacial hexose binding sites on GLUT1 and GLUT4 in anisomycin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were labeled with the cell-impermeant photoaffinity reagent [2-3H]2-N-[4-(1-azitrifluoroethyl)benzoyl]-1,3-bis- (D-mannos-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine [( 2-3H] ATB-BMPA) to determine which isoform is activated by protein synthetic blockade. As expected, a 15-fold increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake in response to insulin was associated with 1.7- and 2.6-fold elevations in plasma membrane GLUT1 and GLUT4 protein levels, respectively. Anisomycin treatment of cultured adipocytes for 5 h produced an 8-fold stimulation of hexose transport but no increase in the content of glucose transporters in the plasma membrane fraction as measured by protein immunoblot analysis. Cell surface GLUT1 levels were also shown to be unaffected on 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to anisomycin using an independent method, the binding of an antiexofacial GLUT1 antibody to intact cells. In contrast, anisomycin fully mimicked the action of insulin to stimulate (about 4-fold) the radiolabeling of GLUT1 transporters specifically immunoprecipitated from intact 3T3-L1 adipocytes irradiated after incubation with [2-3H] ATB-BMPA. Photolabeling of GLUT4 under these conditions was also significantly enhanced (1.8-fold) by anisomycin treatment, but this effect was only 15% of that caused by insulin. These results suggest that: 1) the photoaffinity reagent [2-3H]ATB-BMPA labels those cell surface glucose transporters present in a catalytically active state rather than total cell surface transporters as assumed previously and 2) inhibition of protein synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes stimulates sugar transport primarily by enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity of cell surface GLUT1, and to a lesser extent, GLUT4 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1878298478,"Recent studies have shown that vitamin B6 modulates transcriptional activation by the human glucocorticoid receptor in HeLa S3 cells. We have now examined the possibility that vitamin B6 might similarly influence transcriptional activation by the glucocorticoid receptor in other cell types, as well as gene expression mediated by other members of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. We show that elevated vitamin B6 concentrations suppress by 40-65% the level of transcription mediated through the endogenous murine L cell glucocorticoid receptor, as well as the human receptor transfected into E8.2 and T47D cells. In contrast, glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcription was enhanced 60-110% in mild vitamin deficiency. The level of hormone-independent constitutive gene expression was not affected by these same alterations in vitamin B6 concentration. These studies indicated that the transcriptional modulatory effects of the vitamin were neither restricted to specific cell types nor limited to the human form of the glucocorticoid receptor. We next determined if hormone-induced transcription by several other steroid receptors (androgen, progesterone, and estrogen receptors) was analogously affected by alterations in vitamin B6 concentration. Analysis of gene expression mediated through the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter revealed that transcriptional activation of both the androgen and progesterone receptors was reduced by 35-40% under conditions of elevated vitamin B6 and enhanced by 60-90% in deficiency, again under conditions where constitutive expression was unaffected. Using a different promoter, the estrogen-regulated vitellogenin promoter, we found that transcriptional activation of the estrogen receptor was similarly affected. Estrogen-induced gene expression was reduced by 30% under conditions of elevated intracellular vitamin B6 and enhanced by 85% in vitamin deficiency. Thus, vitamin B6 modulates transcriptional activation by multiple classes of steroid hormone receptors. The similarities in vitamin B6 effects on transcription mediated through different promoters, the mouse mammary tumor virus and vitellogenin promoters, suggest that this vitamin may modulate the expression of a diverse array of hormonally responsive genes. These observations together support the hypothesis that vitamin B6 represents a physiological modulator of steroid hormone action."

This antiserum, which is cardiac isoform-specific, immunoprecipitated greater than 90% of the [3H]ryanodine receptor binding sites solubilized from guinea pig brain membranes. The immunoprecipitated brain receptor exhibited the characteristic cardiac-type mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The brain ryanodine receptor, like the cardiac ryanodine receptor, was a substrate for CaM kinase. Affinity-purified, site-specific antibodies completely blocked phosphorylation of both brain and cardiac receptors by CaM kinase, and two-dimensional peptide mapping identified the same major 32P-labeled peptide in receptors from both tissues. 125I-Labeled receptors also gave the same peptide maps. These results confirm that mammalian brain expresses the cardiac isoform of the ryanodine receptor. Furthermore, the unique CaM kinase phosphorylation site, which has been shown to regulate Ca2+ channel activity, is conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1578933663,"Although normal human chorionic villi-associated hydrophobic placental folate receptors (PFR) are converted to hydrophilic forms by an endogenous, EDTA-sensitive, Mg(2+)-dependent protease under serum-free conditions (Verma, R. S., and Antony, A. C. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 12522-12535), it is not known whether hydrophobic PFR are also susceptible to conversion by endogenous phospholipases. We isolated and characterized hydrophobic PFR, and tested the hypothesis that purified, in situ, and de novo-synthesized native PFR were covalently linked to glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. 125I-hydrophobic PFR, but not 125I-hydrophilic PFR, (i) separated into the Triton X-114 micellar phase at 30 degrees C, (ii) efficiently incorporated into phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol liposomes, and (iii) were covalently labeled by the hydrophobic probe 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(meta[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine, [125I]TID. (iv) [125I]TID-labeled- and [phenyl-3H]Triton X-100-bound hydrophobic PFR, as well as native PFR in situ, were released as hydrophilic forms by recombinant (r) GPI-specific phospholipase(PL) C (GPI-PLC), and GPI-PLD (but not by PLC), in the absence and presence of a concentration of EDTA known to inhibit endogenous Mg(2+)-dependent protease. (v) Nitrous acid deamination of [125I]TID-labeled hydrophobic PFR as well as (r)GPI-PLC cleavage of [phenyl-3H]Triton-X-100- and [125I] TID-labeled hydrophobic PFR, released hydrophobic radiolabeled moieties which comigrated on thin layer chromatography distinct from free radiolabel. Finally, (vi) biosynthetic studies on chorionic villi cultured in vitro revealed incorporation of radiolabeled precursors into the GPI anchor of hydrophobic PFR. We conclude that native hydrophobic PFR are linked to GPI anchors and are therefore potential substrates for three distinct endogenous enzymes (GPI-PLC, GPI-PLD, and specific Mg(2+)-dependent metalloprotease) in maternal serum and placenta in vivo."

The purified protein is a monomer of 57 kDa molecular mass. It contains comparable amounts of iron and inorganic labile sulfur atoms and exhibits an optical spectrum typical of iron-sulfur proteins with maxima at 400, 305, and 280 nm. Mossbauer data of the as-isolated protein show two spectral components, a paramagnetic and a diamagnetic, of equal intensity. Detailed analysis of the paramagnetic component reveals six distinct antiferromagnetically coupled iron sites, providing direct spectroscopic evidence for the presence of a 6Fe cluster in this newly purified protein. One of the iron sites exhibits parameters (delta EQ = 2.67 +/- 0.03 mm/s and delta = 1.09 +/- 0.02 mm/s at 140 K) typical for high spin ferrous ion; the observed large isomer shift indicates an iron environment that is distinct from the tetrahedral sulfur coordination commonly observed for the iron atoms in iron-sulfur clusters and is consistent with a penta- or hexacoordination containing N and/or O ligands. The other five iron sites are most probably high spin ferric. Three of them show parameters characteristic for tetrahedral sulfur coordination. In correlation with the EPR spectrum of the as-purified protein which shows a resonance signal at g = 15.3 and a group of signals between g = 9.8 and 5.4, this 6Fe cluster is assigned to an unusual spin state of 9/2 with zero field splitting parameters D = -1.3 cm-1 and E/D = 0.062. Other EPR signals attributable to minor impurities are also observed at the g = 4.3 and 2.0 regions. The diamagnetic Mossbauer component represents a second iron cluster, which, upon reduction with dithionite, displays an intense S = 1/2 EPR signal with g values at 2.00, 1.83, and 1.31. In addition, an EPR signal of the S = 3/2 type is also observed for the dithionite-reduced protein."
https://openalex.org/W1809802001,"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is a mosaic glycoprotein composed of an epidermal growth factor-like (EGF), a kringle and a serine protease (SP) module. It exists in single and two-chain forms designated HMW pro-uPA and HMW uPA, respectively. A low molecular weight form, LMW uPA, lacks the EGF and kringle modules and is composed of the SP module alone. Recombinant-expressed proteins representing both HMW forms exhibit four reversible unfolding transitions that are resolved by deconvolution of melting curves obtained by differential scanning calorimetry at pH 4.5; no differences in the melting properties of the single and two-chain forms were found. The proteolytic fragment Ser1-Lys135 (EGF-kringle) exhibits two transitions, while the isolated EGF and kringle modules each exhibit a single two-state transition. Thus, both of these modules retain an independently folded compact structure when isolated. The isolated SP module (LMW uPA) exhibits two closely spaced transitions at low pH indicating the melting of two domains of similar stability. Fluorescence-detected melting curves of LMW uPA reveal increasing cooperativity with increasing pH, suggesting an increase in the interaction between the two SP domains. Treatment of both HMW and LMW uPA with the tripeptide inhibitor Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone dramatically increased the stability of both domains of the SP module which now melt together in a single two-state transition, even at low pH, with no effect on the EGF and kringle modules. From these data one concludes that UK consists of four independently folded domains. Two are formed by the EGF and kringle modules which do not interact with each other or with the SP module. The SP module contains two domains that are independent at low pH but exhibit a tendency to merge into a single cooperative unit at neutral pH or after treatment with the tripeptide inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1546793327,"The glucose transporter of the bacterial phosphotransferase system couples translocation with phosphorylation of the substrate in a 1:1 stoichiometry. It is a complex consisting of a transmembrane subunit (IIGlc) and a hydrophilic subunit (IIIGlc). Both subunits are transiently phosphorylated. IIIGlc is phosphorylated at a histidyl residue by the cytoplasmic phosphoryl carrier protein phospho-heat-stable phosphoryl carrier protein; IIGlc is phosphorylated at a cysteinyl residue by phospho-IIIGlc. The IIGlc subunit consists of two domains. The N-terminal hydrophobic domain is presumed to span the membrane several times; the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain includes the phosphorylation site. IIGlc phosphorylates glucose and methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside in transit across the inner membrane but can also phosphorylate intracellular glucose. Ten mutants resistant against extracellular toxic methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside yet capable of phosphorylating intracellular glucose were isolated. Strong impairment of transport activity in these mutants was accompanied by only a slight decrease of phosphorylation activity. Amino acid substitutions occurred at six sites that are clustered in three presumably hydrophilic loops in the transmembrane domain of IIGlc: M17T, M17I, G149S, K150E, S157F, H339Y, and D343G. We presume that the three polypeptide segments are directly involved in sugar translocation and/or binding but are of little importance for phosphorylation activity, folding, and membrane localization of IIGlc."
https://openalex.org/W1483414388,"The functional organization of the human insulin receptor (hIR) promoter was analyzed by deletion mutagenesis and protein-DNA interaction studies. A series of deletion mutants was expressed transiently in two human hepatocytes, HepG2 and PLC. The results revealed that the promoter region between -692 and -345 is essential for efficient transcription of the hIR gene. Multiple trans-acting factors were identified by band shift and footprinting analyses. Sp1 binds to a cluster of GC boxes and two GGGAGG hexamers locating at -637 to -594. Adjacent to GC boxes, there are two regions, from -550 to -530 and from -522 to -503, which bind to two novel factors, IRNF-I and IRNF-II. These two factors are distributed differentially in different cell lines. Linker scanning mutations on GC, GA boxes, or the IRNF-I binding site significantly decreased the transcriptional activity, indicating that IRNF-I and Sp1 are important for hIR promoter activity. In addition, we demonstrated that glucocorticoid-dependent transcriptional induction of hIR mRNA in vivo is conferred by a glucocorticoid response element in the hIR promoter. Taken together, these results imply that transcription of the human insulin receptor gene is regulated by multiple protein-DNA interactions occurring within the defined promoter region."
https://openalex.org/W1531326750,"Signal generation during the stimulation of insulin secretion by arginine vasopressin (AVP) was investigated in RINm5F cells. AVP (0.1 microM) caused a biphasic cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) rise, namely a rapid transient marked elevation after stimulation followed by a series of oscillations. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the sustained oscillations were abolished, while the initial [Ca2+]i transient was only partly decreased, indicating that the former are due to Ca2+ influx and the latter due mainly to mobilization from internal Ca2+ stores. AVP also evoked a transient depolarization of the average membrane potential. AVP-induced Ca2+ influx during the sustained phase, which was strictly dependent on receptor occupancy, was attenuated by membrane hyperpolarization with diazoxide. However, blockade of Ca2+ channels of the L- or T-type was ineffective. AVP stimulated production of diacylglycerol and inositol phosphates; for the latter both [3H] inositol labeling and mass determinations were performed. A transient increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 was followed by a marked enhancement of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (8-fold) peaking at 15 s and gradually returning to basal values. Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 and Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 exhibited the most long-lasting augmentation (4- and 1.7-fold, respectively), and therefore correlated best with the period of sustained [Ca2+]i oscillations. InsP5 and InsP6 were not elevated. The effects of AVP, including the stimulation of insulin secretion from perifused cells, were obliterated by a V1 receptor antagonist. In conclusion, AVP induces protracted [Ca2+]i elevation in RINm5F cells which is associated with long-lasting increases in InsP4 isomers. The accumulation of InsP4 isomers reflects receptor occupancy and accelerated metabolism of the inositol phosphates. Activation of second messenger-operated Ca2+ channels is not necessarily implicated because of the attenuating effect of membrane hyperpolarization."
https://openalex.org/W1558930472,"Abstract To identify those residues involved in fructose 6-phosphate binding to the kinase domain of rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase site-directed mutations were engineered at Lys194, Arg195, Arg230, and Arg238. The mutant enzymes were purified to homogeneity by anion exchange and Blue-Sepharose chromatography and/or substrate elution from phosphocellulose columns. Circular dichroism experiments demonstrated that all of the single amino acid mutations had no effect on the secondary structure of the protein. In addition, when fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase activity was measured, all mutants had Km values for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, Ki values for fructose 6-phosphate, and maximal velocities similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. Mutation of Arg195----Ala, or His, had little or no effect on the maximal velocity of the kinase but increased the Km for fructose 6-phosphate greater than 3,000-fold. Furthermore, the Ka for phosphate for Arg195Ala was increased 100-fold compared with the wild-type enzyme. Mutation of Lys194----Ala had no effect on maximal velocity or the Km for fructose 6-phosphate. Mutation of either Arg230 or Arg238----Ala increased the maximal velocity and the Km for fructose-6 phosphate of the kinase by 2-3-fold but had no effect on fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. However, the Km values for ATP of the Arg230Ala and Arg238Ala mutants were 30-40-fold higher than that for the wild-type enzyme. Mutation of Gly48----Ala resulted in a form with no kinase activity, but fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase activity was identical to that of the wild-type enzyme. The results indicate that: 1) Arg195 is a critical residue for the binding of fructose 6-phosphate to the 6-phospho-fructo-2-kinase domain, and that interaction of the sugar phosphate with Arg195 is highly specific since mutation of the adjacent Lys194----Ala had no effect on fructose 6-phosphate binding; 2) Arg195 also play an important role in the binding of inorganic phosphate; and 3) Gly48 is an important residue in the nucleotide binding fold of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase and that both Arg230 and Arg238 are also involved in ATP binding; and 4) the bifunctional enzyme has two separate and independent fructose 6-phosphate binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1483533460,"Abstract Fluorescein derivatives are known to bind to nucleotide-binding sites on transport ATPases. In this study, they have been used as ligands to nucleotide-binding sites on ATP-sensitive K+ channels in insulinoma cells. Their effect on channel activity has been studied using 86Rb+ efflux and patch-clamp techniques. Fluorescein derivatives have two opposite effects. First, like ATP, they can inhibit active ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Second, they are able to reactivate ATP-sensitive K+ channels subjected to inactivation or run-down in the absence of cytoplasmic ATP. Therefore reactivation of the inactivated ATP-sensitive K+ channel clearly does not require channel phosphorylation as is commonly believed. The results indicate the existence of two binding sites for nucleotides, one activator site and one inhibitor site. Irreversible binding at either the inhibitor or the activator site on the channel was obtained with eosin-5-maleimide, resulting in irreversible inhibition or activation of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel respectively. The irreversibly activated channel could still be inhibited by 2 mM ATP. After activation by fluorescein derivatives, ATP-sensitive K+ channels become resistant to the classical blocker of this channel, the sulfonylurea glibenclamide. Negative allosteric interactions between fluorescein/nucleotide receptors and sulfonylurea-binding sites were suggested by results obtained in [3H]glibenclamide-binding experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1680354353,"Lysine 480 has been suggested to be essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis by Na,K-ATPase because it is labeled by reagents that are thought to react with the ATPase from within the ATP binding site. In order to test this hypothesis, Lys-480 was changed to Ala, Arg, or Glu by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resultant Na,K-ATPase molecules were expressed in yeast cells. The ATPase activity of each of the mutants was similar to the activity of the wild type enzyme indicating that Lys-480 is not essential for ATP hydrolysis. The binding of [3H]ouabain in both ATP-dependent and inorganic phosphate-dependent reactions was used to determine the apparent affinity of each mutant for ATP or Pi. The K0.5(ATP) for ouabain binding to phosphoenzyme formed from ATP was 1-3 microM for Lys-480, Arg-480, and Ala-480, whereas for Glu-480 the K0.5(ATP) was 18 microM. The K0.5(Pi) for ouabain binding to phosphoenzyme formed from inorganic phosphate was 16-28 microM for Lys-480, Arg-480, and Ala-480, but was 74 microM for Glu-480. The Kd for ouabain binding was similar for both the wild type and mutant Na,K-ATPase molecules (3-6 nM). These data indicate that the substitution of an acidic amino acid for lysine at position 480 appears to reduce the affinity of the Na,K-ATPase for both ATP and phosphate. It is concluded that Lys-480 is not essential for ATP binding or hydrolysis or for phosphate binding by Na,K-ATPase but is likely to be located within the ATP binding site of the Na,K-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1518586388,"S6 kinases I and II have been purified previously from Xenopus eggs and shown to be activated by phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues. An S6 kinase clone, closely related to S6 kinase II, was subsequently identified and the protein product was expressed in a baculovirus system. Using this protein, termed for Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinase, as a substrate, we have purified to homogeneity from unfertilized Xenopus eggs a 41-kDa serine/threonine kinase termed rsk kinase. Both microtubule-associated protein-2 and myelin basic protein are good substrates for rsk kinase, whereas alpha-casein, histone H1, protamine, and phosvitin are not. rsk kinase is inhibited by low concentrations of heparin as well as by beta-glycerophosphate and calcium. Activation of rsk kinase during Xenopus oocyte maturation is correlated with phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues. However, in vitro, rsk kinase undergoes autophosphorylation on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, identifying it as a dual specificity enzyme. Purified rsk kinase can be inactivated in vitro by either a 37-kDa T-cell protein-tyrosine phosphatase or the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A. Phosphatase-treated S6KII can be reactivated by rsk kinase, and S6 kinase activity in resting oocyte extracts increases significantly when purified rsk kinase is added. The availability of purified rsk kinase will enhance study of the signal transduction pathway(s) regulating phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in Xenopus oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1488137603,"High levels of circulating autoantibodies (auto-Ab) directed against phosphatidylinositides have been identified in the sera of patients with malignant tumors. These polyclonal autoantibodies had higher avidity and specificity for phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) than for the other phosphatidylinositides. Effects of the auto-Ab were studied in smooth muscle myocytes in the PtdIns-involving transduction mechanism triggered by activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Noradrenaline activated a Ca(2+)-dependent Cl- current through the Ca(2+)-releasing action of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and enhanced the Ca2+ channel current through a diacylglycerol and protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. External applications of auto-Ab (0.03-0.3 mg/ml) were without effect on noradrenaline-induced responses whereas intracellular applications (0.0004-0.012 mg/ml) inhibited both Cl- current activation and Ca2+ channel current stimulation. Intracellular applications of IgG from healthy donors had no effect on noradrenaline-induced responses. When anti-PtdIns Ab were preincubated with PtdIns the inhibition of the noradrenaline-induced responses on Ca2+ and Cl- channels was not observed. Autoanti-PtdIns Ab inhibited also the acetylcholine-activated Cl- current, confirming that the acetylcholine response was mediated through the phosphatidylinositol breakdown. In contrast, the autoanti-PtdIns Ab were ineffective against the transduction pathway after beta-adrenoceptor activation. Therefore, these results suggest that the biological effect of autoanti-PtdIns Ab results from a specific binding to membrane PtdIns or PtdIns metabolites and thereby prevented InsP3 and diacylglycerol production. These autoanti-PtdIns Ab appear to be a new specific tool to identify the role of phosphatidylinositides in intracellular transduction processes."
https://openalex.org/W1493627373,"Glucose-6-phosphatase activity has been determined in periportal and pericentral zones of the rat liver lobule using a quantitative histochemical method. The study was performed on unfixed cryostat sections of livers from fasted and fed female and male rats. Highest activity was found in periportal zones, and starvation caused a 2-3-fold increase of glucose-6-phosphatase activity in periportal and pericentral zones of both sexes. Unexpectedly, KM values were also significantly different in periportal and pericentral zones and were found to increase linearly with Vmax values, irrespective of sex and feeding condition. Because the cryofixation procedure was shown to permeabilize the biomembranes in the tissue sections, it can be concluded that the rise in KM and Vmax values has to be attributed to the catalytic unit of the glucose-6-phosphatase system. It is suggested that the enzyme exists in a high affinity configuration at low enzyme concentrations but that at high enzyme concentrations a hysteretic mechanism, as proposed by Berteloot et al. (Berteloot, A., Vidal, H., and Van de Werve, G. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5497-5507), transforms the enzyme from a high to a low affinity configuration. The present study indicates that the concept of functional heterogeneity of liver parenchyma may be more complex than thus far assumed."
https://openalex.org/W1494059093,"The targeting of creatine kinase isoenzymes to specific sites within muscle cells provides a system for the regeneration of ATP in situ from ADP and creatine phosphate. We have recently reported the colocalization of brain-type (B) creatine kinase and the nonsarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase isoenzymes in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the rat kidney, suggesting that creatine kinase may regenerate ATP for sodium transport (Friedman, D.L., and Perryman, M.B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 22404-22410). In order to test the hypothesis regarding the association of B creatine kinase with sodium transport, we examined the creatine kinase enzymes in the rectal (salt-secreting) gland of the dogfish shark which contains high levels of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase. The creatine kinase isoform composition was determined by non-denaturing electrophoresis, immunoblotting, protein purification, and amino acid sequence analysis. The results demonstrate both B creatine kinase and mitochondrial creatine kinase proteins are present in the rectal gland, an isoform composition which is the same as in the mammalian kidney. By using a combination of chromatographic techniques, shark B creatine kinase was purified to homogeneity and partial sequence data was obtained from two cyanogen bromide peptide fragments. One of these fragments contains the active site and is identical at all sequenced residues with the corresponding region from the echinoderm sperm flagellar creatine kinase, and is 96% homologous with both chicken and rat B creatine kinase subunits. The other fragment corresponds to a region near the N-terminal of mammalian creatine kinases and is 89% homologous with B creatine kinase from chicken. The localization of these isoforms was examined by immunocytochemistry using subunit specific antisera. Mitochondrial creatine kinase and B creatine kinase immunoreactivity are detected in all tubules, and is restricted to the basal region of the cells, which is the site of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase. The conservation of creatine kinase isoform expression in excretory tissue, and the localization of creatine kinase immunoreactivity in the basal region of the tubule cells, demonstrate that subcellular compartmentation of B creatine kinase may underly the functional coupling of creatine kinase activity with sodium transport."
https://openalex.org/W1533061970,"The muscle-specific regulatory factors MRF4 and myogenin, as well as the ubiquitous factor E12, belong to a protein family which shares a common structural motif referred to as the basic helix-loop-helix domain. Recent studies have demonstrated that MRF4 and myogenin, in the presence of E12, bind efficiently to enhancer regions of muscle-specific genes, thereby activating their transcription. Although several lines of evidence suggest that MRF4 and E12 or myogenin and E12 hetero-oligomers exist, direct studies revealing the composition of these protein complexes have not been reported. Here, we demonstrate that MRF4 and myogenin preferentially form heterodimers with E12 in solution and that heterodimer formation in vitro is greatly enhanced when the two proteins are co-synthesized. Utilizing a novel two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system, we have found that MRF4 and myogenin, when complexed with E12, bind as heterodimers to the E-box consensus sequences associated with the troponin I, M-creatine kinase, and myosin light chain gene enhancers. In all cases, higher order oligomer structures were not detected, demonstrating that in vitro DNA binding abilities of these basic helix-loop-helix proteins require heterodimer formation."
https://openalex.org/W1616904543,"The plasma membrane of Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains an H(+)-ATPase similar to the cation transport ATPases of other eukaryotic organisms. The fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of the purified H(+)-ATPase are characteristic of tryptophan residues. pH reduction from 7.5 to 5.7 produces a 4% decrease in fluorescence intensity, while a further reduction to pH 5.0 leads to an increase of fluorescence. A close correlation is observed between the pH dependence of the intrinsic fluorescence and the pH dependence of (i) ATPase activity, (ii) the fluorescence of Tb-formycin triphosphate bound to the active site, and (iii) inhibition by vanadate of ATPase activity. It is proposed that the effect of pH on intrinsic fluorescence reveals the existence of an H+ induced conformational change of the H(+)-ATPase similar to the E1----E2 transition of the other plasma membrane cation transport ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W1608323097,"In mouse hepatoma Hepa-1c1c7 cultures, polycyclic aromatic compounds such as benzol[a]pyrene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; dioxin) activate the Cyp1a-1 (cytochrome P(1)450) and Nmo-1[NAD(P)H:menadione-oxidoreductase] genes, two members of the aromatic hydrocarbon (Ah)-responsive gene battery. Mevinolin is known to inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (EC 1.1.1.34), the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. We show here that in the absence of TCDD, mevinolin markedly increases Cyp1a-1 transcription, CYP1A1 mRNA and protein levels and enzyme activity, and NMO1 mRNA concentrations. Addition of mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase activity, fails to reverse the effects of mevinolin. In fact, when used at high concentrations, mevalonate activates Cyp1a-1 transcription. Mevinolin-induced Cyp1a-1 gene activation: (1) occurs independently of the lipid content of the growth medium, (2) is not suppressed by adding 25-hydroxycholesterol, which blocks MHG-CoA reductase activity, and (3) requires a functional Ah receptor and unimpaired nuclear translocation of the receptor. It is possible that an unknown metabolite (or metabolites) of mevinolin activates Cyp1a-1 expression and that high concentrations of mevalonate act via the same mechanism. Using chimaeric plasmids that contain different lengths of Cyp1a-1 5' flanking regions fused to the bacterial neomycin (neo) gene, we find that the mevinolin effect on Cyp1a-1 induction requires the 5' flanking sequences between -1647 and -824, which are also needed for TCDD induction. Mevinolin, however, is not a ligand for the Ah receptor. Gel mobility shift assays revealed that Cyp1a-1 activation caused by mevinolin does not involve the ligand-dependent formation of a functional Ah receptor-dependent DNA-binding complex, but instead appears to be correlated with release of a putative repressor from its cognate DNA site. Our results suggest that the basel level of Cyp1a-1 transcription is maintained by an unknown negative regulatory factor. We propose that Cyp1a-1 transcriptional activation can result not only from induction by polycyclic aromatic compounds but also from derepression by mevinolin, independent of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W1481734963,"The actin-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase activity of Acanthamoeba myosin I depends on phosphorylation of its single heavy chain. The activity of the myosin I heavy chain kinase is increased about 50-fold by autophosphorylation, and the rate of kinase autophosphorylation is enhanced about 20-fold by acidic phospholipids independent of the presence of Ca2+ (Brzeska, H., Lynch, T. J., and Korn, E. D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3591-3594). In this paper, we show that chymotryptic digestion of the kinase produces a 54-kDa fragment which contains three to four of the approximately 11 original phosphorylation sites and whose activity is greatly stimulated by autophosphorylation. However, both the rate of autophosphorylation and the kinase activity of the 54-kDa fragment are independent of phospholipid and comparable to those of intact kinase in the presence of phospholipid. These data imply that the (probably NH2-terminal) region(s) removed by proteolysis is necessary for phospholipid-sensitive inhibition of autophosphorylation of sites residing within the (probably COOH-terminal) 54-kDa fragment. The 54-kDa fragment contains the catalytic site of the kinase as well as three to four sites whose phosphorylation is necessary for full expression of kinase activity. The middle region of the kinase molecule contains proline-rich regions that are similar to the COOH-terminal tail of the kinase substrate, Acanthamoeba myosin I."

An alteration in elution of one of the five ATPases, designated DNA-dependent ATPase Q1, was observed with a cell line of complementation group C. This alteration was observed with all tested cell lines that belonged to group C.

https://openalex.org/W1586364041,"The O2-. production by aerobically cultured Escherichia coli in the presence of benzofurazan (1), 4,7-dimethylbenzofurazan (2), 4,7-dibromobenzofurazan (3), 4-bromo-6-cyanobenzofurazan (4), and 4,7-dicyanobenzofurazan (5) was examined by using the cytochrome c reduction method in order to elucidate the mechanism of cytotoxicity of benzofurazans. Adding compound 5 to E. coli cell suspension caused cytochrome c reduction, which was completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase. The rate of cytochrome c reduction was in the order of 1 = 2 = 3 less than 4 less than 5, which correlates well with that of the reduction potentials of these benzofurazans. Adding glucose to the E. coli cell suspension-compound 5-cytochrome c system accelerated the rate of cytochrome c reduction. The formation of 4,7-dicyanobenzofurazan anion radical in the cell suspension-compound 5-glucose system in the absence of O2 was followed by ESR spectroscopy. The ESR signal of the anion radical disappeared when O2 was added. Compound 5 was shown to have an approximately 10-fold greater increasing effect on the flux of O2-. by E. coli than paraquat (PQ) by the cytochrome c reduction method. The results were confirmed by the electrochemical method with an oxygen electrode. However, compound 5 had a bacteriostatic, but not lethal, effect, while PQ had both effects. The effect of compound 5 and PQ on lethality of E. coli showed a dramatic difference when E. coli was exposed to these two compounds and washed prior to testing the effects of that exposure. This difference probably arose because compound 5 readily leaked from the cells during dilution and plating. Also, the reduced form of compound 5 exits from the cells more readily than the reduced form of PQ and then generates O2-. in the medium by autoxidation. This suggests the importance of the intracellular production of O2-., rather than the extracellular production of O2-., for lethal effect."
https://openalex.org/W1513249165,"To examine the regulatory function of the src-related SH2 and SH3 (SH2/SH3) region of phospholipase C-gamma 2 (PLC-gamma 2), we expressed this region of rat PLC-gamma 2 cDNA in rat 3Y1 fibroblasts and isolated and characterized a number of clones (approximately 20 clones). An increase of endogenous tyrosine kinase activity was observed in all cell clones that highly expressed a translational product of the SH2/SH3 domain. Moreover, endogenous phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolyzing activity was also enhanced in these clones, and PLC-gamma 1 seemed to be preferentially activated among endogenous PLC isozymes. Genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, inhibited this activation of PLC-gamma 1, and tyrosine phosphorylation was observed on PLC-gamma 1 molecules, indicating the involvement of tyrosine kinases in the PLC-gamma 1 activation. These results suggest that the SH2/SH3 region of PLC-gamma would function as a multidirectional regulator which controls at least two major signaling pathways: tyrosine kinase and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1576902094,"In our previous study, we identified four chromatographically distinct DNA-dependent ATPases, B, C1, C2, and C3, in mouse FM3A cells (Tawaragi, Y., Enomoto, T., Watanabe, Y., Hanaoka, F., and Yamada, M. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 529-533). The DNA-dependent ATPase C1 has been purified and characterized in detail. A divalent cation and a polynucleotide cofactor were required for the ATPase activity. Poly(dT), single-stranded circular DNA, and heat-denatured DNA were very effective. Almost no ATPase activity was observed with S1 nuclease-treated native DNA. ATPase C1 hydrolyzed ATP only among the ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates tested, and this fact distinguished ATPase C1 from ATPases B, C2, and C3, because the latter enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing both ATP and dATP. The purified DNA-dependent ATPase C1 fraction was shown to have a DNA helicase activity that was dependent on hydrolysis of ATP. The helicase activity and DNA-dependent ATPase activity cosedimented at 5.2 S on glycerol gradient centrifugation. Both activities showed similar preferences for nucleoside 5'-triphosphates and similar requirements for divalent cations. The DNA helicase activity was inhibited by the addition of single-stranded DNAs that served as cofactor for the ATPase activity. The efficiency of a single-stranded DNA to inhibit DNA helicase activity correlated well with the capacity of the DNA to serve as cofactor for DNA-dependent ATPase activity. The helicase was shown to migrate along the DNA strand in the 5' to 3' direction, which is the same direction of migration of the mouse DNA helicase B (Seki, M., Enomoto, T., Yanagisawa, J., Hanaoka, F., and Ui, M. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 1766-1771)."

Analysis of the Scatchard plot of these data indicates a single, low affinity Ca(II)-binding site to be present. Similar results were obtained from studies on the decarboxylated fragment 1 derivative, 10-gamma-MGlu-fragment 1. Acetylation of bovine fragment 1 in the absence of Ca(II) or Mg(II) ions results in the loss of the metal ion-promoted quenching of the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of the protein and the Ca(II)-mediated binding to phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine (PS/PC) vesicles. The acetylation of the NH2 alpha-group of Ala-1 has been shown (Welsch, D. J., and Nelsestuen, G. L. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 4946-4952) to abolish the PS/PC binding property of fragment 1. The present study demonstrates that acetylation of a second site possibly Ser-79 or Thr-81 using the conditions described in the preceding paper results in loss of both the fluorescence transition and the Ca(II)-mediated PS/PC binding of the resulting protein derivative. Removal of the O-acetyl group at the Ser-79/Thr-81 site is accomplished by aminolysis with 0.2 M hydroxylamine, pH 10, 50 degrees C; the fluorescence transition is partially restored. PS/PC binding is partially restored if the NH2 alpha-group of Ala-1 is trinitrophenylated but is not restored if the NH2 alpha-group of Ala-1 is acetylated. We conclude that the Ser-79/Thr-81 site may represent a portion of the metal ion-binding site within the kringle domain of fragment 1. Occupancy of this site by a Ca(II) ion appears to be important in the binding of the protein to PS/PC vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1549024283,"Inhibitory effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on T lymphocyte function have been linked to perturbation of signaling through the T cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex. Comparative biochemical analyses of signaling responses were performed in T cells that were either uninfected or chronically infected with the HIV-1/IIIB strain. Stimulation with antibodies to CD3 triggered both Ca2+ accumulation and phosphoinositide hydrolysis responses that were equivalent in uninfected and infected cells. Treatment with anti-CD3 or with phorbol diester also stimulated serine phosphorylation of CD4 molecules in uninfected T cells. However, phosphorylation of CD4 was not observed after anti-CD3 treatment in HIV-infected T cells despite normal phosphorylation responses to phorbol diester. Identical results were obtained using a T cell line that was infected with an env (gp160/120-) HIV-1 defective variant. These studies indicate that infection with HIV-1 inhibits the activation of protein kinase associated with the T cell receptor-CD3 complex by a mechanism which is independent of viral env protein components."
https://openalex.org/W1536543092,"Human B lymphoblast lines severely deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) were selected for resistance to 6-thioguanine from cloned normal and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-Rib-P) synthetase-superactive cell lines and were compared with their respective parental cell lines with regard to growth and PP-Rib-P and purine nucleotide metabolism. During blockade of purine synthesis de novo with 6-methylthioinosine or aminopterin, inhibition of growth of all HGPRT-deficient cell lines was refractory to addition of Ade at concentrations which restored substantial growth to parental cell lines. Ade-resistant inhibition of growth of parental lines by 6-methylthioinosine, however, occurred during Ado deaminase inhibition. Insufficient generation of IMP (and ultimately guanylates) to support growth of lymphoblasts lacking HGPRT activity and blocked in purine synthesis de novo best explained these findings, implying that a major route of interconversion of AMP to IMP involves the reaction sequence: AMP----Ado----Ino----Hyp----IMP. PP-Rib-P generation and purine nucleoside triphosphate pools were unchanged by introduction of HGPRT deficiency into normal lymphoblast lines, in agreement with the view that accelerated purine synthesis de novo in this deficiency results from increased availability of PP-Rib-P for the pathway. Cell lines with dual enzyme defects did not differ from PP-Rib-P synthetase-superactive parental lines in rates of PP-Rib-P and purine synthesis despite 5-6-fold increases in PP-Rib-P concentrations, excretion of nearly 50% of newly synthesized purines, and diminished GTP concentrations. Fixed rates of purine synthesis de novo in PP-Rib-P synthetase-superactive cells appeared to reflect saturation of the rate-limiting amidophosphoribosyltransferase reaction for PP-Rib-P. In combination with accelerated purine excretion, increased channeling of newly formed purines into adenylates, and impaired conversion of AMP to IMP, fixed rates of purine synthesis de novo may condition cell lines with defects in HGPRT and PP-Rib-P synthetase to depletion of GTP with consequent growth retardation."
