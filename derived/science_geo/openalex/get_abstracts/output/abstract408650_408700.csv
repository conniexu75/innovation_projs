AhR activity can be regulated by dietary components, such as those present in cruciferous vegetables, providing a mechanistic link between dietary compounds, the intestinal immune system, and the microbiota. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) reside at epithelial barriers (skin and intestine) IELs express high levels of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) AhR activity is required cell autonomously for the maintenance of IELs AhR activity can be regulated by dietary compounds, found mainly in vegetables Our surfaces are colonized with a large variety of microorganisms. In the intestine, many of these aid in nutrient processing, immunity, tissue development, and provision of metabolic compounds. Although many microorganisms are beneficial, the tissues need protection against assault from these and others. A first line of defense is the physical obstruction provided by a single- or multi-cell layer, the epithelial barrier. In the skin this is a tight, although not impregnable, seal. In contrast, the epithelial cells of the intestine form leaky barriers required for supporting the exchange of nutrients and fluids. Underneath the epithelial barrier there is a network of immune cells, predominantly consisting of specialized intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). IELs are comprised of a distinct population of T cell receptor (TCR)γδ cells in the skin and TCRγδ and TCRαβCD8αα+ cells in the gut. They populate these sites before birth in preparation for subsequent colonization with microorganisms (Carding et al., 1990Carding S.R. Kyes S. Jenkinson E.J. Kingston R. Bottomly K. Owen J.J. Hayday A.C. Developmentally regulated fetal thymic and extrathymic T-cell receptor gamma delta gene expression.Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1304-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We recently reported the induced expression of the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in differentiated TCRαβ+CD4+ T helper (Th) 17 cells (Veldhoen et al., 2008Veldhoen M. Hirota K. Westendorf A.M. Buer J. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.C. Stockinger B. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor links TH17-cell-mediated autoimmunity to environmental toxins.Nature. 2008; 453: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), which is mirrored in populations of CD44hiCCR6+ TCRγδ T cells found in secondary lymphoid organs (Martin et al., 2009Martin B. Hirota K. Cua D.J. Stockinger B. Veldhoen M. Interleukin-17-producing gammadelta T cells selectively expand in response to pathogen products and environmental signals.Immunity. 2009; 31: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). However, specialized TCRγδ T cells found at epithelial sites, which predominantly display an alert phenotype without full activation (CD44intCD25−CD69+CCR6−), were not analyzed. In this study, we sought to determine whether these IELs express Th17-related factors that may play a role in barrier immunity. We report here that IELs express high levels of the AhR. Although the absence of AhR has no effect on the number or composition of general lymphoid cell populations, IELs have an intrinsic requirement for AhR activity. In the absence of AhR, IELs are not impaired in their ability to develop, home to their target organ, or proliferate. However, they are no longer maintained at the epithelial sites, in both the skin and the intestine. We reveal that intestinal AhR ligands are predominantly diet derived, with high levels present in cruciferous vegetables. The absence of AhR activation reduces epithelial cell turnover and the ability to control the microbial load and composition. As a consequence of low AhR activity, the intestine is in a heightened state of immune activation, dominated by a type 1 response, and more susceptible to immunopathology. IELs expressing an invariant TCR consisting of TCRVγ3 and TCRVδ1 receptor chains (see Garman et al., 1986Garman R.D. Doherty P.J. Raulet D.H. Diversity, rearrangement, and expression of murine T cell gamma genes.Cell. 1986; 45: 733-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar for nomenclature) are among the first wave of T lymphocytes to mature in the embryonic thymus and populate the epidermis during keratinocyte stratification. By contrast, intestinal TCRγδ+ cells develop in the thymus as well as extrathymically and mainly express TCRVγ5 determinants that can pair with multiple TCRVδ chains (Rocha et al., 1994Rocha B. Vassalli P. Guy-Grand D. Thymic and extrathymic origins of gut intraepithelial lymphocyte populations in mice.J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We compared the gene expression profiles of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted skin-derived TCRVγ3, intestinal TCRVγ5, and lymph node-sourced populations of TCRVγ1.1 and TCRVγ2 cells from nonimmune mice housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. We note a high basal ex vivo expression of AhR in both IEL subsets without additional cell activation. AhR expression significantly exceeded that found in TCRVγ2 and TCRVγ1.1 cell populations (which contain both naive and previously activated cells) (Figure 1A ), differentiated Th17 cells, and hepatocytes (Veldhoen et al., 2008Veldhoen M. Hirota K. Westendorf A.M. Buer J. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.C. Stockinger B. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor links TH17-cell-mediated autoimmunity to environmental toxins.Nature. 2008; 453: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with an earlier study that noted differential expression of AhR in intestinal IELs compared with lymph node-sourced TCRαβ+CD8αβ+ T cells as well as intestinal epithelial cells (Fahrer et al., 2001Fahrer A.M. Konigshofer Y. Kerr E.M. Ghandour G. Mack D.H. Davis M.M. Chien Y.H. Attributes of gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes as suggested by their transcriptional profile.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 10261-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We confirmed that expression of the Th17 cell transcriptional regulator, the orphan nuclear receptor RORγt, was enriched in TCRVγ2+ cells (Martin et al., 2009Martin B. Hirota K. Cua D.J. Stockinger B. Veldhoen M. Interleukin-17-producing gammadelta T cells selectively expand in response to pathogen products and environmental signals.Immunity. 2009; 31: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar), whereas all TCRγδ subsets expressed the closely related factor RORα (Figure 1A). Other mRNA levels for relevant Th transcription factors are tabulated (Figure 1C; Figure S1A available online).Figure S1Profiles and Tissue Distribution of TCRγδ Subpopulations, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Relative mRNA transcript levels of indicated genes in TCRγδ subpopulations.(B and C) representative cytokine expression profiles determined via intracellular staining for indicated cytokines in skin (n > 8) (B) and small intestine (n = 6) (C).(D) The proportional distribution of TCRγδ T cell subpopulations identified by their TCRVγ usage present in indicated tissues in control (upper panels) and AhR-deficient (lower panels) mice analyzed by FACS (n = 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) (A) Relative mRNA transcript levels of indicated genes in TCRγδ subpopulations.

(D) The proportional distribution of TCRγδ T cell subpopulations identified by their TCRVγ usage present in indicated tissues in control (upper panels) and AhR-deficient (lower panels) mice analyzed by FACS (n = 8). In confirmation of their state of “alertness” but not full activation, ex vivo interferon (IFN)-γ transcripts were very low in TCRVγ3+ cells (Figures 1B and S1B), and only low amounts could be detected in the TCRVγ5+ intestinal IEL fraction (Figures 1B and S1C). Consistent with the absence of RORγt (Figure 1A), IL-17 transcripts and protein were absent in IELs (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C). This was in stark contrast with TCRγδ cells found in the dermis, which displayed an activated (CD44hiCD25+CCR6+) phenotype and of which up to 50% readily produced IL-17 (Figure S1B). Despite high basal levels of AhR transcripts, no IL-22 transcripts or protein could be detected in ex vivo TCRVγ3+ and TCRVγ5+ cells (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C), concordant with our earlier finding that AhR may be required but alone is not sufficient for IL-22 production (Veldhoen et al., 2009Veldhoen M. Hirota K. Christensen J. O'Garra A. Stockinger B. Natural agonists for aryl hydrocarbon receptor in culture medium are essential for optimal differentiation of Th17 T cells.J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The basal expression of AhR in IEL populations led us to explore the consequences of the loss of AhR. Mice deficient in one or both AhR alleles showed no significant changes in the proportions or numbers of TCRγδ T cell subsets in lymph nodes, spleen, or thymus (Figures 2A, 2C , and S1D). However, there was a striking loss of over 95% of TCRγδ cells in the small intestine in the absence of AhR compared with controls, without bias toward Thy1 expression levels (Figures 2A, 2C, and 2F). Furthermore, skin isolates from AhR-deficient mice, containing both dermis and epidermis, showed a distinctly different TCRγδ profile with the absence of TCRγδhi cells (see arrow, Figure 2A). TCRVγ3-specific staining positively identified these cells, highlighting the absence of this epidermis-specific subset in AhR-deficient mice (Figures 2B, 2D, and 2G). Numbers of CD4+ and CD8αβ+TCRαβ+ T cells were similar in both mouse strains (Figures S2A and S2B ), as previously reported (Schmidt et al., 1996Schmidt J.V. Su G.H. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Characterization of a murine Ahr null allele: involvement of the Ah receptor in hepatic growth and development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). However, TCRαβ+CD8αα+ T cells, the other major population of intestinal IELs with elevated AhR expression (Figure S2C), are also significantly reduced in AhR-deficient mice (Figures 2E and S2D). By contrast, the proportions (and numbers) of regulatory T cells (Tregs), CD4+ lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi)-like cells, or natural killer (NK) p46+ NK-like cells in the lamina propria (LP) of the intestine or spleen were not significantly altered in AhR-deficient mice compared with controls (Figures S2E–S2G). Although the absence of TCRVγ3+ cells in AhR-deficient mice dramatically changed the proportional representation of TCRγδ T cells in the skin, in the intestine the relative distribution of TCRVγ chains followed that of control mice, dominated by TCRVγ5+ IELs (Figure S1D). In situ staining for TCRγδ confirmed these findings and illustrates the close spatial relationship of IELs with epithelial cells in the intestine and the dense network of cells in the epidermis (Figures 2F and 2G).Figure S2Non-IEL Lymphocyte Numbers Are Maintained Independently of AhR Expression, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A, B, and D) Absolute numbers of lymphocytes in indicated tissues, TCRαβ+CD4+ (A) and TCRαβ+CD8αβ+ (B) and TCRαβ+CD8αα+ (D) in mice homozygous or heterozygous deficient for AhR or controls (n = 8).(C) mRNA expression quantified by qPCR of AhR in small intestinal FACS-purified TCRαβ+CD8αα+ and TCRVγ5+ T cells (n = 3).(E and F) Proportional representation of Tregs (Foxp3+ cells of total CD4+ T cells), NKp46+, and CD4+ LTi-like cells in the LP lymphocyte population of the small intestine (E) or spleen (F) of control and AhR-deficient mice as determined by FACS.

AhR deficiency has been linked with altered development of peripheral lymphocytes in one of the three differently gene-targeted AhR-deficient mouse strains, albeit not in the other two (Lahvis and Bradfield, 1998Lahvis G.P. Bradfield C.A. Ahr null alleles: distinctive or different?.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, Schmidt et al., 1996Schmidt J.V. Su G.H. Reddy J.K.

USA. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exposure to the nonbiodegradable AhR ligand 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) may contribute to thymic involution (Knutson and Poland, 1982Knutson J.C. Poland A. Response of murine epidermis to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin: interaction of the ah and hr loci.Cell. 1982; 30: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the selective reduction in IELs observed in AhR-deficient hosts could have a developmental origin. However, we did not observe proportional or numerical differences of TCRVγ3 cells in the embryonic thymus between AhR-sufficient and -deficient mice (Figure S3A ). In addition, even if TCRVγ3 cells are reduced to 10% of fetal thymocytes, they still predominate in the adult epidermis (Xiong et al., 2002Xiong N. Kang C. Raulet D.H. Redundant and unique roles of two enhancer elements in the TCRgamma locus in gene regulation and gammadelta T cell development.Immunity. 2002; 16: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TCRVγ3+ T cells did home to the skin in the absence of AhR, as they were detectable in neonates and 5-week-old mice, but they were lost over time (Figures S3B, S3C, 2A, and 2G). We did not encounter TCRVγ3+ cells at other anatomical sites examined, including the dermis and peritoneum, excluding aberrant homing properties in the absence of AhR. TCRVγ5+ T cells, which can be generated in the adult thymus, could also be detected in the adult thymus as well as in peripheral lymphoid organs of AhR-deficient mice, in ratios and absolute numbers similar to those of control mice (Figure S1D and data not shown). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the generation and migration of epithelial TCRγδ T cell subsets proceeds similarly in AhR-deficient hosts compared to controls, but that their maintenance at mucosal sites is compromised in the absence of AhR-dependent signals. As AhR is expressed in many tissues, we determined whether IEL-intrinsic or -extrinsic mechanisms were responsible for the specific reduction in IELs. Adoptive transfers of FACS-purified AhR-sufficient TCRγδ T cells, from secondary lymphoid organs or intestine, only effectively reconstituted in the small intestinal epithelia of AhR-deficient but not control mice (data not shown). This is consistent with the absence of an endogenous IEL population in AhR-deficient mice, providing a niche for the transferred cells. Chimeras generated by transfer of bone marrow cells from control mice reconstituted the intestinal IEL populations in recombinase-activated gene (Rag) 1-deficient hosts even when the hosts were Rag1 and AhR double-deficient (Figures S3D and S3E). Although AhR-deficient bone marrow successfully reconstituted secondary lymphoid organs as well as TCRαβ+ cells in organs such as liver and intestine (data not shown), it failed to reconstitute intestinal IELs (Figure S3D). To distinguish between potential AhR-dependent activity in bone marrow-derived lymphoid or accessory cells, we made use of mice with a floxed AhR allele (Walisser et al., 2005Walisser J.A. Glover E. Pande K. Liss A.L. Bradfield C.A. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-dependent liver development and hepatotoxicity are mediated by different cell types.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 17858-17863Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and introduced Cre recombinase under the promoter of the Rag1 gene, allowing lymphocyte-specific deletion of AhR. In these mice, the defect in intestinal IELs (Figure 3A ) and TCRVγ3 (TCRγδhiCCR6−) cells in the skin was recapitulated (Figure 3B) and indistinguishable from that in germline AhR-deficient mice (Figure 2). The collective data obtained support the view that the maintenance of IELs depends critically on T cell-intrinsic AhR activity. AhR-derived signals have been suggested to modulate a broad array of genes, including factors that play a role in cell-cycle regulation and cell death (Boitano et al., 2010Boitano A.E. Wang J. Romeo R. Bouchez L.C. Parker A.E. Sutton S.E. Walker J.R. Flaveny C.A. Perdew G.H. Denison M.S. et al.Aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonists promote the expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells.Science. 2010; 329: 1345-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, Marlowe and Puga, 2005Marlowe J.L. Puga A. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor, cell cycle regulation, toxicity, and tumorigenesis.J. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 96: 1174-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To investigate the contribution of AhR-dependent proliferative and cell survival signals in IELs, we assessed their proliferative capacity by incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) in vivo. Two days of EdU administration showed a significantly increased proliferative capacity of AhR-deficient IELs compared with controls (Figures 3C and S3F). However, 4 days of administration resulted in a similar proportion of IELs that incorporated EdU in both groups of mice. Furthermore, termination of EdU administration resulted in a rapid contraction of EdU+ IELs in AhR-deficient mice compared with controls (Figures 3C and S3F). These results indicate that the proliferative capacity of IELs is not affected by the absence of AhR, but that their reduced survival potential is the likely cause of their diminished numeric presence. AhR contains two highly conserved, period clock-AhR nuclear transporter (Arnt)-single-minded (PAS) domains. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that PAS domain-containing proteins have primarily evolved to respond to environmental changes in energy (Taylor and Zhulin, 1999Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. PAS domains: internal sensors of oxygen, redox potential, and light.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PAS domains in AhR/Arnt closely resemble those present in photoactive yellow protein (PYP) (Pellequer et al., 1998Pellequer J.L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Photoactive yellow protein: a structural prototype for the three-dimensional fold of the PAS domain superfamily.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Analogous to PYP, AhR is responsive to the tryptophan photoproducts 6-formylindolo [3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ) and 6,12-diformylindolo[3,2-b] carbazole (dFICZ) (Oberg et al., 2005Oberg M. Bergander L. Håkansson H. Rannug U. Rannug A. Identification of the tryptophan photoproduct 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole, in cell culture medium, as a factor that controls the background aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity.Toxicol. Sci. 2005; 85: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and AhR-dependent Cyp1a1 expression can be found in the skin in the absence of exogenous xenobiotics (Sadek and Allen-Hoffmann, 1994Sadek C.M. Allen-Hoffmann B.L. Cytochrome P450IA1 is rapidly induced in normal human keratinocytes in the absence of xenobiotics.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16067-16074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the equivalent to mouse TCRVγ3 IELs are not present in humans due to the absence of skint1(Boyden et al., 2008Boyden L.M. Lewis J.M. Barbee S.D. Bas A. Girardi M. Hayday A.C. Tigelaar R.E. Lifton R.P. Skint1, the prototype of a newly identified immunoglobulin superfamily gene cluster, positively selects epidermal gammadelta T cells.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and further studies were concentrated on intestinal IELs. Expression of the AhR target gene Cyp1a1 in the intestine has been shown to depend directly on dietary AhR ligands (Ito et al., 2007Ito S. Chen C. Satoh J. Yim S. Gonzalez F.J. Dietary phytochemicals regulate whole-body CYP1A1 expression through an arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-dependent system in gut.J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1940-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed AhR-dependent Cyp1a1 expression (Figure 4A ). The chemical complexity of the diet makes it difficult to determine the exact nature of all potential AhR ligands. However, the tryptophan-derived phytochemical I3C, found in cruciferous vegetables, can be converted into the high-affinity AhR ligands indolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ICZ) and 3,3-diindolylmethane (DIM) (Bjeldanes et al., 1991Bjeldanes L.F. Kim J.Y. Grose K.R. Bartholomew J.C. Bradfield C.A. Aromatic hydrocarbon responsiveness-receptor agonists generated from indole-3-carbinol in vitro and in vivo: comparisons with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 9543-9547Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate a dietary source of AhR ligands, we fed control C57BL/6 mice either standard diet (5021-3 Autoclavable Rodent Lab Diet) or a synthetic purified diet (AIN-76A Purified Rodent Diet). Exposure of control mice for 3 weeks to the purified synthetic diet significantly reduced Cyp1a1 expression in the ileum compared to standard diet (Figure 4A). Supplementation of AIN-76A with 200 ppm I3C was able to induce a higher level of Cyp1a1 transcripts than our standard diet (Figure 4A). In line with our hypothesis that AhR expression is required for maintaining IELs, we found a significant decrease in both TCRγδ+ and TCRαβ+CD8αα+ IELs in the small intestine of mice fed with synthetic diet compared with standard diet (Figures 4B and S4A). Supplementing the same synthetic diet with only the AhR ligand precursor I3C restored both TCRγδ and TCRαβCD8αα IELs to levels comparable to those with the standard diet (Figures 4B and S4A). IELs share many properties with conventional TCRαβ T cells (Fahrer et al., 2001Fahrer A.M. Konigshofer Y. Kerr E.M. Ghandour G. Mack D.H. Davis M.M. Chien Y.H. Attributes of gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes as suggested by their transcriptional profile.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 10261-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which suggests a degree of overlap in their functional properties. Two crucial differences are the capacity of IELs to respond swiftly, without the need for clonal expansion or priming, and their crosstalk with cells that make up the epithelial barriers. Consistent with the reduction of IELs in AhR-deficient mice, intestinal epithelial turnover was reduced compared with control mice (Figure S4B ) (Boismenu and Havran, 1994Boismenu R. Havran W.L. Modulation of epithelial cell growth by intraepithelial gamma delta T cells.Science. 1994; 266: 1253-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, Komano et al., 1995Komano H. Fujiura Y.

Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 6147-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In line with this, adoptive transfer of AhR-sufficient intestinal TCRγδ+ lymphocytes into AhR-deficient recipients restored epithelial cell proliferation to a level seen in control mice. TCRγδ deficiency can result in more robust development of host immunity, often accompanied by increased immune pathology, implicating IELs in tolerance (Girardi et al., 2003Girardi M. Glusac E.

In our colony of AhR-deficient mice bred under SPF conditions, we see no overt signs of ill health, but transfer of such mice to a less controlled environment increases the occurrence of rectal prolapse and signs of colitis in aging mice and of deaths in young mice due to severe ileitis. Other AhR-deficient colonies, experiencing different environments, were reported to suffer from skin abnormalities, rectal prolapse, and premature deaths (Fernandez-Salguero et al., 1995Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S. Kimura S. Nebert D.W. Rudikoff S. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J.

Med. 2009; 206: 2027-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the reduction in IELs could result in bacterial translocation into the sterile tissues due to increased barrier permeability, but we did not detect any bacteria in the colon-draining mesenteric lymph node, nor did we observe an increase in serum levels of LPS-binding protein (LBP) or increased intestinal permeability in healthy, AhR-deficient mice compared with controls after dextran-FITC feeding (Figure S4C and data not shown). Histological analyses of the small intestine did not reveal intestinal damage but did highlight increased villus length, epithelial cell size, and apical cytoplasmic mucin distention in AhR-deficient mice compared with controls (Figure S4D). This observation may be the result of decreased epithelial cell turnover in AhR-deficient mice and may contribute toward maintaining barrier integrity in the absence of IELs. IELs are directly involved in immune surveillance, inducing apoptosis in infected cells via expression of high levels of granzymes (Fahrer et al., 2001Fahrer A.M. Konigshofer Y. Kerr E.M. Ghandour G. Mack D.H. Davis M.M. Chien Y.H. Attributes of gammadelta intraepithelial lymphocytes as suggested by their transcriptional profile.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 10261-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In line with the significant reduction of IELs in mice with reduced AhR stimulation, we detected significantly lower levels of granzyme A and B expression in the small intestine compared with control mice and those on a synthetic diet supplemented with I3C (Figure 4C and data not shown).

We report in an emphysema model of mice chronically exposed to tobacco smoke that pulmonary vascular dysfunction, vascular remodeling, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) precede development of alveolar destruction. We provide evidence for a causative role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and peroxynitrite in this context. Mice lacking iNOS were protected against emphysema and PH. Treatment of wild-type mice with the iNOS inhibitor N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)-L-lysine (L-NIL) prevented structural and functional alterations of both the lung vasculature and alveoli and also reversed established disease. In chimeric mice lacking iNOS in bone marrow (BM)-derived cells, PH was dependent on iNOS from BM-derived cells, whereas emphysema development was dependent on iNOS from non-BM-derived cells. Similar regulatory and structural alterations as seen in mouse lungs were found in lung tissue from humans with end-stage COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2081781003,"Type I interferons (IFN) comprise a family of cytokines that signal through a common cellular receptor to induce a plethora of genes with antiviral and other activities. Recombinant IFNs are used for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, multiple sclerosis, and certain malignancies. The capability of type I IFN to suppress virus replication and resultant cytopathic effects is frequently used to measure their bioactivity. However, these assays are time-consuming and require appropriate biosafety containment. In this study, an improved IFN assay is presented which is based on a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replicon encoding two reporter proteins, firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein. The vector lacks the essential envelope glycoprotein (G) gene of VSV and is propagated on a G protein-expressing transgenic cell line. Several mammalian and avian cells turned out to be susceptible to infection with the complemented replicon particles. Infected cells readily expressed the reporter proteins at high levels five hours post infection. When human fibroblasts were treated with serial dilutions of human IFN-β prior to infection, reporter expression was accordingly suppressed. This method was more sensitive and faster than a classical IFN bioassay based on VSV cytopathic effects. In addition, the antiviral activity of human IFN-λ (interleukin-29), a type III IFN, was determined on Calu-3 cells. Both IFN-β and IFN-λ were acid-stable, but only IFN-β was resistant to alkaline treatment. The antiviral activities of canine, porcine, and avian type I IFN were analysed with cell lines derived from the corresponding species. This safe bioassay will be useful for the rapid and sensitive quantification of multi-species type I IFN and potentially other antiviral cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W2169379210,"Large-scale geographical patterns of biotic specialization and the underlying drivers are poorly understood, but it is widely believed that climate plays an important role in determining specialization. As climate-driven range dynamics should diminish local adaptations and favor generalization, one hypothesis is that contemporary biotic specialization is determined by the degree of past climatic instability, primarily Quaternary climate-change velocity. Other prominent hypotheses predict that either contemporary climate or species richness affect biotic specialization. To gain insight into geographical patterns of contemporary biotic specialization and its drivers, we use network analysis to determine the degree of specialization in plant-hummingbird mutualistic networks sampled at 31 localities, spanning a wide range of climate regimes across the Americas. We found greater biotic specialization at lower latitudes, with latitude explaining 20–22% of the spatial variation in plant-hummingbird specialization. Potential drivers of specialization - contemporary climate, Quaternary climate-change velocity, and species richness - had superior explanatory power, together explaining 53–64% of the variation in specialization. Notably, our data provides empirical evidence for the hypothesized roles of species richness, contemporary precipitation and Quaternary climate-change velocity as key predictors of biotic specialization, whereas contemporary temperature and seasonality seem unimportant in determining specialization. These results suggest that both ecological and evolutionary processes at Quaternary time scales can be important in driving large-scale geographical patterns of contemporary biotic specialization, at least for co-evolved systems such as plant-hummingbird networks."
https://openalex.org/W2151724015,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is caused by the constitutively active tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl and treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib. However, emerging TKI resistance prevents complete cure. Therefore, alternative strategies targeting regulatory modules of Bcr-Abl in addition to the kinase active site are strongly desirable. Here, we show that an intramolecular interaction between the SH2 and kinase domains in Bcr-Abl is both necessary and sufficient for high catalytic activity of the enzyme. Disruption of this interface led to inhibition of downstream events critical for CML signaling and, importantly, completely abolished leukemia formation in mice. Furthermore, disruption of the SH2-kinase interface increased sensitivity of imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl mutants to TKI inhibition. An engineered Abl SH2-binding fibronectin type III monobody inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity both in vitro and in primary CML cells, where it induced apoptosis. This work validates the SH2-kinase interface as an allosteric target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1977895192,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been proposed as a novel neuromodulator and neuroprotective agent. Cobalt chloride (CoCl2) is a well-known hypoxia mimetic agent. We have demonstrated that H2S protects against CoCl2-induced injuries in PC12 cells. However, whether the members of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), in particular, extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2(ERK1/2) and p38MAPK are involved in the neuroprotection of H2S against chemical hypoxia-induced injuries of PC12 cells is not understood. We observed that CoCl2 induced expression of transcriptional factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), decreased cystathionine-β synthase (CBS, a synthase of H2S) expression, and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to injuries of the cells, evidenced by decrease in cell viability, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) , caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, which were attenuated by pretreatment with NaHS (a donor of H2S) or N-acetyl-L cystein (NAC), a ROS scavenger. CoCl2 rapidly activated ERK1/2, p38MAPK and C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Inhibition of ERK1/2 or p38MAPK or JNK with kinase inhibitors (U0126 or SB203580 or SP600125, respectively) or genetic silencing of ERK1/2 or p38MAPK by RNAi (Si-ERK1/2 or Si-p38MAPK) significantly prevented CoCl2-induced injuries. Pretreatment with NaHS or NAC inhibited not only CoCl2-induced ROS production, but also phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK. Thus, we demonstrated that a concurrent activation of ERK1/2, p38MAPK and JNK participates in CoCl2-induced injuries and that H2S protects PC12 cells against chemical hypoxia-induced injuries by inhibition of ROS-activated ERK1/2 and p38MAPK pathways. Our results suggest that inhibitors of ERK1/2, p38MAPK and JNK or antioxidants may be useful for preventing and treating hypoxia-induced neuronal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2103824500,"Cellular abnormalities are not limited to motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). There are numerous observations of astrocyte dysfunction in both humans with ALS and in SOD1(G93A) rodents, a widely studied ALS model. The present study therapeutically targeted astrocyte replacement in this model via transplantation of human Glial-Restricted Progenitors (hGRPs), lineage-restricted progenitors derived from human fetal neural tissue. Our previous findings demonstrated that transplantation of rodent-derived GRPs into cervical spinal cord ventral gray matter (in order to target therapy to diaphragmatic function) resulted in therapeutic efficacy in the SOD1(G93A) rat. Those findings demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of transplantation-based astrocyte replacement for ALS, and also show that targeted multi-segmental cell delivery to cervical spinal cord is a promising therapeutic strategy, particularly because of its relevance to addressing respiratory compromise associated with ALS. The present study investigated the safety and in vivo survival, distribution, differentiation, and potential efficacy of hGRPs in the SOD1(G93A) mouse. hGRP transplants robustly survived and migrated in both gray and white matter and differentiated into astrocytes in SOD1(G93A) mice spinal cord, despite ongoing disease progression. However, cervical spinal cord transplants did not result in motor neuron protection or any therapeutic benefits on functional outcome measures. This study provides an in vivo characterization of this glial progenitor cell and provides a foundation for understanding their capacity for survival, integration within host tissues, differentiation into glial subtypes, migration, and lack of toxicity or tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W2006168684,"Mi(cro)RNAs are small non-coding RNAs of 18-25 nucleotides in length that modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. These RNAs have been shown to be involved in a several biological processes, human diseases and metabolic disorders. Proanthocyanidins, which are the most abundant polyphenol class in the human diet, have positive health effects on a variety of metabolic disorders such as inflammation, obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance. The present study aimed to evaluate whether proanthocyanidin-rich natural extracts modulate miRNA expression. Using microarray analysis and Q-PCR, we investigated miRNA expression in HepG2 cells treated with proanthocyanidins. Our results showed that when HepG2 cells were treated with grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), cocoa proanthocyanidin extract (CPE) or pure epigallocatechin gallate isolated from green tea (EGCG), fifteen, six and five differentially expressed miRNAs, respectively, were identified out of 904 mRNAs. Specifically, miR-30b* was downregulated by the three treatments, and treatment with GSPE or CPE upregulated miR-1224-3p, miR-197 and miR-532-3p. Therefore, these results provide evidence of the capacity of dietary proanthocyanidins to influence microRNA expression, suggesting a new mechanism of action of proanthocyanidins."
https://openalex.org/W2022823589,"Cell penetrating peptides constitute a potent approach to overcome the limitations of in vivo siRNA delivery. We recently proposed a peptide-based nanoparticle system, CADY, for efficient delivery of siRNA into numerous cell lines. CADY is a secondary amphipathic peptide that forms stable complexes with siRNA thereby improving both their cellular uptake and biological response. With the aim of understanding the cellular uptake mechanism of CADY:siRNA complexes, we have combined biochemical, confocal and electron microscopy approaches. In the present work, we provide evidence that the major route for CADY:siRNA cellular uptake involves direct translocation through the membrane but not the endosomal pathway. We have demonstrated that CADY:siRNA complexes do not colocalize with most endosomal markers and remain fully active in the presence of inhibitors of the endosomal pathway. Moreover, neither electrostatic interactions with cell surface heparan sulphates nor membrane potential are essential for CADY:siRNA cell entry. In contrast, we have shown that CADY:siRNA complexes clearly induce a transient cell membrane permeabilization, which is rapidly restored by cell membrane fluidity. Therefore, we propose that direct translocation is the major gate for cell entry of CADY:siRNA complexes. Membrane perturbation and uptake are driven mainly by the ability of CADY to interact with phospholipids within the cell membrane, followed by rapid localization of the complex in the cytoplasm, without affecting cell integrity or viability."
https://openalex.org/W1997643107,"As a newly identified and characterized gene, p42.3 is associated with cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. The expression of p42.3 is upregulated in human gastric cancer (GC), but its underlying mechanisms of action are not well understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play vital regulatory roles in many cellular processes. Here we utilized bioinformatics and experimental approaches to investigate the regulatory relationship between miRNAs and the p42.3 gene. We showed that miR-29a could repress p42.3 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels via directly binding to its 3'UTR. Furthermore, an inverse relationship was observed between miR-29a and p42.3 expression in gastric cancer cell lines and GC tissue samples, especially in cases where p42.3 was downregulated. Taken together, we have elucidated previously unrecognized roles of miR-29a and indicated that miR-29a may function, at least partially, by targeting the p42.3 gene in human GC."
https://openalex.org/W1964305056,"We conducted a metacommunity experiment to investigate the role of dispersal for bacterial community composition (BCC) and function of freshwater bacteria. Bacteria were dispersed from a common source pool into three different lake communities in their natural lake water. The experiment was conducted in dialysis bags to enable a decoupling between a change in the local environment and dispersal. BCC was determined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (tRFLP) of the 16S rRNA gene. We show that the greatest changes in BCC occurred between 10% and 43% of dispersal of standing stock per day. Functioning, measured as growth rate, was also affected by dispersal in all three communities but the qualitative pattern differed between communities, sometimes showing a hump-shaped relationship to dispersal and sometimes decreasing with increasing dispersal. In all waters, functioning was related to BCC. Our results show that dispersal does affect BCC and functioning but that high dispersal rates are needed. Further, the effect of dispersal on BCC and function seem to depend on the quality of the habitat to which bacteria disperse into."
https://openalex.org/W1974108838,"Early land plant mitochondrial genomes captured important changes of mitochondrial genome evolution when plants colonized land. The chondromes of seed plants show several derived characteristics, e.g., large genome size variation, rapid intra-genomic rearrangement, abundant introns, and highly variable levels of RNA editing. On the other hand, the chondromes of charophytic algae are still largely ancestral in these aspects, resembling those of early eukaryotes. When the transition happened has been a long-standing question in studies of mitochondrial genome evolution. Here we report complete mitochondrial genome sequences from an early-diverging liverwort, Treubia lacunosa, and a late-evolving moss, Anomodon rugelii. The two genomes, 151,983 and 104,239 base pairs in size respectively, contain standard sets of protein coding genes for respiration and protein synthesis, as well as nearly full sets of rRNA and tRNA genes found in the chondromes of the liverworts Marchantia polymorpha and Pleurozia purpurea and the moss Physcomitrella patens. The gene orders of these two chondromes are identical to those of the other liverworts and moss. Their intron contents, with all cis-spliced group I or group II introns, are also similar to those in the previously sequenced liverwort and moss chondromes. These five chondromes plus the two from the hornworts Phaeoceros laevis and Megaceros aenigmaticus for the first time allowed comprehensive comparative analyses of structure and organization of mitochondrial genomes both within and across the three major lineages of bryophytes. These analyses led to the conclusion that the mitochondrial genome experienced dynamic evolution in genome size, gene content, intron acquisition, gene order, and RNA editing during the origins of land plants and their major clades. However, evolution of this organellar genome has remained rather conservative since the origin and initial radiation of early land plants, except within vascular plants."
https://openalex.org/W2047270254,"The present study aims at clarifying the nature of the Theory of Mind (ToM) deficits associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). ToM is the ability to attribute mental states such as intentions and beliefs to others in order to understand and predict their behaviour and to behave accordingly. Several neuroimaging studies reported the prefrontal cortices as the brain region underlying a key ToM ability, i.e. the comprehension of social intentions. Dysfunction of the prefrontal cortices in patients with ALS has been indicated by a range of neuroimaging studies. The frontal syndrome that appears to characterize up to 50% of ALS has been noted to be similar to the profile that characterizes patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a neurodegenerative condition characterised by ToM deficits. In the present paper, we hypothesize that the performance of patients with ALS is significantly worse than healthy controls' performance on tasks requiring the comprehension of social contexts, whereas patients' performance is comparable to healthy controls' performance on tasks not requiring the comprehension of social contexts. To this end, we tested 15 patients with ALS with an experimental protocol that distinguishes between private (non-social) intentions and social intentions. The pattern of results followed the experimental hypothesis: the performance of patients with ALS and healthy controls significantly differed on the comprehension of social context only, with an impairment in patients with ALS. Single case analysis confirmed the findings at an individual level. The present study is the first which has examined and compared the understanding of social and non-social contexts in patients with ALS and shown a specific and selective deficit in the former only. The current findings further support the notion of a continuum of cognitive dysfunction ranging from ALS to FTD, with parallel cognitive profiles in both disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2016637438,"Human artificial chromosomes (HACs) have unique characteristics as gene-delivery vectors, including episomal transmission and transfer of multiple, large transgenes. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of HAC vectors for reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Two HAC vectors (iHAC1 and iHAC2) were constructed. Both carried four reprogramming factors, and iHAC2 also encoded a p53-knockdown cassette. iHAC1 partially reprogrammed MEFs, and iHAC2 efficiently reprogrammed MEFs. Global gene expression patterns showed that the iHACs, unlike other vectors, generated relatively uniform iPS cells. Under non-selecting conditions, we established iHAC-free iPS cells by isolating cells that spontaneously lost iHAC2. Analyses of pluripotent markers, teratomas and chimeras confirmed that these iHAC-free iPS cells were pluripotent. Moreover, iHAC-free iPS cells with a re-introduced HAC encoding Herpes Simplex virus thymidine kinase were eliminated by ganciclovir treatment, indicating that the HAC safeguard system functioned in iPS cells. Thus, the HAC vector could generate uniform, integration-free iPS cells with a built-in safeguard system."

Objective To assess whether high dietary GL and GI increase the risk of CVD in men and women. Methods A large prospective cohort study (EPIC-MORGEN) was conducted within the general Dutch population among 8,855 men and 10,753 women, aged 21–64 years at baseline (1993–1997) and free of diabetes and CVD. Dietary intake was assessed with a validated food-frequency questionnaire and GI and GL were calculated using Foster-Powell's international table of GI. Information on morbidity and mortality was obtained through linkage with national registries. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, while adjusting for age, CVD risk factors, and dietary factors. Results During a mean follow-up of 11.9 years, 581 CHD cases and 120 stroke cases occurred among men, and 300 CHD cases and 109 stroke cases occurred among women. In men, GL was associated with an increased CHD risk (adjusted HR per SD increase, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.02–1.35]), while no significant association was found in women (1.09 [0.89–1.33]). GI was not associated with CHD risk in both genders, while it was associated with increased stroke risk in men (1.27 [1.02–1.58]) but not in women (0.96 [0.75–1.22]). Similarly, total carbohydrate intake and starch intake were associated with a higher CHD risk in men (1.23 [1.04–1.46]; and 1.24 [1.07–1.45]), but not in women. Conclusion Among men, high GL and GI, and high carbohydrate and starch intake, were associated with increased risk of CVD."
https://openalex.org/W2005064545,"Background Sexual signals, such as bright plumage coloration in passerine birds, reflect individual quality, and testosterone (T) may play a critical role in maintaining signal honesty. Manipulations of T during molt have yielded mixed effects on passerine plumage color, in most cases delaying molt or leading to production of drab plumage. However, the majority of these studies have been conducted on species that undergo a post-nuptial molt when T is low; the role of T in species that acquire breeding plumage during a pre-nuptial molt remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings We experimentally tested the effects of increased T on plumage color in second-year male red-backed fairy-wrens (Malurus melanocephalus), a species in which after-second-year males undergo a pre-nuptial molt into red/black (carotenoid and melanin-based) plumage and second-year males either assume red/black or brown breeding plumage. T treatment stimulated a rapid and early onset pre-nuptial molt and resulted in red/black plumage acquisition, bill darkening, and growth of the sperm storage organ, but had no effect on body condition or corticosterone concentrations. Control males molted later and assumed brown plumage. T treated males produced feathers with similar but not identical reflectance parameters to those of unmanipulated after-second-year red/black males; while reflectance spectra of red back and black crown feathers were similar, black breast feathers differed in UV chroma, hue and brightness, indicating a potentially age and plumage patch-dependent response to T for melanin- vs. carotenoid-pigmentation. Conclusions/Significance We show that testosterone is the primary mechanism functioning during the pre-nuptial molt to regulate intrasexually variable plumage color and breeding phenotype in male red-backed fairy-wrens. Our results suggest that the effects of T on plumage coloration may vary with timing of molt (pre- vs. post-nuptial), and that the role of T in mediating plumage signal production may differ across age classes, plumage patches, and between pigment-types."
https://openalex.org/W2038384063,"The distribution of weak and strong non-linear feeding interactions (i.e., functional responses) across the links of complex food webs is critically important for their stability. While empirical advances have unravelled constraints on single-prey functional responses, their validity in the context of complex food webs where most predators have multiple prey remain uncertain. In this study, we present conceptual evidence for the invalidity of strictly density-dependent consumption as the null model in multi-prey experiments. Instead, we employ two-prey functional responses parameterised with allometric scaling relationships of the functional response parameters that were derived from a previous single-prey functional response study as novel null models. Our experiments included predators of different sizes from two taxonomical groups (wolf spiders and ground beetles) simultaneously preying on one small and one large prey species. We define compliance with the null model predictions (based on two independent single-prey functional responses) as passive preferences or passive switching, and deviations from the null model as active preferences or active switching. Our results indicate active and passive preferences for the larger prey by predators that are at least twice the size of the larger prey. Moreover, our approach revealed that active preferences increased significantly with the predator-prey body-mass ratio. Together with prior allometric scaling relationships of functional response parameters, this preference allometry may allow estimating the distribution of functional response parameters across the myriads of interactions in natural ecosystems."

Colonization with MRSA predisposes to infection and facilitates transmission of the pathogen; however, available regimens are ineffective at preventing MRSA colonization. Studies of human nasal flora suggest that resident bacteria play a critical role in limiting S. aureus growth, and prompted us to query whether application of commensal resident bacteria could prevent nasal colonization with MRSA. We established a murine model system to study this question, and showed that mice nasally pre-colonized with S. epidermidis became more resistant to colonization with MRSA. Our study suggests that application of commensal bacteria with antibiotics could represent a more effective strategy to prevent MRSA colonization."

The molecule, 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydr- oxystilbene-2-O-β-D-glucoside (TSG), is a potent antioxidant derived from the Chinese herb, Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of TSG against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced apoptosis in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells and the possible mechanisms. Our data demonstrated that TSG significantly reversed the 6-hydroxydopamine-induced decrease in cell viability, prevented 6-hydroxydopamine-induced changes in condensed nuclei and decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, TSG slowed the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, counteracted the overexpression of inducible nitric oxide syntheses as well as neuronal nitric oxide syntheses, and also reduced the level of protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine. These results demonstrate that the protective effects of TSG on rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells are mediated, at least in part, by the ROS-NO pathway. Our results indicate that TSG may be effective in providing protection against neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2107802902,"After infection with Borrelia species, the risk for developing Lyme disease varies significantly between individuals. Recognition of Borrelia by the immune system is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as TLRs. While TLR2 is the main recognition receptor for Borrelia spp., little is known about the role of TLR1 and TLR6, which both can form functionally active heterodimers with TLR2. Here we investigated the recognition of Borrelia by both murine and human TLR1 and TLR6. Peritoneal macrophages from TLR1- and TLR6- gene deficient mice were isolated and exposed to Borrelia. Human PBMCs were stimulated with Borrelia with or without specific TLR1 and TLR6 blocking using specific antibodies. Finally, the functional consequences of TLR polymorphisms on Borrelia-induced cytokine production were assessed. Splenocytes isolated from both TLR1−/− and TLR6−/− mice displayed a distorted Th1/Th2 cytokine balance after stimulation with B.burgdorferi, while no differences in pro-inflammatory cytokine production were observed. In contrast, blockade of TLR1 with specific neutralizing antibodies led to decreased cytokine production by human PBMCs after exposure to B.burgdorferi. Blockade of human TLR6 did not lead to suppression of cytokine production. When PBMCs from healthy individuals bearing polymorphisms in TLR1 were exposed to B.burgdorferi, a remarkably decreased in vitro cytokine production was observed in comparison to wild-type controls. TLR6 polymorphisms lead to a minor modified cytokine production. This study indicates a dominant role for TLR1/TLR2 heterodimers in the induction of the early inflammatory response by Borrelia spirochetes in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2047530325,"4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate (HOG) aldolase is a unique enzyme in the hydroxyproline degradation pathway catalyzing the cleavage of HOG to pyruvate and glyoxylate. Mutations in this enzyme are believed to be associated with the excessive production of oxalate in primary hyperoxaluria type 3 (PH3), although no experimental data is available to support this hypothesis. Moreover, the identity, oligomeric state, enzymatic activity, and crystal structure of human HOGA have not been experimentally determined.In this study human HOGA (hHOGA) was identified by mass spectrometry of the mitochondrial enzyme purified from bovine kidney. hHOGA performs a retro-aldol cleavage reaction reminiscent of the trimeric 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolases. Sequence comparisons, however, show that HOGA is related to the tetrameric, bacterial dihydrodipicolinate synthases, but the reaction direction is reversed. The 1.97 Å resolution crystal structure of hHOGA bound to pyruvate was determined and enabled the modeling of the HOG-Schiff base intermediate and the identification of active site residues. Kinetic analyses of site-directed mutants support the importance of Lys196 as the nucleophile, Tyr168 and Ser77 as components of a proton relay, and Asn78 and Ser198 as unique residues that facilitate substrate binding.The biochemical and structural data presented support that hHOGA utilizes a type I aldolase reaction mechanism, but employs novel residue interactions for substrate binding. A mapping of the PH3 mutations identifies potential rearrangements in either the active site or the tetrameric assembly that would likely cause a loss in activity. Altogether, these data establish a foundation to assess mutant forms of hHOGA and how their activity could be pharmacologically restored."
https://openalex.org/W2009313525,"Repeated acoustic events are ubiquitous temporal features of natural sounds. To reveal the neural representation of the sound repetition rate, a number of electrophysiological studies have been conducted on various mammals and it has been proposed that both the spike-time and firing rate of primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons encode the repetition rate. However, previous studies rarely examined how the experimental animals perceive the difference in the sound repetition rate, and a caveat to these experiments is that they compared physiological data obtained from animals with psychophysical data obtained from humans. In this study, for the first time, we directly investigated acoustic perception and the underlying neural mechanisms in the same experimental animal by examining spike activities in the A1 of free-moving cats while performing a Go/No-go task to discriminate the click-trains at different repetition rates (12.5-200 Hz). As reported by previous studies on passively listening animals, A1 neurons showed both synchronized and non-synchronized responses to the click-trains. We further found that the neural performance estimated from the precise temporal information of synchronized units was good enough to distinguish all 16.7-200 Hz from the 12.5 Hz repetition rate; however, the cats showed declining behavioral performance with the decrease of the target repetition rate, indicating an increase of difficulty in discriminating two slower click-trains. Such behavioral performance was well explained by the firing rate of some synchronized and non-synchronized units. Trial-by-trial analysis indicated that A1 activity was not affected by the cat's judgment of behavioral response. Our results suggest that the main function of A1 is to effectively represent temporal signals using both spike timing and firing rate, while the cats may read out the rate-coding information to perform the task in this experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2038790394,"There is a need to develop a universal vaccine against influenza virus infection to avoid developing new formulations of a seasonal vaccine each year. Many of the vaccine strategies for a universal vaccine target strain-conserved influenza virus proteins, such as the matrix, polymerase, and nucleoproteins, rather than the surface hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. In addition, non-disease-causing viral vectors are a popular choice as a delivery system for the influenza virus antigens. As a proof-of-concept, we have designed a novel influenza virus immunogen based on the NP backbone containing human T cell epitopes for M1, NS1, NP, PB1 and PA proteins (referred as NPmix) as well as a construct containing the conserved regions of influenza virus neuraminidase (N-terminal) and hemagglutinin (C-terminal) (referred as NA-HA). DNA vectors and vaccinia virus recombinants expressing NPmix (WR-NP) or both NPmix plus NA-HA (WR-flu) in the cytosol were tested in a heterologous DNA-prime/vaccinia virus-boost vaccine regimen in mice. We observed an increase in the number of influenza virus-specific IFNγ-secreting splenocytes, composed of populations marked by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells producing IFNγ or TNFα. Upon challenge with influenza virus, the vaccinated mice exhibited decreased viral load in the lungs and a delay in mortality. These findings suggest that DNA prime/poxvirus boost with human multi-epitope recombinant influenza virus proteins is a valid approach for a general T-cell vaccine to protect against influenza virus infection."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells abnormally proliferate and escape apoptosis. Herein, the effects and mechanisms of purified HF on AML cell dysfunction were investigated in AML cell lines defining distinct AML subfamilies and primary AML cells cultured ex vivo.HF inhibited in a time- and concentration-dependent manner the growth of AML cell lines (U937, OCI-AML3, NB4, HL-60) by inducing apoptosis as evidenced by accumulation of sub-G1 population, phosphatidylserine externalization and DNA fragmentation. HF also induced apoptosis in primary AML blasts, whereas normal blood cells were not affected. The apoptotic process in U937 cells was accompanied by downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, upregulation of pro-apoptotic Noxa, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, activation of procaspases and cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP-1. The general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and the caspase-9- and -3-specific inhibitors, but not caspase-8 inhibitor, significantly attenuated apoptosis. HF-mediated apoptosis was associated with dephosphorylation of active Akt1 (at Ser(473)) and Akt1 substrate Bad (at Ser(136)) which activates Bad pro-apoptotic function. HF supppressed the kinase activity of Akt1, and combined treatment with the allosteric Akt1 inhibitor Akt-I-VIII significantly enhanced apoptosis of U937 cells.Our data provide new evidence that HF's pro-apoptotic effect in AML cells involved inhibition of Akt1 signaling, mitochondria and Bcl-2 members dysfunctions, and activation of procaspases -9/-3.

In the present study, we combined computer simulations and the energy landscape analysis of protein kinases to characterize the interplay between oncogenic mutations and locally frustrated sites as important catalysts of allostetric kinase activation. While structurally rigid kinase core constitutes a minimally frustrated hub of the catalytic domain, locally frustrated residue clusters, whose interaction networks are not energetically optimized, are prone to dynamic modulation and could enable allosteric conformational transitions. The results of this study have shown that the energy landscape effect of oncogenic mutations may be allosteric eliciting global changes in the spatial distribution of highly frustrated residues. We have found that mutation-induced allosteric signaling may involve a dynamic coupling between structurally rigid (minimally frustrated) and plastic (locally frustrated) clusters of residues. The presented study has demonstrated that activation cancer mutations may affect the thermodynamic equilibrium between kinase states by allosterically altering the distribution of locally frustrated sites and increasing the local frustration in the inactive form, while eliminating locally frustrated sites and restoring structural rigidity of the active form. The energy landsape analysis of protein kinases and the proposed role of locally frustrated sites in activation mechanisms may have useful implications for bioinformatics-based screening and detection of functional sites critical for allosteric regulation in complex biomolecular systems."
https://openalex.org/W2165448800,"Background Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) metabolizes a range of peptidic substrates and plays a key role in blood pressure regulation and vascular remodeling. Thus, elevated ACE levels may be associated with an increased risk for different cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. Previously, a striking familial elevation in blood ACE was explained by mutations in the ACE juxtamembrane region that enhanced the cleavage-secretion process. Recently, we found a family whose affected members had a 6-fold increase in blood ACE and a Tyr465Asp (Y465D) substitution, distal to the stalk region, in the N domain of ACE. Methodology/Principal Findings HEK and CHO cells expressing mutant (Tyr465Asp) ACE demonstrate a 3- and 8-fold increase, respectively, in the rate of ACE shedding compared to wild-type ACE. Conformational fingerprinting of mutant ACE demonstrated dramatic changes in ACE conformation in several different epitopes of ACE. Cell ELISA carried out on CHO-ACE cells also demonstrated significant changes in local ACE conformation, particularly proximal to the stalk region. However, the cleavage site of the mutant ACE - between Arg1203 and Ser1204 - was the same as that of WT ACE. The Y465D substitution is localized in the interface of the N-domain dimer (from the crystal structure) and abolishes a hydrogen bond between Tyr465 in one monomer and Asp462 in another. Conclusions/Significance The Y465D substitution results in dramatic increase in the rate of ACE shedding and is associated with significant local conformational changes in ACE. These changes could result in increased ACE dimerization and accessibility of the stalk region or the entire sACE, thus increasing the rate of cleavage by the putative ACE secretase (sheddase)."
https://openalex.org/W1999240103,"Sustained exposure of pancreatic β cells to an increase in saturated fatty acids induces pleiotropic effects on β-cell function, including a reduction in stimulus-induced insulin secretion. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic over supply of palmitate upon glucose- and amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS and AASIS, respectively) and autocrine-dependent insulin signalling with particular focus on the importance of ceramide, ERK and CaMKII signalling.GSIS and AASIS were both stimulated by >7-fold resulting in autocrine-dependent activation of protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt). Insulin release was dependent upon nutrient-induced activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as their pharmacological inhibition suppressed GSIS/AASIS significantly. Chronic (48 h, 0.4 mM) palmitate treatment blunted glucose/AA-induced activation of CaMKII and ERK and caused a concomitant reduction (~75%) in GSIS/AASIS and autocrine-dependent activation of PKB. This inhibition could not be attributed to enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid uptake/oxidation or ceramide synthesis, which were unaffected by palmitate. In contrast, diacylglycerol synthesis was elevated suggesting increased palmitate esterification rather than oxidation may contribute to impaired stimulus-secretion coupling. Consistent with this, 2-bromopalmitate, a non-oxidisable palmitate analogue, inhibited GSIS as effectively as palmitate.Our results exclude changes in ceramide content or mitochondrial fatty acid handling as factors initiating palmitate-induced defects in insulin release from MIN6 β cells, but suggest that reduced CaMKII and ERK activation associated with palmitate overload may contribute to impaired stimulus-induced insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2145806986,"Objective To investigate the potentially prognostic value of a resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) with regards to the clinical outcome from vegetative and minimally conscious states (VS and MCS) in terms of survival six months after a brain injury. Methods We quantified a dynamic repertoire of EEG oscillations in resting condition with eyes closed in patients in VS and MCS. The exact composition of EEG oscillations was assessed by analysing the probability-classification of short-term EEG spectral patterns. Results Results demonstrated that (a) the diversity and the variability of EEG for Non-Survivors were significantly lower than for Survivors; and (b) a higher probability of mostly delta and slow-theta oscillations occurring either alone or in combination were found during the first assessment for patients with a bad outcome (i.e., those who died) within six months of an injury compared to patients who survived. At the same time, patients with a good outcome (i.e., those who survived) after six months post-injury had a higher probability of mostly fast-theta and alpha oscillations occurring either alone or in combination during the first assessment when compared to patients who died within six months of an injury. Conclusions Resting state EEGs properly analysed may have a potentially prognostic value with regards to the outcome from VS or MCS in terms of survival six months after a brain injury. Significance This work may have implications for clinical care, rehabilitative programmes and medical–legal decisions for patients with impaired consciousness states after being in a coma due to acute brain injuries."
https://openalex.org/W1964916549,"High-throughput sequencing is now routinely performed in many experiments. But the analysis of the millions of sequences generated, is often beyond the expertise of the wet labs who have no personnel specializing in bioinformatics. Whereas several tools are now available to map high-throughput sequencing data on a genome, few of these can extract biological knowledge from the mapped reads. We have developed a toolbox called S-MART, which handles mapped RNA-Seq data. S-MART is an intuitive and lightweight tool which performs many of the tasks usually required for the analysis of mapped RNA-Seq reads. S-MART does not require any computer science background and thus can be used by all of the biologist community through a graphical interface. S-MART can run on any personal computer, yielding results within an hour even for Gb of data for most queries. S-MART may perform the entire analysis of the mapped reads, without any need for other ad hoc scripts. With this tool, biologists can easily perform most of the analyses on their computer for their RNA-Seq data, from the mapped data to the discovery of important loci."
https://openalex.org/W1972638322,"Strains of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae show enormous genetic heterogeneity and display differential virulence potential in different clinical settings. The igaB gene, which encodes a newly identified IgA protease, is more likely to be present in the genome of COPD strains of H. influenzae than in otitis media strains. Analysis of igaB and surrounding sequences in the present study showed that H. influenzae likely acquired igaB from Neisseria meningitidis and that the acquisition was accompanied by a ∼20 kb genomic inversion that is present only in strains that have igaB. As part of a long running prospective study of COPD, molecular typing of H. influenzae strains identified a clonally related group of strains, a surprising observation given the genetic heterogeneity that characterizes strains of nontypeable H. influenzae. Analysis of strains by 5 independent methods (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, igaB gene sequences, P2 gene sequences, pulsed field gel electrophoresis) established the clonal relationship among the strains. Analysis of 134 independent strains collected prospectively from a cohort of adults with COPD demonstrated that ∼10% belonged to the clonal group. We conclude that a clonally related group of strains of nontypeable H. influenzae that has two IgA1 protease genes (iga and igaB) is adapted for colonization and infection in COPD. This observation has important implications in understanding population dynamics of H. influenzae in human infection and in understanding virulence mechanisms specifically in the setting of COPD."
https://openalex.org/W1974301505,"Background Given the globally poor protection of fresh waters for their intrinsic ecological values, assessments are needed to determine how well fresh waters and supported fish species are incidentally protected within existing terrestrial protected-area networks, and to identify their vulnerability to human-induced disturbances. To date, gaps in data have severely constrained any attempt to explore the representation of fresh waters in tropical regions. Methodology and Results We determined the distribution of fresh waters and fish diversity in the Wet Tropics of Queensland, Australia. We then used distribution data of fresh waters, fish species, human-induced disturbances, and the terrestrial protected-area network to assess the effectiveness of terrestrial protected areas for fresh waters and fish species. We also identified human-induced disturbances likely to influence the effectiveness of freshwater protection and evaluated the vulnerability of fresh waters to these disturbances within and outside protected areas. The representation of fresh waters and fish species in the protected areas of the Wet Tropics is poor: 83% of stream types defined by order, 75% of wetland types, and 89% of fish species have less than 20% of their total Wet Tropics length, area or distribution completely within IUCN category II protected areas. Numerous disturbances affect fresh waters both within and outside of protected areas despite the high level of protection afforded to terrestrial areas in the Wet Tropics (>60% of the region). High-order streams and associated wetlands are influenced by the greatest number of human-induced disturbances and are also the least protected. Thirty-two percent of stream length upstream of protected areas has at least one human-induced disturbance present. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate the need for greater consideration of explicit protection and off-reserve management for fresh waters and supported biodiversity by showing that, even in a region where terrestrial protection is high, it does not adequately capture fresh waters."
https://openalex.org/W2028035045,"Electrotaxis is the movement of adherent living cells in response to a direct current (dc) electric field (EF) of physiological strength. Highly metastatic human lung cancer cells, CL1-5, exhibit directional migration and orientation under dcEFs. To understand the transcriptional response of CL1-5 cells to a dcEF, microarray analysis was performed in this study.A large electric-field chip (LEFC) was designed, fabricated, and used in this study. CL1-5 cells were treated with the EF strength of 0 mV/mm (the control group) and 300 mV/mm (the EF-treated group) for two hours. Signaling pathways involving the genes that expressed differently between the two groups were revealed. It was shown that the EF-regulated genes highly correlated to adherens junction, telomerase RNA component gene regulation, and tight junction. Some up-regulated genes such as ACVR1B and CTTN, and some down-regulated genes such as PTEN, are known to be positively and negatively correlated to cell migration, respectively. The protein-protein interactions of adherens junction-associated EF-regulated genes suggested that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors and ephrin receptors may participate in sensing extracellular electrical stimuli. We further observed a high percentage of significantly regulated genes which encode cell membrane proteins, suggesting that dcEF may directly influence the activity of cell membrane proteins in signal transduction.In this study, some of the EF-regulated genes have been reported to be essential whereas others are novel for electrotaxis. Our result confirms that the regulation of gene expression is involved in the mechanism of electrotactic response."
https://openalex.org/W2092263558,"Secretory Apolipoprotein J/Clusterin (sCLU) is a ubiquitously expressed chaperone that has been functionally implicated in several pathological conditions of increased oxidative injury, including aging. Nevertheless, the biological role of sCLU in red blood cells (RBCs) remained largely unknown. In the current study we identified sCLU as a component of human RBCs and we undertook a detailed analysis of its cellular topology. Moreover, we studied the erythrocytic membrane sCLU content during organismal aging, in conditions of increased organismal stress and accelerated RBCs senescence, as well as during physiological in vivo cellular senescence.By using a combination of molecular, biochemical and high resolution microscopical methods we found that sCLU is a novel structural component of RBCs extra- and intracellular plasma membrane and cytosol. We observed that the RBCs membrane-associated sCLU decreases during organismal aging or exposure to acute stress (e.g. smoking), in patients with congenital hemolytic anemia, as well as during RBCs in vivo senescence. In all cases, sCLU reduction paralleled the expression of typical cellular senescence, redox imbalance and erythrophagocytosis markers which are also indicative of the senescence- and oxidative stress-mediated RBCs membrane vesiculation.We propose that sCLU at the mature RBCs is not a silent remnant of the erythroid precursors, but an active component being functionally implicated in the signalling mechanisms of cellular senescence and oxidative stress-responses in both healthy and diseased organism. The reduced sCLU protein levels in the RBCs membrane following cell exposure to various endogenous or exogenous stressors closely correlates to the levels of cellular senescence and redox imbalance markers, suggesting the usefulness of sCLU as a sensitive biomarker of senescence and cellular stress."
https://openalex.org/W1991064396,"Individuals with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) are at increased risk for schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Given the prevalence of visual processing deficits in these three disorders, a causal relationship between genes in the deleted region of chromosome 22 and visual processing is likely. Therefore, 22q11DS may represent a unique model to understand the neurobiology of visual processing deficits related with ASD and psychosis.We measured Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) during a texture segregation task in 58 children with 22q11DS and 100 age-matched controls. The C1 component was used to index afferent activity of visual cortex area V1; the texture negativity wave provided a measure for the integrity of recurrent connections in the visual cortical system. COMT genotype and plasma proline levels were assessed in 22q11DS individuals.Children with 22q11DS showed enhanced feedforward activity starting from 70 ms after visual presentation. ERP activity related to visual feedback activity was reduced in the 22q11DS group, which was seen as less texture negativity around 150 ms post presentation. Within the 22q11DS group we further demonstrated an association between high plasma proline levels and aberrant feedback/feedforward ratios, which was moderated by the COMT(158) genotype.These findings confirm the presence of early visual processing deficits in 22q11DS. We discuss these in terms of dysfunctional synaptic plasticity in early visual processing areas, possibly associated with deviant dopaminergic and glutamatergic transmission. As such, our findings may serve as a promising biomarker related to the development of schizophrenia among 22q11DS individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2001673581,"Steel factor, the protein product of the Steel locus in the mouse, is a multifunctional signal for the primordial germ cell population. We have shown previously that its expression accompanies the germ cells during migration to the gonads, forming a ""travelling niche"" that controls their survival, motility, and proliferation. Here we show that these functions are distributed between the alternatively spliced membrane-bound and soluble forms of Steel factor. The germ cells normally migrate as individuals from E7.5 to E11.5, when they aggregate together in the embryonic gonads. Movie analysis of Steel-dickie mutant embryos, which make only the soluble form, at E7.5, showed that the germ cells fail to migrate normally, and undergo ""premature aggregation"" in the base of the allantois. Survival and directionality of movement is not affected. Addition of excess soluble Steel factor to Steel-dickie embryos rescued germ cell motility, and addition of Steel factor to germ cells in vitro showed that a fourfold higher dose was required to increase motility, compared to survival. These data show that soluble Steel factor is sufficient for germ cell survival, and suggest that the membrane-bound form provides a higher local concentration of Steel factor that controls the balance between germ cell motility and aggregation. This hypothesis was tested by addition of excess soluble Steel factor to slice cultures of E11.5 embryos, when migration usually ceases, and the germ cells aggregate. This reversed the aggregation process, and caused increased motility of the germ cells. We conclude that the two forms of Steel factor control different aspects of germ cell behavior, and that membrane-bound Steel factor controls germ cell motility within a ""motility niche"" that moves through the embryo with the germ cells. Escape from this niche causes cessation of motility and death by apoptosis of the ectopic germ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2002702695,"β-lapachone (β-lap), has been known to cause NQO1-dependnet death in cancer cells and sensitize cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR). We investigated the mechanisms underlying the radiosensitization caused by β-lap.β-lap enhanced the effect of IR to cause clonogenic cells in NQO1(+)-MDA-MB-231 cells but not in NQO1(-)-MDA-MB-231 cells. β-lap caused apoptosis only in NQO1(+) cells and not in NQO1(-) cells and it markedly increased IR-induced apoptosis only in NQO1(+) cells. Combined treatment of NQO1(+) cells induced ROS generation, triggered ER stress and stimulated activation of ERK and JNK. Inhibition of ROS generation by NAC effectively attenuated the activation of ERK and JNK, induction of ER stress, and subsequent apoptosis. Importantly, inhibition of ERK abolished ROS generation and ER stress, whereas inhibition of JNK did not, indicating that positive feedback regulation between ERK activation and ROS generation triggers ER stress in response to combined treatment. Furthermore, prevention of ER stress completely blocked combination treatment-induced JNK activation and subsequent apoptotic cell death. In addition, combined treatment efficiently induced the mitochondrial translocation of cleaved Bax, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, and the nuclear translocation of AIF, all of which were efficiently blocked by a JNK inhibitor. Caspases 3, 8 and 9 were activated by combined treatment but inhibition of these caspases did not abolish apoptosis indicating caspase activation played a minor role in the induction of apoptosis.β-lap causes NQO1-dependent radiosensitization of cancer cells. When NQO1(+) cells are treated with combination of IR and β-lap, positive feedback regulation between ERK and ROS leads to ER stress causing JNK activation and mitochondrial translocation of cleaved Bax. The resultant decrease in mitochondrial membrane leads to translocation of AIF and apoptosis."

We show that this system can perform 96 synaptic vesicle cycling assays in parallel with high sensitivity, precision, uniformity, and reproducibility and can detect modulators of presynaptic function. By screening libraries of pharmacologically defined compounds on rat forebrain cultures, we have used this system to identify novel effects of compounds on specific aspects of presynaptic function. As a system for unbiased compound as well as genomic screening, this technology has significant applications for basic neuroscience research and for the discovery of novel, mechanism-based treatments for central nervous system disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1978638418,"Cellular homeostasis relies on a tight control of protein synthesis, folding and degradation, in which the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) have an instrumental function. ER stress and aberrant accumulation of misfolded proteins represent a pathological signature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal paralytic disorder caused by the selective degeneration of motoneurons in the brain and spinal cord. Mutations in the ER-resident protein VAPB have been associated with familial forms of the disease. ALS-linked mutations cause VAPB to form cytoplasmic aggregates. We previously demonstrated that viral-mediated expression of both wildtype and mutant human VAPB (hVAPB) leads to an ER stress response that contributes to the selective death of motoneurons. However, the mechanisms behind ER stress, defective UPS and hVAPB-associated motoneuron degeneration remain elusive. Here, we show that the overexpression of wildtype and mutated hVAPB, which is found to be less stable than the wildtype protein, leads to the abnormal accumulation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein conjugates in non-human primate cells. We observed that overexpression of both forms of hVAPB elicited an ER stress response. Treatment of wildtype and mutated hVAPB expressing cells with the ER stress inhibitor salubrinal diminished the burden of ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting that ER stress contributes to the impairment of proteasome function. We also found that both wildtype and mutated hVAPB can associate with the 20S proteasome, which was found to accumulate at the ER with wildtype hVAPB or in mutant hVAPB aggregates. Our results suggest that ER stress and corruption of the proteasome function might contribute to the aberrant protein homeostasis associated with hVAPB."
https://openalex.org/W2023231916,"Lymphocyte enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF-1) plays a crucial role in B lineage development and is only expressed in B cell precursors as B cell differentiation into mature B and plasma cells silences its expression. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells aberrantly express LEF-1 and its expression is required for cellular survival. We hypothesized that modification of the differentiation status of CLL cells would result in loss of LEF-1 expression and eliminate the survival advantage provided by its aberrant expression. In this study, we first established a methodology that induces CLL cells to differentiate into immunoglobulin (Ig) secreting cells (ISC) using the TLR9 agonist, CpG, together with cytokines (CpG/c). CpG/c stimulation resulted in dramatic CLL cell phenotypic and morphologic changes, expression of cytoplasmic Ig, and secretion of light chain restricted Ig. CpG/c stimulation also resulted in decreased CLL cell LEF-1 expression and increased Blimp-1 expression, which is crucial for plasma cell differentiation. Further, Wnt pathway activation and cellular survival were impaired in differentiated CLL cells compared to undifferentiated CLL cells. These data support the notion that CLL can differentiate into ISC and that this triggers decreased leukemic cell survival secondary to the down regulation of LEF-1 and decreased Wnt pathway activation."
https://openalex.org/W2037611013,"Craniosynostosis (CS), the premature ossification of cranial sutures, is attributed to increased osteogenic potential of resident osteoblasts, yet the contribution of the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) on osteogenic differentiation is unclear. The osteoblast-secreted ECM provides binding sites for cellular adhesion and regulates the transport and signaling of osteoinductive factors secreted by the underlying dura mater. The binding affinity of each osteoinductive factor for the ECM may amplify or mute its relative effect, thus contributing to the rate of suture fusion. The purpose of this paper was to examine the role of ECM composition derived from calvarial osteoblasts on protein binding and its resultant effect on cell phenotype. We hypothesized that potent osteoinductive proteins present during sutural fusion (e.g., bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1)) would exhibit distinct differences in binding when exposed to ECMs generated by human calvarial osteoblasts from unaffected control individuals (CI) or CS patients. Decellularized ECMs produced by osteoblasts from CI or CS patients were incubated in the presence of BMP-2 or TGF-β1, and the affinity of each protein was analyzed. The contribution of ECM composition to protein binding was interrogated by enzymatically modulating proteoglycan content within the ECM. BMP-2 had a similar binding affinity for each ECM, while TGF-β1 had a greater affinity for ECMs produced by osteoblasts from CI compared to CS patients. Enzymatic treatment of ECMs reduced protein binding. CS osteoblasts cultured on enzymatically-treated ECMs secreted by osteoblasts from CI patients in the presence of BMP-2 exhibited impaired osteogenic differentiation compared to cells on untreated ECMs. These data demonstrate the importance of protein binding to cell-secreted ECMs and confirm that protein-ECM interactions have an important role in directing osteoblastic differentiation of calvarial osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2009217790,"Network modularity is an important structural feature in metabolic networks. A previous study suggested that the variability in natural habitat promotes metabolic network modularity in bacteria. However, since many factors influence the structure of the metabolic network, this phenomenon might be limited and there may be other explanations for the change in metabolic network modularity. Therefore, we focus on archaea because they belong to another domain of prokaryotes and show variability in growth conditions (e.g., trophic requirement and optimal growth temperature), but not in habitats because of their specialized growth conditions (e.g., high growth temperature). The relationship between biological features and metabolic network modularity is examined in detail. We first show the absence of a relationship between network modularity and habitat variability in archaea, as archaeal habitats are more limited than bacterial habitats. Although this finding implies the need for further studies regarding the differences in network modularity, it does not contradict previous work. Further investigations reveal alternative explanations. Specifically, growth conditions, trophic requirement, and optimal growth temperature, in particular, affect metabolic network modularity. We have discussed the mechanisms for the growth condition-dependant changes in network modularity. Our findings suggest different explanations for the changes in network modularity and provide new insights into adaptation and evolution in metabolic networks, despite several limitations of data analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2008260375,"The present study addressed the question of whether count and mass nouns are differentially processed in the brain. In two different ERP (Event-Related Potentials) tasks we explored the semantic and syntactic levels of such distinction. Mass and count nouns typically differ in concreteness, hence the effect of this important variable was factorially examined in each task. Thus the stimuli presented were: count concrete, count abstract, mass concrete or mass abstract. The first experiment (concrete/abstract semantic judgment task) involved the interaction between the N400 concreteness effect and the Mass/Count condition, revealing a substantial effect between mass and count nouns at the semantic level. The second experiment (sentence syntactic violation task) showed a Mass/Count distinction on left anterior negativity (LAN) and on P600 components, confirming the difference at the syntactic level. This study suggests that the brain differentiates between count and mass nouns not only at the syntactic level but also at the semantic level. Implications for our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying the Mass/Count distinction are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2014988965,"The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored membrane protein, regulates urokinase (uPA) protease activity, chemotaxis, cell-cell interactions, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. uPAR expression is increased in cytokine or bacteria activated cell populations, including macrophages and monocytes. However, it is unclear if uPAR has direct involvement in the response of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, to Toll like receptor (TLR) stimulation. In this study, we found that uPAR is required for optimal neutrophil activation after TLR2, but not TLR4 stimulation. We found that the expression of TNF-α and IL-6 induced by TLR2 engagement in uPAR-/- neutrophils was less than that in uPAR+/+ (WT) neutrophils. Pretreatment of neutrophils with PI-PLC, which cleaves GPI moieties, significantly decreased TLR2 induced expression of TNF-α in WT neutrophils, but demonstrated only marginal effects on TNF-α expression in PAM treated uPAR-/- neutrophils. IκB-α degradation and NF-κB activation were not different in uPAR-/- or WT neutrophils after TLR2 stimulation. However, uPAR is required for optimal p38 MAPK activation after TLR2 engagement. Consistent with the in vitro findings that uPAR modulates TLR2 engagement induced neutrophil activation, we found that pulmonary and systemic inflammation induced by TLR2, but not TLR4 stimulation is reduced in uPAR-/- mice compared to WT counterparts. Therefore, our data suggest that neutrophil associated uPAR could be a potential target for treating acute inflammation, sepsis, and organ injury related to severe bacterial and other microbial infections in which TLR2 engagement plays a major role."
https://openalex.org/W2041423668,"Deception remains a hotly debated topic in evolutionary and behavioural research. Our understanding of what impedes or facilitates the use and detection of deceptive signals in humans is still largely limited to studies of verbal deception under laboratory conditions. Recent theoretical models of non-human behaviour have suggested that the potential outcome for deceivers and the ability of receivers to discriminate signals can effectively maintain their honesty. In this paper, we empirically test these predictions in a real-world case of human deception, simulation in soccer. In support of theoretical predictions in signalling theory, we show that cost-free deceit by soccer players decreases as the potential outcome for the signaller becomes more costly. We further show that the ability of receivers (referees) to detect deceptive signals may limit the prevalence of deception by soccer players. Our study provides empirical support to recent theoretical models in signalling theory, and identifies conditions that may facilitate human deception and hinder its detection."

Direct sequencing of human tumors has identified hundreds of mutations in tumors, but many of these are thought to be unnecessary and a result of, rather than a cause of, the tumor. The exact number of mutations to transform a normal human cell into a tumor cell is unknown. Here I show that male gonadal germ cell tumors, the most common form of testicular cancers, occur after four mutations. I infer this by constructing a mathematical model based upon the multi-hit hypothesis and comparing it to the age-specific incidence data. This result is consistent with the multi-hit hypothesis, and implies that these cancers are genetically or epigenetically predetermined at birth or an early age."

However, this directional mapping, from inputs to outputs, is part of a loop; sensory stimuli cause actions and vice versa. Here, we explore whether actions affect the understanding of the sensory input that they cause. Using a visuo-motor task in humans, we demonstrate two types of learning-related behavioral effects. Stimulus-dependent effects reflect stimulus-response learning, while action-dependent effects reflect a distinct learning component, allowing the brain to predict the forthcoming sensory outcome of actions. Together, the stimulus-dependent and the action-dependent learning components allow the brain to construct a complete internal representation of the sensory-motor loop."
https://openalex.org/W2076416191,"Dosage compensation is a specialized form of gene regulation that balances sex-chromosome linked gene expression between the sexes. In C. elegans, dosage compensation is achieved by the activity of the dosage compensation complex (DCC). The DCC binds along both X chromosomes in hermaphrodites to down-regulate gene expression by half, limiting X-linked gene products to levels produced in XO males. Sequence motifs enriched on the X chromosome play an important role in targeting the DCC to the X. However, these motifs are not strictly X-specific and therefore other factors, such as the chromatin environment of the X chromosome, are likely to aid in DCC targeting. Previously, we found that loss of HTZ-1 results in partial disruption of dosage compensation localization to the X chromosomes. We wanted to know whether other chromatin components coordinated with HTZ-1 to regulate DCC localization. One candidate is DPY-30, a protein known to play a role in DCC localization. DPY-30 homologs in yeast, flies, and mammals are highly conserved members of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase Set1/MLL complexes. Therefore, we investigated the hypothesis that the dosage compensation function of DPY-30 involves H3K4 methylation. We found that in dpy-30 animals the DCC fails to stably bind chromatin. Interestingly, of all the C. elegans homologs of Set1/MLL complex subunits, only DPY-30 is required for stable DCC binding to chromatin. Additionally, loss of H3K4 methylation does not enhance DCC mislocalization in htz-1 animals. We conclude that DPY-30 and HTZ-1 have unique functions in DCC localization, both of which are largely independent of H3K4 methylation."

https://openalex.org/W2006311610,"Spontaneous activity is an essential attribute of neuronal networks and plays a critical role in their development and maintenance. Upon blockade of activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX), neurons degenerate slowly and die in a manner resembling neurodegenerative diseases-induced neuronal cell death. The molecular cascade leading to this type of slow cell death is not entirely clear. Primary post-natal cortical neurons were exposed to TTX for up to two weeks, followed by molecular, biochemical and immunefluorescence analysis. The expression of the neuronal marker, neuron specific enolase (NSE), was down-regulated, as expected, but surprisingly, there was a concomitant and striking elevation in expression of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Immunofluorescence analysis indicated that tPA was highly elevated inside affected neurons. Transfection of an endogenous tPA inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), protected the TTX-exposed neurons from dying. These results indicate that tPA is a pivotal player in slowly progressing activity deprivation-induced neurodegeneration."

We demonstrate that Tim17b protein is required strictly for protein delivery to mitochondrial matrix. Knockdown of Tim17b completely disrupts functions of the mitochondrial translocase complex. Using fluorescent recovery after photobleaching assay, we show that Tim17b protein has a very stable localization in the membranes of the mitochondrial network and that its exchange rate is close to zero when compared with soluble proteins of mitochondrial matrix. These results confirm that we have developed comprehensive tools to study functions of heterochromatic Tim17b gene."
