https://openalex.org/W2132584224,"Embryological and genetic evidence indicates that the vertebrate head is induced by a different set of signals from those that organize trunk-tail development. The gene cerberus encodes a secreted protein that is expressed in anterior endoderm and has the unique property of inducing ectopic heads in the absence of trunk structures. Here we show that the cerberus protein functions as a multivalent growth-factor antagonist in the extracellular space: it binds to Nodal, BMP and Wnt proteins via independent sites. The expression of cerberus during gastrulation is activated by earlier nodal-related signals in endoderm and by Spemann-organizer factors that repress signalling by BMP and Wnt. In order for the head territory to form, we propose that signals involved in trunk development, such as those involving BMP, Wnt and Nodal proteins, must be inhibited in rostral regions."

The corresponding gene is located on human chromosome 8 in band 8q13. The open reading frame of the mRNA encodes a protein of 1119 amino acids forming two distinct domains. The N-terminal domain consists of 18 repeats that are related to the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin. The C-terminal domain contains six putative transmembrane segments that resemble many ion channels. This overall structure is reminiscent of TRP-like proteins that function as store-operated calcium channels. The novel protein with anMr of 130 kDa is expressed at a very low level in human fibroblasts and at a moderate level in liposarcoma cells. Overexpression in eukaryotic cells appears to interfere with normal growth, suggesting that it might play a direct or indirect role in signal transduction and growth control.

Overexpression in eukaryotic cells appears to interfere with normal growth, suggesting that it might play a direct or indirect role in signal transduction and growth control. Fibroblasts transformed by tumor viruses are often used in the laboratory as a model system to investigate transformation-associated changes in the phenotype and in the adhesive properties of the cells (1Pastan I. Willingham M. Nature. 1978; 274: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Dubbelman T.M.A.R. Yamada K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 693: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Usually these fibroblasts exhibit a roundish shape and show reduced adhesion to their substratum similar to authentic tumor cells. In contrast to spontaneous cancer cells, virally transformed fibroblasts have the advantage that the normal counterpart, the original cell, is available for comparative studies. A set of transformation-sensitive proteins that are expressed by normal fibroblasts but specifically repressed after oncogenic transformation has emerged from these studies. The best known example is fibronectin, an important adhesion protein of the extracellular matrix (3Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar). It is likely that the down-regulation of fibronectin and the other transformation-sensitive proteins contributes to the establishment of the transformed phenotype and to the unrestricted growth of tumor cells. We have recently used this model system in combination with a subtractive cDNA cloning approach to identify novel transformation-sensitive proteins (4Schenker T. Lach C. Kessler B. Calderara S. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25447-25453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schenker T. Trueb B. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 239: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our efforts led to the isolation of more than 40 cDNA clones that showed a dramatic reduction in their relative synthesis after oncogenic transformation. The proteins encoded by these clones could be grouped into four distinct classes (5Schenker T. Trueb B. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 239: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar): cytoskeletal proteins (e.g. vinculin, SM22), extracellular matrix proteins (e.g. fibronectin, collagen VI), proteolytic enzymes (e.g. collagenase, urokinase), and regulatory proteins (e.g. IGFBP-5, myosin kinase). Six novel gene products were discovered during our study, including a GTP-binding protein (4Schenker T. Lach C. Kessler B. Calderara S. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25447-25453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a zyxin-like protein (6Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and a novel serine protease (7Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Here we set out to characterize one of the new cDNA clones. This clone codes for an integral membrane protein with 18 ANK repeats. The polypeptide appears to combine the features of the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin with those of an ion channel. The function of the novel protein remains obscure, although there is circumstantial evidence that it might be involved in a growth regulatory pathway. A cDNA clone of 207 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); APH, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase; DAPI, 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TRP, transient receptor potential protein; TRPL, TRP-like protein; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid that originated from a subtracted cDNA library (4Schenker T.

Res. 1998; 239: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primed oligo-labeling method (8Feinberg A. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). This probe was used to screen approximately 0.5 × 106 recombinant phages of a commercial cDNA library, which had been prepared from human lung fibroblasts (HL1011,CLONTECH Laboratories) by the plaques hybridization technique (9Benton W.D. Davis R.W. Science. 1977; 196: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar). Positive colonies were picked, amplified, and subcloned into the plasmid pUC19 following standard procedures (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar). To obtain the 5′ end of the cDNA, the RACE technique was applied using methyl mercuric hydroxide-denatured mRNA from human fibroblasts (IMR90) and the AmpliFINDER RACE kit (CLONTECH). Two synthetic oligonucleotide primers were prepared for this purpose corresponding to the cDNA sequence (reverse primer nucleotides 523–547, nested primer nucleotides 439–466). The sequences of the isolated cDNA clones were determined on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination technique (11Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) using Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To resolve ambiguities observed in the 5′ region, suitable restriction fragments were subcloned into the sequencing vectors M13mp18 and M13mp19 and subsequently sequenced in the presence of dITP instead of dGTP. All sequences were analyzed with the software computer package of the Genetics Computer Group (University of Wisconsin, WI) using default settings unless otherwise stated. The sequences were compared with all entries of the EBI data bank (release 55.0) and the Swissprot data bank (release 36.0). Total RNA was extracted from confluent cell layers by the SDS/proteinase K method (12Rowe D.W. Moen R.C. Davidson J.M. Byers P.H. Bornstein P. Palmiter R.D. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For some experiments this RNA was further purified by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose utilizing an mRNA isolation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The RNA (15 μg total RNA or 2 μg of poly(A+) RNA/lane) was resolved on 1% agarose gels in the presence of 1 mformaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes by vacuum blotting (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes at 42 °C in a buffer containing 50% formamide. After being washed at regular stringency (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar), the membranes were exposed to BioMax MS film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) or analyzed with a phosphorimager (Storm 840, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The multiple tissue Northern blots used in this study contained poly(A+) RNA from 16 adult human tissues (MTN I, MTN II,CLONTECH) and total RNA from 4 fetal human tissues (Northern Territory Human Fetal Tissue, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). All these blots were processed as described above. Competitive PCR was performed essentially as described by Gilliland et al. (13Gilliland G. Perrin S. Blanchard K. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+RNA (0.25 μg) was transcribed into cDNA with 25 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase using a cDNA synthesis kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The reaction (total volume 20 μl) was primed with an oligonucleotide corresponding to positions 3115–3137 of the cDNA sequence. Aliquots of the single-stranded cDNA (0.5 μl) were amplified with AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin Elmer) in the presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2 through 35 cycles of 1′ at 94 °C, 1′ at 50 °C, and 45“ at 72 °C. The upper primer for this PCR corresponded to positions 2780–2802 of the cDNA, the lower primer was identical compared with the one used for first strand synthesis. For quantitative experiments, the PCR was competed with serial 3-fold dilutions of a competitor template. This competitor consisted of the SacI/PstI restriction fragment derived from the cDNA (positions 2662–3366) which contained, in its EcoRV site (position 2919), 52 unrelated nucleotides from pcDNA3.1 (positions 2003–2054). Amplification of this competitor template yields a 410-bp fragment, whereas amplification of the authentic cDNA gives a 358-bp fragment. The PCR products were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide. The initial amount of cDNA was estimated by the amount of competitor DNA that had to be added to the PCR in order to obtain equimolar levels of the 358- and 410-bp products. Normal human fibroblasts as well as various transformed cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA): WI38 (CCL75), IMR90 (CCL 186), WI38 VA13 (CCL 75.1), A204 (HTB 82), A673 (CRL 1598), Hs729T (HTB 153), RD (CCL-136), HT1080 (CCL 121), Hs913T (HTB 152), MG63 (CRL 1427), SW1353 (HTB 94), SW872 (HTB 92), SK-LMS-1 (HTB 88), SK-UT-1 (HTB 114), and COS-1 (CRL-1650). All cells were grown at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 9% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. For immunological analysis the cells were scraped with a rubber policeman into an isotonic buffer containing various protease inhibitors and lysed by freezing and thawing. Cellular proteins were further fractionated into water soluble cytoplasmatic proteins, detergent soluble membrane proteins, and nuclear proteins as described (14Baltensperger K. Porzig H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10151-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The localization of the p120 gene was determined by FISH as described (15Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 16Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. Genomics. 1997; 45: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Metaphase spreads of human chromosomes were prepared from synchronized lymphocytes and fixed on glass slides. One of the cDNA clones (3,863 bp) was labeled with biotinylated dATP and hybridized overnight at 37 °C to the denatured chromatin in a buffer containing 50% formamide. After being washed, the slides were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin and counterstained with DAPI. The FISH signal and the DAPI banding pattern were separately recorded (15Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 16Zumbrunn J. Trueb B. Genomics. 1997; 45: 461-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1105–1119 of p120 (Neosystem, Strasbourg, France). A tyrosine residue was introduced at the N terminus of the peptide to enable coupling to the carrier protein ovalbumin. The peptide-ovalbumin conjugate was injected into two rabbits at 14-day intervals (17Trueb B. Winterhalter K.H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). After the fourth injection, blood was collected and the antibodies were purified from the serum by affinity chromatography following standard procedures (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For this purpose an affinity column was prepared that carried the C terminus of p120 expressed as a bacterial fusion protein. ASacI/EcoRI restriction fragment (nucleotides 3361–3888 corresponding to amino acids 1063–1119) was ligated into the expression vector pGEX-5X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the correct reading frame. This construct was transfected into competent bacteria (Escherichia coli BL21) and expressed after induction with isopropyl thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration 0.1 mm). The bacteria were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonification in 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.5. After washing of the cell debris with the same buffer, the fusion protein was extracted with 2% SDS, 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.5. This extract was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) according to the instructions of the supplier. The purified antibodies were tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (17Trueb B. Winterhalter K.H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, cell culture proteins were separated on 3–10% gradient polyacrylamide gels (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose (17Trueb B. Winterhalter K.H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2815-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). After residual sites had been blocked with bovine serum albumin, the blot was incubated with antibodies at a dilution of 1:50 (relative to initial volume). Bound antibodies were detected with a phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma), followed by development with bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate. A full-length construct was created by ligation of selected restriction fragments derived from our cDNA clones into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). The final construct contained nucleotides 63–3888 inserted into the KpnI/XbaI site of the plasmid. Identity and reading frame were verified by DNA sequencing. The construct was transfected into monkey cells (COS-1) for transient expression or into human cells (A204 and HT1080) for stable expression. To this end, the cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with serum to about 50% confluency (approximately 105 cells/10 cm2dish), and the plasmid DNA (2 μg/10 cm2 dish) was added along with 8 μl of Lipofectin in a total volume of 2 ml of Opti-MEM (both from Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). After an incubation period of 12 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with serum, and the cells were allowed to recover for 48 h. Resistant colonies were selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml Geneticin G418 sulfate (Life Technologies) over a period of 4–8 weeks (10Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from resistant colonies with the RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Expression of the p120 gene was analyzed by Northern blotting using the full-length cDNA for p120 as a probe. Expression of the G418 resistance gene APH was detected with a radiolabeled PstI/NcoI restriction fragment derived from pcDNA3.1 (nucleotides 2314–2702). We have previously reported on the preparation of a subtracted cDNA library enriched for clones that are expressed by normal but not by SV40 transformed human fibroblasts (4Schenker T. Lach C. Kessler B. Calderara S. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25447-25453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schenker T. Trueb B. Exp. Cell. Res. 1998; 239: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One of the clones derived from this library attracted our attention because its expression was completely down-regulated upon oncogenic transformation. This clone was 207-bp long and appeared to code for a novel ankyrin-like protein. The clone was now used as a probe to screen a commercial cDNA library prepared from human fibroblasts with the intention to isolate the full coding region for the novel ankyrin-like protein. After four rounds of screening we obtained 21 independent λ clones, but none of them reached all the way to the 5′ end of the corresponding mRNA. The RACE technique was therefore utilized to amplify the 5′ end, which resulted in the isolation of 11 additional clones. Altogether, the 32 cDNA clones covered a contiguous sequence of 4230 bp (Fig. 1). This sequence started with a 5′ untranslated region of 174 bp that was particularly rich in the nucleotides G and C. The first ATG codon at position 175–177 was preceded by two in frame stop codons. This putative translation start site was followed by an open reading frame of 3357 nucleotides that terminated in the stop codon TAG (position 3532–3534). After the stop codon, there was a 3′ untranslated sequence of 708 nucleotides which harbored two consensus polyadenylation signals AATAAA at position 3842–3847 and 4218–4223. The sequence of the probe used for screening was found at position 1607–1813. The open reading frame predicts a protein of 1119 amino acids with a molecular mass of 127.4 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.0 (Fig. 1). In the following, this polypeptide will be termed p120. It contains five potential glycosylation sites of the form NXT/S, but only two sites are likely to be used for modification (positions 747 and 753) because only these sites are situated in the extra-cytoplasmic portion of the novel protein (see below). Detailed computer analyses revealed that the novel polypeptide can be divided into two parts, an N-terminal part that is related to the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin and a C-terminal part that is related to transmembrane proteins. The N-terminal part encompasses 18 repeats of 33 amino acids each (Fig. 2A). Fifteen of these repeats share 21–52% identity (or 27–55% similarity if conserved amino acid substitutions are included) with the consensus motifXGXTPLHLAARXGHVEVVKLLLDXGADVNAXTK derived from ankyrin-like proteins (21Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8703-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Michaely P. Bennett V. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 127-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Peters L.L. Lux S.E. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 85-118PubMed Google Scholar). Three repeats contain only part of the ANK motif (in particular, the Leu-His sequence) but are otherwise barely related to the ANK consensus sequence. Given this repetitive structure, it seems likely that the N-terminal portion of the novel protein evolved from an ancestral ANK motif that was duplicated 15–18 times during evolution. ANK motifs occur in a large variety of proteins with vastly different functions (21Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8703-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Michaely P. Bennett V. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 127-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 23Peters L.L. Lux S.E. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 85-118PubMed Google Scholar), including cytoskeletal proteins (ankyrin), transcriptional regulators (NFκB, IκB, bcl-3), and membrane-bound receptors (Notch). The C-terminal part of the novel polypeptide encompasses seven hydrophobic segments of about 20 amino acids each, which may act as transmembrane domains. A hydrophobicity plot according to Kyte and Doolittle (24Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar) locates these segments at positions 722–742, 767–787, 806–824, 850–870, 873–893, 941–961, and 1010–1030 (Fig. 2B). Another program based on the algorithm of Engelmanet al. (25Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) also predicts seven hydrophobic segments, but this program places one of them at position 897–917 instead of position 850–870. It is therefore possible that only six of the hydrophobic segments function as transmembrane domains, while one of them (probably the segment at position 850–870 which contains several charged residues) does not span across the entire membrane but enters the lipid bilayer partially. This structure is reminiscent of some ion channels, which possess six transmembrane domains and a pore loop gating the channel (26MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 889-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 27Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 715-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Since the polypeptide does not contain a typical signal peptide at its N terminus, an internal segment must serve as signal peptide as found for example with the anion exchanger of the red blood cell membrane (28Tanner M.J.A. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 34-57PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tam L.Y. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32542-32550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The topological orientation of membrane proteins can be predicted by analysis of positive charges adjacent to the first transmembrane domain (30Sipos L. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These predictions suggest that the novel protein will assume a type II orientation, in which the N-terminal domain with all the ANK repeats lies at the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane as proposed in Fig. 2C. In this model, the two glycosylation signals found at positions 747 and 753 occur in the first extracellular loop and should therefore be accessible for modification by N-linked carbohydrates. It is obvious that this proposed structure awaits verification by experiments. In addition to the ANK repeats and to the transmembrane domains, the predicted protein contains an N-terminal segment of 60 residues and a C-terminal segment of 90 residues. Both of these segments do not reveal substantial similarity to any known protein motif. The amino acid sequence of the novel protein was compared with all entries of the Swissprot data bank. Numerous hits were found that corresponded to the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin and to other proteins containing ANK repeats. In addition to these hits, we found one protein that had emerged from the genome project of the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans (C29E6.2, accession number Z72504). Using a GAP creation weight of 9 and an extension weight of 3, an alignment with 28% identity or 37% similarity resulted and extended over the entire length of the two proteins, including the ANK repeats and the transmembrane domains (not shown). Nothing is known about the function of the C. elegans protein as it was simply predicted by computer analysis of the genomic sequence. Nevertheless, the striking conservation of the primary structure between two such distantly related species may indicate a fundamental function of the new protein. The cDNA sequence of p120 was also compared with all expressed sequence tags stored in the EST data bank. Three partial cDNA clones were found that matched our cDNA sequence (not shown), namely AA502409 (441 bp), AA972567 (284 bp), and AA873172 (580 bp). Interestingly, all these clones were derived from human tumor samples (colon, lung, and kidney), which were analyzed in the course of the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP). The significance of this finding is not yet clear. The expression of the novel gene was analyzed by Northern blotting experiments. On a blot containing RNA from different batches of human fibroblasts (WI38, IMR90), our cDNA clones hybridized to a single band of 4.6 kilobases (Fig. 3). This size is in agreement with the length of our cDNA sequence (4230 bp) assuming a poly(A) tail of about 300 nucleotides. With RNA from SV40 transformed fibroblasts (VA13) no signal was obtained, indicating that transcription of the corresponding gene was completely turned off after oncogenic transformation. To determine whether expression of the p120 gene was repressed exclusively in virally transformed fibroblasts or whether this down-regulation was a common feature of transformed cells, we analyzed 11 different cell lines derived from spontaneous mesenchymal tumors (Fig. 3). Cells from four rhabdomyosarcomas, two fibrosarcomas, an osteosarcoma, and a chondrosarcoma did not possess any traces of the mRNA. When two different leiomyosarcoma cell lines were examined, the p120 mRNA was detected at a low level in one, but not in the other. Only cells from a liposarcoma contained large amounts of the p120 mRNA. Rehybridization of the same Northern blot with a probe for GAPDH demonstrated that all lanes contained similar amounts of intact RNA. Thus, the repression of the p120 mRNA is a common feature of most, but not all, mesenchymal tumor cells. We now asked the question what tissues might express the novel mRNA. To this end our probes were hybridized to commercial Northern blots containing mRNA from various adult human tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, lung, placenta, kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, thymus, brain, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, colon, and cultivated leukocytes. To our surprise, we were not able to detect any signal that was stronger than background (not shown). Likewise, a Northern blot containing RNA from four fetal human tissues (brain, liver, lung, and skeletal muscle) did not yield any distinct signal. Rehybridization of the same blots with probes for β-actin or GAPDH produced strong signals, indicating that all the blots contained normal amounts of undegraded mRNA. It therefore appears that all the human tissues investigated above produce extremely low amounts of the p120 mRNA, which cannot be traced by Northern blotting. We therefore used a very sensitive PCR approach to detect expression of the p120 gene in normal human tissues (Fig. 4). The mRNA was transcribed into cDNA and used as template for competitive PCR. A pair of strand-specific primers was selected, which allowed amplification of a 358-bp fragment corresponding to the fourth and fifth putative transmembrane domain. These domains were chosen because we have evidence that they are encoded by two separate exons. 2T. Schenker and B. Trueb, unpublished observation. For quantitation, a competitor template was used as an internal standard. This template consisted of the same 358-bp sequence but harbored additionally an unrelated sequence of 52 bp (total length 410 bp) in its center to permit distinction between competitor DNA and the 358-bp cDNA on a polyacrylamide gel. The competitor template was added to the reactions at serial 3-fold dilutions. At a high cDNA to competitor ratio, amplification of the 358-bp fragment was observed, whereas at a low ratio, amplification of the 410-bp competitor occurred. The absolute amount of cDNA in the reaction mixture could thus be estimated from the transition point where competitor DNA and cDNA fragment were obtained in equimolar amounts. Applying this technique to mRNA from cultivated fibroblasts, the expected band of 358 bp was obtained (Fig. 4). Equimolar amounts of the 358-bp fragment and the 410-bp competitor were reached when 3.3 × 106 copies of the competitor template were added to the reaction mixture. This number would correspond to approximately 500 copies of p120 mRNA per fibroblast. When RNA from a 12-week old human embryo was analyzed in a similar way, the diagnostic band of 358 bp was also obtained, indicating that the p120 gene was in fact expressed in human tissues. Competition experiments suggested that these tissues contained at least a 1000-fold lower level of p120 mRNA than cultivated fibroblasts. RNA from embryonic muscle possessed an even lower level, which was barely detectable by this sensitive method (not shown). The same results were obtained when another set of PCR primers was used. Thus, the p120 gene is faithfully transcribed in human tissues"

The key to the identification of this complex was the cloning and sequencing of two widely expressed, mammalian cDNAs encoding new homologs of the adaptor β and ς subunits named β4 and ς4, respectively. An antibody to β4 recognized in human cells an ∼83-kDa polypeptide that exists in both soluble and membrane-associated forms. Gel filtration, sedimentation velocity, and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that β4 is a component of a multisubunit complex (AP-4) that also contains the ς4 polypeptide and two additional adaptor subunit homologs named μ4 (μ-ARP2) and ε. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that AP-4 is associated with the trans-Golgi network or an adjacent structure and that this association is sensitive to the drug brefeldin A. We propose that, like the related AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 complexes, AP-4 plays a role in signal-mediated trafficking of integral membrane proteins in mammalian cells.

We propose that, like the related AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 complexes, AP-4 plays a role in signal-mediated trafficking of integral membrane proteins in mammalian cells. Sorting of integral membrane proteins at various stages of the endocytic and secretory pathways is mediated by interactions of signals contained within the cytosolic domains of these proteins with organellar coats associated with the cytosolic face of membranes (reviewed in Refs. 1Marks M.S.

Two types of signals referred to as “tyrosine-based” and “dileucine-based” have been implicated in various sorting processes in mammalian cells, including internalization from the plasma membrane, lysosomal targeting, delivery to the basolateral plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells, transport from early to late endosomes, and localization to specialized organelles such as melanosomes and antigen-processing compartments. Both tyrosine- and dileucine-based signals have been shown to interact with heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, adaptor protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EST, expressed sequence tag; GST, glutathione S-transferase; kb, kilobase pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TGN, trans-Golgi network complexes, which associate with the protein clathrin and accessory molecules to generate coated transport vesicles (1Marks M.S.

To date, three adaptor complexes, known as AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3, have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 4Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These complexes consist of two large chains (γ/α/δ and β1/β2/β3, ∼90–130 kDa), one medium chain (μ1/μ2/μ3, ∼50 kDa), and one small chain (ς1/ς2/ς3, ∼20 kDa) (Fig. 1A). The analogous subunits of the complexes are all structurally related and probably fulfill similar functions. For instance, the μ chains of the three complexes are involved in the recognition of tyrosine-based signals (5Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A.

The functions of the γ/α/δ and the ς subunits are less clear, although AP-2 α has been shown to interact with other components of the protein sorting machinery such as amphiphysin, dynamin, Eps15, and epsin (12Schmid S.L.

AP-1 plays a role in protein sorting from the TGN and endosomes to compartments of the endosomal/lysosomal system, while AP-2 is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (1Marks M.S. Ohno H.

The existence of more sorting events mediated by tyrosine- and dileucine-based signals than known AP complexes, however, suggests the existence of additional adaptors remaining to be identified (3Lewin D.A. Mellman I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 129-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this study, we have found through searches in EST data bases several cDNAs that encode new mammalian homologs of AP subunits. Antibodies raised to these homologs and to the recently described AP μ-related protein, μ-ARP2 (18Wang X. Kiliman M.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), allowed us to identify a novel heterotetrameric adaptor-like complex, which we named AP-4. Like other AP complexes, AP-4 is composed of two large chains (ε and β4), a medium chain (μ-ARP2, herein referred to as μ4), and a small chain (ς4) (Fig. 1B). AP-4 is widely expressed in mammalian tissues and associates with membranes as a peripheral membrane protein. By immunofluorescence microscopy, AP-4 was found to localize to the TGN or a neighboring compartment and to be sensitive to brefeldin A, a drug that also affects the distribution of AP-1 and AP-3 (7Dell'Angelica E.C.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These properties of AP-4 are similar to those of other AP complexes, suggesting that AP-4 may be a novel component of the cellular machinery that sorts integral membrane proteins in mammalian cells. All EST clones used in this study were from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA) and were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). DNA sequencing was performed on both strands using the dideoxy method. The mouse EST clone 619775 consisted of a portion of the ς4 cDNA spanning nucleotide 656 to the start of the poly(A) tail, while the mouse EST clones 442436 and 572356 comprised the complete coding region of ς4 together with both the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. Human EST clones 51094 and 206232 consisted of 3′ fragments of the β4 cDNA starting at nucleotides 1414 and 1724, respectively. The missing 5′ portion of the β4 cDNA was obtained from a human skeletal muscle Marathon Ready™ cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by sequential 5′-RACE PCR using primers complementary to nucleotides 1657–1683 and 1626–1651 for the first and second (nested) PCR steps, respectively. The final PCR product was cloned into the pNoTA/T7 vector (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Boulder, CO), and several independent clones were isolated and sequenced. Northern blot analysis was performed on multiple tissue blots (CLONTECH) as described previously (7Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Both the β4 and ς4 probes were obtained by PCR. The β4 probe comprised nucleotides 1776–2226 of the full-length β4 cDNA, while the probe for ς4 consisted of its complete coding sequence. A GST-β4C fusion construct was generated by PCR amplification of a cDNA segment encoding residues 601–739 of human β4, followed by cloning in frame into the BamHI–NotI sites of the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The GST-ς4-(18–54) and GST-μ4-(122–326) constructs, bearing residues 18–54 of mouse ς4 and residues 122–326 of human μ4/μ-ARP2 (EMBL data bank accession no. Y08387), respectively, were prepared by PCR and subsequent cloning into the EcoRI–NotI sites of the pGEX-5X-1 vector. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Overexpression of GST-β4C and GST-ς4-(18–54) in Escherichia coli yielded soluble proteins that were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GST-μ4-(122–326) fusion protein was insoluble and was purified from inclusion bodies by preparative SDS-PAGE. Polyclonal antibodies to β4 and ς4 were raised in rabbits by immunization with purified GST-β4Cand GST-ς4-(18–54) fusion proteins, respectively. The antibodies were affinity-purified (7Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and subsequently absorbed with immobilized GST (Pierce). An antiserum to μ4 was generated by immunizing rabbits with the GST-μ4-(122–326) fusion protein that had been purified on polyacrylamide gels. The anti-ε antiserum was raised in rabbits using as the immunogen the peptide TALTSKHEEEKLIQQELSSL (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The anti-AP-3 mouse antiserum was generated by immunization with a mixture of GST fusion proteins bearing portions of all of the AP-3 subunits; preparation of these GST-fusion proteins is described elsewhere (7Dell'Angelica E.C.

The sources of the remaining antibodies used in this study are indicated elsewhere (7Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S.

Cell. 1999; 3: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). All of the biochemical procedures used in this study have been described in a previous report (7Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Further details on the immunoprecipitation-recapture method are given elsewhere (23Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficient of AP-4 was estimated from sedimentation velocity experiments using the following protein markers (s20,w values given in parentheses): horse spleen ferritin (16.5 S), bovine catalase (11.3 S), BSA (4.6 S), and chicken ovalbumin (3.6 S) (24Marks M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). The gel filtration markers used to determine Stokes radii were those described previously (7Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the AP-4 complex was calculated on the basis of its Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient, assuming a partial specific volume of 0.72–0.75 cm3/g (24Marks M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). HeLa cell monolayers were grown on glass coverslips and in some cases treated with brefeldin A or transiently transfected with HA epitope-tagged constructs of TGN38 or furin (7Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 25Bosshart H. Humphrey J. Deignan E. Davidson J. Drazba J. Yuan L. Oorschot V. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1157-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1, v/v) for 10 min at −20 °C and subsequently air-dried. Incubation with the primary antibody diluted in PBS, 0.1% (w/v) saponin, 1 g/liter BSA, 50 mg/liter GST was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound antibodies were removed by rinsing with PBS for 5 min, and cells were subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig or Alexa 448-conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ig) diluted in PBS, 0.1% (w/v) saponin, 1 g/liter BSA, for 30–60 min at room temperature. After a final rinse with PBS, coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Fluorescence images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY). Complementary DNAs encoding two novel mammalian proteins related to subunits of the AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 complexes were identified through BLAST searches of EST data bases. One of the proteins was named β4 on the basis of its homology to the AP β subunits. Human β4 was predicted to be a protein of 739 amino acids and a molecular mass of 83,262 Da. Homology of β4 to the other AP β subunits was restricted to the so-called “trunk” amino-terminal domain, with the first ∼580 residues of β4 sharing 28% identical amino acids with the trunk domain of mammalian β1 and β2, and 21% identical amino acids with the corresponding segment in human β3A and β3B (Fig. 2A and data not shown). In these molecules, the trunk domain is linked to a carboxyl-terminal “ear” domain by a flexible, solvent-accessible “hinge” region (26Kirchhausen T. Nathanson K.L. Matsui W. Vaisberg A. Chow E.P. Burne C. Keen J.H. Davis A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2612-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, secondary structure and accessibility predictions (27Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar,28Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 20: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) revealed that residues ∼580–600 of β4 would correspond to a solvent-accessible, random coil structure preceding a carboxyl-terminal region with a high α-helix content (not shown). It is therefore plausible that the β4 molecule has a domain organization similar to that of the other AP β subunits, albeit with smaller hinge and ear domains (Fig. 1B). The other novel protein was named ς4 based on its homology to previously known AP ς subunits (Fig. 2B). The mouse ς4 cDNA encodes a 144-residue protein with a calculated molecular mass of 16,818 Da. Homology of ς4 to the other AP ς polypeptides was significant throughout its entire amino acid sequence (37–43% identity; Fig. 2B and data not shown). Northern analyses revealed expression of human β4 and mouse ς4 mRNA species in all tissues examined, although some differences in the expression patterns were observed (Fig. 3). The sizes of the major ∼2.5-kb and ∼1.2–1.4-kb species detected with the β4 and ς4 probes were consistent with those of the isolated β4 and ς4 cDNAs, respectively. A minor ∼6-kb species was also detected in some human tissues with the β4 probe; the nature of this species is unknown, although it could correspond to an unprocessed or alternatively spliced form of the β4 mRNA. To characterize the β4 protein, we raised a polyclonal antibody to its carboxyl-terminal region (anti-β4C). This antibody immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions several proteins from detergent lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled cells (Fig. 4A). In order to identify unambiguously the endogenous β4 protein, the immunoprecipitate was denatured with SDS and then subjected to a second immunoprecipitation step using the same antibody. This immunoprecipitation-recapture procedure (7Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 23Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar) resulted in the isolation of a single35S-labeled polypeptide that migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of ∼83-kDa (Fig. 4B,lane 1), a value that was in close agreement with the calculated molecular mass of β4. The specificity of the immunoprecipitation was corroborated by competition with excess GST-β4C (Fig. 4B, lane 2) and by using an irrelevant antibody (to BSA) in the recapture step (Fig. 4B, lane 3). The same immunoprecipitation-recapture procedure was used to establish that β4 was present in both cytosolic (C) and postnuclear membrane (M) fractions (Fig. 4C). The relative yields of soluble and membrane-associated forms of β4 were influenced by the composition of the homogenization buffer (Fig. 4C), as previously observed for the ς3 subunit of AP-3 (7Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In addition, the membrane-associated form could be partially extracted with either 0.5m Tris-HCl (Fig. 4D) or 1 m NaCl (data not shown), thus suggesting that β4 associated with membranes as a peripheral membrane protein. Upon fractionation of human fibroblast cytosol by gel filtration under nondenaturing conditions, β4 could be detected by immunoblotting in fractions corresponding to a Stokes radius of ∼65 Å (Fig. 5A). This size was significantly larger than that predicted for monomeric β4 and only slightly smaller than those of the AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 complexes (Fig. 5A), thus suggesting that endogenous β4 was part of a complex. To gain further insight into the physical properties and composition of the β4-containing complex, we performed sedimentation analyses on a sucrose gradient of a cytosolic extract from [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells. Gradient fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-β4 and irrelevant antibodies. Using this approach, we observed co-immunoprecipitation of the ∼83-kDa protein (corresponding to endogenous β4) with three other polypeptides of apparent molecular masses ∼140, ∼50, and ∼17 kDa (Fig. 5B). These polypeptides were not detected in the control immunoprecipitation with the irrelevant antibody (to GST) and were found to co-sediment with β4 on the sucrose gradient (Fig. 5B, fractions 7 and 8). The position of β4 and its associated polypeptides on the gradient corresponded to a species with a sedimentation coefficient of ∼10 S. Using this value and the estimated Stokes radius (see above), we calculated a molecular mass for the β4-containing complex of 280 ± 15 kDa. This value fits within the experimental error the predicted molecular mass of a complex containing one molecule each of β4 and the three associated polypeptides (i.e. ∼290 kDa). Taken together, these results indicated that β4 is a component of a multisubunit protein complex, which we named AP-4 based on its structural similarity to the previously characterized AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 adaptors. We hypothesized that the polypeptides associated with β4 could correspond to other homologs of known AP subunits. Likely candidates for the ∼17- and ∼50-kDa polypeptides were the ς4 protein identified in this study and the previously described AP μ subunit homolog μ4/μ-ARP2 (18Wang X. Kiliman M.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, a search of EST data bases resulted in the identification of a human cDNA clone (I.M.A.G.E. clone ID 1031294) containing a ∼0.4-kb insert that encodes a novel protein sequence with significant homology to the trunk region of the AP subunits α, γ, and δ (25–30% identical amino acids over a 132-residue overlap; data not shown). Northern blot analysis indicated that this cDNA fragment corresponded to a ubiquitously expressed mRNA species of about 7 kb (data not shown). Based on this information, we hypothesized that this as yet uncharacterized protein, herein referred to as ε, could correspond to the ∼140-kDa subunit of the AP-4 complex. To test these predictions, we raised antibodies to these putative AP-4 subunits and used these antibodies in immunoprecipitation-recapture experiments. AP-4 was first isolated from [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cells by immunoprecipitation with the anti-β4C antibody, and the immunoprecipitate was then denatured and subjected to reprecipitation with the same antibody or with antibodies to the other putative subunits (Fig. 6). As mentioned above, reprecipitation with the anti-β4C antibody yielded the ∼83-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 6, lane 8). In addition, reprecipitation with antibodies to ς4, μ4, and ε resulted in the isolation of the ∼17-, ∼50-, and ∼140-kDa subunits of the complex, respectively (Fig. 6). Specificity was verified by control reprecipitations using irrelevant rabbit immunoglobulins or preimmune sera (Fig. 6) or by competition experiments using purified antigens (data not shown). Furthermore, none of our antibodies to AP-4 subunits recognized components of AP-1, AP-2, or AP-3 on similar immunoprecipitation-recapture experiments (data not shown). The distribution of the endogenous AP-4 complex within HeLa cells was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using the anti-β4C antibody. AP-4 was localized to a punctate juxtanuclear structure reminiscent of the Golgi complex (Fig. 7, B, D,G, and J). Staining was specific as judged by its competition with an excess of the GST-β4C fusion protein (Fig. 7A) but not GST (Fig. 7B). In addition, treatment of the cells with brefeldin A, a drug that inactivates the small GTP-binding protein ARF1 (29Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), caused a rapid dispersal of AP-4 into the cytoplasm (Fig. 7C). The distribution of AP-4 was next compared with those of the previously described AP complexes by double immunofluorescence staining. AP-1 is mainly associated with the TGN (4Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), although it has also been detected on peripheral cytoplasmic foci corresponding to endosomes (30Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31Futter C.E. Gibson A. Allchin E.H. Maxwell S. Ruddock L.J. Odorizzi G. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7E). AP-2 is normally associated with coated pits at the plasma membrane (4Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7H). The localization of AP-3 has not yet been established with certainty, although recent evidence suggests that it is associated with a peripheral sorting compartment related to endosomes (7Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 11Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7K). The distribution of AP-4 most closely matched that of AP-1 in the juxtanuclear area (Fig. 7, D–F). A detailed inspection, however, revealed that the staining patterns for AP-4 and AP-1 were not completely overlapping (Fig. 7, D–F, insets), suggesting that the two complexes may be associated with different regions of the juxtanuclear structure. AP-4 exhibited little or no colocalization with AP-2 (Fig. 7, G–I) and AP-3 (Fig. 7, J–L). The distribution of AP-4 was also compared with those of several markers of compartments of the secretory and endocytic pathways. The highest degree of colocalization was observed with the TGN markers furin (Fig. 8, A–C) and TGN38 (Fig. 8, D–F). The AP-4 staining pattern also resembled to some extent that of a 58-kDa cis-medial Golgi protein (Fig. 8, G and H). However, merging of the two images (Fig. 8I) yielded much less overlap than that observed with markers of the TGN. The distribution of AP-4 showed little colocalization with that of Lamp-1, the transferrin receptor, or the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, all of which are considered markers for distinct compartments of the endosomal-lysosomal system (data not shown). Taken together, the immunofluorescence microscopy analyses suggested that AP-4 is associated with the TGN or with a compartment that is immediately adjacent to it. In recent years, there have been major advances in our understanding of the molecular machinery that mediates sorting of integral membrane proteins in the secretory and endocytic pathways. Our laboratory has been particularly interested in a subset of protein coats that contain heterotetrameric adaptor complexes among their major constituents. Three AP complexes have been described to date: AP-1, AP-2, and AP-3 (Fig. 1A). In this study, we describe a novel, widely expressed adaptor-like complex that we have named AP-4. In keeping with the nomenclature of heterotetrameric adaptors, the four subunits of AP-4 were named ε, β4, μ4, and ς4 (Fig. 1B). All of the AP-4 subunits are structurally related to their counterparts in other AP complexes, suggesting that AP-4 may resemble the other complexes with regard to overall conformation and role in protein sorting. The complete primary structures of the β4 and ς4 subunits of AP-4 are reported in this study (Fig. 2). Unlike ς4, which displays a significant degree of sequence similarity to other AP ς chains throughout the entire molecule, β4 homology to other AP β subunits is restricted to the amino-terminal trunk domain. This domain is thought to mediate association with the other subunits of the AP complexes (32Matsui W. Kirchhausen T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10791-10798Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Schröder S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7910-7918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the hinge-ear regions of β1, β2, and β3 (A or B) have been shown to interact with clathrin (10Shih W. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31083-31090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar,11Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 34Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4933-4942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A potential clathrin-binding motif, consisting of bulky hydrophobic and acidic residues, has recently been identified in the hinge-ear regions of β1, β2, and β3 (11Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J. Stoorvogel W. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1998; 280: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although β4 seems to bear hinge- and ear-like domains, these regions are devoid of such a motif. This is consistent with the observations that AP-4 was not enriched in a preparation of clathrin-coated vesicles from bovine brain and that a GST-β4C fusion protein failed to bind clathrin under conditions in which similar GST-β2 or -β3A fusion proteins displayed significant clathrin binding activity. 2E. C. Dell'Angelica, and J. S. Bonifacino, unpublished results. Since these results are negative, however, further work will be required to establish whether in vivo AP-4 interacts with clathrin or is a component of a non-clathrin coat. The ε subunit of AP-4 was identified by immunoprecipitation-recapture as the product of a novel cDNA for which we have obtained only a partial sequence. Similar experiments also allowed us to identify the μ4 subunit of AP-4 as a protein previously named μ-ARP2 (18Wang X. Kiliman M.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This protein belongs to the family of related AP μ subunits that have been shown to interact with tyrosine-based sorting signals (5Ohno H. Stewart J. Fournier M.C. Bosshart H. Rhee I. Miyatake S. Saito T. Gallusser A. Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1995; 269: 1872-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 6Ohno H. Fournier M.C. Poy G. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29009-29015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 7Dell'Angelica E.C. Ohno H. Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Roche K.W. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 917-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It is therefore tempting to speculate that μ4, and by extension the whole AP-4 complex, could play a role in sorting events mediated by tyrosine-based signals. Messenger RNAs encoding the subunits of AP-4 were detected in all tissues examined (this study and Ref. 18Wang X. Kiliman M.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). While the expression patterns of the human μ4, β4, and ε are similar to each other, they differ somewhat from that of mouse ς4 (Fig. 3, data not shown, and Ref. 18Wang X. Kiliman M.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The significance of these differences is at present unclear, since mRNA levels do not necessarily correlate with protein levels, especially in the case of multisubunit complexes. The existence of both cytosolic and membrane-bound pools of AP-4 supports the notion that this complex is a component of a protein coat that cycles between the cytosol and membranes, as is the case for other coats. Cycling of AP-1, AP-3, and the non-clathrin COPI coat is regulated by the small GTP-binding protein, ARF1, with the active (GTP-bound) form of this protein promoting coat association to membranes (19Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 129-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 22Ooi C.E. Dell'Angelica E.C. Bonifacino J.S. J.

A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The drug brefeldin A inhibits exchange of GDP for GTP on ARF1 (29Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and therefore causes redistribution of the coats to the cytosol due to a blockage in membrane association. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed a dramatic effect of the drug on the subcellular localization of AP-4. Dispersal of AP-4 from a juxtanuclear structure to the cytoplasm occurred within 30–60 s of incubation of HeLa cells with the drug at 37 °C (Fig. 7Cand data not shown). At these short incubation times, the drug also elicited complete redistribution of the Golgi-associated AP-1 and COPI coats but did not affect the distribution of Golgi-associated integral membrane proteins such as galactosyl transferase or TGN46.2Although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the observed effect of the drug on AP-4 distribution is due to the formation of small vesicles containing the complex, our results are consistent with the idea that membrane association of AP-4 may be regulated by ARF1 or a related protein. Our immunofluorescence microscopy analyses suggest that AP-4 is associated with the TGN or a compartment in the vicinity of the TGN. AP-4 could thus be involved in one of a number of vesicle-budding/sorting events that are thought to take place in post-Golgi compartments. For example, the lysosomal membrane protein Lamp-1, the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, and invariant chain-containing class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex are all sorted to endosomal or lysosomal compartments from the TGN (36Höning S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S.

Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Some endocytic receptors, such as the transferrin receptor and the asialoglycoprotein receptors, have been shown to transit from the TGN to early endosomes prior to their delivery to the cell surface (39Futter C.E. Connolly C.N. Cutler D.F. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10999-11003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 40Leitinger B. Hille-Rehfeld A. Spiess M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The TGN is also thought to be the site of formation of vesicles carrying cargo to the apical and basolateral plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells (41Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, other sorting events could take place within structures located in the proximity of the TGN, such as some endosomal compartments. AP-4 could be solely responsible for one of these sorting processes or could function as an alternative adaptor for processes that are also mediated by AP-1 or AP-3. The availability of reagents for AP-4 should now allow experiments aimed at elucidating these issues. We thank Marie-Christine Fournier for excellent technical assistance and Chean Eng Ooi for critical reading of the manuscript."

To elucidate the mechanism of action, the effect of histatin 5 on the viability ofCandida albicans cells was studied in relation to its membrane perturbing properties. It was found that both the killing activity and the membrane perturbing activity, studied by the influx of a DNA-specific marker propidium iodide, were inhibited by high salt conditions and by metabolic inhibitors, like sodium azide. In addition, exposure to histatin 5 resulted in a loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in situ, measured by the release of the potential-dependent distributional probe rhodamine 123. Localization studies using tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled histatin 5 or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled histatin 5 showed a granular intracellular distribution of the peptide, which co-localized with mitotracker orange, a permeant mitochondria-specific probe. Like the biological effects, uptake of labeled histatin 5 was inhibited by mitochondrial inhibitors and high salt conditions. Our data indicate that histatin 5 is internalized, and targets to the energized mitochondrion. Histatin 5 is a human basic salivary peptide with strong fungicidal properties in vitro.

It is generally recognized that basic peptides are important constituents of natural defense systems of most living organisms, including bacteria, plants, insects, and mammals. Examples of such antibiotic peptides are magainins, secreted by the skin ofXenopus laevis (1Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5549Crossref Scopus (1999) Google Scholar), defensins from the human neutrophils (2Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 229-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and histatins from human saliva (3Pollock J.J. Denepitiya L. MacKay B.J. Iacono V.J. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 702-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Oppenheim F.G. Yang Y.-C. Diamond R.D. Hyslop D. Offner G.D. Troxler R.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 7472-7477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Common features of anti-microbial peptides, which manifest great diversity in primary structure, are a net positive charge at physiological pH and the ability to adopt amphipathic α-helix and β-sheet conformations in hydrophobic solvents (6Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the activity of these peptides is directed against the cellular membranes, mainly the acidic lipid matrices of the target cells (7Hancock R.E.W. Lehrer R.I. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). In addition, the susceptibility towards some of these peptides is controlled by the metabolic state of the target cell (8Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Nguyen T.-M. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2686-2694PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Daher K.A. Harwig S.S.L. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying this phenomenon, however, is not understood. Olson et al. (10Olson V.L. Hansing R.L. McClary D.O. Can. J. Microbiol. 1977; 23: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported the importance of metabolic activity in the susceptibility of Candida albicans cells to basic proteins, like protamine, by showing that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by chemicals or by genetic mutation, protected the cells against their lethal activity. The requirement for mitochondrial activity was also found for HNP-1, a defensin peptide (11Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Szklarek D. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that energy-dependent processes, e.g.receptor-mediated uptake, or the maintenance of the cell membrane electronegative potential would be implicated in the peptide-mediated killing, but up to now there is no experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism of action of the human salivary antifungal peptide, histatin 5. We found that non-respiring yeast cells were protected against histatin 5 killing activity. In localization studies we identified the energized mitochondrion as the target of histatin 5 in the yeast cell. The direct association with the mitochondrion and the requirement of mitochondrial activity provide a new explanation for the energy-dependent activity of antimicrobial peptides againstC. albicans.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we addressed the mechanism of action of histatin 5, a basic amphipathic antifungal peptide from human saliva. In line with previous observations (20Lendenmann U. Oppenheim F.G. Guggenheim B. Shapiro S. Oral Biology at the Turn of the Century. S. Karger AG, Basel, Switzerland1998: 198-210Google Scholar), we found that FITC-histatin 5 is internalized by C. albicans cells. The uptake is dependent on the metabolic state of the cell, and is directly related to the fungicidal activity of histatin 5. Non-respiring Candidacells are protected against histatin 5 killing activity, against its membrane perturbing activity, and do not internalize the peptide.A direct involvement of the mitochondrion in the killing process is demonstrated by co-localization of histatin 5 with a mitochondria-specific probe, revealing that it binds to mitochondriain situ. In addition, histatin 5 dissipates the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in situ, monitored by rhodamine 123 efflux. Together, these results strongly suggest that killing activity of histatin 5 is directly related to perturbation of the mitochondrial membrane.These results imply the following sequence of events: interaction of histatin 5 with the plasma membrane of the yeast cell, translocation across the plasma membrane, release into the intracellular compartment, followed by targeting to and permeabilization of the mitochondria.Under conditions when histatin 5 was internalized, no labeling of the plasma membrane by TRITC-histatin 5 could be detected (Fig. 7), suggesting that the binding to the plasma membrane is a transient event. Nevertheless, it seems a crucial step in the killing process, since high ionic strength conditions, which have been reported to abolish the initial interaction of basic peptides with fungal cellular membranes (21Iijima R. Kurata S. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12055-12061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prevent both killing and intracellular accumulation of TRITC-histatin 5 (this study).It is still unclear by which mechanism histatin 5 is transported across the fungal membrane into the cytoplasm. It has been suggested that basic peptides bound to the membrane are subsequently electrophoresed into the membrane under the influence of an inside-negative transmembrane potential (6Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Maduke and Roise (22Maduke M. Roise D. Science. 1993; 260: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) described the potential-dependent import into protein-free phospholipid vesicles of synthetic peptides similar in length to histatin 5. Matsuzaki et al. (23Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 24Matsuzaki K. Nakamura A. Murase O. Sugishita K. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2104-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) showed that magainin 2 was inserted and translocated across artificial phospholipid bilayers to the inner leaflet. These studies suggest that translocation and internalization of basic peptides would be possible without the intervention of membrane-bound permeases. Apparently, from our results, translocation of histatin 5 is attended with the concomitant influx of propidium iodide, suggesting that the uptake of histatin 5 leads to plasma membrane perturbations.With regard to the targeting of histatin 5 to the mitochondria, it is important to note that histatin 5 shows structural and functional resemblances with mitochondrial presequences, i.e. terminal amino acid extensions that target mitochondrial proteins from the cytosol to the mitochondrion. Like histatin 5 and other basic antimicrobial peptides, these matrix-targeting sequences of mitochondrial precursor proteins are basic peptides and adapt amphipathic helical structures in hydrophobic environments (25Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. van Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is believed that the divalent negative phospholipid cardiolipin, which is abundantly present in the mitochondrial membrane, especially supports the initial attraction of mitochondrial presequences (25Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. van Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The same mechanism may apply for histatin 5.The insertion process of mitochondrial presequences into the mitochondrion has been shown to be independent of mitochondrial surface proteins (26Furuya S. Mihara K. Aimoto S. Omura T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and to occur in a potential-dependent manner (22Maduke M. Roise D. Science. 1993; 260: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Roise D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has been reported that an inside-negative membrane potential also enhances the activity of membrane-directed basic antimicrobial peptides against living bacterial cells (28McAuliffe O. Ryan M.P. Ross R.P. Hill C. Breeuwer P. Abee T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 439-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), against isolated energized mitochondria (29Westerhoff H.V. Juretic D. Hendler R.W. Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6597-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and against model membrane vesicles (23Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that factors that diminish the mitochondrial transmembrane potential will reduce histatin 5 binding and the cytotoxic consequences. This is in agreement with our results that the presence of a mitochondrial transmembrane potential is a prerequisite for the antifungal activity of histatin 5, as revealed by the protective efficacy of mitochondrial inhibitors or anaerobic conditions. Previously, Lehrer et al. (11Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Szklarek D. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) demonstrated that respiratory activity was necessary to sensitize C. albicansblastoconidia to the lethal effects of a defensin peptide HNP-1, suggesting a mechanism of antifungal action similar to that of histatin 5. Interestingly, it was found recently that cardiolipin, which is enriched in the mitochondria, plays a key role in the membrane perturbing activity of rabbit neutrophil defensins (30Hristova K. Selsted M.E. White S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24224-24233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Nicolay et al. (25Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. van Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated the destructive effect of amphipathic peptides derived from the presequence of the cytochromec oxidase subunit IV on the permeability barrier of isolated mitochondria. These peptides also display antimicrobial activity (31Hugosson M. Andreu D. Boman H.G. Glaser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Likewise, Westerhoff et al. (29Westerhoff H.V. Juretic D. Hendler R.W. Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6597-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 32Westerhoff H.V. Hendler R.W. Zasloff M. Juretic D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) showed that magainins dissipated the membrane potential of isolated rat liver mitochondria and postulated that this would be the mechanism of antibacterial activity, because of the similar organization of membrane-linked energy coupling in bacteria and mitochondria. Whether these antimicrobial peptides share other mechanistic properties with mitochondrial presequences, like translocation to the mitochondrial inner membrane and processing by proteolytic enzymes, are interesting subjects for further study.Based on our results, we propose that the energized mitochondrion, which might be considered as an endosymbiont of bacterial origin (33Margulis L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), is the cellular target of histatin 5. This may offer a unifying principle for the mechanism of action of basic antifungal peptides that depend on active cell metabolism. It is generally recognized that basic peptides are important constituents of natural defense systems of most living organisms, including bacteria, plants, insects, and mammals. Examples of such antibiotic peptides are magainins, secreted by the skin ofXenopus laevis (1Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Common features of anti-microbial peptides, which manifest great diversity in primary structure, are a net positive charge at physiological pH and the ability to adopt amphipathic α-helix and β-sheet conformations in hydrophobic solvents (6Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the activity of these peptides is directed against the cellular membranes, mainly the acidic lipid matrices of the target cells (7Hancock R.E.W. Lehrer R.I. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 82-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). In addition, the susceptibility towards some of these peptides is controlled by the metabolic state of the target cell (8Lichtenstein A.K. Ganz T. Nguyen T.-M. Selsted M.E. Lehrer R.I. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2686-2694PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Daher K.A. Harwig S.S.L. Ganz T. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying this phenomenon, however, is not understood. Olson et al. (10Olson V.L. Hansing R.L. McClary D.O. Can. J. Microbiol. 1977; 23: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported the importance of metabolic activity in the susceptibility of Candida albicans cells to basic proteins, like protamine, by showing that uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation by chemicals or by genetic mutation, protected the cells against their lethal activity. The requirement for mitochondrial activity was also found for HNP-1, a defensin peptide (11Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Szklarek D. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that energy-dependent processes, e.g.receptor-mediated uptake, or the maintenance of the cell membrane electronegative potential would be implicated in the peptide-mediated killing, but up to now there is no experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism of action of the human salivary antifungal peptide, histatin 5. We found that non-respiring yeast cells were protected against histatin 5 killing activity. In localization studies we identified the energized mitochondrion as the target of histatin 5 in the yeast cell. The direct association with the mitochondrion and the requirement of mitochondrial activity provide a new explanation for the energy-dependent activity of antimicrobial peptides againstC. albicans. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we addressed the mechanism of action of histatin 5, a basic amphipathic antifungal peptide from human saliva. In line with previous observations (20Lendenmann U. Oppenheim F.G. Guggenheim B. Shapiro S. Oral Biology at the Turn of the Century. S. Karger AG, Basel, Switzerland1998: 198-210Google Scholar), we found that FITC-histatin 5 is internalized by C. albicans cells. The uptake is dependent on the metabolic state of the cell, and is directly related to the fungicidal activity of histatin 5. Non-respiring Candidacells are protected against histatin 5 killing activity, against its membrane perturbing activity, and do not internalize the peptide.A direct involvement of the mitochondrion in the killing process is demonstrated by co-localization of histatin 5 with a mitochondria-specific probe, revealing that it binds to mitochondriain situ. In addition, histatin 5 dissipates the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in situ, monitored by rhodamine 123 efflux. Together, these results strongly suggest that killing activity of histatin 5 is directly related to perturbation of the mitochondrial membrane.These results imply the following sequence of events: interaction of histatin 5 with the plasma membrane of the yeast cell, translocation across the plasma membrane, release into the intracellular compartment, followed by targeting to and permeabilization of the mitochondria.Under conditions when histatin 5 was internalized, no labeling of the plasma membrane by TRITC-histatin 5 could be detected (Fig. 7), suggesting that the binding to the plasma membrane is a transient event. Nevertheless, it seems a crucial step in the killing process, since high ionic strength conditions, which have been reported to abolish the initial interaction of basic peptides with fungal cellular membranes (21Iijima R. Kurata S. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12055-12061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prevent both killing and intracellular accumulation of TRITC-histatin 5 (this study).It is still unclear by which mechanism histatin 5 is transported across the fungal membrane into the cytoplasm. It has been suggested that basic peptides bound to the membrane are subsequently electrophoresed into the membrane under the influence of an inside-negative transmembrane potential (6Hancock R.E.W. Lancet. 1997; 349: 418-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Maduke and Roise (22Maduke M. Roise D. Science. 1993; 260: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) described the potential-dependent import into protein-free phospholipid vesicles of synthetic peptides similar in length to histatin 5. Matsuzaki et al. (23Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 24Matsuzaki K. Nakamura A. Murase O. Sugishita K. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2104-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) showed that magainin 2 was inserted and translocated across artificial phospholipid bilayers to the inner leaflet. These studies suggest that translocation and internalization of basic peptides would be possible without the intervention of membrane-bound permeases. Apparently, from our results, translocation of histatin 5 is attended with the concomitant influx of propidium iodide, suggesting that the uptake of histatin 5 leads to plasma membrane perturbations.With regard to the targeting of histatin 5 to the mitochondria, it is important to note that histatin 5 shows structural and functional resemblances with mitochondrial presequences, i.e. terminal amino acid extensions that target mitochondrial proteins from the cytosol to the mitochondrion. Like histatin 5 and other basic antimicrobial peptides, these matrix-targeting sequences of mitochondrial precursor proteins are basic peptides and adapt amphipathic helical structures in hydrophobic environments (25Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. van Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is believed that the divalent negative phospholipid cardiolipin, which is abundantly present in the mitochondrial membrane, especially supports the initial attraction of mitochondrial presequences (25Nicolay K. Laterveer F.D. van Heerde W.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The same mechanism may apply for histatin 5.The insertion process of mitochondrial presequences into the mitochondrion has been shown to be independent of mitochondrial surface proteins (26Furuya S. Mihara K. Aimoto S. Omura T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and to occur in a potential-dependent manner (22Maduke M. Roise D. Science. 1993; 260: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Roise D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It has been reported that an inside-negative membrane potential also enhances the activity of membrane-directed basic antimicrobial peptides against living bacterial cells (28McAuliffe O. Ryan M.P. Ross R.P. Hill C. Breeuwer P. Abee T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 439-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), against isolated energized mitochondria (29Westerhoff H.V. Juretic D. Hendler R.W. Zasloff M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6597-6601Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and against model membrane vesicles (23Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that factors that diminish the mitochondrial transmembrane potential will reduce histatin 5 binding and the cytotoxic consequences. This is in agreement with our results that the presence of a mitochondrial transmembrane potential is a prerequisite for the antifungal activity of histatin 5, as revealed by the protective efficacy of mitochondrial inhibitors or anaerobic conditions. Previously, Lehrer et al. (11Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Szklarek D. Selsted M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1829-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) demonstrated that respiratory activity was necessary to sensitize C. albicansblastoconidia to the lethal effects of a defensin peptide HNP-1, suggesting a mechanism of antifungal action similar to that of histatin 5. Interestingly, it was found recently that cardiolipin, which is enriched in the mitochondria, plays a key role in the membrane perturbing activity of rabbit neutrophil defensins (30Hristova K.

Whether these antimicrobial peptides share other mechanistic properties with mitochondrial presequences, like translocation to the mitochondrial inner membrane and processing by proteolytic enzymes, are interesting subjects for further study.Based on our results, we propose that the energized mitochondrion, which might be considered as an endosymbiont of bacterial origin (33Margulis L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), is the cellular target of histatin 5. This may offer a unifying principle for the mechanism of action of basic antifungal peptides that depend on active cell metabolism. In this study, we addressed the mechanism of action of histatin 5, a basic amphipathic antifungal peptide from human saliva. In line with previous observations (20Lendenmann U. Oppenheim F.G.

https://openalex.org/W2087871321,"Signaling induced by interaction between the receptor Notch and its ligand Delta plays an important role in cell fate determination in vertebrates as well as invertebrates. Vertebrate Notch signaling has been investigated using its constitutively active form, i.e. the truncated intracellular region which is believed to mimic Notch-Delta signaling by interaction with a DNA-binding protein RBP-J. However, the molecular mechanism for Notch signaling triggered by ligand binding, which leads to inhibition of differentiation, is not clear. We have established a myeloma cell line expressing mouse Delta1 on its cell surface which can block muscle differentiation by co-culture with C2C12 muscle progenitor cells. We showed that Delta-induced Notch signaling stimulated transcriptional activation of RBP-J binding motif, containing promoters including the HES1 promoter. Furthermore, ligand-induced Notch signaling up-regulated HES1 mRNA expression within 1 h and subsequently reduced expression of MyoD mRNA. Since cycloheximide treatment did not inhibit induction of HES1 mRNA, the HES1 promoter appears to be a primary target of activated Notch. In addition, a transcriptionally active form of RBP-J, i.e. VP16-RBP-J, inhibited muscle differentiation of C2C12 cells by blocking the expression of MyoD protein. These results suggest that HES1 induction by the Delta1/Notch signaling is mediated by RBP-J and blocks myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells by subsequent inhibition of MyoD expression.

There are two subfamilies of ligands: Delta and Serrate which are expressed at different sites and time points duringDrosophila embryogenesis (9Heitzler P. Simpson P.

Fleming R.J. Development. 1995; 121: 855-865PubMed Google Scholar), it is not clear whetherDelta and Serrate have identical functions in Notch signaling. Fibroblasts expressing the mammalian homologue (Jagged) of Serrate can inhibit differentiation of C2C12 myoblast cells that express either endogenous Notch alone or both endogenous and transgene-derived Notch (15Lindsell C.E.

In addition, it is not known whether mammalian Delta has a similar function. The mechanism of signal transduction through the Notch receptor is still unclear.

Development. 1995; 121: 3291-3301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed somewhat similar phenotypes including defects in somite formation. Expression of the truncated intracellular region (IC) of mNotch can induce transactivation through the HES1 promoter carrying the RBP-J binding motif (25Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar) and suppress neurogenesis and myogenesis in mammalian cultured cells (26Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. Development. 1994; 120: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nye J.S. Kopan R. Axel R. Development. 1994; 120: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the entire intracellular region (RAMIC) as well as IC of mNotch was shown to suppress myogenic differentiation by transactivation of genes that contain the RBP-J binding motif in their promoters (28Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with these results, interaction of Notch with its ligand is likely to cause proteolytic cleavage of Notch, resulting in the release of RAMIC or IC that binds to RBP-J in the nucleus to activate genes involved in differentiation suppression (7Tamura K.

However, involvement of RBP-J in Notch signaling was shown by using RAMIC or IC but not the intact Notch receptor. It is critical to test whether Notch signaling from cell surface also utilizes RBP-J because there are few reports that suggest the presence of RBP-J-independent Notch signaling pathways (20Matsuno K. Go M.J. Sun X. Eastman D.S. Artavanis Tsakonas S. Development. 1997; 124: 4265-4273PubMed Google Scholar, 31Shawber C. Nofziger D. Hsieh J.J. Lindsell C. Bogler O. Hayward D. Weinmaster G. Development. 1996; 122: 3765-3773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The muscle cell differentiation is determined by the MyoD family of myogenic transcriptional regulators (MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF4) that belong to the basic helix loop helix type of DNA-binding proteins (32Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Myotube formation of C2C12 myoblast cells (33Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 34Blau H.M. Chiu C.P. Webster C. Cell. 1983; 32: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) is frequently used as a model to study regulation of myogenic differentiation. C2C12 cells generally express MyoD, myf-5, or both (35Braun T. Bober E. Buschhausen Denker G. Kohtz S. Grzeschik K.H. Arnold H.H. Kotz S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3617-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 36Braun T. Buschhausen Denker G. Bober E. Tannich E. Arnold H.H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Upon differentiation induction of C2C12 cells, a more downstream transcription factor myogenin is up-regulated, followed by expression of muscle structural genes such as myosin and muscle creatine kinase. C2C12 cell differentiation is inhibited by expression of RAMIC or IC (26Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. Development. 1994; 120: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is accompanied by down-regulation of myogenin (31Shawber C. Nofziger D. Hsieh J.J. Lindsell C. Bogler O. Hayward D. Weinmaster G. Development. 1996; 122: 3765-3773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hsieh J.J. Nofziger D.E. Weinmaster G. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1938-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been entirely unknown how Notch signaling blocks myogenin expression and subsequently myogenic differentiation. The facts that overexpression of a basic helix loop helix protein HES1 in 10T1/2 cells blocks differentiation into myotube (38Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) and that transcriptional activity through the HES1 promoter is up-regulated by Notch ΔE (25Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), RAMIC, or IC (28Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) led to speculation that Notch signaling induces expression of HES1 which somehow suppresses expression of myogenic transcription factors. Here we report that Delta1-expressing myeloma cells can suppress myogenesis of C2C12 cells first by up-regulation of HES1 mRNA, followed by blocking expression of MyoD mRNA. Ligand-induced Notch signaling was shown to involve RBP-J. It is, therefore, likely that the ligand-induced Notch signaling transactivates the HES1 gene that is regulated by RBP-J and involved in regulation of MyoD expression. Total RNA from mouse embryo (day 11.5) was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). Four pairs of specific primers were used for PCR amplification of partial cDNA clones of mouse Delta1 (39Bettenhausen B. Hrabe de Angelis M. Simon D. Guenet J.L. Gossler A. Development. 1995; 121: 2407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): pair 1, 5′-GAATCTAGAATGGGCCGTCGGAGCGCGCTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCTGTGCGGCCGCTACTGT-3′ (reverse); pair 2, 5′-ACAGTAGCGGCCGCACAGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCATGGCGCTCAGCTCACAGA-3′ (reverse); pair 3, 5′-TCTGTGAGCTGAGCGCCATGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGCGCTGGCAATTGGCTAGGT-3′ (reverse); pair 4, 5′-ACCTAGCCAATTGCCAGCGCGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTGGATCCTCTAGATTAGCGACCCATTTGCTGTCCACCAGTCATGCTAGCCATCACCTCAGTCGCTAT-3′ (reverse). The reverse primer of pair 4 contains a single gene 10 epitope tag (Novagen). The PCR products were cloned into the T-vector (Promega) and overlapping partial cDNA clones were assembled in pBluescript KS+. The assembled Delta1-gene 10 fragment was subsequently subcloned into the plasmid pEF-BOS neo-derived from pEF-BOS (40Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) and pMC1neo poly(A) (Stratagene) for expression in X63 myeloma cells. X63 cells were transfected with the pEF-BOS neo/Delta1-gene 10 by electroporation and selecting in RPMI 1640 (JRH Bioscience) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and neomycin (0.3 mg/ml). A cDNA fragment encoding the signal sequence of human immunoglobulin VH3–30 was amplified with primers; 5′-ATGGAATTCACCCTGCAGCTCTGGGAGAGGAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTAGAGCTCACACTGGACACCTCTTAAAAGAGC-3′ (reverse) (41Matsuda F.

A cDNA fragment encoding the extracellular region (EGF 11–12) of the mouse Notch1 protein was amplified with primers, 5′-ATGGAGCTCGACACCACCCCTGTCAACGGCAAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCGGGATCCGCGCAGTGGCCATTGTGCAGACA-3′ (reverse) (42de Celis J.F. Barrio R. del Arco A. Garcia Bellido A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4037-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These fragments were subcloned into the pUC19 vector containing human IgG1constant region (43Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). The Notch-IgG1 fusion (MNE-Rg4) construct was subsequently subcloned into the expression plasmid pEF-BOS (MNE-Rg4/pEF-BOS) (40Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). MNE-Rg4/pEF-BOS plasmid was transfected into COS7 cells using DEAE dextran. MNE-Rg4 chimeric protein was purified from culture supernatants by RROSEP-A High Capacity (Bioprocessing). Total RNA was extracted form cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). 15 or 30 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham). cDNA probes of MyoD (nucleotides 112 to 1162)(44), myogenin (nucleotides 513 to 1104) (45Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nabeshima Y. Hosoda Y. Obinata T. Nabeshima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15219-15223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MLC2 (nucleotides 66 to 553, GenBank U77943), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (nucleotides 566 to 1016, GenBank U32599) were obtained by RT-PCR from appropriate cDNA pools. HES-1 probe was a 1.4-kilobase pair EcoRI fragment isolated from pSV-CMV-HES-1 (38Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were done under standard conditions (46Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The full-length mouse RBP-J cDNA (47Matsunami N. Hamaguchi Y. Yamamoto Y. Kuze K. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Kawaichi M. Honjo T. Nature. 1989; 342: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pCMX (48Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) vectors to generate pCMX-mRBP-J and pCMX-VP16-mRBP-J, respectively. C2C12 cells were plated on coverslides, transfected with either of the mRBP-J plasmids by lipofection, and cultured in differentiation medium for 24 h. For MyoD rescue assay, C2C12 cells were transfected with pHβAPr-1 or pHβA-D(+) (45Fujisawa-Sehara A. Nabeshima Y. Hosoda Y. Obinata T. Nabeshima Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15219-15223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,50Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S.Y. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) and co-cultured with D10 cells in differentiation medium for 4 days. The cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (28Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were then incubated with anti-MyoD mouse monoclonal antibody (51Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), anti-RBP-J rat monoclonal antibody (K0043) that detects both mRBP-J and VP16-mRBP-J (52Sakai T. Furukawa T. Iwanari H. Oka C. Nakano T. Kawaichi M. Honjo T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and anti-myoglobin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cappel). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cappel), TRITC-labeled anti-rat IgG antibody, and TRITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology) were subsequently used for indirect fluorescence staining. Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) was used for nuclear staining. Slides were mounted in SlowFade Light Antifade Kit Component A (Molecular Probes) and viewed with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. To examine the role of mouse Delta1 in differentiation regulation, we first constructed a Delta1 transfectant (D10) of the mouse X63 myeloma cell line which expresses a full-length mouse Delta1-tagged C-terminal with the gene 10 epitope sequence. We also produced a fusion protein consisting of EGF repeats 11 and 12 of mNotch1 followed by the Fc portion of human IgG1 (MNE-Rg4) to monitor surface expression of the Delta1 protein on D10 cells (43Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar,53Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis showed that MNE-Rg4 bound strongly to the cell surface of D10 cells but not to parental X63 cells (Fig. 1A), indicating that D10 cells express a large number of Delta1 molecules which can bind to mNotch1. When C2C12 cells were cultured in differentiation media in the presence or absence of X63 cells, C2C12 cells differentiated normally and fused into multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 1, C and E). In contrast, C2C12 cells co-cultured with D10 cells showed drastic reduction of myotube formation (Fig. 1G). C2C12 myoblasts have been shown to express endogenous Notch receptors (16Luo B. Aster J.C. Hasserjian R.P. Kuo F. Sklar J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6057-6067Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). 2K. Kuroda, H. Katou, H. Kurooka, and T. Honjo, unpublished data. To further explore the molecular mechanism for differentiation suppression of C2C12 cells co-cultured with D10 cells, we examined expression of muscle lineage-specific genes such as MyoD, myogenin, and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) before and 24 h after differentiation induction. When C2C12 cells were co-cultured with X63 cells, high level expression of MyoD mRNA was maintained before and after differentiation induction. Myf-5 was not detected in this particular C2C12 cell (data not shown). Expression of mRNAs for myogenin and MLC2 was induced after differentiation induction (Fig. 2). C2C12 cells co-cultured with D10 cells markedly decreased expression of MyoD mRNA in concomitant inhibition of myogenin and MLC2 mRNAs induction. These results indicate that the mouse Delta1 serves as the functional ligand for Notch and their interaction inhibits myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells by blocking expression of MyoD mRNA. HES1 was suggested to be a direct target of Notch signaling by co-transfection experiments (25Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar) and reported to inhibit MyoD-induced myogenesis of 10T1/2 cells (38Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether HES1 mRNA was up-regulated in differentiation-induced C2C12 cells by co-culture with D10 cells. HES1 mRNA was rapidly up-regulated about 2.5 times by co-culture with D10 cells, followed by down-modulation of MyoD mRNA (Fig. 3, A-C). By contrast, the HES1 mRNA level was not changed by co-culture with X63 cells (Fig. 3,A-C). A slight down-regulation of MyoD mRNA by X63 cells appears to be caused by serum deprivation (54Yoshida N. Yoshida S. Koishi K. Masuda K. Nabeshima Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 769-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments indicate that Delta1 inhibits myogenesis of C2C12 cells by suppressing MyoD mRNA expression with up-regulating expression of HES1 mRNA. As the Delta1-induced decrease of MyoD mRNA rapidly followed the up-regulation of HES1 mRNA, MyoD could be regulated by HES1 in C2C12 cells as previously suggested (38Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). To determine whether induction of HES1 mRNA expression requires protein synthesis, C2C12 cells were co-cultured with D10 cells in differentiation medium in the presence of 10 μm cycloheximide. The cycloheximide treatment blocked the decrease of MyoD mRNA expression but not the increase of HES1 mRNA in C2C12 cells by co-culture with D10 cells (Fig. 4). In fact, HES1 mRNA expression was augmented about 16 times by co-culture with D10 cells in the presence of cycloheximide. Furthermore, the block of protein synthesis also stimulated the increase of HES1 mRNA (about 2.8 times) by co-culture with X63 cells (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the HES1 gene is regulated not only directly by activated Notch and RBP-J without synthesis of intermediate regulatory molecules, but also negatively by the HES1 protein per se in agreement with the previous report (55Takebayashi K. Sasai Y. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although Notch signaling by overexpression of Notch IC or RAMIC has been shown to activate transcription mediated by RBP-J, it has not been shown whether ligand-induced Notch signaling also transactivates RBP-J. We therefore examined whether Notch signaling in C2C12 cells triggered by co-culture with D10 cells up-regulates RBP-J-mediated transcription. To monitor RBP-J-mediated transcription, we used the Tp1 and HES1 promoters that carry RBP-J-binding sites and are transactivated by overexpression of the mNotch1 RAMIC (25Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 28Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Kato H. Sakai T. Tamura K. Minoguchi S. Shirayoshi Y. Hamada Y. Tsujimoto Y. Honjo T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,57Sakai T. Taniguchi Y. Tamura K. Minoguchi S. Fukuhara T. Strobl L.J. Zimber-Strobl U. Bornkamm G.W. Honjo T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6034-6099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C2C12 cells were transfected with Tp1-luciferase (pGa981–6) or the HES1-luciferase reporter plasmid (ptk-HES1) and co-cultured with either X63 or D10 cells. C2C12 cells co-cultured with D10 cells showed that transcription from the HES1 promoter was severalfold enhanced as compared with that of X63 cells (Fig. 5A). A small level enhancement of the HES1 promoter activity may be due to negative autoregulation by endogenous HES1 in C2C12 cells, because the HES1 promoter contains the N-box for HES1 binding (55Takebayashi K. Sasai Y. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To avoid this complication, we used the Tp1 promoter which contained only the RBP-J-binding site. C2C12 cells co-cultured with increasing numbers of D10 cells showed markedly enhanced transcriptional activities through the Tp1 promoter in parallel with the number of the D10 cells added (Fig. 5B). By contrast, C2C12 cells co-cultured with X63 cells showed negligible levels of transcriptional activity through the Tp1 promoter. Essentially the same results were obtained regardless of the culture media used, i.e. for differentiation or growth. To further confirm that RBP-J is involved in transactivation through the Tp1 promoter by ligand-induced Notch signaling, excess amounts of RBP-J constructs were co-transfected with the Tp1 reporter plasmid into C2C12 cells because excess amounts of RBP-J have been shown to inhibit transcriptional activity through the Tp1 promoter by RAMIC (28Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Sakai T. Taniguchi Y. Tamura K. Minoguchi S. Fukuhara T. Strobl L.J. Zimber-Strobl U. Bornkamm G.W. Honjo T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6034-6099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, excess RBP-J significantly reduced the transcriptional activity through the Tp1 promoter in C2C12 cells co-cultured with D10 cells (Fig. 5C). Excess RBP-J reduced marginally the basal transactivation activity of the Tp1 promoter in C2C12 cells co-cultured with X63 cells. These results indicate that interaction of Delta1 on D10 cells with the receptor Notch on C2C12 cells leads to RBP-J-mediated transactivation of the HES1 and Tp1 promoters. A fusion protein of human RBP-J with a viral transactivation domain VP16, hRBP-J-VP16 (58Waltzer L. Bourillot P.Y. Sergeant A. Manet E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4939-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), has been shown to markedly suppress myogenesis of C2C12 cells (28Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We showed above that ligand-dependent Notch signaling suppressed MyoD mRNA expression and enhanced RBP-J-dependent transcription of HES1 mRNA in C2C12 cells (Figs. 1, 2, and 5). To examine whether inhibition of MyoD expression by Notch-Delta interaction is mediated through RBP-J, we transfected the active form of mouse RBP-J, VP16-mRBP-J into C2C12 cells, and measured expression of MyoD (green) and VP16-mRBP-J (red) by two-color immunocytostaining (Fig. 6). There are few overlaps of green (MyoD) and red (VP16-mRBP-J) staining (Fig. 6, I-K), showing that MyoD expression was suppressed in VP16-mRBP-J positive cells. The frequency of MyoD+ cells was markedly reduced by VP16-mRBP-J expression as compared with control cells transfected with the vector alone (TableI). In contrast, there are many overlaps of green and red staining (Fig. 6, E-G) and no reduction of MyoD expressing cells by mRBP-J expression, showing that MyoD expression was not inhibited in wild type mRBP-J positive cells (TableI). These results indicate that the activated RBP-J also suppresses MyoD expression in C2C12 cells.Table IVP16-RBP-J inhibits expression of MyoD in C2C12 cellsTransfected constructsNumber of nucleiRBP-J+MyoD+RBP-J+ MyoD−%pCMX-N25437.0aOnly MyoD expression was scored.63.0aOnly MyoD expression was scored.mRBP-J12340.359.3VP16-mRBP-J12012.587.5Staining was done 24 h after differentiation induction as described in the legend to Fig. 6.a Only MyoD expression was scored. Open table in a new tab Staining was done 24 h after differentiation induction as described in the legend to Fig. 6. To further confirm that Delta1-induced inhibition of MyoD expression is involved in myogenic suppression, we constitutively expressed MyoD in C2C12 cells and co-cultured with D10 cells. To monitor rescue of myogenic suppression, two-color immunocytostaining experiments that detect expression of both MyoD and myoglobin were carried out (Fig. 7). C2C12 cells expressing MyoD differentiated into myoglobin expressing cells despite co-culture with D10 cells (Fig. 7, E-G). These data indicate that down-regulation of MyoD is the major cause in Delta1-induced myogenic suppression of C2C12 cells. The skeletal muscle cell differentiation is controlled by basic helix loop helix transcriptional regulators (MyoD, Myf-5, myogenin, and MRF4) that belong to the MyoD family (32Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Previous experiments showed that truncated mNotch1 (IC) inhibits MyoD- or Myf-5-dependent transcriptional activity of E-box-containing promoters (26Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. Development. 1994; 120: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that ligand-induced Notch signaling down-regulates expression of myogenin (15Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 31Shawber C. Nofziger D. Hsieh J.J. Lindsell C. Bogler O. Hayward D. Weinmaster G. Development. 1996; 122: 3765-3773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a direct target of ligand-induced Notch signaling was unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated that Delta1-induced Notch signaling mediated by RBP-J induces directly expression of HES1. Furthermore, the Delta1-induced Notch signaling or the activated form of mRBP-J (VP16-mRBP-J) inhibited expression of MyoD in C2C12 cells and their myogenic differentiation. Taken together with the previous report that HES1 down-regulates MyoD-dependent transcriptional activity of E-box-containing promoters and inhibits the MyoD-induced myogenic conversion of 10T1/2 cells (38Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), Delta-Notch interaction is likely to induce HES1 which then down-regulates MyoD, resulting in inhibition of myogenesis. The mammalian ligands of Notch can be divided into two groups, Delta and Serrate/Jagged (1Artavanis Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 8Weinmaster G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Previously only Jagged was shown to function as a ligand of Notch (15Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 16Luo B. Aster J.C. Hasserjian R.P. Kuo F. Sklar J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6057-6067Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This is the first report that Delta1 can interact with Notch and deliver a differentiation suppression signal in mammalian cultured cells. We have shown that Delta1 can bind to Notch1 (Fig. 1A), but this observation does not exclude the possibility that Delta1 interacts also with other Notch family members (Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4). It is not clear that Delta and Jagged have the identical function including preference among the Notch family members. Su(H) has been shown to be involved in Notch signaling by extensive genetic studies in Drosophila. RBP-J has been shown to mediate differentiation suppression activity of RAMIC and IC (28Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2, which physically associates with RBP-J, can also suppress differentiation of C2C12 cells (57Sakai T. Taniguchi Y. Tamura K. Minoguchi S. Fukuhara T. Strobl L.J. Zimber-Strobl U. Bornkamm G.W. Honjo T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6034-6099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, involvement of RBP-J in ligand-induced Notch signaling has not been demonstrated. In this study we showed that RBP-J is involved in Delta1-induced Notch signaling because (a) it activated the transactivation activity of the HES1 and Tp1 promoters containing RBP-J-binding motifs, (b) this activity was blocked by excess amounts of RBP-J, and finally (c) the activated form of RBP-J inhibited both MyoD transcription and differentiation of C2C12 cells into myotubes (28Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) just like Delta1-induced Notch signaling. This conclusion is supported by the gene targeting results: Delta1−/− (21Hrabe de Angelis M. McIntyre J.N. Gossler A. Nature. 1997; 386: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar),Notch1 −/−(22, 23), and RBP-J−/− (24Oka C. Nakano T. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Mori C. Sakai T. Okazaki S. Kawaichi M. Shiota K. Mak T.W. Honjo T. Development. 1995; 121: 3291-3301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mutant mice all affected somite formation. Although RBP-J has been suggested to be a transcriptional repressor (59Hsieh J.J. Hayward S.D. Science. 1995; 268: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), overexpression of RBP-J per se did not affect the MyoD expression in C2C12 cells (Fig. 6; Table I). The 7.0-kilobase pair upstream region of the mouse MyoD gene (60Asakura A. Fujisawa Sehara A. Komiya T. Nabeshima Y. Nabeshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7153-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) does not contain RBP-J-binding sites.2 In addition, the cycloheximide treatment blocked the Notch signaling induced MyoD suppression in C2C12 cells (Fig. 4). It is, therefore, unlikely that the MyoDgene is the direct target of Notch/RBP-J signaling. Since VP16-mRBP-J has a strong transcriptional activity, at least one molecule that inhibits the MyoD expression would be induced by Notch/RBP-J signaling in C2C12 cells. Negative regulators of myogenesis, such as the Id and HES families, inhibit the transcriptional activity of the MyoD family (38Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 61Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). HES1 belongs to the basic helix loop helix protein family whose members have been shown to antagonize the function of other basic helix loop helix proteins such as MyoD (38Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Since RAMIC or IC of mNotch1 acts as a transcriptional activator of the HES1 promoter that contains the RBP-J-binding sites in HeLa (25Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar), and COS7 (28Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H. Minoguchi S. Sakai T. Nomura Okazaki S. Tamura K. Honjo T. Development. 1997; 124: 4133-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and C2C12 (data not shown) cells, HES1 is assumed to be responsible for blocking myogenesis by Notch1 signaling (25Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 62Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 63Kageyama R. Nakanishi S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Ligand-induced Notch signaling enhances HES1 promoter activity and up-regulates HES1 mRNA expression quickly and transiently in C2C12 cells, which is followed by the reduction of MyoD mRNA expression (Figs. 3 and 4). We also confirmed that co-culture with mouse Jagged1-expressing cells up-regulates HES1 mRNA expression and subsequently reduces MyoD mRNA expression in C2C12 cells.2 Since Delta-induced HES1 mRNA augmentation is not blocked but rather stimulated by the cycloheximide treatment, the HES1 gene is at least one of the primary target genes in the Notch/RBP-J signaling pathway in C2C12 cells. The results also support the previous report that the HES1 gene is negatively autoregulated (55Takebayashi K. Sasai Y. Sakai Y. Watanabe T. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5150-5156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A small and transient up-regulation of HES1 can strongly down-regulate MyoD expression because the MyoD gene is positively autoregulated (64Thayer M.J. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 241-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The conclusion that HES1 is the direct target of Notch/RBP-J signaling does not agree with the previous findings that HES1 expression is unaltered in mouse embryos with the RBP-J−/−genotype (65de la Pompa J.L. Wakeham A. Correia K.M. Samper E. Brown S. Aguilera R.J. Nakano T. Honjo T. Mak T.W. Rossant J. Conlon R.A. Development. 1997; 124: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that knockout mice with the HES1−/− genotype are affected in neurogenesis but not in myogenesis (66Ishibashi M. Ang S.L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). An explanation to reconcile these results would be that direct target genes other than HES1 may be involved in the Notch/RBP-J signaling pathway. Finally, the RBP-J protein is ubiquitously expressed (67Hamaguchi Y. Yamamoto Y. Iwanari H. Maruyama S. Furukawa T. Matsunami N. Honjo T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), commonly used by the Notch family members (56Kato H. Sakai T. Tamura K. Minoguchi S. Shirayoshi Y. Hamada Y. Tsujimoto Y. Honjo T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar),2 and directly and uniquely targeted by Notch signaling (24Oka C. Nakano T. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Mori C. Sakai T. Okazaki S. Kawaichi M. Shiota K. Mak T.W. Honjo T. Development. 1995; 121: 3291-3301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 65de la Pompa J.L. Wakeham A. Correia K.M. Samper E. Brown S.

Telomeres consist of repeats of the sequence TTAGGG/CCCTAA at the ends of chromosomes. These DNA repeats are synthesized by enzymatic activity associated with an RNA-protein complex called telomerase (1Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H.

Telomerase activity decreases dramatically during the processes of growth arrest and cell differentiation (4Sharma H.W. Sokoloski J.A. Perez J.R. Maltese J.Y. Sartorelli A.C. Stein C.A. Nichols G.

Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, in most somatic cells, telomerase activity is low or nonexistent, and telomere length decreases with increasing cell divisions; telomere shortening has therefore been proposed to play a role in cellular senescence (7Cooke H.G. Smith B.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Harley C.B. Mutat. Res. 1991; 256: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 9Kim N.W.

The latter hypothesis recently gained strong support from studies showing that the life span of normal human fibroblasts can be extended if they are transfected with a vector encoding the telomerase catalytic subunit (10Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby telomerase activity suppresses cellular senescence has not been established. Apoptosis is a stereotyped form of cell death that occurs in a variety of physiological and pathological settings (11Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 68: 251-306Crossref Scopus (6728) Google Scholar, 12Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, and nuclear chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Biochemical features of apoptosis include loss of plasma membrane phospholipid asymmetry, activation of one or more cysteine proteases of the caspase family, mitochondrial dysfunction, and release of factors from mitochondria that induce nuclear destruction (13Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar, 14Miller D.K. Semin.

During the aging process, damaged senescent cells are eliminated by apoptosis (16Warner H.R. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1997; 35: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Abnormal apoptosis is associated with many different disease states, including cancers, in which apoptosis is suppressed (17Barrett J.C. Annab L.A. Alcorta D. Preston G. Vojta P. Yin Y. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and neurodegenerative disorders, in which apoptosis is enhanced (18Bredesen D.E. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 38: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Because cell immortalization is often associated with both increased telomerase activity (19Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Sci.

Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and increased resistance to apoptosis (21Hetts S.W. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1998; 279: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), we performed experiments aimed at determining whether telomerase actively modulates the cell death process. Control vector-transfected PC12 cells (PC12-V) and PC12 cells stably overexpressing human Bcl-2 (PC12-Bcl2) were established using methods described previously (22Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R.

Cultures were maintained in plastic culture flasks and subcultured onto polyethyleneimine-coated plastic 60-mm dishes for telomerase activity assays, 22-mm2polyethyleneimine-coated glass coverslips for analyses of apoptosis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential, or polyethyleneimine-coated 24-well plates for 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assays. Cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented 10% with heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere). Immediately prior to experimental treatment, the medium was replaced with RPMI medium containing 1% fetal calf serum. 3,3′-Diethyloxadicarbocyanine (DODCB) 1The abbreviations used are: DODCB, 3,3′-diethyloxadicarbocyanine; NGF, nerve growth factor; STS, staurosporine; Aβ, Aβ25–35; Fe2+, FeSO4; TRAP, telomeric repeat amplification protocol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (24Chen W.

Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide telomeric repeat DNA sequence (5′-TTAGGG-3′) and an oligonucleotide with a scrambled sequence (5′-TGTGAG-3′) were purchased from IDT (Coralville, IA) and were prepared as 1 mm stocks in sterile deionized water. The telomerase inhibitors were administered in a 1-h pretreatment and remained in the medium during the rest of the experiment. Staurosporine (STS) was purchased from Sigma and was prepared as a 500× stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. Synthetic amyloid β-peptide 25–35 (Aβ) was purchased from Bachem (Torrence, CA) and was prepared as a 1 mm stock in sterile deionized water 2 h prior to use. FeSO4 (Sigma) was prepared as a 1 mm stock in water. In order to differentiate cells into a neuron-like phenotype, the culture medium was replaced with RPMI medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 50 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF). Following experimental treatments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and membranes were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and stained with the fluorescent DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342 as described previously (23Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hoechst-stained cells were visualized and photographed under epifluorescence illumination (340 nm excitation and 510 nm barrier filter) using a × 60 oil immersion objective (200 cells/culture were counted, and counts were made in at least four separate cultures/treatment condition). Analyses were performed without knowledge of the treatment history of the cultures. The percentage of “apoptotic” cells (cells with condensed and fragmented DNA were considered apoptotic) in each culture was determined. We previously found that this method for assessment of apoptosis is superior to the terminal transferase uridyl nick end-labeling assay (which also detects necrotic cells) and that the death of PC12 cells induced by STS, Fe2+, and Aβ (at the concentrations used in the present study) can be completely blocked by caspase inhibitors and macromolecular synthesis inhibitors (23Kruman I.

Telomerase activity was measured using a polymerase chain reaction-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) as described previously (25Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Piatyszek M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3794-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 26Kim N.W. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2595-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) using a kit from Oncor (Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, cells (105–106cells/culture) were scraped in PBS, pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 400 × g, and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer that contained 0.5% CHAPS, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The lysate was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce). Cell extract (1–200 ng of protein) was added to a reaction mixture containing 10× TRAP buffer (15 mmMgCl2, 630 mm KCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 10 mm EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 200 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3), 50× dNTP mixture (2.5 mm each of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP), TS primer (5′-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT-3′), TRAP primer mixture (Oncor), and 5 units/μl Taq polymerase. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, followed by a 30-min incubation at 30 °C. The mixture was then subjected to 30 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s). Each reaction product was amplified in the presence of a 36-base pair internal TRAP assay standard. Samples were loaded on a 12.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and DNA was electrophoresed through the gel. Gels were stained with SyBr (Molecular Probes), and images were captured using an AlphaImager. For quantification of relative telomerase activity in each sample, the total density of bands 1–10 of the characteristic ladder (band 1 being the band immediately above the internal standard band) was quantified using NIH Image software, and values are expressed relative to a control value as indicated in the figure legends. TRAP assays were performed on serial dilutions of extracts from untreated control PC12 cells in order to establish the linear response range of the assay and to thereby select appropriate protein concentrations for analyses of extracts from cells subjected to experimental treatments. Control reactions included tubes lacking cell extract or containing cell extract treated with 200 μg/ml RNase. The dye rhodamine 123 was used as a measure of mitochondrial transmembrane potential using methods described previously (27Johnson L.V. Walsh M.L. Bokus B.J. Chen L.B. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 28Mattson M.P. Zhang Y. Bose S. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 121: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were incubated for 30 min in RPMI medium containing 5 μm rhodamine 123 and were then washed with Locke's buffer: NaCl, 154 mm; KCl, 5.6 mm; CaCl2, 2.3 mm; MgCl2, 1 mm; NaHCO3, 3.6 mm; glucose, 5 mm; HEPES, 5 mm (pH 7.2). Cellular fluorescence was imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510 nm; cells were selected randomly under bright-field optics and then scanned with the laser. Levels of cellular fluorescence were quantified from the fluorescence images using ImageSpace software (Molecular Dynamics); the fluorescence measurements were made in the entire cell body and are expressed as average pixel intensity/cell body. Measurements were made in at least 40 cells/culture (analyses were performed without knowledge of treatment history of the cultures). Because tumor cells are generally more resistant to apoptosis than are normal cells (21Hetts S.W. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1998; 279: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 23Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and because telomerase activity is increased in tumor cells (19Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Sci. Am. 1996; (February): 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Rhyu M.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we determined whether inhibition of telomerase would modify the cell death process. In order to determine an appropriate concentration of cell extract that would allow reliable quantification of relative levels of telomerase activity in PC12 cells, the basal level of telomerase activity was measured in serial dilutions of PC12 cell extract (1–200 ng). An example of such an assay is shown in Fig. 1A, and values of relative telomerase activity are shown in Fig. 1B. Essentially no bands were detected in TRAP assay samples lacking cell extract, and treatment of the cell extract with RNase prior to TRAP assay completely eliminated telomerase activity, demonstrating specificity of the assay (Fig. 1C). Based upon these results, we used 20–100 ng of PC12 cell extract for subsequent assays. A comparison of relative levels of telomerase activity in HeLa cells (known to exhibit high telomerase activity) and PC12 cells indicated that PC12 cells have a quite high basal level of telomerase activity (Fig. 1C). We next examined the effects of two different putative telomerase inhibitors on telomerase activity in PC12 cells. One inhibitor was the six-base oligonucleotide TTAGGG, which corresponds to the sequence that telomerase adds to telomeres; this oligonucleotide was previously shown to be effective in suppressing telomerase activity in various cultured cell lines (29Morin G.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 30Zahler A.M. Williamson J.R. Chch T. Prescott D.M. Nature. 1991; 350: 718-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 31Mata J.E. Joshi S.S. Palen B. Pirruccello S.J. Jackson J.D. Elias N. Page T.J. Medlin K.L. Iversen P.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The second inhibitor was the compound DODCB, an agent previously shown to bind selectively to dimeric hairpin quadruplexes (24Chen W. Kuntz I.D. Shafer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2635-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and to inhibit telomerase activity. 2W. Fu and M. P. Mattson, unpublished data. As expected, both TTAGGG and DODCB caused decreases in telomerase activity in PC12 cell homogenates (Fig. 1, C and D). A scrambled control oligonucleotide (TGTGAG) had no effect on telomerase activity (data not shown). The IC50 values for DODCB and TTAGGG were approximately 2 and 4 μm, respectively (Fig. 1D). Maximal inhibition of telomerase activity was observed with concentrations of DODCB and TTAGGG in the range of 10–50 μm. DODCB and TTAGGG, at concentrations effective in suppressing telomerase activity (1–10 μm DODCB and 2–20 μm TTAGGG), did not affect the TRAP assay when added immediately prior to the polymerase chain reaction step (data not shown). In order to determine whether telomerase activity influenced the vulnerability of PC12 cells to apoptosis, we employed STS, Aβ, and Fe2+, three agents known to induce apoptosis in PC12 cells (23Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were pretreated with TTAGGG, TGTGAG, or DODCB prior to exposure to STS, Aβ, or Fe2+. Basal levels of apoptosis were approximately 4–5% in vehicle-treated control cultures and were not significantly affected by TTAGGG or DODCB at concentrations (10–20 μm) that inhibited telomerase activity by over 80% (Figs. 1D and 2A), although there was a trend toward an increased basal level of apoptosis in cultures exposed to the telomerase inhibitors (Fig. 2A). Apoptosis induced by each insult (STS, Aβ, and Fe2+) was significantly enhanced in cultures treated TTAGGG and DODCB but not in cultures treated with scrambled DNA (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggested an anti-apoptotic role for telomerase activity. Alterations in mitochondria, including membrane depolarization and release of apoptotic factors, occur prior to nuclear alterations in a variety of cells undergoing apoptosis (13Kroemer G. Zamzami N. Susin S.A. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 44-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). We previously showed that STS, Aβ, and Fe2+ can each induce such mitochondrial alterations in PC12 cells (23Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kruman I. Guo Q. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 51: 293-308Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 34Keller J.N. Kindy M.S.

As expected, STS, Aβ, and Fe2+ each caused mitochondrial membrane depolarization measured as a decrease in levels of rhodamine 123 fluorescence (Fig. 3). The magnitude of the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly greater in PC12 cells treated with TTAGGG or DODCB than in cells treated with vehicle or scrambled DNA (Fig. 3), suggesting that the anti-apoptotic action of telomerase occurs at a step prior to mitochondrial alterations.Figure 3Telomerase inhibitors exacerbate mitochondrial membrane depolarization induced by apoptotic insults in PC12 cells. Cultures of PC12 cells were pretreated for 1 h with saline (vehicle), 20 μm telomeric repeat DNA (TTAGGG), 20 μm scrambled DNA (TGTGAG), or 10 μm DODCB. Cultures were then exposed for 6 h to 0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide (control), 1 μm STS, 20 μm Aβ, or 10 μm Fe2+. Levels of rhodamine 123 fluorescence were quantified, and values are the mean and S.E. of determinations made in four separate cultures. Values for vehicle-treated cells exposed to STS, Aβ, and Fe2+ were significantly less than the corresponding control value (p < 0.01). Values for cells treated with TTAGGG or DODCB and then exposed to STS, Aβ, or Fe2+ were significantly less than corresponding values for cultures treated with STS, Aβ, or Fe2+ alone (p < 0.02). Analysis of variance with Scheffe's post hoc tests was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next determined whether levels of telomerase activity changed in PC12 cells undergoing apoptosis. STS, Aβ, and Fe2+ each caused a time-dependent increase in the number of PC12 cells exhibiting apoptotic nuclei beginning 8 h following treatment and progressing through 24 h (Fig. 4A). Levels of telomerase activity were reduced within 4–8 h of treatment with each apoptotic insult and continued to decrease through 16 h (Fig. 4B). Expression of the proto-oncogene bcl-2 is correlated with resistance of many types of tumor cells to apoptosis, and overexpression of Bcl-2 in cultured cells confers resistance to apoptosis induced by an array of agents, including STS, Aβ, and Fe2+ (35Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 395-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). We previously generated lines of PC12 cells stably overexpressing Bcl-2 and demonstrated their resistance to apoptosis induced by a variety of insults (23Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with a recent study (41Mandel M. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14183-14187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we found that levels of telomerase activity were approximately 2-fold greater in PC12 cells overexpressing Bcl-2 (PC12-Bcl2) compared with vector-transfected control PC12 cells (PC12-V) (levels were 194 ± 8% of the control level; n = 3 cultures). We next quantified levels of apoptosis in PC12-V and PC12-Bcl2 cells following exposure to telomerase inhibitors (TTAGGG and DODCB) in combination with apoptotic insults (STS, Aβ, and Fe2+). PC12 cells overexpressing Bcl-2 were very resistant to apoptosis induced by each insult in the presence of telomerase inhibitors (Fig. 5A), as well as in the absence of telomerase inhibitors (data not shown; see Refs. 23Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 32Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Furukawa K. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the apoptosis-enhancing action of telomerase inhibitors occurs at a stage of the apoptotic cascade prior to that at which Bcl-2 exerts its anti-apoptotic action. Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases play important roles in effecting apoptotic cell death in most, if not all, types of mammalian cells (36Nicholson D. Thornbery N. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar, 37Kidd V.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 533-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether caspase activation played a role in the apoptosis-enhancing actions of telomerase inhibitors, we employed the broad-spectrum irreversible caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (38Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Daugas E. Wang H.G. Geley S. Fassy F. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by STS, Aβ, and Fe2+ was prevented by zVAD-fmk (Fig. 5B). zVAD-fmk also prevented apoptosis in PC12 cells exposed to combinations of TTAGGG or DODCB and each apoptotic insult (Fig. 5B). Collectively, the data suggest that the anti-apoptotic action of telomerase is exerted at a relatively early stage in the cell death process, prior to the points at which Bcl-2 and caspase inhibitors act. Primary differentiated neurons are known to be more vulnerable to apoptosis, induced by a variety of insults, than are various neural tumor cell lines (23Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because cellular differentiation is often associated with a decrease in levels of telomerase activity (4Sharma H.W. Sokoloski J.A. Perez J.R. Maltese J.Y. Sartorelli A.C. Stein C.A. Nichols G. Khaled Z. Telang N.T. Narayanan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12343-12346Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 5Savoysky E. Yoshida K. Ohtomo T. Yamaguchi R. Akamatsu K.

Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Kondo Y. Kondo S. Tanaka Y. Haqqi T. Barna B.P. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2243-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether a relationship exists between vulnerability to apoptosis and telomerase activity in PC12 cells. We first compared the vulnerability of undifferentiated PC12 cells and PC12 cells that had been differentiated into a neuron-like phenotype by treatment with NGF to apoptosis induced by STS and Aβ. Differentiated PC12 cells were significantly more vulnerable than undifferentiated PC12 cells to apoptosis induced by STS and Aβ (Fig. 6). Previous studies have shown that telomerase activity decreases upon differentiation of NT2 teratocarcinoma cells into a neuron-like phenotype in response to treatment with retinoic acid (39Kondo Y. Kondo S. Tanaka Y. Haqqi T. Barna B.P. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2243-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We obtained similar results in PC12 cells following exposure to NGF, a treatment that induces differentiation of PC12 cells into a neuron-like phenotype. Following exposure to NGF, there was a progressive decrease in telomerase activity, with levels declining to approximately 10% of control levels by day 8 (Fig. 7A). In contrast to the case of undifferentiated PC12 cells (Fig. 2), when differentiated PC12 cells were exposed to apoptotic insults in the presence of the telomerase inhibitors TTAGGG or DODCB, levels of apoptosis were not different from levels in differentiated cells exposed to the insults in the absence of telomerase inhibitors (Fig. 7B). These data demonstrate a strong correlation between reduced telomerase activity and increased vulnerability to apoptosis, and when taken together with the data showing that telomerase inhibitors enhance apoptosis in undifferentiated PC12 cells, they suggest a role for telomerase in suppressing apoptosis. Several lines of evidence obtained in the present study suggest that telomerase activity plays a role in cellular resistance to apoptosis. First, inhibition of telomerase activity with TTAGGG and DODCB was associated with increased vulnerability of PC12 cells to apoptosis induced by three different insults (STS, Aβ, and Fe2+). These data are consistent with a very recent study showing that glioblastoma cell lines with high levels of telomerase activity exhibit reduced sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and that overexpression of telomerase antisense increases the vulnerability of the resistant cell lines (39Kondo Y. Kondo S. Tanaka Y. Haqqi T. Barna B.P. Cowell J.K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2243-2248Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Second, apoptotic insults caused a relatively rapid decrease in telomerase activity that preceded nuclear manifestations of apoptosis. A decrease in telomerase activity following exposure of human testicular cells to the DNA-damaging apoptotic agent cisplatin was recently documented by Burger et al. (40Burger A.M. Double J.A. Newell D.R. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 638-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Third, stable overexpression of Bcl-2 resulted in an increase in telomerase activity and resistance to apoptosis. The latter finding is consistent with a recent study showing that overexpression of Bcl-2 in human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells resulted in increased telomerase activity (41Mandel M. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14183-14187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Fourth, we found that telomerase activity was decreased upon differentiation of PC12 cells and that such differentiated cells exhibited increased sensitivity to apoptosis. Although further work will be required to establish the mechanism responsible for the resistance of cells with high levels of telomerase activity to apoptosis, the ability of sustained telomerase activity to prevent cellular senescence (10Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichtsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4147) Google Scholar) and of telomerase inhibitors to enhance apoptosis (present study) strongly suggest a central role for telomerase in modulation of cell death pathways. Previous studies have shown that the TTAGGG oligodeoxynucleotide is effective in inhibiting telomerase activity in several different types of cells in culture (29Morin G.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 30Zahler A.M. Williamson J.R. Chch T. Prescott D.M. Nature. 1991; 350: 718-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 31Mata J.E. Joshi S.S. Palen B. Pirruccello S.J. Jackson J.D. Elias N. Page T.J. Medlin K.L. Iversen P.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 144: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Presumably, the TTAGGG DNA occupies the activity of the telomerase enzyme complex and thereby prevents it from adding bases to the ends of chromosomes. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as azidothymidine and carbovir, can block telomerase activity and induce cell death in immortalized cell lines (42Strahl C. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and in normal fibroblasts (43Yegorov Y.E. Chernov D.N. Akimov S.S. Bolsheva N.L. Krayevsky A.A. Zelenin A.V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We found that both TTAGGG and DODCB, a compound previously shown to bind selectively to dimeric hairpin quadruplexes (24Chen W. Kuntz I.D. Shafer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2635-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), reduced telomerase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Concentrations of each agent that were effective in suppressing telomerase activity by more than 80% were not toxic to PC12 cells but markedly increased apoptosis following exposure to STS and oxidative insults. When combined with chemotherapeutic agents, such telomerase inhibitors may prove useful in promoting death of cancer cells. The established function of telomerase is to add the TTAGGG repeat to the ends of chromosomes (1Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic action of telomerase suggested by our data could conceivably be related to telomere elongation, if shortening of telomeres is an important event that triggers apoptosis. The ability of exogenous TTAGGG to enhance apoptosis is consistent with a role for the recognized DNA repeat elongating function in the anti-apoptotic action of telomerase. Because telomeres play a role in protecting DNA, it is possible that telomerase could prevent DNA-damaging events that trigger apoptosis. Indeed, DNA damage may be a critical event that triggers apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli (44Martin D.S. Stolfi R.L. Colofiore J.R. Cancer Invest. 1997; 15: 372-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For example, apoptosis induced by STS is associated with early DNA damage (45MacManus J.P. Rasquinha I. Walker T. Chakravarthy B. Hum. Cell. 1996; 9: 197-204PubMed Google Scholar), and DNA damage is a very early event in apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in human bladder tumor cells (46Higuchi Y. Matsukawa S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for DNA damage being an early and pivotal event in many apoptotic paradigms are data showing that Bcl-2 overexpression (47Weller M. Malipiero U. Aguzzi A. Reed J.C. Fontana A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2633-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 48Takeda M. Kobayashi M. Shirato I. Osaki T. Endou H. Arch.

Toxicol. 1997; 71: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 50Antoku K. Liu Z. Johnson D.E. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) can prevent apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents. Our data showing that Bcl-2 overexpression and caspase inhibitors protect PC12 cells against the pro-apoptotic actions of telomerase inhibitors in three different apoptotic paradigms are consistent with the latter studies and suggest that telomerase suppresses an early event in the apoptotic cascade. Our data suggest possible roles of telomerase in modulating apoptosis that occurs in both physiological settings and pathological states. Apoptosis occurs during the normal turnover of a variety of cell types throughout the body. The relatively low level of telomerase activity in many somatic cells that turn over (e.g. fibroblasts and various epithelial cells) may be important in allowing the cells to undergo apoptosis in response to appropriate environmental signals. Abnormal growth of such tissues may occur in association with dysregulated (increased) telomerase activity. In this regard, inhibition of telomerase is increasingly recognized as an important treatment strategy for many different kinds of cancer (51Sharma S. Raymond E. Soda H. Sun D. Hilsenbeck S.G. Sharma A. Izbicka E. Windle B. Von Hoff D.D. Ann. Oncol. 1997; 8: 1063-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The role of telomerase in apoptosis of postmitotic cells that undergo apoptosis should also be considered. We found that telomerase activity decreased when PC12 cells were differentiated into a neuron-like phenotype. Neurons and other postmitotic cells (e.g. cardiac myocytes) that have negligible telomerase activity are known to be extremely vulnerable to apoptosis induced by conditions such as ischemia or exposure to oxidative stress (52Linnik M.D. Zobrist R.H. Hatfield M.D. Stroke. 1993; 24: 2002-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 53Sabbah H.N. Sharov V.G. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1998; 40: 549-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It will be of considerable interest to determine whether expression of telomerase in such cells increases their resistance to apoptotic insults that are relevant to the pathogenesis of both acute (e.g. stroke and traumatic brain injury) and chronic (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases) neurodegenerative conditions (52Linnik M.D. Zobrist R.H.

This cDNA encodes 309 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 35.9 kDa. C-terminal kinase domain of AIK3 protein shares high amino acid sequence identities with those of Aurora/Ipl1 family protein kinases including human AIK, human AIK2, Xenopus pEg2,Drosophila Aurora, and yeast Ipl1, whereas the N-terminal domain of AIK3 protein shares little homology with any other Aurora/Ipl1 family members. AIK3 gene was assigned to human chromosome 19q13.43, which is a frequently deleted or rearranged region in several tumor tissues, by fluorescence in situhybridization, somatic cell hybrid panel, and radiation hybrid cell panel. Northern blot analyses revealed that AIK3 expression was limited to testis. The expression levels of AIK3 in several cancer cell lines were elevated severalfold compared with normal fibroblasts. In HeLa cells, the endogenous AIK3 protein level is low in G1/S, accumulates during G2/M, and reduces after mitosis. Immunofluorescence studies using a specific antibody have shown that AIK3 is localized to centrosome during mitosis from anaphase to cytokinesis.

Equal segregation of replicated chromosomes to daughter cells is an important event in the progression of cell cycle. The centrosomes are thought to play an important role(s) in bipolar spindle formation and maintenance at M phase. However, the molecular mechanisms of centrosome and mitotic spindle organization have not been studied well. In most cancer cells, an abnormality in chromosome number (aneuploidy) is observed (1Bunn P.A. Krasnow S. Makuch R.W. Schlam M.L. Schechter G.P.

Cell. 1995; 81: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) gene products are known to regulate chromosome segregation and constitute a family of serine/threonine kinases. Embryos derived from aurora mutant mothers inappropriately display closely paired centrosomes and monopolar spindles (11Glover D.M. Leibowitz M.H. McLean D.A. Parry H.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the functions of these proteins have not been studied well. Among the Aurora/Ipl1 kinase family, human AIK/BTAK, mouse IAK1/AYK1, and Xenopus pEg2 appear to constitute a subfamily, because these three protein kinases have closely related N-terminal domain as well as C-terminal kinase domain with each other. In HeLa cells, the endogenous levels of AIK mRNA and its protein contents are tightly regulated during cell cycle progression; they are low in G1/S, accumulate during G2/M, and reduce rapidly after mitosis. Its protein kinase activity is also enhanced at mitosis. Immunofluorescence studies using a specific antibody have shown that AIK/IAK1 protein is localized to the spindle pole during mitosis, especially from prophase through anaphase (13Kimura M. Kotani S.

Donovan P.J. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 86-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These two chromosomal regions share homology, supporting the notion that IAK1 is a mouse homolog of human AIK. This chromosomal region is amplified in several cancer tissues including breast and colorectal cancer (24Kallioniemi A. Kallioniemi O.P. Piper J. Tanner M. Stokke T. Chen L. Smith H.S. Pinkel D.

In a recent study, overexpression of wild type human AIK was shown capable of transforming rat fibroblasts, indicating that AIK is oncogenic (8Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S.M. Novotny M. Slamon D.J. Plowman G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3052-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). In addition, the overexpressed AIK protein induced centrosome amplification and aneuploidy (9Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Human AIK2, rat AIM-1, and mouse STK-1 have high amino acid sequence identities with each other along their full length, and these three proteins constitute the second subfamily of the Aurora/Ipl1 protein kinase family. The protein level of AIK2 elevated at G2/M phase (15Kimura M. Matsuda Y. Yoshioka T. Sumi N. Okano Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 82: 147-152Crossref Google Scholar). AIM-1 protein localizes at the equator of central spindles during late anaphase and at the midbody during telophase and cytokinesis (20Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a kinase-inactive AIM-1 disrupts cleavage furrow formation without affecting nuclear division. In these cells, cytokinesis frequently fails, resulting in multinucleation and subsequent cell death. Thus, AIM-1 was shown to be required for proper progression of cytokinesis in mammalian cells (20Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Suzuki F. Yasuda Y. Fujita S. Otsu M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Recently,STK-1 was mapped to mouse chromosome 11 and linked toTRP53 and GLUT4 (16Shindo M. Nakano H. Kuroyanagi H. Shirasawa T.

Jenkins N.A. Donovan P.J. Mamm. Genome. 1998; 9: 86-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). AIK2 gene was mapped to human chromosome 17p13.1 which is a homologous region to the STK-1 locus of the mouse chromosome (15Kimura M. Matsuda Y. Yoshioka T. Sumi N. Okano Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 82: 147-152Crossref Google Scholar). This chromosomal region is the most frequently deleted region in several cancer tissues (29McManus D.T. Murphy M. Arthur K. Hamilton P.W. Russell S.E. Toner P.G. J. Pathol. 1996; 179: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Sakamoto T. Nomura N. Mori H. Wake N. Gynecol.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6716-6721PubMed Google Scholar), but mutation or down-regulation ofAIK2 has not yet been identified. We have cloned a cDNA encoding a third human Aurora/Ipl1-related kinase, AIK3, which has a high homology with catalytic domain of Aurora/Ipl1-related kinase members. AIK3 gene is mapped at human chromosome 19q13.43, a region that was reported to be rearranged and deleted in several cancer cells. AIK3 is expressed highly in testis and several cancer cell lines. AIK3 protein level of M phase was higher than that of S phase cells. AIK3 is localized at centrosome from anaphase to cytokinesis in HeLa cells. To identify human cDNA sequences related to AIK or AIK2 cDNA, the GenBankTM data base was searched, and a cDNA encoding a novel kinase (AIK3) was identified (AA421265). This cDNA clone contains only the C-terminal region of kinase domain, and the full length of cDNA clones was obtained from testis cDNA library using PCR. 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; FCS, fetal calf serum Primers used were derived from nucleotide sequences of λgt11 (5′-TATGGGGATTGGTGGCGACGAC-3′ or 5′-ACTGGTAATGGTAGCGACCGGC-3′) and the 3′-untranslated region of AIK3 cDNA (5′-GGGAACAGAGGCAGAGGCAGACA-3′). PCR was carried out using the LA PCR kit (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) for 35 cycles at 94 (1 min), 60 (2 min), and 72 °C (2 min). The amplified products (1 kb) were subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and the nucleotide sequences of several clones were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. HeLa (cervical cancer), HBL100 (breast cancer), and WI38 (normal fibroblast) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), Raji (B-cell leukemia), and HL60 (leukemia) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. A neuroblastoma cell line NB69 and hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HuH7 were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% FCS and with 1% FCS plus 2% lactoalbumin, respectively. SK-N-SH (neuroblastoma) and NB1RGB (normal fibroblast) cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. MDA-MB-453 (breast cancer) was cultured in L15 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. For S phase synchronization, HeLa cells were synchronized by double thymidine treatment (32Stein G.S. Borun T.W. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 52: 292-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 2.5 mmthymidine for 20–24 h followed by a 10-h release in fresh medium and subsequent re-treatment with the drug for 16 h. For M phase synchronization, cells were synchronized by double thymidine treatment as above followed by 400 ng/ml nocodazole treatment for 12 h. Cells to be released from the drug treatment were washed with PBS twice and refed with fresh medium. At appropriate time points, the cells were harvested for Western blotting. The direct R-banding FISH method was used for chromosomal assignment of the human AIK3. Preparation of R-banded chromosomes and FISH was performed as described (33Takahashi E. Hori T. Lawrence J.B. McNeil J. Singer R.H. O'Connell P. Leppert M. White R. Jpn. J. Hum. Genet. 1989; 34: 307-311Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Takahashi E. Hori T. O'Connell P. Leppert M. White R. Hum.

Mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte culture was synchronized by thymidine block, and 5-bromodeoxyuridine was incorporated during the late replication stage for differential replication staining after the release from excessive thymidine. R-band staining was performed by exposure of chromosome slides to UV light after staining with Hoechst 33258. The chromosome slides were hardened at 65 °C for 3 h, denatured at 70 °C in 70% formamide in 2 × SSC, and then dehydrated in a 70–85-100% ethanol series at 4 °C. The 1.0-kb cDNA fragment of AIK3 inserted into pBluescript was labeled by nick translation with biotin 16-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's protocol. The labeled DNA fragment was ethanol-precipitated with salmon sperm DNA and Escherichia coli tRNA, and then denatured at 75 °C for 10 min in 100% formamide. The denatured probe was mixed with an equal volume of hybridization solution to make a final concentration of 50% formamide, 2 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma). A 20 μl mixture containing 250 ng of labeled DNA was put on the denatured slide, covered with parafilm, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The slides were washed for 20 min in 50% formamide in 2× SSC at 37 °C, and in 2× and 1× SSC for 20 min each at room temperature. After rinsing in 4× SSC, the slides were incubated under a coverslip with anti-biotin antibody (Vector Laboratories) at a 1:500 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin, 4× SSC for 1 h at 37 °C. They were washed with 4× SSC, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in 4× SSC, 4× SSC for 5 min each, and then stained with fluorescein anti-goat IgG (Nordic Immunology) at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with 4× SSC, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in 4× SSC, 4× SSC for 10 min on the shaker, the slides were rinsed with 2× SSC and stained with 0.75 μg/ml propidium iodide. Excitation at 450–490-nm wavelength (Nikon filter set B-2A) and near 365 nm (UV-2A) was used for observation. Kodak Ektachrome ASA100 film was used for microphotography. PCR was performed to assign AIK3 gene to human chromosome, using a DNA panel of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids (NIGMS Human/Rodent) purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ). A pair of oligonucleotide primers was constructed from the coding region (5′-AGAGAAGGAAGGACTGGAGCACC-3′ and 5′-ATCTGCAATCTTCACCTCACCCC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 237–259 and 530–552, respectively). PCR was carried out using the LA PCR kit (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) for 38 cycles at 94 (30 s), 65 (1 min), and 72 °C (1.5 min), and amplified products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel in TAE buffer. The G3 radiation hybrid cell panel was purchased from Research Genetics and used as a DNA template for PCR. The same primers and conditions were used for PCR as in the experiments with the somatic cell hybrid panel. Blotted filters with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane from various human tissues were purchased from CLONTECH. The blot was probed with32P-labeled random-primed full-length AIK3cDNA. Hybridization was performed as described (36Kimura M. Hirono M. Takemasa T. Watanabe Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The blots were washed at 55 °C for 1 h in a buffer containing 2× SSC and 0.5% SDS, and signals were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak BioMax film. Polyclonal antisera against AIK3 were generated against synthesized peptide (RYQPLERLPLAQILK) corresponding to the C-terminal region of AIK3 which has little homology with AIK and AIK2 amino acid sequences. The obtained immune sera were affinity purified with the peptide and used for Western blotting. For the control experiment, anti-AIK3 antibody was preincubated with glutathione S-transferase-AIK3 protein produced in E. coli and then used for Western blotting. Antibody against AIK was generated and purified as described (13Kimura M. Kotani S. Hattori T. Sumi N. Yoshioka T. Todokoro K. Okano Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13766-13771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Antibodies against cyclin B and ERK2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The synchronized cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested by scraping and then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium diphosphate, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40). Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Laemmli L.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore) by standard methods. Membranes were blocked for 2 h in TBST (0.1% Tween 20, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6) with 3% non-fat dry milk (blocking buffer). Probing with the specific antibodies was carried out for 1 h at room temperature in the blocking buffer containing 0.02% sodium azide. After washing 4 times in TBST, the membranes were probed with 200 ng/ml peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies for 1 h in TBST. After extensive washing in TBST, the membranes were processed for enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ECL exposures were carried out using Kodak BioMax film. For indirect immunofluorescence experiments, HeLa cells cultured on cover glasses were fixed by placing them directly into absolute methanol for 30 s. Extraction was done by incubating the cells with PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with the anti-AIK3 antibody for 1 h at 37 °C, washed extensively in PBS, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody conjugated with Oregon Green (Molecular Probe) for 1 h at 37 °C. DNA was visualized by adding 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Homology search of AIK2 cDNA with GenBankTM data base revealed the presence of a third Aurora/Ipl1-related kinase, AIK3. Since this clone did not contain initiation methionine, a full-length cDNA was obtained by PCR method with human testis cDNA library. The nucleotide sequences of several clones were determined and were identical with each other, and the nucleotide sequence was deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/ GenBankTM (accession number AB017332). This cDNA encodes 309 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 35.9 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence contains 11 conserved regions characteristic of protein kinase catalytic domain at C terminus of the protein (Fig. 1). Eleven conserved subdomains known in various protein kinases are indicated byroman numerals (Fig. 2). AIK3 has KPEN in subdomain VIB and does not have PXXWXAPE but only PE in subdomain VIII which are the consensus sequences of serine/threonine kinases, suggesting that AIK3 must be a serine/threonine kinase but not a tyrosine kinase.Figure 2Amino acid alignment of sequences of human AIK3, human AIK, human AIK2, Drosophila Aurora, and S. cerevisiae Ipl1.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4731-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), respectively. A multiple alignment of the kinase domains is shown in Fig. 2. Amino acids that are the same as AIK3 are indicated byasterisks. However, the N-terminal domain of AIK3 shares little homology with other Aurora/Ipl1-related kinases. These results indicate that AIK3 is a novel member of the Aurora/Ipl1-related protein kinase family. The chromosomal assignment of human AIK3 was made by direct R-banding fluorescencein situ hybridization (FISH) using a 1.0-kb AIK3cDNA fragment as a probe. The positive signals of AIK3gene were observed at chromosome 19q13.43 (Fig. 3). We examined 150 typical R-banded (pro)metaphase spreads. 6% of them exhibited complete twin spots on both homologues and 32% had incomplete signals and/or twin spots on either or both homologues. No consistent fluorescent signals were observed on other chromosomes. To confirm the chromosomal localization of AIK3 gene, we used the somatic cell hybrid panel (Coriell Cell Repositories). PCR amplification was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using oligonucleotides specific for AIK3cDNA. A band of 1.2 kb was amplified from DNAs containing human chromosome 19 and in human genomic DNA (H), but no product was seen in recipient Chinese hamster (CH) or mouse (M) DNAs (Fig. 4). To refine the chromosomal localization of AIK3, we used the Stanford G3 radiation hybrid mapping panel (Research Genetics). PCR amplification was performed under the same conditions as in the somatic cell hybrid panel. Bands (1.2 kb) of PCR product were detected inlanes 6, 20, 31, 39, 45, 54, 65, 77, and 85 and in human genomic DNA, but no product was seen in recipient Chinese hamster DNA (data not shown). Two-point maximum likelihood analysis, calculated by the Stanford Human Genome Center radiation hybrid web server, indicated linkage to a genetic marker D19S828 with a lod score of 8.645295. There was no evidence of linkage ofAIK3 to other genomic regions. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced both strands, and the product has the same nucleotide sequence as AIK3 over 100 bases and contains an intron(s) (data not shown). The results obtained byin situ hybridization and radiation hybrid panel were in accord, indicating that AIK3 is localized to human chromosome 19q13.43. Expression of AIK is high in testis, and AIK2 expression is observed in several proliferating tissues, suggesting that the two proteins have a function in cell proliferation. The tissue distribution of AIK3 was also examined by Northern hybridization. 32P-Labeled random-primed full-length AIK3 cDNA hybridized with a single transcript of 1.3 kb. AIK3 expression was limited to testis (Fig. 5). The expression of β-actin was examined using the same blot, and almost identical intensities of the bands were observed (38Kimura M. Hattori T. Matsuda Y. Yoshioka T. Sumi N. Umeda Y. Nakashima S. Okano Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 78: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results suggest that AIK3 may have a role(s) in cell proliferation. AIK is reported to be amplified and overexpressed in several cancer cell lines and tumor tissues (8Bischoff J.R. Anderson L.

To learn whether AIK3 is expressed in cancer cells, its protein level was examined in some cancer cell lines by Western blotting analyses. Elevated expression levels of AIK3 were observed in several of these cell lines such as HepG2, HuH7, MDA-MB-453, and HeLa cells, but in the other cancer cells examined the protein was not detected (Fig. 6).

Platelet MP modulate platelet, monocyte, and vascular endothelial cell function, both by direct effects of MP arachidonic acid (AA) and by its metabolism to bioactive prostanoids. We have previously reported that platelet MP induce expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and prostacyclin production in monocytes and endothelial cells. To elucidate further the molecular mechanisms that underlie MP-induced up-regulation of COX-2 expression, we investigated the response of a human monocytoid (U-937) cell line to platelet MP stimulation.In U-937 cells, MP-induced COX-2 expression and eicosanoid formation is prevented by pharmacological inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), PI 3-kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38 kinase. Treatment with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 also blocked MP-induced p42/p44 MAPK, p38, and JNK1 phosphorylation. Conversely, platelet MP stimulation of U-937 cells results in direct activation of PKC, p42/p44 MAPK, p38 kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) as well as activation of the transcription factors c-Jun and Elk-1. However, MP failed to activate the cAMP response element.Activation of U-937 cells by MP induces translocation of classical (PKCβ), novel (PKCδ) and atypical (PKCζ and PKCλ) isozymes of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane, with concomitant activation of downstream MAPK. While MP-induced activation of p42/p44 MAPK and p38 kinase is transient, a sustained activation of JNK1 was observed. Although PKC activation is required for MP-induced p42/p44 MAPK, activation of the stress kinases p38 and JNK1 was PKC-independent. The fatty acid fraction of the MP accounted for these effects, which were mimicked by MP AA. Rather than acting directly via nuclear receptors, MP AA activates COX-2-dependent prostaglandin production by a PKC/p42/p44 MAPK/p38 kinase-sensitive pathway in which PI 3-kinase plays a significant role. MP AA also stimulates transcriptional activation of COX-2 as well as c-Jun and Elk-1.

Increased circulating concentrations of MP have been detected in vivo in syndromes of platelet activation (8George J.N. Pickett E.B. Saucerman S. McEver R.P. Kunicki T.J. Kieffer N. Newman P.J. J.

It is likely that the shear forces in areas of disordered flow would favor MP formation (10Miyazaki Y. Nomura S. Miyake T. Kagawa H. Kitada C. Taniguchi H. Komiyama Y. Fujimura Y. Ikeda Y.

Biol. 1997; 17: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). MP might themselves evoke cellular responses in the immediate microenvironment of their formation. For instance, activation of endothelial cells results in MP shedding, which, in turn, activates neutrophils, enhancing their propensity to adhere to endothelium (12Bizios R. Lai L.C. Cooper J.A. Del Vecchio P.J. Malik A.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that arachidonic acid (AA) in platelet MP can influence platelet activation in a PKC-dependent manner and endothelial cell COX-2 expression via transcellular lipid metabolism (13Barry O.P. Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2118-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which MP induce such cellular responses are, however, unknown. The present studies were designed to delineate the signaling pathways involved in MP-induced COX-2 activation and prostaglandin formation. COX is the first rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of prostacyclin, prostaglandins, and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (14Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Two isozymes of COX have been described (15Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Meade E.A. Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6610-6614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both catalyze the cyclooxygenase-dependent transformation of prostaglandin G2 from AA and the subsequent peroxidation of prostaglandin G2 to prostaglandin H2 (17Ohki S. Ogino N. Yamamoto S. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 829-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While COX-1 is expressed constitutively in most tissues, COX-2 is usually induced as an immediate early gene by mitogenic or inflammatory stimuli as well as by ligands that act via G protein- and PKC-mediated pathways (18Herschman H.R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). More recent findings link the prostaglandin biosynthetic pathways with activation of MAPK signaling cascades (19Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 20Ridley S.H. Sarsfield S.J. Lee J.C. Bigg H.F. Cawston T.E. Taylor D.T. DeWitt D.L. Saklatvala J. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12901-12908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The MAPK pathway, of which there are three subgroups, is a conserved eukaryotic signaling cascade that is responsible for mediating the effects of extracellular stimuli on a wide variety of biological processes. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (also termed p42 MAPK and p44 MAPK) and the stress-activated protein kinases (also termed c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)) and p38 (22Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1110-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are distinguished by activating signals, substrate specificity, and cellular responses (23Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). While the extracellular signal-regulated kinases are predominantly activated by growth factors (24Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar), the JNKs and p38 MAPKs are activated by stress signals such as inflammatory cytokines, heat shock, ultraviolet light, and ischemia (26Kyriakis J.M.

It is thought that polyunsaturated fatty acids may influence gene regulation indirectly, via activation of membrane receptors coupled to downstream signaling cascades (27Long S.D. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1138-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or perhaps via nuclear receptors (28Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2721) Google Scholar, 29Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that unmetabolized AA in platelet MP modulates adhesive interactions between monocytes and endothelial cells (30Barry O.P. Praticò D. Savani R. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), a cellular interaction thought to be of relevance in the early stages of atherogenesis (31Issekutz T.B. Issekutz A.C. Movat H.Z. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 103: 47-55PubMed Google Scholar). Given that neither a membrane nor a nuclear receptor with high affinity for AA has been identified, we thought it of interest to delineate the molecular mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon. In the present study, we show that MP AA mimics the effect of MP in inducing COX-2 expression and prostaglandin formation in U-937 cells. MP AA activates PKC, p42/p44 MAPK, p38 kinase, JNK1, c-Jun, and Elk-1. Furthermore, inhibition of PKC, p42/p44 MAPK, p38 kinase, and PI 3-kinase prevents MP-mediated COX-2 expression and prostaglandin formation. These observations suggest that platelet MP AA may activate a membrane-linked signaling cascade that culminates in expression of COX-2 rather than requiring activation of nuclear receptors to regulate gene expression. Indomethacin,N,N-diisopropylethylamine, pentafluorylbenzyl bromide, EDTA, EGTA, cycloheximide, actinomycin-D, leupeptin, Nonidet P-40, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and aprotinin were purchased from Sigma. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), LY294002, and wortmannin were obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The prostacyclin analog, Iloprost, AA, [2H8]AA, TxB2, [2H4]TxB2, PGE2, and [2H4]PGE2 were all purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI).

Phosphoplus p42/p44 MAPK, and p38 MAPK antibody kits and the MEK-1 inhibitor 2-(2′-amino-3′-methoxyphenyl)-oxanaphthalen-4-one (PD98059) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against nonphosphorylated JNK and mouse monoclonal antibody against phosphorylated JNK were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The PathDetectTM in vivo signal transduction pathwaytrans-reporting system was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The luciferase assay kit and the pGL2-Basic vector were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Platelets were obtained from healthy volunteers as described previously (13Barry O.P. Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2118-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The volunteers had not taken any medication for at least 14 days. Briefly, blood was collected into a plastic syringe containing 3.8% buffered sodium citrate as anticoagulant (ratio 1:9). Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 130 × g for 15 min, and platelet-poor plasma by centrifugation of platelet-rich plasma at 900 × g. Washed platelets were isolated from platelet-rich plasma after centrifugation and resuspended in calcium- and magnesium-free Hepes buffer (pH 7.4). The platelet number was always adjusted to 3 × 108/ml. Platelet aggregation was studied at 37 °C using washed platelets in a PAP-4 model aggregometer (BIO-DATA Corp., Hatboro, PA) in siliconized cuvettes with continuous stirring. Platelet MP were isolated after platelet aggregation, as described previously (13Barry O.P. Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2118-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACScan; Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), and each preparation was assayed to exclude endotoxin contamination, using the Limulusamebocyte lysate assay. Final endotoxin contamination was always <0.02 unit/mg of protein. MP were also preincubated with polymixin B (50 μg/ml) for 1 h before their addition to U-937 cells to exclude bacterial contamination. U-937 cells, obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units of penicillin. They were washed twice with RPMI 1640, and 5 × 105 cells/well were plated into 12-well tissue culture plates. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion test. Indomethacin (20 μm) was always present in the medium for all experiments described. AA isolation was performed as described previously (13Barry O.P. Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2118-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were extracted according to a modified version of the method of Bligh and Dyer (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42694) Google Scholar) and separated as described in our previous publication (13Barry O.P. Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2118-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The free fatty acid fraction was purified by amino (NH2) column chromatography (International Sorbent Technology, Glamorgan, United Kingdom) followed by TLC. The band with the same Rf as standard AA was extracted from the TLC plate and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Identification of AA was confirmed by negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry, as described previously (13Barry O.P. Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2118-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that U-937 cells might metabolize the lipid substrate in the MP, MP were labeled with [2H8]AA. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 10 μm [2H8]AA for 3 h at 37 °C, and platelets were harvested after washing to remove unincorporated [2H8]AA. [2H8]AA-labeled MP were isolated and added to U-937 cells for 2, 6, 12, and 24 h to investigate a time-dependent increase in [2H7]PGE2 and [2H8]TxB2 formation. Supernatants were collected to determine [2H7]PGE2 and [2H8]TxB2 concentrations, which were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as described below. Western blot analysis of COX proteins was carried out as described previously (13Barry O.P. Praticò D. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2118-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Briefly, U-937 cells were stimulated with MP (6 μg/ml), the equivalent of 10 μm MP AA (3 μg/ml) and lysed following stimulation for 2, 6, 12, or 24 h. Equal amounts of protein (20 and 40 μg for COX-1 and COX-2, respectively) were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. After blocking the membranes for 2 h with 5% fat-free milk in Tris-buffered saline (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), they were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody directed against either COX-1 or COX-2 at a dilution of 1:10,000 for 1 h at room temperature. Both antibodies are specific for their respective enzymes, as described previously (33Habib A. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Maclouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23448-23454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Creminon C. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Pradelles P. Grassi J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature. Chemiluminescent substrates were used to reveal positive bands that were visualized after the exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GC/MS analysis studies were performed on a Fisons MD-800 GC/MS (VG Organic, Manchester, UK) equipped with a split/splitless injector operated in the splitless mode at 260 °C. The ions monitored were m/z 614 for TxB2, m/z 618 for [2H4]TxB2, m/z 622 for [2H8]TxB2, m/z 624 for PGE2, m/z 628 for [2H4]PGE2,m/z 631 for [2H7]PGE2, m/z 303 for AA, and m/z 311 for [2H8]AA. Expression and purification of recombinant PKC isozymes are described elsewhere (35Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). The specific enzymatic activities of the PKC isoforms used in this study have been previously described (35Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). PKC activity was measured using a mixture of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 μm ATP, [γ-32P]ATP (3 μCi/tube), 15 mm C4H6O4Mg, 10 μm α-pseudosubstrate peptide (RFARKGSLRQKNV) as the phosphoacceptor, the corresponding PKC isozyme, and increasing concentrations of AA. No PMA or phosphatidylserine (PS) was added. Assays were carried out at 30 °C for 5 min. Results are expressed and normalized as a percentage of the maximum stimulation observed for each PKC isoform. We selected 100 μg/ml PS alone as a PKC activator in the case of PKCζ and 100 μg/ml PS and 10 μm PMA for all other PKC isozymes (35Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). U-937 cells were treated with different concentrations of MP or MP AA. Cytosolic and particulate fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation as described by Szallasi et al. (36Szallasi Z. Smith C.B. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2118-21124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PKC was evaluated in both fractions by kinase activity or by Western blotting. Total PKC activity in each fraction was measured using the conditions described above but with the addition of PS (100 μg/ml) and PMA (10 μm) to the mixture for maximal stimulation. For Western blot analysis, samples of the cytosolic and particulate fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies for each PKC isozyme. Briefly, after incubation with MP or MP AA, U-937 cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min. The protein content was determined using a microbicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Equal amounts of protein for each fraction (20 μg) were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then blocked for 2 h with 5% fat-free milk in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with specific antibodies for PKCβ, -δ, -ζ, or -λ, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Transduction Laboratories). Membranes were then incubated with sheep anti-mouse IgG for PKCβ and PKCλ and sheep anti-rabbit IgG for PKCδ and PKCζ, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, at a 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were resolved using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometric analysis of the bands in the Western blot was performed with a Scanner Control, version 1.00 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). U-937 cells were cultured for 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing antibiotics and 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and then treated with MP (30 μg/ml) or MP AA (30 μm) for various times. After incubation, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 5 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was used for immunoblotting with specific antibodies for the phosphorylated or total p42/p44 MAPK, p38 or JNK1/2, using the experimental conditions described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Bands were resolved by chemiluminescence as described above. To investigate MP-induced COX-2 transcriptional activation, we employed a construct containing a 2.0-kilobase pair fragment of the promoter region of human COX-2,EcoRI (−1840) to MspA1I (+123) (5 base pairs upstream of ATG), which was cloned into the HindIII site upstream of the Photinus pyralis (firefly) luciferase gene in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega) after linker ligation. This COX-2 construct has been previously described in more detail (37Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. White R.L. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4816-4820Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). We employed two methods to investigate MP-induced CRE activation. First, we generated a truncated form of the COX-2 promoter from −87 to +123 by polymerase chain reaction. This fragment contains the previously identified CRE site (TTCGTCA) (38Tazawa R. Xu X.-M. Wu K.K. Wang L.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 203: 190-199Google Scholar). We subcloned it into the HindIII site and the BglII site of the pGL2-Basic vector. Second, we employed the PathDetect cis-reporting system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which includes a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene driven by a basic promoter element (TATA box) plus tandem repeats of the CRE. The pFC-PKA plasmid driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter and containing the PKA catalytic subunit was used as a positive control to monitor the activity of CRE. We also employed the PathDetect trans-reporting system to investigate MP-induced transcription factor activation. This includes a pathway-specific fusion trans-activator plasmid, which is an in-frame fusion of an activation domain and the DNA binding domain of the yeast trans-activator GAL4. A GAL4-c-Jun-(1–223) plasmid controlled by an SV40 promoter or a GAL4-c-Elk-1-(307–427) plasmid controlled by an MLV promoter fusion protein were employed for these experiments. MEKK-(380–672) and MEK1 (S218/222E,Δ32–51) plasmids were used as positive controls to monitor the activity of c-Jun and Elk-1 respectively. The pFR-Luc reporter plasmid contains a synthetic promoter with five tandem repeats of the yeast GAL4 upstream activating sequences that control expression of the firefly luciferase gene. All experiments involving the COX-2 promoter or a truncated form of the promoter, employed the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega), which lacks the COX-2 promoter, as a negative control. The pFC-dbd plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which lacks the activation domain of either c-Jun, Elk-1, or CRE but contains a GAL4-dbd-(1–147) domain and is controlled by an SV40 promoter, was used as a negative control for the trans- and cis-reporting systems, respectively. Forskolin (10 μm) was used as a positive stimulus to monitor the activation of both the COX-2/CRE sequence and the CREcis-reporting system. U-937 cells (6 × 106) were cultured for 24 h in RPMI 1640 containing antibiotics and 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, following transfection with the COX-2 promoter to avoid serum induction of COX-2. Cells were also transfected with the truncated form of the COX-2 promoter containing the CRE sequence or with the pGL2-Basic vector as a negative control. Transfections were performed using SuperFECTTM (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Similarly, cells were cotransfected with luciferase reporter plasmids along with various amounts of c-Jun or Elk-1 expression plasmids or the pFC-dbd plasmid as a negative control. Cells were also transfected with the CRE expression plasmid alone or the pFC-dbd plasmid. Cells were then treated with either MP (30 μg/ml), MP AA (30 μm), or forskolin (10 μm) for the indicated time periods. Following stimulation, cells were collected, washed with PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer (Promega). The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 2 min, and the supernatant was then assayed for luciferase activity, using a commercial assay kit (Promega). Luminescence was recorded at 560 nm using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The protein concentration was determined (Pierce) and used for normalization of the luciferase assays. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made by using analysis of variance with subsequent application of Student's t test, as appropriate. Treatment of U-937 cells with MP induced the expression of COX-2, which was maximal at 12 h (Fig. 1A). No changes in the expression of COX-1 were observed after MP treatment (Fig. 1E). Expression of COX-2 protein coincided with an increase in PGE2 and TxB2 synthesis, as measured in the supernatant (Table I). This increase was dose-dependent (data not shown). The EC50values were 3 and 6 μg/ml of MP protein for PGE2 and TxB2, respectively. Indomethacin (20 μm), which is a preferential inhibitor of COX-1, which is expressed constitutively in U-937 cells, was always present in the medium (39Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T.

https://openalex.org/W2151364245,"Prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme (PPAE) was purified to homogeneity as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from larval cuticles of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The purified PPAE preparation was shown to be a mixture of the isozymes of PPAE (PPAE-I and PPAE-II), which were eluted at different retention times in reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. PPAE-I and PPAE-II seemed to be post translationally modified isozymes and/or allelic variants. Both PPAE isozymes were proteins composed of two polypeptides (heavy and light chains) that are linked by disulfide linkage(s) and glycosylated serine proteases. The results of cDNA cloning, peptide mapping, and amino acid sequencing of PPAE revealed that PPAE is synthesized as prepro-PPAE with 441 amino acid residues and is activated from pro-PPAE by cleavage of a peptide bond between Lys152 and Ile153. The homology search showed 36.9% identity of PPAE to easter, which is a serine protease involved in dorso-ventral pattern formation in the Drosophila embryo, and indicated the presence of two consecutive clip-like domains in the light chain. A single copy of the PPAE gene was suggested to be present in the silkworm genome. In the fifth instar larvae, PPAE transcripts were detected in the integument, hemocytes, and salivary glands but not in the fat body or mid gut. A polypeptide cross-reactive to mono-specific anti-PPAE/IgG was transiently detected in the extract of eggs between 1 and 3 h after they were laid.

Chapman & Hall, London1998: 135-172Google Scholar). Unlike the well established interrelationships among defense mechanisms and other mechanisms maintaining homeostasis in higher vertebrates, there is a paucity of information concerning such interrelationships in insects.One of the immune mechanisms in insects is the pro-PO cascade, a serine proteinase cascade involved in the generation of superoxide, melanin synthesis, and subsequent sequestration of foreign matter entering the hemocoel of the insect (3Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 135-172Google Scholar, 4Nappi A.J. Vass E.

A., Cox-Foster, D., Third International Symposium on Molecular Insect Science, Snowbird Utah, June 5–10, 1998, Abstract 33, 1998, The Center of Insect Science, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.Google Scholar). The cascade is composed of recognition proteins that specifically bind microbial cell wall components such as peptidoglycan or β-1,3-glucan, serine protease zymogens, and pro-PO (6Yoshida H. Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 539-545Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). It is present in the hemolymph (9Ashida M. Yamazaki H.I. Ohnishi E. Ishizaki I. Molting and Metamorphosis. Japan Science Society Press/Springer-Verlag, Tokyo1990: 239-265Google Scholar) and in the cuticle of the body wall (10Ashida M. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10698-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and is triggered by injury or minute amounts of peptidoglycan and β-1,3-glucan (3Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 135-172Google Scholar). Activation of the cascade results in limited proteolysis of pro-PO to the active phenoloxidase (PO). The active enzyme catalyzes two kinds of reactions: the oxygenation of monophenols to o-diphenols and oxidation ofo-diphenols to the corresponding quinones necessary for melanin synthesis (11Mason H.S. Annu. Bev. Biochem. 1965; 34: 595-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). During melanin synthesis, the various quinones formed are cytotoxic to invading microorganisms and also facilitate the formation of covalently linked coagulum around microorganisms invading the insect and at the injured part (4Nappi A.J. Vass E. Pigment Cell Res. 1993; 6: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). As the insect pro-PO has been shown to be a protein homologous to the arthropod hemocyanins, we have previously speculated that the pro-PO may be involved in physiological processes other than defense mechanisms, such as O2transport (10Ashida M. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10698-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).Another serine proteinase cascade in insects is involved in the establishment of the dorso-ventral pattern in the Drosophilaembryo (12Morisato D. Annu. Rev. Genetics. 1995; 29: 371-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Very recently, Lemaitre et al. (13Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.-M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar) have provided evidence demonstrating the links between the dorso-ventral pattern formation and immune protein induction. They reported the involvement of components of the dorso-ventral pattern formation pathway, named spätzle and Toll, in the induction of an antifungal peptide (drosomycin) synthesis in the fruit fly,Drosophila melanogaster, following fungal infection. At the blastoderm stage of the Drosophila embryo, spätzle is a ligand of the cell surface receptor, Toll, and is produced from pro-spätzle following a limited proteolysis by the serine protease easter in the perivitelline space. The binding of spätzle to Toll causes activation of the intracellular signaling pathway for the dorso-ventral pattern formation. These previously reported observations raise the possibility that easter is involved in the extracellular signaling pathways for drosomycin synthesis and the dorso-ventral pattern formation in Drosophila. The parallels between intracellular signaling pathways for the dorso-ventral pattern formation of the Drosophila embryo and activation of the Drosophila immune protein gene have been known for several years (14Hultmark D. Nature. 1994; 367: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the links between the dorso-ventral pattern formation and immune protein induction seem to be much closer than they had previously been thought to be.Before the implication of the Toll pathway, the pro-PO cascade was the only protease cascade known to be present in larval and adult stages of insects. At present, two serine proteases of the insect pro-PO cascade have been purified. One of them, which is tentatively referred to as BAEEase, was purified from the silkworm hemolymph and has been shown to be activated from its zymogen (pro-BAEEase) by limited proteolysis (15Katsumi Y. Kihara H. Ochiai M. Ashida M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The function of pro-BAEEase remains unknown. The other enzyme, pro-PO-activating enzyme (PPAE), was purified by Dohke 26 years ago (16Dohke K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 157: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) from larval cuticles of silkworms. We previously reported that PPAE is also present as an inactive zymogen (pro-PPAE) in the hemolymph and cuticles of silkworm larvae (6Yoshida H. Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 539-545Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Ashida M. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10698-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Since the first purification by Dohke, PPAE has been purified from several insect species (17Andersson K. Sun S.-C. Boman H.G. Steiner H. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 629-637Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Chen C. Durrant H.J. Newton R.P. Ratcliffe N.A. Biochem.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, characterization of PPAE at the molecular level and elucidation of the activation mechanism of PPAE zymogen remain to be carried out.Here, we report the purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of PPAE. PPAE is shown to be a homologous protein to easter and to be synthesized in the epidermis of the integument, the hemocytes, and the salivary glands in the larval stage of the silkworm,Bombyx mori. Preliminary immunochemical study suggests the presence of pro-PPAE in silkworm eggs.RESULTSPurification of PPAEDohke (16Dohke K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 157: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) extracted PPAE from the cuticles of silkworms with deionized water and reported purification of the enzyme. We obtained the ammonium sulfate fraction of PPAE (PPAE-dw) by adopting his procedures for the extraction and ammonium sulfate fractionation. We re-extracted the residue of the water extraction with buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and subjected the extract to ammonium sulfate fractionation between 0.2 and 0.4 saturation to obtain a PPAE fraction (PPAE-salt). We found that PPAE-salt contained much more (16.5 times more) PPAE than PPAE-dw and that the specific activity of PPAE-salt was 19 times higher than that of PPAE-dw. PPAE in PPAE-salt was purified by column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxyapatite, and CM-cellulose according to the method of Dohke. In the chromatography, PPAE appeared to be eluted at the essentially same salt and buffer concentrations as those reported by Dohke (data not shown). PPAE in the CM fraction obtained after CM-cellulose column chromatography was further purified by column chromatography on Sepharose-mABA and hydroxyapatite as is described under “Experimental Procedures.” The column chromatography on Sepharose-mABA was very effective for removing contaminated proteins (Table II). In the second column chromatography on hydroxyapatite, elution profiles of protein and PPAE activity were symmetrical and superimposable (Fig. 1), indicating that the purity of PPAE eluted from the column was high. About 20 mg of homogeneous PPAE was obtained, and the preparation was named the second HA fraction (TableII).Table IISummary of purification of PPAE from silkworm cuticlesFractionTotal volumeTotal activityActivityTotal proteinProteinSpecific activityYieldmlunitsunits/mlmgmg/mlunits/mg protein%AS1,1452,999,9002,62011,67910.3256.9100DEAE1,7201,754,4001,020737.90.4292,377.658.5First HA1301,040,0008,000192.41.4805,40533.7CM118736,0006,24096.760.827,60924.5Sepharose-mABA276843,528bThe reason for the increase in total activity and yield was not investigated.3,05622.560.08237,39028.1bThe reason for the increase in total activity and yield was not investigated.Second HAaPPAE of this fraction hydrolyzed BAEE and Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-Mec under standard assay conditions at the rates of 66.2 μmol/min/mg protein and 1.17 μmol/60 min/mg protein, respectively.48771,84016,08020.40.42536,61125.7a PPAE of this fraction hydrolyzed BAEE and Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-Mec under standard assay conditions at the rates of 66.2 μmol/min/mg protein and 1.17 μmol/60 min/mg protein, respectively.b The reason for the increase in total activity and yield was not investigated. Open table in a new tab Reversed-phase C8 Column Chromatography of PPAEPurified PPAE in the second HA fraction was eluted in two peaks in reversed-phase C8 column chromatography (Fig. 2). Proteins with a shorter retention time and with a longer retention time were named PPAE-I and PPAE-II, respectively. PPAE-I and PPAE-II could be separated in reversed-phase chromatography on columns such as a C8 column and ODS column but not by any other fractionation methods examined so far, including polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 9.2 and 6.5 under nondenaturing conditions, iso-electric polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown), and ConA-Sepharose column chromatography. 2D. Satoh and M. Ashida, unpublished observations. Molecular Mass of PPAEThe molecular mass of PPAE under nondenatured conditions was determined to be 45,000 Da in gel permeation chromatography on a Sephacryl S 200 column (data not shown). PPAE (second HA fraction and a mixture of PPAE-I and PPAE-II) migrated to the position corresponding to that of 45,000-Da protein in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Under reducing conditions, PPAE gave two bands (light chain and heavy chain) in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3a). The light chain and heavy chain of PPAE were determined to be 22.0 kDa and 38.5 kDa, respectively, from their mobilities. In a separate experiment, both PPAE-I and PPAE-II were shown to give the same electrophoretic pattern, as is seen in Fig. 3a. These results indicate that both PPAE-I and PPAE-II are composed from light and heavy chains. In the present report, we refer to the light chain and the heavy chain of PPAE-I as PPAE-I-L and PPAE-I-H, respectively, and those of PPAE-II as PPAE-II-L and PPAE-II-H. In MALDI mass spectrometry, mass numbers of PPAE-I and PPAE-II were determined to be 48,811 and 48,821, respectively (Fig. 4). After S-pyridylethylation, the mass numbers of PPAE-I-L, PPAE-II-L, PPAE-I-H, and PPAE-II-H were determined to be 18,122, 18284, 32848, and 32834, respectively. All of the mass numbers observed were bigger than those expected from the deduced amino acid sequences. The calculated mass numbers for the S-pyridylethylated light chains (PPAE-I-L and PPAE-II-L) and the S-pyridylethylated heavy chains (PPAE-I-H and PPAE-II-H) were 17,865.6 and 30,294.1, respectively.Figure 3SDS-PAGE and fluorography of PPAE. a, PPAE (second HA fraction) was run in SDS-PAGE under reduced and nonreduced conditions. Proteins were stained with CBB. About 1.2 μg of PPAE was applied to each lane. Lane 1, nonreduced PPAE; lane 2, reduced PPAE; lane M, marker proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) lined from topto bottom in the following order (numbers inparentheses show molecular mass): phosphorylase a(92.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), and lysozyme (14.4 kDa). b, [3H]DFP-labeled PPAE-I and PPAE-II were run in SDS-PAGE, and labeled polypeptides were detected by fluorography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples applied to each lane: lane 3, nonreduced PPAE-I (14 μg); lane 4, nonreduced PPAE-II (6 μg); lane 5, reduced PPAE-I (14 μg); lane 6, reduced PPAE-II (6 μg); 14C-M, 14C-labeled (carboxymethylated) colored marker proteins lined from topto bottom in the following order (numbers in parentheses show molecular mass): myosin (200 kDa), phosphorylase b(97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (69 kDa), ovalbumin (46 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), and lysozyme (14.3 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4MALDI mass spectrometry of PPAE-I (a) and PPAE-II (b). Typical spectra for PPAE-I and PPAE-II are presented. Ten spectra were examined for each of PPAE-I and PPAE-II, and the mean values of the observed Mass/H+ for both PPAEs were calculated to be 48,811 for PPAE-I and 48,821 for PPAE-II. In SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, the PPAE-I and PPAE-II used in the present mass spectrometry gave very faint bands under the 45-kDa PPAE band. Substances giving mass numbers between MH+ and MH2+ seemed to be proteins stained faintly in the SDS-PAGE. We have observed self-digestion of purified PPAE on the storage. Details of the mass spectrometry are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Iso-electric Point of PPAEThe iso-electric point of PPAE seemed to be higher than 10, because PPAE could not stay in the gel where a pH gradient from 4 to 10 had been established during electrofocusing. Furthermore, PPAE could not enter into the separating gel of pH 9.2 in PAGE under nondenaturing conditions. The isoelectric point of PPAE predicted from its deduced amino acid sequence was 7.82 (35Skoog B. Wichman A. Trends Anal. Chem. 1986; 5: 82-83Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The reason for such a large discrepancy between the observed and the predicted isoelectric points is not known.Fluorography of [3H]DFP-labeled PPAE-I and PPAE-IIPPAE was treated with [3H]DFP before the separation of PPAE-I and PPAE-II by reversed-phase ODS column chromatography. The results in Fig. 3b indicate that PPAE-I-H and PPAE-II-H were labeled with [3H]DFP but PPAE-I-L and PPAE-II-L were not. Thus, both PPAE-I-H and PPAE-II-H were indicated to be catalytic polypeptides of serine proteases.Detection of Carbohydrates of PPAE-I and PPAE-II by SDS-PAGE and Lectin BlottingNone of the lectins used in the present study bound to PPAE-I-L and PPAE-II-L under the experimental conditions (Fig. 5). PPAE-I-H and PPAE-II-H were blotted by concanavalin A, lentil seed agglutinin A, and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin but not by Arachis hyogaeaagglutinin, wheat germ agglutinin, Phaeaseolus agglutinin E4, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1.Figure 5SDS-PAGE and lectin blotting of PPAE-I and PPAE-II. PPAE-I and PPAE-II (5 μg protein/each lane) were run on SDS-PAGE with the same marker proteins as in Fig. 3a under reducing conditions. After the transfer of the proteins to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane, the remaining gel was stained for proteins with CBB and are shown under the letters CBB. PPAE-I and PPAE-II were loaded to the lanes marked with Iand II, respectively. PPAE-I and PPAE-II on the membrane were blotted with peroxidase-conjugated lectins and visualized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The names of lectins used are indicated at the top: ConA, concanavalin A; LCA, lentil seed agglutinin A; PNA, A. hyogaea agglutinin; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin;PHA-E 4, Phaeaseolus vulgalis agglutinin E4; DBA, D. biflorus agglutinin;UAE-I, U. europaeus agglutinin 1. From the relative mobilities of blots and stained proteins in the gel, proteins reactive to some of lectins were confirmed to be PPAE-I-H and PPAE-II-H. Positions of molecular mass markers are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)N-terminal Amino Acid Sequences of PPAE-I and PPAE-IIPPAE-I and PPAE-II were reduced and pyridylethylated. The light chain and heavy chain of each of S-pyridylethylated PPAE-I and PPAE-II were separated by reversed-phase chromatography on a C8 column. The S-pyridylethylated PPAE-I-H and PPAE-II-H were analyzed for N-terminal amino acid sequences. The results showed that both of the polypeptides have the same amino acid sequences up to 16th residue from the N termini. They were NH2-IVGGAPASIDSYPWLV.Neither PPAE-I-L nor PPAE-II-L gave N-terminal amino acid after Edman degradation. However, both of the S-pyridylethylated light chains gave the same N-terminal sequences after deblocking with pyroglutamate aminopeptidase. We analyzed the sequences of the deblocked PPAE-I-L and PPAE-II-L up to the 10th residue. Their N-terminal sequences appeared to be pyroglutamyl-SCRTPNGLNG.Some Enzymatic Properties of PPAEBecause we could not separate PPAE-I and PPAE-II by any means other than reversed-phase chromatography, which caused inactivation of enzymes, we used a mixture of the isoforms to examine the enzymatic properties.ThermostabilityPPAE was stable at 25 °C, but above that temperature, inactivation occurred. At 50 °C, PPAE lost its activity completely in 5 min (Fig. 6a). pH stability at 0 °C for 24 h: PPAE was shown to be stable in a pH range of 6.0 to 8.5. Below pH 6.0, inactivation occurred, and PPAE lost its activity completely during incubation at pH 3.5. In alkaline pH, PPAE was relatively stable, and 80% of the activity remained even at pH 10.5 (Fig. 6b).Figure 6Stability of PPAE. PPAE activity was assayed by using BAEE. a, thermostability. PPAE solution (1.647 mg protein/ml of 0.01 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, containing 0.1 m KCl) was incubated for 5 min at various temperatures, as indicated in the figure. After incubation, the remaining PPAE activity was assayed. Activity after incubation on ice is taken as 100%. b, pH stability. PPAE was incubated at various pHs for 24 h on ice, and the activity was assayed. Activity that recovered after incubation at pH 6.75 in phosphate buffer was taken as 100%. Buffers used were: ▿, glycine-HCl buffer; ■, acetate buffer; ●, citrate buffer; ▵, potassium phosphate buffer; ○, Tris-HCl buffer; ▪, carbonate buffer. Details are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of the Concentration of Salt on Esterase ActivityThe esterase activity of PPAE is greatly affected by the salt concentration. The ability of PPAE to hydrolyze BAEE at 4 mm KCl was less than 10% of that at 500 mm KCl (Fig. 7a). KCl was shown to have an effect on K m and Vmaxof PPAE when its activity was assayed by using BAEE as a substrate. At low concentrations (4–40 mm) of KCl, K mfor BAEE was about 1 mm, and at high concentrations,K m decreased to 0.35 mm at 250 mm KCl. The value of Vmax obtained at 250 mm KCl was about 4.5 times higher than that obtained at 4 mm KCl (Fig. 7b).Figure 7Effect of KCl on esterase activity of PPAE. a, effect of KCl on esterase activity of PPAE at fixed BAEE concentration. The concentration and pH of Tris-HCl buffer of the standard reaction mixture for assay of esterase activity of PPAE were modified to 1 mm and 8.5–8.6, respectively, in the present experiments. PPAE activity was assayed at varied KCl concentrations in the modified reaction mixture. PPAE was dialyzed against 1 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, before use. Activity is presented as a percentage of the activity at 1 m KCl.b, effect of KCl concentration on K m and Vmax of PPAE. PPAE activity was assayed as ina. Velocities of the hydrolysis of BAEE at various concentrations of BAEE and KCl were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are plotted according to the method of Lineweaver and Burk (61Koshland D.E.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 1. Academic Press, New York1970: 348-355Google Scholar). In the graph, abscissaand ordinate are graduated in BAEE mM−1 and μmol hydrolyzed/min/mg protein−1, respectively.Vmax and K m at 500 mm KCl and 4 mm KCl are read from the figure to be 89.4 μmol BAEE hydrolyzed/min/mg PPAE, 19.9 μmol BAEE hydrolyzed/min/mg PPAE, 0.35 and 1.2 mm, respectively. Concentrations of KCl were: ○, 500 mm; ▴, 250 mm; ▪, 80 mm; ×, 40 mm; ■, 8 mm; ▾, 4 mm. In a and b, 0.989 μg of PPAE was used for each assay of activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Substrate SpecificitySubstrate specificity of PPAE was examined by using various fluorogenic substrates, NH-Mecs (TableIII). NH-Mecs were required to have Arg at the P1 site to be hydrolyzed efficiently by PPAE. However, Arg at the P1 site was not sufficient for the substrates to be hydrolyzed. The amino acids at P2 and P3 sites also affected the ability of the substrates to be hydrolyzed. Substrate specificity of BAEEase (15Katsumi Y. Kihara H. Ochiai M. Ashida M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which has been shown to be activated in the silkworm plasma from pro-BAEEase by microbial cell wall components, was different from that of PPAE.Table IIISubstrate specificity of PPAESubstrateaSubstrates other than those indicated here were examined. However, none of them were hydrolyzed appreciably by PPAE under the present experimental conditions.

The multistep process of tumorigenesis involves the accumulation of genetic defects contributing to the tumor phenotype. In addition to a critical role in the orchestration of orderly cell cycle progression, components of the G1 phase regulatory apparatus play an important role in tumorigenesis.

Cyclin D1 abundance is induced transcriptionally, whereas the protein is degraded rapidly upon the withdrawal of growth factors via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (12Diehl J.A. Zindy F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 957-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The human breast cancer cell line MCF7 has been used to examine the regulation of cyclin D1, demonstrating the induction of cyclin D1 protein levels in these cells by estrogens, serum, and epidermal growth factor (6Lukas J.

Recent studies suggest that cyclin D1 plays an important role in Ras-induced NIH3T3 cell transformation (21Liu J.-J. Chao J.-R. Jiang M.-C. Ng S.-Y. Yen J.J.-Y. Yang-Yen H.-F. Mol. Cell.

Tennant R.W. Weinbergh R.A. Yuspa S.H. Conti C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2469-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).In contrast, relatively little is known of the molecular mechanisms by which activating Src mutations directly affect components of the cell cycle regulatory apparatus (23Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). The pp60c-src proto-oncogene encodes a 60-kDa cytoplasmic nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (24Johnson D. Frame M.C. Wyke J.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2017-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that is sufficient to both initiate and maintain cellular transformation (25Collett M.S. Purchio A.F. Erikson R.L. Nature. 1980; 285: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In previous studies, performed in fibroblast cell lines, overexpression of pp60v-src enhanced the rate of G1 phase progression in association with an induction of cyclin D1 protein levels in NIH3T3 cells, implicating cyclin D1 in pp60v-src action (21Liu J.-J.

In Rat-1 cells, however, pp60v-src overexpression did not induce cyclin D1 expression, and a reduction in p27Kip1 levels was observed, suggesting that p27Kip1 transcriptional repression may play a role in pp60v-src signaling (26Hanafusa H. Comp. Virol. 1977; 10: 401-483Crossref Google Scholar). Activation of the pp60c-src tyrosine kinase has been observed in a large proportion of human breast malignancies (27Ottenhoff-Kalff A.E. Rijksen G. van Beurden E.A. Hennipman A. Michels A.A. Staal G.E. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4773-4778PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of pp60c-src under control of the murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeat in transgenic mice induced mammary gland tumor formation (28Webster M.A. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The cell cycle regulatory targets of pp60src in mammary epithelial cells are virtually unknown, and the intracellular kinase pathways by which pp60src regulates cell cycle regulatory pathways also remain to be determined.In fibroblasts and fibroblast-derived cell lines, pp60v-src induces several downstream signaling pathways including members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, the p42 and p44 extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) (29VanRenterghem B.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7937-7943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the signal transducers and activators of transcription (33Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell J.E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) play a role in signaling induced by pp60v-src. The role of MAPKs in pp60v-src signaling requires reinvestigation as some ten MAPK family members have now been identified in mammalian cells, increasing the potential complexity and allowing for specificity in signaling (34Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 35Karin M. J. Biol.

Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Two of these MAPKs, (MAPK1/ERK1 and MAPK2/ERK2) are strongly activated by polypeptides and growth factors but are poorly induced by stress stimuli. In contrast, the other MAPK family members are strongly activated by stress signals and are frequently referred to as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs). Chemical inhibitors of specific MAPKs have aided in identification of downstream signaling pathways. The drug PD98059 suppresses the activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway by preventing activation of the upstream activator MAPK kinase 1 (MKK1 or MEK1). Recent studies have identified distinct members of the SAPK family, with MAP kinase kinase 4 (MKK4, also known as SEK1) and MAP kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) activating JNK, whereas MAP kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) and MAP kinase kinase 6 (MKK6) activate members of the p38 MAPK group (34Cohen P.

The drug SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38α and p38β MAPK, prevents the activation of MAP kinase-activated protein-K2 and MAP kinase-activated protein-K3 (37Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R.

These studies suggest that cell type-specific factors mediate the MAPK pathways activating CREB transactivation and raise the possibility that CREB may be a target of pp60v-src signaling.Because relatively little is known of the molecular mechanisms by which pp60src engages components of the cell cycle regulatory apparatus in breast cells, we have examined the regulation of cyclin D1 by pp60v-src in MCF7 cells and determined the expression and activity of cyclin D1 in mammary tumors induced by mammary-targeted overexpression of an activating pp60c-src mutant in transgenic mice. In these studies, optimal pp60v-src induction of cyclin D1 required collaboration between the MAPK/ERK, p38, and JNK pathways. We provide evidence that CREB and ATF-2 bind a common DNA element and serve as distal transcriptional targets of pp60v-src induction of the cyclin D1gene in MCF7 cells. The induction of CREB by pp60v-src required a p38 pathway, and induction of ATF-2 by pp60v-src required the JNK pathway. pp60v-src activation of distinct transcription factors that bind common DNA sequences of the cyclin D1 promoter occurs through specific MAPK modules.DISCUSSIONIn these studies, we demonstrate that cyclin D1 is induced by pp60src in mammary tumor cells and identify the intracellular signaling pathway responsible for induction of the cyclin D1gene by pp60v-src. Induction of the cyclin D1 gene by pp60v-src required the MEK1/ERK, MKK3/p38, and JNK pathways in mammary epithelial cells. Consistent with our previous results in which ERK induced cyclin D1 promoter activity and dominant negative mutants of ERK reduced growth factor-regulated promoter activity (16Albanese C. Johnson J.

The ERKs functioned downstream of pp60c-src signaling to the vascular endothelial growth factor gene (72Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In contrast with previous studies in which p38 was an inhibitor of cyclin D1 in CCL39 fibroblasts (69Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Muller R. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar), we observed that the p38 inhibitor SB203580 reduced pp60v-src induction of cyclin D1 by 38%. In addition, the use of the JIP-1 expression plasmid, which selectively retains Jun kinase in the cytoplasm thereby inhibiting Jun kinase signaling, allowed us to identify an important role for Jun kinase in pp60v-src signaling to cyclin D1. These results are consistent with a previous study in which pp60v-srcinduced JNK/SAPK activity using glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun as substrate (31Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The finding that cyclin D1 is induced by pp60v-src through a JNK signaling pathway is consistent with previous correlative analysis in which activating Rac mutants, which induce JNK activity, also induced the cyclin D1 promoter in a p21-activated kinase-dependent manner (18Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and that Dbl family members, which induce transformation and JNK activity, also induced cyclin D1 expression (20Westwick J.K. Lee R.J. Lambert Q.T. Symons M. Pestell R.G. Kay R. Der C.J. Whitehead I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16739-16747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The current studies are the first to directly demonstrate the requirement for JNK in oncogene signaling to cyclin D1.The cyclin D1 promoter CRE/ATF site was required for optimal induction by pp60v-src. Additional pp60v-src-responsive sequences were also present within the region between −141 and −66; however, the minimal sequences required for induction remained within the −66 bp fragment. Mutation of the CRE/ATF site in the context of the native promoter significantly reduced induction by pp60v-src and the CRE/ATF sequence was induced 16-fold by pp60v-src when linked to a heterologous promoter, consistent with an important role for this sequence in pp60v-src signaling to the cyclin D1gene. These studies identified the ATF-2 and CREB transcription factors as the primary proteins binding these DNA sequences in MCF7 cells, and overexpression of pp60v-src increased the amount of total complexes bound at this site (data not shown). We had previously shown that the cyclin D1 CRE/ATF site binds CREB in human choriocarcinoma (JEG-3) cells (56Watanabe G. Howe A. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Shu I.-W. Karnezis A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Rundell K. Pestell R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12861-12866Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The CRE/ATF site contributed to induction of the cyclin D1 promoter by the SV40 small t antigen (56Watanabe G. Howe A. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Shu I.-W. Karnezis A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Rundell K. Pestell R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12861-12866Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and was important in serum-induced cyclin D1 expression in MEFs (54Brown J.R. Nigh E.

In MEFs, we observed a serum-inducible complex consisting primarily of FOS/CREB proteins binding this site (54Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J. Ye H. Thompson M.A. Saudou F. Pestell R.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5609-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In MEFs derived from mice homozygously deleted of the c-fos and fosB genes (c-fos −/−/fosB−/−), the serum-induced proliferation rate was reduced in association with a loss of serum-induced cyclin D1 mRNA and protein (54Brown J.R.

Together with the observation that cyclin D1 −/− MEFs are reduced in their proliferative response to serum (54Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J. Ye H. Thompson M.A. Saudou F. Pestell R.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5609-5619Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), these studies were consistent with a role for FOS proteins and the cyclin D1 CRE/ATF site in serum responsiveness of the cyclin D1 gene in MEFs. The cyclin A promoter contains a CRE/ATF binding site that bound ATF1, CREB1, and ATFa2 in HeLa cell extracts (73Wang E.H. Zou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This region of the cyclin A promoter was important in activation by TAFII250. Cells mutant in TAFII250 are defective in cell cycle progression and have reduced cyclin D1 and cyclin A transcription, suggesting an important link between cellular proliferation and the CREB/ATF family of proteins (73Wang E.H. Zou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).The dominant negative mutant of CREB reduced pp60v-src-induced cyclin D1 expression by 70%. CREB activity was induced by pp60v-src, and the induction was abolished by mutation of Ser133. CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 is induced by protein kinase A (60Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R.

Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar), through a growth factor-induced MAPK/ERK cascade (which was prevented by PD98059 (49Pende M. Fisher T.L. Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. Blenis J. Gallo V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and by FGF through a p38/MAP kinase-activated protein pathway (50Tan Y. Rousse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In the current studies, SB203580 reduced pp60v-src induction of CREB activity by 50%, suggesting a role for the p38 pathway. Unlike previous studies in glial cell progenitors in which growth factor-induced phosphorylation of CREB was sensitive to PD98059 (49Pende M. Fisher T.L. Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. Blenis J. Gallo V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway enhanced pp60v-src induction of CREB activity in MCF7 cells. As with the induction of CREB phosphorylation by FGF (50Tan Y. Rousse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), our studies suggest that CREB activation by pp60v-src at Ser133 is at least in part dependent upon the p38 pathway.ATF-2 binds to and is phosphorylated by JNKs and p38, and both the ERKs and JNK enhance ATF-2 transcriptional activity (45Livingstone C.

The signaling pathways regulating ATF-2 function in breast cancer cells were not known. In the current studies, pp60v-src induced ATF-2 activity and mutation of threonines 69 and 71 dramatically inhibited both basal and pp60v-src induced activity. Recently, the JIP-1 protein was identified and shown to bind JNK in the cytoplasm, interfering with JNK nuclear translocation and activity (61Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z.

Nuclear import of PTHrP was assessed in vitro using purified components, demonstrating that importin β, together with the GTP-binding protein Ran, was able to mediate efficient nuclear accumulation in the absence of importin α, whereas the addition of nuclear transport factor NTF2 reduced transport.

These observations are consistent with the idea that cell cycle-dependent regulation of nuclear localization of PTHrP is central to the control of growth and apoptosis (2Henderson J.E. Sebag M.

In the case of T-ag, the CcN motif CK2 and cyclin-dependent kinase sites strongly regulate NLS function and the kinetics of nuclear import (16Jans D.A. Ackermann M. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.H. Peters R.

Based on the observation that nuclear PTHrP effects an increase in mitogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells, Massfelderet al. (5Massfelder T. Dann P. Wu T.L. Vasavada R. Helwig J.-J. Stewart A.F.

In the present study we use recombinant and synthetic PTHrP peptides encompassing various regions of PTHrP to demonstrate for the first time that PTHrP can be internalized by receptor-expressing UMR106.01 cells and localize rapidly in the nucleus and nucleolus. In addition we show that in contrast to conventional NLS-containing proteins, PTHrP is recognized with high affinity by the β and not the α subunit of the importin heterodimer. We map the specific region of PTHrP recognized by importin β and show that it alone, in concert with the GTP-binding protein Ran, can mediate nuclear accumulation of PTHrP in a reconstituted nuclear import assay system. We conclude that PTHrP localizes in the nucleus through a novel import pathway, possibly shared by other importin β-recognized proteins such as HIV Rev (18Henderson B.R. Principalle G. J. Mol.

We initially tested whether PTHrP could localize in the nucleus/nucleolus subsequent to receptor-mediated endocytosis. FITC-PTHrP 1–108 was incubated with UMR106.01 osteoblast cells without or with (nonspecific binding) preincubation/coincubation with an excess of unlabeled ligand, and subcellular localization was visualized and quantitated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 2). Nuclear/nucleolar uptake reached maximal levels (4- and over 13-fold, respectively) by about 40 min (Fig. 2B). It could be blocked by an excess of either unlabeled PTHrP 1–108 (Fig. 2) or unlabeled PTHrP 1–34 (not shown), which is responsible for PTHrP binding to the PTHrP receptor, indicating that the uptake was receptor-mediated and thus comparable with that of other nuclear localizing ligands such as interleukin-5 (35Jans D.A.

The ability of PTHrP to localize in the nucleus in intact cells implied that PTHrP may possess a functional NLS (Fig. 1A). We accordingly set out to quantitate the binding of mouse importin subunits to purified polypeptides and synthetic peptides encompassing various parts of PTHrP using an ELISA-based assay (22Hübner S.

Surprisingly, we found that PTHrP 1–108 and 35–141 were recognized with high affinity by importin β and not importin α (Fig. 3, top panels, and TableI). Maximal binding by importin α was only about 50% that of importin β, whereas the K dvalues for PTHrP 1–108/35–141 and importin β were 3.5 and 1.8 nm, respectively, about 2 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding values for importin α (Table I). The unexpected finding that PTHrP was recognized by mImpβ and not Impα was confirmed using importin subunits from yeast (31Rexach M. Blobel G.

Based on their high gene sequence homology, these enzymes appear to be phylogenetically linked (8Gang D.R. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1997; 658: 58-89Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). They also share comparable physiological roles for their products, in addition to having presumed similar catalytic modes of action, as shown in Fig. 1, A and B. In recent years, a relatively large number of reductases with significant homology to both PLRs and IFRs (so-called IFR “homologs”) have also been discovered (8Gang D.R. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1997; 658: 58-89Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), mainly through screening for genes induced by fungal elicitors (9Hibi N. Higashiguchi S.

To date, at least 19 such “homologs” have been reported in both woody and nonwoody angiosperms and gymnosperms, in plants as diverse as Arabidopsis thaliana (11Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Belles-Boix E.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 618-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Their roles in planta, however, have not been established; of those examined for enzymatic activity, none were able to catalyze either the reduction of isoflavones (9Hibi N. Higashiguchi S. Hashimoto T. Yamada Y. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 723-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) or the reduction of pinoresinol-lariciresinol-type (8–8′-linked) lignans (see below). Thus, their biochemical function has been unknown. Lignans and isoflavonoids play important roles in plant defense. For example, their constitutive deposition significantly helps confer durability, longevity, and resistance to the heartwoods of many tree species against wood-rotting fungi. In this regard, western red cedar (T. plicata) heartwood formation results via deposition of ∼20% of 8–8′-linked lignans, such as plicatic acid 7(15MacLean H. Gardner J.A.F. Forest Prod.

Phytochemistry. 1969; 8: 345-351Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2), which help permit this species to grow to well over 60 meters tall and live for longer than 3000 years. The heartwoods of many Pinaceae species, such as loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), also contain significant levels of 8–5′-linked (phenylcoumaran) lignans such as dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol 5 (see Fig. 1C), dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol 8 (Fig. 2), and related metabolites. These and their higher molecular weight (non-lignin) derivatives are laid down in the heartwood as protective postlignification infusions (4Gang D.R. Fujita M. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1998; 697: 389-421Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Additionally, many tropical legume tree species contain significant levels of pterocarpan isoflavonoids, such as pterocarpin 9 in Pterocarpus indicus, thereby allowing these species to thrive in an environment highly conducive to fungal growth. Remarkably, almost nothing is known about the biochemistry of heartwood formation (4Gang D.R. Fujita M. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1998; 697: 389-421Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), despite the fact that it is responsible for ∼90% of all woody biomass. Lignans and isoflavonoids can also reputedly act as phytoalexins (8Gang D.R. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1997; 658: 58-89Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar,24Dixon R.A. Harrison M.J. Paiva N.L. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 93: 385-392Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), in both woody and non-woody species, being formed de novo in response to fungal attack. For example, the 8–8′-linked lignan, (−)-matairesinol 10, is produced inPicea abies in response to attack from Fomes annosus (25Shain L. Hillis W.E. Phytopathology. 1971; 61: 841-845Crossref Google Scholar), whereas the pterocarpan isoflavonoid, (−)-medicarpin 11, accumulates in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) when exposed to Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (26Kessmann H. Edwards R. Geno P.W. Dixon R.A. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Lignan formation is not limited to significant deposition in heartwood and tissues attacked by fungi. For example, the 8–5′-linked lignans, dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol triacetate 12 and tetrahydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol tetraacetate 13, accumulate in small amounts in the leaves of Cryptomeria japonica (27Su W.-C. Fang J.-M. Cheng Y.-S. Phytochemistry. 1995; 40: 563-566Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (DDC)5 and its 7′-8′ (allylic bond)-reduced derivative, dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol 8 (DDDC), appear to be ubiquitous throughout the plant kingdom, being found in plants as diverse as loblolly pine (P. taeda) (28Nose M. Bernards M.A. Furlan M. Zajicek J. Eberhardt T.L. Lewis N.G. Phytochemistry. 1995; 39: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), tobacco (29Binns A.N. Chen R.H. Wood H.N. Lynn D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), ferns (30Satake T. Murakami T. Saiki Y. Chen C.-M. Chem. Pharm. Bull.

Heterocycles. 1997; 46: 795-848Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), i.e. spanning all major groups of vascular plants and suggesting the involvement of a universal defense system. Interestingly, the 8–5′-linked lignans can also co-occur in many species with their (presumed) phenylcoumaran benzylic ether-reduced counterparts. As shown in Fig. 3, this includes examples such as dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol triacetate 12 with tetrahydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol tetraacetate 13 inC. japonica (27Su W.-C. Fang J.-M. Cheng Y.-S. Phytochemistry. 1995; 40: 563-566Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and hancinone 14 with isodihydrofutoquinol A 15 in Piper wightii (32Prasad A.K. Tyagi O.D. Wengel J. Boll P.M.

Parmar V.S. Acta Chem. Scand. 1994; 48: 1007-1011Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast to the 8–8′-linked lignans and the isoflavonoids (1Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,5Paiva N.L. Edwards R. Sun Y. Hrazdina G. Dixon R.A. Plant Mol.

Ser. 1997; 658: 58-89Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Dixon R.A. Harrison M.J. Paiva N.L. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 93: 385-392Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), however, there has been no explicit description of the biochemical pathways and enzymes involved in either the formation or subsequent metabolism of 8–5′-linked lignans. From a biochemical perspective, enzymatic reduction of the benzylic ether of 8–5′-linked lignans, such as DDC 5 and DDDC8, might involve an analogous process to that envisaged for reduction of pinoresinol 1 (Fig. 1A) and isoflavonoids, such as 2′-hydroxypseudobaptigenin 3 (Fig. 1B), e.g. through formation and reduction of conjugated enone intermediates, as shown in Fig. 1C, or through reduction of some other enzyme-bound molecular species. Accordingly, we deduced that the PLR and IFR “homologs” may, in fact, be phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductases (PCBERs). In order to test this hypothesis, and since suspension culture cells of the gymnosperm, loblolly pine, contain DDC 5, DDDC8 (28Nose M. Bernards M.A. Furlan M. Zajicek J. Eberhardt T.L. Lewis N.G. Phytochemistry. 1995; 39: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and related metabolites, we first constructed a cDNA library from RNA isolated from P. taeda suspension culture cells growing in 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-containing medium (34van Heerden P.S. Towers G.H.N. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12350-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Next, when the F. intermediapinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase cDNA was used as a probe, a “homolog” cDNA from loblolly pine was isolated, with its recombinant protein subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli. This protein, in the presence of NADPH, reduced the benzylic ether functionalities of both DDC 5 and DDDC 8. Another IFR “homolog” from the angiosperm, poplar (P. trichocarpa)4, when similarly expressed and tested for PCBER activity, also effected the same conversion. These findings thus identified a catalytic function for this class of enzymes as being capable of engendering phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reduction. This finding thus provided evidence that the so-called IFR “homologs” are indeed phylogenetically linked to PLR and IFR and demonstrated further the evolution and conservation of the phenylpropanoid pathway throughout the plant kingdom (8Gang D.R. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Am. Chem. Soc. Symp. Ser. 1997; 658: 58-89Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast to the enantiospecific PLR and IFR, however, the phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductases only displayed regiochemical specificities, since both (+)- and (−)-enantiomers of DDC 5 were effectively reduced. P. taeda cell suspension cultures were maintained as described previously (34van Heerden P.S. Towers G.H.N. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12350-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), in Brown and Lawrence medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Cells were harvested by filtration 7 days after transfer to fresh media, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Populus deltoides × P. trichocarpa, clone 064 (Afocel, France) and P. trichocarpa cv. Trichobel were grown in the Institute of Forestry and Game Management nursery (Geraardsbergen, Belgium). All molecular biological techniques, unless expressly described otherwise below, were performed according to standard methods (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Protein purification procedures using a fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) system were carried out at 4 °C, whereas those employing the BioCad (PerSeptive Biosystems) system were conducted at ambient temperature. All chromatographic eluents were monitored at 280 nm. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein determination kit. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis used gradient (4–15% linear gradient; Bio-Rad) gels under denaturing and reducing conditions in the Laemmli buffer system (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), followed by visualization of the proteins by silver staining (38Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). All solvents and chemicals used were reagent or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade.Taq thermostable DNA polymerase, competent NovaBlue cells, and radiolabeled nucleotide ([α-32P]dCTP) were purchased from Promega, Novagen, and NEN Life Science Products, respectively. The pCRII TA cloning kit was from Invitrogen. Restriction endonuclease NdeI was from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Geneclean II® kits for PCR fragment purification were from BIO 101 Inc., with the gel-purified DNA concentrations determined by comparison with a low DNA mass ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1.3% agarose gels. A Lambda 6 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer) was used for recording all RNA and DNA determinations atA260, and a Temptronic II thermocycler (Thermolyne) was employed for all PCR amplifications. The Wizard® Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System (Promega) was used to purify plasmid DNA for sequencing using an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated sequencer. All HPLC separations were performed on either a MillenniumTM (Waters Inc.) or AllianceTM (Waters Inc.) instrument. Amino-terminal protein sequencing was carried out as described previously (1Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was performed on a VG 7070 at the Laboratory for Bioanalysis and Biotechnology at Washington State University. Total RNA (100 μg/g, fresh weight) was obtained using the method of Dong and Dunstan (39Dong J.Z. Dunstan D.I. Plant Cell Rep. 1996; 15: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) from frozen loblolly pine (P. taeda) cells grown as described above. A P. taeda cDNA library was constructed using 5 μg of purified poly(A)+ mRNA (Oligotex-dTTM suspension; Qiagen) with the ZAP-cDNA® synthesis kit, the Uni ZAPTM XR vector, and the Gigapack® II Gold packaging extract (Stratagene), with a titer of 1 × 106 plaque-forming units for the primary library. The amplified library (1 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml; 120 ml total) was used for screening (1Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The 5′-end of the previously isolated pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase cDNA (PLR-Fi1) was used to construct a probe, as described previously (1Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), to screen the P. taeda cDNA library for similar/homologous genes. 600,000 plaque-forming units of the P. taeda amplified cDNA library were screened for genes homologous to PLR-Fi1. This was done exactly as described by Dinkova-Kostova et al. (1Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), with the exception that hybridization temperatures were reduced to 45 °C. 20 positive plaques were purified through two more rounds of screening. Purified cDNA clones were rescued from the phage following Stratagene's in vivoexcision protocol. Both strands of several different cDNAs that coded for genes homologous to PLR-Fi1 were completely sequenced using overlapping sequencing primers. DNA and amino acid sequence analyses were performed using the Unix-based GCG Wisconsin Package (40Genetics Computer Group The GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package, Version 8.0. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI1994Google Scholar, 41Rice P. Program Manual for the EGCG Package. The Sanger Centre, Hinxton Hall, Cambridge, England1996Google Scholar) and the ExPASy World Wide Web molecular biology server (42Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of the putative reductase from P. taeda was in frame with the β-galactosidase gene α-complementation particle in pBluescript. Thus, its recombinant fusion protein was expressed in NovaBlue cells as described previously (1Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and then assayed for both phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase and pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase activities, as described below. The overexpression plasmid, pSBETa (43Schenk P.M. Baumann S. Mattes R. Steinbiss H.-H. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 196-200PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the NdeI restriction site for native expression, was used. Since the putative reductase from P. taeda had no internal NdeI sites, two primers were designed to introduce NdeI sites at the start methionine (primer PT-ATG-NdeI, TTC AGG GCC CAT ATG GGA AGC AGG AGC AGG ATA CTC) and in the 3′-end untranslated region (primer PT-Rev-NdeI, TGT CGA ATA CAT ATG AAA GGC GAT AAC CAA CAA TTT). These two primers (5 pmol each) were used in five PCRs with 10 ng of the cDNA encoding the P. taeda putative reductase as described (1Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29473-29482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pCRII plasmid according to Invitrogen's instructions. The resulting pCRII plasmid containing the putative reductase was purified and digested with NdeI, with the resulting ∼1-kilobase pair fragment gel purified and ligated into pSBETa previously digested with NdeI and transformed into competent NovaBlue cells. The resulting pSBET construct containing the putative phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase was purified, and the expression region, containing the desired cDNA, was sequenced completely on both strands to verify that no mutations had been introduced during PCR (see Fig. 4). The amino acid sequence of the protein was then compared with PLR and IFR amino acid sequences (see Fig. 5).Figure 5Amino acid sequence alignment of the P. taedaand poplar PCBER, similar isoflavone reductase “homologs”, PLRs, and IFRs.

High level expression of the putative reductase was achieved by inoculating 1 liter of LB broth, supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, with 2–4 ml of an overnight grown 10-ml culture in the same medium. The cells were then allowed to grow at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until a density of A600 = 0.65 was reached, at which point the growth conditions were changed to 20 °C with shaking at 265 rpm. Production of the reductase was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm final concentration, once the cells had reached a temperature of ∼22 °C (about 30 min after the incubator temperature was turned down). The cells were then allowed to grow for 21 h before harvest by centrifugation for 25 min at 3000 × gin 4 × 250-ml centrifuge bottles, after which the pellets were frozen for at least 2 h at −80 °C to aid in cell lysis. The four pellets were thawed at room temperature and resuspended in 2 × 10 ml each of Buffer A (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0; 2 mm EDTA; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 5 mm DTT) and then combined and sonicated for 3 × 30 s. The sonicates were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g to pellet cellular debris and filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter. The resulting filtrate (290 ml) was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation, with the 40–70% ammonium sulfate saturation fraction, after centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g, desalted back into Buffer A over PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 1.6-cm diameter, 11.5-cm-long (23-ml bed volume) Affi-Gel blue gel (Bio-Rad) column was preequilibrated in Buffer A. The desalted 40–70% fraction (15 ml, 513 mg) was then applied to the column. After washing with 300 ml of Buffer A (1 ml/min), the reductase was eluted by running a linear gradient from 0 to 100% Buffer B (Buffer A plus 5 m NaCl) in 30 ml, holding at 100% Buffer B for 60 ml and returning from 100% Buffer B to 100% Buffer A in 30 ml. 4-ml fractions were collected, with the reductase being eluted in fractions 33–43. These fractions were then pooled, concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml in a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon, Inc.), desalted over PD10 columns, and assayed for activity. The resulting enzyme solution (118 mg) was next applied to a POROS 20 QE Perfusion anion exchange column, preequilibrated in Buffer C (50 mm Bis-Tris propane, pH 6.8, 5 mm DTT). The desired protein did not bind to the column, whereas the majority of the contaminating E. coli proteins remained bound under these conditions. The resulting enzyme solution (59 mg) was next applied to a POROS 20 SP Perfusion cation exchange column, preequilibrated in Buffer C. Again, the desired protein did not bind to the column, whereas the rest of the contaminating E. coli proteins remained bound. 36 mg of purified reductase protein were thus obtained, this being apparently homogeneous, as revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with visualization by silver staining (see Fig. 6 and “Results and Discussion”). Wood of P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa,clone 064, was sampled in May 1992 by removal of a 2-year-old branch from a 20-year-old tree and separating the bark from the wood. Wood pieces were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. These were subsequently used for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent microsequencing of the most abundant protein in the gels. 5K. Vander Mijnsbrugge, G. Bauw, M. Van Montagu, and W. Boerjan, manuscript in preparation. For the sampling of P. trichocarpa cv. Trichobel, 3-year-old trees were harvested, with the bark again separated, and the selected woody tissues immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Woody tissue (∼10 cm long) was obtained from the stem 10 cm above ground level. A root sample was also harvested at ∼5 cm below ground level. Peptide sequences obtained from the most abundant protein in two-dimensional protein gels of the wood sampled from P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa, clone 064, were as follows: 1) TGYIGK, 2) PTFALV, 3) GVTLIHGDV, 4) FFPSEFGM, 5) TFVPETK, and 6) TTVEEYLDQFV.5 The amino acid sequence of two internal peptides (numbers 3 and 4 above) and one C-terminal peptide (number 6) were next used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers: PT primer 2 (GGI GTI ACI (C/T)TI ATI CA(C/T) GGI GA(C/T) GT); reverse PT primer 5"
https://openalex.org/W1983398711,"Stat5b gene disruption leads to an apparent growth hormone (GH) pulse insensitivity associated with loss of male-characteristic body growth rates and male-specific liver gene expression (Udy, G. B., Towers, R. P., Snell, R. G., Wilkins, R. J., Park, S. H., Ram, P. A., Waxman, D. J., and Davey, H. W. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 7239–7244). In the present study, disruption of the mouse Stat5a gene, whose coding sequence is ∼90% identical to the Stat5b gene, resulted in no loss of expression in male mice of several sex-dependent, GH-regulated liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. By contrast, the loss of STAT5b feminized the livers of males by decreasing expression of male-specific CYPs (CYP2D9 and testosterone 16α-hydroxylase) while increasing to female levels several female-predominant liver CYPs (CYP3A, CYP2B, and testosterone 6β-hydroxylase). Since STAT5a is thus nonessential for these male GH responses, STAT5b homodimers, but not STAT5a-STAT5b heterodimers, probably mediate the sexually dimorphic effects of male GH pulses on liver CYP expression. In female mice, however, disruption of either Stat5a or Stat5bled to striking decreases in several liver CYP-catalyzed testosterone hydroxylase activities. Stat5a or Stat5b gene disruption also led to the loss of a female-specific, GH-regulated hepatic CYP2B enzyme. STAT5a, which is much less abundant in liver than STAT5b, and STAT5b are therefore both required for constitutive expression in female but not male mouse liver of certain GH-regulated CYP steroid hydroxylases, suggesting that STAT5 protein heterodimerization is an important determinant of the sex-dependent and gene-specific effects that GH has on the liver. Stat5b gene disruption leads to an apparent growth hormone (GH) pulse insensitivity associated with loss of male-characteristic body growth rates and male-specific liver gene expression (Udy, G. B., Towers, R. P., Snell, R. G., Wilkins, R. J., Park, S. H., Ram, P. A., Waxman, D. J., and Davey, H. W. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 94, 7239–7244).

The cytochrome P450s (CYPs) 1The abbreviations used are: CYP, cytochrome P450; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GH, growth hormone; bp, base pair(s) are a superfamily of heme proteins that hydroxylate steroid hormones and other endogenous chemicals as well as numerous drugs and environmental carcinogens. CYPs are highly expressed in liver, where they are subject to complex hormonal regulation and sex-dependent expression. Prototypic examples of sex-specific liver CYPs in the rat model are the male-specific CYP2C11 (testosterone 16α- and 2α-hydroxylase) and the female-specific CYP2C12 (steroid sulfate 15β-hydroxylase) (1Waxman D.J. Chang T.K.H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1995: 391-417Crossref Google Scholar). Marked sex-dependent differences in hepatic CYP profiles are also seen in the mouse, where CYP2D9 (a testosterone 16α-hydroxylase) and CYP2A4 (a testosterone 15α-hydroxylase) are expressed in males and females, respectively, in certain strains (2Noshiro M. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15923-15927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,3Wong G. Kawajiri K. Negishi M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8683-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sexually dimorphic expression of a mouse CYP2B testosterone 16α-hydroxylase has also been described (4Noshiro M.

The expression of these sexually dimorphic liver steroid hydroxylase CYPs is primarily determined by the sexual dimorphism of plasma growth hormone (GH) profiles (2Noshiro M. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15923-15927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Waxman D.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 1055-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Mode A. Tollet P.

Intermittent plasma GH pulses, a characteristic of adult male rats, induce expression of male-specific CYP proteins and their associated steroid hydroxylase activities, while the near continuous presence of GH in the plasma of adult female rats induces expression of female-specific and female-dominant liver CYP proteins (1Waxman D.J.

Agrawal A.K. Shapiro B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6868-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The plasma GH pattern in mice is pulsatile in both sexes; however, sex-specific responses of liver CYPs to plasma GH profiles can be discerned by the distinct frequency of pulsation in males (interpulse interval of ∼2.5 h) and females (interpulse interval <1 h) (11MacLeod J.N. Pampori N.A. Shapiro B.H. J. Endocrinol. 1991; 131: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Pulsatile GH, but not continuous GH, strongly activates the signal transducer and transcriptional activator STAT5 in rat liver (12Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). STAT5 was originally identified in lactating mammary gland as a prolactin-inducible transcription factor (13Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Subsequently, two highly conserved (∼90% identical in coding sequence) STAT5 genes,Stat5a and Stat5b, were identified and found to be expressed in many tissues (14Mui A.L.F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 15Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both STAT5 forms can be activated in tissue culture by multiple cytokines and growth factors, including GH, erythropoietin, epidermal growth factor, and various interleukins (14Mui A.L.F. Wakao H.

STAT5 proteins thus have the potential to contribute to multiple signaling pathways associated with cell growth and differentiation. The proposed mediation by STAT5 of GH pulse-regulated, sexually dimorphic liver gene expression (12Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) is supported by the finding of a functional STAT5 response element in the promoter region of several male-specific, GH pulse-regulated genes (22Subramanian A. Wang J. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2173-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 2S. H. Park and D. J. Waxman, unpublished observations. In addition, targeted disruption of Stat5b leads to a major loss of multiple, sexually differentiated responses associated with pulsatile GH secretion (23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), demonstrating that this GH pulse-activatable transcription factor (12Waxman D.J. Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13262-13270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) is essential for maintaining sexually dimorphic body growth rates and liver gene expression. During mammary gland differentiation, STAT5a and STAT5b both undergo prolactin-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation and bind as a heterodimeric STAT5a-STAT5b complex at γ-interferon activation-like regulatory sites (TTCNNNGAA), such as that found in the mouse β-casein promoter (13Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 24Liu X. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1496-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Stat5a gene disruption has demonstrated that STAT5a is critically required to activate and/or repress yet unknown target genes that promote mammary gland differentiation and lactogenesis (25Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Mammary gland STAT5b can only partially fill this function and then again only after repeated hormonal stimulation through multiple pregnancies and episodes of suckling (26Liu X. Gallego M. Smith G.H. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 795-803PubMed Google Scholar). Although targeted disruption of Stat5b leads to the loss of multiple sexually differentiated responses governed by a pulsatile plasma GH profile (23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), it is uncertain whether this loss reflects a requirement for heterodimeric STAT5a-STAT5b complexes or perhaps an absolute requirement for homodimeric STAT5b-STAT5b complexes for GH pulse-regulated liver gene expression. STAT5a and STAT5b exhibit differences with respect to their tissue distribution (14Mui A.L.F. Wakao H. O'Farrell A.M. Harada N. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1166-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 15Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) and DNA binding specificities (27Verdier F. Rabionet R. Gouilleux F. Beisenherz-Huss C. Varlet P. Muller O. Mayeux P. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Chretien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5852-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and in the sequences of their COOH-terminal transcription activation domain (28Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). These two STATs could thus have distinct functions with respect to their role in GH signaling and its impact on the sexual dimorphism of liver gene expression. To address the role of STAT5a in the GH-regulated sexual dimorphism of liver gene expression, we have examined the effects ofStat5a gene disruption on hepatic CYP enzyme activities and protein expression. 129J congenic Stat5b −/−mice were also examined to verify and extend using an inbred mouse strain our earlier findings (23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) on the effects of Stat5bgene disruption in 129J × BALB/c outbred mice. Evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that heterodimerized (STAT5a-STAT5b) and homodimerized (STAT5b-STAT5b) STAT5 complexes play distinct roles in the sexually differentiated responses of the liver to GH. Generation of Stat5a and Stat5b gene-disrupted mice has been described (23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 25Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the effects of STAT5b deficiency in a congenic 129J background, chimeric male mice (derived from 129J ES cells) were mated with 129J females. The Stat5b +/− progeny were then bred to obtain the 129J congenicStat5b −/− and Stat5b +/+mice used for these experiments. Experiments usingStat5a −/− mice were carried out using littermates obtained from 129J × Black Swiss outbred mice. In all cases, comparisons of wild-type and STAT5-deficient mice were made between littermates obtained from the crossing of heterozygote siblings or of heterozygote females with null male siblings, all containing the same 129J outcrossed background. Accordingly, strain-specific P450 allelic determinants are expected to segregate randomly in both wild-type and Stat5 gene-disrupted mice. Efforts to obtain liver tissue from 129J congenic Stat5a −/− mice for direct comparison to the 129J congenicStat5b −/− mice were unsuccessful, since these animals proved very difficult to breed. Although the possibility cannot formally be excluded that a 129J-derived regulatory determinant of liver CYP gene expression is tightly linked to the Stat5locus and contributes to some of the liver CYP profile differences between wild-type and Stat5a −/− 129J × Black Swiss mice, this is considered unlikely. Mouse liver tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Liver (about 1 g) was homogenized in 10 ml of homogenizing buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mmsucrose) with the addition of phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmsodium orthovanadate and 10 mm sodium fluoride) and a protease inhibitor (100 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 15 min to obtain a total tissue homogenate. Ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 1 h was carried out to separate microsomal pellets and the cytosolic supernatant. Microsomal pellets were suspended in KPi buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 20% glycerol, and stored at −80 °C until use. Microsomal protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay kit (Sigma). Cytosolic and total tissue homogenate protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Dc detergent protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against mouse STAT5a amino acids 774–793 and mouse STAT5b amino acids 776–786 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (sc-1081 and sc-835, respectively). These STAT5 antibodies were shown to be specific for STAT5a or STAT5b, respectively, under our Western blotting conditions. Some cross-reactivity was apparent in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) supershift analysis (see Fig. 2B). Mouse monoclonal anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT3 antibodies purchased from Transduction Laboratories were raised against STAT1 amino acids 591–731 (S21120) and STAT3 amino acids 1–178 (S21320), respectively. Anti-rat CYP3A (mouse monoclonal antibody 2-3-2) (29Waxman D.J. Lapenson D.P. Park S.S. Attisano C. Gelboin H.V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 615-624PubMed Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal anti-rat CYP2B1 (30Waxman D.J. Walsh C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10446-10457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse CYP2D9 antibodies (31Harada N. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12285-12290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used for Western blot analysis of microsomal CYP proteins. Anti-mouse CYP2D9 (anti-C-P45016α) was generously provided by Dr. M. Negishi (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC). Liver cytosolic protein (40 μg) and microsomal protein (20 μg) prepared from 8–9-week-old wild-typeStat5a −/− orStat5b −/− mice were electrophoresed through standard Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% gels for STAT protein separation and 8% gels for mouse microsomal CYP protein separation), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then probed with anti-STAT or anti-CYP antibodies. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 3% nonfat dry milk (Blotto) and 1% bovine serum albumin in a high Tween buffer (0.3% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) for anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT3 or with 2% Blotto and 2% bovine serum albumin in TST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, 100 mm NaCl) for probing with anti-STAT5a and anti-STAT5b. For microsomal CYP Western blotting, membranes were blocked with 3% Blotto and 1% bovine serum albumin in TST buffer. Incubations with primary antibody were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C at dilutions of 1:3000. Antibody binding was visualized on x-ray film by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Nitrocellulose membranes were reprobed after stripping in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2% SDS, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 20 min at 50 °C. Results are presented in figures prepared from grayscale scans of portions of the x-ray films of each blot. Scans were obtained using a Cannon IX-4015 scanner outfitted with Ofoto scanning software. Microsomal metabolism of testosterone was assayed as described previously (32Waxman D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 462-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using 25 μg of mouse liver microsomal protein incubated in 0.2 ml containing 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 3 mmMgCl2, and 14C-labeled testosterone (10 nmol, ∼100,000 cpm). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.36 mm NADPH and terminated 20 min later by the addition of 1 ml of ethyl acetate. Testosterone and hydroxytestosterone metabolites were extracted with ethyl acetate and then chromatographed on silica gel TLC plates developed in solvent A (methylene chloride/acetone (80:20, v/v)) and then solvent B (chloroform/ethyl acetate/ethyl alcohol (70:17.5:12.5, v/v/v)). TLC plates were exposed overnight to PhosphorImager plates followed by quantitation using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager instrument and ImageQuant software (Sunnyvale, CA). In order to assess the homogeneity and identity of individual radiolabeled testosterone metabolites, radioactive spots of interest were cut from the aluminum-backed TLC plates, and the 14C-labeled monohydroxytestosterone metabolites were then eluted with ethyl acetate. Unlabeled authentic hydroxytestosterone metabolites were then individually cospotted with each of the unknown14C-metabolites to verify co-migration in two independent TLC solvent systems (32Waxman D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 462-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Total liver homogenate protein (15 μg) was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 9 μl of gel mobility shift buffer (12.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 10 fmol of DNA probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Manheim), 5% glycerol, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 625 μm EDTA, and 625 μm dithiothreitol). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing the STAT5 response element of the rat β-casein promoter (nucleotides −101 to −80; 5′-GGA-CTT-CTT-GGA-ATT-AAG-GGA-3′) was 32P-end-labeled on one strand using T4 kinase and then incubated with the protein sample for 20 min at room temperature and then 10 min on ice to stabilize the STAT5-DNA gel shift complex (33Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For supershift analysis, an additional 10-min incubation in the presence of STAT antibodies was carried out after the addition of the labeled DNA probe. Samples were electrophoresed in a cold room through a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (5.5% acrylamide, 0.07% bisacrylamide) (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) in 0.5 × TBE buffer (44.5 mm Trizma-base, 44.5 mm boric acid, 5 mm EDTA) following a 30-min preelectrophoresis step. After electrophoresis of the samples into the gel for 20 min at 120 V, the gel apparatus was moved to room temperature to increase the speed of protein migration. In some cases, the electrophoresis time was increased and/or the percentages of acrylamide and bisacrylamide gel were increased to 6.5% and 0.08%, respectively, to increase the resolution of the STAT5-containing EMSA complexes. Total RNA was isolated from ∼100 mg of mouse liver using TRIZOL Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer by adding 7 μl of a master mix reaction buffer (1.5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 mm dNTPs, 0.1 m dithiothreitol) to 2 μg of RNA and 100 ng of random hexamer primer. Samples were incubated, first for 50 min at 42 °C and then for 15 min at 70 °C. RNase H (1 μl, 2 units) was then added, followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C. 2 μl of each cDNA sample was amplified in 50 μl of PCR reaction mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 2 mm dNTPs, and 100 ng of each STAT5 PCR primer (see below)). Amplification was conducted in a Stratagene thermal cycler at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min 10 s, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s for 30 cycles. RNA that was not reverse transcribed was included as a negative control to verify the absence of genomic DNA or PCR product contamination. The efficiency of RNA extraction and of reverse transcription was determined by including β-actin-specific primers as an internal control in each PCR reaction. The STAT5 primers used in the experiment (forward primer, 5′-CAG GTG AAG GCG ACC ATC AT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TG CTG TTG TAG TCC TCG AGG-3′) amplify both STAT5a and STAT5b cDNA to produce a 550-base pair PCR product using a protocol kindly provided by Dr. M. Negishi. To determine the relative STAT5a and STAT5b mRNA levels in mouse liver, the STAT5 PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and then digested withNcoI restriction endonuclease (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). PCR-amplified STAT5a cDNA obtained using the above primers contains a single NcoI restriction site, which when cut yields fragments 240 and 310 bp in length, while PCR-amplified STAT5b cDNA does not contain the NcoI cutting site. Purified PCR products were digested with NcoI (2 units) in New England BioLabs buffer 4 for 2 h at 37 °C. PCR products and 1-kilobase pair molecular marker were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and their relative levels were quantitated using ImageQuant software. Individual group comparisons were performed using the two-tailed Student's t test (p ≤ 0.05). Liver cytosols prepared fromStat5a −/− mice were assayed for the expression of individual STAT proteins by Western blotting. Wild-type mice showed similar levels of liver cytosolic STAT5a protein in both males and females, with some differences between individual animals apparent (Fig. 1, lanes 1,2, and 7–9). No STAT5a protein was detected in the Stat5a −/− mice of either sex. Reprobing with antibodies to other STAT proteins revealed that STAT5b, STAT1, and STAT3 protein levels were not significantly changed by the Stat5a gene disruption. This contrasts to the increase in liver STAT1 in Stat5b −/− mice (23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). STAT3 was present in liver at a significantly higher level in females than in males in the 129J × Black Swiss mice used in the present study (Fig. 1, bottom panel, lanes 7–13 versus lanes 1–6). No sex difference in hepatic STAT3 levels was seen, however, in 129J or in 129J × BALB/c mice (data not shown). Our previous study of Stat5b −/− mice (23Udy G.B. Towers R.P. Snell R.G. Wilkins R.J. Park S.H. Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. Davey H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7239-7244Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) was carried out using 129J × BALB/c outbred mice. Since there are significant strain differences in the patterns of CYP enzyme expression in mouse liver (4Noshiro M. Serabjit-Singh C.J. Bend J.R. Negishi M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 244: 857-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Ford H.C. Lee E. Engel L.L. Endocrinology. 1979; 104: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Negishi M. Burkhart B. Aida K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we generatedStat5b −/− mice in the 129J inbred strain in order to eliminate random genetic contributions from the 129J × BALB/c outcrossed background to individual animal variation. Examination of the Stat5b −/− 129J congenic mice revealed effects of STAT5b disruption on liver STAT protein expression similar to those seen earlier in outbred mice; STAT1 levels were increased, while the expression of STAT3 and STAT5a was unchanged (data not shown). We next used a STAT5-binding DNA probe from the rat β-casein gene in an EMSA of total liver homogenates to examine the functional (DNA binding) activity of STAT5b protein inStat5a −/− mice. STAT5 protein present inStat5a −/− mouse liver was active in this DNA binding assay (Fig. 2A,lane 1). Given the absence of STAT5a protein in these livers, we conclude that the DNA complex detected is composed of STAT5b-STAT5b homodimers. These homodimers migrated distinctly faster than STAT5a homodimers, which are present in liver homogenates prepared from Stat5b −/− mice (lanes 4 and 5). A corresponding fast mobility complex was formed by a GH pulse-activated rat liver homogenate (lane 8), in agreement with earlier studies indicating that STAT5b is the major STAT5 protein in this tissue (36Ripperger J.A.

Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The major complex observed in wild-type mice migrated at an intermediate mobility compared with that present inStat5a −/− and Stat5b −/− mice (lanes 2,3, 6, and 7), indicating the presence of STAT5a-STAT5b heterodimers. The presence of STAT5 homo- or heterodimers in these liver samples was further investigated by supershift analysis using anti-STAT5a and anti-STAT5b antibodies (Fig. 2B). Anti-STAT5b antibody fully supershifted the STAT5b-containing DNA complex present inStat5a −/− mice (Fig. 2B,lane 9). A supershift complex of similar mobility was obtained in wild-type mouse liver (lanes 6and 12) and in male rat liver (lane 3), suggesting that these tissues contain homodimeric STAT5b-STAT5b complexes in addition to the intermediate mobility STAT5a-STAT5b heterodimeric complexes evident from Fig. 2A. Some cross-reactivity of this anti-STAT5b antibody with STAT5a-STAT5a homodimers was apparent, however, as revealed by the more rapidly migrating supershift complex obtained withStat5b −/− mouse liver samples (lane 15). This latter complex was not present in significant amounts in wild-type mouse liver (lanes 6 and 12) or male rat liver (lane 3), indicating that the majority of activated STAT5a is complexed as a heterodimer with STAT5b in wild-type liver. Anti-STAT5a antibody yielded a nearly complete supershift of the STAT5a-STAT5a complexes present in Stat5b −/− mouse liver (lane 14) but only a partial supershift of the STAT5-containing complexes present in wild-type mice (lanes 5 and 11) or in male rat liver (lane 2). The supershift pattern obtained with anti-STAT5a antibody is consistent with the presence of both STAT5b-STAT5b homodimer and STAT5a-STAT5b"
https://openalex.org/W2156028877,"UDP-glucose: anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase (5-GT) is responsible for the modification of anthocyanins to more stable molecules in complexes for co-pigmentation, supposedly resulting in a purple hue. The cDNA encoding 5-GT was isolated by a differential display applied to two different forms of anthocyanin production in Perilla frutescens var. crispa. Differential display was carried out for mRNA from the leaves of reddish-purple and green forms of P. frutescens, resulting in the isolation of five cDNA clones predominantly expressed in the red form. The cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 460 amino acids, exhibiting a low homology with the sequences of several glucosyltransferases including UDP-glucose: anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase. By using this cDNA as the probe, we also isolated a homologous cDNA clone from a petal cDNA library of Verbena hybrida. To identify the biochemical function of the encoded proteins, these cDNAs were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The recombinant proteins in the yeast extracts catalyzed the conversion of anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides into the corresponding anthocyanidin 3,5-di-O-glucosides using UDP-glucose as a cofactor, indicating the identity of the cDNAs encoding 5-GT. Several biochemical properties (optimum pH, Km values, and sensitivity to inhibitors) were similar to those reported previously for 5-GTs. Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of two copies of 5-GT genes in the genome of both red and green forms of P. frutescens. The mRNA accumulation of the 5-GT gene was detected in the leaves of the red form but not in those of the green form and was induced by illumination of light, as observed for other structural genes for anthocyanin biosynthesis in P. frutescens."

We have identified a glucose transporter ofP. falciparum (PfHT1) and studied its function and expression during parasite development in vitro. PfHT1 is a saturable, sodium-independent, and stereospecific transporter, which is inhibited by cytochalasin B, and has a relatively high affinity for glucose (K m = 0.48 mm) when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Competition experiments with glucose analogues show that hydroxyl groups at positions C-3 and C-4 are important for ligand binding. mRNA levels for PfHT1, assessed by the quantitative technique of tandem competitive polymerase chain reaction, are highest during the small ring stages of infection and lowest in gametocytes. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy localizes PfHT1 to the region of the parasite plasma membrane and not to host structures. These findings have implications for development of new drug targets in malaria as well as for understanding of the pathophysiology of severe infection. When hypoglycemia complicates malaria, modeling studies suggest that the high affinity of PfHT1 is likely to increase the relative proportion of glucose taken up by parasites and thereby worsen the clinical condition.

When hypoglycemia complicates malaria, modeling studies suggest that the high affinity of PfHT1 is likely to increase the relative proportion of glucose taken up by parasites and thereby worsen the clinical condition. Malaria is one of the most important pathogenic protozoa and is responsible for more than 1 million deaths each year. Antimalarial drug resistance is developing rapidly in different geographical areas and is severely curtailing therapeutic options (1White N.J. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Asexual multiplication of intraerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum is a prerequisite for the development of clinical symptoms and lethal outcome in malarial infection (2Newton C.R. Krishna S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 1-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). At this stage, parasites are dependent on glucose from the host as a source of energy (3Sherman I.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1979; 43: 453-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and metabolize glucose anaerobically. Increases in metabolic demands are associated with enlargement of parasites within erythrocytes before the stage of nuclear division (4Zolg J.W. Macleod A.J. Scaife J.G. Beaudoin R.L. In Vitro. 1984; 20: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There is an approximately 100-fold increase in the utilization of glucose by maturing parasites when compared with uninfected erythrocytes. This induced increase in uptake of glucose is accompanied by increased production and export of lactic acid by infected cells (4Zolg J.W. Macleod A.J. Scaife J.G. Beaudoin R.L. In Vitro. 1984; 20: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Studies on intact infected erythrocytes have suggested that P. falciparum obtains its glucose through an equilibrative mechanism (5Kirk K. Horner H.A. Kirk J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) which may involve a saturable carrier associated with the parasite itself (6Goodyer I.D. Hayes D.J. Eisenthal R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, these types of studies assess mechanisms of glucose transport indirectly, because multiple membrane systems are involved in analysis. More detailed assessment of the enzymatic characteristics of a proposed glucose transporter from the malarial parasite can only be individually assessed in heterologous expression systems.Previously, we have hypothesized that asexual stages of parasites encode substrate-specific transporters that are located in the region of the developing parasite's plasma membrane (7Penny J.I. Hall S.T. Woodrow C.J. Cowan G. Gero A.M. Krishna S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These transporters are presumed to act in conjunction with important changes in the permeability properties of the infected erythrocyte membrane to regulate the uptake of substrates by parasites. As a preliminary test of this hypothesis, we microinjected Xenopus laevis oocytes with mRNA obtained from cultured P. falciparum and demonstrated significantly increased uptake of several substrates or analogues of metabolism including 2′-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DOG) 1The abbreviations used are: 2-DOG, 2′-deoxy-d-glucose; PfHT1, Plasmodium falciparumhexose transporter 1; GLUT1, human facilitative glucose transporter 1; 6-DOG, 6′-deoxy-d-glucose; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TC-PCR, tandem competitive PCR; K i, half-maximal inhibition constant for carrier transport; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline 1The abbreviations used are: 2-DOG, 2′-deoxy-d-glucose; PfHT1, Plasmodium falciparumhexose transporter 1; GLUT1, human facilitative glucose transporter 1; 6-DOG, 6′-deoxy-d-glucose; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TC-PCR, tandem competitive PCR; K i, half-maximal inhibition constant for carrier transport; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline and lactate (7Penny J.I. Hall S.T. Woodrow C.J. Cowan G. Gero A.M. Krishna S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).We have now identified a parasite-encoded hexose transporter that is localized to the region of the parasite plasma membrane within the infected red cell. Quantitation of mRNA encoding this transporter during the asexual and gametocyte stages of the parasite's life cycle suggests that its expression is under developmental control. Functional studies on this transporter in Xenopus oocytes have confirmed that it is a facilitative transporter with relatively high affinity for glucose. These findings have identified a key parasite-encoded substrate transporter that is a potentially novel drug target, as well as establishing the value of a heterologous expression system for the study of malarial transport proteins.DISCUSSIONGlucose is the main energy source for asexual stages of P. falciparum (3Sherman I.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1979; 43: 453-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isolation of a novel parasite-encoded hexose transporter is therefore of fundamental biological interest. A number of findings suggest that PfHT1 is the major hexose transporter for intraerythrocytic parasites. We have established that PfHT1is a single copy gene with no close homologues of PfHT1discernible from examination of both Southern and Northern blots under conditions of low stringency for hybridization and washing. PfHT1 is expressed as a single transcript (Fig. 3) that varies considerably in abundance during the life cycle of P. falciparum. The pattern of expression of PfHT1 mRNA, which peaks sharply 8 h after invasion of the red cell (Fig. 4), is consistent with anticipation of a rapid rise in glucose consumption as ring forms mature to become trophozoites (4Zolg J.W. Macleod A.J. Scaife J.G. Beaudoin R.L. In Vitro. 1984; 20: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A sustained secondary rise inPfHT1 mRNA levels may serve to maintain glucose supply as parasites begin to divide. Thus the variation in abundance of mRNA encoding PfHT1 is consistent with the changes in glucose utilization as asexual stage parasites mature in cells. Interestingly, gametocytes expressed the lowest relative abundance of PfHT1mRNA suggesting that high levels of glucose uptake may not be critical at this stage of the infection.When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, PfHT1 mediates sodium-independent uptake of hexoses (Fig. 2). The uptake of glucose analogues in intact P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes is also sodium-independent (5Kirk K. Horner H.A. Kirk J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and saturable (6Goodyer I.D. Hayes D.J. Eisenthal R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the predicted K m for 6-DOG uptake into parasites (∼5 mm) derived after modeling from studies in infected erythrocytes (6Goodyer I.D. Hayes D.J. Eisenthal R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is consistent with our K i estimate for 6-DOG (2.2 mm). Taken together these observations support assignment of PfHT1 as the principal hexose transporter in asexual stages of parasite development. A number of controversial mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increase in permeability of host-derived structures to metabolites of parasites (16Desai S. Krogstad D.J. McCleskey E.W. Nature. 1993; 362: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 17Kirk K. Horner H. Elford B.C. Ellory J.C. Newbold C.I. J. Biol.

Nature. 1991; 353: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Whatever the nature of these important mechanisms, primary regulation of nutrient uptake and export of products of metabolism takes place across the parasite plasma membrane, because axenically grown parasites are capable of completing the asexual stage of development (20Trager W. Williams J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5351-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Localization by confocal microscopy and Western blotting experiments demonstrate that PfHT1 is associated with the parasite plasma membrane and not the erythrocyte membrane. PfHT1 therefore provides an example of a molecular mechanism for transport of substrates into the parasite, in which substrate-specific transporters act in conjunction with alterations in surrounding membrane structures to supply nutrients to the parasite (7Penny J.I. Hall S.T. Woodrow C.J. Cowan G. Gero A.M. Krishna S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Heterologous expression systems avoid the difficulties of studying transport across the multiple membranes of the infected erythrocyte and will become increasingly important as the malaria-sequencing initiative evolves. The high AT content of parasite DNA does not interfere with expression in the Xenopus oocyte system.The isolation of a parasite-encoded facilitative hexose transporter permits studies focussing on differences between the well characterized human hexose transporter family of sequences (GLUT1 to GLUT5) and the newly isolated malarial homologue. We have already shown that PfHT1 requires an appropriately positioned hydroxyl group in the C-4 position of hexoses, a property which distinguishes it from human GLUT1 (21Gould G. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Such differences may be used as a basis for the design of compounds selectively toxic to the parasite.The >10-fold higher affinity for d-glucose shown by PfHT1 compared with GLUT1 may result in important physiological consequences. Infected erythrocytes adhere to microvasculature when parasites mature giving rise to organ-specific complications such as cerebral malaria and the metabolic complications of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis (2Newton C.R. Krishna S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 1-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties of PfHT1 suggest that there is potential for infected erythrocytes to divert this substrate away from host tissues. This may be particularly important in cerebral microvessels, because the brain relies on glucose, which is transported by GLUT1 through the blood-brain barrier (22Pardridge W.M. Boado R.J. Pardridge W.M. The Blood-Brain Barrier: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Raven Press, New York1993: 395-440Google Scholar). The magnitude of this metabolic diversion is further predicted to increase during episodes of hypoglycemia (plasma glucose ≤ 2.2 mm). These observations may also explain how parasites continue to develop even when glucose delivery becomes rate-limiting for cerebral metabolism, for example during episodes of hypoglycemia which frequently (∼20% of cases) (2Newton C.R. Krishna S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 1-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) complicate the condition of cerebral malaria.Our characterization of a P. falciparum-encoded high affinity hexose transporter identifies an attractive potential drug target because antimalarials used in the management of severe malaria take many hours to achieve maximum inhibition of glucose utilization (13ter Kuile F. White N.J. Holloway P.H. Pasvol G. Krishna S. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 76: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of PfHT1 may be rapidly parasitocidal as well as interfering with pathophysiological processes in cerebral malaria. Malaria is one of the most important pathogenic protozoa and is responsible for more than 1 million deaths each year. Antimalarial drug resistance is developing rapidly in different geographical areas and is severely curtailing therapeutic options (1White N.J. J. Antimicrob.

Pardridge W.M. The Blood-Brain Barrier: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Raven Press, New York1993: 395-440Google Scholar). The magnitude of this metabolic diversion is further predicted to increase during episodes of hypoglycemia (plasma glucose ≤ 2.2 mm). These observations may also explain how parasites continue to develop even when glucose delivery becomes rate-limiting for cerebral metabolism, for example during episodes of hypoglycemia which frequently (∼20% of cases) (2Newton C.R. Krishna S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 1-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) complicate the condition of cerebral malaria.Our characterization of a P. falciparum-encoded high affinity hexose transporter identifies an attractive potential drug target because antimalarials used in the management of severe malaria take many hours to achieve maximum inhibition of glucose utilization (13ter Kuile F. White N.J. Holloway P.H. Pasvol G. Krishna S. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 76: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of PfHT1 may be rapidly parasitocidal as well as interfering with pathophysiological processes in cerebral malaria. Glucose is the main energy source for asexual stages of P. falciparum (3Sherman I.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1979; 43: 453-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The isolation of a novel parasite-encoded hexose transporter is therefore of fundamental biological interest. A number of findings suggest that PfHT1 is the major hexose transporter for intraerythrocytic parasites. We have established that PfHT1is a single copy gene with no close homologues of PfHT1discernible from examination of both Southern and Northern blots under conditions of low stringency for hybridization and washing. PfHT1 is expressed as a single transcript (Fig. 3) that varies considerably in abundance during the life cycle of P. falciparum. The pattern of expression of PfHT1 mRNA, which peaks sharply 8 h after invasion of the red cell (Fig. 4), is consistent with anticipation of a rapid rise in glucose consumption as ring forms mature to become trophozoites (4Zolg J.W. Macleod A.J. Scaife J.G. Beaudoin R.L. In Vitro. 1984; 20: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A sustained secondary rise inPfHT1 mRNA levels may serve to maintain glucose supply as parasites begin to divide. Thus the variation in abundance of mRNA encoding PfHT1 is consistent with the changes in glucose utilization as asexual stage parasites mature in cells. Interestingly, gametocytes expressed the lowest relative abundance of PfHT1mRNA suggesting that high levels of glucose uptake may not be critical at this stage of the infection. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, PfHT1 mediates sodium-independent uptake of hexoses (Fig. 2). The uptake of glucose analogues in intact P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes is also sodium-independent (5Kirk K. Horner H.A. Kirk J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and saturable (6Goodyer I.D. Hayes D.J. Eisenthal R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the predicted K m for 6-DOG uptake into parasites (∼5 mm) derived after modeling from studies in infected erythrocytes (6Goodyer I.D. Hayes D.J. Eisenthal R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) is consistent with our K i estimate for 6-DOG (2.2 mm). Taken together these observations support assignment of PfHT1 as the principal hexose transporter in asexual stages of parasite development. A number of controversial mechanisms have been proposed to explain the increase in permeability of host-derived structures to metabolites of parasites (16Desai S. Krogstad D.J. McCleskey E.W. Nature. 1993; 362: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 17Kirk K. Horner H. Elford B.C. Ellory J.C. Newbold C.I. J. Biol.

Nature. 1991; 353: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Whatever the nature of these important mechanisms, primary regulation of nutrient uptake and export of products of metabolism takes place across the parasite plasma membrane, because axenically grown parasites are capable of completing the asexual stage of development (20Trager W. Williams J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5351-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Localization by confocal microscopy and Western blotting experiments demonstrate that PfHT1 is associated with the parasite plasma membrane and not the erythrocyte membrane. PfHT1 therefore provides an example of a molecular mechanism for transport of substrates into the parasite, in which substrate-specific transporters act in conjunction with alterations in surrounding membrane structures to supply nutrients to the parasite (7Penny J.I. Hall S.T. Woodrow C.J. Cowan G. Gero A.M. Krishna S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression systems avoid the difficulties of studying transport across the multiple membranes of the infected erythrocyte and will become increasingly important as the malaria-sequencing initiative evolves. The high AT content of parasite DNA does not interfere with expression in the Xenopus oocyte system. The isolation of a parasite-encoded facilitative hexose transporter permits studies focussing on differences between the well characterized human hexose transporter family of sequences (GLUT1 to GLUT5) and the newly isolated malarial homologue. We have already shown that PfHT1 requires an appropriately positioned hydroxyl group in the C-4 position of hexoses, a property which distinguishes it from human GLUT1 (21Gould G. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Such differences may be used as a basis for the design of compounds selectively toxic to the parasite. The >10-fold higher affinity for d-glucose shown by PfHT1 compared with GLUT1 may result in important physiological consequences. Infected erythrocytes adhere to microvasculature when parasites mature giving rise to organ-specific complications such as cerebral malaria and the metabolic complications of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis (2Newton C.R. Krishna S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 1-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The enzymatic properties of PfHT1 suggest that there is potential for infected erythrocytes to divert this substrate away from host tissues. This may be particularly important in cerebral microvessels, because the brain relies on glucose, which is transported by GLUT1 through the blood-brain barrier (22Pardridge W.M. Boado R.J. Pardridge W.M. The Blood-Brain Barrier: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Raven Press, New York1993: 395-440Google Scholar).

However, the basis of this CHX-induced apoptosis has not been clearly established. In this study, the molecular mechanisms of CHX-induced cell death were examined in two different human T-cell lines. In T-cells undergoing CHX-induced apoptosis (Jurkat), but not in T-cells resistant to the effects of CHX (CEM C7), caspase-8 and caspase-3 were activated. However, the Fas ligand was not expressed in Jurkat cells either before or after treatment with CHX, suggesting that the activation of these caspases does not involve the Fas receptor. To determine whether CHX-induced apoptosis was mediated by a Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-dependent mechanism, a FADD-DN protein was expressed in cells prior to CHX treatment. Its expression effectively inhibited CHX-induced cell death, suggesting that CHX-mediated apoptosis primarily involves a FADD-dependent mechanism. Since CHX treatment did not result in the induction of Fas or FasL, and neutralizing anti-Fas and anti-tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 antibodies did not block CHX-mediated apoptosis, these results may also indicate that FADD functions in a receptor-independent manner. Surprisingly, death effector filaments containing FADD and caspase-8 were observed during CHX treatment of Jurkat, Jurkat-FADD-DN, and CEM C7 cells, suggesting that their formation may be necessary, but not sufficient, for cell death.

Although a number of stimuli have been reported to result in the up-regulation of the Fas receptor and its ligand (e.g. UV, c-Myc, and certain chemotherapeutic drugs), there are many other stimuli for which the mechanism responsible for their action is still unknown (7Rehemtulla A.

Shinzawa H. Takahashi T. Sendo F. J. Immunol. 1995; 157: 2403-2412Google Scholar) further indicated that CHX, independently of other stimuli, is also capable of promoting apoptosis in a number of transformed cell lines and normal cells. Jacobsonet al. (16Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) have shown that staurosporine- and staurosporine/cycloheximide-induced death is mediated by a caspase-3-like activity that is blocked by Z-VAD-FMK, a synthetic tripeptide inhibitor that demonstrates broad caspase specificity. More recently, Woo et al. (17Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) demonstrated that bone marrow neutrophils from caspase-3−/− mice no longer undergo CHX-induced apoptosis, indicating that caspase-3 expression is most likely required for this type of cell death. The ability of CHX to induce cell death varies considerably from one cell line to another, suggesting that the continuous synthesis of a regulatory protein that blocks apoptosis is required for the normal growth of these CHX-sensitive cell lines (12Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2464-2469PubMed Google Scholar, 13Martin S.J. Lennon S.V. Bonham A.M. Cotter T.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1859-1867PubMed Google Scholar). Sensitivity to CHX is not necessarily determined by cell type alone since cell lines from the same tissue and stage of development (e.g. Jurkat and CEM C7 T-cells) can be affected in very different ways. Furthermore, although cell death triggered by cell-surface receptors (e.g. Fas, DR3, and TNF receptor-1) requires an adaptor protein such as FADD to promote an apoptotic signal, cell death triggered by other stimuli (e.g. E1A, c-Myc, and Adriamycin) may not (18Chinnaiyan A.M.

Therefore, it is of interest to determine the basis of the cellular differences that result in cellular sensitivity or insensitivity to agents like CHX as well as the mechanism of CHX-induced apoptosis. The transformed human T-cell lines Jurkat and CEM C7 are representative of a similar T-cell developmental stage, and they are equally sensitive to agonistic anti-Fas mAbs and TNFα (25Gottlieb R.A.

However, they exhibit disparate responses when exposed to CHX. We therefore set out to determine which apoptotic signaling pathway components are involved in CHX-induced Jurkat cell death as well as the basis for the CEM C7 cellular resistance to CHX. Here we demonstrate that disruption of normal FADD function inhibits apoptotic signaling in these cells. This may indicate that in addition to its role as an adaptor that links TNF-related receptors to caspase activation, FADD mediates certain apoptotic signals through a receptor-independent pathway(s). Finally, we demonstrate that FADD and caspase-8 (FLICE) coalesce into what appear to be perinuclear death effector filaments (DEFs) (27Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 28Perez D. White E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) in wild-type Jurkat, Jurkat-FADD-DN, and CEM C7 cells treated with CHX, even though only the wild-type Jurkat cells apoptose. These results suggest that the redistribution of FADD and caspase-8 into these filament structures is necessary, but not sufficient, for cell death to occur. Human Jurkat cells and CEM C7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. This particular Jurkat cell line contains a mutation in the baxgene that results in a functionally inactive, truncated protein (29Brimmell M. Mendiola R. Mangion J. Packham G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1803-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For Fas-induced cell death analysis, cells at a density of 1.5 × 106 were treated with an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody, CH-11 (Kamiya Biomedical Co.), at 100 ng/ml for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. CHX-induced cell death was performed by incubating the cells in 20 μg/ml CHX for 6 h, and staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis was accomplished by incubating cells with various concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 μm) of STS for 4 h. Apoptotic cells were examined with a light microscope for appearance of plasma membrane blebbing and by TUNEL assay (30Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9100) Google Scholar), and the percentage of apoptotic cells was quantitated as described below. The Jurkat-Neo and Jurkat-FADD-DN cell lines were generated by resuspending 107 Jurkat cells in 0.3 ml of the cell growth medium containing 12 μg of either pcDNA3.0 or PCDNA3.0/FADD-DN (kindly provided by Dr. V. Dixit), which were then electroporated using a 4-mm gap cuvette at 0.25 kV and 960 microfarads. Cells were cultured for 48 h before addition of G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1 mg/ml. After 4 weeks of selection in the G418 medium, a subpopulation of non-clonal, transfected cells expressing a moderate to high level of FADD-DN was selected by exposing cells to an agonistic anti-Fas mAb (CH-11) at 100 ng/ml for 72 h. The surviving cells (∼20% of the original population) were then expanded. In contrast to FADD-DN-transfected Jurkat cells, virtually no pcDNA3.0-transfected Jurkat cells (<0.1%) survived this treatment. FACS analysis demonstrated that most of the Jurkat-FADD-DN cells (>95%) expressed levels of cell-surface Fas receptor equivalent to the original Jurkat cell population and the Jurkat-Neo cells. By Western blot analysis, the Jurkat-FADD-DN cells were found to express levels of wild-type FADD and caspase-8 equivalent to the levels expressed in the Jurkat-Neo and Jurkat cells. For Western blotting, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Boehringer Mannheim). 50 μg of cell lysate was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). The resulting membrane was blocked with 10% skim milk and incubated with a designated primary antibody, and the signals were detected by use of an ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The anti-caspase-8/FLICE mAb (C15) (31Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol.

Krammer, whereas the anti-caspase-3 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-FADD (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Fas (MBL Co.

Anti-Fas mAb (CH-11)-, CHX-, and STS-induced caspase activation in Jurkat and CEM C7 cells was monitored by cleavage of the endogenous caspase substrate PARP using Western blot analysis. Cytochrome c release from mitochondria was determined according to a previously published protocol (33Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4241) Google Scholar). Experiments involving the effects of caspase inhibitors on cytochrome c release in the presence of CHX were performed as follows. Jurkat cells were incubated in 50 μm Z-FA-FMK, Z-YVAD, Z-IETD, Z-DEVD, or Z-VAD-FMK (Enzyme System Products) before addition of CHX to cells to initiate cell death. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL assay (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer. The percentage of apoptotic cells during agonistic CH-11 antibody treatment was quantitated by FACS (32Tang D. Gururajan R. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16601-16607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The percentage of apoptotic cells during CHX treatment was quantitated by FACS for annexin V-positive and propidium iodide-negative cells (34Engeland M.V. Ramaekers F.S. Schutte B.

Briefly, 106 Jurkat cells were treated with CHX for 6 h, and the cells were then stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide. Jurkat, Jurkat-FADD-DN, Jurkat-Neo, or CEM C7 cells were prepared for immunofluorescence by cytospin. These cells were either left untreated or treated with an agonistic anti-Fas mAb for 4 h, with 20 μg/ml CHX for 6 h, or with 20 μg/ml CHX for 6 h in the presence of a 50 μm concentration of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK before being prepared for analysis (32Tang D.

Cells were then fixed and stained with an anti-FADD mAb and anti-caspase-8 polyclonal antiserum (goat anti-human IgG, SC-6134, Santa Cruz) as described previously (36Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-FADD mAb was detected using a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL), and the anti-caspase-8 polyclonal antibody was detected using an FITC-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (Southern Biotechnology) with an Olympus BX-50 fluorescent microscope as described (36Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that CHX can augment many different death signals, presumably through its ability to inhibit the synthesis of a protective factor, as well as induce apoptosis on its own (12Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2464-2469PubMed Google Scholar, 13Martin S.J. Lennon S.V. Bonham A.M. Cotter T.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1859-1867PubMed Google Scholar, 14Tsuchida H. Takeda Y. Takei H.

In fact, cell lines derived from the same source (e.g. lymphoid cells) respond quite differently when exposed to CHX; some (e.g. Jurkat T-cells) rapidly undergo apoptosis, whereas others (e.g. CEM C7 T-cells) do not (25Gottlieb R.A. Nordberg J. Skowronski E. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar,26Geley S. Hartmann B.L. Hattmannstorfer R. Loffler M.

To explore the possible molecular mechanisms involved in this response, we examined the ability of CHX to induce cell death in Jurkat and CEM C7 cells. As little as 5 μg/ml CHX was capable of inducing apoptosis in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1) within 4–6 h, whereas even 20 μg/ml did not induce CEM C7 cell death over a 48-h time period (data not shown). For these initial experiments, cleavage of the nuclear caspase substrate PARP in CHX-treated Jurkat cells was used as a biochemical marker of apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Annexin V staining of cell-surface phosphatidylserine was used as a measure to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells present (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, a much higher level of cytochrome c was released from the mitochondria into the cytosol of CHX-treated Jurkat cells compared with CHX-treated CEM C7 cells (Fig. 2). To demonstrate that cytochrome c release was not due to physical disruption of the mitochondria, proteins corresponding to the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions of the CHX-treated Jurkat and CEM C7 cells were Western-blotted with an antibody to cytochrome oxidase (subunit II) (Fig. 2). Cytochrome oxidase is a protein that is not released from the mitochondria during apoptosis (37Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). If the cytoplasmic cytochromec in the Jurkat cells were generated by physical disruption of the mitochondria or mitochondrial contamination, one would expect to see cytochrome oxidase present in this cell fraction as well. No cytochrome oxidase was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction from the CHX-treated Jurkat cells, whereas a small amount was detected in the CEM C7 cells. The former result demonstrates that the mitochondria from the Jurkat cells were intact, whereas the latter result suggests that the CEM C7 cell mitochondria were slightly damaged, and/or the cytosol was contaminated with a low level of mitochondria. This explains the small amount of cytochrome c in the cytoplasmic fraction from the CHX-treated CEM C7 cells (Fig. 2).Figure 2Release of cytochrome c into the cytosol of CEM C7 and Jurkat T-cells in the absence (−) and presence (+) of CHX. 40 μg of cytosolic protein was Western-blotted with an anti-cytochromec antibody in the top panels to determine whether this protein was released from mitochondria in response to CHX treatment. In the bottom panels, cytosolic (cyto) and mitochondrial (mito) proteins from CHX-treated CEM C7 or Jurkat T-cells were Western-blotted with an antibody to mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase to determine whether the cytosolic fractions were contaminated with mitochondria.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects of treatment of Jurkat cells with 20 μg/ml CHX on PARP cleavage, release of cytochrome c, and annexin V staining in Jurkat cells during 8 h of exposure were assessed (Fig. 1B). All three were induced with similar kinetics. Since these results suggested that caspase-dependent apoptosis was being triggered, we examined the effect of CHX treatment on the processing of several caspases (Fig. 1C). Caspase-3 (CPP32/YAMA) activation, as judged by the appearance of the 17-kDa subunit, started to occur within 2 h. The processing of caspase-2 and caspase-8, as judged by the appearance of their 17–18-kDa subunits, started to occur within 2–4 h of CHX treatment. This suggests either that our ability to detect activation of caspase-8 was limited by the sensitivity of the reagents we used or that caspase-3 is responsible for the processing and activation of caspase-8 during CHX-induced Jurkat cell death. Since caspase-8 is activated in CHX-treated Jurkat cells, and it appears that this activity might be linked to a cellular commitment to death, we decided to examine the effects of a dominant-negative form of FADD on this process. Others have shown that expression of a FADD-DN protein, containing the death domain but not the death effector domain, is capable of effectively inhibiting a number of different receptor-mediated apoptotic signals (18Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar, 21Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S.

The same FADD-DN expression construct was stably introduced into Jurkat cells, and the truncated protein was constitutively expressed along with endogenous FADD (Fig. 3A). Jurkat cells transfected with the empty expression vector (Neo) were used as a control. Since it has been shown that expression of the FADD-DN protein effectively inhibits Fas-mediated cell death, we examined the ability of these cells to survive Fas receptor oligomerization. As measured by cell viability (FITC-conjugated annexin V staining) and two different biochemical markers (i.e. PARP cleavage and caspase-8 processing), these Jurkat-FADD-DN cells were resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis induced by an agonistic anti-Fas mAb (Fig. 3A). We next examined the ability of CHX and STS, a broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor that induces caspase-dependent apoptosis independently of cell-surface death receptors (16Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 39Bertrand R. Solary E. O'Connor P. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), to trigger cell death in the Jurkat-FADD-DN cells. PARP cleavage and cell death, as measured by the percentage of annexin V-positive cells, were significantly inhibited in the FADD-DN cells as compared with the Neo controls as the cells were exposed to increasing amounts of CHX (Fig. 3B). However, the ability of STS to induce PARP cleavage and apoptosis was not significantly diminished. The effect of FADD-DN expression on the ability of CHX and STS to induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, which is involved in the propagation of several apoptotic signals (40Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was examined next. FADD-DN expression did not significantly inhibit the release of cytochrome c in the CHX- or STS-treated cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, although the FADD-DN protein inhibited CHX-induced cell death as measured by the use of an FITC-conjugated anti-annexin V antibody, it did not have a similar effect on STS-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3B). There are at least two possibilities to explain how FADD-DN expression can interfere with CHX-induced Jurkat cell death. One is to block CHX-induced cytochrome c release; the other is to block caspase activation, downstream of cytochromec release. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we first examined CHX-induced cytochrome c release in both Jurkat-Neo and Jurkat-FADD-DN cells. Fig. 3B shows that expression of the FADD-DN protein did not prevent cytochromec release induced by CHX or STS. Conversely, FADD-DN expression inhibited caspase-8 activation in CHX- and STS-treated cells (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, FADD-DN expression also efficiently inhibited caspase-3 activation induced by CHX treatment, but not by higher doses of STS (Fig. 3D). Since FADD-DN expression had no apparent effect on cytochrome c release in both CHX- and STS-treated cells, the inhibition of caspase-3 processing in CHX-treated Jurkat-FADD-DN cells may be the result of caspase-8 inhibition. This possibility is further supported by the fact that at higher doses of STS (>0.3 μm), caspase-8 processing continued to be inhibited by FADD-DN expression (Fig. 3C), whereas caspase-3 processing was not (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results suggest that expression of the FADD-DN protein directly inhibits caspase-8 processing, whereas it may indirectly inhibit caspase-3 processing through its effects on caspase-8. The ability of FADD-DN expression to inhibit caspase processing is reflected by its ability to inhibit cell death, as judged by PARP cleavage and the percentage of FITC-conjugated annexin V-positive cells (Fig. 3B). Based on these results, we decided to examine the effects of various caspase inhibitors on cytochrome c release in Jurkat cells treated with CHX. Fig. 4 shows that none of these caspase inhibitors prevented the release of cytochromec from mitochondria during CHX-induced Jurkat cell death, whereas cell death was inhibited (data not shown). Others have shown that, significantly, caspase inhibitors do not prevent cytochromec release induced by a number of non-receptor apoptotic stimuli, including STS (6Reed J.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). These data, coupled with that from the Jurkat cells expressing the FADD-DN protein, suggest that cytochromec release is upstream of caspase activation in Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis in response to CHX. We discuss the possible mechanisms and implications of these observations below. How does FADD, a death receptor adaptor protein, mediate receptor-independent apoptotic signals? Recently, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of either FADD or caspase-8 induces apoptosis through the formation of unique cellular filament structures that contain the death effector domains of these proteins (27Siegel R.M.

Sgk is localized to the perinuclear or cytoplasmic compartment as a 50-kDa hypophosphorylated protein in cells arrested in G1 by treatment with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. In serum-stimulated cells, Sgk was transiently hyperphosphorylated and resided in the nucleus. Laser scanning cytometry, which monitors Sgk localization and DNA content in individual mammary tumor cells of an asynchronously growing population, revealed that Sgk actively shuttles between the nucleus (in S and G2/M) and the cytoplasm (in G1) in synchrony with the cell cycle. In cells synchronously released from the G1/S boundary, Sgk localized to the nucleus during progression through S phase. The forced retention of exogenous Sgk in either the cytoplasmic compartment, using a wild type sgkgene, or the nucleus, using a nuclear localization signal-containingsgk gene (NLS-Sgk), suppressed the growth and DNA synthesis of serum-stimulated cells.

The regulation of cell signaling events in the nucleus for the coordinate control of target genes allows cells to respond to external stimuli in a physiologically appropriate manner. The nuclear import of protein kinases provides one mechanism for modulating cellular signal transduction pathways that functionally complement or potentially couple multiple growth factor pathways to steroid receptor signaling. Several classes of protein kinases, such as protein kinase A, certain isoforms of protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Jun N-terminal kinase, and p90rsk, can translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate a select group of transcription factors, such as c-Jun and c-Fos components of the AP-1 complex, whose expression and/or activity is targeted by steroid receptor signaling (14Karin M.

Several of the protein kinases implicated in the nuclear cross-talk between steroid receptor signaling and growth factor-induced pathways are involved in the regulation of proliferative or anti-proliferative responses. For example, in T cells, glucocorticoids down-regulate the phosphorylation of the basal and activated forms of the p70S6K/p85S6K kinase (37Monfar M. Blenis J. Mol.

Subtractive cloning of glucocorticoid-responsive genes from a Con8 mammary tumor cell cDNA library was used to identify genes involved in the glucocorticoid-mediated growth suppression response.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11482-11485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sgk promoter contains a functional glucocorticoid response element that accounts for its glucocorticoid inducibility (51Maiyar A.C. Phu P.T. Huang A.J. Firestone G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 312-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and is a transcriptional target of the p53 tumor suppressor protein (52Maiyar A.C. Huang A.J. Phu P.T. Cha H.H. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12414-12422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The existence of this novel transcriptionally regulated protein kinase suggests a new pathway of cross-talk by which glucocorticoid receptor-mediated and phosphorylation-dependent cell signaling can be coordinated and therefore implicates Sgk as a potential target in the control of cell proliferation. The sgk gene encodes a 50-kDa protein with 431 amino acids that shows strong homology (45–54% amino acid identity) to the catalytic domains of other serine/threonine protein kinases, such as Akt (54%), the rat p70S6K/p85S6K kinases (50%), rat protein kinase C-β (48%), and the mouse protein kinase A (45%) (22Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Several members of these protein kinase gene families that are homologous to sgk are involved in cell signaling events that are associated with the control of cell growth and differentiation (3Johnson G.L. Vaillancourt R.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 5Firestone G.L. Maiyar A.C. Ramos R.A. Firestone G.L. Maiyar A.C. Ramos R.A. Timiras P.S.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation, activity, and in some cases the cellular location of these protein kinases can be regulated in response to specific extracellular stimuli. Thus, even thoughsgk gene expression is under an acute transcriptional control by several distinct pathways, the cellular utilization of Sgk protein may also be highly regulated under conditions in which the mammary tumor cells are either growth-arrested by glucocorticoids or actively proliferating in the presence of serum. In this study, we demonstrate that the nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization of Sgk is under stringent hormonal and cell cycle control, and we also provide evidence that the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of Sgk may be required for the ability of the mammary tumor cells to be actively progressing through the cell cycle. Con8.dh6 mammary epithelial tumor cells were routinely cultured on standard tissue culture plates in DMEM/F-12 (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% calf serum (BioWhittaker) and penicillin/streptomycin (BioWhittaker) and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 as described (39Webster M.K. Guthrie J. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4831-4838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Webster M.K. Guthrie J. Firestone G.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6031-6038PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with serum-free medium prior to their treatment with the indicated concentrations of serum and/or 1 μm dexamethasone for the indicated times. In the appropriate experiments, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) (Sigma) was added to a final concentration 100 μm for 30 min. For cell synchronization, hydroxyurea was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to 30% confluent cells for 24 h, after which 95% of the cell population was found to be in G1 phase of the cell cycle, as determined by flow cytometry. For radiolabeling with [32P]orthophosphate (10 mCi/ml H2O, NEN Life Science Products), Con8.hd6 cells were grown to 30% confluency before they were serum-deprived for 48 h. The cells were then incubated in phosphate-free DMEM for 1 h, followed by incubation in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with the indicated combinations of serum-free conditions, 10% dialyzed calf serum, and/or 1 μm dexamethasone for 4 h. Cells were pulse-labeled for 1 h with 0.5 mCi of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate in 4 ml of incubation medium. Cells were harvested, and Sgk was immunoprecipitated using the affinity purified polyclonal anti-Sgk antibodies and protein A beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden). Final beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. To express Sgk in bacteria, the pET HAX-Sgk expression vector was generated for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced Sgk expression in HMS 174. For this purpose, an NdeI fragment containing the full-length and sequenced sgk open reading frame was inserted into pET-HAX vector. The vector harbors the sequence that encodes a hemagglutinin (HA) tag. The sgk cDNA beginning with the initial Met was inserted into the NdeI site, and its N terminus was thus fused in frame to the HA tag. Milligram quantities of HA-tagged Sgk were expressed in HMS174 bacteria that had been transformed with the pET-HA-Sgk expression construct. After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cells were harvested and lysed in HEMGN (25 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.9) homogenization buffer; the lysate was size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the major Sgk band at 50 kDa was excised. The SDS-PAGE gel slice was then quick-frozen and homogenized. The gel particles were mixed with Freund's adjuvant, filtered, and inoculated into female New Zealand White rabbits. Serum was extracted from the immunized rabbits at standard intervals to monitor antibody titer (Babco, Richmond, CA). The final titer of the unfractionated serum was high enough to detect sgk at a 1:10,000 dilution on a Western blot of whole cell lysate from glucocorticoid-treated Con.hd6 cells not overexpressing Sgk. For the purification of anti-Sgk antibodies by affinity column chromatography, bacterially expressed His-tagged Sgk was coupled to a nickel column (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose) (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The anti-Sgk serum was repeatedly applied to the column, and the specifically bound anti-Sgk antibodies were eluted with 50 mm glycine, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.3 into 1m Tris, pH 9.0, for neutralization and dialyzed against HEMGN. The purified antibodies were tested by Western blot analysis and shown to recognize multiple forms of sgk that migrated between 50 and 52 kDa. Soluble whole cell extracts (20–50 μg of protein) were electrophoretically resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to Nitran Plus membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was probed with a 1:5000 dilution of polyclonal anti-Sgk antibody in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 0,05% Tween 20 with 1% nonfat dry milk. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Bio-Rad) and was used at a dilution of 1:1,000. The Western blot was developed by using the Renaissance developing kit (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to x-ray film. Cells ectopically expressing His-tagged Sgk were harvested in HEMGN buffer containing 10 mm imidazole and the lysate incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The manufacturer's recommendations were followed to affinity purify His-tagged Sgk. The beads were equilibrated in 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin and incubated in the presence and absence of 100 μg/ml potato acid phosphatase (Sigma) for 30 min at 30 °C. Final beads were washed once and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with polyclonal anti-Sgk antibodies. Con8.dh6 cells were cultured on 8-well Lab-Tek Permanox slides (Nalgene Nunc International, Naperville, IL) or on sterile cover slides and grown to 30% confluency before the indicated combinations of serum and/or dexamethasone were added for the indicated time frame. Cell confluency prior to fixation did not exceed 60%. For indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 15 min in 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, rinsed with PBS, and permeabilized with 50% methanol, 50% acetone for 1 min. Following a rinse in PBS, the cells were preabsorbed for 5 min in PBS containing 4% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Cells were incubated with a 1:300 dilution of affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-Sgk antibody for 1–2 h at 25 °C. After 5 washes with PBS, the cells were treated for 5 min with PBS containing 4% normal goat serum. The cells were incubated with a 1:300 dilution of anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Cappel Research Products, Durham, NC) in PBS and then incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Cells were washed 5 times with PBS and mounted with 50% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 4 mg/mln-propyl gallate, and examined on a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using Adobe Photoshop 3.0.5 (Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and a Sony DKC-5000 digital camera. Nonspecific fluorescence was determined by incubation with the secondary antibody alone and shown to be negligible. Due to the use of an affinity purified antibody, preimmune serum showed a relatively higher background and was not used as a negative control. Double labeling for Sgk localization and the incorporation of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) utilized the above procedures with the following modifications. During the final hour of incubation in medium containing the indicated combinations of serum and/or dexamethasone, the cells were incubated in medium containing a final concentration of 100 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. Following fixation, the cells were rinsed with PBS, and the DNA was denatured by incubation in 0.12 n HCl at 37 °C for 1 h. After neutralization in two changes of 0.1 m borate buffer over 10 min, cells were washed 3 times for 30 min and then incubated in PBS containing 4% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch). In addition to the Sgk antibody incubation detailed above, the cells were also incubated with a 1:80 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) in PBS for 60 min at 25 °C. After the washes, secondary antibodies were added as described above with the addition of a 1:300 dilution of anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Con8.hd6 cells were cultured in 6-cm plates, not exceeding 35% confluency. The cells were washed twice with PBS and suspended in 500 μl of propidium iodide solution (75 μmpropidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100). Finally, cells were filtered through a polyacrylamide mesh and maintained on ice until use. Nuclear-emitted fluorescence was measured with a Coulter Elite instrument with laser output adjusted to deliver 15 milliwatts at 488 nm. Cell nuclei (104) were analyzed from each sample at a rate of 300–500 nuclei/s. The percentages of cells within the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were determined by analysis with the Multicycle computer program provided by Phoenix Flow Systems in the Cancer Research Laboratory Microchemical Facility of the University of California, Berkeley. The data were collected and analyzed with a Becton Dickinson FACScan and Lysis II software (Becton Dickinon). The cells were analyzed on a laser scanning cytometer (CompuCyte Corp., Cambridge MA) using argon ion laser excitation at 488 nm. Fluorescence was collected by photomultiplier tubes with green (530 DF 30) and red (600 DF 60) band pass filters, digitized to 0.25 μm by 0.5-μm pixel resolution, and temporarily stored as computer memory images. When complete memory images were obtained, they were segmented into nuclei using image processing techniques, and 20 features were calculated for each cell, including the total DNA content, and amount of green fluorescence, and stored in a list mode computer data file. Green fluorescence was calculated twice, once for the region containing the cell nucleus and second for a torus extending out from the nucleus to sample the cytoplasm of the cell. By plotting these features in two parameter dot plots, it was possible to define regions around clusters of cells with nuclear fluorescence, and regions around cells with cytoplasmic fluorescence, and color gate cells from these regions onto one-parameter DNA histograms. Cells from the specific regions were also relocated and visualized by epifluorescence illumination. The scanning is done in an automated fashion, with 5,000–10,000 cells analyzed per sample. The pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with the full-length sgk cDNA was utilized for the ectopic expression of Sgk in cell culture. Standard PCR techniques were used starting with the full-length wild type rat sgk cDNA (22Webster M.K. Goya L. Ge Y. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The final expression vector contains an Asp-718/XbaI insert which consists of the full cDNA of sgk fused in frame to a poly-8-His tag at the C terminus. To generate this chimeric construct with the full-length sgk gene in frame with the poly-His tag and with compatible restriction sites for the cloning sites of the vector, the two PCR primers used were 5′–AGGTACCGCCACCATGACCGTCAAAACCGAGGCTG–3′, which contains an Asp-718 site and the first codons of the sgk sequence, and 5′–TTCTAGATCAATGATGATGATGATGATGATGATGGAGGAAGGAGTCCATAGGAGGG–3′, which contains the XbaI site, the Stop-codon, eight His-residues, and the final amino"

The present study underlines the importance of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in the expression of iNOS in C6 glial cells and rat primary astrocytes. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was unable to induce the expression of iNOS and the production of NO in rat C6 glial cells. Similarly, wortmannin and LY294002, compounds that inhibit PI 3-kinase, were also unable to induce the expression of iNOS and the production of NO. However, a combination of wortmannin or LY294002 with LPS or IL-1β induced the expression of iNOS and the production of NO in C6 glial cells. Consistent with the induction of iNOS, wortmannin also induced iNOS promoter-derived chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in LPS- or IL-1β-treated C6 glial cells. The expression of iNOS by LPS in C6 glial cells expressing a dominant-negative mutant of p85α, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, further supports the conclusion that inhibition of PI 3-kinase provides a necessary signal for the induction of iNOS. Next we examined the effect of wortmannin on the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and nuclear factor NF-κB in LPS- or IL-1β-stimulated C6 glial cells. In contrast to the inability of LPS and IL-1β alone to induce the expression of iNOS, both LPS and IL-1β individually stimulated MAP kinase activity and induced DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Wortmannin alone was unable to activate MAP kinase and NF-κB. Moreover, wortmannin had no effect on LPS- or IL-1β-mediated activation of MAP kinase and NF-κB, suggesting that wortmannin induced the expression of iNOS in LPS- or IL-1β-stimulated C6 glial cells without modulating the activation of MAP kinase and NF-κB. Similar to C6 glial cells, wortmannin also stimulated LPS-mediated expression of iNOS and production of NO in astrocytes without affecting the LPS-mediated activation of NF-κB. Taken together, the results from specific chemical inhibitors and dominant-negative mutant expression studies demonstrate that apart from the activation of NF-κB, inhibition of PI 3-kinase is also necessary for the expression of iNOS and production of NO.

The NOS are basically divided into two forms. One constitutive form present in neurons (nNOS) and endothelial cells (eNOS) is a calcium-dependent enzyme, and the inducible form (iNOS) present in macrophages and astrocytes is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to stimuli (e.g. cytokine/lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) and does not require calcium for its activity (1Jaffrey S.R.

Although the NO produced by iNOS accounts for the bactericidal and tumoricidal properties of macrophages, it is also of particular importance in the pathophysiologies of inflammatory neurological diseases including demyelinating disorders (e.g. multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalopathy, X-adrenoleukodystrophy) and in ischemia and traumatic injuries associated with infiltrating macrophages and the production of proinflammatory cytokines (3Mitrovic B.

It is now increasingly clear that glial cells in the central nervous system also produce NO in response to the induction of iNOS by bacterial LPS and a series of cytokines including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Astrocytes in the healthy brain do not express iNOS; however, after ischemic, traumatic, neurotoxic, or inflammatory damage the reactive astrocytes express iNOS in the mouse, rat, and human (9Hu S.X.

Recently we have also observed that PD98059, an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK), the kinase responsible for the activation of MAP kinase, inhibits the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and the induction of iNOS in astrocytes, suggesting the possible involvement of the MAP kinase pathway in the LPS- and proinflammatory cytokine-mediated induction of iNOS (18Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that any alteration of the Ras-Raf-MEK-MAP kinase signal transduction pathway alters the activation of NF-κB and so the induction of iNOS in astrocytes and C6 glial cells. In this paper we present evidence that the signal mediated by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) induces/stimulates the expression of iNOS in LPS- or cytokine-stimulated C6 glial cells and rat primary astrocytes and that the signal is not mediated via MAP kinase and NF-κB. Specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (wortmannin and LY294002) and expression of the dominant-negative mutant of p85α, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, induced the expression of iNOS in LPS- or cytokine-stimulated C6 glial cells or stimulated the expression of iNOS in rat primary astrocytes without modulating the LPS- or cytokine-mediated activation of MAP kinase and NF-κB, suggesting that apart from the activation of NF-κB by LPS or cytokines, the inhibition of PI 3-kinase also provides an essential signal for the expression of iNOS and production of NO in C6 glial cells and astrocytes. Recombinant rat IFN-γ, DMEM/F-12, fetal bovine serum, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and NF-κB DNA-binding protein detection kit were from Life Technologies, Inc. Human IL-1β was from Genzyme. LPS (Escherichia coli) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate were purchased from Sigma. Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine were purchased from Matreya Inc. Wortmannin, LY294002, and antibodies against the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (p85α) were obtained from Calbiochem. Antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS were obtained from Transduction Laboratories, [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Astrocytes were prepared from rat cerebral tissue as described by McCarthy and DeVellis (19McCarthy K. DeVellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 10 days of culture astrocytes were separated from microglia and oligodendrocytes by shaking for 24 h in an orbital shaker at 240 rpm. The shaking was repeated twice more after a gap of 1 or 2 weeks before subculturing to ensure the complete removal of all of the oligodendrocytes and microglia. Cells were trypsin treated, subcultured, and stimulated with LPS or different cytokines in serum-free DMEM/F-12. C6glial cells obtained from ATCC were also maintained and induced with different stimuli as above. Synthesis of NO was determined by an assay of the culture supernatant for nitrite, a stable reaction product of NO with molecular oxygen. Briefly, 400 μl of culture supernatant was allowed to react with 200 μl of Griess reagent (20Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S. Berquist H. Wang H. Reis D.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The optical density of the assay samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. Fresh culture media served as the blank in all experiments. Nitrite concentrations were calculated from a standard curve derived from the reaction of NaNO2 in the assay. After a 24-h incubation in the presence or absence of different stimuli, cells were scraped off, washed with Hanks' buffer, and homogenized in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the iNOS band was visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS and 125I-labeled protein A (11Pahan K.

Cells were taken out of the culture dishes directly by adding Ultraspec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories Inc.), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot analyses, 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrotransferred to Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized at 68 °C with 32P-labeled cDNA probe using Express Hyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) as described by the manufacturer. The cDNA probe was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification using two primers (forward primer: 5′-CTC CTT CAA AGA GGC AAA AAT A-3′; reverse primer: 5′-CAC TTC CTC CAG GAT GTT GT-3′) (11Pahan K.

After hybridization, the filters were washed two or three times in solution I (2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS) for 1 h at room temperature followed by solution II (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C for another hour. The membranes were then dried and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak). The same filters were stripped and rehybridized with probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The relative mRNA content for iNOS (iNOS/GAPDH) was measured after scanning the bands with a Bio-Rad (model GS-670) imaging densitometer. The CAT under the control of the iNOS promoter was created by subcloning a 1.5-kilobase promoter from pGEM-NOS at the SphI and SalI restriction sites of pCAT-basic vector (Promega). The full-length promoter (22Eberhardt W. Kunz D. Hummel R. Pfeilschifler J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was amplified by using two primers (forward: 5′-GAG AGT GTG CAA GTA TTT GTA GGA G-3′ and reverse: 5′-AAG GTG GCT GAG AAG TTT CA-3′) from rat genomic DNA and cloned in pGEM-T vector (Promega) to produce pGEM-NOS. The clone was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of reporter plasmid by using the Lipotaxi (Stratagene) method, as has been described in manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with different stimuli for 14 h and harvested. The radioisotopic method was used to assay CAT activity using a kit (Promega) as described by manufacturer's protocol. In the dominant-negative form of p85α, 35 amino acids in the inter-SH2 region from residues 479–513 of wild type p85α, important for binding the p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase, are deleted, and two other amino acids (Ser-Arg) are inserted in this deleted position. The engineering of the construct and description of the vector driving the expression of the proteins have been published previously (23Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson R. Hawkin P.T. Dhand R. Clark A.E. Holman G.D. Waterfied M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). C6 glial cells were transfected with either the dominant-negative form of p85α or an empty vector by Lipotaxi following manufacturer's protocol. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with different stimuli. After stimulation in serum-free DMEM/F-12 cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm iodoacetamide, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl chloride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. Lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 1 μg/ml p85α monoclonal antibody. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, protein G-Sepharose beads were added, and the resulting mixture was further incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, once with phosphate-buffered saline, once with 0.5 m LiCl and 100 mm Tris (pH 7.6), once in water, and once in kinase buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)). PI 3-kinase activity was determined as described (24Ward S.G. Reif K. Ley S. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23862-23869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a lipid mixture of 100 μl of 0.1 mg/ml PI and 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine dispersed by sonication in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) and 1 mm EDTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and 100 μm ATP and terminated after 15 min by the addition of 80 μl of 1n HCl and 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). Phospholipids were separated by TLC and visualized by exposure to iodine vapor and autoradiography (24Ward S.G. Reif K. Ley S. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23862-23869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed directly with 2 × SDS sample buffer, and the lysates were boiled, electrophoresed in 4–20% gradient gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with phospho-specific MAP kinase antibody (New England Biolabs). Phospho-specific p44/42 MAP kinase antibody detects p42 and p44 MAP kinase (Erk1 and Erk2) only when activated by phosphorylation at Tyr-204. Nuclear extracts from stimulated or unstimulated astrocytes (1 × 107 cells) were prepared using the method of Dignam et al. (25Dignam D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min on ice, vortexed vigorously for 15 s, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 40 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 mNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After 30 min on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were diluted with 20 μl of modified buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05 mKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and stored at −70 °C until use. Nuclear extracts were used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the NF-κB DNA-binding protein detection system kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To assay the transcriptional activity of NF-κB, cells were transfected with pNF-κB-Luc, an NF-κB-dependent reporter construct (obtained from Stratagene), using the Lipotaxi method. 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with different stimuli for 4 h. Total cell extracts were used to measure luciferase activity in a scintillation counter (Beckman LS 3801) (26Nguyen V.T. Morange M. Bensaude O. Anal.

The cytotoxic effects of all of the inhibitors were determined by measuring the metabolic activity of cells with the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. We investigated the effect of specific inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (wortmannin and LY294002) on the induction of iNOS and production of NO in C6 glial cells. C6glial cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM/F-12 in the presence of LPS and inhibitors of PI 3-kinase. Consistent with previous observations (12Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1896-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), the bacterial LPS or cytokines alone did not induce the production of NO in C6 glial cells (Table I). Wortmannin and LY294002 alone were also unable to induce the production of NO; however, addition of these inhibitors along with LPS induced the production of NO as nitrite by about 8–10-fold (Table I). Inhibition of this NO production by arginase, an enzyme that degrades the substrate (l-arginine) of NOS, and l-NMA, a competitive inhibitor of NOS activity, suggests that wortmannin- or LY294002-induced NO production in LPS-stimulated C6 glial cells is dependent on NOS-mediated arginine metabolism (Table I). To understand the mechanism of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor-induced production of NO in LPS-treated C6 glial cells, we examined the effect of these inhibitors on the protein and mRNA level of iNOS. Fig. 1 shows that wortmannin dose-dependently induced the production of NO (Fig. 1A) and the expression of iNOS protein (Fig. 1B) in LPS-treated C6 glial cells. The lowest dose of wortmannin found to induce the production of NO and the expression of iNOS protein was 50 nm. At 300 nm, the production of NO and the expression of iNOS protein were found to be maximum (Fig. 1). Similar to the effect of wortmannin in LPS-treated C6 glial cells, wortmannin also induced the production of NO in IL-1β-treated C6 cells (Fig. 2A). However, wortmannin was unable to induce the production of NO in IFN-γ-treated cells. Consistent with the effect of wortmannin on the production of NO, wortmannin was also able to induce the expression of iNOS protein (Fig. 2B) and mRNA (Fig. 2C) in LPS- or IL-1β-treated cells. Although LPS, IL-1β, and IFN-γ individually were unable to induce the expression of iNOS and the production of NO, different combinations of these stimuli (e.g. LPS + IL-1β; LPS + IFN-γ) induced the production of NO (Fig. 2A) and the expression of iNOS protein (Fig. 2B) and mRNA (Fig. 2C). To understand the effect of wortmannin on the transcription of the iNOS gene, C6 cells were transfected with a construct containing the iNOS promoter fused to the CAT gene. Activation of this promoter was measured after stimulating the cells with LPS or cytokines in the presence or absence of wortmannin. Consistent with the effect of wortmannin on the production of NO and the expression of endogenous iNOS, wortmannin itself had no effect on CAT activity, but it induced the CAT activity in LPS- or IL-1β-treated C6 cells (Fig. 2D). Again, wortmannin was unable to induce the CAT activity in IFN-γ-treated cells. These results indicate that inhibition of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin is able to provide a necessary signal for the transcription of the iNOS gene in LPS- or IL-1β-stimulated C6cells.Table IEffect of inhibitors of PI 3-kinase phosphatases on LPS-induced production of NO in C6 glial cellsStimuliNitritenmol/mg/24 hControl3.4 ± 0.3LPS only3.7 ± 0.4Wort only3.5 ± 0.35LY29 only3.3 ± 0.25LPS + Wort32.6 ± 3.6LPS + LY2930.2 ± 2.8LPS + Wort + l-NMA5.1 ± 0.6LPS + LY29 + l-NMA4.9 ± 0.5LPS + Wort + arginase5.8 ± 0.4LPS + LY29 + arginase5.2 ± 0.7C6 glial cells preincubated in serum-free DMEM/F-12 for 30 min with l-NMA or arginase received LPS and/or wortmannin (Wort) and LY294002 (LY29).

The isolated IP3 receptor protein was phosphorylated by both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases on two distinct sites as determined by thermolytic phosphopeptide mapping, phosphopeptide 1, representing Ser-1589, and phosphopeptide 2, representing Ser-1756 in the rat protein (Ferris, C. D., Cameron, A. M., Bredt, D. S., Huganir, R. L., and Snyder, S. H. (1991) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 175, 192–198). Phosphopeptide maps show that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) labeled both sites with the same time course and same stoichiometry, whereas cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) phosphorylated Ser-1756 with a higher velocity and a higher stoichiometry than Ser-1589. Synthetic decapeptides corresponding to the two phosphorylation sites (peptide 1, AARRDSVLAA (Ser-1589), and peptide 2, SGRRESLTSF (Ser-1756)) were used to determine kinetic constants for the phosphorylation by PKG and PKA, and the catalytic efficiencies were in agreement with the results obtained by in vitro phosphorylation of the intact protein. In cerebellar slices prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate, activation of endogenous kinases by incubation in the presence of cAMP/cGMP analogues and specific inhibitors of PKG and PKA induced in both cases a 3-fold increase in phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor. Thermolytic phosphopeptide mapping of in situ labeled IP3 receptor by PKA showed labeling on the same sites (Ser-1589 and Ser-1756) as in vitro. In contrast to the findings in vitro, PKG preferentially phosphorylated Ser-1589 in situ. Because both PKG and the IP3receptor are specifically enriched in cerebellar Purkinje cells, PKG may be an important IP3 receptor regulator in vivo.

IP3 receptors derive from at least three different genes, constituting types I, II, and III, which are approximately 70% identical at the amino acid level but differ in distribution and regulation (reviewed in Refs. 1Berridge M.J.

An assembly of four 260-kDa subunits forms the receptor. Each subunit consists of a cytoplasmic, amino-terminal IP3 binding domain, a coupling domain, and a Ca2+ channel pore of six transmembrane segments (2Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. Miyawaki A. Semin.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Type I is further diversified by alternative RNA splicing, resulting in two main forms, of which the longest (SII+, containing the 40 amino acid residues 1693–1732) is specifically expressed in neurons (2Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. Miyawaki A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One or more IP3receptor forms have been found in virtually all cell types examined (reviewed in Ref. 2Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. Miyawaki A. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but particularly high amounts of type I IP3 receptor are seen in smooth muscle cells and in cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Calcium release mediated by IP3 receptors appears to be an essential step for the induction of long term depression (LTD) in Purkinje cells (5Inoue T. Kato K. Kohda K. Mikoshiba K. J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6865-6871Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) support these observations.Phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor by PKA and PKG represents a possible mechanism for cross-talk whereby cyclic nucleotides can modulate IP3-mediated regulation of Ca2+ levels (20Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21933-21938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 31Burgess G.M. Bird G. St J. Obie J.F. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4772-4781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because cAMP and cGMP levels in most cells are regulated by various extracellular signals, identification of phosphorylation sites labeled by these kinases is of interest. Amino acid sequencing indicated that PKA phosphorylates the rat neuronal receptor on Ser-1756 and, less efficiently, on Ser-1589 (9Ferris C.D. Cameron A.M. Bredt D.S. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similarly, PKG appears to phosphorylate mainly Ser-1756 in vitro (19Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the smooth muscle IP3 receptor is preferentially phosphorylated by PKA on Ser-1589 in vitro(10Danoff S.K. Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G.A. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2951-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), whereas Ser-1756 is more prominently phosphorylated by PKA in kidney cells in vivo (11Sharma K. Wang L. Zhu Y. Bokkala S. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14617-14623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hence, the preferred substrate sites for PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor differ according to receptor isoforms and tissues, and the factors determining these responses remain unclear. Moreover, IP3receptor phosphorylation by PKG in neuronal cells has not been characterized in detail.In the present study, we have examined in vitrophosphorylation catalyzed by the cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases both of the immunoisolated cerebellar IP3 receptor and of synthetic peptides corresponding to the phosphorylation sites. We have further characterized the in situ phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor in cerebellar slices stimulated with cyclic nucleotide analogues. The results confirm earlier reports stating that the cerebellar IP3 receptor can be efficiently phosphorylated by PKA and PKG on two distinct sites in vitro. In addition, we show that both PKA and PKG can phosphorylate the cerebellar IP3 receptor in situ on the same two sites, albeit with distinct time courses and kinetics.Some of these data have been reported in abstract form (21Haug L.S. Walaas S.I. Østvold A.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63 Suppl. 1 (abstr.): S87DGoogle Scholar,32Haug L.S. Jensen V. Hvalby Ø. Walaas S.I. Østvold A.C. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71 (suppl.) (abstr.): S61BGoogle Scholar).DISCUSSIONPhosphorylation of the IP3 receptor has been observed in different cell types, involving different signaling systems and protein kinases. In the present work, we show that both PKA and PKG mediate in vitro phosphorylation of at least two sites in the neuronal IP3 receptor immunopurified from rat cerebellum. When the intact neuronal IP3 receptor is phosphorylated in vitro, low concentrations of PKA label Ser-1756, whereas high levels of PKA label both Ser-1756 and Ser-1589 (9Ferris C.D. Cameron A.M. Bredt D.S. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation by PKG appears to mimic the effect of low PKA, because a strong preference for Ser-1756 is observed (20Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21933-21938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In contrast, the smooth muscle IP3 receptor is phosphorylated by PKA in vitro only on Ser-1589 (10Danoff S.K. Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G.A. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2951-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The smooth muscle G0 protein, later reported to represent an IP3 receptor (23Koga T. Yoshida Y. Cai J.Q. Islam M.O. Imai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11640-11647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is preferentially phosphorylated by endogenous PKG in vitro on a phosphopeptide comigrating on phosphopeptide maps with the IP3 receptor phosphopeptide containing Ser-1589 (25Parks T.P. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Jamieson J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 255: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A proposed cause for the differential phosphorylation between neuronal and smooth muscle IP3receptors is the 40-amino acid stretch comprising the alternatively spliced residues 1693–1732, which are not found in the nonneuronal IP3 receptor subtype from smooth muscle (SII−).Under the experimental conditions used in this work, we have found that the two phosphorylation sites showed distinct kinetic features when their in vitro phosphorylation was studied by the use of synthetic peptide substrates. Phosphorylation of synthetic decapeptides containing the putative phosphorylation sites for PKA and PKG showed that both enzymes display higher values for Vmaxand Kcat for the Ser-1589-containing peptide 1 than for the Ser-1756-containing peptide 2 (Table I). Despite the lower maximal rate of phosphorylation, PKG had approximately 4-fold higher affinity for peptide 2 than peptide 1, whereas PKA exhibited 1.5-fold higher affinity for peptide 2 compared with peptide 1. Hence, the catalytic efficiency (Kcat/K m) of PKG was higher for peptide 2, indicating a preference for Ser-1756 by this kinase (Table I), which is in agreement with earlier results (19Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the differences in catalytic efficiency were small, and both IP3 receptor-derived peptides appeared to be phosphorylated by the two kinases with a higher catalytic efficiency than D32-((Ser-34)8–38) (Table I). The latter peptide represents the phosphorylation domain of DARPP-32, a protein that is a substrate for both PKA (35Walaas S.I. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1983; 3: 291-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and PKG (45Tsou K. Snyder G.L. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3462-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) in situ. Thus, from these data we cannot exclude any of these IP3 receptor peptides as possible targets for cyclic nucleotide-activated protein kinasesin vivo.Our in situ data appear to contradict the report from Komalavilas and Lincoln (19Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8701-8707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which Ser-1589 was proposed not to represent a physiological substrate site for PKG. Our experiments employing [32P]orthophosphate-incorporated cerebellar slices, which were stimulated with a highly specific cGMP analogue, showed that the IP3 receptor was phosphorylated mostly on Ser-1589 in situ (Fig. 5), whereas a cAMP analogue mainly produced the Ser-1756 phosphopeptide. This difference in the phosphorylation pattern, which apparently is not caused by distinct IP3 receptor subtypes, may be due to the properties of the protein kinases and their localization in the Purkinje cells (46Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Miller P.E. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These results emphasize the care needed when extrapolation fromin vitro experiments is used to identify physiologically important processes.Further evidence for in situ phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor in Purkinje cells came from back-phosphorylation experiments. Following both cAMP and cGMP analogue stimulation, such experiments decreased the subsequent in vitro phosphorylation induced by PKA by 25%. Because the IP3 receptor was extracted and isolated in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, these results indicate that the various treatments had decreased the amount of dephospho-IP3receptor. Hence, although phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions are rapid and dynamic processes, and the stimulation with cyclic nucleotide analogues took place without phosphatase inhibitors present, these results demonstrate notable changes in IP3 receptor phosphorylation caused by in situ stimulation.Recent work has provided increasing knowledge about the functional consequences of IP3 receptor phosphorylation. Cyclic nucleotides mediate regulation of intracellular Ca2+levels, e.g. by phosphorylation of Ca2+channels, Ca2+ transporters, and regulatory proteins (47Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K.R. Strumwasser F.

Rhee S.K. Hamanaka H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6735-6742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased Ca2+ flux is seen when IP3 receptor is phosphorylated by PKA in permeabilized SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (12Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Luo S.G. J. Biol.

Ondriasová E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Multiple mechanisms may also mediate the effects of cGMP on intracellular Ca2+ (54Cornwell T.L. Pryzwanski K.B. Wyatt T.A. Lincoln T.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 923-931PubMed Google Scholar), including cGMP-mediated regulation of smooth muscle plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (23Koga T. Yoshida Y.

Chiesi M. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9753-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The consequences of PKG-phosphorylation of the IP3receptor are not well defined, although in rat and guinea pig hepatocytes, cGMP potentiates Ca2+ release and induces oscillations (26Guihard G.

Walaas S.I. Greengard P. Synapse. 1988; 2: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 46Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Miller P.E. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The effect of conjunction of parallel fiber activation and climbing fiber-induced depolarization in Purkinje cells is a long lasting synaptic depression (LTD). Recent studies have proposed that climbing fiber activity may induce calcium release from intracellular stores via IP3 receptors, which in turn may sensitize IP3 receptors to the IP3released as a consequence of parallel fiber activation (56Khodakhah K. Armstrong C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14009-14014Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 57Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 388-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Induction of LTD is prevented by a specific, blocking antibody to the IP3 receptor, and LTD fails to develop in mice with a disrupted IP3 receptor type I gene (5Inoue T. Kato K. Kohda K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5366-5373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One underlying molecular mechanism whereby climbing fiber-induced nitric oxide release (58Shibuki K. Okada D. Nature. 1991; 349: 326-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), the resulting generation of cGMP, and the activation of PKG may regulate LTD in these synapses is the phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor. Activation of intracellular signal transduction cascades frequently involves increased phosphoinositide hydrolysis following stimulation of phospholipase C.

Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar). IP3 receptors derive from at least three different genes, constituting types I, II, and III, which are approximately 70% identical at the amino acid level but differ in distribution and regulation (reviewed in Refs. 1Berridge M.J.

An assembly of four 260-kDa subunits forms the receptor.

The most striking characteristic of PHFs upon Western blotting is their smearing. According to a previously described protocol (Morishima-Kawashima, M., Hasegawa, M., Takio, K., Suzuki, M., Titani, K., and Ihara, Y. (1993) Neuron10, 1151–1160), smeared tau was purified, and its peptide map was compared with that of soluble (normal) tau. A CNBr fragment from soluble tau (CN5; residues 251–419 according to the 441-residue isoform) containing the microtubule-binding domain migrated at 15 and 18 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas that from smeared tau exhibited two larger, unusually broad bands at ∼30 and ∼45 kDa, presumably representing dimers and trimers of CN5. In the peptide map of smeared tau-derived CN5, distinct peaks eluting at unusual locations were noted. Amino acid sequence and mass spectrometric analyses revealed that these distinct peptides bear isoaspartate at Asn-381 and Asp-387. Because no unusual peptides other than aspartyl or isoaspartyl peptide were found in the digests of smeared tau-derived CN5, it is likely that site-specific deamidation and isoaspartate formation are involved in its dimerization and trimerization and thus in PHF formation in vivo.

Amino acid sequence and mass spectrometric analyses revealed that these distinct peptides bear isoaspartate at Asn-381 and Asp-387. Because no unusual peptides other than aspartyl or isoaspartyl peptide were found in the digests of smeared tau-derived CN5, it is likely that site-specific deamidation and isoaspartate formation are involved in its dimerization and trimerization and thus in PHF formation in vivo. One of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer's disease; API, Achromobacter lyticus protease I; CNBr, cyanogen bromide; NFT, neurofibrillary tangle; PHF, paired helical filament; RP, reverse phase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; SDS-PAGE, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TFA, trifluoroacetic acid is the formation of innumerable neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) throughout the cortex. NFTs were originally found by silver staining as intracytoplasmic fibrous structures surrounding neuronal nuclei and running into the proximal portion of apical dendrites, thus often providing an image of a flame (flame-shaped tangle) (1Alzheimer A. Allg. Z. Psychiatr. 1907; 64: 146-148Google Scholar). Smaller NFTs are also formed in dendrites and senile plaque neurites. Dendritic NFTs largely represent curly fibers (neuropil threads), and their remarkable abundance in the AD brain has been uncovered by specific immunostaining (2Braak H. Braak E. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Neurosci. Lett. 1986; 65: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 3Ihara Y. Brain Res. 1988; 459: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The unit fibrils of NFTs are called paired helical filaments (PHFs), which are 20 nm in diameter and constrict to 10 nm at a periodicity of 80 nm. This unusual morphology allows us to readily distinguish PHFs from normal neuronal cytoskeletons including microtubules and neurofilaments under an electron microscope. Because NFTs, especially curly fibers, are always dense in areas of neuronal loss, they have been considered to be closely related to neuronal death in AD (4Gomez-Isla T. Hollister R. West H. Mui S. Growdon J.H. Petersen R.C. Parisi J.E. Hyman B.T. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 41: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The neuronal loss, in turn, is closely correlated with the degree of dementia, the essential symptom for making the diagnosis of AD (4Gomez-Isla T. Hollister R. West H. Mui S. Growdon J.H. Petersen R.C. Parisi J.E. Hyman B.T. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 41: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The major components of PHFs are tau and ubiquitin (5Wischik C.M. Novak M. Thøgersen H.C. Edwards P.C. Runswick M.J. Jakes R. Walker J.E. Milstein C. Roth M. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4506-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 6Kondo J.

Science. 1987; 235: 1641-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), the former of which constructs the framework of PHFs (8Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 9Crowther R.A. Olesen O.F. Smith M.J. Jakes R. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The striking characteristics of tau in PHFs are insolubility and hyperphosphorylation. Thus far, the abnormal phosphorylation of PHF-tau (hyperphosphorylated full-length tau) has been intensively focussed upon, and the phosphorylation sites have been determined with immunochemical and protein chemical procedures (10Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hasegawa M. Watanabe A. Takio K. Suzuki M. Arai T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). However, it is now known that the microtubule-binding domain makes up the framework of PHFs (8Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), and that phosphorylation in the flanking regions is not required for the assembly of tau into PHFs in vitro (9Crowther R.A. Olesen O.F. Smith M.J. Jakes R. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of hyperphosphorylation of tau in PHF formation remains to be elucidated. Despite the presence of heparin or heparan sulfate (13Goedert M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) or RNA (14Kampers T. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), a stimulator for PHF assembly, the concentrations of tau required are too high to apply to the in vivo situation, and the formed filaments are easily disaggregated. Therefore, we believe that there should be other factors to promote and stabilize tau aggregation in vivo. We have been concerned about the smearing on the blot of the PHF-enriched fraction using PHFs or tau antibodies (15Ihara Y. Abraham C. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1983; 304: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The smear on the blot ranged from the gel top to ∼10 kDa, with the high molecular mass region showing the most intense immunoreactivity. This smear is not an artifact during electrophoresis but appears to represent a real molecular form because: (i) it is fractionated according to molecular size on gel filtration (16Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), (ii) a close inspection of the blot reveals that the smear in the low molecular mass region consists of very fine, closely spaced, discrete bands, and the minimal unit of reactive bands may migrate at 10–20 kDa, 2Y. Ihara, unpublished data. and (iii) the smear reacts strongly with tau antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal portion but does not react at all or reacts only faintly with antibodies to the amino-terminal portion. 3M. Morishima-Kawashima and Y. Ihara, unpublished data. Thus, the smear may be composed of carboxyl-terminal fragments that should have a strong tendency to aggregate into oligomers. This means that the analysis of the smear should provide us with an important insight into the assembly of tau into PHFs and their unusual stabilization in vivo. There are two kinds of smears: ubiquitin-positive smears and ubiquitin-negative smears (16Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This indicates that ubiquitination is not responsible for the smearing phenomena. In the present work, the ubiquitin-negative, smeared tau was subjected to protein chemical analysis. We show here that the major difference between the soluble and smeared forms of tau is the presence of structurally altered asparaginyl and aspartyl residues in the microtubule-binding domain of the latter. It is possible that isoaspartate formation at specific sites in the microtubule-binding domain of tau induces a profound conformational change by which the tau can self-assemble into PHFs and provides unusual stability in vivo. All reagents for peptide synthesis, namely, Fmoc-l-amino acids (SynProPep® Reagents SM8-Pack PB-Mix), Fmoc-d-Asp (OtBu)-OH, and MAPS resins (TAKO8-Cys-WTGS), were obtained from Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan). Fmoc-l-Asp-OtBu and Fmoc-l-Lys (Boc)-resin were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA), piperidine was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), and anisole, 1,2-ethanedithiol, N-methylmorpholine, and piperidine were obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Soluble (normal) tau was purified from normal control or AD brains according to the protocol described previously (6Kondo J. Honda T. Mori H. Hamada Y. Miura R. Ogawara M. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1988; 1: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Because the peptide maps of normal soluble tau and AD-soluble tau were indistinguishable from each other (10Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in the present study, we used AD-soluble tau to compare with smeared tau. PHF-tau and smeared tau were purified from Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets of AD brain homogenates, as described previously (10Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets were solubilized with 6 m guanidine-HCl, and the supernatants were carboxymethylated with iodoacetate after reduction with dithiothreitol. After gel filtration on a TSK gel G-3000SWXL column (7.8 × 300 mm × 2 (tandem); Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan), pooled fractions for PHF-tau or smeared tau eluting earlier than PHF-tau were further purified on an Aquapore RP300 column (2.1 × 30 mm; Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA) by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC; model 1090 M; Hewlett-Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) with a linear gradient of 20–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 10 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min (10Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Thus, the smear that has a molecular mass larger than that of PHF-tau was subjected to protein chemical analysis. By using this step, ubiquitin-negative, smeared tau was largely separated from ubiquitin-positive, smeared tau that eluted later (16Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Purified soluble tau, PHF-tau, and smeared tau were cleaved with CNBr, and the fragments generated were separated by HPLC on a Superspher Select B column (2.0 × 119 mm; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), which was developed with a linear gradient of 16–44% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The ubiquitin-negative CNBr fragment was further separated from the contaminating ubiquitin-positive fragment that eluted later from CN5 (see Fig. 2). The absence of ubiquitin was confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. The two CNBr fragments bearing many phosphates, CN2 (residues 128–250) and CN5 (251–419), were treated with alkaline phosphatase (Escherichia coli, type IIIR; Sigma). Dephosphorylated CN2 and CN5 were digested withAchromobacter lyticus protease I (API), as described previously (10Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The digests were separated by RP-HPLC on a Superspher Select B column with a linear gradient of 0–48% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA for 48 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The API peptide bearing the tau-1 portion (residues 191–225) from CN2 was further digested for 15 h at 37 °C with chymotrypsin (Cooper Biomedical) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). The digest was separated under the same conditions as described above. All of the separated peptides were subjected to protein sequencing and mass spectrometry (see below). Dephosphorylated CN5 was electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon; Nihon Millipore Ltd., Yonezawa, Japan) after SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, each broad band at ∼45 or ∼30 kDa was excised from the membrane and blocked with 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 in methanol for 30 min (17Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). After rinsing the membrane several times with distilled water, each band on the membrane was digested with API at a 1:50 enzyme:substrate ratio at 37 °C overnight. The digest was similarly separated as described above. Fractionated peptides were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 477A Protein Sequencer equipped with an on-line 120A PTH Analyzer or on an Applied Biosystems 473A Protein Sequencer, as described previously (10Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17047-17054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analysis was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry on REFLEX (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a delayed extraction or Voyager-DERP (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Samples were prepared by mixing α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. The samples were dried and hydrolyzed in a vapor of 6 n HCl containing 0.1% (w/v) phenol at 108 °C for 6 h, conditions under which most of the Asp residues are released from the peptide bond (18Brunauer L.S. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12538-12543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After drying in a vacuum centrifuge, the samples were dissolved in 10 μl of 100 mm borate buffer at pH 9.0 and incubated with 7.5 μl of acetonitrile and 2.5 μl of 18 mm (+)-1-(9 fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate (Eka Nobel AB) in acetone at room temperature for 25 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 100 mm cysteic acid dissolved in 100 mm borate buffer at pH 9.0. The sample solution was mixed with 14 μl of 9n acetic acid and 56 μl of sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.7), and then a 20-μl aliquot was subjected to RP-HPLC (LC-10AVP; Shimadzu) on a Superspher® 100 RP-18(e) column (4 μm; 4 mm × 24 cm; Merck) equilibrated with Buffer A (0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.22):acetonitrile:tetrahydrofuran (19:3:3, v/v) and 0.1 mm EDTA). Elution was conducted with a stepwise increase in the proportion of Buffer B (0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 4.75):acetonitrile:tetrahydrofuran (4:3:3, v/v) and 0.1 mmEDTA) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min (19Einarsson S. Josefsson B. Anal. Chem. 1987; 59: 1191-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 20Hayashi T. Sasagawa T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The processes of derivatization to analysis were automated for reproducible results. 4M. Chijimatsu, and K. Takio, unpublished data. Independent multiple samples were analyzed for each protein or fragment. Each synthetic peptide consisting of residues 386–395 (TDHGAEIVYK) with the second position being replaced by l-Asp, l-isoAsp, or d-Asp was synthesized by the solid-phase method withN αFmoc-amino acids on a PSSM-8 peptide synthesizer (Shimadzu) using the standard protocol (21Nokihara K. Yamamoto R. Hazama M. Wakizawa O. Nakamura S. Yamaguchi M. Suzuki A. Peptide Chemistry. Protein Research Foundation, Osaka, Japan1992: 203-208Google Scholar). After repeated washing with methanol and butyl methyl ether, the synthesized peptides were released from the resin, and side chain-protecting groups were removed by treatment with a cleavage mixture (94% TFA (v/v):5% anisole (v/v):1% 1,2-ethanedithiol (v/v)) at room temperature for 2 h. All of the peptides were purified by RP-HPLC on an Aquapore RP300 column and a Superspher Select B column (2.0 × 119 mm; Merck). The peptide T(isoD)HGAEIVY was synthesized on a branched lysine carrier core. An antiserum against the peptide was raised using the multiple antigen peptide method (22Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). A New Zealand White rabbit was immunized with 1 mg of multiple antigen peptide and boosted four to five times with 0.5 mg at 2-week intervals, starting 4 weeks after the first immunization. Titers of the antisera were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and dot blotting. The antibodies used were 5E2 (epitope, residues 214–233, according to the longest human tau isoform) (23Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Binder L. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Lee G.

Gerontology. 1990; 36 Suppl. 1: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed using the avidin-biotin method (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), as described previously (10Hasegawa M. Morishima-Kawashima M. Takio K.

The levels of soluble tau were significantly decreased in the AD brain as compared with the normal brain (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, tau was undetectable in the Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets of normal brain homogenates by the immunochemical procedure used (Fig. 1A), whereas the Sarkosyl-insoluble pellets of AD brain homogenates contained a large amount of tau; the tau in these pellets exhibited slowly migrating triplets (PHF-tau) and a smear on the blot (Fig. 1A). Whereas PHF-tau was immunoreactive with all of the antibodies (their epitopes spanned the whole tau molecule), the smear reacted to lesser extents with antibodies to the amino-terminal half of tau (Fig. 1A; see Fig. 5 for the locations of their epitopes).3Figure 5Amino acid sequence of the longest isoform of human tau.

The fractions eluting earlier than PHF-tau and those containing PHF-tau were pooled separately, and each pool was subjected to RP-HPLC (Fig. 1B). PHF-tau was recovered as a distinct peak (Fig. 1B, a), whereas the pool rich in high-mass smear provided very broad, rather indistinct peaks (Fig. 1B, b). An early-eluting peak represents ubiquitin-negative smeared tau, whereas a late-eluting peak represents ubiquitin-positive smeared tau (Ref. 16Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1151-1160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 2C). Thus, the smear we have characterized here represents only a part of smeared tau: the smear with molecular masses larger than that of PHF-tau. Purified soluble (normal) tau and smeared tau were cleaved with CNBr, and the generated fragments were separated on a RP column (Fig. 2A). Two large CNBr fragments, CN2 (residues 128–250) and CN5 (residues 251–419), emerged (see Fig. 5 for the sequence of tau) (6Kondo J. Honda T. Mori H. Hamada Y. Miura R. Ogawara M. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1988; 1: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). CN5 contains the microtubule-binding domain (residues 256–367), whereas CN2 contains the tau-1 portion (residues 191–225). The CN5 from smeared tau eluted slightly later and showed some tailing as compared with that from soluble tau (Fig. 2A). These two major fractions containing CN2 and CN5 were treated with alkaline phosphatase and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 2,B and C). The CN2 fragments from soluble tau and smeared tau were examined for their reactivities with anti-human tau, 5E2, tau-C4, or DF2 (Fig. 2B). The CN2 fragments from soluble and smeared tau on the blot showed a discrete band and a somewhat indistinct band with a minimally retarded mobility, respectively (Fig. 2B). CN5 from soluble tau (lane a in the tau-C4 blot) consisted of two discrete bands at ∼18 and ∼15 kDa (Fig. 2C). These are most likely derived from four-repeat and three-repeat tau, respectively. In contrast, CN5 from smeared tau showed two very broad, major bands at ∼45 and ∼30 kDa, in addition to the two aforementioned bands that were only faintly labeled. These broad bands were unusually stable and never converted to the bands at ∼18 kDa or ∼15 kDa by pretreatment with concentrated formic acid (26Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3667) Google Scholar) or neat trifluoroacetic acid (27Grayson S. Sequeira S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) (data not shown). As expected from the purification procedure, the two broad bands showed no immunoreactivity with DF2 (Fig. 2C). Thus, it is quite reasonable to speculate that the smearing on the blot of PHF-enriched fractions is largely due to alterations in the CN5 region containing the microtubule-binding domain. The presence of these larger molecular forms after CNBr cleavage may raise the possibility that some unknown modifications cause incomplete CNBr digestion of tau. In fact, a smear of broad bands above ∼40 kDa is detected in lane b in the 5E2 blot or the tau-C6 blot, respectively (Fig. 2C). However, it is most likely that these bands represent CN2 or CN8 (residues 420–441) attached with CN5 due to incomplete CNBr cleavage, respectively. The presence of the larger CN2-CN5 fragment is clearly indicated in lane a of the 5E2 blot (Fig. 2C).

In this study, we characterized the effects of the VLDLr on the internalization, catabolism, and function of the uPA receptor (uPAR) in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. When challenged with uPA·PAI-1 complex, MDA-MB-435 cells internalized uPAR; this process was inhibited by 80% when the activity of the VLDLr was neutralized with receptor-associated protein (RAP). To determine whether internalized uPAR is degraded, we studied the catabolism of [35S]methionine-labeled uPAR. In the absence of exogenous agents, the uPAR catabolism t½ was 8.2 h. uPA·PAI-1 complex accelerated uPAR catabolism (t½ to 1.8 h), while RAP inhibited uPAR catabolism in the presence (t½ of 7.8 h) and absence (t½ of 16.9 h) of uPA·PAI-1 complex, demonstrating a critical role for the VLDLr. When MCF-7 cells were cultured in RAP, cell surface uPAR levels increased gradually, reaching a new steady-state in 3 days. The amount of uPA which accumulated in the medium also increased. Culturing in RAP for 3 days increased MCF-7 cell motility by 2.2 ± 0.1-fold and by 4.4 ± 0.3-fold when 1.0 nm uPA was added. The effects of RAP on MCF-7 cell motility were entirely abrogated by an antibody which binds uPA and prevents uPA binding to uPAR. MCF-7 cells that were cultured in RAP demonstrated increased levels of activated mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, the MEK inhibitor, PD098059, decreased the motility of RAP-treated cells without affecting control cultures. These studies suggest a model in which the VLDLr regulates autocrine uPAR-initiated signaling and thereby regulates cellular motility.

For example, activated α2-macroglobulin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A bind only to LRP (16Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol.

Homozygous LRP deficiency is embryonic lethal (18Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). gp330/megalin-deficient mice survive gestation but die shortly thereafter due to abnormal lung development (19Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), whereas VLDLr-deficient mice survive but demonstrate decreased body weight, body mass index, and adipose tissue mass (20Frykman P.K. Brown M.S. Yamamoto T. Goldstein J.L. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These diverse phenotypes may reflect differences in the cells or tissues that express the various LDL receptor homologues. Alternatively, uncharacterized differences in receptor function may be involved. Our laboratory recently identified a possible role for LRP as a regulator of cellular motility (21Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We studied murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that are LRP-deficient and wild-type MEFs from the same mouse strain. These cells do not express the VLDLr or gp330/megalin (22Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When allowed to migrate into denuded areas of vitronectin-coated cell culture wells, the LRP-deficient MEFs migrated almost twice as rapidly as wild-type cells (21Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The increased motility of the LRP-deficient MEFs was at least partially explained by an increase in the level of cell surface uPAR and by an increase in the amount of uPA which accumulated in the conditioned medium of these cells (21Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In diverse systems, uPA binding to uPAR promotes cellular migration by localizing cell surface proteinase activity, initiating signal transduction, and/or by regulating cellular adhesion (reviewed in Refs. 23Andreasen P.A. Kjøller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar and 24Conese M. Blasi F. Bailliere's Clin. Heamatol. 1995; 8: 365-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Unlike LRP-deficient MEFs, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which are treated with RAP to deactivate LDL receptor homologues, demonstrate decreased motility (25Wijnberg M.J. Quax P.H.A. Nieuwenbroek N.M.E. Verheijen J.H. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when MEFs are treated with RAP, while the migration assay is underway, no change in motility is observed (21Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Although it was suggested that the uPA/uPAR system may be responsible for the changes in VSMC motility which accompany RAP treatment (25Wijnberg M.J. Quax P.H.A. Nieuwenbroek N.M.E. Verheijen J.H. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), experiments were not performed to address this possibility. Other LRP ligands also may be involved. For example, thrombospondin 1 has been shown to inhibit the motility of VSMCs but not fibroblasts (27Tolsma S.S. Stack M.S. Bouck N. Microvasc. Res. 1997; 54: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is also possible that RAP affects VSMCs differently than MEFs since VSMCs express VLDLr in addition to LRP (25Wijnberg M.J. Quax P.H.A. Nieuwenbroek N.M.E. Verheijen J.H. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 78: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Weaver A.M. Lysiak J.J. Gonias S.L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1841-1850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hypothesis that LRP regulates cellular motility by altering the activity of the uPA/uPAR system is supported by recent studies demonstrating a role for LRP in uPAR endocytosis. uPA·PAI-1 complex, which is bound to uPAR, still binds to LRP (29Nykjaer A. Kjøller L. Cohen R.L. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.A. Todd III, R.F. van Zonneveld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction not only results in the internalization of uPA·PAI-1 complex, but promotes uPAR internalization as well (30Conese M. Nykjær A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that uPA·PAI-1 complex bridges uPAR to LRP by forming a tetramolecular complex that undergoes endocytosis as an intact unit (18Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 31Nykjær A. Conese M. Christensen E.I. Olson D. Cremona O. Gliemann J. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Internalized uPAR recycles back to the cell surface (31Nykjær A. Conese M. Christensen E.I. Olson D. Cremona O. Gliemann J. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar); however, the efficiency of recycling remains unclear. If the efficiency is less than 100%, then LRP may promote uPAR degradation in lysosomes, explaining why LRP-deficient MEFs have increased levels of cell surface uPAR (21Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The goal of the present investigation was to characterize the role of the VLDLr in the regulation of cell surface uPAR expression and cellular motility. Our studies were performed using breast cancer cell lines which express VLDLr but do not express LRP or gp330/megalin. When the VLDLr was neutralized, by culturing these cells in the presence of RAP, the level of cell surface uPAR increased gradually, reaching a new steady-state. The increase in cell surface uPAR was explained by a decrease in the rate of uPAR catabolism. Neutralizing the VLDLr also increased cellular motility. The increase in motility was entirely counteracted by an antibody which binds endogenously produced uPA and prevents uPAR ligation. We have previously shown that uPA promotes MCF-7 cell motility by activating the MAP kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK2 (32Nguyen D.H.D. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In RAP-treated breast cancer cells, the levels of activated ERK1 and ERK2 were increased. Furthermore, the motility of RAP-treated cells was selectively inhibited by an antagonist of ERK-dependent signaling. These newly identified activities of the VLDLr indicate a potentially important role for this receptor as a regulator of cancer cell physiology. Single-chain uPA (scuPA), two-chain uPA (tcuPA), and a polyclonal antibody which specifically recognizes human uPAR were provided by Drs. Jack Henkin and Andrew Mazar (Abbott Laboratories). tcuPA was inactivated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate to form DIP-uPA, as described previously (32Nguyen D.H.D. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody specific for the amino-terminal fragment of human uPA was from American Diagnostica. This antibody prevents the binding of uPA to cell surface uPAR (33Chucholowski N. Schmitt M. Rettenberger P. Schüren E. Moniwa N. Goretzki L. Wilhelm O. Weidle U. Jänicke F. Graeff H. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 4: 95-102Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody 399R, which recognizes human uPAR, was also from American Diagnostica. PAI-1 was provided by Dr. Duane Day (Molecular Innovations). An expression construct encoding RAP as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was provided by Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). GST-RAP was expressed and purified as described previously (34Webb D.J. Hussaini I.M. Weaver A.M. Atkins T.L. Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Owens G.K. Gonias S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 714-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and used without further modification. GST does not interfere with the function of RAP and does not independently affect any of the activities of LDL receptor homologues (34Webb D.J. Hussaini I.M. Weaver A.M. Atkins T.L. Chu C.T.

In control experiments, purified endotoxin, at 10 ng/ml, did not affect MCF-7 cell motility or uPAR expression. Na125I and [35S]methionine were from Amersham. The specific MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD098059, was from Calbiochem. A polyclonal antibody which recognizes only active, phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 (p44/42) was provided by Dr. Michael Weber (University of Virginia).

These cells were cultured in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 cells were passaged at subconfluence with Cell Dissociation Buffer (Enzyme Free, Hank's based, Life Technologies, Inc.). MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 cells were solubilized in 50 mm HEPES, 0.5 mNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml E-64, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Equal amounts of cellular protein (50 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5% slabs and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), containing 5% milk for 12 h at 4 °C. Ligand blot analysis was performed to detect membrane-associated RAP-binding proteins. The membranes were incubated with 200 nm GST-RAP in TBS with 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% Tween 20, and 5% milk for 1 h at 25 °C. The membranes were then probed with GST-specific monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 25 °C, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). Secondary antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. VLDLr was detected by immunoblot analysis using similarly prepared nitrocellulose membranes and polyclonal anti-human VLDLr antibody (kindly provided by Drs. Keith McCrae and Mats Gåfvels). LRP heavy chain was detected with monoclonal antibody 8G1, provided by Dr. Dudley Strickland (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD). GST-RAP was radioiodinated, using Iodo-Beads (Pierce), to a specific activity of 1–2 μCi/μg. MCF-7 cells were washed with EBSS, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (EHB medium). 125I-GST-RAP (10 nm) was then added to the cultures. A 100-fold molar excess of nonradiolabeled GST-RAP was added to some cultures so that specific RAP degradation could be determined. The cells were allowed to incubate for various periods of time at 37 °C. Cellular degradation of 125I-GST-RAP was detected by measuring the increase in trichloroacetic acid soluble radioactivity in the medium. MCF-7 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of GST-RAP (200 nm) for up to 5 days. The medium and GST-RAP were replaced daily. Our analysis of RAP catabolism by MCF-7 cells demonstrated that the concentration of GST-RAP in the medium decreased by less than 1% in each 24-h culturing period. Specific binding of DIP-uPA to RAP-treated and control MCF-7 cells was compared. DIP-uPA was radioiodinated with Iodo-Beads to a specific activity of 2–4 μCi/μg. The cultures were washed three times and then incubated with 125I-DIP-uPA (0.15–10 nm) in EHB for 4 h at 4 °C. In this uPA concentration range, high affinity binding to uPAR is selectively detected and low affinity interactions, such as those that might occur with the VLDLr, do not contribute significantly (3Heegaard C.W. Simonsen A.C.W. Oka K. Kjøller L. Christensen A. Madsen B. Ellgaard L. Chan L. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol.

At the end of each binding experiment, the cultures were washed four times at 4 °C; cell associated radioactivity was recovered in 1 m NaOH and quantitated in a γ-counter. Cellular protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). To calculate the number of specific uPA-binding sites per cell, the average mass of the MCF-7 cell was determined. Suspended cells were counted using a hemocytometer or a Coulter counter (yielding equivalent results) and then extracted for protein determination. The mass was 0.94 ± 0.07 ng/cell (n = 5). MCF-7 cells were incubated for 24 h in RPMI, without serum, in the presence or absence of 0.1 μm GST-RAP. Conditioned medium (CM) was recovered and concentrated 30-fold using Centricon concentrators with 10-kDa exclusion filters (Amicon). To detect plasminogen activator, concentrated CM was diluted 1:10 into solutions that contained 1.0 μm [Glu1]plasminogen and 0.5 mmVal-Leu-Lys-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (VLK-AMC). Fluorescence emission at 460 nm (excitation at 380 nm) was monitored for 1 h at 25 °C. These tracings were converted using a first derivative function so that the resulting plots showed relative plasmin concentration against time. The absolute concentration of uPA in MCF-7 cell CM was determined by comparing the maximum velocity of plasminogen activation to a standard curve generated with different concentrations of purified tcuPA (0.1–10 nm). In control experiments, we determined that GST-RAP does not affect the kinetics of plasminogen activation or VLK-AMC hydrolysis. In additional control experiments, the selective uPA inhibitor, amiloride (1.0 mm) was used to demonstrate that uPA is the primary plasminogen activator in MCF-7 cell CM (39Vassalli J. Belin D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Due to amiloride fluorescence, these experiments were performed using the plasmin-specific chromogenic substrate, VLK-p-nitroanilide. MDA-MB-435 cells were chosen for these experiments since these cells have high levels of cell surface uPAR, compared with MCF-7 cells (Ref. 40Holst-Hansen C. Johannessen B. Hoyer-Hansen G. Romer J. Ellis V. Brunner N. Clin. & Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 297-307PubMed Google Scholar and our results). The MDA-MB-435 cells were treated with GST-RAP (1 μm) or vehicle for 15 min at 37 °C. uPA·PAI-1 complex (10 nm), which was pre-formed by reacting tcuPA with PAI-1 at a 1:1 molar ratio, or DIP-uPA (10 nm) was added to the medium and incubation was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 37 °C. The cultures were then placed on ice and washed 3 times with ice-cold EBSS, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. A mild acid wash was then performed to dissociate uPA·PAI-1 complex or DIP-uPA (21Weaver A.M.

The acid wash sequence was: 50 mm glycine-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 3.0, for 10 min; 0.5 m HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5; and then three washes with ice-cold EBSS, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Cell surface uPAR was quantitated by measuring specific binding of 125I-DIP-uPA (10 nm). MDA-MB-435 cells were cultured for 12 h in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then for 24 h in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with [35S]methionine (10 μCi/ml). The cultures were chased for 1 h with methionine-containing complete medium, washed, and incubated in fresh medium, in the presence or absence of uPA·PAI-1 complex (0.5 nm) and GST-RAP (200 nm). At various times, the cells were solubilized in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm N-octyl glucoside, 10 μg/ml E-64, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4. [35S]Methionine-labeled uPAR was recovered from equal amounts of each cell extract by immunoprecipitation with uPAR-specific antibody (42 μg/ml), in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin and 10 mm EDTA. Antibody-antigen complexes were isolated with Protein A-agarose (Sigma). In control experiments, glycoprotein CD44 was recovered from the same cell extracts by immunoprecipitation using an antibody from Endogen (41Telen M.J. Palker T.J. Haynes B.F. Blood. 1984; 64: 599-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. [35S]Methionine-labeled uPAR or CD44 was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Western blot analysis was performed to confirm the identity of the immunoprecipitated proteins. MCF-7 cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of 200 nm GST-RAP or vehicle. Activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was then determined as described previously (32Nguyen D.H.D. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was aspirated and replaced with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml sodium orthovanadate. The cells were extracted at 4 °C with 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.4 mg/ml sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mg/ml sodium fluoride, and 5 mg/ml dithiothreitol, pH 7.4. The extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12% slabs. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes which were probed with antibodies that detect only phosphorylated (active) ERK1 and ERK2 or total ERK1 and ERK2. Cellular migration was studied using tissue culture-treated 6.5-mm Transwell chambers with 8.0 μm pore membranes (Costar). The underside surface of each membrane was coated with 20% FBS or with 5 μg/ml purified vitronectin for 2 h at 37 °C. The vitronectin was purified as described previously (42Yatohgo T. Izumi M.

This study complements a previous investigation of the triad Asp122-Arg123-Tyr124 (Lu, Z-L., Curtis, C. A., Jones, P. G., Pavia, J., and Hulme, E. C. (1997) Mol. Pharmacol. 51, 234–241). The results demonstrate the α-helical secondary structure of the domain and suggest its orientation with respect to the other transmembrane domains. The C-terminal part of the helix appears to be largely buried within the receptor structure. On its surface, there is a patch of three residues, Val113, Leu116, and Ser120, which may form intramolecular contacts that help to stabilize the inactive ground state of the receptor. Mutagenic disruption of these increased agonist affinity and signaling efficacy. In two cases (L116A and S120A), this led to constitutive activation of the receptor. Parallel to the helix axis and spanning the whole transmembrane region, a distinct strip of residues on one face of transmembrane domain 3 forms intermolecular (acetylcholine-receptor, receptor-G protein) or intrareceptor bonds that contribute to the activated state. The binding of acetylcholine may destabilize the first set of contacts while favoring the formation of the second.

Models of the rhodopsin-like superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors suggest that transmembrane domain 3 (TMD 3) 1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; ACh, acetylcholine; mAChR, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; NMS, (−)-N-methyl scopolamine; QNB, (−)-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate; PI, phosphoinositide; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate forms the core of the seven-membered helical bundle that traverses the phospholipid bilayer (1Baldwin J.M.

Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 61-78PubMed Google Scholar). Spin labeling and cross-linking studies on Cys-substituted rhodopsin mutants have shown that a reorganization of the contacts between TMD 3 and surrounding transmembrane domains probably accompanies receptor activation (3Farabakhsh Z.T.

Substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis of TMD 3 of the D2 dopamine receptor has supported its α-helical character (6Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). TMD 3 of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) is constrained at its N terminus by the conserved disulfide-bonded residue Cys98 (7Kurtenbach E. Curtis C.A.M. Pedder E.K. Aitken A.

Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and, near its C terminus, Arg123, which is completely conserved in the rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors and is important in G protein binding and activation (11Zhu S.Z. Wang S.Z. Hu J. El-Fakahany E.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jones P.G. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the M1 mAChR, the highly conserved residues Asp122 and Tyr124appear to make intramolecular contacts whose integrity is important for receptor expression (13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Other residues within TMD 3 may also make inter- or intramolecular contacts, and these may be important determinants of receptor structure and activation. Scanning mutagenesis can help to establish the secondary structure of receptor domains (6Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and to locate and define functional epitopes within them (14Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). Replacement of individual amino acids by alanine, which deletes the side chain beyond the β-carbon (in this study, Ala residues themselves were replaced by Gly), is normally well tolerated and allows the functions of individual side chains to be probed and analyzed (15Ward W.H.J. Timms D. Fersht A.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 280-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have applied this systematic approach to residues 100–121 of TMD 3 of the M1 mAChR. The results show that different, topographically distinct, groups of amino acids are responsible for the selective stabilization of the ground and activated states of the receptor. We propose that ACh binding causes TMD 3 to switch from one set of contacts to the other. A preliminary account of some of these results has been given (16Hulme E.C. Lu Z.-L. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Experimental procedures were performed as described previously (10Page K.M. Curtis C.A.M. Jones P.G. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Jones P.G. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, residues 100–121 of the rat M1 mAChR were individually mutated to Ala (or, if they were Ala in the parent sequence, to Gly), using a polymerase chain reaction method. After verification by dideoxy sequencing, mutant receptors were subcloned into the pCD expression vector and expressed transiently in COS-7 cells by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 180 V and 960 microfarads with 10 μg of DNA/0.4-cm cuvette (4 × 107 cells, 0.8 ml). Membrane preparations were made after 72 h as described previously (13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Binding of (−)-N-[3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS), and (−)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to membrane preparations was measured at 30 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Na-HEPES, 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm MgCl2 using an incubation time of 60 min to 3 h, as described previously (10Page K.M. Curtis C.A.M. Jones P.G. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The binding of ACh and other unlabeled ligands was measured by inhibition of the binding of the tritiated antagonist. For the study of guanine nucleotide shifts, MgCl2 was replaced by 2 mmMnCl2 (12Jones P.G. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositide (PI) turnover was assayed as described previously (12Jones P.G. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected COS-7 cells were prelabeled with [3H] inositol for 48 h, followed by washing and preincubation with Krebs bicarbonate solution containing 10 mm LiCl for 30 min, and then ACh or other agonists were added for 30 min. When the effects of antagonists on the basal phosphoinositide response were to be studied, the antagonist was added at different times up to 48 h before the performance of the PI assay. In some instances, the antagonist was washed out (three changes of Krebs bicarbonate solution without Li+ over a period of about 15 min) before adding Li+ for 30 min to initiate the PI assay. Expression of receptor protein was assessed 72 h after transfection by incubation of fixed, permeabilized cells with a 1:100 dilution of an immunoaffinity-purified antiserum raised against the C-terminal 13 amino acids of the M1 mAChR sequence (13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This was followed by incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of an alkaline phosphatase-labeled second antibody and visualization as described (13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). (−)-N-[3H]methylscopolamine (85 Ci/mmol), (−)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (50 Ci/mmol), and myo-d-[3H]inositol (80 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) tetralithium salt, was from Boehringer Mannheim. Binding curves were analyzed (10Page K.M. Curtis C.A.M. Jones P.G. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Jones P.G. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using SigmaPlot (SPSS Software Inc.). Ligand saturation curves were fitted to a one-site model of binding to yield an affinity constant,KBin, and a total concentration of binding sites, RT. Competition curves were fitted to the Hill equation, or to one-site or two-site models of binding. Binding constants were corrected for the Cheng-Prusoff shift, as necessary (13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the agonist KBinis taken to be the reciprocal of the corrected IC50 value. PI dose-response curves were fitted to a four-parameter logistic function, yielding a basal activity (PIbas), a maximum response (PImax), an EC50 value, and a slope factor. The slopes of the PI dose-response curves were, on average, not significantly different from 1.0. The KAct value is defined as 1/EC50. Emax is the maximum receptor-induced signal, defined as (PImax,mut − PIbas,wt)/(PImax,wt − PIbas,wt). For two constitutively active mutants, the basal activity parameter, denoted Basal, was calculated relative to the wild-type receptor as (PIbas,mut − PIbas,wt)/(PImax,mut − PIbas,wt). With these two exceptions,Basal = 0. Agonist signaling efficacy values were calculated by fitting the ratio ([RG] + [ARG])/[GT] calculated from the ternary complex model (17DeLean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the dose-response data, where [RG] is the concentration of the receptor-G protein binary complex, [ARG] is the concentration of the agonist-receptor-G protein ternary complex, and [GT] is the receptor-accessible concentration of G protein. Unless the basal activity is raised, the contribution of [RG] can be ignored. The calculation uses the agonist binding constant, KBin, and an estimate of the effective ratio of total receptor concentration to receptor-accessible G protein, [RT]/[GT], denoted RT. In performing these calculations, we have used the value of 20 forRT for the wild-type receptor estimated in a previous study in which the effect of an irreversible blocking agent on the ACh dose-response curve was studied (13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Values of RT for the different mutants were calculated from the expression of [3H]NMS binding sites. For the L116A mutant, the calculatedRT value of 0.4 is consistent with the experimentally determined Emax of 40% of wild type (legend to Fig. 3). The agonist signaling efficacy parameter isKG·[GT] (denotedKG), where KGis the apparent affinity constant of the G protein for the ensemble of agonist-receptor complexes. KG was computed to reproduce the pEC50 of the PI dose-response curve. For values of RT > 1, the efficacy parameter, KG, was calculated as follows. K¯G=(KAct/(KBin(1−Basal))−1)/R¯T(whenEmax∼1)(Eq. 1) or K¯G=(Emax/(1−Emax))/R¯T(whenEmax<1)(Eq. 2) These equations are extensions of those derived by Whaleyet al. (18Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L.

When RT was <1, the efficacy was calculated from a fit of the ternary complex model to the dose-response data, as described previously (13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Several Ala substitution mutations in the N-terminal half of TMD 3 strongly reduced the affinity of the quaternary antagonist NMS (Fig. 1a). D105A and Y106A gave 100-fold reductions, measured by direct radioligand saturation or by competition binding assays (10Page K.M. Curtis C.A.M. Jones P.G. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). 10-Fold reductions followed mutations of Trp101, Leu102, Asn110, and Val113. Large decreases were also seen in the affinity of the tertiary antagonist QNB (legend to Fig. 1), 6000-fold for D105A (measured by competition with [3H]NMS), and 31-fold for Y106A. In contrast, mutations in the C-terminal part of TMD 3 had little effect on NMS affinity. The largest change was a 2-fold reduction, from I119A (Fig. 1a). Ala substitutions in the C-terminal part of the domain had the largest effects on the expression of [3H]NMS binding sites. The L116A mutant was expressed at 2% of the wild-type level. Mutations of Val113, Asn115, and Leu117 also caused greater than 3-fold reductions (Fig. 1b). In the N-terminal region, only the mutation of Asp105 decreased receptor expression, to 10% of the wild-type level. Unusually, mutation of Asn110 somewhat enhanced receptor expression. Alterations in the expression of the receptor protein were also visualized by immunocytochemical staining of transfected cells using an antibody directed against the C terminus of the receptor (Fig. 2). As noted previously, the apparent variation in staining intensity was less than might be expected from the variation in expression of binding sites, suggesting that, particularly in the case of poorly expressing mutants such as D105A (Fig. 2e), part of the receptor protein was misfolded or was inappropriately localized (13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Acetylcholine binding was assayed by inhibition of the binding of [3H]NMS. ACh binding to the wild-type receptor expressed in COS-7 cells gave a slightly flattened isotherm (nH = 0.9) with aKBin of 1.26 × 105m−1 (10Page K.M. Curtis C.A.M. Jones P.G. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mutations that diminished NMS affinity caused reductions in the affinity of ACh (Fig. 3a). Mutation of Ser109, which was without effect on NMS binding, gave a 10-fold reduction in the affinity of ACh. Three mutations located between the center and the C terminus of TMD 3 increased the affinity of ACh by between 4- and 30-fold. They were V113A, L116A, and S120A. In COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type M1 mAChR, ACh elicits a robust phosphoinositide response, with an EC50 of 70 nm and a maximum stimulation of 3 times the basal activity (13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Qualitatively, the effects of the Ala substitution mutations on the PI response were parallel to their effects on ACh binding. Mutations that decreased ACh affinity decreased the KAct (defined as 1/EC50), while mutations that increased ACh affinity increased the KAct (Fig. 3b). However, S112A decreased ACh potency without affecting its affinity. The quantitative effects of the D105A, Y106A, and I119A mutations on ACh potency in the PI response were much greater than their effects on ACh binding. In particular, the D105A mutant completely failed to give a PI response to ACh stimulation, and ACh potency was decreased by more than 1000-fold by both the Y106A and I119A mutations. The basal PI activities of most of the mutant receptors were between 92% (I119A) and 112% of the wild-type basal, but that of the S120A mutant was significantly raised (122 ± 6%; p < 0.01;Basal = 0.07). Receptor-transducer models (19Black J.W. Leff P. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1983; 220: 141-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar), such as the ternary complex model (17DeLean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), can be used to quantitate the effects of mutations on signaling efficacy. Provided that signal generation is directly proportional to the sum of the concentrations of the RG binary and ARG ternary complexes, there exists a quantitative relationship between the maximum response,Emax (as a fraction of the maximum obtainable signal); the KAct; the basal activity parameter,Basal; and the agonist binding constant,KBin (parameter definitions are given under “Experimental Procedures”). When the ratio of receptor concentration to accessible G protein concentration is greater than 1, the relationship is as follows. Emax=1−(1−Basal)·KBin/KAct(Eq. 3) For the present set of mutants, as well as R123A, R123K (12Jones P.G. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and D105E (10Page K.M. Curtis C.A.M. Jones P.G. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), this relationship is reasonably well obeyed (Fig. 4a). In only one case, N115A, was the deviation of the measured from the predictedEmax greater than 20% of the total signal, suggesting a reduction in the signaling activity of the ternary complex in this case. A measure of agonist signaling efficacy, adjusted for differences in receptor expression level, is provided by the affinity of the G protein for the ensemble of agonist-receptor complexes,KG, multiplied by the concentration of receptor-accessible G protein, [GT] (Refs. 13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,16Hulme E.C. Lu Z.-L. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 18Whaley B.S. Yuan N. Birnbaumer L. Clark R.B. Barber R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 481-489PubMed Google Scholar; see “Experimental Procedures”). The efficacy values obtained for ACh activation of the TMD 3 mutants are illustrated in Fig. 4b. Deleting the side chains of Tyr106 and Ile119caused reductions in the calculated signaling efficacy of ACh of 100-fold or greater. The D105A mutant had zero efficacy. There were also 10-fold effects from Trp101, Ser109, and Ser112. In contrast, the mutations of Leu116and Ser120 caused 2.2- and 1.4-fold increases in the ACh signaling efficacy, respectively. The effects of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPγS (10−5m) were investigated on the mutants that showed enhanced ACh affinity and efficacy. Binding studies were performed in the presence of 2 mm Mn2+ions to promote the stability of the agonist-receptor G protein complex (12Jones P.G. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mn2+ increased the affinity of ACh for the wild-type receptor by 1.5-fold relative to the standard Mg2+-containing buffer, but no significant GTPγS shift resulted. The V113A, and L116A mutants also showed no GTP shift. Mn2+ enhanced the affinity of ACh for the S120A mutant by 3-fold; in this case, the binding data could be described by a two-site model of binding (pKdL = 5.74 ± 0.01 (60% of total sites); pKdH = 7.33 ± 0.06 (40% of total sites)). GTPγS gave a significant decrease in the ACh affinity for this mutant. Analysis showed a 3.5-fold decrease in the high affinity binding constant (pKdH = 6.79 ± 0.11; p < 0.05) without an effect on the low affinity binding constant. The partial nature of this effect indicates that only a fraction of the high affinity sites were affected. The mutants that showed increased ACh affinity and efficacy were probed with the partial agonist pilocarpine. Pilocarpine gave 78% of the maximum PI response elicited by ACh at the wild-type receptor (Fig. 5). With respect to the wild-type receptor, V113A and L116A gave approximately 10-fold increases in affinity for pilocarpine, while S120A gave less than a 2-fold enhancement (Fig. 5). The potencies of pilocarpine in the PI response were increased by all three mutations. At the V113A and S120A mutants, pilocarpine became a full agonist. At the L116A mutant, its maximum effect was maintained with respect to that of ACh, despite the very low expression of the mutant receptor. Calculation of the efficacy of pilocarpine gave a value equal to 1.4% of the efficacy of ACh at the wild-type receptor. This was increased to 5% (3.6-fold) for the S120A and V113A mutants and to 30% (21-fold) for the L116A mutant. The mutants that showed enhanced ACh and pilocarpine efficacies were examined for inverse agonist effects. Preincubation of transfected cells with NMS for 24–48 h before the addition of LiCl and the isolation of phosphoinositides reduced the basal activity of the S120A mutant (Basal = 7% of the maximum PI signal) to the wild-type basal level with an IC50 of 10−8m (Fig. 6a). There was no detectable effect of NMS on the basal activity of the wild-type receptor, but in some experiments a reduction of about 3% in the V113A Basalparameter was seen (not shown). Prolonged incubations of cells transfected with the L116A mutant with NMS (Fig. 6a) or atropine increased the basal PI signal. To see whether this effect might be partly mediated by an ability to stabilize, and so up-regulate, the receptor, we examined the effect of atropine on the level of expression of the L116A mutant by immunocytochemistry and by [3H]NMS binding. A 48-h incubation of the cells with atropine increased the accumulation of the L116A protein (Fig. 2d) but not the wild-type receptor (Fig. 2c). Measurement of [3H]NMS saturation curves after atropine pretreatment of the cells showed no effect on the wild-type receptor, but the expression of the L116A mutant was increased by up to 50-fold, close to the wild-type level, without changing the NMS affinity (Fig. 6b) or the ACh binding properties (data not shown). Preincubation with atropine (10−4m) also doubled the expression of the D105A mutant (data not shown). Atropine pretreatment of the transfected cells, followed by washout, before measurement of the PI response increased the basal activity of the L116A mutant to a level equivalent to 70–120% of the maximum signal obtained in cells transfected with the wild-type receptor. The enhanced basal activity was partially inhibited by the addition of atropine, with an IC50 of 10−8m(Fig. 6c). The PI signal was stimulated by 40% by the addition of carbachol (Fig. 6c) or ACh (not shown). The Basal parameter was equivalent to 70% of the maximum signal in these cells. In contrast, pretreatment with atropine had no effect on the PI response of the wild-type receptor. One category of residues is those whose mutation had minimal effect, defined as less than a 3-fold change in the level of receptor expression, in NMS and ACh affinities and less than a 6-fold change in ACh functional potency. Five of these (Leu100, Ala103, Leu104, Val107, and Ala108) occur in the N-terminal half of TMD 3, and three (Met114, Leu118, and Phe121) occur in the C-terminal half. In a helical wheel plot, they are clustered in one sector (Fig. 7a), strongly supporting an α-helical conformation for TMD 3. Cys substitution mutants of the equivalent positions in the D2 receptor failed to react with a polar sulfhydryl reagent (6Javitch J.A. Fu D. Chen J. Karlin A. Neuron. 1995; 14: 825-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In both receptor types, these residues probably face toward the lipid bilayer. A helical net representation (Fig. 7b) shows that the sector of TMD 3 in which mutations can be made without major effect narrows toward the cytoplasmic end of the helix, in agreement with models based on the structure of rhodopsin, which suggest that this part of the helix is mostly surrounded by the other TMDs (1Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The residues whose mutation lowered receptor expression levels have the opposite distribution. They are concentrated in the C-terminal half of TMD3 (Fig. 7b) and are spread over 220° of arc. We have argued that the side chains of such residues make intramolecular contacts that contribute to the stability of the transmembrane structure of the ground state of the receptor (13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Their removal reduces the free energy of the folded state with respect to inactive intermediates on the folding pathway. Besides Asp122 and Tyr124 (13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we have now found a third position, Leu116, at which a side chain deletion strongly reduced the level of expression. Three other mutations in the C-terminal part of the helix also had significant effects. Only one such sensitive residue occurs in the N-terminal half of the helix. Interestingly, it is the binding site aspartate itself. The distribution of these mutants suggests that the side chains of residues in the C-terminal half of TMD 3 make more frequent intramolecular contacts than those in the N-terminal half. The free energy difference between the folded and unfolded states was restored by incubation of the expressing cells with a high affinity antagonist. This counteracted the effect of the L116A mutation on expression and doubled the expression of the D105A mutant. At three of the six positions in the C-terminal half of the domain (Val113, Leu116, and, as reported in Ref. 13Lu Z.-L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, Asp122), mutations that decreased expression levels increased ACh affinity; in two cases (Val113 and Leu116), signaling efficacy and/or basal activity was also increased. Mutations of acidic residues homologous to Asp122 in rhodopsin (20Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 21Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the α1 receptor (22Scheer A. Fanelli F. Costa T. De Benedetti P.G. Cotecchia S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3566-3578Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and the β2 receptor (23Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) increase basal activity, but we have not observed this for mutations of Asp122 in the M1mAChR, even after antagonist preincubation to increase the expression levels. 2Z-L. Lu, unpublished observations. In contrast, S120A behaved like a classical constitutively active mutant, showing raised basal activity, increased agonist affinity, enhanced efficacy of a partial agonist, and an increased GTP shift (24Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Wells J.W. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10109-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Together, Val113, Leu116, and Ser120 form a compact patch of residues located on the inward facing surface of the cytoplasmic half of TMD 3 (Fig. 7b). In the extended ternary complex model of agonist-receptor-G protein interaction, a conformational equilibrium is postulated to exist between preexisting ground and active states of the receptor, governed by an isomerization constant, K (24Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Agonists bind to the ground state conformation with low affinity, Ka, but to the activated state with a higher affinity, α·Ka. In the simplest case, the G-protein binds selectively to the activated conformation. The extended ternary complex model offers three routes to mutational effects on efficacy: a change in the isomerization constant, K; a change in the agonist cooperativity, α; or a change in the affinity of the G protein for the activated receptor, KG. A selective increase in K provides the most economical explanation for the simultaneously increased basal activity, agonist affinity, and signaling efficacy of the group of constitutively active mutants (24Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it is not possible entirely to exclude an increase in KG, combined with a simultaneous increase in Ka or in the cooperativity factor α. A priori, an increase in KG seems unlikely to result from a side chain deletion. Detailed calculations based on the assumption of a changed isomerization constant (described in Ref. 16Hulme E.C. Lu Z.-L. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) have suggested a value of about 2 × 10−4 for K for the wild-type M1 receptor and increases of about 2- and 40-fold in this parameter for the S120A and L116A mutants. Particularly in the case of L116A, this may reflect a selective destabilization of the ground state of the receptor, because the expression of the mutant was decreased by approximately the same ratio. These changes are enough to account for the observed increases in the ACh binding affinity, as well as in the ACh signaling efficacy, without an increase in the ground state binding constant, Ka (16Hulme E.C. Lu Z.-L. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, in the case of the L116A mutant, Ka for pilocarpine may be increased. The pharmacology of this mutant would repay further investigation, particularly as it retains some signaling activity even in the presence of NMS and atropine (Fig. 6, a and c). This may imply a partial uncoupling of the ligand binding site from the G protein binding site. For V113A, there is a 30% increase in the signaling efficacy of ACh (16Hulme E.C. Lu Z.-L. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1998; 92: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and a 3-fold increase for pilocarpine. However, the 10-fold increases observed in ACh and pilocarpine binding affinity and a significant decrease in antagonist affinity imply an additional perturbation of the ground state conformation of the receptor by this mutation. The residues whose mutation decreased the signaling efficacy of ACh form a strip extending the full length of TMD 3 (Fig. 7b). In the outer, N-terminal, part of the helix, they lie on the opposite face to the sector of null residues. In the inner, C-terminal, part, they are displaced by one residue (100° of arc) from the group of residues whose mutations enhanced signaling. The mutation of Trp101, Asp105, Tyr106, and Ser109 strongly reduced ACh signaling efficacy. Mutation of these residues also reduced the ground state binding of ACh and, with the exception of Ser109, decreased the affinities of NMS and QNB. Mutation of the two more peripheral residues, Leu102 and Asn110, inhibited ground state binding of ACh but had little effect on receptor activation. Our studies suggest that Tyr106 contributes almost as much free energy as Asp105 to the binding of NMS. This may indicate an amino-aromatic interaction (26Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar), since mutation of the equivalent Tyr to Phe in the M3 mAChR had little effect on the binding of NMS, although it reduced the affinity of ACh (27Wess J. Gdula D. Brann M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3729-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast, Asp105 plays a much larger part in the binding of the tertiary amine QNB, consistent with the formation of a charge-reinforced hydrogen bond. In the case of Trp101, the aromaticity of the side chain has been reported to be important for both NMS and ACh binding (28Matsui H. Lazareno S. Birdsall N.J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 88-98PubMed Google Scholar). In general, the data support the conjecture of Hibert et al. that aromatic as well as polar interactions are important for the binding of muscarinic ligands (29Hibert M.F. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bruinvels A. Hoflack J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 8-15PubMed Google Scholar). These findings underline the primary role of Asp105, supported by Tyr106 in ACh binding and signal transduction (9Spalding T.A. Birdsall N.J.M. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4092-4097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Page K.M. Curtis C.A.M. Jones P.G. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 289: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Wess J. Gdula D. Brann M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3729-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Notably, Asp105 is the only residue in this set whose mutation completely abolished signaling. However, Asp105 appears to have a complex function. It may contribute to the stability of the receptor's ground state structure, as well as being vital for ligand contact. This may imply that its side chain also forms an intramolecular interaction, as appears to be the case for Glu113 in rhodopsin (30Robinson P.R. Cohen G.B. Zhukovsky E.A. Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The tightly delimited strip of residues whose mutation strongly diminished ACh signaling efficacy extends to the cytoplasmic end of the helix. At this point, it becomes continuous with residues homologous to the functionally conserved residues recently identified by random saturation mutagenesis in the second intracellular loop of the M5 mAChR (31Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24322-24327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which provides a cytoplasmic extension of TMD 3. Mutation of Ser112 and particularly Ile119 as well as Arg123 (12Jones P.G. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) had large effects on ACh signaling efficacy. However, these mutations did not strongly affect receptor expression levels, suggesting that these residues make limited contributions to the stability of the ground state. The mutation S112A caused a small but significant enhancement of NMS affinity, while I119A decreased NMS as well as ACh affinity. We suggest that the side chains of these two residues make weak intramolecular contacts in the ground state and that these become stronger in the active conformation of the receptor. An interdomain contact has also been postulated for the residue homologous to Ile119 in the GnRH receptor (32Ballesteros J. Kitanovic S. Guarnieri F. Davies P. Fromme B.J. Konvicka K. Chi L. Millar R.P. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10445-10453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). If this is true, the main effect of the deletion of these side chains should be to decrease the isomerization constant, K. However, it is not possible to exclude the possibility of a more direct role for them in the formation of the G protein binding pocket, leading to effects on KG; the basal activity of the I119A mutant is decreased,2 showing that there are reductions in the product K·KG, which governs basal activity. Arg123 also has the potential for direct binding to the G protein as well as for intrareceptor contacts (12Jones P.G. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). With the possible exception of Asn115, there is no evidence that these residues influence the catalytic steps within the ARG ternary complex that occur subsequent to its formation. In summary, scanning mutagenesis has revealed strong functional differentiation of the surface of TMD 3 of the M1 mAChR. It has demonstrated the α-helical secondary structure of the domain and suggested its orientation with respect to the other transmembrane elements and the lipid bilayer. The results suggest that the C-terminal half of the helix is deeply buried within the receptor structure. On the buried surface, we propose that a distinct group of amino acid side-chains make intramolecular bonds that selectively stabilize the ground state of the receptor. Mutagenic disruption of these characteristically decreases receptor expression and increases agonist affinity and signal transduction. Running parallel to the helix axis and spanning the whole transmembrane region, a topologically distinct strip of residues on one face of TMD 3 forms intermolecular (ACh-receptor, receptor-G protein) or intramolecular bonds that are necessary for the stability or activity of the ARG ternary complex. Mutation of these decreases signal transduction. The binding of ACh may disrupt the first set of contacts while promoting the second. This may trigger the rotational movement of TMD 3 deduced from spectroscopic studies of rhodopsin (4Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) and the β2 receptor (23Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), and could mobilize the cytoplasmic ends of the surrounding TMDs. We propose that TMD 3 and its cytoplasmic extension (31Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24322-24327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) may act as an intramolecular rotary switch in receptor activation. Several of the key amino acids, particularly Ser112, Leu116, Ile119, Ser120, Asp122, Arg123, and Tyr124, are very highly conserved in the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (1Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), suggesting the potential generality of such a mechanism."

We developed a stepwise RNA pol II walking approach and used Western blotting to determine the role of TFIIH and P-TEFb in HIV-1 transcription elongation. Our results demonstrate the new findings that P-TEFb is a component of the preinitiation complex and travels with the elongating RNA pol II, whereas TFIIH is released from the elongation complexes before the trans-activation responsive region RNA is synthesized.

We developed a stepwise RNA pol II walking approach and used Western blotting to determine the role of TFIIH and P-TEFb in HIV-1 transcription elongation. Our results demonstrate the new findings that P-TEFb is a component of the preinitiation complex and travels with the elongating RNA pol II, whereas TFIIH is released from the elongation complexes before the trans-activation responsive region RNA is synthesized. Our results suggest that TFIIH and P-TEFb are involved in the clearance of promoter-proximal pausing of RNA pol II on the HIV-1 long terminal repeat at different stages. Transcription elongation in eukaryotic genes is a complex process that involves a number of regulatory factors. It is becoming increasingly clear that the elongation stage of RNA pol II 1The abbreviations used are: pol II, polymerase II; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; LTR, long terminal repeat; TAR, trans-activation responsive region; PIC, preinitiation complex; TEC, transcription elongation complex; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is a major regulatory process of gene expression (1Spencer C.

After successful initiation of RNA synthesis, RNA pol II can pause, get arrested, pass through terminator sequences, or terminate transcription. Release of RNA pol II from stalled complexes is a rate-limiting step in transcription of inducible eukaryotic genes (3Greenblatt J. Nodwell J.R. Mason S.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 4Bentley D.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Blair W. Fridell R.

In the absence of inducer protein, RNA pol II elongation complexes pause 20–60 nucleotides downstream of the promoter. Promoter-proximal pausing is released by DNA- or RNA-binding activators that recruit or stimulate positive-acting transcription elongation factors. General transcription factors such as TFIIH play a key role in promoter clearance and the promoter-proximal release of RNA pol II (8Goodrich J.A. Tjian R.

Human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a small regulatory protein, Tat, which is required for efficient transcription of viral genes. Tat enhances the processivity of RNA pol II elongation complexes that initiate in the HIV LTR region. Tat activates transcription by binding to a highly structured RNA element, TAR RNA, that is located at the 5′ end of nascent viral transcripts (for review see Refs. 10Cullen B.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 417-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and 11Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Tat functions through TAR RNA to control an early step in transcription elongation that is sensitive to protein kinase inhibitors and requires the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA pol II (12Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The Tat protein contains two important functional regions: an arginine-rich region that is required for binding to TAR RNA and an activation domain that mediates the interactions with cellular machinery (11Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 717-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Tat has been reported to interact with a number of cellular proteins associated with transcription, including TFIID (13Kashanchi F. Piras G. Radonovich M.F. Duvall J.F. Fattaey A. Chiang C.-M.

Cell. 1998; 93: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The transactivation domain of Tat interacts with TAK (22Herrmann C. Rice A.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was recently shown to be identical to the kinase subunit of P-TEFb, a positive-acting transcription elongation factor (24Zhu Y.

Peng J. Xie Z. Price D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27176-27183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence has established that the CTD is required for Tat transactivation (29Chun R.F. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27888-27894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Okamoto H. Sheline C.T. Corden J.L. Jones K.A. Peterlin B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is possible that P-TEFb kinase activities are also involved in regulation of other cellular proteins. P-TEFb is composed of at least two subunits: the catalytic subunit cyclic-dependent kinase CDK9 (previously named PITALRE) and the regulatory subunit cyclin T1 (24Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 32Yang X. Gold M.O. Tang D.N. Lewis D.E.

Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Complexes containing CDK9 and cyclin T1-related proteins, cyclin T2a or cyclin T2b, are also active for P-TEFb activity (34Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that cyclin T1 interacts directly with the activation domain of Tat and mediates its high affinity and specific binding to TAR RNA (33Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.-M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Tat-cyclin T1 interaction is distinctive in nature because other Tat-binding proteins identified so far have not been shown to enhance Tat affinity and specificity for TAR RNA. Therefore, cyclin T1 interaction with Tat could be responsible for P-TEFb recruitment to the RNA pol II elongation complexes stalled after TAR RNA. In this paper, we provide the evidence that P-TEFb is a component of the preinitiation complex and travels with the RNA pol II elongation complex as the nascent RNA is synthesized. As outlined in Fig. 1, we have used an experimental strategy to walk RNA pol II in stepwise transcription and to stall elongation complexes at specific sites. The stalled transcription complexes were purified by first magnetic beads and then by releasing the template DNA by cleaving it with restriction enzymes. The protein composition in the released complexes was then measured by Western blotting. Our results demonstrate that P-TEFb is a component of the preinitiation complex and travels with the elongating RNA pol II, whereas TFIIH is released from the elongation complexes before the TAR RNA is synthesized. Our results suggest that two cellular kinases, TFIIH and P-TEFb, are involved in the clearance of promoter-proximal pausing of RNA pol II on the HIV-1 LTR at different stages. The test plasmids (pWT2 and pPT529) used in this study were derived from the p10SLT plasmid, which contains HIV-1 5′-LTR (35Keen N.J. Gait M.J. Karn J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2505-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Plasmid pWT2 was constructed by inserting a synthesized DNA fragment containing a triplex target sequence (5′-AAA AGA AAA GGG GGG-3′) between the HindIII and NarI sites of plasmid p10SLT. Plasmid pPT529 contains a triplex target sequence at +529 between XbaI and XbaI sites of p10SLT. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were synthesized on an automated DNA/RNA synthesizer (ABI 392). Psoralen was conjugated to the 5′ end of the triplex probes (see Fig. 1) by using phosphoramidite derivatives of psoralen. Biotin-modified oligonucleotides were prepared on biotin containing support. Cytosine was replaced by 5-methyl-cytosine. All the oligonucleotides were deprotected in ammonium hydroxide at 55 °C for 8 h and purified on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Linearized DNA (final concentration, 0.1 μm) was incubated with excess psoralen-oligonucleotide probe (×250) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm spermine for 30 min at 37 °C and then cooled down slowly to room temperature. The mixture was irradiated with UV (360 nm) in a Photochemical Reactor for 8 min. For magnetic bead binding, template DNA was separated from unreacted psoralen-oligonucleotide probe on 1.2% agarose gels. Template DNA (0.5 μg) cross-linked to a psoralen probe modified with biotin was bound to 25 μl of streptavidin-coated magnetic bead (250 μg, Dynal Inc.) by incubating DNA and beads in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 m NaCl at room temperature overnight on a shaker. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared according to published procedures (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar, 37Deissler H. Behn-Krappa A. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (38Wang Z. Rana T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6688-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Preinitiation complexes (PICs) were formed by incubating the immobilized DNA templates (200 ng) in a volume of 25 μl containing 12 μl of nuclear extract, 6 mmMgCl2, and 0.5 μg of poly(dA·dT) for 15 min at 30 °C. PICs were washed with 25 μl of washing buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 6 mmMgCl2) to remove unbound proteins. The PICs were walked to position U14 by incubation with 12.5 mm phosphocreatine, 20 μm CTP, GTP, and UTP, 20 μm dATP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P] CTP (25 Ci/mmol, ICN; final concentration, 160 μm) for 5 min at room temperature. Transcription elongation complexes (TECs) stalled at U14 were washed with 25 μl of wash buffer B (wash buffer A containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 0.015% Sarkosyl) and twice with wash buffer C (wash buffer A containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40). The TECs stalled at U14 were walked stepwise along the DNA by repeated incubation with different sets of three NTPs. Unincorporated NTPs were removed by washing the immobilized complexes with buffer C. To isolate RNA products from stalled TECs, 175 μl of stop solution (0.3 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA) was added. The mixture was extracted with 200 μl of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (50:48:2) and then with chloroform (200 μl). RNA transcripts were precipitated with ethanol and analyzed on 15% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. For the isolation of ternary complexes, the PICs and TECs stalled at different steps on immobilized DNA templates were digested with restriction enzymes at 30 °C. The solution phase containing ternary complexes was mixed with 1 × SDS gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) at 100 °C for 3 min. Released proteins were separated from beads, fractionated by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes to detect protein composition. The RNA pol II CTD antibody was a gift from Michael E. Dahmus (University of California, Davis), and the CDK9 antibody was a gift from David H. Price (University of Iowa, Iowa City). The polyclonal antibodies to TFIIH (p89 and p62) and TBP were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Complexes were visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by using anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. The blots were exposed to x-ray film for various times (between 10 s and 10 min). To determine the protein composition of transcription elongation complexes at different stages, it is important to isolate homogeneous populations of RNA pol II ternary complexes stalled at specific sites. We used triplex DNA structure and psoralen photochemistry to immobilize DNA templates and stall elongation complexes (38Wang Z. Rana T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6688-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The experimental strategy for site-specific psoralen cross-links in the DNA template containing HIV-1 promoter to isolate the stalled RNA pol II elongation complexes is outlined in Fig. 1. This method involves the following five steps: 1) insertion of a target sequence for triple helix formation at a predetermined position in the DNA template; 2) restriction digest with an enzyme to yield the triplex site upstream or downstream of the promoter sequences; 3) synthesis of a third strand for triplex formation containing a psoralen at its 5′ end and a biotin at the 3′ end; 4) triplex formation between the DNA template and the third strand followed by nearly ultraviolet irradiation (360 nm); and 5) immobilization of the cross-linked DNA template on streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads and in vitrotranscription. Immobilized DNA templates with beads upstream of the promoter were used for stepwise walking of RNA pol II, and DNA templates with beads downstream of the promoter were used to stall elongation complexes chased with all four nucleotides. Preinitiation complexes were formed on immobilized DNA templates, and elongation was initiated by adding dATP, UTP, CTP, and GTP. These elongation complexes were starved for ATP and therefore stalled at U14. Further initiation was inhibited by sarkosyl wash as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Stepwise walking of the TECs stalled at U14 was accomplished by repeated incubation with different sets of three NTPs (39Cai H. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 298-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical gel of our RNA pol II walking experiments is shown in Fig. 2. TECs stalled at A-22, C-30, G-36, U-46, A-51, and C-61 are shown. Viability of the stalled complexes was confirmed by adding all four NTPs, which produced run-off products of expected lengths indicating that 100% of the complexes were transcriptionally active (data not shown). We formed preinitiation and stalled transcription elongation complexes on DNA templates immobilized on streptavidin beads, and the DNA was cleaved with restriction enzymes to isolate the RNA pol II complexes. The strategy for these experiments is outlined in Fig. 3 (A and B). To isolate PICs, DNA was cleaved at the BspE1 restriction site. For isolation of TECs, RNA pol II complexes were stalled at different sites and then cleaved with BglII. RNA contents were analyzed on 7 m urea, 15% polyacrylamide gels (as shown in Fig. 2), and proteins were separated on denaturing SDS gels. Recently, it has been reported that P-TEFb is involved in Tat transactivation (12Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 24Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J.

Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). A number of studies also suggest that TFIIH kinase complex plays an important role in Tat activation (16Parada C.A. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 384: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 17Garcia-Martinez L.F. Mavankal G. Neveu J.M. Lane W.S. Ivanov D. Gaynor R.B.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We planned to investigate the role of TFIIH and P-TEFb in transcription using HeLa nuclear extracts and DNA templates containing HIV-1 promoter. We used immobilized templates and isolated RNA pol II preinitiation and elongation complexes stalled at different sites during transcription as described above. Complexes were released by cleaving DNA templates with restriction enzymes and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and various proteins were detected by Western blotting with antibodies raised against TBP, two subunits of TFIIH (p89 or ERCC3 and p62), RNA pol II, and a subunit of P-TEFb (CDK9). Affinity purified antibodies against TFIIH and TBP were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RNA pol II and CDK9 antibodies were kindly provided by Drs. Michael Dahmus (University of California, Davis) and David Price (University of Iowa, Iowa City), respectively. Results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 3C. P-TEFb is a component of RNA pol II preinitiation complex and remains attached to the elongation complexes stalled at C-30 and C-71. On the other hand, TFIIH is detected in the PICs and not in the TECs stalled at C-30 and C71. To confirm that sarkosyl treatment of TECs did not remove TFIIH and other transcription factors, we isolated TECs stalled at A-15 and washed with sarkosyl containing buffer and analyzed for protein contents as described above. Western analysis showed that TFIIH was present in TECs stalled at A-15 (data not shown). TBP analysis was performed as a control experiment showing that TBP was present in the PICs and not in the stalled elongation complexes (data not shown). Our findings about the assembly and release of TBP and TFIIH are in agreement with previous studies by Zawel et al. (40Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) who used a defined reconstituted transcription system containing adenovirus 2 major late promoter. It is interesting to note that using nuclear extracts and DNA templates containing HIV-1 promoter sequences did not change the properties of TFIIH. To normalize the amount of transcription complexes at each step, we detected RNA pol II by immunoblotting in the PICs and the TECs. It is now generally accepted from previous studies that the PIC contains nonphosphorylated CTD of RNA pol II (IIa) and TECs contain phosphorylated CTD of RNA pol (IIo) (41Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). RNA pol II in elongation complexes is IIo; however, we did not separate IIa and IIo bands in this gel because we were detecting RNA pol II as an internal standard and wanted to detect CDK9 in the same gel and did not run the gel for longer times to resolve proteins with high molecular weights. We were able to separate IIa and IIo when gels were run for longer times (38Wang Z. Rana T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6688-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). No proteins were detected when the PIC formation was inhibited by the addition of sarkosyl (lane 2in Fig. 3C). Western blotting of the nuclear extract was performed as a control experiment for the identification of the correct proteins and to confirm that these proteins are not modified or degraded in our stalled complexes. It is important to note that these experiments are not quantitative; therefore, the relative stoichiometry of P-TEFb in elongation complexes cannot be determined from these results. The intensity of various bands represents the immunoreactivity of the specific antibodies and does not correspond to the amount of proteins present in RNA pol II complexes. For example, TFIIH bands are more intense than CDK9 and RNA pol II (Fig. 3C, lane 3) and do not necessarily represent the stoichiometry of these proteins. During stepwise walking of RNA polymerase II elongation complexes, each wash to remove unincorporated NTPs results in a loss of TECs. To ensure that a sufficient amount of proteins was present in TECs stalled at longer sequences, 10 and 15 standard transcription reactions were used to isolate TECs stalled at C-30 and C-71, respectively. PICs contained three standard transcription reactions. Accordingly, more CDK9 and RNA pol II were detected in TECs stalled at C-30 and C-71 compared with the PICs (Fig. 3C, lanes 3–5). These results establish that P-TEFb is a part of preinitiation and elongation assembly of RNA pol II, whereas TFIIH is released from the elongation complex before full-length TAR RNA is transcribed. The above experiments show that P-TEFb associates with preinitiation transcription complexes and remains attached to the elongation complexes stalled at C-71. To determine whether P-TEFb is released from the TECs after the synthesis of full-length TAR RNA or it associates with the RNA pol II during elongation, we stalled elongation complexes at specific sites by psoralen cross-link adducts (Fig. 4). Transcription complexes were assembled on immobilized templates, and transcription was carried out by adding four NTPs. Analysis of transcription products on denaturing gels showed that the correct size RNA transcripts were produced (Fig. 4B). TECs were stalled on immobilized templates at positions +185 and +529, rinsed with buffers to remove released proteins, and isolated by cleaving DNA with HindIII. Restriction digest with HindIII removed the PICs that could not start transcription. Protein contents were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting using CDK9 antibodies. Fig. 4C shows that elongation complexes stalled at +185 and +529 contain P-TEFb. There was no detectable binding of P-TEFb to the beads or the DNA templates (data not shown). A distinguishing characteristic of P-TEFb is its sensitivity to the kinase inhibitors DRB and H-8 (24Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). We confirmed P-TEFb function by the generation of DRB-sensitive run-off transcripts during transcription in vitro (data not shown). These results demonstrate that P-TEFb is an integral component of RNA pol II elongation complex and travels with the polymerase as the nascent RNA is synthesized. We have utilized a stepwise transcription approach and Western blotting to determine the role of TFIIH and P-TEFb in transcription elongation in HIV-1 promoter. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of Tat transactivation. Several lines of evidence suggest that Tat activation requires the CTD of RNA pol II (16Parada C.A. Roeder R.G.

CTD contains a tandemly reiterated heptapeptide sequence (YSPTSPS) that is differentially phosphorylated during the transcription cycle (for review see Refs. 41Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

The nonphosphorylated form of RNA pol II preferentially associates with the preinitiation complex, whereas RNA pol II derived from isolated ternary complexes is highly phosphorylated (40Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 43Lu H. Flores O. Weinmann R. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10004-10008Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CTD is suggested to be critical for the release of preinitiation complexes from the promoter and could disrupt interactions between the CTD and other mediator proteins and transcription factors, such as TBP (40Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 44Svejstrup J. Li Y. Fellows A. Gnatt S. Bjorklund S. Kornberg R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6075-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Tat stimulates hyperphosphorylation of the CTD in a transcription dependent mannerin vitro (16Parada C.A. Roeder R.G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2836-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Tat is involved in CTD kinase steps to form processive elongation complexes.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2593-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). How does Tat interact with these two kinase complexes and control the processivity of the RNA pol II elongation? On the basis of previous findings and our results, we propose a model for transcriptional activation by Tat (Fig. 5). Tat binds to the preinitiation complex and interacts with TFIIH; however, its interaction with other proteins present in the initiation complex cannot be ruled out (13Kashanchi F. Piras G.

Oliver H. Sigman D. Gaynor R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2089-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been reported earlier that Tat associates with purified transcription preinitiation complexes (45Garcia-Martinez L.F. Ivanov D. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6951-6958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). P-TEFb is also a component of the PIC, but it may not be involved in Tat binding at this point. TFIIH plays a critical role in transcription initiation and promoter clearance (8Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 46Dvir A. Conaway R. Conaway J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and is bound to nonphosphorylated RNA pol II holoenzyme. TFIIH alone or with Tat phosphorylates the CTD and assists in promoter clearance. The TFIIH complex dissociates from the RNA pol II 30–50 nucleotides after initiation and is not part of the elongation complex (40Zawel L. Kumar K.P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1479-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In line with previous findings, we also observed that TFIIH was released from the elongation complexes when 46-nucleotide-long RNA was transcribed. TFIIH is released, whereas Tat remains in the elongation complex by interactions with cyclin T1 subunit of P-TEFb. After the transcription of a functional TAR RNA structure, Tat binds to TAR and repositions P-TEFb kinase in the vicinity of the CTD of RNA pol II. Hyperphosphorylation of the CTD is accomplished by P-TEFb kinase, and processive elongation complexes are formed. We propose that a functional Tat-P-TEFb interaction requires TAR RNA because Tat does not become part of the elongation complexes unless TAR RNA is synthesized (47Keen N.J. Churcher M.J. Karn J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5260-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is also possible that more than one molecule of Tat participate in a single round of transactivation and additional Tat is recruited to the elongation complex after TAR is transcribed. Future studies to define the Tat-interacting regions of TFIIH and P-TEFb complexes and to determine various stages of the CTD phosphorylation will reveal mechanistic details of Tat function.

It is a multisubunit protein complex located in the thylakoid membrane. In cyanobacteria, PSI consists of 11 subunits, whose nomenclature (PsaA to PsaF and PsaI to PsaM) has been derived from the encoding genespsaA to psaF and psaI topsaM. Most of the subunits are membrane-integral. The large subunits PsaA and PsaB coordinate the majority of cofactors both of the electron transfer system and of the antenna system. The remaining antenna chlorophyll a are bound by the smaller membrane-integral subunits. Some of these subunits have additional specialized functions. Thus, for example, PsaL and PsaI are responsible for the formation of PSI-trimers, while PsaF and PsaJ stabilize PsaE in the PSI complex (1Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A.

Only in the case of PsaC could an x-ray structural model be suggested based on a previous electron density map (8Krauß N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct.

The model was derived from the x-ray structure of a 2Fe4S4-ferredoxin from Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (11Adman E.T. Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3801-3806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the high degree of 2-fold rotational symmetry inherent to the core of PsaC, a 2-fold ambiguity regarding its orientation in the PSI complex remained (8Krauß N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 9Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol.

In contrast to PsaC, the characteristic structural features of PsaE could unexpectedly not be located in the previous electron density map. The NMR structure of PsaE had revealed a five-stranded β-barrel forming the core of this subunit (12Falzone C.J. Kao Y.-H. Zhao J. Bryant D.A. Lecomte J.T.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6052-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). No structural model has previously been proposed for PsaD. CD- and NMR-spectroscopical investigations indicate that a central portion of the PsaD sequence is folded into a β-sheet, whereas the N- and C-terminal regions are mobile (13Xia Z. Broadhurst R.W. Laue E.D. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. Bendall D.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). An assignment of the transmembrane α-helices of the x-ray structural model to the membrane-integral subunits of PSI has been suggested (8Krauß N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar,9Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Regarding the connectivity of the subunits PsaA/PsaB, some unobserved loops prevented an unambiguous assignment of individual α-helices to the primary structure. This was especially true of the N-terminal, antenna-binding domains of PsaA and PsaB. Here we confirm the NMR structure of PsaE and describe its position and orientation with respect to the PSI complex. A first structural model of PsaD is presented. It indicates that PsaD partly covers PsaC stromally in a clasplike manner. PsaD thereby approaches and interacts with PsaE. The orientation of the subunit PsaC is discussed in relation to recent biochemical and spectroscopic experiments. A unique assignment of the α-helices of PsaA/PsaB is discussed. Photosystem I was isolated and purified from the thermophilic cyanobacteriumSynechococcus elongatus; crystals were grown by microdialysis by lowering the salt concentration in the surrounding buffer under normal gravity and microgravity (14Fromme P. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 175-184Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15Fromme P. Habilitationsschrift. Fachbereich Chemie, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany1998Google Scholar). Details of the crystallization experiments under microgravity will be published elsewhere. PSI crystals are highly sensitive to any increase in the salt concentration of their surrounding medium. Crystals were consequently soaked with low heavy atom compound concentrations in the range of 0.5–1 mm. To reduce the loss of crystal quality, brought about by incubation with heavy atom compounds, PSI protein was crystallized in the presence of the heavy atom compounds. Only in the case of sodium-2-ethylmercurithiosalicylate, however, did this result in crystals suitable for x-ray analysis. A new native data set with a resolution of 3.5 Å was obtained by merging several partial data sets. They were collected at the EMBL outstation at DESY (Hamburg, beamline BW7b) and ESRF (Grenoble, beamline ID2). A new sodium-2-ethylmercurithiosalicylate derivative data set was collected at LURE (Orsay, beamline DW32). Data collection was performed at 4 °C using Marresearch imaging plates of 30-cm diameter. Data were processed and reduced with the Denzo/Scalepack package (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-327Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). Subsequent scaling and data analysis was done with programs from the CCP4 suite (17Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). To further improve the heavy atom model used in the calculation of the first electron density map at 4-Å resolution (9Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), all heavy atom derivatives were reevaluated using the program SHARP (18de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), and a new sodium-2-ethylmercurithiosalicylate derivative was introduced. For technical reasons, the number of derivatives used was limited to five. Statistics of the native and derivative data sets selected for the calculation of the current electron density map are shown in Table I.Table IX-ray data sets used for the calculation of the new electron density mapDerivativeResolution (maximum)RsymaRsym = ∑h∑i‖Ii(h) − 〈I(h)〉‖/∑h∑iIi(h), where Ii(h) are individual intensities of any reflection and I〈(h)〉 is the mean intensity of this reflection.Average redundancyNo. of reflections with I > 3ςCompletenessÅ%%%Native3.510.74.888.693.4Hg1bObtained by co-crystallization of PSI with 1 mmsodium-2-ethylmercurithiosalicylate.3.810.23.877.188.4Hg24.69.62.983.791.8Pt3.86.73.278.586.5U4.111.93.692.593.5Xe4.611.52.565.575.7a Rsym = ∑h∑i‖Ii(h) − 〈I(h)〉‖/∑h∑iIi(h), where Ii(h) are individual intensities of any reflection and I〈(h)〉 is the mean intensity of this reflection.b Obtained by co-crystallization of PSI with 1 mmsodium-2-ethylmercurithiosalicylate. Open table in a new tab The heavy atom sites, determined by difference Patterson analyses and cross-phased isomorphous difference Fourier syntheses, were refined using the standard modus suggested for SHARP. The relatively low resolution of the available data prevents heavy atom temperature factors being refined. The heavy atom model was improved by inspecting residual log likelihood gradient electron density maps (18de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). They permit correctly and incorrectly identified positions to be distinguished and indicate possible new sites. This procedure was repeated cyclically until convergence was achieved. The resulting phases were further improved by the solvent flattening procedure as implemented in the program SOLOMON (17Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar, 19Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). The solvent mask resulting in the best electron density map was calculated assuming a solvent content of 75% for the PSI crystals. Electron density maps calculated at various levels of resolution and displayed at different contour levels were inspected on an Evans and Sutherland graphic display using the program O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowtan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Model building was also performed in O. No amino acid side chains nor phytyl side chains of the chlorophyll and phylloquinone cofactors were included in the model. In the case of the stromal subunits PsaC and PsaE (11Adman E.T. Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3801-3806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Falzone C.J. Kao Y.-H. Zhao J. Bryant D.A. Lecomte J.T.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6052-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), known structures of homologous proteins were used to aid the electron density interpretation. The present resolution and the low data:parameter ratio as well as significant errors in the initial coordinates do not allow for refinement of the structural model of PSI. All distances should consequently be understood as estimates between backbone Cα atoms. The phase information used in the calculation of the present electron density map has been provided by the multiple isomorphous replacement method including anomalous scattering (MIRAS). The low heavy atom compound concentrations used for soaking the crystals in combination with the large surface area of PSI generally lead to the formation of multiple heavy atom sites, each with a relatively low occupancy. This introduces difficulties to the identification and refinement of the heavy atom positions and their occupancies, which is crucial in obtaining optimal phase angles by the MIRAS method. Previously, major heavy atom sites were identified from isomorphous difference Patterson maps. Additional minor sites were detected from cross-phased isomorphous difference Fourier maps. The occupancies and coordinates of these sites were optimized using vector space refinement techniques as implemented in VECREF (17Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). Due to the low resolution, temperature factors of the heavy atom sites could not be refined. This heavy atom model was incorporated into MLPHARE (21.Otwinowski, Z., Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering, Wolf, W., Evans, P. R., Leslie, A. G. W., 1996, 80, 86, SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom.Google Scholar) for phase calculation. Further refinement of the heavy atom parameters could not be achieved, since occupancy optimization resulted in large parameter shifts without convergence. The calculated electron density maps were not of optimal quality. Small improvements were achieved by origin correlation refinement along the c-axis between heavy atom derivatives using the program HEAVY (22Terwilliger T.C. Eisenberg D. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1983; 39: 813-817Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and reintroducing the refined parameters into MLPHARE for phasing. (See Fig. 1 for the mean figures of merit (FOM) for acentric (black dots) and centric (white) reflections before (continuous lines) and after (dashed lines) refinement.) This procedure is seen to slightly increase the mean FOM in the case of the acentric reflections in the medium resolution shells and somewhat more in the low resolution shells. The latter results in an improved final electron density map after solvent flattening as low resolution terms strongly influence the correctness of the mask determined from the initial MIRAS electron density map. The described procedures, VECREF/MLPHARE-DM and VECREF/HEAVY/MLPHARE-DM, produce electron density maps with strong radial quality variations, the highest quality coinciding with the center of the PSI monomer. This causes the difficulties encountered in interpreting the stromal and luminal sections of PSI as well as the peripheral membrane integral regions (9Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The most significant improvement in the quality of the electron density map was, however, achieved by introducing the programs SHARP (18de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) for refinement of heavy atom parameters and phase calculation and SOLOMON (19Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) for density modification including solvent flattening. Starting with the existing heavy atom model determined from isomorphous difference Patterson maps, the analysis of the residual log likelihood gradient maps increased the number of minor sites for each derivative used. The earlier heavy atom sites nevertheless generally remained consistent with the newly optimized models (see TableII). Due to the low resolution of the diffraction data, the isotropic temperature factor of all heavy atom sites was fixed at B = 30 Å2.Table IIOverview of heavy atom refinementNo. of sitesaThe current number of sites is shown; number of sites according to previous model (9) is shown in parentheses.No. of common sitesRisobRiso = ∑h‖FPH(h) − FP(h)‖/∑hFP(h), where FPH(h) and FP(h) are derivative and native structure factor amplitudes.Phasing powercPrevious values are shown in parentheses.

Open table in a new tab By visual judgment, the electron density map, calculated with phases obtained from SHARP using five heavy atom derivatives, is generally of poorer quality than the best map resulting from phasing with MLPHARE using heavy atom models for 10 derivatives. The difference in the number of derivatives used is based on program-inherent parameter limitations in the current version of SHARP. The quantity of information introduced in MLPHARE produced a better multiple isomorphous replacement electron density map than the more accurately defined heavy atom parameters of the limited selection of derivatives used in the SHARP refinement (see Fig. 1 and Table II). The nominal mean FOM-values for both centric and acentric reflections reported by SHARP are significantly lower than those from MLPHARE, although this may be due to small differences in FOM definitions. Furthermore, SHARP determines similar average FOM values for both centric and acentric reflections, whereas centric reflections have significantly better values as reported by MLPHARE. On the other hand, comparing phasing statistics for individual derivatives indicates an overall improvement for each derivative (higher phasing power and lowerRcullis values) during refinement by SHARP, except, that is, for the platinum derivative. This confirms the improvement of the heavy atom models by using SHARP, whereas the lower quality of the MIRAS phases calculated with SHARP seems simply to be due to the smaller number of derivatives used. None of the MIRAS electron density maps allow PsaE or the second phylloquinone molecule (two previously undetected structural motifs) to be identified (Fig. 2). Comparing the SHARP and MLPHARE electron density maps, the α-helices in the former appear more detailed but less continuous, whereas the MLPHARE maps reveal more connected electron density stretches. The situation is dramatically reversed following solvent flattening by SOLOMON (19Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). The electron density map obtained by combination of MLPHARE and SOLOMON is of higher quality than that obtained with MLPHARE and DM (data not shown). Consequently, SOLOMON was used for all further solvent flattening procedures. Fig. 1,b and c, depicts the FOM and mean phase differences following solvent flattening for three procedures combining VECREF/HEAVY/MLPHARE-DM, VECREF/HEAVY/MLPHARE-SOLOMON, and SHARP-SOLOMON. Clearly, the combination SHARP-SOLOMON provided the best phases, followed by VECREF/HEAVY/MLPHARE-SOLOMON. Presumably, the more elaborately defined phase probability distributions of SHARP allow for optimal combination of phase information during solvent flattening procedures, leading finally to more accurately defined phases. Furthermore, little or no additional information is made available by phase extension to between 4.0 and 3.5 Å. The limit of resolution was therefore taken to be 4 Å. To avoid being misled by statistics, the subjective visual impression (compactness and continuity) of each electron density map was taken as the final quality criterion. An example of the variations in the quality of the electron density maps is given in Fig. 2, which shows identical sections of differently calculated electron density maps corresponding to the subunit PsaE. PSI possesses three small stromal subunits, PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE of molecular masses 8.7, 15.2, and 8.3 kDa in S. elongatus, respectively (24Mühlenhoff U. Haehnel W. Witt H.T. Herrmann R.G. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Together, they form a stromal ridge that extends ∼30 Å beyond the membrane-integral regions (Fig. 3a), as first revealed by electron microscopy studies (3Böttcher B. Gräber P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 100: 125-136Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PsaC is positioned such that the 2-fold pseudorotation axis C2(AB), which relates PsaA and PsaB, intersects the local 2-fold axis C2(C) of PsaC at an angle of 62° (cf. Fig. 6). PsaE is located adjacent to PsaC, facing away from the trimeric axis C3, whereas PsaD faces toward this axis (9Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In projection onto the a,b-plane, connecting vectors between the approximate “centers of mass” (COM) of PsaD, PsaC, and PsaE form an obtuse angle of ∼160° (Fig. 3a); the angle between vectors C3-C2(AB) and C2(AB)-PsaDCOM(C2(AB)-PsaECOM) is approximately 45° (155°). In this projection, PsaDCOM and PsaECOM are located ∼22 and ∼26 Å from PsaCCOM. Together with some loops from membrane-integral subunits, the three stromal subunits form a wide cavity, the docking site for ferredoxin and flavodoxin, as first suggested by Frommeet al. (25Fromme P. Schubert W.-D. Krauß N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and later confirmed by combined cross-linking and electron microscopy studies (26Lelong C. Boekema E.J. Kruip J. Bottin H.

The region presumed to be occupied by PsaE had been located, but an interpretation as in the case of PsaC was not possible. The current electron density map (see Figs. 2d and 5a) clearly reveals the five-stranded β-barrel of the PsaE core as well as an extended loop region directed toward the PSI core. Initially, a representative NMR model of PsaE (12Falzone C.J. Kao Y.-H. Zhao J. Bryant D.A. Lecomte J.T.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6052-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) was visually fitted into the electron density map. The structural model of PsaE fromSynechococcus sp. strain PCC7002 was then modified to reflect the sequence of S. elongatus (see Fig. 4). Following Falzone et al. (12Falzone C.J. Kao Y.-H. Zhao J. Bryant D.A. Lecomte J.T.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6052-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the β-strands are referred to as βA to βE and the connecting loops as AB to DE, Fig. 5b. An additional proline was introduced into the loop BC and a glutamine into loop DE, slightly elongating these loops. Except for the C-terminal end of βE (Val68 has been substituted by an alanine), all remaining substitutions are not located in the β-barrel, nor do they disturb the length of the loops. The C terminus of PsaE in S. elongatus and the loops BC and DE are longer than inSynechococcus sp. PCC7002; they have been modified as indicated by the electron density map (Fig. 5a).

IgA exists in monomeric and polymeric forms that function through receptors expressed on effector cells. Here, we show that IgA Fc receptor(s) (FcαR) are expressed with or without the γ chain on monocytes and neutrophils. γ-less FcαR represent a significant fraction of surface FcαR molecules even on cells overexpressing the γ chain. The FcαR-γ2 association is up-regulated by phorbol esters and interferon-γ. To characterize γ-less FcαR functionally, we generated mast cell transfectants expressing wild-type human FcαR or a receptor with a point mutation (Arg → Leu at position 209) which was unable to associate with the γ chain. Mutant γ-less FcαR bound monomeric and polymeric human IgA1 or IgA2 but failed to induce exocytosis after receptor clustering. The two types of transfectant showed similar kinetics of FcαR-mediated endocytosis; however, the endocytosis pathways of the two types of receptor differed. Whereas mutant FcαR were localized mainly in early endosomes, those containing FcαR-γ2 were found in endo-lysosomal compartments. Mutant γ-less FcαR recycled the internalized IgA toward the cell surface and protected against IgA degradation. Cells expressing the two forms of FcαR, associated or unassociated with γ chains, may thus have differential functions either by degrading IgA antibody complexes or by recycling serum IgA.

In humans, IgA is found in the systemic and mucosal compartments; it is the second most common antibody class in blood and the major immunoglobulin at mucosal surfaces (1Conley M.E. Delacroix D.L.

More IgA is produced daily than all of the other immunoglobulin classes together (3Solomon A. Cancer Markers. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1980: 57Crossref Google Scholar). In serum, IgA is mainly monomeric and has a half-life around five times shorter than that of IgG because of its fast catabolism (2Mestecky J. Russell M.W. Biochem. Soc.

Although the implications of secretory IgA in host defenses are well established (2Mestecky J. Russell M.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), much less is known about the antibody-mediated functions of serum IgA in human blood. Serum IgA has been considered an anti-inflammatory isotype capable of inhibiting several functions mediated by other isotypes including inhibition of IgG phagocytosis, bactericidal activity, oxidative burst, and cytokine release (5Van Epps D.E.

This interaction is resistant to treatment with Nonidet P-40 detergent, which contrasts with the dissociation of γ chains from FcεRI or FcγRI in certain detergents (26Pfefferkorn L.C. Yeaman G.R. J.

Geha R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8847-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This strong interaction can be explained by the presence of two oppositely charged residues (Arg+/Asp−) in the transmembrane domain of the FcαR and γ chain, respectively (28Morton H.C. van de Herik-Oudijk I.E. Vossebeld P. Snijders A. Verhoeven A.J. Capel P.J.A. van de Winkel J.G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29781-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The γ chain contains a common immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif in its cytoplasmic tail. Recently, it has been shown that signaling through FcαR-γ2 involves several tyrosine kinases including lyn, syk, and Btk (31Gulle H. Samstag A. Eibl M.M. Wolf H.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 383-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Launay P. Lehuen A. Kawakami T. Blank U. Monteiro R.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recruitment and phosphorylation of syk and Btk were modulated by stimulation with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and/or phorbol esters, indicating that activation of tyrosine kinases through FcαR depends on the priming state of the cell (32Launay P. Lehuen A. Kawakami T. Blank U. Monteiro R.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). FcR without signaling motifs in their cytoplasmic tails are associated with specialized subunits, such as γ or β chains, and depend on their specific retention motifs to be fully expressed on the cell surface (33Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In the absence of the γ chain they are degraded rapidly in the endoplasmic reticulum as in the case of FcγRIII (34Lobell R.B. Arm J.P. Raizman M.B. Austen K.F. Katz H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1207-1212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One remarkable feature of FcαR is that these receptors can be expressed fully at the surface of COS cells after transfection, without the signaling γ subunits (16Maliszewski C.R. March C.J. Schoenborn M.A. Gimpel S. Shen L. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Despite the role of the γ chain in downstream FcαR signaling (28Morton H.C. van de Herik-Oudijk I.E. Vossebeld P. Snijders A. Verhoeven A.J. Capel P.J.A. van de Winkel J.G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29781-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the FcαR could exist and function as receptors when unassociated with the γ chain (γ-less FcαR) on myeloid cells. We have identified significant amounts of γ-less FcαR in several cell types, including monocytes, neutrophils, and transfected cells overexpressing the γ chain. γ-less FcαR and FcαR-γ2 are expressed on the same cells, and this constitutes the basis for differential endocytosis pathways of IgA, in which γ-less receptors recycle IgA toward the cell surface whereas FcαR-γ2 undergo endo-lysosomal sorting for IgA degradation.

Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) (40Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J.

Human FcαR containing the R209L mutation was constructed by amplifying base pairs 591–891 of a previously described FcαR a.1 cDNA (21Patry C. Sibille Y. Lehuen A. Monteiro R.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4442-4448PubMed Google Scholar). The sense primer included the BanII restriction site at position 601 and introduced the R209L mutation (at base pairs 688–690, with CTG replacing CGC). The amplified fragment was ligated to the remainder of the NH2-terminal cDNA via the BanII restriction site. The construct was checked by sequencing as described in Ref. 21Patry C. Sibille Y. Lehuen A. Monteiro R.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4442-4448PubMed Google Scholar. The FcαR a.1, FcαR (R209L), and human γ chain (41Kuster H. Thompson H. Kinet J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6448-6452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were subcloned into pSRαNeo (kindly provided by Dr. J. Di Santo, INSERM U429) a modified version of the pcDL-SRα promoter-based expression vector (42Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RBL-2H3 cells were first transfected with 30 μg of DNA by electroporation at 250 V and 1,050 microfarads using an Easyjet+ apparatus (Eurogenetec, Seraing, Belgium), then grown under 1 mg/ml G418 selection; resistant clones were selected for FcαR expression by means of flow cytometry. One FcαR-expressing clone was chosen and cotransfected with pSRαNeo-human γ-chain (30 μg) and pSRα-Puro (4 μg) (43Roa M. Paumet F. Lemao J. David B. Blank U. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2815-2823PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface iodination with Na125I (1 mCi; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out by the lactoperoxidase method (44Goding J.W. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 2082-2088PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of FcαR, cells (107/ml) were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in PBS containing 1% digitonin (Aldrich), 0.02% sodium azide, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate, 5 mmiodoacetamide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble materials, cleared lysates were immunodepleted of FcγR by using human IgG, 32.2 and IV.3 mAb, and precipitated with test mAb as described previously (35Monteiro R.C. Cooper M.D. Kubagawa H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1764-1770PubMed Google Scholar). Bound materials were treated or not treated with N-glycanase (Genzyme), and samples were subsequently prepared for SDS-PAGE (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-684Crossref Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose Hybond-C (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) filter for 18–20 h (46Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated in blocking buffer composed of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl (TBS) containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with anti-γ (1:500) for 2 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used a secondary Ab. Filters were developed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This was carried out as described in Ref. 47Miller L. Blank U. Metzger H. Kinet J.P. Science. 1989; 244: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar. Briefly, F(ab′)2 fragments of A77 mAb or mouse IgE were labeled with Na125I using the IODO-GEN method (48Salisbury J.G. Graham J.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 106) were incubated with125I-labeled test mAb (25–35 μg/ml) for 1 h, washed in PBS and 0.1% NaN3, and then lysed in 0.5 ml of 1% digitonin buffer containing protease inhibitors as described above. After centrifugation, lysates were divided into two aliquots for 2-h incubations with either 20 μg of 4D8 anti-γ chain mAb or 50 μg of RAM Ig Ab coupled to Sepharose 4B. These amounts of antibodies had been identified as saturating concentrations for precipitation of labeled Ab complexes. The percentage of specifically precipitated counts was calculated for each Ab after subtraction of nonspecific counts obtained using either irrelevant IgG1-coupled beads or lysates that had been preincubated with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled anti-FcαR mAb (nonspecific counts were always <3%). For RBL transfectants, 3 μl of polyclonal rabbit anti-γ chain antiserum plus protein A-coupled beads were used to coprecipitate both rat and human γ chains (49Tadou G. Varin-Blank N. Jouin H. Marchand F. Weyer A. Blank U. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1993; 100: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Normal rabbit serum was used to determine background precipitation. RBL transfectants (1 × 106) were stained with 10 μl of biotinylated A77 F(ab′)2 or irrelevant IgG1 F(ab′)2fragments (at 0.1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by 10 μl of 1/50 diluted streptavidin PE (Southern Biotechnology Associates) as developing reagent. For IgA binding, cells preincubated with human IgG (10 mg/ml) to block FcγR were incubated with 10 μl of biotinylated purified IgA (0.5 mg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by streptavidin PE. For two-color immunofluorescence analysis, viable U937 cells (2 × 106), preincubated with an excess of human IgG (10 mg/ml) to block FcγR, were stained directly with 10 μl of PE-labeled A59 anti-FcαR mAb (0.1 mg/ml) or with an irrelevant PE-labeled IgG1 control for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, cells were fixed with PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS containing digitonin (10 μg/ml) for 5 min at 4 °C, and stained with anti-γ chain rabbit antiserum (10 μl at 1:100 dilution) or a control rabbit serum for 30 min at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. After washes, cells were incubated with 10 μl of FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (25 μg/ml; human- and mouse-adsorbed, purchased from Southern Biotechnology Associates) for 30 min at 4 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur apparatus (Becton Dickinson). In some experiments, cytoplasmic molecules were evaluated on cells cytospun onto glass slides, fixed, and permeabilized for 20 min at −20 °C with 95% ethanol and 5% acetic acid solution, washed, and incubated for 20 min with 4D8, A59, or control IgG1 mAb (0.05 mg/ml). FITC-labeled anti-mouse Ig Ab (0.05 mg/ml) was added as a developing reagent and mounted on coverslips. This was based on a method described previously (43Roa M. Paumet F. Lemao J. David B. Blank U. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2815-2823PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, transfectants were plated at 5 × 104 cells in 100 μl of complete DMEM in the absence of G418 and sensitized with anti-dinitrophenyl IgE Abs (1/200) or F(ab′)2 fragments of A77 mAb (0.01 mg/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in Hanks' balanced saline solution containing 1% fetal calf serum and resuspended in the same buffer containing 100 ng/ml dinitrophenyl-human serum albumin (Sigma) or F(ab′)2 fragment RAM (40 μg/ml), respectively. To determine spontaneous release, cells were incubated in the absence of Ag (for FcεRI stimulation) or with irrelevant IgG1 F(ab′)2 fragments (for FcαR stimulation). Maximal release was determined with 100 nm PMA plus 1 μmionomycin as stimulant. After incubation for 1.5 h, hexosaminidase secretion was analyzed in test supernatants by addingp-nitrophenylN-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine (1.3 mg/ml Sigma). The total cellular content of β-hexosaminidase was determined by lysis of adherent cells in 0.5% Triton X-100. Absorbance was determined at 410 nm in a microplate reader. This was performed as described elsewhere (50Harrison P.T. Davis W. Norman J.C. Hockaday A.R. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24396-24402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were incubated with 1 μg of 125I-F(ab′)2 fragments of A77 anti-FcαR mAb for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing, 10 μl of F(ab′)2 fragments of rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (1 mg/ml) was added for 30 min. Excess antibody was removed, and endocytosis was induced by incubating cells at 37 °C in RPMI 1640, 25 mm HEPES, 5% fetal calf serum for the times indicated. The reaction was stopped by placing the cells on ice. Any residual antibodies on the surface were removed by acid stripping (PBS, pH 2.5, at 4 °C for 5 min). This acid treatment routinely removes 85–90% of surface-bound anti-FcαR F(ab′)2. After pelleting, cell-associated counts were detected in a gamma counter. In recycling experiments the cells were incubated with125I-polymeric IgA1κ or 125I-Fab fragments of A77 alone for 1 h on ice, washed, and then either treated or not treated for 20 min with 0.6 mm primaquine (Sigma) before incubation at 37 °C. Nonspecific counts were obtained by preincubating cells with a 100-fold excess of nonlabeled mAb or IgA. Data are expressed as percentages of total initial cell-associated counts and presented as the means ± S.D. of at least three separate experiments. RBL transfectants were plated in the absence of G418 at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well Costar tissue culture plates. 24 h later, the cells were incubated with biotinylated,125I-labeled dimeric IgA1κ (1 μg/well) in 0.2 ml of 0.1% bovine serum albumin, DMEM at 4 °C for 1 h. The medium was removed after 1 h, and the cells were washed three times at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with streptavidin-labeled PE (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 15 min to induce receptor aggregation. After washings, cells were cultured in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 100 μg/ml unlabeled IgA1κ for the times indicated. After incubation, the medium was removed, proteins were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and acid-soluble and acid-insoluble radioactivities were counted in a gamma counter as described in Ref.51White S.

Adherent cells on glass slides were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 100 μl of 0.1 mg/ml A77 anti-FcαR F(ab′)2 fragments in PBS and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After washings, cells were incubated with 100 μl of 0.04 mg/ml RAM or FITC-coupled GAM for 30 min on ice. When indicated, cells carrying unlabeled antibodies were incubated further with 0.005 mg/ml GAR coupled to FITC to amplify aggregation. To visualize transferrin receptor-recycling vesicles, cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM for 30 min to deplete endogenous transferrin and incubated on ice with 100 nm human transferrin coupled to Cy3 (kindly provided by Dr. A. Benmerah, CJF-97-10, Necker Institute) together with anti-FcαR mAb as above. The slides were either warmed to 37 °C for various times or kept at 4 °C. Cells were washed, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and quenched twice in PBS containing 1 m glycine. For intracellular γ chain staining, cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin (Sigma) and stained with 3.5 μg/ml purified anti-γ chain polyclonal Ab plus 3.5 μg/ml GAR coupled to Texas Red. To visualize the plasma membranes, cells were stained after endocytosis for 5 min at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of wheat germ agglutinin coupled to Texas Red (38Silvain C. Patry C. Launay P. Lehuen A. Monteiro R.C. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1606-1618PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, the slides were mounted in 10% Moviol, 25% glycerol, Tris-HCl (100 mm, pH 8.5). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was carried out with a TCS4D confocal microscope based on a DM microscope interfaced with an argon/krypton laser. Simultaneous double fluorescence acquisitions were made with the 488 nm and 568 nm laser lines to excite FITC and Texas Red dyes using a 100 × oil-immersion Plan Apo objective (numerical aperture 1.4). The fluorescence was selected using appropriate double-fluorescence dichroic mirror and band-pass filters (52Saudrais C. Spehner D. de La Salle H. Bohbot A. Cazenave J.P. Goud B. Hanau D. Salamero J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2597-2607PubMed Google Scholar). Because FcαR can be fully expressed at the surface of COS cells after transfection without the signaling γ subunits (16Maliszewski C.R. March C.J. Schoenborn M.A. Gimpel S. Shen L. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we investigated whether all FcαR expressed on PMA-treated U937 cells were associated with the γ chain homodimer by means of confocal microscopy. Because γ-less and γ-associated FcαR could not initially be distinguished on the cell surface, we performed short term endocytosis of FcαR·anti-FcαR mAb complexes (FITC-labeled) to examine whether all internalized receptors colocalized with the γ chain (Texas Red-labeled) in the vesicles. As shown in Fig. 1, two types of intracellular vesicles were detected in single cells, in which FcαR was either colocalized (yellow) or not colocalized (green) with the γ chain. These results strongly suggest the existence of γ-less and γ-associated FcαR in the same cells. To investigate whether the γ-less receptor population could also be detected in detergent extracts, we performed immunodepletion experiments using digitonin-solubilized cells because the FcαR-γ2 interaction is resistant to digitonin treatment (26Pfefferkorn L.C. Yeaman G.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3228-3236PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, immunoprecipitation of surface-iodinated FcαR from blood neutrophils and PMA-treated U937 cells resulted in the appearance of the expected broad band of 55–75 kDa. Precipitation with an anti-γ chain antibody gave rise to similarly sized species. Treatment of anti-γ chain mAb-associated glycoproteins with N-glycanase resulted in 32- and 36-kDa bands that comigrated wi"

The SPR desensitizes in the continued presence of agonist, presumably via mechanisms that implicate G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins. The temporal relationship of these proposed biochemical events has never been established for any GPCR other than rhodopsin beyond the resolution provided by biochemical assays. We investigate the real-time activation and desensitization of the human SPR in live HEK293 cells using green fluorescent protein conjugates of protein kinase C, GRK2, and β-arrestin 2. The translocation of protein kinase C βII-green fluorescent protein to and from the plasma membrane in response to substance P indicates that the human SPR becomes activated within seconds of agonist exposure, and the response desensitizes within 30 s. This desensitization process coincides with a redistribution of GRK2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, followed by a robust redistribution of β-arrestin 2 and a profound change in cell morphology that occurs after 1 min of SPR stimulation. These data establish a role for GRKs and β-arrestins in homologous desensitization of the SPR and provide the first visual and temporal resolution of the sequence of events underlying homologous desensitization of a GPCR in living cells.

The substance P or neurokinin 1 receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily that regulates signaling for pain perception in both the peripheral and central nervous systems (1Otsuka M. Yoshioka K. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 229-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Its role in pain transmission has been convincingly demonstrated in animal models using genetic techniques.

Therefore, a pharmacological blockade of SPR activation or an enhancement of mechanisms that attenuate SPR signaling may ultimately lead to novel therapies for pain. The SPR is coupled to a Gq-mediated signaling cascade. Thus, the binding of SP to the receptor results in the hydrolysis of membrane phosphoinositides, the formation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, the mobilization of intracellular calcium, and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and translocation to the plasma membrane (4Weiss S.J. McKinney J.S. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1982; 206: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Hunter J.C. Goedert M. Pinnock R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Studies performed over the last several years on GPCRs such as β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and rhodopsin have proposed that agonist-dependent desensitization of GPCRs requires phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) followed by the binding of β-arrestin proteins (12Ferguson S.S.G.

The applicability of this homologous desensitization paradigm to the SPR is suggested by recent in vitro studies demonstrating that GRKs efficiently phosphorylate the human and rat SPR (15Kwatra M.M. Schwinn D.A. Schreurs J. Blank J.L. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Krause J.E. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9161-9164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nishimura K.

The goal of the present study was to ascertain the extent and kinetics of GRK and β-arrestin involvement in SPR signaling in live cells. To this end, HEK293 cells were transfected with human SPR and green fluorescent protein conjugates of PKCβII, GRK2, or β-arrestin 2. The effects of human SPR activation on the cellular distribution of these proteins were then visualized in real time by confocal microscopy. Our data demonstrate that during SP-mediated homologous desensitization of the human SPR, the translocations of GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane closely follow the activation of PKC. Interestingly, whereas redistribution of β-arrestin 2 to activated GPCRs has previously been observed (17Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), the SPR is the first GPCR whose activation led to the observable translocation of GRK2 to the plasma membrane in real time. Hence, these observations in live cells represent the first visual confirmation that the temporal sequence of biochemical events underlying homologous GPCR desensitization does indeed occur. Cell culture media and physiological buffers were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Substance P was obtained from Sigma. H332PO4 (specific activity, 8500–9120 Ci/mmol) was from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). Plasmid constructs of green fluorescent protein conjugated to PKCβII, GRK2, and β-arrestin 2 were made and characterized as described previously (17Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J.

HEK293 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1:100 (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with 5–10 μg of plasmid pcDNA1.1 containing human SPR cDNA and 1–2.5 μg of plasmid containing cDNA for either PKCβII-GFP, GRK2-GFP, or β-arrestin 2-GFP using coprecipitation with calcium phosphate as described previously (17Barak L.S.

The cells were then stimulated with 1 μm SP for various times. After this treatment, cells were washed with cold buffer and then lysed with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was centrifuged, precleared by incubating with protein A-Sepharose, and incubated for 1 h with 5 μl of a polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of human SPR (16Nishimura K. Warabi K. Roush E.D. Frederick J. Schwinn D.A. Kwatra M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mixture was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation, washed with lysis buffer containing 1m NaCl, resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (2% SDS, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue), and the phosphorylated proteins were visualized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Transfected cells were split into 35-mm plastic dishes containing a centered, 1-cm, glass-bottomed well (MaTEK, Inc., Ashland, MA). Cells were placed in 1 ml of minimum essential medium buffered with 20 mm HEPES and treated with 100 μl of 1 μm SP in medium. Images were collected with a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM-410), and relative intensities were calculated from 8-bit pixel values using Scion Image for the PC (Release 2). Net translocation was calculated by subtracting the average background intensity in the cytoplasm from the membrane intensity. Images were printed using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. The translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane occurs upon agonist stimulation of Gq-coupled GPCRs (19Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows how the temporal distribution of PKCβII-GFP changes in HEK293 cells upon activation of SPRs by 100 nm SP. As seen in Fig. 1, the increase in PKCβII-GFP fluorescence at the plasma membrane, which separates the two cells, becomes evident within 3 s. This redistribution of PKC reflects SPR activation, which probably occurs even more rapidly. However, our ability to measure shorter time intervals is limited because there is image degradation upon employing more rapid scanning rates. As can be observed in Fig. 1, PKC translocation remains stable for 20–30 s, begins to wane after 30 s, and disappears by 60–90 s. To demonstrate that the reversibility of PKC translocation upon SPR activation is consistent with receptor desensitization and is not simply a generalized waning of the PKC response, cells were also exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This compound persistently activates PKC by a receptor-independent mechanism (20Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4217) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that the exposure of the cells to 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate results in a translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane that shows no sign of decreasing even after 5 min. These data indicate that the waning of PKC upon SPR activation is due to an upstream event which probably occurs at the level of the receptor. A similar conclusion was reached in a recent study by Feng et al. (19Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10755-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It was found that stimulation of Gq-linked angiotensin or endothelin receptors also produces a single transient pulse of PKC translocation. However, the sequential activation of angiotensin receptors followed after a few minutes by the activation of endothelin receptors produced a second independent pulse of PKC translocation. This indicated that the desensitization occurred at the level of the receptor itself and was not due to the desensitization of downstream Gq-mediated signaling. The 60-s time period after SPR activation thus defines a window in which changes in the distributions of the cellular proteins responsible for homologous SPR desensitization should become apparent.Figure 2Activation of PKCβII by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was added to the cell media at time 0 (left panel), and the redistribution of PKCβII-GFP was followed by confocal microscopy. The redistribution of PKCβII to the plasma membrane shows no signs of reversal up to 5 min (right panel).

Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12316-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). If GRK2 plays a major role in initiating human SPR desensitization, then its physical translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane should be apparent within the temporal window defined by the reversible translocation of SP-activated PKC. To investigate the kinetics of GRK2 behavior during SP stimulation, GRK2-GFP was coexpressed along with the human SPR in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3). Previous studies have documented that GRK2-GFP is a functional kinase because it phosphorylates rhodopsin in both a Gβγ-independent and -dependent manner (18Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12316-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), facilitates β2AR internalization (18Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12316-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and phosphorylates β2AR in intact cells. 2L. S. Barak, S. S. G. Ferguson, and M. G. Caron, unpublished results. As seen in Fig. 3, the increase in fluorescence from the plasma membrane after SP treatment reflects the agonist-dependent translocation of GRK2-GFP. Using 3-s scanning intervals, it is seen that GRK2 accumulates at the membrane interface between two cells within 6–9 s of agonist treatment. This translocation peaks at between 15 and 21 s and wanes thereafter but does not entirely disappear, even after 1 min. These results visually demonstrate that human SPR activation recruits GRK2 to the plasma membrane during the period in which the receptor desensitizes. These data represent the first demonstration in living cells of a physical translocation of GRK2 to the plasma membrane after GPCR activation. Because GRK2 translocates to the plasma membrane after SPR stimulation, we examined whether this event leads to receptor phosphorylation. HEK293 cells expressing human SPR were labeled with32Pi, and the receptor was immunoprecipitated from control and SP-treated cells. The results, which are shown in Fig. 4, indicate that SP causes a rapid phosphorylation of the receptor within 30 s of SP exposure. Thus, SP-induced translocation of GRK2 correlates with SP-induced phosphorylation of the SPR. A similarly rapid (t½< 1 min) SP-dependent phosphorylation of the human SPR also occurs in Chinese hamster ovary cells that stably express the receptor. 3E. D. Roush and M. M. Kwatra, unpublished results. Fig. 5 shows the redistribution of β-arrestin in a representative cell containing both β-arrestin 2-GFP and the human SPR in response to SP. The cell cytoplasm acts as a reservoir for β-arrestins (17Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This can be observed in the cell shown in the top left panel of Fig. 5as a homogenous distribution of β-arrestin 2-GFP fluorescence. The addition of SP at time 0 to the surrounding media results in an enhancement of fluorescence at the cell margins from β-arrestin 2-GFP translocation that is apparent by 30 s and is delayed relative to PKCβII and GRK2 translocations. β-Arrestin 2 translocation does not peak for 60–120 s after SP exposure and remains localized at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the data for Fig. 5 show that after a minute of SPR stimulation, the cell morphology begins to change dramatically. We visually document in real time a rapid activation and desensitization of the human substance P receptor. The results indicate that SPR desensitization coincides with the active recruitment of GRK2 to the plasma membrane and phosphorylation of the receptor, followed by the recruitment of β-arrestin 2 to the plasma membrane. Thus, these data establish a role for GRKs and β-arrestins in the homologous desensitization of SPRs. Moreover, these results represent the first direct confirmation in whole cells that the putative sequence of biochemical events underlying homologous GPCR desensitization (receptor activation and GRK-mediated phosphorylation followed by the binding of β-arrestins) actually occurs as postulated from a variety of in vitro and whole cell studies. Fig. 6summarizes the temporal relationship of SPR activation and the redistribution of GRKs and β-arrestins. Studies on the mechanism of homologous desensitization of GPCRs using the β2AR as a model have shown that increases in plasma membrane GRK activity occur after agonist treatment (22Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 23Strasser R.H. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6362-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These findings did not necessarily require that a simultaneous recruitment of GRK from the cytosol also occurs. A significant finding of the present study is that a sustained physical translocation of GRK2 occurs with agonist stimulation of the human SPR. This type of GRK behavior in the presence of the substance P receptor has been suggested by immunochemical studies using fixed and extracted neuronal cells (24McConalogue K. Corvera C.U. Gamp P.D. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2305-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similar studies using antibodies to assess GRK2 distribution in fixed HEK293 cells also seem to indicate that GRK2 is recruited to membranes during the early stages of desensitization and β2AR endocytosis (25Ruiz-Gomez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, we have been unable to demonstrate any persistent observable physical translocation of GRK2-GFP to activated β2AR, despite results demonstrating that overexpressed GRK2-GFP enhances β2AR phosphorylation and sequestration. Similarly, we have been unable to document a physical translocation of GRK2-GFP to other types of GPCRs including the angiotensin II type IA receptor. 4L. S. Barak, unpublished data. Thus, our finding of an observable physical GRK2-GFP translocation upon SPR stimulation is intriguing. A potential explanation for this may follow from the observation that the human SPR is an excellent substrate of GRK2. It can be nearly maximally phosphorylated in the absence of Gβγ with aK m of 6 nm (16Nishimura K. Warabi K. Roush E.D. Frederick J. Schwinn D.A. Kwatra M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the β2AR occurs with aK m of 49 nm and requires Gβγ (26Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15412-15418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of GRK2 for the β2AR is over 100-fold lower than the 0.3 nm K d observed in vitro for β-arrestin 2 binding to the receptor (27Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Therefore, for some GPCRs, β-arrestin may normally prevent persistent GRK/receptor interactions by displacing the kinase from the receptor, but GRK may remain at the membrane upon activation of GPCRs for which it has high affinity. This interpretation of the results also support previous observations that GRKs facilitate but are not absolutely necessary for β2AR endocytosis (28Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). An interesting observation made here is that SP causes a profound change in cell shape. This membrane remodeling appears to be more pronounced at the free surfaces of the cells, as shown in Fig. 7. Although the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon remains obscure, it may involve direct interactions of SP or GRK2 and tubulin (18Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G.

Steward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate that the observed SP-induced changes in cell morphology may be due to the SPR's high affinity for GRK2 (16Nishimura K. Warabi K. Roush E.D. Frederick J. Schwinn D.A. Kwatra M.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1192-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which would keep it localized on the membrane, where it can phosphorylate tubulin (18Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12316-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas a role of the SPR in chemotaxis has been reported previously (30Parenti A. Amerini S. Ledda F. Maggi C.A. Ziche M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 353: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Kahler C.M. Sitte B.A. Reinisch N. Wiedermann C.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 249: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), additional studies are needed to delineate the mechanism by which SP induces changes in cell shape. In summary, the present study visually illustrates the kinetic behavior of GRK2 and β-arrestin 2 during homologous desensitization of the human substance P receptor. The data provide direct evidence that the sequence of biochemical events proposed for homologous GPCR desensitization actually occurs in live cells. Moreover, the rapid but persistent membrane recruitment of GRK2 by the SPR suggests that the kinase may be involved in cell regulatory processes other than receptor desensitization. We thank Drs. Eric D. Roush and Jie Zhang for helpful discussions and Susan R. S. Tumey for editorial assistance."

The transglutaminase (TGase) 1 and 3 enzymes use the SPR1 proteins as complete substrates in vitro but in different ways: head domain A sequences at the amino terminus were used preferentially for cross-linking by TGase 3, whereas those in head domain B sequences were used for cross-linking by TGase 1. The TGase 2 enzyme cross-linked SPR1 proteins poorly. Together with our data base of 141 examples of in vivo cross-links between SPRs and loricrin, this means that both TGase 1 and 3 are required for cross-linking SPR1 proteins in epithelia in vivo. Double in vitro cross-linking experiments suggest that oligomerization of SPR1 into large polymers can occur only by further TGase 1 cross-linking of an initial TGase 3 reaction. Accordingly, we propose that TGase 3 first cross-links loricrin and SPRs together to form small interchain oligomers, which are then permanently affixed to the developing CE by further cross-linking by the TGase 1 enzyme.

Indeed, multiple adjacent residues were often used simultaneously on the same protein to form a complex interchain, and perhaps intrachain, cross-linked network (3Robinson N.A. Lapec S. Welter J.F.

Marekov L.N. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Second, the SPRs were found to be cross-linked to many protein partners, and indeed, they were consistently found to function as cross-bridgers between themselves or between loricrin, involucrin, etc. (4Steinert P.M. Candi E. Kartasova T. Marekov L.N. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 5Steinert P.M. Kartasova T. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11758-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fourth, as initially suggested from expression studies by earlier investigators, our sequencing data directly revealed that the amounts of SPRs present in the CEs from various tissues varied widely; while human foreskin epidermal keratinocyte CEs contained about 5% SPRs (2Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the CEs of the mouse forestomach contained about 22% SPRs (5Steinert P.M. Kartasova T. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11758-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Further modeling analyses revealed that the amounts of SPRs in the epidermal CEs from trunk, lip, and footpad correlate well with the degree of physical and mechanical trauma to which the tissues are normally subjected (5Steinert P.M. Kartasova T. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11758-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, we have proposed that cross-bridging SPRs play an important role as modulators of the biomechanical properties of the CEs and the entire epithelium in which they are expressed (5Steinert P.M. Kartasova T. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11758-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In order to further explore these functions of the SPRs, we need to be able to express large quantities of the proteins for study. Since their cross-bridging role is mediated to a substantial degree through TGase cross-linking, we also need to know which enzymes are responsible for their cross-linking in vivo and how this is done. In an initial study, we described the preparation and some properties of a member of the human SPR2 class, and showed that it is cross-linked almost entirely by the TGase 3 enzyme in vitro and in vivo (32Tarcsa E. Candi E. Kartasova T. Idler W.W. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23297-23303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have extended this work to the study of a member of the human SPR1 class. We show here that its cross-linking is much more complex, since it requires at least two TGases (3 and 1) operating in a sequential manner using different Gln residues for cross-linking to its partners as seen in vivo. A full-length cDNA clone encoding human SPR1 (clone 15B of Ref. 10Kartasova T. van de Putte P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2195-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was obtained as a generous gift from C. Backendorf. Following the addition of appropriate linkers, it was inserted into the pET-11a bacterial expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and transformed into the host Escherichia coli B strain BL 21/DE3 (Novagen). Protein expression was induced in the presence or absence ofl-[35S]cysteine (2 μCi/ml) as described previously (32Tarcsa E. Candi E. Kartasova T. Idler W.W. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol.

Fresh or previously frozen pellets of bacteria were lysed and dialyzed against several changes of 100 volumes of 25 mm sodium citrate (pH 3.6), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors as described (32Tarcsa E.

While most of the bacterial proteins precipitated, the SPR1 protein remained soluble. Purification to homogeneity was achieved using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography system on a 0.5 × 5 cm Mono-S column equilibrated in the citrate buffer with a 0–1.0 mNaCl gradient and was eluted with 0.18 m salt. The fractions were analyzed on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) with Coomassie stain or by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody broadly reactive against both mouse and human SPR1 proteins (14Kartasova T.

The enhanced chemiluminescence detection was performed with the Super Signal CL-HRP Substrate System (Pierce). Alternatively, the SPR1 proteins were monitored by autoradiography. Mouse primary keratinocytes were grown to confluency in low calcium (0.05 mm) medium. After 6 days, they were transferred to medium containing high Ca2+ (1.4 mm), 10 nm staurosporin (to induce SPR1 expression (34Stanwell C. Denning M.F. Rutberg S.E. Cheng C. Yuspa S.H. Dlugosz A.A. J.

Billedeau R.J. Farmer W. DeYoung L. Krantz A. Pliura D.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 701-706PubMed Google Scholar) (Syntex Research), and 0.5 μC/ml [35S]cysteine. After 24 h, the cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed by polytron homogenization, and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The cytosol was then dialyzed against the citrate buffer used above, under which conditions the bulk of the keratin proteins precipitated, leaving the SPR1a/b proteins highly enriched. Their final purification was done following the method for the bacterial expressed proteins, and the proteins were eluted by 0.2m NaCl. Three TGase enzymes were used. Human full-length TGase 1 was expressed in baculovirus, and the particulate fraction containing the unprocessed full-length but active TGase 1 form was isolated as described (36Candi E. Melino G. Lahm A. Ceci R. Rossi A. Kim I.G. Ciani B. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13693-13702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This has a specific activity of about 6 pmol of putrescine incorporation into succinylated casein/h/pmol of TGase 1 protein (36Candi E. Melino G. Lahm A. Ceci R. Rossi A. Kim I.G. Ciani B. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13693-13702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), as measured using 14C-putrescine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; specific activity, 118 mCi/mmol) and remains fully active for at least 1 day. A typical yield was 5–10 nmol of TGase 1/liter of insect cell culture medium. We also isolated the several TGase 1 isoforms present in the cytosolic and membrane-bound compartments of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) grown in high Ca2+ medium in the presence of [35S]methionine for 4 days after reaching confluency, exactly as described previously (37Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 38Steinert P.M. Chung S.-I. Kim S.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These included the membrane-bound full-length 106-kDa enzyme with a specific activity of about 5 (as assayed using the above units); the 67/33/10-kDa complex released from membranes by use of Triton X-100 with a specific activity of about 1000; the cytosolic full-length enzyme with a specific activity of about 50; the cytosolic 67/33-kDa complex with a specific activity of about 500; and the cytosolic 67-kDa form with a specific activity of about 250. We have noted that several of these isoforms begin to lose activity at 4 °C within about 6 h of isolation (37Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 38Steinert P.M. Chung S.-I. Kim S.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), presumably because of unfolding and/or destabilization (36Candi E. Melino G. Lahm A. Ceci R. Rossi A. Kim I.G. Ciani B. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13693-13702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The established method of using 14C-iodoacetamide for measurement of TGase 1 molar amounts recovered in each culture experiment takes about 1 day (39Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and thus to perform experiments using constant molar amounts of enzyme isoforms is problematic because of loss of enzyme activity. However, we have found that when NHEK cells are cultured under consistent conditions, the amounts of [35S]methionine specific activity incorporated into the TGase 1 isoforms (as measured after iodoacetamide titrations) are reproducible and are 21 ± 2 dpm/pmol for the cytosolic 67-kDa form and 40 ± 4 dpm/pmol for all other active forms. (This is to be expected based on the methionine contents (37Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18026-18035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).) Accordingly, we used the amount of 35S label to estimate the molar amount of each TGase 1 isoform recovered from fast protein liquid chromatography columns. In a typical culture of normal human epidermal keratinocytes in a 100-mm dish, we recovered 100–200 pmol of TGase 1, or 15–100 pmol of each of the above membrane-bound or cytosolic isoforms. Guinea Pig Liver TGase 2 Was Obtained Commercially (Sigma). TGase 3 proenzyme, which has no measurable activity, was isolated and purified from guinea pig skin. It was activated by dispase as described previously (40Kim H.-C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.C. Girard J.E. Folk J.E. Chung S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount used for reactions was quantitated by amino acid analysis. For in vitrocross-linking studies using the SPR1 proteins as complete TGase substrates and measurement of isodipeptide cross-link formation, the purified SPRs were equilibrated into a buffer of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Reactions contained 10 μg of 35S-labeled recombinant human or native mouse SPR1 proteins (about 7500 dpm) and about 12.5 pmol of TGase enzyme (∼500 nm enzyme concentration; 250–500 dpm) in a 25-μl volume. Reactions were initiated by the addition of Ca2+ to the mixture (5 mm final concentration) and incubated at 37 °C. Timed aliquots of 1.5 μl each were removed and subjected to total enzymic digestion for measurement of the amount of cross-link formed during the reactions (41Hohl D. Lichti U. Mehrel T. Turner M.L. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6626-6636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, the total reactions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–20% gradient gels, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by autoradiography. In preparative experiments, 100 μg of unlabeled recombinant human SPR1 were reacted in a volume 250 μl. In this case, we used the baculovirus membrane-bound full-length TGase 1 form and activated TGase 3 at concentrations of 700 nm for 18 h. Experiments showed that the cross-linking had proceeded to completion (see Fig. 3). We also performed a preparative experiment with the high specific activity keratinocyte membrane-bound 67/33/10-kDa isoform at 50 nm enzyme concentration, a reaction that was completed in 2 h. Kinetic constants of the three TGases were determined for the recombinant human SPR1 protein exactly as described before (32Tarcsa E. Candi E. Kartasova T. Idler W.W. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J.

The concentrations and purity of the purified SPR1 proteins and TGase enzymes were determined by amino acid analysis. Uncross-linked or cross-linked SPR1 proteins were digested with trypsin (1:30 by weight; Sigma; sequencing grade) for 6 h at 37 °C, and the peptides were resolved on a Phenomex ODS reverse phase HPLC column (2.1 × 250 mm) containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid and with a gradient of 5–65% acetonitrile over 70 min (32Tarcsa E.

In the case of the reactions with the TGase 3 enzyme, or TGase 3 followed by TGase 1, peptides were poorly resolved due to extensive cross-linking; in these experiments, 1-min fractions were collected across the peak for sequencing (32Tarcsa E.

Recently, we described the preparation of a recombinant human SPR2 protein and demonstrated that it is a favored substrate of the TGase 3 enzyme in vitro and in vivo (32Tarcsa E. Candi E.

In the present study, we have repeated these experiments using recombinant human and native mouse SPR1 proteins. We show here that both the TGase 3 and 1 enzymes are likely to be essential for SPR1 cross-linking in vivo, and in this consecutive order of reaction. Following expression in bacteria using the pET11a system, the human SPR1 protein was enriched from bacterial lysates by dialysis into 25 mm citrate buffer, pH 3.6 (in which it was very soluble), and purified by chromatography on a Mono-S fast protein liquid chromatography column (Fig. 1). The maximal yields were of the order of 2–5 mg/liter, typical of the CE proteins loricrin (33Candi E. Melino G. Mei G. Tarcsa E. Chung S.-I. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2105620363,"To analyze the role of glucose trimming and reglucosylation in the binding of substrate proteins to calnexin in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of living cells, we made use of the thermosensitive vesicular stomatitis virus tsO45 glycoprotein (G protein). At nonpermissive temperature the G protein failed to fold completely and remained bound to calnexin. When the cells were shifted to permissive temperature, complete folding occurred accompanied by glucosidase-mediated elimination of calnexin-G protein complexes. If release from calnexin was blocked during the temperature shift by inhibiting the glucosidases, folding occurred, albeit at a reduced rate. In contrast, when unfolded by a shift from permissive to nonpermissive temperature, the G protein was reglucosylated rapidly and became capable of rebinding to calnexin. The rate at which calnexin binding occurred showed a 20-min delay that was explained by accumulation of the G protein in calnexin-free exit sites of the ER. These contained the glucosyltransferase responsible for reglucosylation of misfolded glycoproteins but had little or no calnexin. After unfolding and reglucosylation, the G proteins moved slowly from these structures back to the ER where they reassociated with the chaperone. Taken together, these results in live cells fully supported the lectin-only model of calnexin function.

It was proposed that calnexin is part of a molecular chaperone cycle that includes three accessory factors: glucosidases I, II, and a glucosyltransferase (UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase) (GT) (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Williams D.B.

According to the model, binding and release of newly synthesized glycoproteins from calnexin are regulated by these enzymes. GT, a soluble lumenal enzyme, was thought to serve as the folding sensor because it was known to reglucosylate high mannose glycans only on glycoproteins with nonnative conformations (4Sousa M.C.

To examine the connection among folding, reglucosylation, and calnexin binding in situ, we made use of a mutant glycoprotein, the glycoprotein of tsO45 vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV G protein), which has a thermoreversible folding defect (14Lodish H.F. Kong N. Virology. 1983; 125: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Gallione C.J. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 374-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Balch W.E. Elliott M.M.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1957-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We induced folding and misfolding of this G protein in the ER by shifting cells between the permissive and the nonpermissive temperatures and followed the removal and readdition of glucose residues to the N-linked glycans as well as binding and release from calnexin. The results confirmed the steps in the proposed calnexin cycle and provided additional information about the timing and cellular location of these events.RESULTSVSV G protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein of 67 kDa with a short cytoplasmic tail (21Rose J.K. Gallione C.J. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 519-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its ectodomain is translocated cotranslationally into the ER where the addition of twoN-linked glycans, the formation of multiple intrachain disulfide bonds, and homotrimerization occur (22Rothman J.E. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1977; 269: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 23Machamer C.E. Doms R.W. Bole D.G. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Folding is assisted by two chaperones, BiP at early stages and calnexin at later stages (23Machamer C.E. Doms R.W. Bole D.G. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6879-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the tsO45 strain, the G protein is temperature-sensitive for folding because of the presence of a point mutation in the ectodomain (21Rose J.K. Gallione C.J. J. Virol. 1981; 39: 519-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the protein folds normally at 30 °C, it fails at 40 °C to acquire a full set of disulfide bonds and remains associated with BiP and calnexin (23Machamer C.E. Doms R.W. Bole D.G. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6879-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hammond C. Helenius A.

At the nonpermissive temperature, 66% of the glycans contain a single terminal glucose residue that is turning over in a process catalyzed by the enzymes glucosidase II and GT (27Suh P. Bergmann J.E. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At the permissive temperature of 30 °C, the native conformation is formed rapidly, and the protein is transported to the Golgi complex and beyond. As long as the protein is in the ER, the transition between the folded and unfolded states can be brought about simply by raising or lowering the temperature of incubation (28de Silva A. Balch W.E. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).The effects of temperature on tsO45 G protein folding and calnexin binding are shown in Fig. 1. Infected cells were pulse labeled at 30 °C with [35S]cysteine and methionine, and the G protein immunoprecipitated using anti-VSV antibodies and I-14, a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody to epitope B2 of the G protein (29Lefrancois L. Lyles D.S. Virology. 1982; 121: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The precipitates were analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. The band marked ox. G indicates the position of the fully oxidized G protein; red. G marks the reduced form. Incompletely oxidized folding intermediates are visible as a smear above the fully oxidized protein (23Machamer C.E. Doms R.W. Bole D.G. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6879-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal I-14 against the B2 epitope recognized only the fully oxidized forms of tsO45 G protein. This was consistent with previous observations with wild-type G protein (29Lefrancois L. Lyles D.S. Virology. 1982; 121: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this case the B2 epitope appears after full oxidation but before trimer formation (23Machamer C.E. Doms R.W. Bole D.G. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6879-6883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Doms R.W. Ruusala A. Machamer C. Helenius J. Helenius A. Rose J.K. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because I-14 did not precipitate the incompletely oxidized tsO45 G proteins, nor, as seen in Fig. 1B, the misfolded tsO45 G protein produced at the nonpermissive temperature, it could be used as a convenient indicator for tsO45 G protein folding.A pulse-chase approach was used to assess the effect of temperature on folding and calnexin binding of tsO45 G protein. Cells were infected with tsO45 VSV at 30 °C for 3.5 h, starved for cysteine and methionine for 30 min, pulse labeled for 2 min at 30 °C with35S-labeled cysteine and methionine, and chased at either 30 or 40 °C with an excess of unlabeled cysteine and methionine. Cycloheximide was added during the chase period to prevent further protein synthesis. Samples were removed at various times of chase, alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide, and lysed. Postnuclear supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-VSV, anti-calnexin, or I-14. After separation by SDS-PAGE, precipitated proteins were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager.At the permissive temperature of 30 °C, the tsO45 G protein folded with a t1/2 of approximately 7 min judging by precipitation with I-14 (Fig. 1C). By 50 min of chase, nearly all (<95%) of the labeled G protein molecules had assumed a structure recognized by I-14. At 40 °C, tsO45 G protein remained as a heterogeneous, partially aggregated mixture of incompletely folded proteins (20Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Except for a faint background that decreased with time (Fig. 1, B and C), the G protein was not immunoprecipitated by I-14. The tsO45 G protein was not degraded during the period examined as precipitation with anti-VSV antibodies showed that the level of the G protein was constant at either temperature (Fig. 1B). A second round of precipitation with the antibodies failed to bring down appreciable amounts of VSV G protein, indicating that the precipitations were essentially quantitative (Fig. 1B, IP Control).Calnexin Binding to tsO45 VSV G ProteinTo characterize the interaction of VSV G protein with calnexin during the chase, samples from the lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody to calnexin. After separation by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B), the amount of coprecipitating G protein was quantified by densitometry (Fig. 1D). Directly after the pulse, some VSV G protein was already bound to calnexin at both temperatures. At 30 °C, the amount of VSV G protein bound to calnexin peaked at 5 min of chase and declined gradually as folding progressed (Fig. 1D). At 40 °C, it increased gradually with time, consistent with the observation by Suh et al. (27Suh P. Bergmann J.E. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that the fraction of monoglucosylated glycans in the misfolded G protein keeps increasing with time at nonpermissive temperature.Typically, the fraction coprecipitating with calnexin was 10–15% of total labeled VSV G protein. Only 66% of the glycans are monoglucosylated at any given time (27Suh P. Bergmann J.E. Gabel C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which may partially account for this relatively low level of binding. Proteins that have a glucose on only one of the two glycans are so weakly bound to calnexin that the complexes do not withstand these immunoprecipitation and washing conditions (7Cannon K.S. Hebert D.N. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14280-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Effects of Glucosidase InhibitorsInhibitors of ER glucosidases I and II prevent the trimming of glucoses from the coreN-linked oligosaccharides and thus inhibit the interaction of newly synthesized glycoproteins with calnexin (5Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 30Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In the present studies we used N-butyl-1-deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) as the inhibitor because when added to live cells, it inactivates the ER glucosidases in 2–5 min. 2K. S. Cannon and A. Helenius, unpublished observations. When NB-DNJ was present 30 min before and throughout a pulse-chase experiment, the efficiency of tsO45 VSV G protein folding at 30 °C to the I-14-precipitable form dropped to 20% of control (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar to wild type (25Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), efficient folding of the ts045 G protein was dependent on the removal of glucose residues and thus on the involvement of the calnexin cycle for optimal folding.Figure 2Interaction with calnexin improves the folding of tsO45 G protein. Panel A, the glucosidase inhibitor NB-DNJ was applied to tsO45 VSV-infected cells for 30 min before and throughout the pulse-chase experiment. After a 2-min pulse with [35S]Promix and chase with cold cysteine and methionine for the indicated times, cells were lysed in 2% CHAPS and HBS and immunoprecipitated with I-14 or anti-VSV. Panel B, VSV G protein bands were measured by densitometry and graphed as a percentage of the maximum G protein recognized by I-14.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine what would happen if the inhibitor was added when VSV G protein had already been trimmed to the monoglucosylated form and was associated with calnexin, cells infected with tsO45 VSV were pulsed for 5 min and chased at the nonpermissive temperature for 10 min. NB-DNJ was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. The cells were then shifted to the permissive temperature to initiate folding, and samples were removed for I-14 and anti-calnexin immunoprecipitation at various times.In the absence of inhibitor, the shift down resulted in a small transient increase in calnexin binding during the first 10 min followed by a decrease in the next 10 min. The I-14 precipitations (Fig. 3C) showed that folding of VSV G protein was completed 10–20 min after shift down (t1/2 about 5 min). The I-14 epitope appeared faster than during normal folding at 30 °C, consistent with the suggestion that tsO45 G protein was already partially folded at 40 °C (26de Silva A. Braakman I. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Figure 3Removal of the glucose residues is necessary for release from calnexin but not for folding of G protein. Panel A, labeled tsO45 G protein was accumulated in the ER by pulsing and chasing cells at 40 °C for 20 min. NB-DNJ was added midway through the chase period and allowed to act for 10 min before cells were shifted to 30 °C to initiate folding. Samples were removed at various times after the shift. Postnuclear lysates from each time point were immunoprecipitated and the amount of G protein quantified by densitometry and graphed relative to the maximum amount recognized by anti-CNX (panel B) or I-14 (panel C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When NB-DNJ was present during the shift down, tsO45 G protein was not released from calnexin (Fig. 3B). After a small initial increase in binding similar to control cells, the amount of calnexin-bound G protein remained virtually unchanged. Folding of tsO45 G protein was as efficient as in the control samples. However, as shown in Fig. 3C, it was considerably slower, taking place with at1/2 of about 15 min.Thus, the results showed that when ER glucosidases were inhibited during the chase, VSV G protein was trapped in calnexin-bound complexes. This indicated that in living cells, glucosidases are needed not only to generate binding-competent trimming intermediates but also to release substrate glycoproteins from calnexin. The effect on the folding rate implied that if VSV G protein was unable to associate with calnexin at all, its folding efficiency was quite low. On the other hand, if binding was allowed but release was blocked, the folding proceeded efficiently but slowly. Interestingly, in the latter case the folding of the whole pool of G protein was delayed uniformly, although at any given time only a fraction of G protein was actually bound to calnexin in immunoprecipitable stable complexes. This implied that during normal folding, extensive interactions occur between calnexin and the entire G protein pool.Unfolding Triggers ReglucosylationThe thermosensitive nature of tsO45 G protein allowed us to examine what happens when a properly folded glycoprotein misfolds in the ER. We used a temperature shift up protocol in the presence of two inhibitors, brefeldin A (BFA) and deoxymannojirimycin. BFA was necessary to prevent transport of folded G protein from the ER to the Golgi complex and beyond (31Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 899-902Crossref Google Scholar). Deoxymannojirimycin was added to prevent trimming ofN-linked glycans by Golgi mannosidases that are transported to the ER as a side effect of BFA treatment (32Doms R.W. Russ G. Yewdell J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We found in preliminary experiments that without added deoxymannojirimycin, the glycans on the G protein were reglucosylated poorly. This is consistent with reports that GT does not reglucosylate glycoproteins efficiently with glycans that have less than seven mannoses in vitro(4Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).Cells infected with ts045 were pulse labeled and chased at the permissive temperature for 1 h to allow folding and release of the majority of G protein from calnexin. The cells were then shifted to the nonpermissive temperature, and incubation was continued for another hour. As shown schematically in Fig. 4A, samples were removed at the end of the pulse (sample 1), after 1 h at 30 °C (sample 2), after 2 h at 30 °C (sample 3), or after 1 h at 30 °C followed by 1 h at 40 °C (sample 4). The folding state of VSV G protein was examined in each sample (Fig. 4B), and the amount of calnexin-bound G protein was determined by coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 4D).Figure 4Unfolding of VSV G protein leads to reglucosylation and rebinding to calnexin. Panel A, at 4 h postinfection, tsO45 VSV-infected cells were pulsed for 10 min at 30 °C with [35S]Promix and chased for 60 min with unlabeled cysteine and methionine in the presence of cycloheximide. Cells were incubated for 30 min before and throughout the pulse and chase with 0.5 m deoxymannojirimycin. BFA was present at 5 μg/ml throughout the pulse and chase. After 60 min of chase some cells were kept at 30 °C, and the remainder were shifted to 40 °C. Chase was then continued for an additional 60 min. Samples were removed as indicated, lysed, and immunoprecipitated. Panel B, the amount of folded G protein at each time point was measured by I-14 immunoprecipitation and densitometry. Panel C, after immunoprecipitation, the glycosylation state of N-linked glycans was determined using jack bean α-mannosidase (α-Man) digestion. The enzyme accentuates the molecular weight difference between glycans with (Glc1) and without (Glc0) terminal glucose residues as illustrated. Panel D, the amount of calnexin-associated G protein was determined by coprecipitation with anti-calnexin antibodies and densitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Virtually all G protein molecules folded to the I-14-positive form within 60 min at the permissive temperature (Fig. 4B, samples 1–3). There was a corresponding decrease in the amount of G protein bound to calnexin (Fig. 4D, samples 1–3). After the shift to nonpermissive temperature, VSV G protein lost its folded structure, was no longer immunoprecipitated by I-14 (Fig. 4B, sample 4), and rebound to calnexin (Fig. 4D, sample 4). Unfolding of a protein that had previously folded and been released resulted in binding to calnexin a second time.An α-mannosidase assay (5Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 30Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) was used to test whether the rebinding of G protein to calnexin involved reglucosylation, as predicted by the model. The assay took advantage of the differential susceptibility ofN-linked glycans to digestion with the exomannosidase depending on whether they contain a terminal glucose residue or not (see Fig. 4C, right). Those glycans that contain a single terminal glucose residue (Glc1) have, at most, five hexoses that can be cleaved by this mannosidase. Glycans without a terminal glucose residue (Glc0) have up to eight mannose residues that can be removed. Digestion thus accentuates the difference in the molecular weight between glycoproteins that have Glc1 and Glc0 chains so that they can be resolved on SDS-PAGE. (Fig. 4C, compare samples 1 and 2). VSV G protein has only two N-glycans, so although the molecular weight differences were not large, they were clearly detectable (Fig. 4C).At the end of the pulse, when G protein was bound to calnexin, mannosidase treatment induced only a small shift in the position of the G protein band (Fig. 4C, sample 1; see marker Glc1). After 60 min of chase, a large portion of the G protein displayed an accentuated shift (see marker Glc0). However, after an additional hour at the nonpermissive temperature, the amount of Glc0 decreased, and Glc1 increased, indicating that reglucosylation had occurred (sample 4). Quantification of the amount of G protein in each lane showed that little or no protein degradation occurred in the course of this experiment. We concluded that VSV G protein was reglucosylated when misfolding was induced by a shift from the permissive to the nonpermissive temperature. This explained why rebinding to calnexin occurred.We next examined the rates at which unfolding, reglucosylation, and rebinding to calnexin occur upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 5). Unfolding, measured by loss of I-14 recognition, occurred rapidly after the temperature shift (t1/2 = 3 min; Fig. 5). The conversion from the Glc0 to the Glc1 form of G protein had similar kinetics, indicating that GT recognized and modified the G protein as soon as it unfolded. When the amount of G protein associated with calnexin was analyzed, bimodal kinetics were reproducibly observed; a rapid initial phase followed by a slower second phase. This indicated that the cells contained two pools of G protein which differed in the rate with which they bound to calnexin after reglucosylation.Figure 5Kinetics of unfolding, reglucosylation, and rebinding to calnexin. tsO45 VSV-infected cells were pulsed for 10 min and chased for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence of BFA as in Fig. 4. The cells were then shifted to 40 °C, samples were removed at the indicated times, and proteins were immunoprecipitated. Anti-VSV immunoprecipitates were incubated overnight with jack bean α-mannosidase or an equal volume of buffer. The positions of G protein and G protein with (Glc1) or without (Glc0) glucose residues are indicated. VSV N protein and soluble G protein are shown for reference. The amount of G protein was measured by densitometry and graphed as a percentage of the maximum amount immunoprecipitated with each antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cellular Location of G Protein and GTTo explore the possibility of separate pools, indirect immunofluorescence was used to determine the intracellular distribution of VSV G protein in cells incubated in the presence of BFA. At 4 h postinfection, BFA was added along with cycloheximide to prevent further protein synthesis. If the cells were then held for 2 h at 30 °C, VSV G protein displayed a faint reticular ER pattern and, in addition, a pattern of bright spots (Fig. 6b). The spots did not appear to stain with anti-calnexin (Fig. 6a). As reported previously for G protein in similarly BFA treated cells (33Scheel J. Pepperkok R. Lowe M. Griffiths G. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), they most likely corresponded to the ER exit sites (34Mellman I. Simons K.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 2Witt H.T. Ber. Bunsen-Ges. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 1923-1942Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cyanobacterial PSI consists of 11 subunits referred to as PsaA to PsaF and PsaI to PsaM. An x-ray structural model of a cyanobacterial PSI complex from the thermophile Synechococcus elongatus has been postulated on the basis of an electron density map calculated at 4-Å resolution (3Krauß N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Despite the comparatively low resolution, it was possible to suggest an assignment of 43 α-helices to the individual subunits of PSI by correlating the information provided by the electron density map with available biochemical and biophysical data. Furthermore, the electron density map allowed the positions of 89 Chl a molecules, constituents of both the core antenna system and electron transfer system, one phylloquinone, and three iron-sulfur clusters to be modeled. The electron transfer reactions of PSI are initiated through excitation of the primary electron donor P700 positioned near the luminal side of the membrane-integral complex. Structurally, P700 consists of a chlorophyll a dimer (eC1/eC1′), whose mutually parallel dihydroporphyrin ring planes are aligned with the membrane normal. Upon excitation, P700* passes an electron to the primary electron acceptor A (probably eC2 or eC2′; see below). Spectroscopically, the first electron acceptor has been identified as A0, in all probability one (though possibly either) of the pair of Chl a monomers denotedeC3 and eC3′ in the structural model of PSI (3Krauß N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This process occurs with a rate constant of about 5·1011 s−1 (5Brettel K. Biophys. Biochim. Acta. 1997; 1318: 322-373Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The charge separation P700⨥A·̄0 is spatially extended across the membrane by electron transfer from the radical A·̄0 to the next electron acceptor spectroscopically referred to as A1; the rate constant is estimated to be 2–5·1010s−1 (for a review, see Ref. 5Brettel K. Biophys. Biochim. Acta. 1997; 1318: 322-373Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). A1 is now generally agreed to be a phylloquinone (6Sétif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2689-2697Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 7Snyder S.W. Rustandi R. Biggins J. Norris J.R. Thurnauer M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9895-9896Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Due to the difficulty of locating the small phylloquinone molecules in low resolution electron density maps and because of the stability of the radical state P700⨥A·̄1, the position and orientation of A1 relative to the PSI holocomplex has recently received increased attention, especially by improved EPR techniques. These have, inter alia, determined the distance between A·̄1 and P700⨥ to be ∼25.4 Å (8Dzuba S.A. Hara H. Kawamori A. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Tsvetkow Y.D. Phys. Chem. Lett. 1997; 264: 238-244Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Zech S.G. Lubitz W. Bittl R. Ber. Bunsen-Ges. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 2041-2044Crossref Google Scholar, 10Bittl R. Zech S.G. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12001-12004Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A relative position for A1 was derived through orientation-dependent pulsed EPR measurements on PSI single crystals (10Bittl R. Zech S.G. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12001-12004Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Geometrically, this position was found to correspond to QK, a single phylloquinone assigned to a well defined pocket in the earlier electron density map (4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The assignment of this position, however, remained internally uncorroborated, since an expected pseudosymmetrically positioned second phylloquinone could not be identified at the time. The three terminal cofactors of the electron transfer system are iron-sulfur centers, FX being closest to P700, followed byF1 and F2 (we retain this nomenclature, for the present, to emphasize the remaining structural ambiguity in their assignment to the known cofactors FA and FB, although see Refs. 11Vassiliev I.R.

In the following, we describe an improved model of the electron transfer system of PSI based on the present electron density map at 4-Å resolution (14Klukas O. Schubert W.-D. Jordan P. Krauß N. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7351-7360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This map reveals the position of the second phylloquinone molecule and allows the spatial positioning of all 11 cofactors of the electron transfer system of PSI. The positions and orientations of individual cofactors are discussed and compared with structural information derived from spectroscopic data. The phases for the electron density map presented here were derived using essentially the same data described previously (4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), although a new native data set with a resolution of 3.5 Å and an additional mercury derivative data set have been included (14Klukas O.

Using the program SHARP (15de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar) instead of the earlier combination VECREF/MLPHARE (16Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar, 17.Otwinowski, Z., Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Isomorphous Replacement and Anomalous Scattering, Wolf, W., Evans, P. R., Leslie, A. G. W., 1991, 80, 86, SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom.Google Scholar) and including a total of five heavy atom derivative data sets, it was possible, by incorporating new minor sites, to derive a significantly improved heavy atom model. The program SOLOMON (16Collaborative Computing Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar) has been employed in the solvent flattening procedure. Due to the low diffraction quality of heavy atom derivative crystals, experimentally obtained phase information is still limited to a resolution of 4 Å. Since no additional phase information at higher resolution could be achieved by phase extension using density modification techniques, the electron density map was calculated at a resolution of 4 Å. It reveals more detailed information on the polypeptide chain folding than previous maps as well as the complete cofactor set of PSI. For the detailed procedure and statistics for the determination of this electron density map, see Ref. 14Klukas O. Schubert W.-D. Jordan P. Krauß N. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7351-7360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar. The previously reported model of the electron transfer system (3Krauß N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) has been used as a basis for the present cofactor model. The Chl a head groups are visible as almost quadratically flat density pockets. The positions and orientations of the Chl a molecules are modeled by 4-fold symmetrical porphyrin moieties, since the present resolution does not permit their asymmetric features to be defined unambiguously. Similarly, the phylloquinone molecules are represented by their naphthalene moieties to interpret the corresponding elongated ellipsoidal electron density. Neither the phylloquinone side chains nor the oxygen atoms have been included in the model. Chl a cofactors of the electron transfer system were placed into the electron density using the program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar), and their positions were optimized using the real space refinement procedure as provided by this program. For Chla molecules center-to-center distances were calculated between the central Mg2+ ions, while for iron-sulfur clusters and phylloquinones the centroid of the cluster and naphthalene model, respectively, have been used. Edge-to-edge distances of cofactors important for the kinetics of electron transfer were determined between the outer atoms of the porphyrin, naphthalene, and iron-sulfur cluster models, respectively. For iron-sulfur clusters, edge-to-edge distances have been determined between the iron and sulfur atoms of the clusters, as modeled. The estimated errors for center-to-center and edge-to-edge distances are on the order of ±1 and ± 2 Å, respectively, the latter reflecting the larger uncertainties in the orientations of the planar cofactors within their molecular planes. In our previous x-ray structural model of PSI (4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), only a tentative positional description of a single phylloquinone was included, assigned to an electron density pocket located between FX and eC3. The lack of a second, pseudosymmetrically positioned phylloquinone, however, prevented an internal corroboration of this identification. The new electron density map now reveals two such electron density structures symmetrically positioned on either side of the pseudo-2-fold rotation axis C2(AB) and located between eC3 and FX. These have been assigned to the phylloquinone electron acceptorsQK and QK′ (Fig. 1). The latter is equivalent to the position QK identified previously (4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Note that following our earlier convention of priming cofactors coordinated by primed α-helices, the position previously denotedQK will be renamed QK′(coordinated by α-helices m′-n′), while the new second phylloquinone will be referred to as QK(coordinated by m-n). QK (QK′) is situated slightly luminally of and close to the N terminus of α-helix n (n′) and immediately adjacent to the loop connecting α-helices m and n (m′ and n′). The corresponding electron density is clearly separated from that of the neighboring α-helices (Fig. 1). Facing away from the loop m-n (m′-n′), each phylloquinone is additionally delimited by the long loop n-o (n′-o′) connecting the C-terminal end of n (n′) to the stromal end of o (o′). In addition to QK and QK′, a significantly more symmetrical arrangement of α-helices and connecting loops on either side of the pseudo-2-fold axis C2(AB) is now apparent in it vicinity as compared with the previously published electron density map. Whereas the earlier model of the α-helix m almost passed through the position now assigned to QK, the stromal end of m now has a comparable inclination relative to the membrane normal as its pseudosymmetric partner m′. The loops m-n (m′-n′) connecting α-helix m (m′) to the “surface” α-helix n (n′) are similar in both shape and length (Fig. 2). The electron densities of both QK and QK′ are elongatedly ellipsoidal (Fig. 1). As a result, the long molecular axis of the naphthoquinone moiety may be identified with some confidence. However, the plane orientation as well as the quinone oxygen atoms remain indeterminate. As a result, the phylloquinone molecules have been modeled by their naphthalene backbones only. These naphthalene models were placed into the electron density optimizing their positions and the orientations of their long molecular axes. The molecular plane of QK was then rotated around the long axis to align the molecular plane with the vector eC1-QK, to account for the observation that the carbonyl O–O-axis is approximately aligned with the vector P700⨥-A·̄1 (19van der Est A. Prisner T. Bittl R. Fromme P. Lubitz W. Möbius K. Stehlik D. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 1437-1443Crossref Google Scholar). Since the electron spin density is primarily located on eithereC1 or eC1′ (20Käß H. Lubitz W. Phys. Lett. 1996; 251: 193-203Google Scholar) (although which one remains to be clarified), the procedure was repeated to align the molecular plane of QK with the vector eC1′-QK. Similarly, two plane orientations were obtained for QK′. The long molecular axes of both QK and QK′ are observed to be inclined by 13 ±5° relative to the membrane plane (equivalent to the crystallographica, b-plane). Projected onto the a, b-plane, the long molecular axis ofQK (QK′) describes an angle of 18° (60°) to the crystallographic a-axis. The axes of QK and QK′ form an angle of 42° with each other. The positions of the iron-sulfur clusters correspond to the highest electron density observed (21Krauß N. Hinrichs W. Witt I. Fromme P. Pritzkow W. Dauter Z. Betzel C. Wilson K.S. Witt H.T. Saenger W. Nature. 1993; 361: 326-331Crossref Scopus (305) Google Scholar). FX was tentatively modeled by fitting a Fe4S4 cluster into the electron density. Contouring the electron density map at 11 S.D. above the mean density reveals a tetrahedrally distorted electron density structure associated with FX (Fig. 3). The most likely explanation is, that this tetrahedron is equivalent to the arrangement of the four iron atoms of the Fe4S4cluster. Modeling a Fe4S4 cluster into this tetrahedral shape results in a good structural match, while the four sulfur atoms lie outside the contour, in agreement with their lower density of electrons. Interestingly, the derived orientation of FX upholds the 2-fold symmetry of C2(AB), a fact that had been assumed on grounds of symmetry yet had remained unsubstantiated. The observation that the gXXprincipal axis of the g tensor of reduced FX is oriented perpendicular to the thylakoid membrane (22Guigliarelli B. Guillaussier J. More C. Sétif P. Bottin H. Bertrand P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 900-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) now favors one of two alternative assignments of g tensor axes to the distorted cubane structure of Fe4S4 clusters. According to EPR studies on Fe4S4 model compounds (23Rius G. Lamotte B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 2464-2469Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Gloux J. Gloux P. Lamotte B. Mouesca J.-M. Rius G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 1953-1961Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), our structural model and the EPR results are in agreement with the assignment, where each of the three principal magnetic axes is normal to one of the mutually orthogonal faces of the distorted Fe4S4 cube (25Kamlowski A. van der Est A. Fromme P. Stehlik D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 185-198Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The orientations of F1 and F2 have been inferred from the 2Fe4S4 ferredoxin structure fromPeptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (26Adman E.T. Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3801-3806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used as a model for PsaC (27.Schubert, W.-D., Klukas, O., Krauß, N., Saenger, W., Fromme, P., Witt, H. T., Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere: Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Photosynthesis, Montpellier, August 20–25, 1995, Mathis, P., II, 1995, 3, 11, Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, The Netherlands.Google Scholar). They are in agreement with those derived independently by EPR experiments on PSI single crystals (28Kamlowski A. van der Est A. Fromme P. Krauß N. Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Stehlik D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ForF1 and F2, such tetragonally shaped density structures as observed in the case of FX are not evident as the electron density “outside” the membrane-integral region is less well defined. The electron transfer system of PSI constitutes the innermost cylindrical core of the larger, membrane-integral photosynthetic reaction center complex. A set of 10 α-helices, five from each of the two central subunits, PsaA and PsaB, tightly encloses the electron transfer system, separating it from the surrounding antenna system (4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The electron transfer system itself consists of two symmetrically arranged cofactor branches (Fig. 2). Now that all cofactors of the electron transfer system have been identified, this pseudosymmetry is seen to encompass the whole of the membrane-integral region, extending from the paireC1/eC1′ near the luminal side toQK/QK′ near the stromal side (Fig. 2). The iron-sulfur cluster FX is located on the pseudo-2-fold axis C2(AB), completing the symmetrical arrangement at the stromal edge of the membrane-integral subunits. Merely the two stromal iron-sulfur clusters F1and F2 (FA and FB), coordinated by the extrinsic subunit PsaC, do not adhere to this 2-fold symmetry. In the direction parallel to the membrane normal, the membrane-integral cofactors divide the membrane into four sections of roughly comparable width, here denoted eC1 - eC2, eC2 - eC3, eC3 - QK, and QK-FX. The height difference for eC1 - eC2, eC2 - eC3, eC3 - QK, and QK-FX amount to 5.9, 8.6, 7.8, and 8.8 Å, respectively, while the total distance eC1-FX is 31.1 Å. This corresponds to fractional distances of 0.19, 0.28, 0.25, and 0.28, respectively (Fig. 4a). Photovoltage measurements on oriented PSI thylakoid membranes estimated values of fractional dielectrically weighted transmembrane distances of 0.62 for P700-A0 (compare with eC1 - eC3, 0.47), 0.16 for A0-A1 (compare with eC3 - QK, 0.25), and 0.22 for A1-FX (compare with QK-FX, 0.28) (29Leibl W. Toupance B. Breton J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10237-10244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 30Hecks B. Wulf K. Breton J. Leibl W. Trissl H.-W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8619-8624Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These relative distances, especially for the pair P700-A0, do not correspond to the x-ray structural model distances eC1-eC3 as well as one might have expected. Because the distances A0-A1( eC3 - QK) and A1-FX( QK-FX) are comparable (29Leibl W. Toupance B. Breton J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10237-10244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), matching our observations, the distance P700-A0( eC1 - eC3) has clearly been overestimated by the photovoltage measurements relative to the other distances. Possibly, the fast rate of charge separation results in a significant error for the distance eC1 - eC3(alternatively, the dielectric constant around P700 may differ substantially from that nearer the middle of the membrane), giving rise to the observed distortion. Comparisons of structural and spectroscopic data have recently been published based on models of PSI derived at 4.5- and 4-Å resolution (4Schubert W.-D. Klukas O. Krauß N. Saenger W. Fromme P. Witt H.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 741-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 5Brettel K. Biophys. Biochim. Acta. 1997; 1318: 322-373Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). These studies, however, included none or, in the latter case, a single phylloquinone position designatedQK (now renamed QK′). Here we will include the latest structural results and compare these to the available spectroscopic data. The Moser-Dutton “ruler” (31Moser C.C. Keske J.M. Warncke K. Farid R.S. Dutton L. Nature. 1992; 355: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar) (an empirical first order relationship between electron transfer rates and shortest edge-to-edge distances of the cofactors involved) provides a simple tool to estimate the “optimal” electron transfer rates from structural data, the optimal electron transfer rate being achieved when the sum of the standard reaction free energy and reorganization energy is essentially zero (32Marcus R.A.

https://openalex.org/W1964370455,"Camptothecin is an antitumor agent that kills cells by converting DNA topoisomerase I into a DNA-damaging poison. Although camptothecin derivatives are now being used to treat tumors in a variety of clinical protocols, the cellular factors that influence sensitivity to the drug are only beginning to be understood. We report here that two genes required for sister chromatid cohesion,TRF4 and MCD1/SCC1, are also required to repair camptothecin-mediated damage to DNA. The hypersensitivity to camptothecin in the trf4 mutant does not result from elevated expression of DNA topoisomerase I. We show that Trf4 is a nuclear protein whose expression is cell cycle-regulated at a post-transcriptional level. Suppression of camptothecin hypersensitivity in the trf4 mutant by gene overexpression resulted in the isolation of three genes: another member of the TRF4 gene family, TRF5, and two genes that may influence higher order chromosome structure, ZDS1 and ZDS2. We have isolated and sequenced two humanTRF4 family members, hTRF4-1 and hTRF4-2. The hTRF4-1gene maps to chromosome 5p15, a region of frequent copy number alteration in several tumor types. The evolutionary conservation ofTRF4 suggests that it may also influence mammalian cell sensitivity to camptothecin. Camptothecin is an antitumor agent that kills cells by converting DNA topoisomerase I into a DNA-damaging poison. Although camptothecin derivatives are now being used to treat tumors in a variety of clinical protocols, the cellular factors that influence sensitivity to the drug are only beginning to be understood. We report here that two genes required for sister chromatid cohesion,TRF4 and MCD1/SCC1, are also required to repair camptothecin-mediated damage to DNA. The hypersensitivity to camptothecin in the trf4 mutant does not result from elevated expression of DNA topoisomerase I. We show that Trf4 is a nuclear protein whose expression is cell cycle-regulated at a post-transcriptional level. Suppression of camptothecin hypersensitivity in the trf4 mutant by gene overexpression resulted in the isolation of three genes: another member of the TRF4 gene family, TRF5, and two genes that may influence higher order chromosome structure, ZDS1 and ZDS2.

The evolutionary conservation ofTRF4 suggests that it may also influence mammalian cell sensitivity to camptothecin. Camptothecin is a plant alkaloid derived from the Chinese treeCamptotheca acuminata which was initially discovered to be active against murine leukemia (1Wall M.E. Wani M.C. Cook C.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 3888-3890Crossref Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). Interest in camptothecin was heightened with the discovery in 1985 that the drug caused DNA damage by specifically targeting DNA topoisomerase I (2Hsiang Y.-H. Hertzberg R. Hecht S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14873-14878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The drug was shown to stabilize a covalent reaction intermediate in which DNA topoisomerase I is linked via a tyrosine residue in the protein to the 3′-phosphoryl end of the broken DNA strand (3Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J. Hecht S.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 4Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The reversible single strand nick that results is thought to lead to cytotoxicity by conversion into an irreversible lethal lesion, probably a double strand break, upon encounter of the damaged DNA with a DNA replication fork (5Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar). If the resulting double strand break is not repaired, cell death results. A rigorous demonstration that DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1) is the sole target of camptothecin came from studies of camptothecin action in yeast. Camptothecin was shown to kill the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae and to poison the action of yeastTOP1 as it does in mammalian cells. Significantly, yeast cells deleted for the TOP1 gene are completely resistant to killing by the drug (6Eng W.K. Faucette L. Johnson R.K. Sternglanz R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 755-760PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of human topoisomerase I in the top1 deletion strain restores sensitivity to killing by camptothecin (6Eng W.K. Faucette L. Johnson R.K. Sternglanz R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 755-760PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Thus, camptothecin kills both mammalian and yeast cells by turning TOP1 into a DNA-damaging agent. Yeast has proven to be an extremely useful system in which to study the parameters affecting camptothecin-mediated cytotoxicity because of the availability of well characterized mutants in DNA repair pathways and facile genetic methods (7Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 8Bjornsti M.A. Knab A.M. Benedetti P. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1994; 34 (suppl.): S1-S5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Nitiss J.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 201-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One important insight was the observation that defects in double strand break repair cause hypersensitivity to killing by camptothecin (6Eng W.K. Faucette L. Johnson R.K. Sternglanz R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 755-760PubMed Google Scholar, 7Nitiss J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that a double strand break generated during DNA replication is a major lethal lesion. Indeed, in yeast cells as in mammalian cells, agents that inhibit DNA synthesis also greatly reduce camptothecin-mediated killing (10Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1095-1102PubMed Google Scholar). The RAD52 epistasis group is required for double strand break repair in S. cerevisiae, and mutations in RAD52 cause marked hypersensitivity to camptothecin. Defects in the DNA damage checkpoint pathways which cause hypersensitivity to camptothecin in mammalian cells also cause inviability in yeast cells expressing atop1 mutation that mimics the effects of camptothecin (11Levin N.A. Bjornsti M.A. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1993; 133: 799-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, sensitivity to camptothecin can be modulated through altered expression of multidrug resistance-related efflux pumps such asSNQ2 (12Reid R.J.D. Kauh E.A. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12091-12099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or through dominant mutations in transcriptional regulators of these pumps (13Kauh E.A. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6299-6303Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast are likely to lead to further insights into the mechanism of repair of this unusual type of DNA damage, provided the important pathways and genes are evolutionarily conserved. We have discovered that TOP1 functions, together with a novel gene called TRF4 (for TopoisomeraseRelated Function), in the process of mitotic chromosome condensation (14Castaño I.B. Brzoska P.M. Sadoff B.U. Chen H.Y. Christman M.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Castaño I.B. Heath-Pagliuso S. Sadoff B.U. Fitzhugh D.J. Christman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2404-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that the Trf4 protein is physically associated with Smc1p and Smc2p (14Castaño I.B. Brzoska P.M. Sadoff B.U. Chen H.Y. Christman M.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), proteins that bind directly to chromosomes and cause condensation (16Hirano T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 357-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Smc protein complex can alter DNA topology (17Kimura K. Hirano T. Cell. 1997; 90: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), which is likely to explain the functional redundancy with TOP1. Recent evidence from our laboratory shows that TRF4 is also required to maintain a different aspect of higher order chromosome structure, sister chromatid cohesion. 1I. B. Castaño and M. F. Christman, unpublished observation. 1I. B. Castaño and M. F. Christman, unpublished observation.Thus, two key aspects of higher order chromosome structure, sister cohesion and mitotic chromosome condensation, are mediated by Trf4p most likely through its association with Smc1p (14Castaño I.B. Brzoska P.M. Sadoff B.U. Chen H.Y. Christman M.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Here we report the surprising observation that the trf4mutant is also profoundly hypersensitive to killing by camptothecin. We also show that mutation of another Smc1p-associated protein required for sister chromatid cohesion, Mcd1p/Scc1p, also results in dramatic camptothecin hypersensitivity. It is of great importance to understand the molecular mechanisms employed to repair DNA damage caused by camptothecin because DNA repair deficiencies are likely to affect sensitivity of cancer cells to camptothecin (18Pommier Y. Gupta M. Valenti M. Nieves-Neira W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 803: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Specific tumors known to be defective in the relevant repair pathway might be significantly more responsive to camptothecin therapy (19Hartwell L.H. Szankasi P. Roberts C.J. Murray A.W. Friend S.H. Science. 1997; 278: 1064-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). A detailed knowledge of the repair mechanisms used in tumors could lead to the identification of novel drug targets. Furthermore, because double strand breaks are known to lead to genomic instability such as gene amplification (20Tlsty T.D. Kastan M.B. Genetic Instability and Tumorigenesis. 221. Springer, Berlin1997: 37-46Google Scholar), a thorough knowledge of the means by which these breaks are repaired is central to understanding tumorigenesis. Our data suggest that higher order chromosome structure may be a critical determinant of camptothecin toxicity. Camptothecin was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a stock concentration of 4 mg/ml. Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), 2The abbreviations used are: MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; SC medium, synthetic complete medium; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydroxyurea, and nocodazole were purchased from Sigma. α-Factor was purchased from Fluka. Yeast strains were routinely grown in YEP or synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking the appropriate supplements with a 2% final concentration of glucose (YPD) or galactose (YP-Gal). The plasmids and yeast strains used in this study are listed in Tables I and II, respectively. All gel purifications were performed using Qiagen columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). All yeast transformations were performed using lithium acetate in the presence of single-stranded DNA (21Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli cells (strain DH5α) were transformed by electroporation (22Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). To construct CB1001, pRS305 was digested with HindIII and PstI, and the linear backbone was gel purified and ligated to a 736-base pairHindIII/PstI fragment containing green fluorescence protein (GFP) excised from plasmidyGFP. Primers containing SalI restriction sites and complementary to the TRF4 gene and a region upstream of the GAL1 promoter on CB636, respectively, were used to generate a Pfu DNA polymerase PCR product containing the GAL1 promoter fused to the TRF4 gene withSalI ends (pGAL-TRF4). This PCR product was purified, digested with SalI, and gel purified. To construct CB1007, CB1001 was digested with SalI, treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and the linear fragment was then gel purified and ligated to SalI-digested pGAL-TRF4PCR product.Table IPlasmids used in this studyPlasmidsDescriptionSourcepRS305LEU2 yeast integrating vectorSikorski and HieteryGFP3GFP mutant 3 HindIII/ PstI fragment in pUC19Dan BurkeCB636pGAL-TRF4 in YEp435Laboratory collectionCB1001GFP mutant 3 HindIII/ PstI fragment in pRS305This studyCB1007pGAL-TRF4-GFP in CB1001This studyCB365URA3.2μ yeast genomic libraryDavid Pellman Open table in a new tab Table IIYeast strains used in this studyYeast strainsDescriptionSourceCY143MATa ade2–1 ura3–1 his3–11, 15 trp1–1 leu2–3, 112 rDNA∷URA3Laboratory collectionCY154MATa top1–7∷LEU2 in CY143Laboratory collectionCY184MAT α ade2–1 ura3–1 his3–11, 15 trp1–1 leu2–3, 112 can1–100 rDNA∷ADE2(28Sadoff B.U.

The genomic structure of the resulting integrant was confirmed by PCR. Transformants were screened by fluorescence microscopy to detect a galactose-dependent GFP signal and tested for complementation of cold sensitivity of CY855. CY1114 was constructed as described above by transformation of CY890 with linear CB1007. Control strains were constructed by transformation of CY855 and CY890 with linear, BstEII-digested pRS305 and selection on SC plates lacking leucine (SC-leu). To construct CY1115, CB1007 was digested with PmlI (which cuts once in the TRF4 gene) and the linear fragment gel purified and used to transform CY143. Transformants were selected on SC-leu and screened for expression of TRF4-GFP by fluorescence microscopy. Equal numbers of cells of wild-type (CY184 and VG-906–1A), trf4::HIS3 (CY1000), and mcd1-1 (CY1229) strains were serially diluted 10-fold, and 5-μl aliquots were spotted on YPD plates containing 10 μg/ml camptothecin and buffered with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Control plates contained final concentrations of 0.25% dimethyl sulfoxide and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Sensitivity to MMS was assayed as described above for wild-type (CY184) and trf4::HIS3 (CY855) strains. Cells were spotted on YPD plates containing 0.025% MMS. Equal numbers of cells of wild-type (CY184), trf4::HIS3 (CY1000), and rad3(CY674) strains were plated on YPD plates and exposed to increasing doses of UV irradiation using a Stratagene UV Stratalinker. Plates were immediately wrapped in aluminum foil and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Colonies were counted, and percent viability was calculated based on the number of colonies arising without exposure to UV irradiation. To prepare crude protein extracts, a single colony from wild-type (CY184),trf4::HIS3 (CY855), and top1::LEU2 (CY154) was resuspended in 30 μl of SED (1 m sorbitol, 25 mm EDTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol), and spheroplasts were prepared by the addition of 4 μl of zymolase (5 mg/ml in 1 m sorbitol). The spheroplasts were pelleted, lysed by the addition of 12 μl of yeast lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5m KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatant containing the crude protein extract was collected. The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad assay. The extracts were diluted in buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. DNA topoisomerase assays were performed using a standard relaxation assay (TopoGEN, Columbus, OH) using 1 μl of diluted crude protein extracts. Reactions were terminated at timed intervals by the addition of stop buffer (TopoGEN) and analyzed by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels and ethidium bromide staining. To assess whether the TRF4-GFP fusion was functional, we tested complementation of the cold-sensitive phenotype of a trf4::HIS3strain by integration of the pGAL-TRF4-GFP construct. Strains CY1112, CY1114, and control strains containing pRS305 integrated at the LEU2 locus were streaked on plates containing glucose and plates containing galactose. Duplicate plates were incubated at 17 °C for 6 days and 30 °C for 2 days. Functional pGAL-TRF4-GFP candidates were identified on the basis of galactose-dependent growth at 17 °C. To prepare cells for fluorescence microscopy, cells were grown overnight in YPD or YP-Gal. Aliquots of cells were removed, treated with α-factor (25 μg/ml final concentration), hydroxyurea (100 mm final concentration), or nocodazole (15 μg/ml final concentration), and incubated for 3 h at 30 °C in the presence of drug. Arrested cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and treated with 0.2 μg/ml DAPI in 0.85% saline for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were diluted in mounting solution (0.1% r-phenylenediamine, 1 × phosphate-buffered saline in 90% glycerol) and placed on glass slides. Cells were examined using a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope with differential interference contrast optics and DAPI and fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. Images were captured digitally using a Princeton Instruments CCD camera with IP Lab spectrum software and colorized using Adobe Photoshop. Relative fluorescence intensities were determined using a Chroma GFP filter and IP Lab spectrum software. A yeast genomic library containingSau3A inserts in vector pSEY18 (URA3.2μ) was used to isolate suppressors. Library DNA was isolated from E. coliby Wizard Midicolumn (Promega) and used to transformtrf4::HIS3 (CY1000). Transformants were selected on SC-ura. After 3 days of incubation at 30 °C, approximately 270,000 total transformants were pooled, concentrated in 15% glycerol, and stored at −70 °C. Aliquots of transformants were periodically thawed, and the cells were diluted and plated on camptothecin plates. To prepare camptothecin plates, 375 μl of a camptothecin stock solution at 4 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide was spread on YPD plates buffered with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and allowed to dry. 460,000 library transformants were screened in this way. Camptothecin-resistant colonies were identified after 2 and 3 days of incubation at 30 °C. A 5-fluoro-orotic acid counterselection (23Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar) was used to isolate rare segregants that had spontaneously lost the URA3-marked library plasmid, and the cells with no plasmid were then retested for camptothecin resistance. 133 of the 166 candidate suppressors were plasmid-dependent for the camptothecin-resistant phenotype. Library plasmids were rescued from yeast cells by “smash-n-grab” (24Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar) and isolated from E. coli using Qiagen columns. Candidate clones were analyzed by PCR using primers to TRF4, and those clones found to contain the TRF4 gene were not analyzed further. Restriction digests of the remaining plasmids revealed the presence of three different library clones that were then sequenced using primers CP206 and CP207, complementary to the multicloning sequence of pSEY18. The primer sequences are: CP206, 5′-CGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCG-3′; CP207, 5′-TGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTC-3′. An otherwise isogenic set oftrf4::HIS3and TRF4+ yeast strains was constructed by single step gene replacement (25Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar) and then tested for sensitivity to the antitumor agent camptothecin. Killing by camptothecin was monitored on Petri plates with or without 10 μg/ml camptothecin incorporated into the agar (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1, the trf4::HIS3 mutant cells are roughly 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive to killing by camptothecin compared with the otherwise isogenic wild-type parent strain. In the absence of camptothecin the wild-type and trf4::HIS3 mutant cells grow equally well. A similar test was performed on congenicmcd1-1 and MCD1+ yeast strains. The MCD1/SCC1 gene product, like TRF4, is physically associated with SMC1 and required for sister chromatid cohesion (26Guacci V. Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Cell. 1997; 91: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 27Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Because MCD1/SCC1 is an essential gene, the test was performed at the semipermissive temperature of 30 °C. The mcd1-1 mutant was observed to be about 4 orders of magnitude more sensitive to camptothecin than the congenic parent strain (Fig. 1). The parent wild-type strains show slightly different camptothecin sensitivities because of their being derived from different strain backgrounds. It is known that overexpression of DNA topoisomerase I in yeast results in increased sensitivity to camptothecin-mediated killing because of the presence of higher concentrations of topoisomerase I enzyme (8Bjornsti M.A. Knab A.M. Benedetti P. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1994; 34 (suppl.): S1-S5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Nitiss J.L. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 201-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because TOP1 and TRF4 provide overlapping functions in yeast (14Castaño I.B. Brzoska P.M. Sadoff B.U. Chen H.Y. Christman M.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Sadoff B.U. Heath-Pagliuso S. Castaño I.B. Yingfang Z. Kieff F.S. Christman M.F. Genetics. 1995; 141: 465-479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that deletion ofTRF4 might result in a compensatory elevation inTOP1 expression and thereby sensitize the trf4mutant cells to camptothecin. We tested this possibility directly by quantitatively measuring DNA topoisomerase I activity in crude extracts from isogenictrf4::HIS3 and TRF4+ cells. Topoisomerase I activity was measured by the ability to relax a negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA substrate in the absence of ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under these conditions neither topoisomerase II nor topoisomerase III activity is detected. Protein extracts were prepared from single yeast colonies. Approximately 5 μg of protein from each extract was added to a 20-μl reaction volume containing 1 μg of negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA. The negatively supercoiled substrate migrates faster than the relaxed reaction product on a 0.8% agarose gel. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C, and reaction progress was monitored by withdrawal of aliquots, addition of stop buffer containing EDTA, and electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels to separate negatively supercoiled substrate from the fully relaxed reaction product. Fig. 2 shows that the relaxation reactions proceed with equivalent kinetics in the trf4::HIS3 and TRF4+ extracts over a 40-min period. Both reactions are nearly complete after 40 min, although some incompletely relaxed topoisomers can be observed in both extracts. Control extracts from a strain containing a top1deletion or mock reactions containing no added cell extract (Fig. 2) show no ability to relax the supercoiled substrate DNA. Therefore, the hypersensitivity to killing by camptothecin in the trf4mutant is not caused by overexpression of DNA topoisomerase I. We also tested for sensitivity to other DNA-damaging agents: MMS, which is an alkylating agent that induces a wide range of DNA lesions, and UV irradiation, which creates intrastrand pyrimidine dimers, a type of DNA damage fundamentally different from those induced by camptothecin and MMS. As shown in Fig. 3A, the trf4 mutant is 2–3 orders of magnitude more sensitive to MMS than the isogenic wild-type strain. But, as seen in Fig. 3B, the trf4 mutant is not more sensitive to UV irradiation than the wild-type strain, whereas a control rad3 mutant is profoundly hypersensitive. We conclude that the trf4 mutant is defective in the repair of a some types of DNA damage which are induced by both camptothecin and MMS. Another explanation for the hypersensitivity of the trf4 mutant to camptothecin is that the TRF4 gene product might be required to repair camptothecin-mediated DNA damage. Because camptothecin killing is largely an S phase event (5Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1095-1102PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether the Trf4 protein is present in the nucleus during S phase. To do this we generated an in-frame gene fusion of GFP to the COOH terminus of TRF4. Complementation experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”) demonstrated that the fusion protein is functional (data not shown). A strain containing an integrated TRF4-GFP fusion expressed from the native TRF4 promoter (CY1115) was examined by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, TRF4-GFP clearly localizes to the nucleus in cells arrested at G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. The DAPI signal indicates the position of the nucleus which is perfectly coincident with the GFP signal in all cells examined. Examination of cells under differential interference contrast confirms the expected morphology for each cell cycle stage: unbudded in G1, small budded in S, and large budded in G2/M. The GFP signal was always observed to be significantly lower in G1 cells relative to S or G2/M, indicating that the abundance of Trf4p is cell cycle regulated. To determine whether the cell cycle regulation of TRF4-GFPis a post-transcriptional event we examined localization of the fusion protein expressed constitutively at high levels from the GAL1 promoter (CY1112) and reexamined the cell cycle-regulated abundance by quantitative fluorescence microscopy. The results are summarized in Table III.Table IIIQuantitation of TRF4-GFP signal under galactose inductionRelative GFP intensityNo. of Cells examinedG11336S10040G2/M5656Cells containing pGAL-TRF4-GFP integrated at the LEU2 locus (CY1112) were grown overnight in YP-galactose, arrested in G1, S or G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and examined for GFP signal by fluorescence microscopy. RelativeGFP intensity was quantitated using IP laboratory spectrum software. The fluorescence intensity of equal areas of both nucleus and cytoplasmic background was measured, and the relative GFPintensity was determined by subtracting the cytoplasmic background from the nuclear signal for each cell examined. The values have been normalized to the S phase intensity, which was arbitrarily set at 100.

The values have been normalized to the S phase intensity, which was arbitrarily set at 100. Even when TRF4-GFP transcription is constitutively expressed at high levels, cells in G1 showed an intensity only 13% of that observed during S phase. Cells in the G2/M phase showed a signal that was 56% as strong as in S phase. Thus, a post-transcriptional event is likely to mediate the cell cycle regulation of Trf4p. TRF4 contains two potential anaphase-promoting complex “destruction box” motifs (29Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W.

Activity of the inositol phosphatase SHIP is required for this negative signal. In vitro, SHIP catalyzes the conversion of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) product phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) into phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. Recent data demonstrate that coligation of FcγRIIb1 with BCR inhibits PIP3-dependent Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) activation and the Btk-dependent generation of inositol trisphosphate that regulates sustained calcium influx. In this study, we provide evidence that coligation of FcγRIIb1 with BCR induces binding of PI3K to SHIP. This interaction is mediated by the binding of the SH2 domains of the p85 subunit of PI3K to a tyrosine-based motif in the C-terminal region of SHIP. Furthermore, the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate was only partially reduced during coligation of BCR with FcγRIIb1 despite a drastic reduction in PIP3. In contrast to the complete inhibition of Tec kinase-dependent calcium signaling, activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt was partially preserved during BCR and FcγRIIb1 coligation. The association of PI3K with SHIP may serve to activate PI3K and to regulate downstream events such as B cell activation-induced apoptosis.

A distinct effect of BCR/FcγRIIb1 coligation is the loss of sustained calcium influx and a selective reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins (3Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G. J.

Cocross-linking of BCR with FcγRIIb1 results in recruitment of SHIP (SH2 domain-containing inositol-polyphosphate 5′-phosphatase) to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif present in the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIb1 (8Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Two approaches provided evidence for a functional requirement for SHIP during FcγRIIb1-mediated inhibitory signaling. Ectopic expression of a chimeric KIR/FcγRIIb1 protein, containing the extracellular and transmembrane regions of KIR and the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIb1, in natural killer cells inhibited the lysis of target cells bearing the HLA class I ligand for the extracellular KIR portion of the chimeric receptor (9Gupta N. Scharenberg A.M. Burshtyn D.N. Wagtmann N. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Kinet J.-P. Long E.O. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Coexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of SHIP, but not the tyrosine phosphatase Shp-1, reverted the inhibitory signal delivered by FcγRIIb1 in natural killer cells. Conversely, dominant-negative Shp-1, but not SHIP, reverted the negative signal mediated by KIR (9Gupta N. Scharenberg A.M. Burshtyn D.N. Wagtmann N. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Kinet J.-P. Long E.O. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The second approach made use of chicken DT40 B cells in which the SHIP or Shp-1 genes had been deleted by targeted homologous recombination (10Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). FcγRIIb1dependent inhibition was lost in the absence of SHIP, but remained intact in cells lacking Shp-1 (10Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). SHIP is a 145-kDa cytosolic protein that contains a single SH2 domain, a catalytic region that bears significant homology to inositol 5′-phosphatases, and several binding sites for other signaling proteins in its C-terminal region (11Lioubin M.N.

SHIP interacts with Shc (14Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar), which couples proximal signaling to the Grb2/Sos/Ras activation pathway. SHIP tyrosine phosphorylation and association with Shc increases upon BCR/FcγRIIb1 coligation (14Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar). It was proposed that SHIP inhibits the BCR activation signal by competing with Grb2 for binding to Shc, thereby breaking the Ras signaling pathway (15Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Cooney D. Pradhan M. Coggeshall K.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 424-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). BCR ligation leads to phosphorylation of the tyrosines at positions 484 and 515 in CD19, which then recruit and activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (16Tuveson D.A. Carter R.H. Soltoff S.P.

Coligation of BCR with FcγRIIb1 leads to initial phosphorylation of CD19, followed by its rapid dephosphorylation (6Kiener P.A. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Ledbetter J.A. Nadler S.G. Diegel M.L.

Immunity. 1997; 7: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). One model proposes that a tyrosine phosphatase, such as Shp-1, dephosphorylates CD19, thereby blocking BCR-mediated activation by preventing PI3K activation (7Hippen K.L. Buhl A.M. D'Ambrosio D. Nakamura K. Persin C. Cambier J.C. Immunity. 1997; 7: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, CD19 dephosphorylation cannot always account for FcγRIIb1-mediated negative signaling because such signaling operates in mast cells and natural killer cells that do not express CD19 (8Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 9Gupta N. Scharenberg A.M. Burshtyn D.N. Wagtmann N. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Kinet J.-P. Long E.O. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dephosphorylation by Shp-1 is not required for FcγRIIb1-mediated inhibition (8Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 9Gupta N. Scharenberg A.M. Burshtyn D.N. Wagtmann N. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20038-20043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In vitro, SHIP cleaves the 5′-phosphate from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate to give rise to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2) and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, respectively (12Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Unlike other 5′-phosphatases, SHIP preferentially utilizes substrates that are phosphorylated on the D3 position of the inositol ring, thereby linking its activity to the PI3K pathway. Coengagement of FcγRIIb1 with BCR leads to a drastic reduction of cellular PIP3 at any time point of cross-linking as detected by thin-layer chromatography (19Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z.M. Lin S.Q. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). PIP3 may either not be produced because of inactivation of PI3K, as proposed in the CD19 dephosphorylation model, or be rapidly turned over. Recruitment of SHIP by FcγRIIb1 may serve to achieve a rapid conversion of PIP3 to PIP2. Therefore, the possibility of a physical association between SHIP and PI3K was investigated. Coengagement of BCR with FcγRIIb1 resulted in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3K to SHIP. This interaction is mediated by direct binding of the SH2 domain of PI3K to a signature motif in the C-terminal region of SHIP. In addition, production of PIP2 and activation of Akt (also called protein kinase B) were observed during BCR/FcγRIIb1 coengagement. The B cell line A20 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. F(ab′)2, intact rabbit anti-mouse IgG, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Anti-PI3K p85 and p110 subunit antibodies, unconjugated and biotin-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibodies, and a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of the PI3K p85 C-terminal SH2 domain were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Recombinant GST protein and wortmannin were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies against Akt and phospho-Akt (specific for phosphoserine 473) were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA), and anti-Flag antibody (M2) was from Eastman Kodak Co. A rabbit antiserum against the peptide sequence VPACGVSSLNEMINP in the C-terminal region of SHIP was generated (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Peroxidase conjugates of streptavidin and sheep anti-mouse IgG were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Different deletion mutants of SHIP were obtained from M. Lioubin and L. Rohrschneider (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). The N-terminal SH2 domain is designated as n, the catalytic domain as cat, and the C-terminal region following the catalytic domain as c. Thus, the truncated mutants contain different combinations of n, cat, and c regions, i.e. ncat, nc, and catc. SHIPncat has amino acids 5–866; SHIPnc has a deletion in the catalytic domain corresponding to amino acids 500–809 and a replacement with amino acids EF arising from an EcoRI site located at the site of deletion; and SHIPcatc contains amino acids 174–1190. All constructs have a Flag tag followed by a NotI site at the amino terminus, which adds amino acids MGDYKDDDDKRPH onto the amino terminus of each. The cDNAs were cloned into plasmid pSCF4, a modified pSC65 plasmid (a gift of B. Moss), which contains a Kozak sequence and a Flag sequence followed by a multiple cloning site. Recombinant vaccinia viruses were generated and amplified as described (20Earl P.L. Moss B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988: 16.17.1-16.17.16Google Scholar). A20 cells (2 × 107) were washed twice with serum-free Iscove's medium, resuspended, and incubated with F(ab′)2fragment or intact rabbit anti-mouse IgG for the indicated times at 37 °C. Stimulation was stopped by addition of cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and by rapid centrifugation of the cells in a Picofuge (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cells were lysed in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.0, containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm iodoacetamide, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium metavanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies and protein G-agarose beads. Recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding SHIPncat, SHIPnc, or SHIPcatc were used to infect NIH 3T3 cells as described (21Scharenberg A.M. Lin S. Cuenod B. Yamamura H. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3385-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells (5 × 106) were infected in suspension at 5 plaque-forming units/cell with the indicated recombinant viruses in 2 ml of infection medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2 mm glutamine, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 3.5 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed once with DPBS and incubated in 1 ml of DPBS or pervanadate solution (10 mmH2O2 + 0.1 mm sodium metavanadate in DPBS) for 15 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed with cold DPBS and lysed, and the lysates were used for immunoprecipitation as described above. Synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid sequences in the C-terminal region of SHIP and in the PI3K-binding motif in CD19 (SLGSQS(pY)EDMRG) were purchased from Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). The SHIP peptides used were EMINPNYIGMGP, EMINPN(pY)IGMGP, and EMINPN(pY)IGRGP. All peptides were synthesized with an N-terminal biotin tag for coupling with streptavidin-agarose beads. The peptides were dissolved at 0.1 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated with streptavidin-agarose beads (1-ml packed volume) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with PBS, pH 7.4, and suspended in 1 ml of PBS. Lysates of unstimulated A20 cells were prepared as described above and incubated with 100 μl of the above peptide-streptavidin-agarose conjugate overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed and boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the bound material was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to silver staining or immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon P membranes. The blots were probed with the indicated antibodies and developed using the ECL detection reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. In the far Western blotting procedure, membranes were overlaid with 4 μg/ml recombinant GST protein or GST fused to the C-terminal SH2 domain of PI3K p85 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The membranes were washed with buffer without dithiothreitol, reblocked, and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibodies. After washing, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and developed with ECL reagents. A20 cells were labeled with32P and stimulated as described above. This was followed by extraction and deacylation of lipids and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the glycerophosphoinositol head groups (22Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 23Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A20 cells were stimulated with F(ab′)2 or intact anti-IgG antibodies, and immunoprecipitates of PI3K were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed for associated phosphotyrosine-containing proteins by Western blotting. A distinct phosphoprotein band migrating at ∼145 kDa coimmunoprecipitated with PI3K as early as 5 s after stimulation with intact antibody, but not with the F(ab′)2 antibody (Fig. 1A). Probing with anti-SHIP antiserum revealed the presence of SHIP at that position (Fig. 1B). To test whether SHIP was directly associated with PI3K or whether it was immunoprecipitated as part of the receptor complex by the stimulating intact anti-Ig antibody, the lysates were incubated with protein G-agarose beads alone prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-SHIP antibodies. Under those conditions, no 145-kDa band was seen in the protein G precipitates (data not shown). Cocross-linking of BCR with FcγRIIb1 through an intact IgG also enhanced the level of p85 in immunoprecipitates of SHIP (data not shown). Thus, coligation of BCR with FcγRIIb1 leads to the recruitment of PI3K to SHIP. Tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP upon BCR/FcγRIIb1 coligation exceeds that obtained by cross-linking BCR alone (8Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 14Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, PI3K association with SHIP observed during coligation could be mediated by the binding of PI3K SH2 domains to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in SHIP. The p85 subunit of PI3K has two SH2 domains, one each at the N and C termini. The phosphotyrosine-containing motif recognized by these two domains includes a pYXXM sequence for the C-terminal SH2 domain and a more stringent pY(I/V/L)XM sequence for the N-terminal SH2 domain (24Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar). A GST fusion protein of the C-terminal SH2 domain was used to test for direct binding to SHIP. A20 cells were stimulated with F(ab′)2 or intact antibodies, and either SHIP or phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysates. In both cases, the GST-p85 SH2 fusion protein bound in a far Western blot to a protein of 145 kDa present in lysates of A20 cells stimulated with intact antibody (Fig. 2A, Expts. 1 and 2). Thus, p85 can bind directly to SHIP and to a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that comigrated with SHIP on SDS-PAGE. GST alone did not bind SHIP under the same conditions (Fig. 2B), but it reacted with two nonspecific bands migrating at ∼135 and 140 kDa in anti-SHIP immunoprecipitates of both unstimulated and F(ab′)2- and intact anti-Ig-stimulated cell lysates. The presence of SHIP in the anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-SHIP immunoprecipitates is shown in Fig. 2C. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP under conditions of BCR and FcγRIIb1 coligation is evident. Direct binding of the PI3K SH2 domain to SHIP by far Western blotting was also greater after receptor coligation than after cross-linking BCR alone. The SHIP cDNA was broadly divided into three regions encoding the SH2 domain designated as n, the central catalytic region containing the sequences conserved in several 5′-phosphatases designated as cat, and the C-terminal region designated as c (which contains sites for interaction with the PTB domains of Shc (12Damen J.E.

Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold R. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar)). Deletion mutants containing different combinations of these three domains (Fig. 3), namely ncat (∼105 kDa), nc (∼110 kDa), and catc (∼120 kDa), were inserted into recombinant vaccinia viruses and tested for their ability to bind PI3K. The deletion mutants were expressed in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, immunoprecipitated following a stimulation with pervanadate, and subjected to far Western blotting with the GST-p85 SH2 fusion protein. All three mutants were tyrosine-phosphorylated upon pervanadate treatment (Fig. 4A), but only the nc and catc mutants bound the SH2 domain of PI3K (Fig. 4B). As these two molecules share only the C-terminal sequence of SHIP, the binding site must be in that region. The level of expression of all three deletion mutants was comparable (Fig. 4C). The deletion mutants ncat and nc also coimmunoprecipitated a protein at 52 kDa upon pervanadate stimulation (Fig. 4A), which could be the Shc adaptor protein associated with the N-terminal SH2 domain of SHIP. Amino acids 917–920 (YIGM) in the C-terminal region of SHIP correspond to a perfect motif for binding the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of PI3K (24Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar). The tyrosine at position 917 is phosphorylated upon BCR/FcγRIIb1 coligation (25Liu L. Damen J.E. Hughes M.R. Babic I. Jirik F.R. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8983-8988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Twelve-amino acid-long peptides containing SHIP sequence 917–920 were synthesized with either unphosphorylated (YIGM) or phosphorylated (pYIGM) Tyr-917. Another phosphorylated peptide carrying the substitution M920R (pYIGR) and a phosphopeptide corresponding in sequence to the C-terminal PI3K-binding motif in CD19 (SLGSQSYEDMRG) were also synthesized for negative and positive controls, respectively. All biotinylated peptides were coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads and used to pull down proteins in A20 lysates. Two proteins of ∼85 and 110 kDa bound only to the CD19 peptide and the pYIGM peptide and not to the streptavidin-agarose beads alone or to pYIGR and unphosphorylated YIGM peptides (Fig. 5A). Immunoblotting with anti-PI3K antibodies revealed that these proteins comigrated with the p85 (Fig. 5B) and p110 (Fig. 5C) subunits of PI3K, respectively. Thus, the in vitro data shown in Figs. 4 and 5 suggest a possible mechanism by which SHIP binds PI3K upon B cell stimulation with intact anti-Ig antibodies or immune complexes. A potential outcome of the association of SHIP with PI3K in A20 cells stimulated with intact anti-Ig is the efficient production of PIP2, provided that SHIP and PI3K retain their catalytic activities. To test this possibility, A20 cells were stimulated with F(ab′)2 or intact antibodies for different times, and the total cellular levels of PIP2 and PIP3 were determined using a sensitive HPLC assay. Production of PIP2 upon FcγRIIb1 coligation was approximately two-thirds of that upon BCR stimulation alone (Fig. 6, upper panel). In contrast, there was a marked inhibition of the PI3K product PIP3 at early time points and complete loss at sustained time points (Fig. 6,lower panel). Activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt requires binding of its pleckstrin homology domain to membrane-bound phosphatidylinositides (26Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 27Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). In particular, binding to PIP2 results in activation of Akt in vitro (28Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 29Klippel A. Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Full Akt activation requires sequential phosphorylation by two kinases, the second of which phosphorylates serine 473 in Akt after binding to PIP3(30Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We used phosphorylation of serine 473 as an indicator of Akt activation after signaling via BCR. A20 cells were stimulated with F(ab′)2 or intact antibodies for 2, 5, or 10 min, and active Akt was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted using antibodies specific for phosphoserine 473. Fig. 7A reveals a large increase in the activity of Akt, which was clearly diminished during coligation of BCR with FcγRIIb1. To test whether PI3K activity is required for Akt activation upon B cell stimulation, two inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, were used. At low concentrations, these inhibitors block PI3K activity without affecting phosphoinositide 4-kinases (31Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A20 cells were pretreated with wortmannin (Fig. 7B) or LY294002 (data not shown) and then stimulated with F(ab′)2 or intact antibodies for 2 min. Both BCR- and BCR/FcγRIIb1-induced Akt activities were completely lost upon inhibition of PI3K (Fig. 7B). Thus, PI3K activity persists during BCR/FcγRIIb1 coligation and is required for Akt activation. Coengagement of BCR with FcγRIIb1 results in a diminished transient calcium flux and a loss of sustained calcium flux (3Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G. J. Exp.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The sustained calcium flux in BCR-triggered B cells requires activation of Btk, a member of the Tec kinase family that, in turn, activates phospholipase Cγ (19Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z.M. Lin S.Q. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 32Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Activation of Btk is dependent on the binding of its pleckstrin homology domain to PIP3 (19Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z.M. Lin S.Q. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). A noticeable effect of FcγRIIb1 coligation is a drastic reduction of PIP3, otherwise produced very rapidly upon BCR triggering (19Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z.M. Lin S.Q. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The loss of PIP3 could be due to a reduced PI3K activity and conversion to PIP2 by a non-rate-limiting SHIP, to an increased SHIP activity, or to a complete loss of PI3K activity. However, the production of the SHIP metabolite PIP2 suggests that PI3K remains active during FcγRIIb1-mediated inhibition of the BCR activation signal. In addition, the direct association of PI3K with SHIP, demonstrated here, may serve to enhance the conversion of PIP3 to PIP2. Far Western blotting with the C-terminal SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of PI3K mapped the site of interaction to the C-terminal region of SHIP. Synthetic phosphopeptides that included sequences flanking tyrosine 917 of SHIP bound PI3K in cell lysates. The inducible association of PI3K with tyrosine-phosphorylated SHIP described here is different from the constitutive association of PI3K with an unidentified PIP3 5-phosphatase activity in human platelets (35Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Matzaris M. Brown S. Mitchell C.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4490-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The novel 5-phosphatase reported in that study is distinct from SHIP since its catalytic activity in vitro was limited to the substrate PIP3. Production of PIP2 during BCR/FcγRIIb1 coligation was consistently less than during BCR-mediated activation. This is probably due, in part, to a lower activity of PI3K and hence lower production of the SHIP substrate PIP3. As CD19 is dephosphorylated rapidly after BCR/FcγRIIb1 coligation (6Kiener P.A. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Ledbetter J.A. Nadler S.G. Diegel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3838-3844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Hippen K.L. Buhl A.M. D'Ambrosio D. Nakamura K. Persin C. Cambier J.C. Immunity. 1997; 7: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), a major source of PI3K activation is lost. Recruitment of PI3K by tyrosine-phosphorylated SHIP may serve to compensate for this loss. However, SHIP is not absolutely required for PI3K activation in avian DT40 B cells because a sustained calcium signal was observed after BCR/FcγRIIb1 coengagement in a SHIP-negative DT40 mutant cell (10Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the rapid conversion of PIP3 by SHIP affects PI3K activation directly, or indirectly through a diminished PIP3-dependent activation of Ras (via Sos) (36Chen R.H. Corbalan-Garcia S. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,37Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A.

To clearly address whether the catalytic activity of SHIP and/or PI3K is responsible for the observed pattern of PIP3 and PIP2 production, an inhibitor of SHIP phosphatase activity would be necessary. PIP2 and PIP3 control the activation of Akt by recruiting the pleckstrin homology domains of Akt and of another serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates Akt (26Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 27Stokoe D.

Akt delivers an anti-apoptotic signal by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD, a member of the Bcl-2 protein family (38Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar, 39White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Our data show residual activation of Akt during BCR/FcγRIIb1 coligation as measured by Akt phosphorylation on serine 473. This remaining Akt activation is in contrast to the complete loss of the sustained calcium flux mediated by the PIP3-dependent Tec kinase Btk during BCR/FcγRIIb1 coligation (19Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z.M. Lin S.Q. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.-P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The wortmannin sensitivity of Akt activation strongly suggests that PI3K activity is also retained. Although apoptosis of B cells after BCR/FcγRIIb1 coligation can occur and may even exceed that observed after BCR-mediated activation (40Ashman R.F. Peckham D. Stunz L.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5-11PubMed Google Scholar), the SHIP/PI3K/Akt pathway described here may lead to at least some anti-apoptotic signal. An anti-apoptotic effect of SHIP after BCR/FcγRIIb1 coligation has been suggested by the observation of increased apoptosis of DT40 cells deficient in SHIP and of DT40 cells expressing a mutant FcγRIIb1 that fails to bind SHIP (10Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). A pro-apoptotic mediator that binds to FcγRIIb1 was proposed to explain these observations (10Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the reduced survival of DT40 cells expressing the mutated FcγRIIb1 that fails to recruit SHIP may have been caused by the lack of SHIP-mediated PIP2production and, in turn, by a reduced Akt-mediated survival signal. In conclusion, this study demonstrates an association of the p85 subunit of PI3K with the inositol phosphatase SHIP in response to coligation of BCR with the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb1. PI3K activity and PIP2 production were not abrogated by FcγRIIb1 ligation to BCR. We suggest that the physical association of SHIP and PI3K may provide a novel mode of PI3K activation and an enhanced conversion of PIP3 to PIP2. We thank M. Lioubin and L. Rohrschneider for deletion mutants of SHIP, L. Samelson for helpful suggestions, and M. Weston for technical assistance."

An essential intermediate step in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination is the formation of a thioester complex between E6-AP and ubiquitin in the presence of distinct E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes including human UbcH5, a member of the UBC4/UBC5 subfamily of E2s. Similarly, several hect domain proteins, including Saccharomyces cerevisiaeRSP5, form ubiquitin thioester complexes, indicating that hect domain proteins in general have E3 activity.

Ubiquitin conjugation (ubiquitination) requires the combined action of ubiquitin-activating enzymes E1 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; SCF, SKP1, CDC53, F-box protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s) 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; SCF, SKP1, CDC53, F-box protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide(s) (or UBA), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E2 (or UBC), and, probably in most cases, ubiquitin-protein ligases E3 (or UBR). In the first step, ubiquitin is activated by E1 at the expense of ATP via the formation of a high energy thioester intermediate between E1 and ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is then transferred to one of a number of E2s, preserving the thioester bond. Finally, ubiquitin is covalently linked to a substrate protein either by the E2 alone or in conjunction with an E3. This sequential mode of ubiquitin transfer indicates that E2s and in particular E3s play a major role in substrate recognition. Proteins that have been identified with E3 activity include yeast UBR1 (8Bartel B. Wünning I. Varshavsky A.

Some E3s may function as docking proteins by binding specifically to E2s and substrate proteins, thereby facilitating E2-catalyzed ubiquitination of the substrates. Such E3s appear to be represented by the SCF complexes (14Feldman R.M. Corell C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J.

Other E3s are loaded with ubiquitin by E2s via thioester formation, indicating that these E3s directly catalyze the attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins.

Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 11Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L. Scheffner M. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). They are characterized by a C-terminal region of approximately 350 amino acids in length, which shows significant similarity to the C terminus of E6-AP, and therefore has been termed the hect domain (10Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The hect domain appears to represent the catalytic domain of these otherwise unrelated proteins because the hect domain is necessary and sufficient to form ubiquitin thioester complexes in the presence of its cognate E2s (11Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12148-12154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Similar to E2s, it appears that a cell contains a number of different hect domain proteins. Based on data base searches, the genome of S. cerevisiae encodes five different hect domain proteins (4Smith S.E. Koegl M. Jentsch S. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 437-446PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the human genome codes for at least 20 hect domain proteins (11Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12148-12154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All known E2s are characterized by a conserved core domain of approximately 150 amino acids in size, termed the UBC domain, and can be grouped into four classes based on the presence or absence of additional N-terminal and/or C-terminal sequences (25Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Because UbcH5 belongs to the so-called class I E2 enzymes, which consist of the UBC domain only, we were interested to determine the regions of UbcH5 that specify its ability to interact with members of the hect domain family. Here we report that a region surrounding the catalytic site cysteine residue, as well as a phenylalanine residue at position 62 that is characteristic for members of the UBC4/UBC5 subfamily, are critical for the ability of UbcH5 to interact with E6-AP and RSP5in vitro. This indicates that the structural conformation of the thioester-forming region of E2s determines whether or not a given E2 can functionally interact with hect domain proteins. The pET-3a expression plasmid for UbcH5 has been described previously (21Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for UbcM3 and UbcH1 were constructed by ligating PCR products into pET-3a (UbcH1 and UbcM3) and pGEX-2T (UbcM3). The valine residue at position 129 of UbcM3 (or position 83 with respect to the amino acid sequence of UbcH5; see Fig. 1A), the serine residue at position 83 of the chimeric E2 35 (see Fig. 1B), and the asparagine residue at position 65 of UbcH1 (see Fig. 1A) were altered to serine (3-V83S), valine (35-S83V), and phenylalanine (1-N65F), respectively, by PCR-directed mutagenesis. The respective cDNAs were cloned into pGEX-2T. The cDNAs used as template for UbcM3 (kindly provided by S. Jentsch) and UbcH5 in PCR have been described (21Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2789-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A UbcH1 cDNA was obtained by RNA PCR using cytoplasmic RNA prepared from HeLa cells. Expression plasmids encoding the various chimeric E2s were constructed by ligating PCR products into pET-3a (355, 533, 335, 553) or pGEX-2T (355, 533, 335, 553, 35, 353, 335-V83S, 35-S83V, 155, 155-N65F). The cDNAs encoding the various chimeric E2s consist of the following nucleotides (nt) of the cDNA of the respective E2s (with nt 1 defined as A in the initial ATG): 553, nt 1–320 of UbcH5 fused to nt 459–582 of UbcM3; 533, nt 1–186 of UbcH5 fused to nt 325–582 ofUbcM3; 355, nt 1–324 of UbcM3 fused to nt 187–444 of UbcH5; 35 and 35-S83V, nt 1–369 ofUbcM3 fused to nt 232–444 of UbcH5; 353, nt 1–369 of UbcM3 fused to nt 232–320 of UbcH5fused to nt 459–582 of UbcM3; 335 and 335-V83S, nt 1–458 of UbcM3 fused to nt 321–444 of UbcH5; 155 and 155-N65F, nt 1–195 of UbcH1 fused to nt 187–444 ofUbcH5. All PCR-generated cDNAs were sequenced to rule out the possibility that second site mutations were introduced during PCR amplification. UbcH1, UbcH5, UbcM3, and the chimeric E2s 355, 335, 533, 553 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using the pET expression system as described previously (21Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 22Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For ubiquitination and ubiquitin thioester assays, crude bacterial extracts containing the respective E2s were used. GST fusion proteins (E2s, ubiquitin, and E6-E7) were expressed in E. coli DH5α and affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). UbcM3, UbcM3-V83S, and the various chimeric E2s were cleaved with thrombin (Novagen) while bound to glutathione-Sepharose to yield the respective free E2s. Upon cleavage, the supernatants containing the free E2s were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the dialyzed proteins stored at 4 °C. For generation of radiolabeled E6-E7 or radiolabeled ubiquitin, the respective GST fusion protein was radioactively labeled while bound to glutathione-Sepharose using protein kinase A (Sigma) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (9Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled fusion proteins were then eluted with 10 mm glutathione and used directly in ubiquitination assays (E6-E7) or cleaved with thrombin to yield free ubiquitin. Upon cleavage, thrombin was inactivated by incubation at 75 °C for 15 min, precipitated proteins were spun out by centrifugation, and the ubiquitin-containing supernatant was used in thioester assays. E6-AP, RSP5, RSP5ΔC6, and wheat germ E1 were prepared from Sf9 cells infected with the respective recombinant baculoviruses (RSP5 and wheat germ E1 encoding recombinant baculoviruses were kindly provided by J. M. Huibregtse and W. Krek, respectively). Partial purification of E6-AP, RSP5, and RSP5ΔC6 was performed as described previously (9Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar,10Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4918-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and partial purification of E1 was performed as described for bacterially expressed E1 (9Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). Formation of thioester adducts of the different E2s, E6-AP, RSP5, and RSP5ΔC6 with ubiquitin was determined essentially as described previously (19Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained approximately 20–50 ng of E1, 300 ng of radiolabeled ubiquitin, the respective E2s, and 300 ng of E6-AP or 100–300 ng of RSP5 as indicated. With respect to their enzymatic activity, similar amounts of the different E2s were used as assessed by their ability to form thioester complexes with ubiquitin in the presence of E1. Ubiquitination assays using bacterially expressed GST-E6-E7 as a substrate were performed as described (9Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). Similar to UbcH5, murine UbcM3 and its putative human homolog UbcH6 are members of the UBC4/UBC5 subfamily of E2s (22Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26Matuschewski K. Hauser H.-P. Treier M. Jentsch S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2789-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Unlike UbcH5, however, UbcM3 and UbcH6 contain an N-terminal extension of 46 amino acids in addition to the UBC domain (Fig. 1A). Despite its similarity to UbcH5 at the amino acid sequence level, it was shown that UbcH6 is only weakly active in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination (22Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this difference between UbcH5 and UbcH6 was not due to the N-terminal extension of UbcH6 because a respective deletion mutant of UbcH6 was as inefficient in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination as full-length UbcH6. UbcH6 and UbcM3 are identical at the amino acid sequence level, except for two amino acid exchanges in the N-terminal extension (22Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 26Matuschewski K. Hauser H.-P. Treier M. Jentsch S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2789-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and thus can be considered functionally equivalent. For cloning reasons, a cDNA encoding UbcM3 was used for the following rather than a cDNA encoding UbcH6. To determine the region(s) of UbcH5 that is responsible for the observed difference to UbcM3, initially two cDNAs encoding two different chimeric E2s between UbcH5 and UbcM3 were generated and cloned into the bacterial pET expression vector system. The respective E2s were termed 533 and 355 (the nomenclature reflects the relative contribution of the UBC domain of UbcH5 and UbcM3 to the UBC domain of the respective chimeric E2; Fig. 1B) and consist of the N-terminal 62 amino acids of UbcH5 fused to the C-terminal 85 amino acids of UbcM3 and of the N-terminal 108 amino acids of UbcM3 fused to the C-terminal 85 amino acids of UbcH5, respectively. The chimeric E2s were expressed in bacteria and tested for their ability to interact with E6-AP. An essential intermediate step in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination is the formation of a thioester complex between E6-AP and ubiquitin in the presence of E1 and UbcH5 or UbcH7 (19Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 22Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, 355 was able to transfer ubiquitin to E6-AP with an efficiency similar to UbcH5, whereas 533 was almost inactive under the conditions used. It should be noted that similar amounts of active E2s were used as determined by their ability to form thioester complexes with ubiquitin in the presence of E1 (data not shown). Taken together, this clearly shows that the difference between UbcM3 and UbcH5 with respect to their ability to interact with E6-AP maps to the C-terminal 85 amino acids of UbcH5. To further delineate the region of UbcH5 that is critical for functional interaction with E6-AP, additional chimeric E2s were constructed (Fig. 1B). Because some of the chimeric E2s were expressed at rather low levels, if at all, in the pET expression system (not shown), making it difficult to assess the amount of active E2, the E2s were expressed as GST fusion proteins. The fusion proteins were concentrated by affinity chromatography and then the GST part was removed by thrombin cleavage to ensure that the ability of the respective E2s to interact with E6-AP was not influenced by their fusion to GST. This showed that a chimeric E2 (termed “35”; Fig. 3A) containing the C-terminal 70 amino acids of UbcH5 was as active as 355 in E6-AP/ubiquitin thioester assays, whereas a chimeric E2 containing the C-terminal 40 amino acids of UbcH5 (335) was significantly less active. This indicates that a region of UbcH5 comprising amino acids 78–107 is critical for interaction with E6-AP. Indeed, the chimeric E2 353 in which the corresponding region of UbcM3 was replaced by amino acids 78–107 of UbcH5 was nearly as active as 355 in transferring ubiquitin to E6-AP. Amino acid sequence comparison of UbcH5 with UbcM3 (Fig. 1A) reveals that amino acid region 78–107 of UbcH5 contains six amino acid exchanges to the corresponding region of UbcM3. The most significant difference would appear to be the presence of a serine residue at position 83 of UbcH5, whereas UbcM3 contains a valine residue at the corresponding position. Therefore, point mutants of 35, 335, and UbcM3 were generated by substituting the corresponding amino acid with either valine (35-S83V) or serine (335-V83S or 3-V83S). Indeed, 35-S83V was unable to load E6-AP with ubiquitin (Fig. 3A). In contrast, thioester complex formation of E6-AP with ubiquitin was observed in the presence of 335-V83S and 3-V83S, although with a reduced efficiency compared with 355 (Fig. 3A) or UbcH5 (not shown). This indicates that the serine residue at position 83 of UbcH5 is necessary but not sufficient for an efficient interaction of UbcH5 with E6-AP. Taken together, the data presented above indicate that the structural conformation of the region surrounding the catalytic site cysteine residue is important for UbcH5 to functionally interact with E6-AP. Furthermore, the amino acid sequence differences in this region are mainly responsible for the observed difference between UbcH5 and UbcM3 with respect to their ability to interact with E6-AP. This notion is further supported by the finding that only those chimeric E2s that were able to load E6-AP with ubiquitin were able to support E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination of an artificial substrate protein (see Fig. 5 and Fig. 1B). The yeast hect domain protein RSP5, which except for the hect domain is not related to E6-AP at the amino acid sequence level, was previously shown to form thioester complexes with ubiquitin in the presence of both UbcH5 and UbcM3 but with significantly less efficiency in the presence of UbcM3 (16Lisztwan J. Marti A. Sutterlüty H. Gstaiger M. Wirbelauer C. Krek W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 368-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, ubiquitin thioester assays with RSP5 were performed using the various chimeric E2s. As shown in Fig. 3B, the same chimeric E2s that could interact with E6-AP were able to load RSP5 with ubiquitin, whereas those that did not interact with E6-AP also did not interact with RSP5. This indicates that similar amino acid sequences or structures of UbcH5 are required for its interaction with both E6-AP and RSP5. Replacement of the N-terminal 62 amino acids of UbcH5 with the corresponding region from UbcM3 resulted in a chimeric E2 that was capable of transferring ubiquitin to both E6-AP and RSP5 (355; Figs. 2and 3). This shows that this region is not responsible for the observed difference between UbcH5 and UbcM3. Because UbcH5 and UbcM3 belong to the same subfamily of E2s, however, the possibility that the N-terminal 62 amino acids of UbcH5 contain a determinant(s) that is critical for UBC4/UBC5 subfamily members to interact with hect domain proteins cannot be excluded. This possibility was addressed by testing whether or not the N-terminal region of UbcH5 can be functionally replaced by the corresponding region of an unrelated E2. A chimeric protein was constructed consisting of the N-terminal 65-amino acid residues of UbcH1, the human homolog of S. cerevisiaeUBC2RAD6 (28Schneider R. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Schweiger M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1431-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal 85 amino acids of UbcH5 (155; Fig. 1). UbcH1 was used because it had previously been shown that UbcH1 or its Arabidopsis thaliana homolog UBC1 can neither transfer ubiquitin to E6-AP or RSP5 nor support E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination (9Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar, 11Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12148-12154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin thioester assays showed that, although 155 itself can form thioester complexes with ubiquitin with an efficiency similar to that of UbcH5 (data not shown), it was not able to transfer ubiquitin to either E6-AP or RSP5 (Fig. 4). Similarly, 155 was inactive in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination (Fig. 5). Thus, the N-terminal 62 amino acids of UbcH5, as well as the corresponding region of UbcM3, contain a determinant that is required for interaction with hect domain family members. Alignment of various UBCs (not shown) reveals that a phenylalanine residue at position 62 of UbcH5 (Fig. 1A) is conserved among the members of the UBC4/UBC5 subfamily but is not present in any of the other known E2s. For instance, UbcH1 contains an asparagine residue at the corresponding position (Fig. 1A). Therefore, this asparagine residue was substituted by phenylalanine in both UbcH1 (1-N65F) and 155 (155-N65F). Functional analysis of these mutants revealed that 155-N65F interacted with E6-AP with an efficiency similar to UbcH5 in both ubiquitin thioester assays (Fig. 4A) and ubiquitination assays (Fig. 5), whereas 1-N65F was as inactive as UbcH1. The results obtained for RSP5 were slightly different in that 155-N65F was able to transfer ubiquitin to RSP5 but with an approximately 2-fold reduced efficiency compared with UbcH5 (Fig. 4A). Taken together, these results indicate that a phenylalanine residue at position 62 is crucial for the ability of UbcH5 to interact with E6-AP and RSP5. S. cerevisiae UBC4 and UBC5 are involved in stress-related functions (24Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 29Jungmann J. Reins H.-A. Schobert C. Jentsch S. Nature. 1993; 361: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Yeast strains carrying mutations in either one of these genes are viable and lead to only moderate phenotypes, whereasubc4 ubc5 double mutants grow slowly and are inviable at elevated temperatures (24Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that members of the UBC4/UBC5 subfamily of E2s, includingDrosophila UbcD1, can rescue the deficiencies of yeastubc4 ubc5 mutants (30Treier M. Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Zhen M. Heinlein R. Jones D. Jentsch S. Candido E.P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1371-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the genome ofS. cerevisiae does not encode a functional homolog of E6-AP but, in addition to RSP5, encodes four additional hect domain proteins (4Smith S.E. Koegl M. Jentsch S. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 437-446PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the various chimeric E2s were tested for their ability to complement the ubc4 ubc5 phenotype. In yeast, however, the chimeric E2s 35, 335, and 155 and their respective point mutated forms were expressed at vastly different levels. 2U. Nuber, K. Matuschewski, S. Jentsch, and M. Scheffner, unpublished observation. Thus, it was not possible to assess whether the ability of the various chimeric E2s to interact with E6-AP and RSP5 in vitro correlates with their ability to complement the phenotype of ubc4 ubc5 mutantsin vivo. It is assumed that the specificity of ubiquitin-dependent degradation is mediated at least in part by the E2 and E3 enzymes of the ubiquitin conjugation system (1Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar,2Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 4Smith S.E. Koegl M.

Furthermore, it appears that distinct E3s interact only with certain E2s, suggesting that a specific interplay between E2s and E3s contributes to the specificity and selectivity of protein ubiquitination. Members of the hect domain family of putative E3s have been shown to specifically interact in vitro with members of the UBC4/UBC5 subfamily of E2s including human UbcH5 (9Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar, 10Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The mutational analysis of UbcH5 presented in this study shows that the amino acid composition of a region encompassing the thioester-forming cysteine residue (amino acid residues 78–107) and a phenylalanine residue at position 62 are essential determinants for its ability to functionally interact with hect domain proteins. The presence of a phenylalanine residue at the respective position is evolutionally conserved among the members of the UBC4/UBC5 subfamily but is not present in any of the other known E2s. This supports the notion that the ability of UbcH5 and related proteins to interact with hect domain proteins is important for their physiological function. The three-dimensional structure of several class I E2s, includingS. cerevisiae UBC4 and A. thaliana UBC1, the putative homolog of UbcH1 and S. cerevisiaeUBC2RAD6, has been determined (32Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Sullivan M.L. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15116-15121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cook W.J. Jeffrey L.C. Xu Y. Chau V. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13809-13817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This revealed that the overall structure of the UBC domain is conserved and contains four α-helices and a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The putative catalytic site cysteine residue is located in a long extended stretch between the fourth β-strand and the second α-helix. As breakpoints to generate chimeric E2s between UbcH5 and UbcM3 or UbcH1, the amino acid residues at position 62/63, at position 77/78, and at position 107/108 (numbering according to the UbcH5 sequence; Fig. 1) were used. Amino acid residues 62/63 are located in a loop connecting the third and the fourth strand of the β-sheet, whereas amino acid residues 77/78 are located in the stretch between the fourth β-strand and the second α-helix. Such chimeric E2s were expressed in bacteria to appreciable levels and were active in thioester complex formation with ubiquitin. This demonstrates that the fusion between different E2s at these positions does not grossly interfere with proper folding of the resulting chimeric E2s. Amino acid residues 107/108 are located within the second α-helix and thus fusion of the respective parts of different E2s at this site may disturb the overall structure of some of the resulting chimeric E2s. This was clearly not the case for the chimeric E2 353, because it was nearly as active as UbcH5 in transferring ubiquitin to both E6-AP and RSP5, respectively. This shows that the difference between UbcH5 and UbcM3, with respect to their ability to interact with hect domain proteins, is mainly determined by a region surrounding the catalytic site cysteine residue at position 85 of UbcH5. In particular, the presence of a serine residue at position 83 seems to be critical because a mutant form of the chimeric E2 35 bearing a valine at this position, the corresponding amino acid residue of UbcM3, interacts with E6-AP and RSP5 as inefficiently as UbcM3. Conversely, substitution of this valine residue in UbcM3 with serine significantly enhances its ability to interact with E6-AP and RSP5. It is notable that the presence of a bulky hydrophobic residue at position 83 appears to be a peculiarity of UbcM3 and E2s that are highly similar to UbcM3 (26Matuschewski K. Hauser H.-P. Treier M. Jentsch S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2789-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), apparently not being found in other members of the UBC4/UBC5 subfamily as well as in unrelated E2s. Because the cellular functions of UbcM3 and its related E2s are unknown, the significance of this difference is presently unclear. The data obtained with the chimeric E2 353, however, do not exclude the possibility that the C-terminal 40 amino acids of UbcH5/UbcM3 are critically involved in the interaction with E6-AP and RSP5. To address this possibility a chimeric E2 analogous to 353 was generated by replacing the C-terminal UbcM3 part by the corresponding region of UbcH1. However, this chimeric E2 termed 351 was not expressed in bacteria to significant levels. A reasonable explanation for this is that fusion of the C terminus of UbcH1 to the respective part of UbcH5 results in a structural distortion of the resulting chimeric protein. In any case, because of the lack of detectable expression, it cannot be excluded that the C-terminal 40 amino acids of UbcH5/UbcM3 are critically involved in the interaction with E6-AP and RSP5. Based on the results obtained with the chimera 155 and its mutant form 155-N65F, it appears that the N-terminal 61 amino acids of UbcH5 are not critical for its ability to interact with hect domain proteins, as indicated by the fact that this region can be replaced by the corresponding region of a functionally unrelated E2. Although this does not exclude the possibility that the N-terminal region of E2s is directly involved in contacting hect domain proteins, it suggests that this region is required for properties common to all E2s,e.g. interaction with E1 and/or proper folding. The distinct property of UbcH5 to functionally interact with hect domain proteins, however, is determined by its C-terminal 87 amino acid residues. Furthermore, the presence of a phenylalanine residue at position 62 of UbcH5 seems to be of particular importance. Interestingly, all known members of the UBC4/UBC5 subfamily, including UbcM3, contain a phenylalanine residue at the corresponding position, and this seems to be unique to members of this subfamily. The results presented strongly indicate that the presence of a phenylalanine residue at this position is necessary for the ability of an E2 to interact with E6-AP and RSP5. However, it is not sufficient as demonstrated by the results obtained with 1-N65F, a mutant form of UbcH1 in which an asparagine residue at the respective position was replaced by phenylalanine. An essential intermediate step in E6-AP-dependent ubiquitination is the transfer of ubiquitin from UbcH5 to E6-AP resulting in thioester complex formation of E6-AP with ubiquitin (19Scheffner M. Nuber U. Huibregtse J.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that the region of UbcH5 surrounding the putative ubiquitin-donating cysteine residue at position 85 is critical for the ability of UbcH5 to functionally interact with E6-AP and RSP5 and presumably with hect domain proteins in general. SCF complexes also have E3 activity (14Feldman R.M. Corell C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 15Skowyra D. Craig K.L. Tyers M. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Cell. 1997; 91: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) but, unlike hect domain proteins, SCF complexes do not appear to form thioester complexes with ubiquitin but instead function as docking proteins by stably binding both substrate proteins and their cognate E2, UBC3CDC34. UBC3CDC34 is a class II enzyme containing a C-terminal extension of approximately 70 amino acids in addition to the UBC domain (34Goebl M.G. Yochem J. Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Byers B. Science. 1988; 241: 1331-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that in SCF-dependent ubiquitination the final transfer of ubiquitin to substrates is probably directly catalyzed by UBC3CDC34, the interaction of SCF complexes with UBC3CDC34 is not mediated by the UBC domain. Rather, it was shown that the C-terminal extension of UBC3CDC34 is necessary and sufficient to mediate its interaction with SCF complexes (18Mathias N. Steussy C.N. Goebl M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4040-4045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that, according to their mode of action, different E3 proteins recognize different regions on their cognate E2s. Interestingly, it was recently reported that UBC4 is involved in UBR1-dependent ubiquitination of certain proteins (35Byrd C. Turner G.C. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). UBR1 was originally isolated as an E3 that, in conjunction with UBC2RAD6, mediates the recognition of substrates according to the N-end rule (8Bartel B. Wünning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 36Dohmen R.J. Madura K. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although UBR1 does not appear to be related to hect domain proteins at the amino acid sequence level, it has been reported that UBR1 can form thioester complexes with ubiquitin (5Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see whether this property of UBR1 requires the activity of UBC4/UBC5 and whether the regions of UBC4/UBC5 that are required for interaction with hect domain proteins are also involved in the interaction with UBR1.

https://openalex.org/W2046121936,"GH3 cells showed spontaneous rhythmic oscillations in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and spontaneous prolactin release. The L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor nimodipine reduced the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations at lower concentrations (100nm–1 μm), whereas at higher concentrations (10 μm), it completely abolished them. Ca2+ oscillations persisted following exposure to thapsigargin, indicating that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores were not required for spontaneous activity. The K+ channel inhibitors Ba2+, Cs+, and tetraethylammonium (TEA) had distinct effects on different K+ currents, as well as on Ca2+oscillations and prolactin release. Cs+ inhibited the inward rectifier K+ current (KIR) and increased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations. TEA inhibited outward K+ currents activated at voltages above –40 mV (grouped within the category of Ca2+ and voltage-activated currents, KCa,V) and increased the amplitude of Ca2+oscillations. Ba2+ inhibited both KIR and KCa,V and increased both the amplitude and the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations. Prolactin release was increased by Ba2+ and Cs+ but not by TEA. These results indicate that L-type Ca2+ channels and KIRchannels modulate the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations and prolactin release, whereas TEA-sensitive KCa,V channels modulate the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations without altering prolactin release. Differential regulation of these channels can produce frequency or amplitude modulation of calcium signaling that stimulates specific pituitary cell functions. GH3 cells showed spontaneous rhythmic oscillations in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and spontaneous prolactin release. The L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor nimodipine reduced the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations at lower concentrations (100nm–1 μm), whereas at higher concentrations (10 μm), it completely abolished them.

These results indicate that L-type Ca2+ channels and KIRchannels modulate the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations and prolactin release, whereas TEA-sensitive KCa,V channels modulate the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations without altering prolactin release. Differential regulation of these channels can produce frequency or amplitude modulation of calcium signaling that stimulates specific pituitary cell functions. There is increasing evidence for distinct roles of different spatial and temporal patterns of intracellular free Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i) in the regulation of cellular processes (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Many cell types exhibit oscillations of [Ca2+]i that may be differentially modulated to produce highly specific intracellular signals. For example, the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations has been shown to regulate secretion, whereas the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations has been shown to regulate gene expression in different cell systems (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar,2Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). The multifunctional enzyme calmodulin kinase II has been shown to be capable of decoding different patterns of Ca2+ signaling into different functional responses. (3De Koninck P. Schulman H. Science. 1998; 279: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). Endocrine cells have the intrinsic capacity for extensive spontaneous activity that is independent of stimulation by external factors. In pituitary cells, this activity is characterized by membrane potential oscillations, action potentials, and Ca2+ oscillations (4Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 5Wagner K.A. Yacono P.W. Golan D.E. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochem.

J. 1995; 69: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is likely that this spontaneous, intrinsic signaling plays a role in basal hormone release by pituitary cells and other endocrine cells, although this role has yet to be clearly defined (8Malgaroli A. Meldolesi J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 283: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Miki H. Maercklein P.B. Fitzpatrick L.A.

Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, the individual components of this intrinsic signaling may be targets of modulation through which diverse signals can induce specific changes in cellular activity and hormone release. The rat pituitary growth hormone- and prolactin-secreting GH3 cell line is a useful and well studied model system for the study of pituitary cell signaling. GH3 cells express L-type Ca2+ channels as well as inwardly rectifying and Ca2+- and voltage-activated K+ channels. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of these channels have been extensively characterized in previous studies (11Shangold G.A. Kongsamut S. Miller R.J. Life Sci. 1985; 36: 2209-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 12Matteson D.R. Armstrong C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 87: 161-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Simasko S.M.

Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1041-1049PubMed Google Scholar). GH3cells also show spontaneous activity that is generated by the coordinated action of ion channels, Ca2+ influx, Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, and other second messengers including IP3 1The abbreviations used are: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; TEA, tetraethylammonium and cAMP. In these and other pituitary cells, the relative contributions of each of these cellular signaling components to overall cellular activity may vary from cell to cell and under stimulated versusunstimulated conditions (20Kukuljan M. Rojas E. Catt K.J. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4860-4865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gollasch M. Haller H. Schultz G. Hescheler J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1994; 428: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It is well established that increases in [Ca2+]i directly mediate hormone release in GH3 cells and other endocrine cell types (10Masumoto N. Tasaka K. Mizuki J. Fukami K. Ikebuchi Y. Miyake A. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 23Tse F.W. Tse A. Hille B. Horstmann H. Almers W. Neuron. 1997; 18: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Tse A. Tse F.W. Almers W. Hille B. Science. 1993; 260: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Oscillatory patterns of Ca2+ signaling provide the opportunity for a cell to respond to individual components of a Ca2+ signal (e.g. base-line [Ca2+]i, oscillation frequency, oscillation duration, or oscillation amplitude). The functional response of the cell may be different if it depends on a “frequency-modulated” signal versus an “amplitude-modulated” signal (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Individual ion channels and second messengers may play specific roles in generating specific patterns of spontaneous Ca2+signaling and in turn may generate different patterns of hormone release. In this study, we have used the combination of patch clamp measurements, fluorescence imaging of intracellular Ca2+concentration, and a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for prolactin to study the ionic mechanisms controlling hormone release from GH3 cells. We have investigated the role of specific patterns of spontaneous Ca2+ signaling in prolactin release from GH3 cells by using Ca2+and K+ channel antagonists to modulate the patterns of Ca2+ signaling. GH3 cells, obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA (CCL 82.1), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, penicillin (0.05 IU/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) and incubated in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% O2 at 37 °C. Cells were harvested once a week by treatment with a phosphate-buffered saline containing EDTA (1 mm) and reseeded at 20% original density, either into 6-well plates for prolactin release assays, 35-mm diameter culture dishes for electrophysiological studies, or poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips for Ca2+-imaging studies. The incubation medium was changed every 2–3 days. Single cells were voltage-clamped, and voltage-activated K+ channel activity was recorded from whole GH3 cells using a List EPC-7 patch-clamp amplifier. For the recording of KCa,V channel activity, cells were superfused with a solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 6 mm glucose, 5 × 10−4 mm tetrodotoxin (pH 7.2 with NaOH). The recording electrode contained 120 mm KCl, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm Mg-ATP, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH) (all from Sigma). Currents were activated by step depolarizations of membrane potential from a holding potential of −80 mV for 100 ms every 10 s. Capacitance compensations were achieved using the patch-clamp amplifier. Residual artifacts and leakage currents were nulled using a P/4 subtraction. Whole-cell KIR current recordings were performed using extracellular solutions containing 140 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 7 mm glucose, 5 × 10−4 mm tetrodotoxin (pH 7.2 with KOH). The solution in the recording electrode contained 140 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm Mg-ATP (pH 7.2 with KOH). Currents were evoked by hyperpolarizing from a −40 mV holding potential (duration 1.5 s, frequency 0.03 Hz). No leak subtraction was employed in these experiments. [Ca2+]i was measured using a fluorescence imaging system that has previously been described in detail (25Charles A.C. Merrill J.E. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 983-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on poly(d-lysine)-coated glass coverslips were loaded with fura2 by incubation in 5 μm fura2-AM for 40 min. Cells were then washed and maintained in normal medium for 30 min before experimentation. Coverslips were excited with a mercury lamp through 340- and 380-nm band-pass filters, and fluorescence at 510 nm was recorded through a 10× or 20× objective with a silicon intensified target camera to an optical memory disc recorder. Images were then digitized and subjected to background subtraction and shading correction, after which [Ca2+]i was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis, as described previously, by a frame grabber and image analysis board (Data Translation). Data acquisition and analysis software were written by Dr. Michael Sanderson. Tracings in all figures are based upon fluorescence of a 4 × 4 pixel area located within each cell body. Experiments were carried out in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4 (HBSS/HEPES) at 22 °C. Agents were applied by perfusion of coverslips with at least 2 ml of HBSS/HEPES containing the particular agent. A competitive ELISA has been developed for measuring prolactin secreted by GH3 cells. The assay utilizes an antibody (raised in rabbit) against rat prolactin. Both antisera (prolactinS-9) and standards (prolactin RP-3) were kindly provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). For the collection of samples, GH3 cells were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates 2 days before experiments (0.5–0.7 million cells/well). Release experiments were conducted at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Immediately before each experiment, cells were washed gently with media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, with NaOH). After washing, aliquots of media (1 ml) were added to each well for 0.5-h time points such that release could be monitored before, during, and after exposure to drugs. The amount of prolactin (ng/ml/106 cells) released in 0.5 h in the presence of drugs was expressed as a percentage of release from the same cells during 0.5 h under control conditions before exposure to drugs. After incubation with the cells, each media aliquot was centrifuged at 1800 rpm at 4 °C then stored at −20 °C or assayed directly by ELISA for prolactin. For the competitive prolactin ELISA, 96-well Nunc-Immuno Maxisorp Plates from Life Sciences, Denver, CO were used. Each well was coated with prolactin by incubation of 100 μl of 0.1 mNaHCO3, pH 9.5, containing 1 ng of prolactin for 20–24 h at 4 °C. Before assay, prolactin-coated plates were washed with assay buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH to 7.4, then incubated with assay buffer for 30 min at room temperature to remove prolactin binding weakly to the plate. After further washing with assay buffer, undiluted samples (100 μl) or standards (0.02–40 ng) dissolved in 100 μl of media were added to the wells, followed by the addition of 50 μl of prolactin antibody at a dilution of 1:40,000. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, bound antibody was detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Vector, Burlingame, Ca) with tetramethylbenzidine (Life Technologies, Inc.) as substrate. The peroxidase reaction was terminated by 1 n H2SO4, and absorbance was measured by a microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at 450 nm. To determine the amount of prolactin present in the samples, a standard curve was generated. The percent of maximum absorbance (corresponding to no prolactin added) was plotted against known amounts of prolactin (0.02–40 ng). All samples were assayed in quadruplicates from three separate determinations. The majority of GH3 cells (approximately 70%,n > 1500 cells in 50 experiments) showed spontaneous oscillations in [Ca2+]i. The pattern of these oscillations in [Ca2+]i varied considerably from cell to cell. Ca2+ oscillations had a periodicity ranging from 3–30 s and a peak amplitude ranging from 40–300 nmin different cells. Some cells showed Ca2+ oscillations with a relatively consistent frequency, amplitude, and shape (e.g. Fig. 1, Cell #2), whereas other cells showed a more random pattern of oscillations (e.g. Fig. 1, Cell #28). Increasing the temperature of the bath solution from room temperature to 37 °C increased the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations but did not result in any qualitative changes in spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations or in their response to the conditions described below (data not shown). Ca2+ oscillations were completely abolished in all cells during perfusion with medium containing no added Ca2+, and they were restored immediately upon replacement of Ca2+(n = 120 cells in three experiments, data not shown). We have previously shown that GH3 cells show predominantly L-type Ca2+ currents that are inhibited by nimodipine (19Piros E.T. Prather P.L. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Evans C.J. Hales T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1041-1049PubMed Google Scholar). Nimodipine inhibited spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 1). Nimodipine (1 μm) reduced the frequency of Ca2+oscillations in some cells and abolished them in other cells. Interestingly, although 1 μm nimodipine reduced the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in some cells, in most of these cells it did not significantly affect their amplitude. Nimodipine (10 μm) abolished Ca2+ oscillations in all cells (n = 100 cells in three experiments). Nimodipine (10 μm) also reduced spontaneous prolactin release by 32.9 ± 9.1% (see Fig. 9). The persistence of prolactin release despite the abolition of Ca2+ oscillations shows that a significant portion of the spontaneous hormone release does not require spontaneous Ca2+ signaling. Exposure to 1 μm thapsigargin resulted in an increase in base-line [Ca2+]i and a slight increase in the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations in most cells (n = 120 cells in four experiments). Base-line [Ca2+]i returned to previous levels after 3–5 min in thapsigargin. After exposure to thapsigargin, Ca2+oscillations continued to occur in 69% of cells showing spontaneous oscillations (59/87 cells in three experiments), although in some cells their amplitude and frequency were reduced (Fig. 2). The phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 had no significant effect on Ca2+ oscillations, suggesting that the active formation of IP3 is not required for spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations (n = 100 cells in three experiments, data not shown). The activity of both thapsigargin and U73122 were verified by the observation that each agent completely inhibited the rapid peak increase in [Ca2+]i induced by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (data not shown). These results show that the activity of phospholipase C and the release of thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ are not required for spontaneous Ca2+oscillations in most cells but may contribute to modulation of their frequency and amplitude. The effect of nimodipine suggests that Ca2+ oscillations are generated by spontaneous depolarizations with resultant influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated channels. Consistent with this hypothesis, spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations were highly sensitive to depolarization induced by increasing extracellular [K+]. Increasing extracellular [K+] by as little as 3 mm resulted in a increase in base-line [Ca2+]i as well as an increase in the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations (n = 100 cells in three experiments, not shown). GH3 cells display multiple types of K+currents, including an inward rectifying (KIR) current and outward currents mediated by Ca2+ and voltage-activated channels (15Oxford G.S. Wagoner P.K. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1989; 410: 587-612Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Dubinsky J.M. Oxford G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(Lond.). 1987; 385: 611-625Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the purposes of this study, the different outward K+ currents recorded were grouped into a single category of Ca2+ and voltage-activated (KCa,V) currents. KCa,V channel activity was recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration by depolarizing GH3cells held at −80 mV to between −50 and 60 mV in 10-mV increments (Fig. 3). Using the specified internal and external solutions (see “Experimental Procedures”), outward K+ currents were observed with a threshold of activation of approximately −40 mV. Different recording solutions (see “Experimental Procedures”) and hyperpolarizing steps from a −40 mV holding potential to between −50 and −120 mV (10 mV decrements) were used to specifically activate currents mediated by KIRchannels. KIR channel activity recorded at more depolarized potentials than −40 mV was overwhelmed by currents through KCa,V channels. KIR and KCa,Vcurrents were inhibited selectively by different agents (Fig. 4). TEA (1 mm) inhibited outward KCa,V currents but not KIR currents. The outward K+ currents had both transient and sustained components; the inhibition of outward K+ current by TEA was most marked at the end of the voltage step, indicating a relatively selective block of the sustained current component. Ba2+ (1 mm) inhibited both KIR and KCa,V(with no obvious specificity for the transient or sustained components), whereas Cs+ inhibited only KIRcurrents (Fig. 4).Figure 4The effect of K+ channel antagonists on KCa,V and KIR channels in GH3 cells. A, control and Ba2+(1 mm)-inhibited KCa,V currents. Ba2+-inhibited peak and sustained current components indicating blockade of both a transient A current and longer lasting currents, consistent with delayed rectifying and Ca2+-activated K+ currents. B, TEA (10 mm) predominantly inhibited the sustained current component. In both A and B, superimposed traces are the averages of two currents activated by depolarizing from –80 to 0 mV in the presence and absence of the inhibitors indicated.

TEA (1 mm) induced a marked increase in the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations, a small increase in their frequency, and had no significant effect on base-line [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5; see Fig. 8). By contrast, Ba2+ (1 mm) induced a marked increase in base-line [Ca2+]i as well as a significant increase in the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations and a small but significant increase in the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 6; see Fig. 8). Cs+ caused a significant increase in the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations as well as a slight increase in base-line [Ca2+]i but had no significant effect on the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8).

TEA had no significant effect on prolactin release. By contrast, Ba2+evoked a large increase in prolactin release, whereas Cs+evoked a small but significant increase in prolactin release. GH3 cells show spontaneous activity characterized by rhythmic Ca2+ oscillations and prolactin release. Ca2+ channels, K+ channels, Ca2+influx, and release of intracellular Ca2+ play distinct roles in this spontaneous activity. A number of previous studies have demonstrated a primary role for release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in the spontaneous and stimulated activity of pituitary cells (20Kukuljan M. Rojas E.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9750-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our results show that spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in GH3 cells are completely dependent on influx of Ca2+ and in the majority of cells, do not require release of intracellular Ca2+ from thapsigargin-sensitive stores. The efficacy of thapsigargin in depleting Ca2+ stores was verified by the complete inhibition of the peak increase in [Ca2+]i in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone, as reported previously by Nelson and Hinkle (31Nelson E.J. Hinkle P.M. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1084-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The frequency and amplitude of Ca2+oscillations were diminished in some cells in response to thapsigargin, suggesting that intracellular Ca2+ stores may play a modulatory rather than a primary role in Ca2+ oscillations. This modulatory role may involve Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release through interaction of Ca2+ with the IP3 receptor (28Li Y.X. Keizer J. Stojilkovic S.S. Rinzel J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1079-C1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tse F.W. Tse A. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9750-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Tse A. Tse F.W. Hille B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 477: 511-525Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin did abolish spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in a significant proportion of cells (approximately 30%), suggesting that there is a subset of cells whose spontaneous Ca2+ signaling does require intracellular Ca2+ release from thapsigargin-sensitive stores. A similar dependence on IP3-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores in a subset of GH3 cells is suggested by Varney et al. (33Varney M.A. Galione A. Watson S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), who found that chronic treatment with Li2+, which reduces basal levels of IP3, decreased the number of cells showing spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations. The effects of nimodipine indicate that spontaneous Ca2+oscillations are generated by influx of Ca2+ through L-type channels that have previously been shown to be inhibited by nimodipine in GH3 cells (19Piros E.T. Prather P.L. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Evans C.J. Hales T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1041-1049PubMed Google Scholar). At lower concentrations, nimodipine often reduced the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations without significantly altering their amplitude. This observation suggests that the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations is dependent upon the activation state of Ca2+ channels, whereas the base-to-peak amplitude of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations is an all-or-none phenomenon that is not regulated by the state of Ca2+ channels under unstimulated conditions. The central role of Ca2+ channels in the overall activity of the cell makes them a logical target for inhibitory or excitatory modulation by external ligands. The observations that somatostatin receptors and expressed opioid receptors in GH3 cells modulate Ca2+ channels is consistent with their role as a target for receptor-mediated modulation (19Piros E.T. Prather P.L. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Evans C.J. Hales T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1041-1049PubMed Google Scholar, 34Piros E.T. Prather P.L. Law P.Y. Evans C.J. Hales T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 947-956PubMed Google Scholar). Nimodipine inhibited basal prolactin release by approximately 30%, indicating that a significant proportion of basal prolactin release is stimulated by spontaneous Ca2+ signaling. However, the persistence of prolactin release in the absence of any detectable Ca2+ signaling shows that a high proportion of basal prolactin release is independent of spontaneous Ca2+oscillations. This finding is consistent with the report of Masumoto et al.(10), who found that basal exocytosis continued in the absence of increases in [Ca2+]i in pituitary gonadotrophs. It is likely that this represents an unregulated pathway of secretion that has been reported in GH3 cells (35Varro A. Nemeth J. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. Dockray G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and other cell types. Different K+ channel antagonists have distinct effects on Ca2+ signaling in GH3 cells. TEA evoked a dramatic increase in the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations; this effect is likely because of prolongation of the action potential and subsequent increase in the action potential-induced influx of Ca2+. This is consistent with the relatively selective effect TEA has on sustained outward K+ currents recorded from GH3 cells, with little effect on the A current (15Oxford G.S. Wagoner P.K. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1989; 410: 587-612Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the large increase in the amplitude of Ca2+oscillations was not associated with a large increase in base-line [Ca2+]i, showing that base-line [Ca2+]i is regulated by a mechanism other than TEA-sensitive outward K+ currents. Both Ba2+and Cs+ increased the frequency of Ca2+oscillations, whereas TEA did not. These results indicate that the inward rectifier K+ channel plays a primary role in setting the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations. They are consistent with the results of Barros et al. (36Barros F. Villalobos C. Garcia-Sancho J. del Camino D. de la Pena P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 426: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Barros F. del Camino D. Pardo L.A. de la Pena P. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 431: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), who report a primary role for the inward rectifier in the regulation of GH3 cell excitability. Base-line [Ca2+]i was increased dramatically by Ba2+, and to a lesser extent, by Cs+ and TEA. These results suggest that Ba2+ modulates base-line [Ca2+]i by a mechanism that is distinct from the inward rectifier, and as discussed above, distinct from TEA-sensitive outward K+ currents. Prolactin release was also differentially modulated by different K+ channel antagonists. Despite the fact that TEA caused a marked increase in the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations and a significant increase in average [Ca2+]i, it did not increase prolactin release. By contrast, Cs+, which increased the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations but caused a much smaller increase in average [Ca2+]i than TEA, did cause a significant increase in prolactin release. These findings are consistent with the stimulation of hormone release by an increase in the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations but not in their amplitude. The marked effect of Ba2+suggests that the combination of increased base-line [Ca2+]i and increased Ca2+oscillation frequency can cause a much greater increase in hormone release than increased Ca2+ oscillation frequency alone. Simultaneous measurements of membrane capacitance and [Ca2+]i by multiple investigators have provided strong evidence that each oscillatory increase in [Ca2+]i is capable of evoking secretion of hormone (24Tse A. Tse F.W. Almers W. Hille B. Science. 1993; 260: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 38Thomas P. Waring D.W. J. Physiol.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 81-92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that increasing the peak [Ca2+]i associated with each spontaneous Ca2+ oscillation does not increase hormone release; this may be because there is a maximum number of vesicles released per Ca2+ oscillation once the peak [Ca2+]i has reached a certain threshold or because buffering of Ca2+ prevents this increased peak [Ca2+]i from being sensed by the secretory apparatus. By contrast, the increase in hormone release associated with an increase in Ca2+ oscillation frequency suggests that modulation of Ca2+ oscillation frequency does represent a mechanism for stimulation of hormone release. Increasing base-line [Ca2+]i, in addition to increasing Ca2+ oscillation frequency, results in a further increase in prolactin release. Possible explanations for the specific effects of base-line [Ca2+]i and oscillation frequency on secretion include direct effects on the exocytotic trigger mechanism (43Heinemann C. von Ruden L. Chow R.H. Neher E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 424: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) or the recruitment of additional pools of vesicles with different Ca2+ sensitivities (44Horrigan F.T. Bookman R.J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1119-1129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 45Giovannucci D.R. Stuenkel E.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 498: 735-751Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Ca2+ channels, K+ channels, Ca2+influx, and intracellular Ca2+ release play specific roles in the generation of spontaneous activity in GH3 cells. In turn, specific characteristics of spontaneous Ca2+signaling, namely base-line [Ca2+]i and the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations, are correlated with changes in hormone release. Our studies identify L-type Ca2+channels and the inward rectifier K+ channel as key components of the cellular signaling machinery whose modulation results in the specific changes in the patterns of spontaneous cellular activity that regulate changes in basal prolactin release. TEA-sensitive outward K+ currents may affect other cellular processes through amplitude-modulated Ca2+ signaling."

That is, relative rates of PRPS2 transcription in normal cells were substantially greater in lymphoblasts than in fibroblasts, but for both lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, relative rates of PRPS2transcription in normal and patient cells were indistinguishable. Consistency was also found in the relative differences between normal and patient cells in each of the processes mediating flow of genetic information from PRPS1 transcription to maximal PRS1 isoform expression (enzyme activity at 32 mm Pi). This finding, in conjunction with the demonstration that patient and normal cells did not differ in PRS1 mRNA or isoform structure or in alternative pretranslational mechanisms that might otherwise explain PRS1 isoform overexpression, supports the contentions that PRS1 isoform concentrations are determined, at least in major part, at the level of transcription and that an inherited increase in PRPS1transcription rate provides the basis for the increase in the concentration of the normal PRS1 isoform in cells of affected individuals.The genetic basis of inherited acceleration of PRPS1transcription remains to be determined.

In addition to extended PRPS1 5′-flanking region sequencing, functional analysis of the PRPS1 promoter and adjacent 5′-flanking DNA, comparing PRPS1 promoter-plasmid construct expression in normal and patient cells, should prove helpful in distinguishing among these possibilities.Prior studies (3Becker M.A. Kim M.

Within this regulatory domain, purine nucleotides inhibit both reactions (3Becker M.A. Kim M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1973; 248: 6035-6040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although fibroblasts with either regulatory defects in PRS or overactivity of normal PRS share the biochemical hallmarks of PRS superactivity, increased rates of PRPP and purine synthesis and increased intracellular purine nucleotide concentrations, defect-specific differences in the intracellular control of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis are apparent (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the case of PRS regulatory superactivity, where PRS activity in cell extracts or purified enzyme preparations are resistant to purine nucleotide inhibition, accelerated rates of intracellular PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis are refractory to inhibition by exogenous purine base precursors of purine nucleotides or by endogenous increases in purine nucleotide concentrations (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in cells bearing PRS1s with any of an array of point mutations (21Becker M.S. Smith P.R. Taylor W. Mustafi R. Switzer R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), in vitrodefects in allosteric regulation of PRS1 activities are paralleled by dysregulation of PRPP and purine synthesis. In contrast, allosteric regulation of PRS activity is normal in enzyme preparations from fibroblasts with overactivity of normal PRS, and suppression of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis in response to purine base addition is intact in the corresponding cells (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these cells express increased rates of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis.The apparent paradox of increased rates of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis in fibroblasts with overactivity of normal PRS catalytic superactivity despite increased purine nucleotide inhibitor pools and normal allosteric regulation of PRS activity (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is best resolved by the view that the increased concentration of the normal PRS1 isoform (24Becker M.A. Taylor W. Smith P.R. Ahmed M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19894-19899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) results in a rate of PRPP synthesis sufficient to activate amidophosphoribosyltransferase despite coexisting increased levels of inhibitory purine nucleotides (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this formulation are the substantially more modest increases in rates of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis in fibroblasts with intact allosteric regulation than in cells in which mutations in PRPS1 impair this control mechanism (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although intact allosteric inhibition apparently modulates expression of PRPP and purine overproduction in fibroblasts with excessive PRS1 isoform, this regulatory mechanism is insufficient to overcome the excessive expression of enzyme activity resulting from acceleration of PRPS1 transcription. The current studies provide, then, an example of a circumstance in which transcription of PRPS1 is a major determinant of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthetic rates.

In the case of regulatory defects, for example, patient-derived PRS1 cDNAs bear point mutations encoding recombinant mutant PRS1s with altered allosteric properties (resistance to noncompetitive purine nucleotide inhibition and increased sensitivity to Pi activation) characteristic of those of PRS in cells from the respective affected individual (21Becker M.S.

Although fibroblasts with either regulatory defects in PRS or overactivity of normal PRS share the biochemical hallmarks of PRS superactivity, increased rates of PRPP and purine synthesis and increased intracellular purine nucleotide concentrations, defect-specific differences in the intracellular control of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis are apparent (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the case of PRS regulatory superactivity, where PRS activity in cell extracts or purified enzyme preparations are resistant to purine nucleotide inhibition, accelerated rates of intracellular PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis are refractory to inhibition by exogenous purine base precursors of purine nucleotides or by endogenous increases in purine nucleotide concentrations (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in cells bearing PRS1s with any of an array of point mutations (21Becker M.S. Smith P.R. Taylor W. Mustafi R. Switzer R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), in vitrodefects in allosteric regulation of PRS1 activities are paralleled by dysregulation of PRPP and purine synthesis. In contrast, allosteric regulation of PRS activity is normal in enzyme preparations from fibroblasts with overactivity of normal PRS, and suppression of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis in response to purine base addition is intact in the corresponding cells (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, these cells express increased rates of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis.The apparent paradox of increased rates of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis in fibroblasts with overactivity of normal PRS catalytic superactivity despite increased purine nucleotide inhibitor pools and normal allosteric regulation of PRS activity (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is best resolved by the view that the increased concentration of the normal PRS1 isoform (24Becker M.A. Taylor W. Smith P.R. Ahmed M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19894-19899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) results in a rate of PRPP synthesis sufficient to activate amidophosphoribosyltransferase despite coexisting increased levels of inhibitory purine nucleotides (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this formulation are the substantially more modest increases in rates of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthesis in fibroblasts with intact allosteric regulation than in cells in which mutations in PRPS1 impair this control mechanism (16Becker M.A. Losman M.J. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although intact allosteric inhibition apparently modulates expression of PRPP and purine overproduction in fibroblasts with excessive PRS1 isoform, this regulatory mechanism is insufficient to overcome the excessive expression of enzyme activity resulting from acceleration of PRPS1 transcription. The current studies provide, then, an example of a circumstance in which transcription of PRPS1 is a major determinant of PRPP and purine nucleotide synthetic rates. The current studies provide evidence for a selectively increased rate of transcription of PRPS1 as the pretranslational aberration underlying increased expression of the normal PRS1 isoform in inherited PRS overactivity. In each of the fibroblast strains and lymphoblast lines cultured from affected individuals, transcription ofPRPS1 was consistently greater relative to that ofGAPDH than was the case in corresponding normal cells. Although the relative increases in PRPS1 transcription rates were greater in patient fibroblasts than lymphoblasts, study of the latter cell type permitted a more accurate demonstration of the selectivity of accelerated PRPS1 transcription. That is, relative rates of PRPS2 transcription in normal cells were substantially greater in lymphoblasts than in fibroblasts, but for both lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, relative rates of PRPS2transcription in normal and patient cells were indistinguishable. Consistency was also found in the relative differences between normal and patient cells in each of the processes mediating flow of genetic information from PRPS1 transcription to maximal PRS1 isoform expression (enzyme activity at 32 mm Pi). This finding, in conjunction with the demonstration that patient and normal cells did not differ in PRS1 mRNA or isoform structure or in alternative pretranslational mechanisms that might otherwise explain PRS1 isoform overexpression, supports the contentions that PRS1 isoform concentrations are determined, at least in major part, at the level of transcription and that an inherited increase in PRPS1transcription rate provides the basis for the increase in the concentration of the normal PRS1 isoform in cells of affected individuals. The genetic basis of inherited acceleration of PRPS1transcription remains to be determined. Sequence identity of patient and normal PRPS1 DNAs in the 850-bp region 5′ to the consensus transcription initiation site (32Ishizuka T. Iizasa T. Taira M. Ishijima S. Sonoda T. Shimada H.

Among alternative possibilities to explain accelerated PRPS1 transcription are mutations in a more remote promoter element, either in contiguity with the immediate 5′-flanking sequence (42Berg P.I. Mittelman M. Elion J. Labie D. Schechter A.N. Am. J. Hematol. 1991; 36: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or even substantially distant (43Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar); in a cis-acting element within or adjacent to the PRPS1 gene, such as an intronic enhancer or suppressor (44Aranow B. Silbiger R.N. Dusing M.R. Stock J.L. Yager K.L. Potter S. Hutton J.J. Wiginton D.A. Mol. Cell.

Pirastu M. Blood. 1992; 79: 512-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); or in a trans-acting gene influencing the regulation of PRPS1 transcription. In any case, X chromosome-linked transmission of PRS catalytic superactivity (14Yen R.C.K. Adams W.B. Lazar C. Becker M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) favors the view that the primary defect altering PRPS1 transcription is itself X-linked. In addition to extended PRPS1 5′-flanking region sequencing, functional analysis of the PRPS1 promoter and adjacent 5′-flanking DNA, comparing PRPS1 promoter-plasmid construct expression in normal and patient cells, should prove helpful in distinguishing among these possibilities.

Within this regulatory domain, purine nucleotides inhibit both reactions (3Becker M.A. Kim M. J. Biol.

HS1 1The abbreviations used are: HS1, hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein; SH, Src homology; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1The abbreviations used are: HS1, hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein; SH, Src homology; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is an intracellular protein with expression that is limited to hematopoietic and lymphoid cells (1Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Miyagoe Y. Ariyasu T. Watanabe T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9367-9379PubMed Google Scholar). The gene sequence shows that is composed of 486 amino acids with a predicted Mr of ∼54 kDa. In contrast, HS1 has been constantly isolated as a protein with an apparentMr of ∼75 kDa, as judged from SDS-PAGE, giving rise to the suggestion that it might be heavily affected by post-translational modifications, e.g. glycosylation (1Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Miyagoe Y. Ariyasu T. Watanabe T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9367-9379PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of HS1 contains a variety of structurally significant motifs, including an N-terminal region responsible for the binding of mitochondrial protein HS1-associated protein X-1 (2Suzuki Y. Demoliere C. Kitamura D. Takeshita H. Deuschle U. Watanabe T. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2736-2744PubMed Google Scholar), followed by four 37-amino acids repeats that can form a helix-turn-helix structure frequently found in the DNA binding domain of various transcriptional factors (1Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Miyagoe Y. Ariyasu T. Watanabe T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9367-9379PubMed Google Scholar); this region contains three putative phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding motifs and has been suggested to be involved in F-actin binding (3He H.

Evidence that HS1 plays a role in the receptor-mediated apoptosis and proliferative responses was provided by the analysis of HS1-deficient mice (4Taniuki I. Kitamura K. Maekawa Y. Fukuda T. Kishi H. Watanabe T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3664-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and WEH1–231 B lymphoma cells (5Benhamou L.E. Watanabe T. Kitamura D. Cazenave P.A. Sarthou P. Eur. J.

The observation that HS1 is readily tyrosine phosphorylated after B cell antigen receptor cross-linking, in parallel with activation of Src family kinases (8Yamanashi Y. Okada M. Semba T. Yamori T.

Kawakami T. Kawakami Y. Herren B. Mayumi M. Immunol. Lett. 1993; 40: 65-71Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), is also consistent with a role for HS1 in signal transduction.In vitro studies revealed that HS1 is not a substrate for the Src-related kinases c-Fgr, Lyn, and Fyn unless it is previously phosphorylated by the Src-unrelated protein-tyrosine kinase Syk (10Brunati A.M. Ruzzene M. James P. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,11Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Syk-mediated phosphorylation affects tyrosyl residues located just upstream from the SH3 domain (notably Tyr-378 and Tyr-397) and generates high affinity binding sites for Src family SH2 domains (12Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). This provides the structural basis for subsequent association with and secondary phosphorylation by c-Fgr, Lyn, and Fyn (11Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of this sequential mode of HS1 phosphorylation described in vitro has been recently corroborated by the observation that in intact hematopoietic cells protein-tyrosine kinases Syk and Lyn synergistically phosphorylate HS1. Furthermore, mutation of Tyr-378 and Tyr-397 to Phe has shown that they are the residues critical for B cell antigen receptor-induced phosphorylation, and their mutation rendered the cell insensitive to apoptotic stimuli (6Fukuda T. Kitamura D. Taniuchi I. Maekawa Y. Benhamou L.E. Sarthou P. Watanabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7302-7306Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Yamanashi Y. Fukuda T.

These findings prompted us to undertake a study aimed at unraveling the structural features that underlie the sequential mode of HS1 phosphorylation. Here we show that a minimum core of HS1, including the primary and secondary sites of phosphorylation at its C- and N-terminal edges, respectively, but lacking the whole SH3 domain, the HS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) binding motif, and the putative helix-turn-helix region, is still able to undergo the entire process of sequential phosphorylation as efficiently as full-length HS1. We also show that the molecular mass of HS1 is not altered by post-translational modifications, consistent with the concept that abnormally high Mr rather reflects marked asymmetry and rigidity of the protein.

The synthesis of peptides NEMEAPTTAYKKTTP and KGGRSLRPLPPLPPPG was performed using an ABI 431-A automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with 9-fluorenilmethoxycarbonyl chemistry according a protocol detailed elsewhere (17Marin O. Meggio F. Sarno S. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7192-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A 2-chlorotrityl resin (Novabiochem), preloaded with C-terminal proline, was used as solid support for the synthesis of NEMEAPTTAYKKTTP. The crude peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Prep Nova-Pak HR C18 preparative reverse phase column, 6 μm, 25 × 10 mm (Waters). Analytical high performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time of flight mass spectrometry analysis of the purified peptides showed the correctly predicted mass and a purity of 90%. HS1 sequences encoding amino acids 1–486 and 208–486, respectively, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human wild type HS1 cDNA (kindly provided by T. Watanabe) (1Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Miyagoe Y. Ariyasu T. Watanabe T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9367-9379PubMed Google Scholar) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), and cloned as BamHI-PstI fragments into the same sites of pTrcHis vector (Invitrogen). Vectors containing the HS1 inserts were cleaved with BamHI and XhoI situated at position 401 of the HS1 sequence. The HS1 fragments encoding amino acids 1–401 and 208–401 were cloned again into pTrcHis. Recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (10Brunati A.M. Ruzzene M. James P. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The His tag was cleaved by enterokinase Max (Invitrogen), and the digested proteins were purified by nickel-nitrolotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen). Recombinant proteins (20 μg) were phosphorylated by p38syk (0.5 μg) at 30 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, and 20 μm unlabeled ATP for 30 min. Phosphorylated forms were separated from unphosphorylated proteins, p38syk, ATP, and the other reagents by glutathione-Sepharose column (300 μl) coupled to recombinant GST fused with the c-Fgr SH2 domain. The phosphorylated proteins, bound to the column, were eluted with 20 mmphosphotyrosine and detected by immunostaining with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Phosphorylation of the recombinant forms of HS1 was performed at 30 °C in 30 μl of incubation mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 20 μm [γ32P]ATP (specific radioactivity, 1000–2000 cpm/pmol), and the indicated amount of recombinant protein and tyrosine kinase. The reactions were stopped at the indicated time by addition of 2% SDS, and the samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The degree of protein phosphorylation was evaluated either by analysis on a Packard Instant Imager or by autoradiography and counting of the identified radiolabeled bands. Peptide NEMEAPTTAYKKTTP was phosphorylated in the above-described basal buffer supplemented with the indicated amount of enzyme. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1 ml of 1 N HCl and processed as described elsewhere (18Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. Ruzzene M. Marin O. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters were measured by 3-min incubation in the presence of 13 and 18 nm c-Fgr and Lyn, respectively.K m and Vmax values were determined by double reciprocal plots, constructed from initial rate measurements fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. HS1 (0.4 μg) sequentially phosphorylated by Syk in the presence of unlabeled ATP and then by c-Fgr in the presence of [γ32P]ATP, as described previously, was submitted to SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose filter, and phosphorylated HS1 was localized by autoradiography.32P-Labeled HS1 was excised and tryptically digested. The resulting peptides were separated by two-dimensional thin layer cellulose electrophoresis at pH 8.9, followed by ascending chromatography as described previously (19Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 111-149Google Scholar). The Superdex 200 column mounted on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast performance liquid chromatography system was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The first 25 ml were collected altogether, and then fractions of 0.2 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time of flight mass spectra were accumulated using Voyager Elite (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). α-Cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (5 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile and 50% 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) was used as the matrix. Samples were analyzed in pulsed extraction reflection mode using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV, a pulse delay time of 75 ns, a grid voltage of 55%, and a guide wire voltage of 0.05%. HS1 (5 μg) was phosphorylated first by Syk and unlabeled ATP and then by c-Fgr and [γ32P]ATP as described above. A partial tryptic digest of 32P-labeled HS1 was passed over an immobilized metal ion affinity column (iminodiacetic acid from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed, and the radioactive peak eluted using 10% acetic acid was analyzed by negative ion parent mode scanning mass spectometry. The mass spectrometer was set to scan for parent ions producing a signal at −79 m/z. The molecular mass of HS1 predicted from its amino acid composition is 53,913. Nevertheless, HS1 has been repeatedly described as a 75–80-kDa protein based on its migration in SDS-PAGE (1Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Miyagoe Y. Ariyasu T. Watanabe T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9367-9379PubMed Google Scholar). The possibility that this discrepancy could be attributable to post-translational addition of bulky groups, e.g. glycosylation, has been suggested (1Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Miyagoe Y. Ariyasu T. Watanabe T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9367-9379PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant HS1 expressed in Escherichia coli with a His tag, however, exhibits an abnormally high Mr on SDS-PAGE, and even its truncated forms, lacking N-terminal and/or C-terminal regions, run much slower than expected (see Fig. 2A). To check whether this might be attributable to modifications,e.g. ubiquitination or glycosylation, the actual molecular mass of HS1(Δ402–486) with an apparent Mr of 68,000 on SDS-PAGE was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (Fig. 2B), giving a mass (m/z) of 49,395, which almost perfectly matches the theoretical value based on amino acid composition. It has to be assumed therefore that the abnormally high apparentMr calculated on SDS-PAGE reflects molecular features that give rise to irregular migration in the gel. The elution volumes of either full-length HS1 or its truncated forms on Superdex 200 gel filtration at pH 7.5 and in the presence of 0.15 mm NaCl are smaller than expected, consistent withMr values even larger than those calculated by SDS-PAGE. The structural features reflecting the slow migration on SDS-PAGE and fast elution from Superdex 200 reside in the proline-rich central region of the molecule, because they are still evident with doubly truncated HS1. This would also rule out any dimerization mediated by the interactions of the SH3 and proline-rich domains of two distinct HS1 molecules. As shown in Fig. 3, neither HS1 (as previously shown; Ref. 11Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) nor its truncated forms are appreciably phosphorylated either by c-Fgr or by Lyn (data not shown). All of them, however, can be readily phosphorylated by Syk and subsequently become good substrates for c-Fgr and Lyn. This shows that the whole process of sequential phosphorylation, consisting of primary phosphorylation by Syk, which triggers subsequent secondary phosphorylation by Src kinases (10Brunati A.M. Ruzzene M. James P. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), does not require structural elements outside the central core of the molecule (residues 208–401), which includes the proline-rich region and the two main primary phosphorylation sites. It should be noted that the N-terminal deletion (1–207) removes 10 of the 17 tyrosines of HS1 (which are mostly concentrated in the repeat region), whereas 3 additional tyrosines are lost as a consequence of the C-terminal deletion (402–486). It is remarkable therefore that the remnant of the molecule with just 4 tyrosines left undergoes multiple sequential tyrosyl residue phosphorylation as efficiently as the full-length protein. At least two of the tyrosyl residues left (Tyr-378 and Tyr-397) and probably also a third one (Tyr-360) are susceptible to primary phosphorylation by Syk (10Brunati A.M. Ruzzene M. James P. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It was very likely therefore that the secondary site, affected by c-Fgr, at least in the doubly truncated form of HS1, should have been the only tyrosine left, Tyr-222. Tryptic digestion and 2D TLC mapping of full-length HS1 phosphoradiolabeled by either c-Fgr (see Fig. 4) or Lyn (data not shown) after primary phosphorylation with cold ATP showed the presence of a single radioactive spot. This pattern was not altered by prolonged incubation with c-Fgr, consistent with the concept that an individual site was affected. This site was analyzed by mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After tryptic digestion of 32P-labeled HS1, four large radioactive peptides were identified: 4672 m/z (residues 208–250), 4689 m/z (residues 184–224), 4560 m/z(residues 184–223), and 2520 m/z (residues 184–204). Because a complete tryptic digest of the same preparation showed that only one site is phosphorylated, this site must be the tyrosine 222, because this is the only one common to all the four peptides. It can be concluded therefore that Tyr-222 is the main if not the only target of secondary phosphorylation of phospho-HS1 by c-Fgr either in the full-length or in the truncated protein. The implication of SH2 domains of Src tyrosine kinases in the secondary phosphorylation of primarily phosphorylated HS1 was first suggested by the striking similarity between the consensus sequences recognized by Syk (i.e. the agent of primary phosphorylation; Ref. 18Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. Ruzzene M. Marin O. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and, once phosphorylated, by the SH2 domains of Src kinases (12Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Later it was corroborated by competition experiments, which showed that phosphopeptides can prevent the secondary phosphorylation of phospho-HS1 with an efficiency that correlates to their affinity for the SH2 domains of Src kinases (11Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This concept has been now further validated by using recombinant SH2 domain of c-Fgr as potential antagonist of secondary phosphorylation of phospho-HS1 (and its truncated derivatives) by c-Fgr. As shown in Fig. 5, the phosphoradiolabeling of HS1 (previously phosphorylated by Syk with unlabeled ATP) is abolished either by adding a phosphopeptide reproducing the main site of primary phosphorylation, in agreement with previous data (11Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), or by adding the recombinant GST-SH2 fusion protein in the medium in which secondary phosphorylation was performed. Similar results were obtained using truncated forms of HS1 instead of the full-length protein (data not shown). The hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of the SH2 domain was attributable to its association with phospho-HS1, thus preventing the binding of c-Fgr, was confirmed by documenting the formation of complexes between phospho-HS1 and GST-SH2 fusion protein. This was done by two procedures: (i) gel filtration on Superdex 200, in which GST-SH2 preincubated with phospho-HS1 was eluted earlier than GST-SH2 alone (Fig. 6C); and (ii) binding of phospho-HS1 (but not HS1) to GST-SH2-glutathione-Sepharose and its elution with excess phosphotyrosine (Fig. 7). The latter procedure also allowed the recovery of phospho-HS1, either full-length or truncated forms, for kinetic analyses (see below).Figure 7Separation of unphosphorylated and p38syk-phosphorylated HS1 by GST-SH2-glutathione-Sepharose. Recombinant HS1 (20 μg) was phosphorylated by p38syk and separated from the unphosphorylated form by GST-SH2-glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 30-μl aliquots of the fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie Blue. Protein amount was quantified by transmittance densitometry with an Image Master VDS (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Inset, immunostaining with anti-phosphotyrosine of 10-μl aliquots of the indicated fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The gel filtration approach was also used to monitor the formation of complexes between phospho-HS1 and the whole c-Fgr kinase (rather than its SH2 domain alone). As shown in Fig. 6D, c-Fgr alone peaks around fraction 26. Preincubation with phospho-HS1 plus [γ32P]ATP and Mg2+ does not significantly change the elution volume of c-Fgr, which is resolved from phosphoradiolabeled HS1 (Fig. 6H), consistent with the concept that after the sequential phosphorylation is completed, HS1 and c-Fgr dissociate from each other. Surprisingly, no association between phospho-HS1 and c-Fgr could be detected even in the absence of ATP (and after addition of EDTA) to prevent the occurrence of secondary phosphorylation (Fig. 6E). It should be concluded therefore that unlike GST-SH2, the SH2 domain incorporated into c-Fgr is unable to bind phospho-HS1. If, however, c-Fgr is preincubated alone with ATP and Mg2+ and subsequently added to phospho-HS1 in the presence of EDTA (to prevent secondary phosphorylation of HS1), it coelutes, together with HS1, earlier than c-Fgr alone (Fig. 6G), revealing that the expected c-Fgr-phospho-HS1 complex has been formed. These data show that the formation of a stable complex between HS1 and c-Fgr requires not only primary phosphorylation of HS1 at its SH2 binding sites but also autophosphorylation of c-Fgr. The complex between phospho-HS1 and autophosphorylated c-Fgr (through its SH2 domain), moreover, readily dissociates with completion of secondary phosphorylation of HS1 (Fig. 6H). The use of GST-SH2-glutathione-Sepharose (see Fig. 7) made it possible to recover sufficient amounts of phospho-HS1 derivatives free of nonphosphorylated HS1 to be used as substrate in kinetic experiments with Src kinases. As shown in Table I, full-length phospho-HS1 displays quite a low K m value, ∼150 nm, using either c-Fgr or Lyn as secondary phosphorylating agent, consistent with the physiological occurrence of this process (7Yamanashi Y. Fukuda T. Nishizumi H. Inazu T. Higashi K. Kitamura D. Ishida T. Yamamura H. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The truncated forms of phospho-HS1 display similar phosphorylation efficiencies, corroborating the concept that the N-terminal HS1-associated protein X-1 binding and repeat domains and the C-terminal SH3 domain are not required for optimal sequential phosphorylation of HS1.Table IKinetic constants of phospho-HS1 and its truncated forms for c-Fgr and Lyn protein tyrosine kinasesSubstrateKinasec-FgrLynKcatK mEfficiencyKcatK mEfficiencymin−1μmK cat × K m−1min−1μmKcat × Km−1Phospho-HS12.70.1320.72.250.1515Phospho-HS1 (Δ1–207)2.50.1714.71.950.1811Phospho-HS1 (Δ402–486)3.60.2514.42.400.2410Phospho-HS1 (Δ1–207/402–486)4.20.0946.62.100.1021NEMEAPTTAYKKTTP0.137.5 × 10317 × 10−60.178.2 × 10320 × 10−6HS1 and its deleted mutants were phosphorylated by incubation with p38syk at their primary sites and purified by GST-SH2 glutathione sepharose affinity chromatography (see Fig. 7) before use for kinetic experiments.

Other experimental details are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The high affinity of phospho-HS1 for Src kinases is likely to reflect its binding to the SH2 domain of the kinase rather than purely catalytic interactions. The sequence of the phosphoacceptor site (Tyr-222) is in fact markedly divergent from the optimal sequences selected by c-Fgr and Lyn in an oriented peptide library (20Ruzzene M. Songyang Z. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Brunati A.M. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and it lacks, in particular, the crucial hydrophobic residue at position n-1, which is important for site recognition by all Src kinases (20Ruzzene M. Songyang Z. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Brunati A.M. Guerra B. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Indeed unphosphorylated HS1 and its truncated forms are not appreciably phosphorylated by c-Fgr (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4). Moreover, a peptide reproducing the Tyr-222 site resulted in a negligible substrate for both c-Fgr and Lyn, displaying K m values of ∼8 mm (Table I). The hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein HS1 has been shown to be implicated in receptor-mediated apoptotic and proliferative responses (6Fukuda T. Kitamura D. Taniuchi I. Maekawa Y. Benhamou L.E. Sarthou P. Watanabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7302-7306Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Yamanashi Y. Fukuda T. Nishizumi H. Inazu T. Higashi K. Kitamura D. Ishida T. Yamamura H. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After stimulation of B lymphocytes by the antigen receptors, HS1 becomes rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosyl residues in parallel with the activation of Src family kinases (8Yamanashi Y. Okada M. Semba T. Yamori T. Umemori H. Tsunasawa S. Toyoshima K. Kitamura D. Watanabe T . Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3631-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In vitro studies, however, showed that HS1 as such is not a good target for Src kinases unless it is previously phosphorylated by the Src unrelated protein-tyrosine kinase p72syk or its truncated catalytic domain, p38syk, at sites that bind the SH2 domain of the Src kinases (11Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This kind of sequential mode of phosphorylation appears to operate also in vivo, because a synergism between Syk and Src-related Lyn protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of HS1 has been reported in hematopoietic cells lines, in which it is required for both nuclear translocation of HS1 and B cell apoptosis (7Yamanashi Y. Fukuda T. Nishizumi H. Inazu T. Higashi K. Kitamura D. Ishida T. Yamamura H. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is important therefore to unravel the structural features underlying the sequential phosphorylation of HS1. Initial experiments have shown that the abnormally high apparent Mr observed with SDS-PAGE (75 instead of 54 kDa according to amino acid composition) of HS1 as well as of its N- and C-terminally truncated derivatives is not attributable to post-translational addition of bulky components,e.g. glycosylation or ubiquitinylation. Mass spectrometry measurements are consistent with the theoretical molecular mass, suggesting that abnormally high Mr on SDS-PAGE reflects the properties of a very asymmetrical and extended molecule. The observation that abnormal Mr is also displayed by the doubly truncated form of HS1, HS1Δ1–207/402–486, supports the view that rod-like shape and rigidity are features of its central region, mostly consisting of a proline-rich domain. Interestingly, such a truncated core of HS1, encompassing residues 208–401 and lacking the whole N-terminal putative helix-turn-helix repeat region and the C-terminal SH3 domain, is still able to undergo all the steps of sequential phosphorylation as efficiently as full-length HS1. Primary phosphorylation sites affected by Syk are located at the end of this core (Tyr-378 and Tyr-397), whereas the site of secondary phosphorylation is close to the N-terminal end of the core (Tyr-222). This site is not affected at all by Syk, and its phosphorylation by c-Fgr and other Src family kinases is absolutely dependent on the previous phosphorylation of the primary sites. Phospho-HS1 (and its truncated forms) are outstanding substrates for Src kinases, with K m values in the nanomolar range. In contrast, unphosphorylated HS1 and its truncated derivatives and a pentadecapeptide reproducing the phosphoacceptor site (Tyr-222) are not phosphorylated to any appreciable extent. Clearly, therefore, high efficiency Tyr-222 phosphorylation is not dictated by local specificity determinants but by conformational features. These rely primarily on the interaction between phospho-HS1 and the SH2 domain of c-Fgr, because the addition of either HS1 phosphopeptide or the SH2 domain of c-Fgr prevents the phosphorylation of Tyr-222. The formation of stable complexes between HS1 and c-Fgr requires three conditions to be fulfilled: (i) priming phosphorylation of HS1 by Syk to generate the docking sites for the SH2 domain of c-Fgr, (ii) autophosphorylation of c-Fgr, and (iii) lack of phosphate in the secondary site of HS1 (Tyr-222). Although the structural basis of the first feature is in some way self-evident, because it is well established that SH2 domains bind tyrosine only in its phosphorylated form (22Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), the other two points deserve some comments. The ability of phospho-HS1 to form stable complexes with the SH2 domain of c-Fgr is proven unambiguously by the experiments with recombinant SH2 (see Fig. 6C); therefore, the failure of phospho-HS1 to bind full-length native c-Fgr came as a surprise. This would imply that either the SH2 domain of c-Fgr is already occupied by phosphotyrosine, notably the C-terminal one (Tyr-511) known to down-regulate Src kinases by intramolecular interaction with SH2 domain (23Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 24Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar), or it has a conformation that makes it inaccessible to phospho-HS1. The first possibility was ruled out by the absence of phosphotyrosine in the c-Fgr preparations used in our experiments, as judged by failure to immunoreact with anti-phosphotyrosine serum (data not shown). It has to be assumed therefore that the overall conformation of c-Fgr makes its SH2 domain inaccessible to phosphotyrosyl residues of other proteins. Apparently such a structural hindrance is overcome by autophosphorylation of c-Fgr: after preincubation with ATP and Mg2+, in fact, the complex with phospho-HS1 is readily formed. That this is caused by autophosphorylation is confirmed by effect of EDTA, which prevents both autophosphorylation and association with phospho-HS1 of c-Fgr preincubated with ATP and Mg2+(see Fig. 6G). It has to be concluded therefore that autophosphorylation (occurring at Tyr-400) has conformational consequences resulting in a better exposure of the SH2 domain. The observation that once Tyr-222 is phosphorylated the HS1-Fgr complex dissociated would be a trivial one if this were just a regular enzyme-substrate interaction, in which the final product is obviously released from the enzyme. In our case, however, the main interaction does not occur at the catalytic site but far away, because it involves the SH2 domain of the kinase and the primary phosphorylation site(s) of HS1 (Tyr-378 and Tyr-397). It has to be assumed therefore that this interaction is weakened by phosphorylation of Tyr-222, through an allosteric mechanism that ultimately causes the detachment of fully phosphorylated HS1 from c-Fgr. This is a nice example of a mechanism by which TyrP-SH2 interactions can be overcome without the intervention of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine. In summary, as shown schematically in Fig. 8, the sequential phosphorylation of HS1 is under the concerted control of a variety of factors impinging on both the substrate and the kinases. First p72syk must be activated. Although the precise regulation of p72syk is still unclear, it is known that it becomes active early after B cell stimulation through mechanisms that imply the interaction of its two SH2 domains with the so-called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif phosphorylated motifs of membrane proteins (25Shiue L. Zoller M.J. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10498-10502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26Rowley R.B. Burkhardt A.L. Chao H.-G. Matsueda G.R. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11590-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and/or direct phosphorylation of p72syk itself (27Chu D.H. Spits H. Peyron J.F. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6251-6261Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Williams S. Couture C. Gilman J. Jascur T. Deckert M. Altman A. Mustelin T. Eur. J.

Active Syk initiates HS1 phosphorylation by acting on its primary sites (notably Tyr-378 and Tyr-397). Most likely this primary phosphorylation takes place by simple recognition of consensus sequences specified by several acidic residues surrounding the tyrosyl residues. This point of view is supported by the observation that short peptides reproducing the Tyr-397 site are readily phosphorylated by either p72syk and p38syk (lacking both the SH2 domains) with very favorable kinetic constants (18Brunati A.M. Donella-Deana A. Ruzzene M. Marin O. Pinna L.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting they include most of the structural elements required for binding to the kinase. Primary phosphorylation of HS1 generates the SH2 binding motif(s) that are a prerequisite for the third step, i.e. recruitment of phospho-HS1 by an Src kinase. Interestingly, however, as discussed above, this step also requires, at least in the case of c-Fgr, previous autophosphorylation of the Src kinase, which in its unphosphorylated form is unable to bind phospho-HS1. This binding, as demonstrated here and in previous work (11Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Marin O. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5327-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), is a necessary condition for the fourth step (secondary phosphorylation) to take place: accordingly a synthetic peptide reproducing the sequence around Tyr-222 but obviously lacking the SH2 domain is not appreciably phosphorylated by c-Fgr (or by another Src kinase, Lyn), displaying a K m value of 7.5 mm. A minimum core region of HS1 spanning between the SH2 domain anchoring sites (Tyr-397 and Tyr-378) and the secondary phosphorylation site (Tyr-222) and including the whole “proline-rich domain” (with its C-terminal tail also termed the “proline-glutamate repeats”; Ref.1Kitamura D. Kaneko H. Miyagoe Y. Ariyasu T. Watanabe T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9367-9379PubMed Google Scholar) and the putative nuclear localization sequence represents a necessary and also a sufficient condition for the process of sequential phosphorylation to occur. This core is also responsible for the abnormally high apparent Mr of HS1 on SDS-PAGE and, even more, on gel filtration, suggesting that the proline-rich region has an asymmetric, rod-shaped conformation. Murine LckBP1 protein has been suggested to be the murine counterpart of human HS1 (30Takemoto Y. Furuta M. Li X.-K. Strong-Sparks W.-J. Hascimoto Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3403-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the tyrosyl residues implicated in sequential phosphorylation of HS1 are also conserved in LckBP1, corroborating the notion that ability to undergo sequential phosphorylation represents a crucial feature of this class of hematopoietic proteins. In contrast, this may be not the case of cortactins, another class of proteins sharing a number of features with HS1 and LckBP1, in which the proline-rich domain is shorter and the tyrosyl residues implicated in sequential phosphorylation are not conserved (30Takemoto Y. Furuta M. Li X.-K. Strong-Sparks W.-J. Hascimoto Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3403-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although the proline-rich region of LckBP1 has been shown to bind the SH3 domain of Lck kinase (30Takemoto Y. Furuta M. Li X.-K. Strong-Sparks W.-J. Hascimoto Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3403-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), our data would rule out that such an interaction might play a crucial role in the phosphorylation of HS1 by c-Fgr or Lyn. First, in fact, we could not detect any phosphorylation-independent association of HS1 with c-Fgr. Second, the prolyl-rich peptide KGGRSLRPLPPLPPPG known to interact with Src SH3 domains (31Weng Z. Thomas S.M. Rickles R.J. Taylor J.A. Brauer A.W. Seidel-Dugan C. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4509-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) failed to affect the phosphorylation of phospho-HS1 at its Tyr-222 site by either c-Fgr (Fig. 5B) or Lyn (data not shown). We are grateful to Dr. T. Watanabe for generously providing the human HS1 cDNA."

This study was designed to determine the nature of specific kinases in lymphocytes that phosphorylate CD45 and to determine the effect of phosphorylation on CD45 PTP activity. A major cytoplasmic lymphocyte kinase that phosphorylated CD45 was identified as casein kinase 2 (CK2) by use of an in-gel kinase assay in combination with immunoprecipitation, immunodepletion, and specific inhibition. Mutational analysis of CK2 consensus sites showed that the target for CK2 was in an acidic insert of 19 amino acids in the D2 domain, and Ser to Ala mutations at amino acids 965, 968, 969, and 973 abrogated CK2 phosphorylation of CD45. CK2 phosphorylation increased CD45 activity 3-fold toward phosphorylated myelin basic protein, and this increase was reversible by PP2A treatment. Mutation of Ser to Glu at the CK2 sites had the same effect as phosphorylation and also tripled the Vmax of CD45. CD45 isolatedin vivo was highly phosphorylated and could not be phosphorylated by CK2 without prior dephosphorylation with phosphatase PP2A. We conclude that CK2 is a major lymphocyte kinase that is responsible for in vivo phosphorylation of CD45, and phosphorylation at specific CK2 sites regulates CD45 PTP activity.

Mutational analysis of CK2 consensus sites showed that the target for CK2 was in an acidic insert of 19 amino acids in the D2 domain, and Ser to Ala mutations at amino acids 965, 968, 969, and 973 abrogated CK2 phosphorylation of CD45. CK2 phosphorylation increased CD45 activity 3-fold toward phosphorylated myelin basic protein, and this increase was reversible by PP2A treatment. Mutation of Ser to Glu at the CK2 sites had the same effect as phosphorylation and also tripled the Vmax of CD45. CD45 isolatedin vivo was highly phosphorylated and could not be phosphorylated by CK2 without prior dephosphorylation with phosphatase PP2A. We conclude that CK2 is a major lymphocyte kinase that is responsible for in vivo phosphorylation of CD45, and phosphorylation at specific CK2 sites regulates CD45 PTP activity.

CD45 is a transmembrane PTP of hematopoietic cells composed of 1268 total amino acids with an external domain containing alternately used exons, which leads to the lymphocyte-specific expression of at least eight different isoforms (1Ulyanova T.

The cytoplasmic domain consists of 702 amino acids and contains two tandem repeated PTP domains designated D1 and D2 (1Ulyanova T. Blasioli J. Thomas M.L. Immunol. Res. 1997; 16: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The membrane-proximal PTP domain (D1) is constitutively active, and the second PTP domain (D2) is considered to be inactive (7Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of the D1 but not the D2 domain is required for TCR signal transduction in CD45-deficient cell lines (8Desai D.M. Sap J. Silvennoinen O. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The role of CD45 in the antigen-specific activation of B and T cells has been documented by demonstrating that T cells and B cells lacking CD45 fail to respond to antigen stimulation (9Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 10Pingel J.T. Thomas M.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 1055-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This observation has been confirmed in CD45 knockout mice in which the antigen signaling capacity of T and B cells was severely diminished and the transition of thymocytes to maturity was impaired (11Byth K.F.

CD45 is believed to activate the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases by dephosphorylating the regulatory Tyr(P) near the C terminus of T cell receptor or B cell receptor-associated Src family kinases (13Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 14Hurley T.R. Hyman R.

However, recently it has become clear that the regulation of Src family kinases is likely to be more complex since the discovery that the activating tyrosine phosphorylation site in the kinase domain is also dephosphorylated by CD45 (17D'Oro U. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4996-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The importance of the CD45 PTP activity in the activation of T cells has been demonstrated by showing that chimeric proteins containing only the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 were capable of restoring normal T cell receptor activation (18Hovis R.R.

Science. 1993; 260: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Despite previous research there is still much to be learned about the range of natural substrates of CD45 as well as about the nature of other proteins that may interact with CD45. Phosphorylation of CD45 may play an essential role in the function of CD45 and may regulate PTP activity, substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and/or docking with other signaling molecules. Decreased PTP activity of CD45 was found to correlate with decreased serine phosphorylation after calcium ionophore treatment of T cells (21Ostergaard H.L. Trowbridge I.S. Science. 1991; 253: 1423-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and serine residues on CD45 have been shown to be phosphorylated in response to T cell treatment with phorbol esters (22Autero M. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1987; 17: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and after IL-2 treatment of CTLL-2.4 cells (23Valentine M.A. Widmer M.B. Ledbetter J.A. Pinault F. Voice R. Clark E.A. Gallis B. Brautigan D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Little or no modulation in CD45 PTP activity was observed after phosphorylation in these reports. In other studies, serine phosphorylation was observed after lectin treatment of T cells, and tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 has been reported in phenylarsine oxide-treated T cells (24Autero M. Saharinen J. Pessa-Morikawa T. Soula-Rothhut M. Oetken C. Gassmann M. Bergman M. Alitalo K. Burn P. Gahmberg C.G. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1308-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Stover D.R. Walsh K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5523-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). CD45 was phosphorylated after in vitro treatment with casein kinase 2 (CK2) and other serine/threonine kinases such as protein kinase C and glycogen synthase kinase (26Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10674-10680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased CD45 PTP activity was found after phosphorylation with p50csk tyrosine kinase (24Autero M. Saharinen J. Pessa-Morikawa T. Soula-Rothhut M. Oetken C. Gassmann M. Bergman M. Alitalo K. Burn P. Gahmberg C.G. Mustelin T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1308-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and after sequential tyrosine phosphorylation by v-Abl kinase (using ATPγS) followed by serine phosphorylation with CK2 (25Stover D.R. Walsh K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5523-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Using two-dimensional TLC, HPLC, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), we have identified several in vivo phosphorylation sites of CD45 (27Kang S. Liao P. Gage D.A. Esselman W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11588-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One phosphorylation site identified in that study, Ser939, is in a putative substrate-binding loop of the inactive D2 PTP domain. Three other sites, Ser1204, Thr1246, and Ser1248 are in the C-terminal tail of the molecule. Another multiply phosphorylated region was tentatively localized to the 19-amino acid acidic insert in the D2 domain (27Kang S. Liao P. Gage D.A. Esselman W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11588-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The importance of CD45 phosphorylation sites to PTP activity or to T cell activation remains unknown. The present study was designed to evaluate the relationship of precise CD45 phosphorylation events to the functional role of CD45. In this study, we have identified CK2 as a lymphocyte kinase that targets CD45 and that is responsible for phosphorylation of CD45 in the 19-amino acid acidic region of the D2 domain of CD45. This region is a unique insert in the D2 domain that is not found in the CD45 D1 domain or in any other PTP D1 or D2 domain. Investigation of the relationship of the CK2 phosphorylation sites to the PTP activity of CD45 showed that phosphorylation of the D2 acidic region by CK2 increased CD45 activity 3-fold toward phosphorylated myelin basic protein. CTLL-2 (murine cytolytic T cell line), DO-11.10 (murine T cell hybridoma) and 70Z/3.12 (murine pre-B lymphocyte cell line) were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Jurkat (clone E6–1) (human acute T cell leukemia cell line), and CD45-deficient Jurkat clone (J45.01) were obtained from Dr. Gary Koretzky (University of Iowa). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), streptomycin/penicillin (100 units/ml; Life Technologies), and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Recombinant IL-2 (Cetus Corp.) was added to the CTLL-2 cultures at 7 units/ml. BW5147 (murine T lymphoma), WEHI274.1 (murine monocyte), P815 (murine mastocytoma), and NIH3T3 (murine fibroblast) were obtained from ATCC and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, streptomycin/penicillin (100 units/ml), and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were maintained in an exponential growth state (0.1–5.0 × 105 cells/ml), and cultures with viability greater than 97% were harvested for experimental use. The bacterial expression vector pET3d-His6CD45, which expresses the cytoplasmic domain of murine CD45 with a His6 tag introduced to the amino terminus, was kindly provided by Dr. Pauline Johnson (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) (28Ng D.H. Maiti A. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Multiple point mutations in the acidic insert of the D2 domain of CD45 were made using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Desired mutations (underlined) were incorporated into a pair of oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the parental DNA template. The primers used for Ser to Ala (965, 968, 969, and 973) mutagenesis were as follows: 5′-GTGAGCCTGAAGCAGATGAGGCTGCAGATGATGACGCTGACTCAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTGAGTCAGCGTCATCATCTGCAGCCTCATCTGCTTCAGGCTCAC-3′. The primers used for Ser to Glu (965, 968, 969, and 973) mutagenesis were 5′-GTGAGCCTGAAGAAGATGAGGAGGAAGATGATGACGAGGACTCAGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCTGAGTCCTCGTCATCATCTTCCTCCTCATCTTCTTCAGGCTCAC-3′. The primers were extended by Pfu DNA polymerase during a short temperature cycling (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 13.5 min (2 min/kb of plasmid length), 18 cycles), and the parental DNA template was then digested by DpnI endonuclease. Mutants were selected after the synthesized DNA was transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue and later verified by sequencing. Recombinant wild type and mutant cytoplasmic domain CD45 (designated His6-cytCD45) was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) as described (28Ng D.H. Maiti A. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The size of the purified proteins was determined on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The in-gel kinase assay was adapted from a previously described method (29Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10% polyacrylamide gel was cross-linked with 50 μg/ml of His6-cytCD45 substrate, while the stacking gel was prepared without the substrate. Cell lysates (1 × 106 cells) or immunoprecipitates were loaded onto the gel for electrophoresis. The gel was washed thoroughly with 20% 2-propanol to remove SDS, and the protein kinases in the gel were then denatured with two incubations with 6 m guanidine HCl (Life Technologies) and renatured with five changes of 0.04% Tween 40 (Sigma) at 4 °C. The gel was preincubated in the kinase assay buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mmMg(Ac)2, 0.2 mm Ca2+) for 30 min at room temperature. The kinase reaction was started by incubating the gel in the kinase assay buffer containing 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) for 1 h at 30 °C. After the reaction, the gel was washed four to five times with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid solution containing 1% sodium pyrophosphate, until the radioactivity of the solution approached background. The gel was dried on 3MM Whatman paper and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and then lysed in an appropriate volume (5 × 107 cells/ml) of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce), 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.23 units/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml DNase I, 1 μm okadaic acid, 6 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 4 mm sodium molybdate) for 30 min on ice. Cell nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatants were incubated with the antiserum to CK2α, CK2α′, or CK2β kindly provided by Dr. David Litchfield (University of Western Ontario, London, Canada) (30Gietz R.D. Graham K.C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13017-13021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or with antibodies to CD45 (clone 9.4; ATCC) for 2 h. GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, followed by rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. Immune complexes were washed sequentially with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 0.5 m LiCl (pH 7.4), and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4). Immunoblotting was performed on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with a mixture of anti-CK2α and CK2α′ (1:1000 dilution) (30Gietz R.D. Graham K.C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13017-13021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) and visualization with chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PTP activity of CD45 was determined as described previously (31Melkerson-Watson L.J. Waldmann M.E. Gunter A.D. Zaroukian M.H. Esselman W.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2004-2013PubMed Google Scholar) using 32P-labeled myelin basic protein (MBP) and Raytide as substrates. Briefly, 50 μg of Enhanced Raytide (Calbiochem) or 250 μg of MBP (Sigma) was labeled with 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP by incubation with 500 ng of recombinant Src tyrosine kinase (obtained from Dr. J. Dixon, University of Michigan) for 1 h at 30 °C in 160 μl of reaction mixture containing 500 μm ATP, 10 mmMgCl2, 16 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.03 mmEDTA, 0.07% β-mercaptoethanol. Labeled 32P-Raytide or MBP was added to 100 μl of 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 70 μl of 50% cold trichloroacetic acid followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. The pellet was then washed twice with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 200 μl of 200 mmTris, pH 8.0. PTP assays were carried out at 30 °C, and each assay contained 5 μl of 10× PTP buffer (250 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 50 mm EDTA, 100 mm DTT), 35 μl of H2O, 5 μl of 32P-labeled MBP, and 5 μl of sample to be assayed. After incubation for various times, aliquots of the reaction mixture were taken out and added to 0.75 ml of acidic charcoal suspension (0.9 m HCl, 90 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNaH2PO4, and 4% (w/v) active charcoal (Sigma)) to stop the reaction. After centrifugation, the amount of released32P in the supernatant was measured in a scintillation counter. For the His6-cytCD45 kinetics, specific activity is expressed as nmol/min/mg of protein and was plotted against substrate concentration. Kinetic parameters were calculated by nonlinear curve fitting of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Microcal Origin software (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). The kinetics parameters of CK2 (Boehringer Mannheim) with His6-cytCD45 as substrate were determined with a CK2 assay using Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper squares as described previously (26Tonks N.K. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10674-10680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant His6-cytCD45 protein (1 μg) was either mock-treated or treated with 0.04 milliunits of recombinant CK2 (Boehringer Mannheim) at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 5 μm ATP. PP2A treatment was performed as follows. His6-cytCD45 was phosphorylated as described above, followed by the addition of sufficient heparin (10 μg/ml) to inhibit CK2 without inhibiting CD45 (determined by titration of heparin with each enzyme). The phosphorylated CD45 was then mock-treated or incubated with PP2A (0.5 units; Promega) for an additional 30 min at 30 °C. The mixture was then subjected to PTP assay as described above. Immunoprecipitated CD45 from Jurkat T cells (1 × 107 cells for each sample) were either mock-treated or treated with PP2A (Promega) for 1 h at 30 °C in 40 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 μl of PP2A (0.5 units/μl). Treated immunoprecipitates were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 0.5 m LiCl (pH 7.4), and 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4). The in vitro kinase labeling by CK2 was performed at 30 °C. Each reaction contained 4 μl of 10× kinase buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT), 20 μl of immunoprecipitated CD45, 1 μl of recombinant CK2 (0.2 milliunits/μl; Boehringer Mannheim), 1 μl of 0.1 mmATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), and H2O to 40 μl. The reaction was incubated for 30 min and then terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer at 100 °C. Labeled CD45 immunoprecipitates were loaded onto 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by electrophoresis and PhosphorImager analysis. FPLC analysis was performed using a Mono-Q anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using buffer systems described previously (28Ng D.H. Maiti A. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and a NaCl gradient from 150 to 600 mm. Eluted proteins were assayed by the release of phosphate using pNPP (Sigma) as substrate. CK2 phosphorylation of His6-cytCD45 for FPLC analysis was performed as described above. CD45 trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry were performed as described previously (27Kang S. Liao P. Gage D.A. Esselman W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11588-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-PAGE-purified, 32P-labeled CD45 was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, excised, and subjected to tryptic digestion with 10 μg of trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides were recovered and subjected to HPLC fractionation using a microbore reverse-phase HPLC system (Michrom BioResources, Inc., CA) (27Kang S. Liao P. Gage D.A. Esselman W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11588-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic, multiply phosphorylated HPLC fraction 4 (27Kang S. Liao P. Gage D.A. Esselman W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11588-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was subjected to MALDI-MS (Voyager Elite time-of-flight; PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) exactly as described previously (27Kang S. Liao P. Gage D.A. Esselman W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11588-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A computer program, MSU MassMap (32Liao P.C. Leykam J. Andrews P.C. Gage D.A. Allison J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), was used to calculate the average masses of all possible peptide and phosphopeptide fragments from CD45. In-gel kinase assays were used in an effort to identify kinases from T cells with potential to phosphorylate CD45. The in-gel kinase assay was performed by separating cytoplasmic lysates of CTLL-2 cells in SDS-PAGE gels containing the His6-tagged recombinant cytoplasmic domain of CD45 (His6-cytCD45) at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. The gel containing separated proteins was renatured, and [γ-32P]ATP was added to detect kinase activity (Fig. 1). Without in-gel substrate, several radioactive bands between 40 and 120 kDa were present and most likely represent the autophosphorylation of some CTLL-2 kinases. With CD45 in-gel substrate, the electrophoretically separated CTLL-2 lysates exhibited enhanced labeling of two major bands at 40 and 45 kDa (arrows) (Fig. 1A, lane 2), which indicated phosphorylation of CD45 by a kinase doublet. Digestion and phosphoamino acid analysis of both phosphorylated bands showed that the proteins were exclusively phosphorylated on serine residues (not shown). The enhanced labeling at 40 and 45 kDa was selective for CD45 because the incorporation into other substrates such as MBP at 50 μg/ml or even at 500 μg/ml only resulted in a basal level of phosphorylation at the same position (Fig. 1A,lanes 3 and 4). The CD45 in-gel kinase activity was found to be broadly distributed among a panel of murine cell lines, including T cell lines (CTLL-2, DO-11.10, BW5147), a B cell line (70Z/3.12), myeloid cells (WEHI274.1, P815), a fibroblast line (NIH3T3), and a human T cell line (Jurkat) (Fig. 2A). Each cell type exhibited two bands resulting from a CD45-selective kinase at 40 and 45 kDa. This indicated that the CD45 kinase was ubiquitously expressed in cell lines derived from various tissues. Candidate serine/threonine kinases in this molecular weight range included MAP kinase and CK2. Examination of the CD45 cytoplasmic domain sequence showed that CD45 had several consensus sites for CK2 phosphorylation, while there were few conserved serine or threonine residues that could serve as MAP kinase substrates. Immunoblotting with a mixture of anti-CK2α and anti-CK2α′ showed that CK2 was widely expressed in these cell types and precisely overlapped with the in-gel kinase activity (Fig. 2B). We then addressed the question of the identity of the CD45 kinase by use of CK2-specific inhibitors. In-gel kinase assays were performed with 50 μg/ml His6-cytCD45 in the presence of known CK2 inhibitors (33Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 34Tawfic S. Olson M.O.J. Ahmed K. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1993; 128: 187-199Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar) to determine whether the observed CD45 in-gel kinase activity was consistent with that of CK2 (Fig. 3). The presence of CD45 in-gel kinase activity was almost completely blocked by treatment with either 50 μg/ml heparin (Fig. 3,lane 3), 200 μm GTP (lane 4), or 2 mg/ml poly-GluTyr (4:1) (lane 5). The activity of authentic recombinant CK2α was also almost completely abrogated by the inhibitors (Fig. 3,lanes 7–9). Taken together, the size of the in-gel kinase coupled with observed inhibition by specific CK2 inhibitors strongly suggested that the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of CD45 in this assay was CK2. To confirm the nature of the CD45 kinase, CK2 immunoprecipitates from cell lysates were subjected to in-gel kinase assays with His6-cytCD45 as substrate (Fig. 4A). CK2 consists of homotetrameric and heterotetrameric complexes (α2β2, α′2β2, and αα′β2) containing two catalytically active α-chains (45-kDa α-chains and 40-kDa α′-chains) and two noncatalytic, regulatory β-chains (26 kDa each) (30Gietz R.D. Graham K.C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13017-13021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In-gel kinase analysis of anti-CK2α immunoprecipitates resulted in prominent labeling of CD45 substrate at 45 kDa (Fig. 4A,lane 1). Analysis of CK2α′ immunoprecipitates resulted in prominent labeling at 40 kDa (Fig. 4A,lane 2), and analysis of CK2β immunoprecipitates resulted in the visualization of radioactive bands consistent in size with CK2α and CK2α′ (Fig. 4A,lane 3). Both α and α′ are expected to exist in CK2α, α′, or β immunoprecipitates due to the existence of heterotetramers as noted above. Precipitation with Sepharose G beads alone did not result in the isolation of in-gel kinases (Fig. 4A, lane 4). Parallel samples subjected to in-gel analysis without added CD45 protein did not result in significant activity (Fig. 4A, lower part). To further confirm that CK2 was the CD45 kinase in CTLL-2 cells, specific CK2 antisera were used to deplete CK2 from CTLL-2 lysates (Fig. 4B). After only one round of immunoprecipitation, the 40-kDa CD45 in-gel kinase activity was preferentially depleted using anti-CK2α′ (Fig. 4B,lane 3), while the CK2 activity was only slightly depleted with anti-CK2α (Fig. 4B, lane 2) or anti-CK2β (Fig. 4B, lane 4). The relatively prominent labeling of the CK2α′ in-gel kinase band and immunodepletion by anti-CK2α′ serum suggested that CK2α′ was the primary form of CK2 catalytic subunit that phosphorylated CD45 in these cells. In order to further characterize the nature of CK2 phosphorylation of CD45, a kinetic analysis was performed. The K m was 0.51 μm, and the Vmax was 35.5 nmol/min/mg with CD45 as a substrate of CK2. These parameters were comparable with reports of CK2 kinetics with other protein substrates (for example,K m = 1.1 μm and Vmax = 82.5 nmol/min/mg with eIF-2 (36Gonzatti-Haces M.I. Traugh J.A. J.

All three His-tagged mutant Rho proteins exhibited similar K m values for ATP; however, the Vmax values at infinite ATP concentrations were one-fourth to one-third that for the His-tagged wild-type enzyme. BCM inhibition kinetics of poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity for the mutant proteins were non-competitive with respect to ATP (altering catalytic function but not ATP binding) and showed increased K ivalues compared with His-tagged wild-type Rho. M219K and G337S exhibited increased ratios of poly(U)/poly(C)-stimulated ATPase activity and lower apparent K m values for ribo(C)10 in the poly(dC)·ribo(C)10–dependent ATPase assay compared with His-tagged wild-type Rho. The S266A mutation did not show an increased poly(U)/poly(C) ATPase activity ratio and maintained approximately the same K m for ribo(C)10in the poly(dC)·ribo(C)10–dependent ATPase assay. The kinetic studies indicated that M219K and G337S altered the secondary RNA binding domain in Rho whereas the S266A mutation did not. Transcription termination assays for each mutant showed different patterns of Rho-terminated transcripts. Tyrosine substitution of Ser-266 led to BCM sensitivity intimating that an OH (hydroxyl) moiety at this position is needed for BCM (binding) inhibition.

Bicyclomycin (BCM) 1The abbreviations used are: BCM, bicyclomycin; DTT, dithiothreitol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RF DNA, replicative form of M13 DNA is a structurally novel antibiotic biosynthetically derived from leucine and isoleucine (1Miyoshi T.

Durham C.A. Chem. Rev. 1988; 88: 511-540Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and has been introduced under the trade name of Bicozamycin for the treatment of nonspecific diarrhea in humans and bacterial diarrhea in calves and swine. Recently, BCM (Structure 1) was shown to have antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive strainMicrococcus luteus (9Nowatzke W.L. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 742-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In 1993, we demonstrated that BCM targets Rho transcription termination factor, an essential protein inEscherichia coli (10Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). BCM resistance was achieved using UV irradiation to produce cells with Rho mutations. Sequence analysis of 20 mutants showed that a single base change occurred in the rho gene at one of three different locations, M219K, S266A, and G337S (10Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Isolation and assay of a crude preparation of the G337S Rho protein showed that at a constant ATP concentration, the poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity was insensitive to BCM, but the wild-type protein was sensitive (10Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies on the BCM-Rho inhibition process have not identified the BCM-binding site. Transcription termination in E. coli is a regulatory process that controls gene expression (11Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H. Neidhardt F. The Molecular and Cell Biology of E. coli and S. typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 1241-1275Google Scholar, 12von Hippel P.H. Bear D.G. Morgan W.D. McSwiggen J.A. Am. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 389-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Transcription termination proceeds by one of two major mechanisms. In one process, nascent RNA is released at intrinsic termination sites along the E. coligenome. Termination (Rho-independent) generally results after an upstream portion of the DNA–RNA hybrid of the transcription bubble is destabilized by competitive formation of an RNA GC-rich hairpin followed by a poly(rU) sequence that disrupts the transcription process. In the second mechanism, Rho factor terminates transcription. Rho first binds to specific cytidine-rich areas on the newly synthesized RNA (the rut site) and then tracks toward the 3′ end of the RNA where the stalled RNA polymerase rests on the transcription bubble (13Richardson J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1048: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The movement of Rho toward the RNA polymerase is fueled by Rho-dependent ATPase activity (14Platt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In a poorly understood mechanism that may involve Rho helicase activity (15Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell. 1987; 48: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), Rho factor disrupts the polymerase complex and terminates transcription (16Steinmetz E.J. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1401-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Richardson L.V. Richardson J.P. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 3531-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with binding domains for the rut RNA site (the primary RNA binding domain) and ATP (20Martinez A. Burns C.M. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of Rho factor is only partially defined (21Briercheck D.M. Wood T.C. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The primary RNA-binding site is localized in the N terminus of Rho (23Modrak D. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8292-8299Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and this binding can be measured by a filter binding assay using radiolabeled poly(C) (25Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Photochemical irradiation of the overexpressed 1–116-amino acid fragment and ribo(C)10 gave a cross-linked adduct and defined the minimum protein sequence required for RNA binding (23Modrak D. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8292-8299Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison of this fragment identified the RNA recognition motif, GFGF, an RNA binding domain conserved motif, located between residues 61 and 64 (26Brennan C.A. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17296-17305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Martinez A. Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 895-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Subsequent site-directed mutational analysis of the phenylalanine residues led to decreased binding for the RNA trp t′ fragment that contains a Rho-dependent termination site. An NMR structure of the N-terminal 130-amino acid fragment has been recently determined (21Briercheck D.M. Wood T.C. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of this fragment has been solved (22Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The entire Rho protein has resisted crystallization. However, comparison of the amino acid sequences of Rho and F1-ATP synthase, another ATP-binding protein, yielded 21% sequence identity and 43% similarity in a pairwise comparison (28Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), permitting a working model of Rho to be built (29Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 815-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequence of the first 130 amino acid residues did not align well with F1-ATP synthase, they do share a common N-terminal β-barrel, which in Rho is similar to an oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding fold (22Allison T.J. Wood T.C. Briercheck D.M. Rastinejad F. Richardson J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This observation strengthens the use of F1-ATP synthase as a suitable structural model for Rho. The ATP binding/hydrolysis domain in Rho is located after amino acid 167 in the C-terminal half of Rho (24Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Bear D.G. Andrews C.L. Singer J.D. Morgan W.D. Grant R.A. von Hippel P.H. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 18810-18815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is similar in primary structure to F1-ATP synthase. Rho ATPase activity can be monitored by a polyribonucleotide-dependent ATPase assay (14Platt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments showed that poly(C) stimulated the latent ATPase activity of Rho by binding to both a primary RNA-binding site and to a secondary (tracking) RNA site (31Dombroski A.J. LaDine J.R. Cross R.L. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18810-18815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A secondary RNA-binding site was proposed after strongly binding poly(dC) failed to stimulate ATPase activity (32Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5760-5766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Pereira S. Platt T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Adding short oligoribonucleotides (at concentrations that by themselves do not stimulate ATPase activity) in the presence of poly(dC) initiated ATP hydrolysis at rates comparable to those observed with poly(C) alone. This finding indicated that poly(dC) binds to the primary RNA-binding site but not to the secondary site. The secondary RNA-binding site appears distinct from the primary binding domain, and the Rho–RNA interactions are weaker permitting the movement of Rho toward the RNA polymerase (16Steinmetz E.J. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1401-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13947-13955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations on Rho that altered the kinetics of ribo(C)10-stimulated Rho ATPase activity in the presence of poly(dC) suggest that the secondary RNA-binding site was altered (33Pereira S. Platt T. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Tsurushita N. Shigesada K. Imai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The secondary site mutations mapped to the F1-ATP synthase-based model did not provide a well characterized binding domain (29Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 815-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of the BCM–Rho interaction showed that BCM inhibits poly(C)-stimulated ATPase activity by a reversible, noncompetitive pathway with respect to ATP (36Park H. Zhang X. Moon H. Zwiefka A. Cox K. Gaskell S.J. Widger W.R. Kohn H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In an in vitrotranscription termination assay, BCM inhibited production of Rho-dependent transcripts (37Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25369-25374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At BCM concentrations that yielded 50% inhibition, transcripts were observed midway between the Rho-dependent and the read-through transcripts, indicating that BCM interfered with the rate of Rho translocation to the stalled polymerase (37Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25369-25374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We found that BCM exhibited mixed type inhibition kinetics in the poly(dC)·ribo(C)10-stimulated ATPase assay which showed that the antibiotic altered binding of ribo(C)10 to Rho, and the K i for BCM was altered by ribo(C)10. This result suggested that BCM inhibited RNA binding at the secondary site in Rho, leading to the loss of the ATPase activity that is necessary for Rho translocation to the RNA polymerase (18Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Richardson J.P. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1453-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 37Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol.

By comparison, much is known about the structural requirements in BCM for Rho binding. A structure-activity relationship study has determined that the C(1) triol and the [4.2.2]-piperazinedione ring system are necessary for drug binding but the C(5)-C(5a) exomethylene group is not (38Zhang Z.

Recently, an aryl aldehyde derivative of BCM was shown to inhibit Rho transcription termination in a manner similar to BCM and led to permanent inactivation of Rho when NaBH4 was added (43Cho H. Park H. Zhang X. Riba I. Gaskell S.J. Widger W.R. Kohn H. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 5432-5440Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar,44Riba I. Gaskell S.J. Cho H. Widger W.R. Kohn H. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34033-34041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), providing preliminary information on BCM binding. Significantly, Platt and co-workers (31Dombroski A.J. LaDine J.R. Cross R.L. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18810-18815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that Lys-181 is also near the catalytic ATP hydrolysis site. A complementary approach to elucidate the BCM binding pocket in Rho is to analyze the effect of site mutations in Rho that alter drug binding and the kinetic properties of the protein. In this work, the kinetic behavior of three BCM-resistant mutant Rho proteins, M219K, S266A, and G337S, and a site-directed mutant S266Y are characterized. The location of these mutations on a putative model of Rho based on the F1-ATP synthase structure for bovine mitochondrial enzyme is discussed in context of their biochemical behavior. BCM was kindly provided by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), and was further purified by three successive silica gel chromatographies using 20% methanol/chloroform as the eluant (36Park H. Zhang X. Moon H. Zwiefka A. Cox K. Gaskell S.J.

Bacterial phage M13 mp19RF DNA and polynucleotides were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnology, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). E. colistrain SDM, T7 DNA polymerase, and 5-methyl-dCTP were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Co., and T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction enzymes were from Promega Co.

Polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plates used for ATPase assays were purchased from J. T. Baker, Inc. Ribo(C)10 was obtained from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR). All other chemicals were reagent grade. Rho DNA (wild-type) was amplified from the p39-ASE plasmid using PCR technology with Pfupolymerase. Mismatched primers 5′-AGAACTCACACCCATATGAATCTTACCG-3′ and 5′-CAGGAATTTTCCTCATATGCCCAGCGCG-3′ creating unique NdeI sites at the start of translation and downstream from the gene at base position 1327 were used to amplify the rho gene. The resulting DNA was digested with NdeI and ligated into the NdeI-linearized pET-14b expression vector. Transformants introduced into JM107 host cells were identified for proper orientation and sequenced to ensure no unwanted substitutions were introduced from the amplification step. The plasmid pET-RhoW was introduced into BL21(DE3)pLysS, and the expression of Rho protein was induced with addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a cell concentration of 0.8 A at 600 nm. After 4 h incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0 buffer (buffer A). The cells were treated with lysozyme at 0.5 mg/ml for 20 min at 0 °C and then 4 μg/ml DNase I were added. The lysed cells were placed on ice for 10 min after which they were subjected to brief sonic disruption. The broken cells were centrifuged, and the soluble proteins were loaded on a Talon metal affinity resin. The column was washed with buffer A alone, buffer A with 10 mm imidazole, and buffer A with 50 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with buffer A and 200 mm imidazole. Peak fractions were collected and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, 0.1 mm DTT, pH 8.0, and stored at −20 °C. The isolated protein showed no visible contamination with other proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The rho gene from BCM-resistant E. coli strains BCMr102, BCMr108, and BCMr110 (10Zwiefka A. Kohn H. Widger W.R.

The resulting amplified DNA was digested with BclI and KpnI and ligated into the BclI-KpnI linearized pET-RhoW plasmid. The pET-RhoW plasmid was grown in the dam − strain, SCS110, to allow the digestion of the BclI site. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into the host strain JM107. Plasmids showing correct restriction patterns were sequenced, and the proper base substitution was confirmed. The plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS, and mutant Rho proteins were overexpressed, as described for the wild-type Rho. By using PCR amplification of plasmid DNA containing the wild-typerho gene with two synthetic oligonucleotide primers, aSalI restriction site was introduced 88 bases upstream of the start codon of the rho gene. One primer, d(CATGAGTCGACGACCGTAAAC), contained a single-base mismatch T to C (in boldface) at nucleotide position 381 (GenBankTMaccession number J01674), which generated a unique SalI site (GTCGAC). The other primer, d(GTAGGAGCTGTCTGCGGA), was complementary to the wild-type rho gene at nucleotide positions 1575–1594. The PCR product was digested with SalI and KpnI, purified from agarose, and ligated into the SalI- and KpnI-linearized bacterial phage M13mp19 RF DNA. Single-stranded phage DNA was isolated from cells and sequenced to confirm the subcloning of wild-type rho gene. PCR reactions were carried out in buffer solution containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.4 μm of each oligonucleotide primer, 4 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 μg of plasmid DNA in 0.05 ml total volume at 95 °C for 10 min followed by the addition of Pfu DNA polymerase. Single-strand M13 phage DNA containing the wild-type rho gene was isolated from E. coli strain SDM by infection with the phage particles obtained from E. coli strain JM109. Oligonucleotide primer 5′-CGAGTGATGCAGTCGAG CA-3′ bearing the Tyr codon was phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The second strand (mutant strand) was selectively methylated by incorporating 5-methyl-dCTP during the synthesis reaction using T7 DNA polymerase. The resulting hemi-methylated DNA was digested withMspI followed by treatment with ExoIII. Uncopied single-strand DNA was removed by adding HhaI during restriction digestion. The remaining mutated methylated single-strand DNA was then transformed into E. coli strain SDM. Mutants were selected by isolating single-strand phage DNA and identified by DNA sequencing using M13 (−40) universal primer. Phage that contained the desired mutated rho gene were allowed to infect the E. coli strain SCS110. The mutated rhogenes were then removed from phage RF DNA by treatment withBclI and KpnI, and the resulting fragment was ligated into the BclI and KpnI sites of the linearized His-tagged Rho overexpression vector pET-RhoW. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Transcription termination assays were carried using a modified trp operon (45Wu A.M. Christie G.E. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) as described (37Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25369-25374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction was carried out in a 10-μl volume with 200 μm ATP, CTP, GTP, and 20 μmUTP, 7 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, 0.1 pmol of template, 0.4 units/ml RNase inhibitor, 0.01 μg/μl E. coli RNA polymerase, and 70 nm Rho protein in the presence or absence of BCM. The reactions were carried out for 20 min at 37 °C, diluted with 100 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and carrier tRNA at 0.8 mg/ml, extracted with phenol, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in gel loading buffer. The RNA transcripts were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea and were visualized by drying the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and allowing them to expose a PhosphorImager plate (Fuji Photo Film Co., Japan) for approximately 30 min. Exposed plates were scanned using a Fuji BAS1000 BioImaging Analyzer. The data were collected and analyzed using a MacIntosh BAS analysis program. Quantitation of the termination assays was done by subtracting the digitized background from both the read-through transcript and the Rho-terminated transcripts. Percent of termination by Rho was determined as the amount of Rho-terminated transcripts divided by the read-through transcript plus the Rho-terminated transcripts. The poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity was measured as described (36Park H. Zhang X. Moon H. Zwiefka A. Cox K. Gaskell S.J. Widger W.R. Kohn H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 447-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were initiated by adding ATP (9.1–100 μm) and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP to the solution containing 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 12 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.07 mg of bovine serum albumin, 24 μm poly(C), and 70 nm Rho or mutants. Aliquots were removed at various times after the start of the reaction, and the 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate and ATP were separated on Baker-Flex cellulose polyethyleneimine TLC plates using 0.75 m potassium phosphate, pH 3.5, as the mobile phase (46Sharp J.A. Galloway J.L. Platt T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3482-3486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The TLC plates were exposed to PhosphorImager plates for 15–30 min and scanned using a Fuji BAS1000 BioImaging Analyzer and analyzed using a MacIntosh BAS analysis program. The initial rates of the reactions were determined by plotting the amounts of ATP hydrolyzed versus time. Poly(dC)·ribo(C)10-dependent ATPase activity assays were carried out in 20-μl reactions containing 30 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 0.4 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.015 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 3.2 μm poly(dC)9ribo(C)10 (0.7–14 μm), 18 nm Rho protein, and 0–1000 μm BCM. Reactions were preincubated at 32 °C for 2 min prior to adding ATP. Aliquots (2 μl) were removed periodically (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 s) during the reaction and spotted onto the TLC plates. Plates were analyzed as described previously. Polycytidylate (poly(C)) was labeled at the 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP in reactions containing 50 pmol of poly(C), 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/μmol), and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C (30 min) and then at 70 °C (10 min) and loaded on a polyacrylamide gel. The desired length of oligomer (approximately 130 nucleotides) was cut out, eluted, and recovered by ethanol precipitation. Binding of poly(C) to Rho was done in binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA) and 0–113 nm Rho in a total volume of 100 μl. Rho with or without BCM (1 mm) was preincubated at 4 °C (2 min), and approximately 25 pm (final concentration) of 5′ end32P-labeled poly(C) was added. Each reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C (1 min) followed by filtration of 50 μl of the reaction solution using 25-mm HA nitrocellulose filters presoaked with 0.1 mg/ml RNA. The filters were washed twice with 0.5 ml of buffer, dried briefly, and measured in a scintillation counter. Our investigation focused on mutations introduced at amino acid positions 219, 266, and 337 in Rho, since single amino acid changes at these sites conferred BCM resistance. These Rho proteins were expressed with a His-tag using the pET-14b vector. The wild-type rho gene was PCR-amplified with Pfu polymerase using an upstream primer with a single base change thus creating a new NdeI site at the start codon. The amplified DNA was digested withNdeI and ligated into pET-14b at the NdeI site. Protein expression was initiated by inducing the T7 polymerase (underlac control) by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the cells. A mutagenesis cartridge was constructed to allow overexpression of mutant Rho protein using the wild-type overexpression system. This was accomplished by replacing the BclI-KpnI DNA fragment from the wild-type plasmid with the BclI-KpnI fragment isolated from M219K, S266A, and G337S. The wild-type plasmid was grown in SCS110 (dam −), a"

Repair is independent of the mismatch repair proteins MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2 and occurs by a mechanism that is distinct from that of the conventional mismatch repair system.

Base pairing anomalies can occur within the DNA helix as a consequence of DNA biosynthetic errors or as a result of recombinational strand transfer between sequences that differ genetically (1Streisinger G.

Such pairing errors may take the form of base-base mismatches or insertion/deletion (I/D) 1The abbreviations used are: I/D, insertion/deletion; V, viral; C, complementary; bp, base pair(s) 1The abbreviations used are: I/D, insertion/deletion; V, viral; C, complementary; bp, base pair(s) heterologies, in which one strand contains a segment of one or more unpaired nucleotides.

Base-base mispairs are subject to strand-specific correction by the mismatch repair systems of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (5Kolodner R.

The Escherichia coli mismatch repair pathway will correct I/D heterologies up to about 7 unpaired nucleotides, but larger heterologies are poorly processed by this system (10Dohet C. Dzidic S.

A similar specificity is characteristic of the human mismatch repair system, which can correct I/D heterologies up to about 8 unpaired nucleotides (14Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H.

There is evidence, in some cases contradictory, that both prokaryotes and eukaryotes can rectify I/D heterologies with larger unpaired segments by a pathway distinct from the mismatch repair system. Using transfection assay, Dohet et al. (10Dohet C. Dzidic S. Wagner R. Radman M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) demonstrated rectification of a bacteriophage λ heteroduplex containing an 800-nucleotide unpaired IS1 heterology by a pathway that was independent of mutH, mutL, and mutS gene function. In contrast, Carraway and Marinus (12Carraway M. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) failed to detect repair of large heterologies upon transformation of covalently closed circular plasmid heteroduplexes into wild type E. coli.Although strand breaks are known to be required for efficient correction by conventional mismatch repair systems (6Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 17Claverys J.-P. Lacks S.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 133-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a potential activating role for strand discontinuities in large heterology repair in E. coli has not been reported. Transformation of monkey cells with heteroduplex DNAs containing unpaired single-stranded loops has indicated that mammalian cells can rectify such structures (18Ayares D. Ganea D. Chekuri L. Campbell C.R. Kucherlapati R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1656-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Weiss U. Wilson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 1989; 15: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Heterology repair as scored by transformation assay is biased about 2:1 for heterology removal (19Weiss U. Wilson J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the presence of a single-strand break near the unpaired loop was found to alter repair outcomes to a significant but limited degree (21Weiss U. Wilson J.H. Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 1989; 15: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments have also suggested that human cells possess a system distinct from the mismatch repair pathway for processing heteroduplexes with large I/D heterologies. For example, Umar et al. (15Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) found that incised heteroduplexes containing 8- and 16-nucleotide I/D mismatches were repaired in nick-directed fashion in extracts of a mismatch repair-defectiveMLH1 –/– cell line. Similar results have been obtained by Genschel et al. (16Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that a nicked heteroduplex containing an 8-nucleotide I/D heterology is processed in a strand-specific manner and to similar extents by the mismatch repair system and by a second pathway that is independent of MSH2 function. A 27-nucleotide I/D heterology was shown to be processed only by the latter system. Although the asymmetric rectification of the larger I/D heterologies in both of these studies was consistent with nick direction, definitive conclusions on this point have been precluded by the fact that individual heterologies were tested in only one strand orientation. Furthermore, the nicks responsible for putative strand direction in these studies were located 5′ to the I/D heterology; the effect of 3′ nick placement was not tested, nor was the dependence of the efficiency of rectification on the presence of a strand break. In order to further define the nature of the reaction responsible for repair of large extrahelical segments, we have constructed a set of heteroduplexes containing unpaired I/D loops of 12–993 nucleotides, evaluated the dependence of repair on presence and placement of a single-strand break, and tested the possibility that strand placement of a genetic heterology may confer asymmetry on the rectification process. A set of f1MR bacteriophages for construction of heteroduplex DNAs has been previously described (14Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A. Kinzler K.W.

Bacteriophage f1MR1 was derived from f1h1 by elimination of the ClaI site at position 6040 by oligonucleotide mutagenesis, followed by insertion of a 27-base pair synthetic duplex into the EcoRI site at position 5617, destroying the latter site (23Lahue R.S.

Phage f1MR30 was constructed by insertion of a HindIII-NheI restriction fragment derived from plasmid pBR322 (coordinates 29–229) into HindIII, XbaI-cleaved f1MR1, whereas f1MR31 was constructed by insertion of a HindIII-XbaI fragment from plasmid pQE-30 (Qiagen, coordinates 187–1164) into f1MR1 digested in a similar manner. Heteroduplex DNAs were constructed by hybridization of restriction endonuclease-cleaved replicative form DNA to single strands isolated from f1MR virions (25Fang W. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Other heteroduplexes used in this study are summarized in Fig. 1, with the unpaired heterology placed either in the viral (V) or complementary (C) DNA strand as specified. For preparation of the heteroduplex containing a 62-nucleotide insertion in the C strand, the oligonucleotide d(CTAGAC(TG)19CA) (14Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N.

The presence of the oligonucleotide prevented the formation of branched complexes in which a phage viral strand hybridized to the 62-nucleotide unpaired segment within the heteroduplex. As judged by resistance to NheI (Fig. 1), isolated preparations of this heteroduplex were free of significant levels of the oligonucleotide. A similar problem, which could not be circumvented in this manner, was encountered in attempts to prepare heteroduplexes with larger insertions in the C strand. For this reason, unpaired 216- or 993-nucleotide heterologies were placed in the viral strand only. Heteroduplexes were prepared in covalently closed circular form or contained a site-specific, strand-specific nick as indicated. In the latter case, DNAs contained a strand break in the C strand at the Sau96I or HincII site, or in the V strand at the cleavage site for f1 gpII protein (25Fang W. Modrich P. J. Biol.

The human GM08437 cell line, which was obtained from the NIGMS/Coriell repository, was cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2× concentrations of essential amino acids, nonessential amino acids, and minimum essential medium vitamins. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Holmes et al.(27Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Unless specified otherwise, repair reactions (10 μl) contained 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.6); 0.11 m KCl; 1.5 mm ATP; 0.1 mm each dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and dCTP; 5 mm MgCl2; 24 fmol of heteroduplex DNA; and 50–75 μg of nuclear extract protein. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by addition of 30 μl of 25 mm EDTA, 0.07% SDS, and DNAs processed as described previously (27Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl.

Repair of heteroduplexes containing a large I/D heterology was scored by restriction endonuclease assay in a manner similar to that described previously for smaller heterologies (14Parsons R. Li G.M.

For example, heteroduplexes constructed using phage f1MR11 contain anEcoRI site in the f1MR11 strand at the junction of the heterology, with the unpaired segment containing an NheI site (Fig. 1). Repair to the deletion product confers EcoRI sensitivity, whereas repair to the insertion product renders the DNA sensitive to NheI cleavage. Trapping of intermediates resulting from excision of I/D heterologies was accomplished by omission of exogenous dNTPs from reactions and thereby restricting repair DNA synthesis (25Fang W. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Excision tract end points were mapped relative to an indicated restriction endonuclease cleavage site by indirect end labeling (31Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S.

After transfer and UV cross-linking to an ICN Biotrans nylon membrane, that portion of a heteroduplex strand of interest was visualized by probing with a 5′32P-labeled oligonucleotide that hybridized near the strand terminus produced by restriction cleavage (25Fang W. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides V2531 (d(ATGGTTTCATTGGTGACGTT), corresponding to f1MR11 viral strand nucleotides 2531–2550) and V5216 (d(ATTGTTCTGGATATTACCAG), corresponding to viral strand nucleotides 5216–5235) were used as probes to end label complementary strand products produced byBsp106 or SspI cleavage (Fig. 1). Labeled species were visualized by exposure of membranes to Kodak XAR-5 film, and radioactivity was quantitated by analysis of film with cooled charge-coupled device imager (Photometrics) or by PhosphorImager analysis. Although the human mismatch repair system is able to repair I/D mismatches in a nick-directed, strand-specific manner (14Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N.

Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar), the activity of this system on such structures appears to be restricted to heterologies containing less than about eight unpaired nucleotides (15Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Incised heteroduplexes containing 12-, 16-, and 27-nucleotide I/D heterologies are also processed by human nuclear extracts, but in these cases, rectification is independent of MSH2 and MLH1 mismatch repair proteins (15Umar A. Boyer J.C. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1994; 266: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Although repair of such structures has been found to occur on the incised DNA strand, the role of the nick in directing the reaction has been uncertain due to the fact that the tested substrates contained the heterology in only one of the two possible unpaired configurations. Hence, it has been unclear whether the observed repair asymmetry is due to presence of a strand break or to asymmetry imposed on the DNA by the unpaired heterology itself. In order to clarify the nature of this reaction, we have constructed a set of circular heteroduplexes containing unpaired heterologies ranging in size from 12 to 993 nucleotides (Fig. 1), in several cases in both possible configurations, and have evaluated the role of strand-specific single-strand breaks in the processing of such structures. We designate these heteroduplexes according to the DNA strand containing the unpaired segment, the number of unpaired nucleotides in the heterology, and placement of the strand break 5′ or 3′ to the heterology as viewed along the shorter path joining the two DNA sites in the circular DNA. In this convention, 5′-C27 indicates a heteroduplex containing an unpaired 27-nucleotide loop in the complementary DNA strand with the strand break located 5′ to the heterology, whereas 3′-V216 refers to the heteroduplex with a 216-nucleotide unpaired segment in the viral strand with the nick located 3′ to the heterology. With all of the substrates used, heterology rectification and any associated strand specificity can be monitored by restriction endonuclease assay (Fig. 1). As summarized in Table I, unpaired heterologies of 27 or 216 nucleotides were subject to limited processing in HeLa nuclear extracts when present in a covalently closed circular DNA. However, heterologies in this size range were efficiently rectified in open circular DNAs containing a single-strand break 114 or 797 bp 5′ to the unpaired region in the 6.4-kilobase pair circular heteroduplexes (Fig. 2 and Table I). Repair of these DNAs displayed a substantial bias (4–18-fold) toward the incised DNA strand, although significant repair was detected on the closed DNA strand in some cases (see Fig. 2, 5′-C62 heteroduplex). The efficiency of nick-directed correction of these large heterologies was 30–70% of that observed for a G-T mismatch or T, A, or GT I/D mispairs, all of which are processed by the conventional mismatch repair system (14Parsons R.

Significant repair with some strand bias was also observed for the 5′-heteroduplex containing a 993-nucleotide unpaired region, but this substrate was processed less well than those containing the smaller nonhomologous segments.Table ISubstrate specificity of large heterology repairHeterologyRepairC strand nick (5′)V strand nick (3′)CC circleCVCVCVfmol/15 minC273.1 ± 0.720.17 ± 0.110.75 ± 0.730.62 ± 0.760.55 ± 0.070.76 ± 0.99V274.6 ± 1.01.2 ± 0.440.74 ± 0.421.1 ± 0.800.70 ± 0.540.41 ± 0.18C623.9 ± 0.561.1 ± 0.56V623.9 ± 0.841.0 ± 0.08V2166.5 ± 1.30.46 ± 0.421.5 ± 0.630.72 ± 0.550.94 ± 0.480.65 ± 0.23V216(H)4.5 ± 1.30.89 ± 0.24V9931.9 ± 0.240.82 ± 0.28C110 ± 1.72.3 ± 0.8V110 ± 2.12.9 ± 1.3V27.9 ± 2.31.7 ± 0.400.10 ± 0.209.5 ± 1.30.80 ± 0.701.5 ± 0.60G-T9.2 ± 3.21.3 ± 1.11.8 ± 0.2011 ± 1.2Repair reactions (see under “Experimental Procedures”) contained 75 μg of HeLa nuclear extract. 5′-Heteroduplexes contained a strand break in the C DNA strand at the Sau96I site (114 bp 5′ to the heterology) or in the case of the V216(H) heteroduplex at the HincII site (797 bp 5′ to the heterology). 3′-Heteroduplexes contained an incision in the V strand at the gpII cleavage site (170 bp from the heterology).

Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and the last two entries of Table I). As described above, a single-strand break located 114 or 797 bp 5′ to the heterology supports strand-specific repair of 27-, 62-, and 216-nucleotide heterologies. However, a nick located 170 bp 3′ to the heterology was ineffective in this respect. As can be seen in Table I and Fig. 3, repair of 3′-C27, 3′-V27, and 3′-V216 heteroduplexes was not significantly different from that observed with the corresponding covalently closed, circular substrates, and no strand specificity was evident in the low level repair values obtained with any of these 3′-heteroduplexes. It is important to note that whereas all of the 5′-heteroduplexes used in this study contained the strand break in the complementary strand, tested substrates included several with the unpaired nonhomology present in either the complementary or viral strand (Table I). When the nonhomologous segment was present in the C strand, processing of the 5′-heteroduplex produced the deletion repair product, whereas presence of the nonhomology in the V strand yielded the insertion repair product. Consequently, the strand-specific asymmetry observed for repair of 5′-heteroduplexes cannot be attributed to the simple presence of an unpaired segment in a particular DNA strand. Rather, this effect must be due to the 5′ strand break. This conclusion is also consistent with the finding that unpaired heterologies of 27–216 nucleotides are processed only at a basal level and without evident strand bias when present in closed circula"
https://openalex.org/W2015892667,"We previously identified a major enhancer of the mouse ferritin H gene (FER-1) that is central to repression of the ferritin H gene by the adenovirus E1A oncogene (Tsuji, Y., Akebi, N., Lam, T. K., Nakabeppu, Y., Torti, S. V., and Torti, F. M. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 5152–5164). To dissect the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation of ferritin H, E1A mutants were tested for their ability to repress FER-1 enhancer activity using cotransfection with ferritin H-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter constructs. Here we report that p300/CBP transcriptional adaptor proteins are involved in the regulation of ferritin H transcription through the FER-1 enhancer element. Thus, E1A mutants that failed to bind p300/CBP lost the ability to repress FER-1, whereas mutants of E1A that abrogated its interaction with Rb, p107, or p130 were fully functional in transcriptional repression. Transfection with E1A did not affect endogenous p300/CBP levels, suggesting that repression of FER-1 by E1A is not due to repression of p300/CBP synthesis, but to E1A and p300/CBP interaction. In addition, we have demonstrated that transfection of a p300 expression plasmid significantly activated ferritin H-CAT containing the FER-1 enhancer, but had a marginal effect on ferritin H-CAT with FER-1 deleted. Furthermore, both wild-type p300 and a p300 mutant that failed to bind E1A but retained an adaptor function restored FER-1 enhancer activity repressed by E1A. Sodium butyrate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, mimicked p300/CBP function in activation of ferritin H-CAT and elevation of endogenous ferritin H mRNA, suggesting that the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP or its associated proteins may contribute to the activation of ferritin H transcription. Recruitment of these broadly active transcriptional adaptor proteins for ferritin H synthesis may represent an important mechanism by which changes in iron metabolism are coordinated with other cellular responses mediated by p300/CBP. We previously identified a major enhancer of the mouse ferritin H gene (FER-1) that is central to repression of the ferritin H gene by the adenovirus E1A oncogene (Tsuji, Y., Akebi, N., Lam, T.

Recruitment of these broadly active transcriptional adaptor proteins for ferritin H synthesis may represent an important mechanism by which changes in iron metabolism are coordinated with other cellular responses mediated by p300/CBP. Ferritin is the major cellular iron-binding protein in eucaryotic cells. It is composed of 24 subunits of two types (termed ferritin H and ferritin L) that are assembled in various ratios in different tissue and disease states, including inflammation and cancer (reviewed in Refs. 1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar and 2Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Iron is a potent regulator of ferritin synthesis. In the past decade, a number of elegant studies have shown that iron coordinately regulates both the H and L subunits of ferritin at a post-transcriptional level through the interaction of an iron-responsive element with its binding proteins (reviewed in Ref.3Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that ferritin is also subject to transcriptional regulation. Transcription of the ferritin H gene is preferentially modulated by cytokines (4Torti S.V. Kwak E.L. Miller S.C. Miller L.L. Ringold G.M. Myambo K.B. Young A.P. Torti F.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20281-20288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preferential alteration of ferritin H synthesis in response to these stimuli may be an adaptive cellular response since ferritin H appears to be responsible for more rapid iron uptake than ferritin L (10Wagstaff M. Worwood M. Jacobs A. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and may therefore protect cells from oxidative stress mediated by iron. In fact, it has been reported that oxidative stress stimulates ferritin H and L synthesis at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (11Cairo G. Tacchini L. Pogliaghi G. Anzon E. Tomasi A. Bernelli-Zazzera A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 700-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Some studies have demonstrated that ferritin synthesis is elevated in tumor tissues compared with their normal counterparts (12Cairo G. Vezzoni P. Bardella L. Schiaffonati L. Rappocciolo E. Levi S.

Griffiths K. Blamey R.W. Eur. J. Surg. Oncol. 1990; 16: 22-27PubMed Google Scholar), although little is known about the molecular mechanism and biological meaning of the increase in ferritin associated with malignancy. Recent studies have suggested that ferritin H may function as an autocrine growth factor for some tumors (17Kikyo N. Suda M. Kikyo N. Hagiwara K. Yasukawa K. Fujisawa M. Yazaki Y. Okabe T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 268-271PubMed Google Scholar, 18Blatt J. Wharton V. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 139-143PubMed Google Scholar). An appreciation of mechanisms regulating ferritin synthesis is critical to understanding these responses. We have previously reported that the adenovirus E1A oncogene selectively represses transcription of the ferritin H gene in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts (8Tsuji Y. Kwak E. Saika T. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7270-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced ferritin transcription in E1A-expressing cells may contribute to their enhanced sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor cytotoxicity (19Tsuji Y. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1897-1907PubMed Google Scholar). Repression of ferritin H by E1A is also consonant with numerous reports showing that E1A can repress markers of cell differentiation (20Beck Jr., G.R. Sullivan E.C. Moran E. Zerler B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 68: 1-12Google Scholar). Extensive studies on the mechanism of action of E1A have revealed that many of its pleiotropic effects on gene transcription are mediated by interaction with important and broadly active intracellular regulators. These include members of the Rb 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene; PCAF, p300/cBP-associated factor; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; CAT chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, CMV, cytomegalovirus 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene; PCAF, p300/cBP-associated factor; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; CAT chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, CMV, cytomegalovirus tumor suppressor family (p105Rb, p107, and p130) as well as p300 and CBP (CREB-bindingprotein). p300 and CBP are functionally related transcriptional coactivators with intrinsic histone acetylase activity that link key transcription factors (including nuclear hormone receptors, MyoD, Fos, Jun, CREB, and p53) to the basal transcriptional machinery (reviewed in Ref. 21Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that p300 plays a role in cell cycle control, inhibiting exit from the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle and stimulating differentiation (22Mymryk J.S. Lee R.W.H. Bayley S.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Eckner R. Yao T.-P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M.

Virol. 1995; 69: 7917-7924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p300/CBP thus functions as a nodal point in mediating cellular responses to a broad range of intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 21Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified an E1A-responsive element (termed FER-1) in the 5′-flanking region of the mouse ferritin H gene (26Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). FER-1 serves as a basal enhancer of the mouse ferritin H gene. FER-1 comprises two elements, an AP1-like sequence followed by a dyad symmetry element, both of which are essential for maximal FER-1 enhancer activity (26Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Very recently, we identified transcription factors that directly bind to the FER-1 element: JunD, FosB, and ATF1 (bound to the AP1-like sequences) and Sp1 and Sp3 (bound to the C-rich sequences in the dyad) (27Tsuji Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2984-2992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our discovery of the regulation of ferritin H by E1A allowed us to further dissect and explore the relationship between binding of these transcription factors and functional modulation of ferritin H synthesis. To study the possible involvement of E1A-associated proteins in the regulation of ferritin H transcription via FER-1, we utilized E1A mutant proteins defective in their ability to associate with selected E1A target proteins. Here we demonstrate that 1) the functional region of E1A containing the p300/CBP-binding domain contributes to the repression of endogenous ferritin H mRNA; 2) E1A point mutants defective in the p300/CBP-binding domain fail to repress ferritin H transcription; 3) p300 is able to restore ferritin H enhancer activity repressed by E1A; 4) in the absence of E1A, p300 and CBP are able to activate FER-1 enhancer activity; and 5) sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, is able to mimic the p300/CBP effect in terms of the activation of endogenous ferritin H mRNA synthesis as well as ferritin H-CAT. These results suggest that p300/CBP is an additional component that regulates the transcription of the mouse ferritin H gene via the FER-1 element. Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA). Stable NIH3T3 transfectants expressing E1A or E1A mutant proteins (pools of >100 independent clones) were cultured as described previously (19Tsuji Y. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1897-1907PubMed Google Scholar). All CAT reporter constructs used in this study have been described previously (26Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, expression of CAT in pBluescript KS(−)−4.8kbFHCAT is driven by the 5′-flanking region of the mouse ferritin H gene from nucleotides −4819 to +24, containing the FER-1 enhancer element. pBluescript KS(−)−4kbAP1FHCAT transcription is driven by nucleotides −4060 to +24 of the mouse ferritin H gene, containing an AP1(NF-E2) site, but not FER-1. pBluescript KS(−)−4kbAP1+δFHCAT transcription is driven by nucleotides −4109 to +24 of the mouse ferritin H gene, containing FER-1. The human p300 expression plasmids CMVβp300 and CMVβp300del30 (deletion of amino acids 1737–1809 in the E1A-binding region of p300) were kindly provided by R. Eckner (University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland) (28Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The mouse CBP expression plasmid pRc/RSV-mCBP-HA was a generous gift from R. Goodman (Vollum Institute, Portland, OR) (29Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montominy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). The E1A plasmids used in this study have been described elsewhere (24Stein R.W. Corrigan M. Yaciuk P. Whelan J. Moran E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wang H.-G.H. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient DNA transfection into NIH3T3 cells was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (19Tsuji Y. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1897-1907PubMed Google Scholar) with the following minor modifications. Cells were plated in duplicate at a density of 3.5 × 105/60-mm dish containing 4 ml of the culture medium. After incubation for 16–24 h, 400 μl of calcium phosphate/DNA precipitate solution containing 5 μg of a CAT reporter plasmid plus a total 5 μg of p12SE1A, the human p300 plasmid, or the mouse CBP plasmid was added to the culture and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 16–24 h. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by further incubation for 16–24 h in culture medium. CAT assays were carried out as described previously (8Tsuji Y. Kwak E. Saika T. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7270-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium butyrate was purchased from Sigma. Expression of endogenous p300/CBP and various E1A mutants transiently transfected into NIH3T3 cells was estimated by Western blotting as described previously (31Tsuji Y. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using the same cell extract as used in measuring CAT activity. An anti-p300 monoclonal antibody (NM11) that reacts with both p300 and CBP (32Dallas P.B. Yaciuk P. Moran E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1726-1731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to detect p300/CBP proteins. The anti-E1A antibody M58 was a generous gift from E. Harlow (Harvard Medical School). Ferritin mRNA was analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (8Tsuji Y. Kwak E. Saika T. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7270-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the E1A oncogene preferentially represses the H subunit of the ferritin gene in NIH3T3 cells (8Tsuji Y. Kwak E. Saika T. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7270-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the involvement of functional domains of E1A in ferritin H repression, we measured the mRNA level of ferritin in NIH3T3 cells that were stably transfected with intact E1A or E1A mutants in which the E1A region containing conserved region 1 (Δ23–107) or conserved regions 1 and 2 (Δ23–150) was deleted. Mutants of E1A containing conserved region 1 deletions are impaired in binding to p300/CBP; conserved region 2 deletions interfere with binding to the pocket proteins p105Rb, p107, and p130 (reviewed in Ref.33Mymryk J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1581-1589PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA isolated from control vector (Hyg and HygSRα)- or E1A (intact E1A, Δ23–107, and Δ23–150)-transfected cells was analyzed by Northern blotting after successive hybridization with cDNA probes for ferritin H, ferritin L, and β-actin. As we reported previously, expression of intact E1A repressed the mRNA for the H subunit of ferritin in the absence of any effect on the mRNA for the L subunit of ferritin or β-actin (Fig. 1). In contrast, deletion of the E1A region containing conserved region 1 (Δ23–107, two independent cell pools (A and B)) or conserved regions 1 and 2 (Δ23–150) completely impaired the ability of E1A to repress ferritin H. The expression level of these E1A mutant proteins was higher than that of intact E1A protein (data not shown) (19Tsuji Y. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1897-1907PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the functional region of E1A containing the p300-binding domain and conserved region 1 contributes to the repression of ferritin H. To further investigate the domain of E1A required for transcriptional repression of the ferritin H gene, a series of E1A mutants defective in association with either p300 or the Rb family proteins (Rb, p107, or p130) were cotransfected with −4.8kbFHCAT, our largest ferritin H 5′-fragment fused to the CAT gene, into NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2A). The E1A mutants that retained the ability to associate with all these cellular proteins (DA21, LP49, EV55, and Δ81–120) repressed ferritin H enhancer activity as efficiently as wild-type E1A (12Swt). Comparable repression of the ferritin H enhancer was seen by E1A mutants blocked in the ability to interact with Rb and p130 (YH47) or Rb, p107, and p130 (YH47/928). In contrast, mutations that interfered with p300 interaction, but not with the Rb family proteins (Δ2–36, Δ15–35, and RG2), significantly reduced the ability of E1A to repress ferritin H. Loss of ferritin H repression was similarly observed following cotransfection of −4.8kbFHCAT with E1A mutants containing two point mutations (RG2/928) that abrogate the interaction of E1A with both p300 and Rb family members. Similar expression levels of all E1A proteins were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). Endogenous p300 levels were not altered by E1A transfection (Fig. 2B), suggesting that repression of the ferritin H enhancer by E1A is not due to repression of p300 synthesis by E1A, but rather is dependent on the interaction of E1A with p300. p300 was initially identified as an E1A-associated protein (34Yee S.-P. Branton P.E. Virology. 1985; 147: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 35Harlow E. Whyte P. Franza R.B. Schley C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have demonstrated that p300 has a structural homology to CBP (36Arany Z. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Cell. 1994; 77: 799-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) as well as a functional similarity to CBP (37Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 38Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P.S. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1995; 374: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) as a coactivator of transcription factors such as CREB and AP1 (39Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 40Arias J. Alberts A.S. Brindle P. Claret F.X. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). We previously identified an element (termed FER-1) as responsible for transcriptional repression of the mouse ferritin H gene by E1A (26Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). FER-1 is a 37-base pair composite element that binds AP1 and Sp1 family members and functions as a basal enhancer of the mouse ferritin H gene through the cooperative action of these two families of transcription factors (27Tsuji Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2984-2992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results and the data obtained in Fig. 2, taken together with evidence for the interaction between p300/CBP and some members of the AP1 family (41Lee J.-S. See R.H. Deng T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4312-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 42Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), prompted us to test whether or not p300 and CBP contribute to ferritin H enhancer activity through FER-1. To test this possibility, we first carried out cotransfection experiments using a p300 or CBP expression plasmid and −4.8kbFHCAT. As shown in Fig. 3, both p300 and CBP activated ferritin H transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Activation was also seen with p300del30, a mutant of p300 that retains transcriptional adaptor activity (28Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). These functional assays thus demonstrate that p300/CBP activates the ferritin H promoter. To assess the involvement of the FER-1 element in ferritin H enhancer activation by p300, we then performed cotransfection of a p300 expression plasmid with ferritin H-CAT that lacks FER-1 (−4kbAP1) or contains FER-1 (−4kbAP1+δ). p300 by itself significantly activated FER-1(+)FHCAT in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). In contrast, only a weak activation of CAT by p300 was observed in FER-1(−)FHCAT (this weak activation may be due to the existence of another potential p300-targeted sequence on the mouse ferritin H gene; see “Discussion”). These results suggest that the p300 adaptor protein activates the ferritin H enhancer via the FER-1 element. We then asked whether E1A repressed ferritin H transcription by targeting p300. To this end, a FER-1-containing ferritin H-CAT plasmid was cotransfected with an E1A expression plasmid together with either wild-type p300 or a p300 deletion mutant (p300del30) that is defective for interaction with E1A, but is active as an adaptor (28Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). CAT activity driven by the FER-1-containing ferritin H promoter was ∼60% repressed by 12SE1A (Fig. 5). Cotransfection of wild-type p300 resulted in ∼80% restoration of E1A-mediated repression of CAT activity, and p300del30 completely restored the CAT activity repressed by E1A. A control vector (pCMV) had no effect (Fig. 5). The fact that p300del30 efficiently antagonized E1A-mediated ferritin H repression (p300del30 cannot associate with E1A, but retains a transcriptional adaptor function) suggests that the CAT activity restored by p300 protein is not simply due to sequestration of E1A, but rather to transcriptional activation of the ferritin H enhancer by p300. It has recently been demonstrated that p300 and CBP both bind to the histone acetylase PCAF (49Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J.-i. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar) and possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (43Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). To test the importance of histone acetylation in transcriptional activation of the ferritin H gene, sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, was employed to investigate whether sodium butyrate can mimic p300/CBP function in ferritin H transcription. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with a CAT reporter plasmid driven by the ferritin H promoter/enhancer, followed by treatment with a different concentration of sodium butyrate. As shown in Fig. 6, sodium butyrate increased CAT activity up to 2-fold in a dose-dependent fashion, an increase comparable to the 2–3-fold activation of ferritin H-CAT by p300 or CBP (Fig. 3). We also tested the effect of sodium butyrate on endogenous ferritin H mRNA expression by Northern blotting. These experiments demonstrated that ferritin H mRNA was induced 2.4-fold by 2 mm sodium butyrate and 3.0-fold by 10 mm sodium butyrate after 24 h (Fig. 6). These results indicate that conditions that block histone deacetylation activate ferritin H transcription and suggest that the histone acetyltransferase activity of p300/CBP or its associated proteins may contribute to its activation of the FER-1 enhancer and elevation of ferritin H transcription. We previously observed that E1A preferentially represses transcription of the ferritin H gene in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts, resulting in an alteration of the H/L subunit ratio of ferritin (8Tsuji Y. Kwak E. Saika T. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7270-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the ferritin H gene and its repression by the E1A oncogene, we used deletion and mutational analyses to investigate an E1A-responsive element in the mouse ferritin H gene. These studies defined a 37-base pair element (termed FER-1) as both the E1A-responsive element and a basal enhancer of the mouse ferritin H gene (26Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). FER-1, located 4.1 kilobases upstream from the transcription initiation site, comprises an AP1-like element followed by an element with dyad symmetry (26Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our recent studies have identified the nuclear factors bound to these two elements of FER-1: the AP1-like element has the ability to bind JunD, FosB, and ATF1, and the C-rich sequences in the dyad symmetry can bind Sp1 and Sp3 (27Tsuji Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2984-2992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Using recombinant ATF1 and Sp1, we have demonstrated that these transcription factors bind simultaneously to each element of FER-1 (27Tsuji Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2984-2992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), regulating ferritin H transcription by binding directly to FER-1 sequences. In this study, we have identified p300/CBP as an additional component required for FER-1 enhancer activity. Thus, E1A mutants that did not have a p300-binding region including conserved region 1 failed to repress the endogenous ferritin H gene (Fig. 1). Furthermore, in CAT reporter assays, E1A point mutants lacking the ability to bind p300 failed to repress FER-1, whereas E1A mutants defective in interaction with members of the Rb family retained the ability to repress FER-1 (Fig. 2A). Since endogenous p300/CBP levels were not affected by E1A expression (Fig. 2B), the mechanism of E1A-mediated repression of FER-1 enhancer activity is not due to down-regulation of p300/CBP synthesis by E1A, but to E1A and p300/CBP interaction. Overall, the transcriptional activity of the ferritin H promoter depends in a complex way on the AP1, Sp1, and p300/CBP transcription factor families. For example, although the Sp1/Sp3-binding component of FER-1 does not by itself confer enhancer activity, it is required for the enhancer activity of the AP1-like element of FER-1 to be expressed (26Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, cotransfection experiments have demonstrated that FosB and JunD directly activate ferritin H transcription. Thus, cotransfection of FosB, JunD, and ferritin H-CAT in F9 cells (which do not contain appreciable endogenous levels of AP1 (44Imler J.L. Ugarte E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) led to an ∼6-fold enhancement of ferritin H-CAT activity (27Tsuji Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2984-2992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As described here, p300/CBP also plays a role in ferritin H transcription, augmenting ferritin H-CAT activity 2–3-fold in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3) and BNL CL.2 cells. 2Y. Tsuji, E. Moran, S. V. Torti, and F. M. Torti, unpublished observations. This effect of p300/CBP on ferritin H transcription is within the range reported for the effects of p300/CBP on other enhancers (2–3-fold) (23Eckner R. Yao T.-P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 45Horvai A.E. Xu L. Korzus E. Brard G. Kalafus D. Mullen T.-M. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1074-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 46Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Furthermore, indirect evidence suggests that the phosphorylation status of p300 may influence its ability to function as a coactivator in ferritin H transcription. Thus, in undifferentiated F9 cells, p300 is poorly phosphorylated and possesses weak coactivator activity; however, both phosphorylation and coactivator activity increase following differentiation of F9 cells (47Kawasaki H. Song J. Eckner R. Ugai H. Chiu R. Taira K. Shi Y. Jones N. Yokoyama K.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 48Kitabayashi I. Eckner R. Arany Z. Chiu R. Gachelin G. Livingston D.M. Yokoyama K.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3496-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We observed that cotransfection of p300 and ferritin H-CAT into F9 cells resulted in a minimal augmentation of ferritin H-CAT activity over that seen with AP1 alone,2 despite the demonstrated functionality of the FER-1 element in F9 cells (27Tsuji Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2984-2992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This suggests that in cellular contexts in which p300 is poorly phosphorylated, the effect of p300 on ferritin H transcription may be blunted. It will be interesting to test this hypothesis by assessing the relationship between p300 phosphorylation and FER-1 enhancer activity during the differentiation of F9 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the activity and abundance of Sp1, AP1/ATF1, and p300/CBP transcription factor families collectively determine the activity of the FER-1 element of ferritin H in a complex and cell type-dependent fashion. What is the role of p300/CBP in the FER-1 complex? Recent work has suggested that p300 is more than a simple adaptor between DNA-binding proteins and transcription initiation factors. Thus, p300/CBP was shown to possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (43Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar) as well as to associate with PCAF, a protein that also functions in histone acetylation (49Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J.-i. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Since transcriptionally active chromatin is hyperacetylated (reviewed in Ref. 50Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), p300/CBP-mediated histone acetylation may function to facilitate access of transcription factors to the target sequences of DNA normally compacted in chromatin. Our experiments provide two lines of evidence that are consistent with a role for p300/CBP-mediated histone acetylation in FER-1 function. The first derives from the observation that E1A competes with PCAF for p300 interaction since they share an overlapping binding domain on the p300 protein (E1A binds amino acids 1572–1818 of p300 (28Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), and PCAF binds amino acids 1801–1851 of p300 (49Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J.-i. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar)). In our experiments, a p300 mutant lacking the E1A-binding domain (p300del30, deletion of amino acids 1737–1809 of p300) was able not only to activate ferritin H-CAT (Fig. 3), but to restore E1A-mediated repression of ferritin H-CAT (Fig. 5). We also examined the behavior of another p300 mutant, p300del33. This mutant contains a deletion encompassing 70% of the PCAF-binding region (amino acids 1737–1836) and is predicted to have little or no interaction with PCAF (49Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J.-i. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). In contrast to p300del30, p300del33 was unable to substantially augment ferritin H-CAT expression,2as was observed in the study of functional collaboration of p300 and C/EBPβ (CCAAT-box enhancer binding protein β) (51Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that activation of ferritin H by p300/CBP may require histone acetylation and, in particular, association p300/CBP with PCAF. The second line of evidence supporting the idea that histone acetylation plays an important role in ferritin H transcription is the observation that the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate can mimic p300/CBP as an activator of the endogenous ferritin H gene as well as ferritin H-CAT (Fig. 6). These results are consistent with previous observations (52Rouault T.A. Hentze M.W. Dancis A. Caughman W. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6335-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Based on the results obtained in this study, we suggest the model depicted in Fig. 7 for transcriptional regulation of the mouse ferritin H gene. We speculate that p300/CBP-mediated transcriptional activation of the ferritin H gene may be achieved, at least in part, by tethering the FER-1-binding complex to the basal transcription regulatory region (Fig. 7). This idea is supported by two observations. First, p300/CBP can associate with AP1/CREB family members including ATF1 (reviewed in Ref. 21Eckner R. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688PubMed Google Scholar), which were identified as components of the FER-1-binding complex; second, p300 and CBP were found to be components of the TATA-binding protein complexes (32Dallas P.B. Yaciuk P. Moran E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1726-1731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions at FER-1 may thus serve to target p300/CBP and its associated histone acetylase activity to the ferritin H promoter. Taken together with our prior results demonstrating a reduction in factors bound to the AP1-like element of FER-1 in the presence of E1A (26Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), this model suggests at least two mechanisms of E1A-mediated transcriptional repression of ferritin H. One is that E1A reduces the ability of factors to bind to the AP1-like element (26Tsuji Y. Akebi N. Lam T.K. Nakabeppu Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5152-5164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as has been reported for repression of the AP1 site in the collagenase gene by E1A (53Hagmeyer B.M. Konig H. Herr I. Offringa R. Zantema A. van der Eb A.J. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3559-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The other is that E1A removes p300 or CBP from the protein complexes of FER-1 and the TATA box. Both mechanisms may collaborate to decrease ferritin H transcription. Our results suggest that p300 plays an important role in ferritin H transcriptional activity through its interaction with FER-1. While this work was in progress, another potential target of p300/CBP in the ferritin H gene was identified. Bevilacqua et al. (54Bevilacqua M.A. Faniello M.C. Quaresima B. Tiano M.T. Giuliano P. Feliciello A. Avvedimento V.E. Cimino F. Costanzo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20736-20741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported the presence of a cyclic AMP-responsive element (B-site, −62 to −45 nucleotides upstream from the transcription initiation site) in the human ferritin H gene. They suggested that cAMP-mediated induction of human ferritin H transcription is inhibited by E1A through sequestration of p300/CBP. The B-site does not contain a canonical cAMP-responsive element sequence and was reported to bind a protein complex containing a 120-kDa protein and p300 (54Bevilacqua M.A. Faniello M.C. Quaresima B. Tiano M.T. Giuliano P. Feliciello A. Avvedimento V.E. Cimino F. Costanzo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20736-20741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This element overlaps an NF-Y-binding region containing a CCAAT box in inverse orientation, which is important in ferritin H induction during monocyte to macrophage differentiation (55Marziali G. Perrotti E. Ilari R. Testa U. Coccia E.M. Battistini A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Comparison of mouse and human proximal 5′-flanking sequences reveals 78% conservation in the B-site and complete conservation of the inverse CCAAT box (for mouse ferritin H DNA 5′-sequences (56Kwak E.L. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 94: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). Although this region does not function as a strong enhancer in the mouse ferritin H gene,2 it may have weak enhancer activity, and FER-1(−)FHCAT used in Fig. 4, which contains the B-site/CCAAT box, may have been slightly activated by p300. Thus, p300 may influence multiple regulatory elements in the ferritin H gene. However, our results indicate that p300/CBP activates transcription of the mouse ferritin H gene primarily through the FER-1 enhancer element. These results also suggest that similar mechanisms of E1A-mediated transcriptional repression of ferritin H are operative in both mouse and human genes, despite differences in functional roles and binding complexes between the FER-1 element and the B-site. What is the biological implication of the involvement of p300/CBP in the FER-1 enhancer activity of the ferritin H gene? One possibility is that p300/CBP may, at least in part, play a role in determining tissue-specific expression of ferritin H. FER-1 lies within the 180-nucleotide SacI-BglII fragment identified as responsible for the up-regulation of ferritin H in erythroid cells induced to differentiate withN,N′-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide (9Beaumont C. Seyhan A. Yachou A.-K. Grandchamp B. Jones R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20281-20288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the FER-1-binding complex (containing AP1 and Sp1 family members as well as p300/CBP) is involved inN,N′-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide-dependent induction of ferritin H in erythroid cells. However, it has been reported that cooperative interaction between AP1 and Sp1 family members may underlie myeloid-specific expression of the leukocyte integrin gene CD11c (57Noti J.D. Reinemann B.C. Petrus M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2940-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), suggesting that tissue-specific alterations in the constellation of proteins binding to FER-1 may similarly contribute to tissue-specific regulation of ferritin H in other cell types, including erythroid cells. In conjunction with transcription factors directly bound to FER-1, p300/CBP may also modulate ferritin H transcription during cell immortalization. It will be important to dissect the potentially changing composition of the FER-1-binding complex during these processes. In summary, we have demonstrated the involvement of p300/CBP in the basal enhancer activity of the mouse ferritin H gene via the FER-1 element, indicating that at least three families of factors (AP1/ATF, Sp1/Sp3, and p300/CBP) regulate ferritin H transcription through the FER-1 element. Environmental or intracellular events that target each of these, individually or collectively, may be expected to modulate ferritin H transcription. These molecular observations may help to explain the response of ferritin H to diverse cellular signals. We thank Drs. R. Eckner, R. Goodman, and E. Harlow for generously providing p300 expression plasmids, a CBP expression plasmid, and anti-E1A antibody, respectively."

Furthermore, the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 inhibited IL-2-driven T cell proliferation, suggesting that p38 MAP kinase might be involved in mediating proliferative signals. In this study, using transfected BA/F3 cell lines, it is shown that both the acidic domain and the membrane-proximal serine-rich region of the IL-2Rβ chain are required for p38 and p54 MAP kinase activation and that, as for p42/44 MAP kinase, this activation requires the Tyr338 residue of the acidic domain, the binding site for Shc. It is well established that the acidic domain of the IL-2Rβ chain is dispensable for IL-2-driven proliferation, and thus our observations suggest that neither p38 nor p54 MAP kinase activation is required for IL-2-driven proliferation of BA/F3 cells. In addition, the tetravalent guanylhydrazone inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokine production, CNI-1493, can block the activation of p54 and p38 MAP kinases by IL-2 but has no effect on IL-2-driven proliferation of BA/F3 cells, activated primary T cells, or a cytotoxic T cell line.

Science. 1988; 240: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). The intracellular signal transduction pathways activated by IL-2 and the relative roles of these pathways in mediating the mitogenic signal have been extensively studied but have yet to be fully elucidated. IL-2 exerts its cellular effects through binding to specific cell surface receptors. The high affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) is a heterotrimeric complex consisting of α-, β-, and γc-subunits, the γc subunit being shared with the receptors for the other T cell mitogens, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15 (2Theze J. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 481-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The α-subunit is responsible for conferring high affinity cytokine binding, while the β- and γc-subunits recruit cytoplasmic molecules, thereby transducing the proliferative signal. The β-subunit has the larger cytoplasmic tail, consisting of subdomains previously identified as the membrane-proximal serine-rich, acidic, and distal proline-rich regions (3Hatakeyama M. Tsudo M.

The IL-2Rβ chain contains six cytoplasmic tyrosine residues: Tyr338, Tyr355, Tyr358, and Tyr361, which lie in the acidic region, and Tyr392 and Tyr510, which lie within the proline-rich region. The presence of at least one of the tyrosines Tyr338, Tyr392, and Tyr510 appears to be sufficient to allow IL-2-driven proliferation (5Friedmann M.C. Migone T.S. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl.

However, we have recently demonstrated that p38 MAP kinase and p54 MAP kinase are activated by IL-2 in T cells (40Crawley J.B. Rawlinson L. Lali F.V. Page T.H. Saklatvala J. Foxwell B.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15023-15027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We observed that an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase function, SB203580 (39Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fidher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar), was able to inhibit T cell proliferation induced by IL-2, suggesting that p38 MAP kinase activation may be required for cell cycle progression. We have now examined further the role of these kinases in IL-2 proliferative signaling by mapping the regions of the IL-2Rβ chain required for p38 and p54 MAP kinase activation. We observe that both the serine-rich and the acidic regions are required for the activation of p54 and p38 MAP kinases by IL-2 in BA/F3 cells and that the activation of these kinases, like that of p42/44 MAP kinase, is dependent on the presence of Tyr338 in the IL-2Rβ chain and proceeds through the recruitment of Shc. Since the acidic region of the IL-2Rβ chain is dispensable for BA/F3 cell proliferation, our observations indicate that the activation of p38 and p54 MAP kinase is not required for IL-2-driven cell cycle progression. This conclusion is supported by studies using the tetravalent guanylhydrazone CNI-1493 (41Bianchi M. Ulrich P. Bloom O. Meistrell III, M. Zimmerman G.A. Schmidtmayerova H. Bukrinsky M. Donnelley T.

Med. 1995; 1: 254-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which inhibited IL-2-induced p38 and p54 MAP kinase activation but had no effect on IL-2-driven proliferation of either BA/F3 cells or T cells. Our data therefore suggest that the previously observed inhibition of IL-2-induced proliferation by the inhibitor SB203580 is likely to be due to its action on a target(s) other than p38 MAP kinase, which is required for cell cycle progression.

Antibodies to phosphorylated p42/44, p38, and p54 MAP kinases were from New England Biolabs. Antibodies to Shc and Grb2 and the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY-20 were from Transduction Labs (Lexington, KY). 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The cDNA for histidine-tagged MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 was the generous gift of Prof. M. Gaestel (Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany). Cellular DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously (45Willcocks J.L. Hales A. Page T.H. Foxwell B.M. Eur. J.

In vitro kinase assays for p54 and p38 MAP kinase activity were performed on precipitated immune complexes. p54 MAP kinase assays were performed as described previously using glutathione S-transferase-activating transcription factor 2 (GST-ATF2) as a substrate (40Crawley J.B.

In vitro kinase assays for p38 MAP kinase were performed using His6-MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 as a substrate. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 30 μl of kinase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate) containing 50 μg/ml recombinant His6-MAPK-activated protein kinase 2, 30 μm ATP, and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham International, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) for 25 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by the addition of gel sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. All substrates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried, and phosphorylated substrates were visualized using a Fuji FLA-2000 Imager (Raytek Scientific Ltd, Sheffield, UK) and by autoradiography at −70 °C. p42/44 MAP kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and phosphotyrosine Western blotting was performed as described previously (34Crawley J.B. Willcocks J. Foxwell B.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2717-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Western blotting for Shc, Grb2, and phosphorylated forms of p42/44, p38, and p54 MAP kinases was performed according to the antibody manufacturer's instructions. IL-3-dependent BA/F3 cells normally express both the α- and the γc-chains, but not the β-chain, of the IL-2R. When transfected with the IL-2Rβ subunit, they become responsive to IL-2 (4Hatakeyama M. Mori H. Doi T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 59: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). We have used BA/F3 cell lines expressing either the wild type IL-2Rβ chain (F7) or mutant forms of the IL-2Rβ chain, lacking either the serine-rich region (S25) or the acidic region (A15) (Fig. 1A), to examine the role of the IL-2Rβ chain subdomains in the activation of p38 and p54 MAP kinase. The serine-rich and the acidic domains of the β-chain are essential for p42/44 MAP kinase activation (30Minami Y. Oishi I. Liu Z.J. Nakagawa S. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5680-5690PubMed Google Scholar); this is confirmed in Fig. 2A by detection of the phosphorylated kinase by Western blotting using a phosphospecific p42/44 MAP kinase antibody. Using immunokinase assays (for p38 and p54; Fig. 2B) or Western blotting for the phosphorylated, activated form (p38 only, Fig. 2A) to measure p38 and p54 MAP kinase activation, we have shown that these kinases are stimulated by IL-2 in F7 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). However, IL-2 was unable to activate either p38 or p54 MAP kinase in the absence of the serine-rich (S25) or acidic (A15) regions, indicating that both regions are required for kinase activation. IL-3 activated p42, p38, and p54 MAP kinases in all three cell lines and is included as a positive control. Kinetic experiments examining p38 and p54 MAP kinase activation over a 2-h period have established that the activation of these kinases by IL-2 is not simply retarded in the S25 and A15 cell lines (data not shown).Figure 2The serine-rich and acidic domains of the IL-2Rβ chain are required for activation of p38 and p54 MAP kinases by IL-2. F7, S25, and A15 cells were stimulated with IL-2 (20 ng/ml) or IL-3 (5% WEHI supernatant) or were left untreated (Un). MAP kinase activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” as follows. A, Western blotting. The top panels show activation of p42/44 MAP kinase determined by Western blotting using a phosphospecific antibody, and the second set of panels show the same blots reprobed for total p42/44 MAP kinase to demonstrate equal protein loading. The third set of panels show p38 MAP kinase phosphospecific Western blots, and the bottom panels show the same blots reprobed for total p38 MAP kinase. p54 MAP kinase phosphorylation could not be detected using a phosphospecific anti-stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase antibody in these cells. B, kinase assays. Immunoprecipitated p38 MAP kinase activity was determined using His6-MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 as a substrate. Immunoprecipitated p54 MAP kinase activity was determined using GST-ATF2 as a substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This similarity in the β-chain subdomain requirements led us to examine whether, as for the activation of p42 MAP kinase, Shc is involved in the activation of p38 and p54 MAP kinases. A second panel of BA/F3 clones expressing mutant forms of the IL-2Rβ chain was used (Fig. 1B). In the cell line Δ355, a truncation of the β-chain at amino acid 355 removes the proline-rich region and part of the acidic region to eliminate all of the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues except the Tyr338 residue required for Shc binding. IL-2 is nonetheless able to activate both p38 and p54 MAP kinases in this cell line (Fig. 3A). However, in another BA/F3 cell line expressing a full-length IL-2Rβ chain with a point mutation of Tyr338 to phenylalanine (Y338F), IL-2 fails to activate p38 and p54 MAP kinases, as determined by kinase assay and phosphospecific Western blotting (Fig. 3A). Curiously, there is still a very slight residual activation of all three MAP kinases by IL-2 when the Y338F mutation is combined with the Δ355 truncation in the BA/F3 cell line Δ355:Y338F (Fig. 3, A and B). An additional BA/F3 line, Δ325-Shc, bears a version of the IL-2Rβ chain in which the entire acidic and proline-rich regions, including all cytoplasmic tyrosines of IL-2Rβ, are replaced with a covalently tethered Shc molecule to specifically reconstitute Shc-mediated signals, as described previously (42Lord J.D. McIntosh B.C. Greenberg P.D. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4627-4633PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2 promoted p38 and p54 MAP kinase activation in these Δ325-Shc cells, suggesting that Shc may mediate the activation of p38 and p54 MAP kinases by IL-2 (Fig. 3A). However, the presence of the receptor fusion protein appears to compromise the ability of IL-3 to activate p38 and p54 MAP kinases. This may indicate that the activation of these kinases by IL-3 also occurs through Shc if the IL-2Rβ-Shc fusion protein is somehow inhibiting a functional interaction between endogenous Shc and the IL-3 receptor. Fig. 3B shows p42 MAP kinase Western blots, confirming the role of the IL-2Rβ chain tyrosine Tyr338 and Shc in p42 MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation. The observation that the IL-2Rβ chain acidic region is dispensable for IL-2-driven proliferation but that both the acidic and the serine-rich regions must be present for p38 and p54 MAP kinase activation in BA/F3 cells indicates that neither kinase is required for proliferation. This conflicts with our previous suggestion (40Crawley J.B. Rawlinson L. Lali F.V. Page T.H. Saklatvala J. Foxwell B.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15023-15027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), based on studies using the p38 inhibitor SB203580, that p38 MAP kinase activation is required for IL-2-driven T cell proliferation. We therefore examined whether proliferation of the IL-2-responsive BA/F3 cell lines was also sensitive to this drug. Of the cell lines used, only two did not proliferate in response to IL-2: the S25 cell line, lacking the entire serine-rich region (4Hatakeyama M. Mori H. Doi T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 59: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and the Δ355:Y338F cell line, in which the IL-2Rβ chain lacks all three of the tyrosine residues of which at least one is required for proliferation (5Friedmann M.C. Migone T.S. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2077-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 42Lord J.D. McIntosh B.C. Greenberg P.D. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4627-4633PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of the cell line F7, A15, or Y338F with SB203580 (0.1–30 μm) resulted in the inhibition of IL-2-driven DNA synthesis with an IC50 of ∼2–6 μm (Fig. 4). Proliferation of the other cell lines was similarly inhibited in each case (data not shown). The IC50 of SB203580 on IL-2-driven proliferation observed in these cell lines was comparable with that observed previously in T cells (40Crawley J.B. Rawlinson L. Lali F.V. Page T.H. Saklatvala J. Foxwell B.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15023-15027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, since no activation of MAP kinases could be detected in either the A15 or the Y338F cells, in these cell lines the effect of SB203580 on proliferation could not be due to the inhibition of p38 MAP kinase and must instead reflect an effect of SB203580 on an unknown target. It is possible that the discrepancy between the data presented here and our previous studies is due to cell type differences in IL-2 signaling between the CT6 T cell line used previously and the pro-B, BA/F3 cell lines used here. In order to address this possibility, we have made use of a second synthetic inhibitor. CNI-1493, a tetravalent guanylhydrazone compound, has bee"

Structurally, and usually functionally, related RTKs are grouped into distinct subfamilies largely on the basis of characteristic combinations of protein motifs in their ligand-binding extracellular domains. Unique in this classification system is the RYK (for related to tyrosine kinase) receptor subfamily which, aside from two leucine-rich motifs in the mammalian orthologues and a possible protease cleavage site common to all RYKs, is comprised of members devoid of recognizable protein modules in their extracellular domains characteristic of other RTKs (2Hovens C.M.

Genet. & Dev. 1997; 7: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have been recognized as physiologically significant modes of signal generation. Twelve conserved peptide sequence motifs, or subdomains, are the signature of the PTK catalytic domain, including some 13 invariant residues, which participate in the phosphotransfer reaction (10Hanks S.K.

P. Do, A. C. Oates, and A. F. Wilks, manuscript in preparation.Although largely functionally uncharacterized, transmembrane proteins such as RYK which bear an apparently catalytically inactive PTK domain may well modulate or relay growth-regulatory cues present in the extracellular environment to cytoplasmic signaling and/or effector molecules. For instance, inactivation of the PTK activity of the Caenorhabditis elegans Eph receptor VAB-1 results in weak mutant phenotypes (relative to extracellular domain mutations), suggesting that a subset of RTKs may execute kinase-independent functions (17George S.E. Simokat K. Hardin J. Chisholm A.D. Cell. 1998; 92: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). These may include recruitment of heterologous protein kinase-competent receptor subunits, as in the case of a kinase-defective EGFR mutant still capable of activating mitogen-activated protein kinase (18Wright J.D. Reuter C.W. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12085-12093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). That mice homozygous for a deletion of exons encoding the PTK domain of VEGFR1 (Flt-1), an RTK essential for embryonic angiogenesis, exhibit normal vessel development and are fully viable suggests that the primary biological role of this receptor is in ligand binding rather than signal transduction (19Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar).Identification of derailed in a P element enhancer trap screen for fasciculating neurons demonstrated a requirement for growth cone pathfinding cues transduced by this RYK subfamily member duringDrosophila nervous system development (4Callahan C.A. Muralidhar M.G. Lundgren S.E. Scully A.L. Thomas J.B. Nature. 1995; 376: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, defective somatic muscle insertion site selection into the epidermis ofderailed mutants suggests that the mechanism for muscle insertion target recognition is biochemically similar to that used in axon pathfinding (20Callahan C.A. Bonkovsky J.L. Scully A.L. Thomas J.B. Development. 1996; 122: 2761-2767PubMed Google Scholar). A pleiotropic role for ERBB3 in cardiac and central nervous system development has been demonstrated inErbB3-null mice (21Riethmacher D. Sonnenberg-Riethmacher E. Brinkmann V. Yamaai T. Lewin G.R.

Development. 1997; 124: 4999-5011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a role for other PTK-inactive RTKs in growth regulation remains to be demonstrated.Here we report the structure of the mouse Ryk transcription unit, including the likely location of its promoter, as identified by an unmethylated CpG island. The unusual organization of domains in the mouse RYK protein extends to the genomic structure that displays features unique within the RTK/growth factor receptor gene family. Southern blotting results suggestive of the existence of a retroprocessed mouse Ryk pseudogene are also presented. Immunohistochemical analysis has been undertaken to define the spatial distribution of RYK expression within individual adult mouse organs. Conserved structural elements that define the RYK subfamily are identified in five metazoan proteins, including one from C. elegans, indicating an early evolutionary origin of these RTK-like molecules. Consistent with subsequent duplications of the ancestral vertebrate genome, the mouse, human, and zebrafish genomes also contain putative Ryk subfamily paralogues that we find to be phylogenetically conserved molecules with likely roles in cellular growth regulation.DISCUSSIONWe have determined in detail the genomic organization of the mouse member of the growing subfamily of growth factor receptorsrelated to tyrosine kinases (Ryk). Although all subfamily members are currently orphan receptors, RYK molecules are expected to function in the transduction of growth-regulatory information across the plasma membrane by virtue of their prototypical RTK topology, as has been demonstrated for all other RTK subfamilies (5Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar).The mouse Ryk transcription unit resides on chromosome 9 (39Kelman Z. Simon-Chazottes D. Guenet J.L. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 37-44PubMed Google Scholar, 50Gough N.M. Rakar S. Hovens C.M. Wilks A.F. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and spans a minimum of 81 kb of genomic DNA. A large first intron is a feature of the mouse Ryk gene which is shared with zebrafish ryk and Drosophila derailed (4Callahan C.A. Muralidhar M.G. Lundgren S.E. Scully A.L. Thomas J.B. Nature. 1995; 376: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A comparison of mouse Ryk with the structures of other mammalian RTK genes shows that a large first intron is not uncommon (e.g. human INSR, >25 kb, Ref. 34Seino S. Seino M. Nishi S. Bell G.I. Proc.

Oncogene. 1998; 16: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The GXGXXG motif vital for ATP binding in PTKs is modified to XXGXXG in the RYK subfamily. This motif is invariably encoded by a single exon; however, in the mouse and C. elegans Ryk genes a type I splice donor site interrupts the codon for the second consensus glycine residue, and a type O splice site separates the fourth and fifth residues of motif I in the zebrafish ryk gene (data not shown). Other mouse RYK PTK subdomains, with the exception of IX, are encoded by single exons, as is usually the case for other RTK genes. This supports the view that the RYK kinase-like domains from phylogenetically diverse species are evolutionarily related.We speculate that the significance of exon splitting of RYK subdomains I and IX, together with unusual kinase subdomain sequences, may be that the ancestral Ryk gene arose very early in metozoan evolution and has since been subjected to selective pressure to maintain a modified PTK activity that relies heavily on atypical residues at normally conserved positions. Molecular modeling of the mouse RYK PTK domain indicates that the nucleotide-binding cleft is particularly large and may therefore indicate a preference for a phosphodonor substrate other than ATP. 5H. Treutlein, M. M. Halford, and S. A. Stacker, unpublished data. This prediction is currently being tested.Primer extension analysis performed by Yee et al. (40Yee K. Bishop T.R. Mather C. Zon L.I.

This result is consistent with the finding that almost every widely expressed gene transcribed by RNA polymerase II that has been examined, such as mouse Ryk, has a CpG island at the 5′ end that includes the transcription start site (Refs. 31Gardiner-Garden M.

Assignment of the transcription start site leads us to predict the synthesis of two mouseRyk mRNA species of 2.3 and 2.6 kb.

By using RT-PCR, we can find no evidence for alternative splicing of the Ryk primary transcript in 3T3 L1 cells. 7M. M. Halford and S. A. Stacker, unpublished data. Wide variation in the reported lengths of mouse Ryk transcripts could be due to the inconsistent use of RNA size standards (i.e. RNA laddersversus 28 S and 18 S rRNA species) in different laboratories. The most accurate sizing of Ryk transcripts seems to have been reported by Maminta et al. (61Maminta M.L.D. Williams K.L. Nakagawara A. Enger K.T. Guo C. Brodeur G.M. Deuel T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), where an RNA ladder has been used to estimate mRNA lengths of 2.1 and 2.6 kb. These correspond well with Ryk mRNA sizes predicted here by identification of the transcription start site and alternative polyadenylation sites. However, the possibility that extensive and stable secondary structure in the G + C-rich 5′ end of the Ryk mRNA, which survives denaturing conditions to variable extents according to the particular methods employed by different laboratories, remains an alternative explanation for the apparent distortion of transcript lengths relative to RNA standards.The G + C-rich nature of the 5′ end of the mouse RykmRNA is a common characteristic of transcripts encoding growth-regulatory proteins. The likely mRNA secondary structure has been proposed to function in the attenuation of translation as an extra level of gene regulation (62Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). This region of the Ryk gene is also highly enriched for the CpG dinucleotide relative to the bulk mammalian genome, where CpG depletion to 20% of the frequency expected from base composition has resulted from methylation of CpG and the high mutability of 5MeCpG to TpG or CpA (CpG suppression; Refs.48Bird A.P.

CpG dinucleotides in the Ryk promoter are protected from genomic DNA methylation and are present at the frequency predicted by base composition alone (i.e. no CpG suppression). These properties identify the sequence spanning exon 1 of the mouse Ryk gene as a CpG island 859 bp in size (Fig. 3).A transcriptionally active CpG island represents a domain of “open” chromatin structure characterized by core histone underacetylation, histone H1 depletion, and a nucleosome-free region (63Tazi J. Bird A. Cell. 1990; 60: 909-920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Constitutive binding of transcription factors is essential for the maintenance of a methylation-free CpG island (46Macleod D. Charlton J. Mullins J. Bird A.P.

Nature. 1994; 371: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Virtually all sequenced genes with widespread expression patterns are associated with a CpG island (Ref. 44Larsen F.

The humanRYK gene is likely to be marked by a CpG island given that approximately 80% of islands are common to mouse and man (65Antequera F. Bird A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whereas Northern blot and RNase protection assays of Ryk mRNA indicate near ubiquitous expression (2Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Andres A. Harpur A.G. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The immunohistochemical staining results presented here confirm localization of the functional Ryk gene product to the tubular epithelium in kidney and to the stromal compartment of the large intestine and indicate that mouse RYK is localized to the stroma and epithelium of villi in the small intestine. However, organs including embryonic day 14 heart and adult liver show strong and homogenous expression of RYK throughout. Furthermore, the spatially restricted localization of mouse RYK to distinct parenchymal compartments of organs such as the adrenal gland and spleen suggests that specific differentiated cell types not related in embryonic origin may require the signal transduced by RYK.We have demonstrated the existence of multiple Ryk subfamily members in the mouse genome by Southern blotting: the canonicalRyk (2Hovens C.M. Stacker S.A. Andres A. Harpur A.G. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11818-11822Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a likely partial retroprocessed pseudogene derived from Ryk kinase domain exons, and a Ryk-related gene detectable at quantitatively reduced stringency usingRyk cDNA-derived probes to the extracellular and PTK domains. The human genome appears to share with the mouse the feature of a Ryk pseudogene, as well as the Ryk-related gene. We have detected Ryk subfamily-like sequences in the genomes of mammals, chicken, fish, and Drosophila by reduced stringency Southern blotting and in a nematode worm by cDNA amplification and sequencing. Although the stringency conditions used for Southern blot hybridization were relaxed, more stringent and extensive washing was performed, suggesting that the level of cross-species nucleotide sequence conservation in the kinase-like domain is high.Southern blot analysis of the Danio rerio (zebrafish) genome showed hybridization signals representing the ryk locus plus a related sequence of unknown identity. From the simple nematode wormC. elegans, we have sequenced a Ryk cDNA orthologue, Ceryk, which predicts a transmembrane protein demonstrating structural conservation of RYK subfamily-specific features. These include a compact extracellular domain containing a putative basic protease cleavage site flanked by universally conserved cysteine residues.

In the predicted CeRYK protein, a protein tyrosine kinase-like domain with strongest sequence homology to other RYKs, distinctive RYK-specific amino acid substitutions in PTK subdomains I and VII (11Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), and a C- terminus conforming to the consensus -Y(V/I)-COOH, representing a possible PDZ domain ligand (74Songyang Z.

Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), are identifiable in the intracellular domain (Fig. 6). No likely candidate C. elegans mutant phenotypes mapping to this CELC16B8 chromosomal locus are known.The RYK proteins are structurally unique in at least two significant features. Few recognizable protein motifs are present in an unusually short extracellular domain, and phylogenetically conserved intracellular substitutions in at least two highly conserved PTK sequence elements responsible for cooperatively binding the Mg2+-ATP phosphate donor complex at the active site may abrogate, or more likely modify, catalytic activity. These changes perhaps reflect involvement of RYK in a unique cell-surface signal transduction complex, where it may interact with a novel family of extracellular ligands and/or be recruited into a heterodimeric PTK-competent receptor complex. Alternatively, RYK could conceivably function to attenuate signaling from such a complex by failing to transactivate the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the partner receptor in competition with homodimeric receptor formation. Third, atypical substrate contacts mediated by the nucleotide binding cleft of RYK subfamily proteins, comprising variant Hanks' motifs I and VII, may indicate an altered specificity for the phosphate, sugar, and/or divalent cation moieties of the phosphodonor complex, as proposed by Kelman et al. (39Kelman Z. Simon-Chazottes D. Guenet J.L. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 37-44PubMed Google Scholar). We are further investigating the function of RYK in embryonic and early postnatal development, and its potential role in cancer, through the generation and analysis ofRyk-deficient mice and a screen for ligands of the RYK receptor.

One feature of developing atherosclerotic plaques is accumulation of cholesterol in plaque monocyte-macrophages. Epidemiological studies have linked the development of atherosclerotic plaques with levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL), 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; SCC, surface-connected compartments; apoB, apolipoprotein B the major carrier of plasma cholesterol. Evidence suggests that macrophage cholesterol originates in part from circulating LDL that enters the blood vessel wall. However, native LDL itself fails to induce cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. Because of this finding, it has been surmised that LDL must undergo changes that increase its uptake by macrophages. Modifications to LDL that aggregate the LDL also promote LDL accumulation by macrophages (1Hoff H.F. O'Neil J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1209-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kawabe Y.

Recently, we showed that LDL aggregated through vortexing or treatment with phospholipase C caused its uptake by a unique endocytic pathway in monocyte-macrophages (9Zhang W.Y. Gaynor P.M. Kruth H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31700-31706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These aggregated LDLs induced and entered a labyrinth of surface-connected membrane bound compartments (SCC) within the macrophage. Because this endocytosis pathway results in uptake and storage of material within compartments that remain open to the extracellular space, we have named this endocytic process “patocytosis” from the Latin, patere, meaning to lie open. LDL entry into SCC does not depend on the LDL receptor. Aggregated LDL that enters SCC is mostly stored rather than degraded. Unesterified cholesterol-rich liposomes are a prominent component of lesion lipid (10Chao F.F. Amende L.M. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Skarlatos S.I. Gamble W. Resau J.H. Mergner W.T. Kruth H.S. Am. J.

These unique cholesterol-rich particles are found in early developing atherosclerotic lesions and their appearance precedes foam cell development within lesions (14Simionescu N. Vasile E. Lupu F. Popescu G. Simionescu M. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 123: 109-125PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kruth H.S. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 57: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 16Chao F.F. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dickens B.F. Gamble W. Kruth H.S. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 71-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that treatment of LDL with cholesterol esterase converts the 0.02-μm LDL particles into ≅0.1-μm liposomes (17Chao F.F. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Tertov V.V. Skarlatos S.I. Chen Y.J. Kruth H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4992-4998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL-derived liposomes are similar in size and chemical composition to liposomes found in atherosclerotic lesions. Both LDL-derived liposomes and lesion liposomes show a high molar ratio of unesterified cholesterol to phospholipid (>2:1) and a high percentage (>75%) of their cholesterol is unesterified. Like aggregation of LDL, conversion of LDL into liposomes potentially exposes lipid and protein domains normally hidden in native LDL. We now report that cholesterol esterase mediated conversion of LDL into liposomes is an LDL modification that stimulates patocytosis and foam cell formation. Human LDL prepared with density gradient centrifugation was obtained from PerImmune (Rockville, MD) (18Havel R. Eder H. Bragdon J. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). LDL-derived liposomes were produced essentially as described previously (17Chao F.F. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Tertov V.V. Skarlatos S.I. Chen Y.J. Kruth H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4992-4998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LDL was sequentially treated with trypsin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and then with cholesterol esterase to hydrolyze the cholesteryl ester core of LDL. Treatment with trypsin was found earlier to be necessary before cholesterol esterase could hydrolyze LDL cholesteryl esters. This treatment converts LDL that normally has about 25% of its cholesterol in unesterified form into unesterified cholesterol-rich liposomes that have >90% of their cholesterol in unesterified form (see Ref. 17Chao F.F.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4992-4998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for the characterization of these LDL liposomes). It should be noted that trypsin treatment of LDL does not eliminate its binding to the LDL receptor (19Carew T.E. Chapman M.J. Goldstein S. Steinberg D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). LDL liposomes were purified by gel filtration as described earlier with the exception that the elution buffer was Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% disodium EDTA. The purified LDL liposomes were sterilized by filtration through polysulfone 0.45-μm (pore-size) filters (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) into sterile polypropylene tubes and stored at 4 °C. LDL liposomes were also prepared from lipid extracted from LDL. In this case lipid was extracted from LDL using 2:1 chloroform/methanol as described by Folch et al. (20Folch J. Lees M. Sloan Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. One-ml of buffer containing 0.15m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), and 0.5 mm EDTA was added to the lipid that was then sonicated under nitrogen for 3 h at 51 °C with 50 watts power (Branson Sonifier 250, Danbury, CT). This dispersed the lipid into particles as described previously for preparation of synthetic LDL-sized lipid particles (21Lundberg B. Suominen L. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 550-5508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL liposomes were then prepared from these lipid particles as was described above for native LDL. In one type of experiment purified LDL liposomes (at a cholesterol concentration of 1300 nmol/ml) were further treated 2 h at 37 °C with papain (0.5 mg/ml) followed by leupeptin (0.2 mg/ml for 30 min) (both from Boehringer-Mannheim) to neutralize the papain. These protease-treated LDL liposomes were used to learn whether a protein component of the liposomes was required for macrophage uptake.

Two-week-old monocyte-macrophage cultures were rinsed 3 times with RPMI 1640 medium and incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium with the indicated concentrations of liposomes expressed as nanomole of total cholesterol/ml of medium. Potential inhibitors of liposome uptake that were tested included cytochalasin D, nocodazole, polyinosinic acid (all from Sigma), C7 mouse anti-LDL receptor monoclonal antibody (purified from supernatant of cell line number 1691-CRL, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) (24Beisiegel U. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11923-11931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and isotype-matched control monoclonal IgG2b antibody (catalog number 50330, ICN, Aurora, OH), and receptor-associated protein that inhibits lipoprotein binding to the LDL receptor-related protein (25Strickland D.K.

The role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in LDL liposome uptake was tested by first treating macrophages for 3 h at 37 °C without or with 50 mmchlorate plus 80 units/ml heparinase I (Sigma). Then these macrophages were rinsed and incubated 1 day with either 200 nmol/ml LDL liposomes or 100 μg/ml rabbit β-very low density lipoprotein without or with 50 mm chlorate (26Seo T. St. Clair R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 765-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Greve H. Cully Z. Blumberg P. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12886-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In one experiment, purified apoB (PerImmune) (28Walsh M.T. Atkinson D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3170-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was incubated with monocyte-macrophage cultures. First, the apoB (0.5 mg), which contained detergents, was solubilized in saline. Then the detergents were removed by exhaustive dialysis against saline. The now insoluble apoB was centrifuged, resuspended in RPMI 1640 at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, dispersed by direct sonication (15 s), and then incubated 5 h with monocyte-macrophages to learn whether apoB could stimulate patocytosis. Two other insoluble proteins, collagen IV and fibrin (catalog numbers C5533 and F5386, respectively, obtained from Sigma) were each resuspended directly into RPMI 1640 culture medium at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, sonicated 15 s, and incubated with monocyte-macrophages also at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Following incubations, macrophage cultures were analyzed for their cholesterol contents or for ultrastructural changes as described below. Macrophages were rinsed, harvested, and processed as described previously (29Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unesterified and esterified cholesterol contents of macrophages and LDL liposomes were determined enzymatically according to the fluorometric method of Gamble et al. (30Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mean ± S.E. (when shown) were determined from three culture wells for each data point. Extracellular and intracellular membranes were differentiated with ruthenium red according to the method of Luft (31Luft J.H. Anat. Rec. 1971; 171: 347-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Monocyte-macrophage cultures were ruthenium red-stained and prepared for electron microscopy as described previously (22Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Conversion of LDL into liposomes with cholesterol esterase treatment greatly increased LDL uptake by human monocyte-macrophages. Native LDL did not cause much cholesterol accumulation in macrophages (Table I and Fig. 1a). Only when LDL was converted to liposomes (i.e. was treated with trypsin followed by cholesterol esterase) did LDL induce substantial cholesterol accumulation in the macrophages. With this treatment, the formed LDL liposomes (that contained >90% of their cholesterol in unesterified form) induced a 3–5-fold increase in macrophage cholesterol content. Treatments of LDL with either trypsin or cholesterol esterase alone showed little effect on cholesterol accumulation (Table I).Table IEffect of treating LDL with cholesterol esterase on macrophage cholesterol accumulationConditionCholesteryl ester/total cholesterol in LDLMacrophage cholesterol contentmol %nmol/mg cell proteinNo addition58 ± 1LDL7365 ± 1LDL + trypsin + STI7270 ± 1LDL + CEase7077 ± 1LDL + trypsin + STI + CEase8177 ± 1Macrophages were incubated 2 days with 200 nmol of cholesterol/ml of LDL treated as indicated. 1.25 mg of LDL in 2.5 ml of 50 mmTris saline buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm Na2EDTA was treated as indicated sequentially (17Chao F.F.

Then, the treated LDL samples were exhaustively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and added directly to macrophage cultures without isolating the treated LDL. Open table in a new tab Macrophages were incubated 2 days with 200 nmol of cholesterol/ml of LDL treated as indicated. 1.25 mg of LDL in 2.5 ml of 50 mmTris saline buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm Na2EDTA was treated as indicated sequentially (17Chao F.F.

Then, the treated LDL samples were exhaustively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and added directly to macrophage cultures without isolating the treated LDL. Macrophage cholesterol accumulation during a 2-day incubation was maximal when macrophages were incubated with LDL liposomes at a concentration of 150–200 nmol of cholesterol/ml (Fig. 1a). During such incubations, macrophage cholesterol accumulation varied but could reach levels more than 400 nmol/mg cell protein with greater than 60% of cholesterol esterified. Incubation of macrophages with LDL liposomes for up to 5 days showed that most of the increase in macrophage cholesterol content occurred during the first 2 days of incubation (Fig. 1b). The lag in total cholesterol accumulation at 1 day occurred in 2 out of 3 time course experiments. Cholesterol was esterified during the entire 5-day incubation. In another experiment not shown, the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor, S58-035, completely blocked esterification of cholesterol during a 3-day incubation of macrophages with LDL liposomes (200 nmol of cholesterol/ml), but did not decrease total cholesterol accumulation. LDL liposomes induced macrophage cholesterol accumulation comparable to the levels induced by acetylated LDL and microcrystalline cholesterol (Table II). The amount of cholesteryl ester synthesized by macrophages incubated with LDL liposomes and microcrystalline cholesterol was similar although more total cholesterol accumulated in macrophages incubated with microcrystalline cholesterol. Different LDL liposome preparations induced similar levels of cholesterol accumulation when incubated with macrophages from the same culture. On the other hand, the degree of cholesterol accumulation varied with different macrophage cultures (see comparable data for the 2-day incubations in Fig. 1, a and b).Table IIMacrophage cholesterol accumulation induced by LDL liposomes compared with other lipid particlesLipid particleUnesterified cholesterolEsterified cholesterolTotal cholesterolnmol/mg cell proteinNone71 ± 34 ± 476 ± 1Acetylated LDL126 ± 6261 ± 12387 ± 18LDL liposomes (preparation 1)132 ± 7188 ± 4320 ± 8LDL liposomes (preparation 2)141 ± 6187 ± 4328 ± 10LDL liposomes (preparation 3)140 ± 5188 ± 13327 ± 16Microcrystalline cholesterol270 ± 18189 ± 4459 ± 21Macrophages were incubated 4 days with 100 μg of protein/ml of acetylated LDL or with 200 or 520 nmol of cholesterol/ml of LDL liposomes and microcrystalline cholesterol, respectively. The 200 nmol/ml of LDL liposome cholesterol was equivalent to about 75 μg/ml of LDL protein. Following incubations, macrophages were rinsed and analyzed for their cholesterol contents. Open table in a new tab Macrophages were incubated 4 days with 100 μg of protein/ml of acetylated LDL or with 200 or 520 nmol of cholesterol/ml of LDL liposomes and microcrystalline cholesterol, respectively. The 200 nmol/ml of LDL liposome cholesterol was equivalent to about 75 μg/ml of LDL protein. Following incubations, macrophages were rinsed and analyzed for their cholesterol contents. Experiments were carried out to determine whether LDL liposomes could induce and enter macrophage SCC as we previously reported occurs with aggregated LDL and microcrystalline cholesterol (22Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Macrophages were incubated with LDL liposomes for 1 day and then processed for electron microscopy with ruthenium red, an electron dense stain that labels cellular membranes. Ruthenium red does not penetrate the plasma membrane of aldehyde-fixed cells. Thus, in aldehyde-fixed cells, ruthenium red stains only cellular membranes that are in continuity with the extracellular space. Fig. 2 shows that LDL liposomes induced and entered macrophage SCC that were ruthenium red stained. Ruthenium red also stained the LDL liposomes contained within the SCC. Many non-membrane bound lipid droplets accumulated in the cytoplasm of macrophages incubated with LDL liposomes reflecting esterification of LDL liposome cholesterol. Like phagocytosis, patocytosis (the SCC endocytic process) is inhibited by cytochalasin D, an agent that disrupts actin microfilaments, but not by nocodazole, an agent that disrupts microtubules. When macrophages were incubated with LDL liposomes in the presence of cytochalasin D, LDL liposomes were observed attached to the plasma membrane but did not enter macrophages and no SCC formed (data not shown). Thus, cytochalasin D blocked uptake of LDL liposomes by macrophages, but not their binding to the macrophage surface. As a result, cytochalasin D decreased but did not eliminate macrophage cholesterol accumulation induced by LDL liposomes (Fig. 3). Some increase in macrophage unesterified cholesterol content apparently occurred due to binding of LDL liposomes to the macrophage plasma membrane. Cytochalasin D decreased unesterified cholesterol accumulation by 26%. However, this inhibitor decreased esterified cholesterol accumulation to a greater extent at 88%, suggesting that uptake into SCC and possibly some additional actin-dependent process (32Tabas I. Zha X. Beatini N. Myers J.N. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22547-22556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was necessary for esterification of LDL liposome cholesterol. The capacity of LDL liposomes to induce cholesterol accumulation depended on its protein component. This was shown by exposing LDL liposomes to the protease, papain, then neutralizing the papain with leupeptin, and finally incubating these protease-treated LDL liposomes with macrophages. Papain treatment of the LDL liposomes significantly decreased macrophage cholesterol accumulation (TableIII). If papain was neutralized with leupeptin before exposing the LDL liposomes to the papain, papain did not effectively decrease macrophage uptake of LDL liposomes. This showed that leupeptin inhibition of papain was sufficient to prevent any substantial effect of the added papain on macrophage receptors involved in uptake of the LDL liposomes. Incubation of macrophages with LDL liposomes prepared from extracted LDL lipid also did not cause any macrophage cholesterol accumulation (data not shown). This further demonstrated the importance of apoB in mediating LDL liposome uptake by macrophages.Table IIIEffect of treating LDL liposomes with protease on macrophage cholesterol accumulationConditionMacrophage cholesterol contentnmol/mg cell proteinNo addition109 ± 7LDL liposomes + buffer (2 h), then leupeptin (30 min)266 ± 5LDL liposomes + papain (2 h), then leupeptin (30 min)157 ± 2LDL liposomes + papain (preincubated with leupeptin 30 min) (2 h)243 ± 2LDL liposomes (1300 nmol of cholesterol/ml) were treated as indicated with 0.5 mg/ml papain and 0.2 mg/ml leupeptin. Then macrophages were incubated 2 days with the treated LDL liposomes (200 nmol of cholesterol/ml). Following incubations, macrophages were rinsed and analyzed for their cholesterol contents. Open table in a new tab LDL liposomes (1300 nmol of cholesterol/ml) were treated as indicated with 0.5 mg/ml papain and 0.2 mg/ml leupeptin. Then macrophages were incubated 2 days with the treated LDL liposomes (200 nmol of cholesterol/ml). Following incubations, macrophages were rinsed and analyzed for their cholesterol contents. The above results suggested that apoB, the major protein component of the LDL liposomes mediated their uptake into macrophage SCC. We directly tested this conclusion by incubating macrophages with purified apoB, a protein that is insoluble in aqueous buffers such as culture medium. Macrophages were incubated with 1 mg/ml insoluble apoB and then examined by electron microscopy for the presence of SCC. ApoB induced SCC in most macrophages and an amorphous ruthenium red-stained material (consistent with apoB protein) accumulated within the SCC (Fig. 4). On the other hand, incubation of macrophages with the same concentration of two other insoluble proteins, collagen and fibrin, did not induce SCC. Uptake of LDL liposome cholesterol did not depend on the LDL receptor. Cholesterol-enrichment of macrophages decreases macrophage expression of the LDL receptor (33Koo C. Wernette-Hammond M.E. Garcia Z. Malloy M.J. Uauy R. East C. Bilheimer D.W. Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1332-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, macrophage cholesterol-enrichment did not decrease cholesterol accumulation induced by LDL liposomes. When macrophages were first incubated with acetylated LDL for 2 days, their cholesterol content doubled (from 80 ± 1 to 160 ± 2 nmol of cholesterol/mg of cell protein) (Table IV). Nevertheless, a subsequent 2-day incubation with LDL liposomes of these and other macrophages that were not cholesterol-enriched produced similar increments in macrophage cholesterol content (167 ± 4 and 170 ± 7 nmol of cholesterol/mg of cell protein, respectively). Additional findings indicated that LDL receptors were not involved in LDL liposome uptake. Incubation of LDL liposomes (200 nmol/ml) with macrophages for 2 days in the presence of 100 μg/ml of an anti-LDL receptor monoclonal antibody (C7) (24Beisiegel U. Schneider W.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11923-11931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did not decrease macrophage cholesterol accumulation. Also, methylation of apoB, which blocks apoB binding to macrophage LDL receptors (34Shechter I. Fogelman A.M. Haberland M.E. Seager J. Hokom M. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not interfere with apoBs capacity to induce and enter macrophage SCC.Table IVEffect of macrophage cholesterol enrichment on subsequent LDL liposome-induced macrophage cholesterol accumulationConditionUnesterified cholesterolEsterified cholesterolTotal cholesterolnmol/mg cell protein0 days80 ± 11 ± 080 ± 1AcLDL, 2 days88 ± 272 ± 2160 ± 2AcLDL, 2 days; RPMI, 2 days73 ± 265 ± 5138 ± 4AcLDL, 2 days; LDL liposomes, 2 days199 ± 4128 ± 8327 ± 5RPMI, 2 days52 ± 20 ± 152 ± 1RPMI, 2 days; LDL liposomes, 2 days157 ± 565 ± 1222 ± 6Macrophages were incubated without or with acetylated LDL (AcLDL) (50 μg of protein/ml) for 2 days to cholesterol-enrich the macrophages.

Following this incubation, macrophages were analyzed for their cholesterol contents. Open table in a new tab Macrophages were incubated without or with acetylated LDL (AcLDL) (50 μg of protein/ml) for 2 days to cholesterol-enrich the macrophages. Then, the macrophages were rinsed and incubated without and with liposomes (200 nmol of cholesterol/ml) for 2 days. Following this incubation, macrophages were analyzed for their cholesterol contents. Other potential lipoprotein receptors also did not mediate macrophage uptake of LDL liposomes. Polyinosinic acid (2.5 mg/ml), a scavenger receptor inhibitor (35Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar) failed to inhibit LDL liposome-induced macrophage cholesterol accumulation. However, polyinosinic acid did inhibit by >90% acetylated LDL-induced macrophage cholesterol accumulation (both the LDL liposomes and acetylated LDL were incubated with macrophages for 2 days at a total cholesterol concentration of 200 nmol/ml). Receptor-associated protein (1 μm), an inhibitor of LDL receptor-related protein and other LDL receptor family members (25Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), showed no effect on LDL liposome-induced macrophage cholesterol accumulation. Macrophage uptake of LDL liposomes may not depend on a macrophage cell-surface protein. Exposure of macrophages to trypsin (20 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C) followed by soybean trypsin inhibitor (30 μg/ml for 30 min) actually increased macrophage cholesterol accumulation during a 1-day incubation with LDL liposomes (200 nmol of cholesterol/ml) and cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) added to block protein synthesis (165 ± 3 nmol/mg cell protein for sham-treated macrophages and LDL liposomes without cycloheximide compared with 211 ± 11 nmol/mg cell protein for trypsin-treated macrophages and LDL liposomes plus cycloheximide). On the other hand, as expected for a protein receptor-mediated uptake process, trypsin alone, cycloheximide alone, and trypsin plus cycloheximide treatments significantly decreased acetyl-LDL-induced (100 μg/ml) macrophage cholesterol accumulation (140 ± 1 with sham treatments, 132 ± 2 with trypsin alone, 121 ± 5 with cycloheximide alone, and 114 ± 4 nmol cholesterol/mg cell protein with combined trypsin and cycloheximide treatments). Macrophage uptake of apoB-containing lipoproteins in some instances can be mediated by cell surface proteoglycans (26Seo T. St. Clair R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 765-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Obunike J.C. Edwards I.J. Rumsey S.C. Curtiss L.K. Wagner W.D. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol.

However, digestion of macrophages with heparinase I (80 units/ml, Sigma) followed by incubation of macrophages for 1 day with LDL liposomes (200 nmol/ml) in the presence of 50 mm chlorate (an inhibitor of proteoglycan sulfation (27Greve H. Cully Z. Blumberg P. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12886-12892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) failed to reduce macrophage cholesterol accumulation. On the other hand, as recently reported for pigeon peritoneal macrophages (26Seo T. St. Clair R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 765-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), heparinase I treatment did decrease by 70% macrophage cholesterol accumulation induced by rabbit β-very low density lipoprotein (100 μg of protein/ml) in the same experiment. Previously we showed that microcrystalline cholesterol and aggregated LDL enter SCC that form in human monocyte-macrophages during incubation with these lipid particles (22Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Ifrim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Uptake of the lipid particles into SCC is an actin-dependent process we call patocytosis. Patocytosis is distinct from phagocytosis in which vacuoles pinch off from the plasma membrane. We now show that liposomes derived from cholesterol esterase-treated LDL also are accumulated by macrophages through patocytosis. Uptake of LDL liposomes was predominantly mediated by the apoB component rather than the lipid component of the LDL liposomes. This was indicated by the findings that: 1) protease treatment of the LDL liposomes decreased most macrophage cholesterol accumulation; 2) LDL liposomes prepared from LDL lipid extracts caused no macrophage cholesterol accumulation; and 3) purified apoB could induce and enter macrophage SCC. Sufficient hydrolysis of LDL cholesteryl ester may be important for the conversion of LDL into a lipid particle that can cause macrophage cholesterol accumulation. In two previous studies, it was reported that cholesterol esterase treatment of LDL did not increase and even decreased LDL uptake by macrophages. In one of these studies (39Bhakdi S. Dorweiler B. Kirchmann R. Torzewski J. Weise E. Tranum-Jensen J. Walev I. Wieland E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1959-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), LDL was treated with cholesterol esterase in the presence of trypsin rather than first treating LDL with trypsin and then neutralizing the trypsin with a trypsin inhibitor as in our study. In this earlier study, it is likely that there was little or no hydrolysis of LDL cholesteryl ester due to trypsin-mediated degradation of any added cholesterol esterase. While the LDL cholesteryl ester content was not monitored in this earlier study, electron microscopy showed that trypsin and cholesterol esterase treatment of LDL did not produce liposomes. This suggests that LDL cholesteryl ester hydrolysis was minimal. In the other study (40Aviram M. Keidar S. Rosenblat M. Brook G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11567-11574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only about 33% of LDL cholesteryl ester was hydrolyzed in contrast to the almost complete hydrolysis of LDL cholesteryl ester in our study. It is likely that the low level of cholesteryl ester hydrolysis in both these earlier studies was not sufficient to form liposomes from the LDL, and thus possibly not sufficient to permit macrophage binding of cryptic apoB domains or to create larger liposomal lipid particles with multiple copies of apoB (discussed below). Because of the greater size of LDL liposomes compared with native LDL, more than one LDL particle should contribute to each LDL liposome. Thus, even if not greatly aggregated, LDL liposomes (like aggregated LDL) should be multivalent with respect to apoB, whereas LDL is known to have only one copy of apoB per LDL particle (41Wiklund O. Dyer C.A. Tsao B.P. Curtiss L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10956-10960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A lipid particle with a multivalent apoB ligand may have the capacity to initiate receptor cross-linking and cell signaling pathways that could trigger uptake into SCC. ApoB is unique among the apolipoproteins in that it is very hydrophobic, a property that accounts for its insolubility in aqueous buffer. In this regard, we have not observed SCC when macrophages were incubated, for example, with apoE, 2H. S. Kruth and W-Y. Zhang, unpublished data. a soluble apolipoprotein that mediates LDL receptor uptake of β-very low density lipoprotein into surface-connected tubules of mouse peritoneal macrophages (42Myers J.N. Tabas I. Jones N.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 43Tabas I. Myers J.N. Innerarity T.L. Xu X.X. Arnold K. Boyles J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The other lipid particle that we find enters SCC is microcrystalline cholesterol, another hydrophobic material. Studies are in progress to learn whether hydrophobicity is a requirement for stimulation of the SCC endocytic pathway. Whatever apoB characteristics are required to stimulate the SCC pathway, uptake did not occur through apoB-mediated binding of LDL liposomes to LDL, LDL receptor-related protein, or polyinosinic acid-inhibitable scavenger receptors. This was shown by a lack of inhibition by C7 monoclonal antibody, receptor-associated protein, and polyinosinic acid, respectively. Also, uptake of LDL liposome cholesterol was not down-regulated by cholesterol enrichment of the macrophages, previously shown to down-regulate LDL receptors in human monocyte-macrophages (33Koo C. Wernette-Hammond M.E. Garcia Z. Malloy M.J. Uauy R. East C. Bilheimer D.W. Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1332-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Exposure of macrophages to enzymes that digest proteins or proteoglycans did not decrease LDL liposome uptake, suggesting that LDL liposome uptake was mediated by some other type of molecule. Cholesterol-rich liposomes accumulate in the extracellular spaces of atherosclerotic plaques often surrounding macrophage foam cells and are present within membranous compartments of these macrophages (44Kruth H.S. Subcell. Biochem. 1997; 28: 319-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that monocyte-macrophages secrete bile salt-stimulated cholesterol esterase under certain conditions and that a similar enzyme is present within human aorta (45Li F. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28666-28671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 46Shamir R. Johnson W.J. Morlock-Fitzpatrick K. Zolfaghari R. Li L. Mas E. Lombardo D. Morel D.W. Fisher E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that LDL liposomes form from LDL in atherosclerotic plaques and contribute to macrophage cholesterol accumulation in these plaques. In conclusion, conversion of LDL to cholesterol-rich liposomes produces a lipid particle that is taken up by human monocyte-macrophages converting them into foam cells (greater than 60% of the cholesterol in these macrophages was esterified). Like aggregated LDL, the LDL liposomes entered macrophages by a non-LDL receptor pathway that caused accumulation of the lipid particles in macrophage SCC. The major component of LDL, apoB, mediated uptake of the LDL liposomes, and could by itself induce and enter macrophage SCC. It remains controversial whether uptake of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol by macrophages in atherosclerosic plaques causes the accumulation of this cholesterol within plaques, or whether uptake of this lipid is secondary and represents a macrophage function to remove this lipid from the plaques (44Kruth H.S. Subcell. Biochem. 1997; 28: 319-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In any case, learning that apoB can direct entry of LDL-derived liposomes and possibly other forms of modified LDL into SCC is important to our understanding of macrophage function in atherogenesis.

To define signaling pathways activated by the env-sea protein, we looked for protein-protein interactions mediated by these tyrosine residues. We show that the bidentate motif is responsible for interaction with the adapter protein Grb2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. Furthermore, we show that microinjected Src homology 2 domains from either Grb2 or SHP-2 blocked the transforming activity of the env-sea protein. Together, these results suggest that the tyrosines within the bidentate motif are essential for the env-sea transformation. A large number of oncogenes encode altered forms of growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinases (1Bishop J.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 235-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar, 2Hunter T.

The activation of RTKs triggers autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues, which then serve as specific binding sites for cellular signaling proteins containing Src-homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding domains (7Koch C.A.

Individual SH2 domains recognize specific phosphotyrosine residues flanked by distinct sequences (10Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S.

Signal transduction by RTKs involves activation of multiple pathways following association with different cellular target proteins. The env-sea oncogene is derived from a cellular protein-tyrosine kinase, c-sea, the extracellular and transmembrane domains of which have been replaced by viral envelope sequences (11Smith D.R. Vogt P.K. Hayman M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Due to the fusion with viral envelope domain, the env-sea protein has a structure similar to RTKs (12Hayman M.J. Kitchener G. Vogt P.K. Beug H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8237-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the env-sea tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for transformation by the env-sea protein (13Knight J. Zenke M. Disela C. Kowenz E. Vogt P. Engel J.D. Hayman M.J. Beug H. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and that cell surface localization, oligomerization by viral envelope domains, and autophosphorylation are all necessary for the transforming activity of the env-sea protein (14Crowe A.J. Hayman M.J. a Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 403-410PubMed Google Scholar, 15Crowe A.J. Hayman M.J. b Oncogene. 1993; 8: 181-189PubMed Google Scholar, 16Morimoto A.M. Hayman M.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1837-1842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using a temperature-sensitive mutant, previous work demonstrated that the phosphorylation of the Shc proteins correlated with the activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the env-sea protein (17Crowe A.J. McGlade J. Pawson T. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 537-544PubMed Google Scholar). However, Shc did not form a stable complex with the env-sea protein. In contrast, the Grb2 protein did associate with the env-sea protein (17Crowe A.J. McGlade J. Pawson T. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 537-544PubMed Google Scholar). To date, no other proteins have been demonstrated to be involved in env-sea signaling. The env-sea protein is a member of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor subfamily. All members of this family have a bidentate motif, comprising two tandemly arranged SH2 domain binding sites at the carboxyl terminus (18Huff J.L. Jelinek M.A. Borgman C.A. Lansing T.J. Parsons J.T.

Panayotou G. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). In the Met protein, it has been demonstrated that the tyrosine closest to the carboxyl terminus within this motif, tyrosine 1356, plays a major role in signaling by this receptor (22Fixman E.D. Naujokas M.A. Rodrigues G.A. Moran M.F. Park M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 237-249PubMed Google Scholar,23Ponzetto C. Zhen Z. Audero E. Maina F. Bardelli A. Basile M.L. Giordano S. Narsimhan R. Comoglio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14119-14123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although this motif is conserved in Sea, the sequences surrounding the tyrosine are quite different from those in Met. In particular, env-sea has two potential Grb2 binding sites, whereas Met has only one, and Grb2 binding has been shown to play a major role in Met signaling (24Fixman E.D. Holgado-Madruga M.

However, there is no information on the role of this motif in signaling by env-sea, nor is there any knowledge of substrates that can bind to this motif. Hence, we have undertaken a structure-function analysis to address the role of this motif in signaling by env-sea. We constructed mutants in which these tyrosines are changed to phenylalanine residues. In this report, we show that the conserved bidentate motif is essential for the transformation of Rat1 cells by the env-sea protein. However, in contrast to Met, substitution of each tyrosine alone either had no effect on transformation or actually enhanced transformation. To study downstream signaling pathways mediated by the tyrosine residues in the motif, we looked for protein-protein interactions at this site. Our data indicate that Grb2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase), and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 can all bind to this motif, but there was no simple correlation between association of these proteins and transformation. All reagents, unless specified, were purchased from Sigma. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. S13 Rat1 cells are Rat1 fibroblasts expressing a temperature-sensitive env-sea protein (11Smith D.R. Vogt P.K. Hayman M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). S13 Rat1 cells were grown at 35 and 39.5 °C with 7% CO2. Rat1 and COS1 cells were grown at 37 °C with 7% CO2. The sea-specific antibody was generated against the PstI toClaI fragment of the env-sea gene and was characterized previously (26Knight J. Smith D.R. Hayman M.J. Virology. 1990; 178: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Anti-Shc antibody directed against the SH2 domain was provided by Dr. Pawson. Anti-SHP-2 antibody was a gift from Dr. Kazlauskas. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes the M45 epitope tag was kindly provided by Dr. Hearing. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and anti-MAP kinase antibody were gifts from Dr. Morrison and Dr. Davis, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies against Grb2 and SHP-2 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The polyclonal antibodies against Grb2 and glutathioneS-transferase (GST) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the antibody against PI3 kinase was from Upstate Biotechnology. Cloning of the full-length env-sea gene (pS13–1) was reported previously (11Smith D.R. Vogt P.K. Hayman M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To generate tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions at the carboxyl-terminal end, the site-directed mutagenesis method of overlap extension (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6770) Google Scholar) was used.SacI and ClaI fragment (amino acids 1161–2091) containing the bidentate motif was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). For the Y557F mutant, the sense primer was 5′-ggtgagcacttcatcaacatggc-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-gccatgttgatgaagtgctcacc-3′. For the Y564F mutant, the sense primer was 5′-gctgtcaccttcgtcaacctggag-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-ctccaggttgacgaaggtgacagc-3′. For the Y557F/Y564F mutant, the sense primer was 5′-ggtgagcacttcatcaacatggctgtcaccttcgtcaacc-3′, and the antisense primer was the same as for the Y564F mutant. Primary polymerase chain reaction was done with the sense and T7 primers and also with the antisense and T3 primers. Primary polymerase chain reaction products were used for overlap extension with T3 and T7 primers. Final products were purified, digested with SacI and ClaI, and then subcloned into pS13-1. The entire env-sea sequence containing the point mutations was digested withXbaI and KpnI and subcloned into an expression vector, pMT2, at the EcoRI site. To generate the M45 epitope tag inside the env-sea protein, the sense primer 5′-tcgaggatcggagtagggatcgcctacctccttttgagacagagacgcggatcc-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-tcgaggatccgcgtctctgtctcaaaaggaggtaggcgatccctactccgatcc-3′ were generated. Oligomers were annealed and ligated into pS13-1 at the XhoI site in the amino-terminal envelope sequence. The correct orientation was confirmed by sequencing. To generate Rat1 cell lines overexpressing the env-sea proteins, Rat1 cells were co-transfected with pMT2/M45 env-sea and pRSVneo by the calcium phosphate method as descried by Chen and Okayama (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing G418 (400 μg ml, Life Technologies, Inc.). For transient transfection into COS1 cells, FuGENETM 6 reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) was used according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml, and 10 μg of aprotinin/ml). Lysates were precleared by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay system (Pierce). 300 μg of total cell lysate was incubated with antibodies for 2–3 h at 4 °C, and then 20 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and incubated for an additional 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in the lysis buffer, solubilized by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). For Western blotting, membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for at least 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with indicated antibodies for at least 2 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) Clones of Rat1 cells transfected with the different mutant and wild type forms of the env-sea protein were screened for equivalent levels of expression of the various env-sea proteins. Cells that were identified to express equivalent amounts of env-sea protein were seeded into 0.3% agar (Difco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at a density of 105 or 106 cells per 60-mm plate and then incubated at 35 °C. The cells were fed with soft agar medium at day 5, and colonies were counted on day 10. Bacteria expressing GST-Shc (SH2) were provided by Dr. Pawson. Dr. Bar-Sagi and Dr. Keegan provided bacteria expressing full-length GST-Grb2 and full-length GST-SHP-2. The SH2 domain(s) of each protein was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and subcloned into an expression plasmid, pGEX-KG (29Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Overexpressed GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) dialyzed and concentrated (3 mg/ml) for microinjection. For an in vitrobinding experiment using GST-SHP-2 (SH2s), 600 μg of lysates was incubated with 5 μg of GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C, and then bound proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-M45 antibody. S13 Rat1 cells were plated onto acid-washed coverslips, grown to subconfluent density at 39 °C, and then placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 22–24 h prior to microinjection. GST fusion proteins were microinjected into the cytoplasm. After injection, cells were incubated at 35 or 39 °C for an additional 12–14 h, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min at room temperature. The coverslips were incubated with rabbit anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz) in phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. To visualize cells, the actin cytoskeleton was stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent microscopy was used to analyze the results. The bidentate motif is made up of two tandemly arranged potential SH2 domain binding sites (Y557INMAVTY564VNL). This motif is shown schematically in Fig. 1. To investigate whether tyrosine residues in this motif are essential for the transforming ability of env-sea, we generated point mutants that have phenylalanine for tyrosine substitutions at each site individually (Y557F and Y564F) or at both residues (Y557F/Y564F) in Rat1 cells. In addition, because the sequences carboxyl-terminal of the tyrosine can influence SH2 domain binding, we converted the sequence around Tyr-564 to that of Tyr-557 (Y557/Y557). 2Y557/Y557 indicates a conversion of the motif at Tyr-564 to a copy of that at Tyr-557. To monitor expression, an epitope tag (M45) was generated at the amino-terminal end of the envelope sequence. In Rat1 cells, the env-sea protein is synthesized as a glycosylated protein of 155 kDa (gp155) that undergoes proteolytic processing to generate the proteins gp85 and gp70; thus, anti-M45 antibody can recognize gp155 but not gp70 (Fig. 1). In Fig. 2A, the upper bandsrepresent the mature, glycosylated form of env-sea proteins (gp155), whereas the lower bands represent the immature, unglycosylated precursor proteins. Expression levels for all mutant env-sea proteins were comparable to wild type env-sea protein (Fig. 2A), and for the Y557F/Y564F mutant, they were generally higher than wild type. To see whether any of these mutations affected the autophosphorylation activity of gp70, we performed anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting of immunoprecipitates made with anti-sea antibodies from equivalent amounts of cell lysates. As can be seen, none of these mutations had any major effect on autophosphorylation (Fig. 2B). The level of phosphorylation of the Y557F/Y564F mutant was slightly lower than the other proteins, especially if one considers the higher expression levels seen with this mutant. However, this presumably reflects the loss of two phosphorylation sites.Figure 2Point mutations in the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues do not affect the expression and the autophosphorylation of the env-sea protein. Lysates from parental Rat1 cells, stable cell lines expressing wild type or various mutant env-sea proteins, were prepared. A, 30 μg of total cell lysates was immunoblotted with anti-M45 antibody to detect M45-tagged env-sea proteins. B, 300 μg of total cell lysates was used to immunoprecipitate env-sea proteins with anti-sea antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The positions of the env-sea precursor protein (pr), gp155, and gp70 are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the effect of these mutations on transformation, the same cell lines were used to measure colony-forming abilities in soft agar. The results are shown in Fig. 3 and quantified in Table I. Cells expressing the Y557F mutant protein were able to transform cells to a level comparable to cells expressing wild type env-sea protein. In contrast, cells expressing the Y564F mutant protein formed even more colonies than wild type cells. Cells expressing the Y557/Y5572mutant protein produced fewer and smaller colonies than those induced by the wild type env-sea protein. Cells expressing the env-sea protein that have phenylalanine substitutions at both tyrosine residues (Y557F/Y564F) completely lost their ability to grow in agar. These data demonstrate that the tyrosines within this motif are essential for transformation, and in contrast to the results using comparable mutants in the Met protein, mutation of tyrosine 564 actually enhanced transformation.Table ITransformation efficiency of mutant env-sea proteinsenv-sea proteinNumber of colonies/105 cellsaNumbers are presented as an average of three independent experiments each in duplicate. 105 cells were seeded into 0.3% agar, and colonies were counted after 10 days of incubation.Relative transforming activityMock411Wild type3.1 × 103100Y557/Y557bSee Footnote 2.0.5 × 10316Y557F2.1 × 10367Y564F20.3 × 103654Y557F/Y564F471a Numbers are presented as an average of three independent experiments each in duplicate. 105 cells were seeded into 0.3% agar, and colonies were counted after 10 days of incubation.b See Footnote 2. Open table in a new tab We reasoned that the differences in transforming ability among mutant env-sea proteins come from changes in association with one or more SH2 domain-containing cellular target proteins. To further study protein-protein interactions mediated by these tyrosine residues, we utilized transient expression in COS1 cells. In COS1 cells, wild type and all mutant env-sea proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the env-sea proteins was monitored by immunoprecipitation with an anti-sea antibody followed by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation levels remained approximately the same for wild type, Y557F, Y557/Y557,2and Y564F env-sea proteins but were lower for the Y557F/Y564F mutant protein (Fig. 4B). This may reflect the fact that the Y557F/Y564F has lost two phosphorylation sites and only keeps the basal level of the autophosphorylation. Expression of a K318R env-sea protein, which has a point mutation in the ATP binding pocket that inactivates the kinase activity of Sea, lacked detectable tyrosine phosphorylation. This demonstrates that the tyrosine phosphorylation detected in the env-sea proteins is dependent on the kinase activity of Sea. The env-sea protein has previously been shown to be in a complex with the Grb2 protein, but the binding site has never been identified. Both tyrosines 557 and 564 are followed by the amino acid sequenceXNX (Fig. 1), which is a consensus Grb2 binding site (10Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar). To investigate which tyrosine is the binding site for Grb2, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. COS1 cells were transfected with the various constructs and the expression levels of the env-sea protein determined to be equivalent using Western blotting (Fig. 5A).Wild type or mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-sea antibody, and co-immunoprecipitated Grb2 was detected by immunoblotting. Grb2 was readily detected as being associated with the Y557F mutant protein as well as with wild type env-sea protein (Fig. 5B). There were only very weak Grb2 signals detected with Y557/Y5572 and Y564F proteins. When Grb2 was immunoprecipitated and the immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-M45 antibody, again, the Y557F mutant and wild type env-sea proteins were detected as being co-immunoprecipitated with Grb2, and the other three mutant proteins were not detected (Fig. 5C). This indicates that although both sites are consensus binding sites for Grb2, the env-sea protein and Grb2 form a complex in cells primarily through tyrosine 564. To determine whether the mutations in the env-sea protein affect the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with Grb2, we stripped the filter used in Fig. 5C and reprobed it with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig. 5D, Grb2 was associated with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in cells expressing the wild type env-sea protein. COS1 cells transfected with vector alone or with the Y557F/Y564F mutant construct showed basal levels of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb2-associated proteins (Fig. 5D). This indicates that although the Y557F/Y564F mutant protein is an active kinase, it does not induce the phosphorylation of Grb2-associated proteins or of any other cellular proteins (data not shown). In addition to the env-sea proteins gp155 and gp70, there were three prominent bands in cells expressing wild type and the other three mutant proteins, indicated by the arrows in Fig. 5D. The molecular weights of these three proteins are similar to those of the Shc proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that Shc is tyrosine-phosphorylated following activation of the env-sea protein and associates with Grb2 (17Crowe A.J. McGlade J. Pawson T. Hayman M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 537-544PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the mutant env-sea proteins were able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the Shc proteins, cells expressing equivalent amounts of wild type and mutant proteins (Fig. 6A) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc antibody, and then immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 6B). The levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc was increased to similar levels in cells expressing the Y557/Y557,2 Y557F, or Y564F mutant proteins, as well as in cells expressing the wild type protein. In contrast, there was no increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing either the dead kinase mutant, K318R, or in the Y557F/Y564F mutant. Shc is phosphorylated in Y564F-expressing cells and associates with Grb2. This interaction between Grb2 and Shc has been shown previously to lead to activation of downstream effectors, such as MAP kinase. Therefore, even though Grb2 is unable to associate directly with the Y564F protein, the phosphorylation of Shc that is induced by the Y564F protein could induce activation of MAP kinase. We decided to test this possibility. MAP kinase has been shown to require both tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation for activation (30Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.-H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 884-892Crossref Scopus (835) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation events result in a characteristic delayed mobility of MAP kinase by SDS-PAGE (31Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this mobility shift assay to determine whether the Shc-Grb2 complex formation correlates with the level of MAP kinase activation. As shown in Fig. 6C,activation of MAP kinase in Y564F mutant-expressing cells was equal to that found in the wild type-, Y557/Y557-,2 and Y557F mutant-expressing cells. In contrast, there was no increase in MAP kinase activation in cells expressing the Y557F/Y564F or K318R mutant proteins. Therefore it appears that all the mutant forms of env-sea protein that cause transformation can induce Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent MAP kinase activation. Examination of the amino acid sequence of the bidentate motif reveals that the site surrounding Tyr-557 is a perfect consensus binding site for PI3 kinase (YXXM) (Fig. 1). To determine whether PI3 kinase is bound to this site on the env-sea protein, we transfected the different forms of env-sea into COS1 cells. Analysis of env-sea protein expression revealed equivalent levels of expression (Fig. 7A), so we went ahead and formed immunoprecipitates with anti-PI3 kinase antibodies and analyzed the precipitates for the presence of the phosphorylated env-sea protein by Western blot. As can be seen in Fig. 7B, the wild type env-sea protein was co-immunoprecipitated by the PI3 kinase antibodies. In addition, the tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 subunit of the PI3 kinase enzyme was also readily detected in the immunoprecipitates. In contrast, mutation of Tyr-557 to phenylalanine drastically reduced the association of PI3 kinase with the env-sea protein, and tyrosine-phosphorylated p85 was also barely detectable. (Reprobing of the blot with antisera against PI3 kinase indicated equivalent levels of p85 in all lanes (data not shown).) Mutation of Tyr-564 had little effect on PI3 kinase association or p85 phosphorylation. Duplication of the Tyr-557 site in mutant Y557/Y5572 appeared to increase the association of the phosphorylated env-sea protein and PI3 kinase (Fig. 7B). Because the Y557/Y5572 mutant has a decreased transforming ability, there does not appear to be a simple relationship between PI3 kinase association and transformation by these env-sea mutants. The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is thought to be a positive regulator in RTK signaling (32Neel B.G. Seminars Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Tonks N.K.

To examine the effect of mutations on folding and assembly within a cellular context, bovine type X cDNAs containing analogous disease causing mutations Y598D, N617K, W651R, and wild-type were expressed in semi-permeabilized cells. We assessed trimerization of the mutant chains by their ability to form a collagen triple helix. Using this approach, we demonstrate that although there is an apparent lower efficiency of association of the mutant NC1 domains, they can drive the formation of correctly aligned triple helices with the same thermal stability as the wild-type collagen. When epitope-tagged mutant and wild-type collagen were co-expressed, heterotrimers could be detected by sequential immunoprecipitation. Both wild-type and mutant type X chains were found in association with the molecular chaperones protein disulfide isomerase and Hsp 47. The implications of these findings on the likely mechanism of Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia will be discussed.

Type X collagen is a small non-fibrillar collagen (Mr 59,000) synthesized exclusively in the epiphyseal growth plate during chondrocyte hypertrophy (1Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9504-9509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall domain structure of type X collagen is similar to the fibrillar procollagens in that there are three distinct domains: a short amino-terminal domain (NC2) 1The abbreviations used are: NC2, non-collagenous amino-terminal; SMCD, Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia; NC1, non-collagenous carboxyl-terminal; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SP cells, semi-permeabilized HT1080 fibroblasts; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; C-propeptide, carboxyl-terminal propeptide; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein of 38 amino acids, a collagenous triple helical domain of 463 amino acids, and a non-collagenous carboxyl-terminal (NC1) domain of 161 amino acids (2Thomas J.T. Kwan A.P.L. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, unlike the fibrillar procollagens, the propeptides are not cleaved following secretion into the extracellular matrix and are thought to play a role in assembly of the individual molecules into higher order structures (3Kwan A.P.L. Cummings C.E. Chapman J.A. Grant M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Mutations within the COL10A1 gene result in Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD), an autosomal dominant disorder of the osseous skeleton. The majority of these mutations map to the NC1 domain and include amino acid substitutions, nonsense mutations, and deletions (4Wallis G.A. Rash B. Sykes B. Bonaventure J. Maroteaux P. Zabel B. Wynnedavies R. Grant M.E. Boothandford R.P. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The only exceptions so far found are at the junction of the signal sequence and the NC2 domain (5Ikegawa S. Nakamura K. Nagano A. Haga N. Nakamura Y. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that may effect signal peptide cleavage. Significantly no mutations within the triple helical domain have been identified. Mutation within the NC1 domain has been proposed to effect the initial stages in the folding and assembly of type X collagen which are thought to occur in a similar fashion to the fibrillar procollagens (6McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Once fully translocated into the ER lumen, the constituent chains of the trimer associate via their carboxyl-terminal globular domains allowing nucleation of the triple helix to occur at the carboxyl-terminal end (7Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with subsequent propagation of the helix in a zipper-like fashion from the COOH- to the NH2-terminal direction (8Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Therefore mutations in the NC1 domain would be predicted to disrupt the initial association of type X chains and prevent nucleation of the triple helix. This hypothesis has been supported by studies on the in vitro transcription and translation of mutant and wild-type cDNAs within a cell-free system (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ability of the NC1 domain to associate and form trimers was assayed by the resistance of the trimer to denaturation by SDS. The wild-type trimer was shown to be particularly resistant to dissociation by SDS, a property not shared by the mutant chains. These results were taken to indicate that the mutant chains did not assemble and therefore that the effect of the mutation was to prevent correct folding of the mutant chain leading to its retention within the ER and subsequent degradation. Thus attempts to express mutant type X chains in cells grown in culture led to very poor levels of expression with little or no secretion of the mutant chains (10Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Lack of secretion of mutant chains would result in a reduction of the extracellular type X available for assembly. Thus, the current model for the mechanism of SMCD is haploinsufficiency. Here the phenotype would be explained simply by a 50% reduction in the level of type X secreted rather than a direct effect of the mutant chains on the assembly of the wild-type chains. This model is supported by the failure to detect, in one SMCD patient, any mutant type X protein in the extracellular matrix due to the degradation of the mutant transcript that contains a premature stop codon (11Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is corroborated by analysis of transgenic mice that are null alleles for type X that show some of the phenotypic changes associated with SMCD (12Kwan K.M. Pang M.K.M. Zhou S. Cowan S.K. Kong R.Y.C. Pfordte T. Olsen B.R. Sillence D.O. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, analogous transgenic null allele mice show no significant phenotypic change (13Rosati R. Horan G.S.B. Pinero G.J. Garofalo S. Keene D.R. Horton W.A. Vuorio E. Decrombrugghe B. Behringer R.R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Other evidence, however, raises the possibility that haploinsufficiency may not be the only mechanism underlying SMCD. Transgenic mice expressing chicken type X with a truncated helix show skeletal abnormalities (14Jacenko O. Luvalle P.A. Olsen B.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), pointing toward a dominant negative interference of the function of type X in the extracellular matrix. Trace amounts of heterotrimer could be detected during cell-free co-expression of wild-type and some point mutants (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) suggesting some co-assembly of these chains could occur. Significantly, the distribution of mutations within the NC1 domain are not random but clustered into three distinct regions (4Wallis G.A. Rash B. Sykes B. Bonaventure J. Maroteaux P. Zabel B. Wynnedavies R. Grant M.E. Boothandford R.P. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which is counterintuitive to a general folding defect in type X unless these regions alone are critical for assembly. The expression studies of mutant and wild-type chains using cell-free systems did not fully reconstitute the initial stages of collagen assembly (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the complete folding pathway of type X collagen can be reconstituted in semi-permeabilized cells (SP cells) (15McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This system was used here to address the question of whether mutant type X collagen chains can initiate triple helix formation within the ER lumen. We expressed type X containing SMCD mutations within each of the three clusters: Y598D (16Wallis G.A. Rash B. Sweetman W.A. Thomas J.T. Super M. Evans G. Grant M.E. Boothandford R.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 169-178PubMed Google Scholar), G617K (17Bonaventure J. Chaminade F. Maroteaux P. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and W651R (18Pokharel R.K. Alimsardjono H. Uno K. Fujii S. Shiba R. Matsuo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and analyzed their effects on folding, assembly, and triple helix formation (15McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrate that all three mutants can individually associate to form homotrimers to form thermally stable triple helices. We also show that heterotrimers can form between the wild-type and mutant type X and that the pattern of binding of the wild-type and mutant chains to molecular chaperones is identical. Recombinant bovine type X maintained in pSKBX has been previously described (15McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Quickchange kit (Stratagene Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) using the accompanying protocol. Using pSKBX as a template, the following complementary primers were used to generate point mutations (underlined) in the NC1 domain of bovine type X (amino acids are numbered from the translation start site of human pre-α1(X)): 5′-GATTCCAGGGATATATGACTTCTACCAC-3′ for Tyr598 → Asp (pSHM14); 5′-ACGACCAGGTAAGGCTCCAGCTG-3′ for Trp651 → Arg (pSHM15); and 5′-GTAGGTCTGTATAAGAAGGGCACCCCTGTA-3′ for Asn617 → Lys, (pS2). HA-tagged and Myc-tagged wild-type and mutant type X molecules were generated by PCR overlap extension using the principles outlined by Horton (19Horton R.M. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. 15. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 251-261Google Scholar). PCR reactions (100 μl) comprised template DNA (250 ng), oligonucleotide primers (100 pmol each) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, containing 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2–8 mmMgSO4, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 300 μmeach dNTP. Thirty rounds of amplification were performed in the presence of 1 unit of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Primary PCR products of approximately 300 base pairs were generated using a 5′-amplification primer (5′- CGCGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) which is complimentary to the T7 promoter sequence upstream of the initiation codon of type X with either SMYCR2 (5′-CAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATGAGCTTTTGCTCATAAAACACTCCAGAACCAAGT-3′) or SMHAR2 (5′-AGCGTAATCGGGTACGTCGTAGGGATAAAACACTCCATGAACCAAGT-3′) which are complimentary to the signal sequence and incorporate the coding sequence for the Myc or HA-tag, respectively (underlined). Using 5′-amplification primers SMYCF1 (5′-GAGCAAAAGCTCATTTCTGAAGAGGACTTGACTGAGCGATACCAAACACC-3′) or SMHAF1 (5′-CCCTACGACGTACCCGATTACGCTACTGAGCGATACCAAACACC-3′), which are complimentary to the start of the coding sequence for the mature type X with the 3′-amplification primer BXC (5′-AGCTGGAGCCATACCTGGTCGT-3′) which anneals within the coding region for the NC1 domain, primary PCR products of approximately 1.9 kilobases were generated. Primary PCR products were purified and used in overlap extension reactions that generated 2.2-kilobase products which were gel purified, EcoRV–PstI digested, and ligated into pSKBX, pSHM14, pSHM15, and pS2 which had previously been digested withEcoRV–PstI. All mutants and constructs were verified by sequencing. Transcription reactions were carried out as described by Gurevich et al. (20Gurevich V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. Obukhova T.A. Zozulya S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Full-length transcripts were obtained from 10 μg of pSKBX, pSHM14, pSHM15, or pS2 linearized with NotI. Transcription was initiated with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Southampton, UK) and carried out for 2 h at 37 °C. RNA was purified on RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, Dorking, UK) using the supplied buffers, eluting with 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated sterile distilled water containing 40 units of RNasin (Promega) and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Cultured HT1080 fibroblasts (ATCC-CCL121, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were permeabilized with the detergent digitonin (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK) at a final concentration of 40 μg/ml using a modification of the method of Plutner et al. (21Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) as described in Ref. 22Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar. RNA was translated using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Flexi-Lysate, Promega) at 30 °C in the absence of exogenous dithiothreitol. The translation reaction (25 μl) contained 17.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 0.5 μl of 1 mm amino acids (minus methionine), 0.5 μl of 2.5m KCl, 1.5 μl ofl-[35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml, ICN Biomedicals Ltd., Thane, Oxfordshire, UK), 1 μl of transcribed RNA, and 4 μl of semi-permeabilized HT1080 cells. Ascorbate (Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK) was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm. Translations were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. After translation,N-ethylmaleimide was added to 20 mm and aliquots were incubated on ice for 10 min. SP cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of KHM buffer (110 mm KOAc, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mmMgOAc) and re-isolated prior to endoglycosidase H digestion, chemical cross-linking, proteolysis, or electrophoresis. Products of translation were digested with endoglycosidase H as described previously (23Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) After translation cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of KHM buffer and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP, Sigma) was added to 1 mm final concentration from a 100 mm stock in dimethyl sulfoxide, followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. The cross-linker was quenched by addition of glycine to 40 mm, and incubating for a further 5 min. Prior to immunoprecipitation the cross-linked samples were denatured by adding SDS to 0.5% (w/v) final concentration and heating to 100 °C for 1 min. Immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% (w/v) gelatin, 0.10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) was then added to 1 ml and samples precleared by incubation with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10% (v/v) preincubated in NET-gel buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 40 min at 4 °C. After removal of protein A-Sepharose-bound material by centrifugation, the appropriate antiserum was added at a dilution of 1:500 along with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose and samples incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The goat anti-BiP polyclonal antibody was supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. The mouse anti-Hsp 47 monoclonal antibody was from Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada. The rabbit anti-protein disulfide isomerase polyclonal antibody was raised to purified bovine protein disulfide isomerase as described previously (24John D.C.A. Grant M.E.G. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). After incubation, pelleted complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. After translation cells were solubilized in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer and samples precleared by incubation with 40 μl of 10%(v/v) protein A-Sepharose. After removal of protein A-Sepharose-bound material by centrifugation, mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK) was added at a 1:500 dilution along with 40 μl of 10% (v/v) protein A-Sepharose. After incubation, pelleted complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The material immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody was eluted from the beads by addition of SDS to 1% (w/v) in a volume of 100 μl and heating to 100 °C. A small volume (10 μl) was taken for gel analysis while the rest of the sample was diluted to 1 ml in immunoprecipitation buffer. Any HA-tagged products were then immunoprecipitated with a rabbit anti-HA (12CA5) antibody diluted to 1:500 (Boehringer Mannheim, Lewes, E. Sussex, UK). Cell pellets were resuspended in CT/T buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100). Chymotrypsin and trypsin (Sigma) were added to 250 and 100 μg/ml final concentrations and samples incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Further digestion was stopped by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor to a final concentration of 5 mg/ml and 2.5 volume of boiling SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 5% (v/v) 2-merceptoethanol, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. Pelleted SP cells were resuspended in CT/T buffer and 16-μl aliquots were placed in a DNA thermal cycler. A stepwise temperature gradient was set up from 25 to 47 °C with the temperature being held for 2 min at 2 °C intervals. For a given temperature at the end of 2 min the sample was assayed with chymotrypsin/trypsin for 2 min as described above. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by mixing with an equal volume 2 times SDS-loading buffer (0.125m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.004% (w/v) bromphenol blue). When resistance to denaturation by heating in the presence of SDS was assayed a lower final concentration of SDS was used (0.5% w/v). Samples were reduced by addition of 5% (v/v) 2-merceptoethanol. The samples were boiled for 5 min before electrophoresis, unless otherwise stated. After electrophoresis, dried gels were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film or analyzed on a Fuji BAS 2000TR PhosphorImager. Previous experiments carried out to determine the ability of wild-type and mutant type X chains to form homotrimers involved expressing the RNA transcripts coding for these proteins in a cell-free system. The ability to assemble was assessed by the formation of a trimer that was resistant to denaturation after heating to 60 °C in presence of 2% (w/v) SDS and 2 m urea (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Under these conditions only the wild type was able to form a resistant trimer suggesting that the effect of the mutation was to prevent trimer formation. We wanted to determine whether the mutant chains were able to form trimers at all and whether the trimers formed would be more stable under milder denaturing conditions. For our experiments we used the bovine cDNA clone, the NC1 domain of which shares over 90% identity with the human NC1 domain. All the amino acids that have been identified as targets for mutations giving rise to SMCD are identical. Thus we constructed three analogous SMCD point mutations: Y598D which lies within a hydrophobic region of the NC1 domain predicted to be critical for trimer association (25Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boothandford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); G617K which disrupts the potential N-glycosylation site (Asn-Gly-Thr) in the NC1 domain (17Bonaventure J. Chaminade F. Maroteaux P. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); and W651R which lies in the third cluster of mutations in the NC1 domain (18Pokharel R.K. Alimsardjono H. Uno K. Fujii S. Shiba R. Matsuo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The cDNAs clones coding for these mutants were transcribed in vitro and translated in a reticulocyte lysate supplemented with SP cells that been shown to reconstitute the initial folding and assembly of fibrillar collagens and type X collagen (15McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The ability of the various mutants to assemble to form trimers was assayed by their resistance to denaturation by heating in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) SDS. As can be seen (Fig. 1) the wild-type and mutant chains were all able to assemble to form trimers which were resistant to denaturation when heated up to 60 °C but which were fully denatured at 100 °C. The N617K mutant formed these resistant trimers less efficiently than either the wild-type or other mutant chains, but the fact that any resistant trimers are formed demonstrates that the mutated NC1 domains can associate with themselves to form homotrimers. We confirmed previous results (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrating that the trimerization of the wild-type and mutant chains to form SDS-resistant molecules was due to an association at the NC1 domain by carrying out collagenase digestion (results not shown). At higher SDS concentrations all the mutant chains were denatured when heated to 60 °C whereas the wild-type chain was not (results not shown), confirming the previous results obtained with the human type X SMCD mutant chains (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The fact that the N617K mutant forms a trimer resistant to denaturation under these conditions less efficiently than the other chains could be due to this mutation abolishing the consensus sequence for glycosylation. This in turn could effect the solubility of the monomer and therefore the assembled trimer. As there is some confusion as to whether this glycosylation site is actually utilized in type X collagen we carried out endoglycosidase H digestion of the wild-type and mutant chains following translation in the presence of SP cells to determine the glycosylation status. As a control we translated tissue-type plasminogen activator which contains three sites for N-link glycosylation (27Allen S. Naim H.Y. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4797-4804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Clearly the tissue-type plasminogen activator translation product is susceptible to digestion with endoglycosidase H (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2) whereas there is no difference in mobility of the wild-type or N617K translation products after digestion (Fig. 2,lanes 3 and 4, lanes 5 and 6). There is also no difference in mobility between the wild-type and N617K mutant which would be expected if the glycosylation site was occupied. These results clearly demonstrate that this site is not occupied in type X collagen. The actual sequence in type X collagen has a proline residue following the glycosylation site. A proline in this position has previously been shown to inhibit glycosylation (28Mellquist J.L. Kasturi L. Spitalnik S.L. ShakinEshleman S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6833-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) providing a reason for the lack of occupancy of this site in type X collagen. Once we had shown that the type X chains containing point mutations associated with SMCD could associate to form homotrimers, we then wanted to determine whether the triple helical domains within these chains would fold correctly. Translation was carried out in the presence of SP cells and ascorbate to ensure hydroxylation of proline residues and the formation of a triple helix was assayed by resistance to digestion by a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin. The results (Fig. 3A) show that protease-resistant fragments corresponding to the collagenous domain of type X were generated after treatment of both wild-type and mutant chain with proteases. The efficiency of triple helix formation was determined by quantification of the translation products before and after protease treatment. The results (average over three experiments) illustrated that the wild-type chain folded efficiently (94%) whereas the mutant chains folded less efficiently than the wild-type (Y598D, 55%; N617K, 63%; W651R, 70%). The thermal stability of the triple helical domains formed by the wild-type and mutant chains was also assayed (Fig. 3B). The denaturation temperatures of the triple helix formed were very similar indicating that the extent of hydroxylation of the type X collagen is not influenced by these mutations in the NC1 domain. Thus the mutant chains are able to associate to form trimers and once these trimers have formed they can fold correctly to form a stable triple helix. Having established that mutant chains can form homotrimers we then went on to determine if the mutant chains could co-assemble with wild-type chains to form heterotrimers. The approach we took was to add one epitope tag (HA) to the wild-type chain and a different epitope tag (Myc) to a mutant chain (for these experiments we used the Y598D mutant). After co-translation of the two chains in the presence of SP cells we first immunoprecipitated the mutant chains with an anti-Myc antibody. Any wild-type chains that co-assembled with the mutant chains would also be immunoprecipitated under these conditions. The co-assembled wild-type chains could then be identified by first denaturing the anti-Myc immunoprecipitate and then immunoprecipitating with anti-HA. As a positive control for co-assembly, we tagged wild-type chains with Myc and co-translated Myc-tagged along with HA-tagged wild-type chains. We first established that the antibodies could specifically recognize the variously tagged chains by translating them individually. The wild-type chain tagged with the HA epitope was not immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc and consequently no radiolabeled product was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA from the anti-Myc immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the Y598D chain tagged with the Myc epitope was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc but no radiolabeled protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA from the anti-Myc immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that there is no nonspecific immunoprecipitation of chains using this sequential immunoprecipitation approach. When the wild-type chain tagged with the HA epitope was co-translated with either the wild-type chain or the Y598D chain tagged with the Myc epitope, radiolabeled material was present in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 7). Between 5 and 10% of this material was subsequently immunoprecipitated by anti-HA (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 8) demonstrating that the HA-tagged wild-type or the HA-tagged Y598D chains co-assembled with the Myc-tagged wild-type chains. We carried out a similar experiment by first immunoprecipitating with the anti-Myc antibody, carrying out a second immunoprecipitation with the anti-HA antibody, and obtained similar results (results not shown). These results demonstrate that within the environment of the ER both wild-type and chains containing SMCD mutations can co-assemble to form heterotrimers. The main conclusions that could be drawn from the preceding experiments was that both wild-type and mutant chains can assemble and fold to form homo- or heterotrimers. The trimers formed, however, differed in their sensitivity to heat denaturation in the presence of SDS which would suggest that the NC1 domain formed from mutant chains adopted a more open conformation than the NC1 domain formed from wild-type chains. One consequence of this change in conformation could be a more stable interaction with chaperone proteins within the ER, which in turn would lead to retention of the mutant protein within the cell. Alternatively mutant chains could interact with a different set of chaperones than the wild-type chains resulting in differential retention. To assess this point we determined whether there were any differences in the types of molecular chaperones that the wild-type or mutant chains interacted with in our SP cells. We translated both the wild-type and mutant chains individually and after isolation of the cells from the translation mixture cross-linked translated chains to interacting proteins using the bifunctional cross-linking reagent DSP. Essentially we obtained the same results irrespective of the type of chain we translated (Fig. 5). We have previously shown that the two main proteins that interact with type X are protein disulfide isomerase (Fig. 5, lanes 1–4) and Hsp 47 (Fig. 5, lanes 9–12). Previous work on mutation within the C-propeptide of fibrillar procollagens has shown that mutations that disrupt folding of the monomer result in an interaction of the misfolded chain with BiP (29Chessler S.D. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7751-7757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We could not detect any interaction of either the wild-type or mutant chains with BiP using this approach even though we have previously shown that the anti-BiP antibody can immunoprecipitate BiP following this cross-linking treatment (30Wilson R. Lees J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9637-9643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus our results do not suggest any significant differences in the way in which the main collagen binding chaperones interact with wild-type and mutant chains. The main objective of this study was to ascertain whether the phenotype underlying SMCD, which has been suggested to be due to a reduction in the level of secretion of mutant chains, could be explained by an intracellular folding and transport defect. The previous studies on the synthesis and folding of type X collagen chains containing point mutations associated with SMCD clearly demonstrated a difference in the resistance of the protein to dissociation by heating in the presence of SDS and urea (9Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here we show that this observation does not mean that the mutant chains cannot assemble to form trimers, only that the trimers once formed are more susceptible to dissociation than the wild-type under the conditions of this assay. Indeed the mutant chains were not only able to form homotrimers but were capable of nucleating triple helix formation to form a thermally stable triple helix. Interestingly the mutant chains were also able to co-assemble with the wild-type chains to form heterotrimers. These conclusions do not rely on the formation of NC1 domain trimers resistant to heating in the presence of SDS. Thus by three independent assays we have shown that point mutations associated with SMCD do not prevent association of the mutant chains with themselves or with wild-type chains. These results prove that the molecular mechanism underlying SMCD cannot be exclusively explained by haploinsufficiency as the mutant chains can co-assemble with wild-type chains. There is, however, at least one case where a 50% reduction of the level of expression of type X collagen leads to a SMCD phenotype (11Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly the mutations do alter the conformation of any homotrimers formed and would be predicted to have varying effects on the conformation of heterotrimers. This could lead to retention of trimers containing mutant chains within the ER with the consequence of a reduction in the level of type X chains secreted. Such a mechanism of ER “quality control” prevents the secretion of incompletely assembled or malfolded proteins and can be mediated either by glycoprotein-specific chaperones such as calnexin and calreticulin (31Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), by interaction with BiP or other ER-resident proteins (32Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or by a thiol-mediated process (33Reddy P. Sparvoli A. Fagioli C. Fassina G. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Attempts to evaluate whether homotrimers containing mutant chains could be secreted from intact cells have been hampered by their low levels of expression (10Chan D. Weng Y.M. Hocking A.M. Golub S. McQuillan D.J. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13566-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This low level of secretion in itself could be due to an efficient mechanism of retention of mutant chains leading to an increase in the intracellular degradation of the mutant homotrimers. No attempts to express both wild-type and mutant chains in the same cell have yet been reported and it would indeed be interesting to determine if heterotrimers of mutant and wild-type chains could be secreted. In this scenario the SMCD phenotype would be explained not by a lack of folding and assembly of the mutant chains but rather by a decrease in their stability with the overall result that fewer type X chains would be secreted and be available for assembly. The alternative explanation to intracellular degradation of trimers containing mutant chains is that these molecules are secreted normally but interfere with the normal function of type X collagen outside the cell. The most persuasive argument for such a mechanism to explain the SMCD phenotype arises from the fact that only these specific mutations give rise to SMCD. Other mutations within the NC1 domain that could effect folding of the monomer or the association of the monomers to form trimers would also be degraded and lead to a reduction in the levels of type X collagen secreted and should give rise to a SMCD phenotype. Thus the main characteristic of at least the point mutations studied here which cause SMCD is that they do not cause a general folding defect. This would argue that the effect of the point mutation is on either the assembly of the protein outside the cell or on an interaction with other extracellular matrix proteins as has been suggested previously (4Wallis G.A. Rash B. Sykes B. Bonaventure J. Maroteaux P. Zabel B. Wynnedavies R. Grant M.E. Boothandford R.P. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crucial experiment to verify such a mechanism would be the isolation of type X molecules containing mutant chains in the extracellular matrix of affected individuals. We thank Drs. Gillian Wallis, Ray Boot-Handford, Karl Kadler, and Debbie Marks for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2062963986,"Abstract In the mitochondrial ATP synthase (mtATPase) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the stoichiometry of subunits d, oligomycin-sensitivity conferring protein (OSCP), and b is poorly defined. We have investigated the stoichiometry of these subunits by the application of hexahistidine affinity purification technology. We have previously demonstrated that intact mtATPase complexes incorporating a Hex6-tagged subunit can be isolated via Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (Bateson, M., Devenish, R. J., Nagley, P., and Prescott, M. (1996) Anal. Biochem. 238, 14–18). Strains were constructed in which Hex6-tagged versions of subunits d, OSCP, and b were coexpressed with the corresponding wild-type subunit. This coexpression resulted in a mixed population of mtATPase complexes containing untagged wild-type and Hex6-tagged subunits. The stoichiometry of each subunit was then assessed by determining whether or not the untagged wild-type subunit could be recovered from Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid purifications as an integral component of those complexes absorbed by virtue of the Hex6-tagged subunit. As only the Hex6-tagged subunit was recovered from such purifications, we demonstrate that the stoichiometry of subunits d, OSCP, and b in yeast is 1 in each case."

DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that catalyze changes in the topology of DNA via a mechanism involving the transient breakage and rejoining of phosphodiester bonds in the DNA backbone (1$$Google Scholar). Studies in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have demonstrated the importance of topoisomerases in transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation. The type II topoisomerases, which make transient double-strand breaks and change the linking number of DNA in steps of two, play key roles in chromosome structure. In eukaryotic cells, these enzymes are essential for chromosome condensation/decondensation and decatenation of chromosome loops during mitosis (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

Azatoxin is also a nonintercalative top2 poison (10Leteurtre F. Madalengoitia J. Orr A. Guzi T.J. Lehnert E. Macdonald T. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4478-4483PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that 6,8-difluoro-7-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)-1-cyclopropyl-4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid (CP-115, 953), a fluoroquinolone closely related to ciprofloxacin, is highly toxic to mammalian cells in culture (11Elsea S.H.

In Escherichia coli, mutations that lead to quinolone resistance are most often found in gyrA, the structural gene for the DNA gyrase A subunit. Ser83 of gyrA is the amino acid most frequently changed in strains with high levels of quinolone resistance, although other mutations in eithergyrA or gyrB can lead to quinolone resistance (15Cabral J.H.

Mutations that change Ser83 to either leucine or tryptophan confer high levels of quinolone resistance, whereas changing Ser83 to alanine results in a low level of quinolone resistance (16Conrad S.

Etoposide (VP-16) was obtained from Bristol-Myers Co., Wallingford, CT. Amsacrine and mitoxantrone were from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch (NCI, National Institutes of Health). Azatoxin was provided by Dr. T. Macdonald, Department of Chemistry of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville. CP-115,953 was the gift of Drs. P. R. McGuirk and T. D. Gootz of Pfizer Laboratories. Drug stock solutions were made in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 mm. Further dilutions were made in distilled water immediately before use. Human c-myc inserted into pBR322, restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide, and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Lofstrand Labs (Gaithersburg, MD), Life Technologies, Inc., New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), or Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. PCR oligonucleotide-primer were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Three sets of labeled DNA fragments were prepared from the human c-mycgene by PCR. A 254-base pair DNA fragment from the first intron was prepared between positions 3035 and 3288, with numbers referring to GenBank genomic positions using oligonucleotides 5′-GTAATCCAGAACTGGATCGG-3′ for the upper strand and 5′-ATGCGGTCCCTACTCCAAGG-3′ for the lower strand (annealing temperature, 56 °C). A 401-base pair DNA fragment from the junction between the first intron and first exon was prepared between positions 2671 and 3072 using oligonucleotides 5′-TGCCGCATCCACGAAACTTT-3′ for the upper strand and 5′-TTGACAAGTCACTTTACCCC-3′ for the lower strand (annealing temperature, 60 °C). A 480-base pair fragment from the first exon containing promoters P1 and P2 was prepared between positions 2265 and 2745 using the oligonucleotides: 5′-GATCCTCTCTCGCTAATCTCCGCCC-3′ for the upper strand and 5′-TCCTTGCTCGGGTGTTGTAAGTTCC-3′ for the lower strand (annealing temperature, 70 °C). Single-end labeling of these DNA fragments was obtained by 5′-end labeling of the adequate primer oligonucleotide. 10 pmol of DNA was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 10 pm [γ-32P]ATP (100 μCi) in kinase buffer (70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were stopped by heat denaturation at 70 °C for 15 min. After purification using Sephadex G-25 columns (Boehringer Mannheim), the labeled oligonucleotides were used for PCR. Approximately 0.1 μg of the c-myc DNA that had been restricted bySmaI and PvuII (fragment 2265–2745),XhoI and XbaI (fragment 2671–3072 and fragment 3035–3288) was used as template for the PCR. 10 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer, one of them being 5′-labeled, was used in 22 temperature cycle reactions (each cycle with 94 °C for 1 min, annealing for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min). The last extension was for 10 min. DNA was purified using PCR Select-II columns (5Prime-3Prime, Inc. Boulder, CO). Wild-type yeast top2 and Ser740→ Trp proteins were overexpressed using YEpTOP2-PGAL1 or YEptop2-S*W-PGAL1 using yeast strain JEL1t1− (24Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DNA fragments (5–10 × 104 dpm/reaction) were equilibrated with or without drug in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm ATP, and 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 5 min before the addition of 8 units (80 ng) of purified top2 in a 10-μl final reaction volume. Calcium-promoted DNA cleavage was performed in the same buffer with 5 mm CaCl2 instead of MgCl2. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 30 min and thereafter stopped by adding 1% SDS and 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K (final concentrations) followed by an additional incubation at 55 °C for 30 min. For DNA sequence analysis, samples were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 5 μl of loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and thereafter loaded onto DNA sequencing gels (7% polyacrylamide; 19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) containing 7 m urea in 1 ×Tris borate/EDTA buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at 2,500 volts (60 watts) for 2–3 h. The gels were dried on Whatman No. 3MM paper sheets and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and ImageQuant software. The determination of preferred bases around top2 cleavage sites was done as described previously (20Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,21Pommier Y. Capranico G. Orr A. Kohn K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5973-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The cleavage sites induced by the top2S740W protein in the presence of various top2 poisons were mapped in the upper and lower strands of a fragment of the human c-myc gene. This DNA fragment includes the junction between the first exon and first intron (28Leteurtre F. Kohlhagen G. Fesen M.R. Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7893-7900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 presents the cleavage pattern obtained in the presence of etoposide, azatoxin, the fluoroquinolone CP-115,953, and the intercalating agents amsacrine and mitoxantrone. The top2S740W protein was characterized previously as partially resistant to fluoroquinolones; and when compared with the wild-type enzyme, several cleavage sites induced in the presence of CP-115,953 were reduced markedly. For example, cleavage by top2S740W on the upper strand of the c-mycDNA fragment at positions 2707, 2718, 2741, 2746, and 2768 was clearly reduced. By contrast, the mutant protein caused increased cleavage at specific sites in presence of etoposide, e.g. at positions 2711, 2712, 2781, 3026, and 3019 compared with the wild-type enzyme. Azatoxin, another nonintercalating top2 poison (10Leteurtre F. Madalengoitia J. Orr A. Guzi T.J. Lehnert E. Macdonald T. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4478-4483PubMed Google Scholar), also showed enhanced DNA cleavage at several sites. It should be noted that reduced cleavage in the presence of etoposide occurs at other sites,e.g. 2839 and 2776. The intercalating agent mitoxantrone resulted in less cleavage with the top2S740W protein at sites such as 2707, 2735, 2785, 2807, 2953, and 2974, whereas at other sites, less cleavage was seen with the wild-type protein (e.g. positions 2813, 2898, 2901, and 3011). Similarly, multiple changes in the cleavage sites induced in the presence of amsacrine were seen. The result with amsacrine is particularly interesting because the wild-type and top2S740W protein have similar sensitivities to amsacrine in vivo (25Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that the Ser740→ Trp mutation affects the DNA cleavage patterns induced by both intercalating and nonintercalating drugs. To investigate whether the altered DNA cleavage activity of the top2S740Wwas drug-dependent, we compared the calcium-promoted DNA cleavage (29Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) for the Ser740 → Trp protein and the wild-type enzyme in the two strands of the c-mycfirst intron fragment (Fig. 2). Even in the presence of magnesium, differences in the cleavage patterns could be observed. When magnesium was replaced by calcium, higher levels of DNA cleavage were seen with both proteins. DNA cleavage sites common to both proteins were seen in the presence of Ca2+; however, there were also major differences in the intensity of cleavage at other sites. Most of the sites of DNA cleavage in the upper and lower strands were staggered by 4 base pairs with a 5′-overhang, as expected for concerted top2-induced double-strand cleavage (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 5Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar, 7Liu L. DNA Topoisomerases:Topoisomerase-targeting Drugs. Academic Press, New York1994Google Scholar). These results suggest that the top2S740W mutation also alters DNA cleavage in the absence of a topoisomerase II poison. As described above, the top2S740W protein is hypersensitive to etoposide. It was therefore of considerable interest to examine the effect of this mutation on the DNA base preference of top2 in the presence of this drug (Fig. 3). Cleavage sites for three c-myc DNA fragments (see “Experimental Procedures”) were analyzed for both DNA strands. For the wild-type top2 protein, etoposide preferentially stabilized sites with C−1 (103 out of 167 sites) (Fig. 3C). This result agrees well with previous analyses of cleavage of the same DNA fragments by human top2 in the presence of etoposide (5Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar, 30Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Preference on the opposite strand showed a complementary (although slightly weaker) preference for G+5. Top2S740W also demonstrated a strong preference for C−1. In addition, a novel preference for C at position −2 (94 out of 176 sites) in combination with the complementary G at position +6 (84 out of 176 sites) was also seen. To focus on the impact of the Ser740→ Trp mutation on base preference, we analyzed separately those DNA cleavage sites exclusively detectable for top2S740W or for the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3B). These unique DNA cleavage sites did not show any clear C−1 or G+5 preference for either protein, which is expected because both proteins have a C−1/G+5 preference. However, top2S740W still showed a significant preference of C at position −2 (45 out of 63 sites) in combination with a preference for the complementary G at position +6 (39 out of 63 sites). In addition, a chi-square test indicated that the combination of the C−1 and C−2 preference in the top2S740W was not significantly more frequent than having C−1 or C−2 alone. Thus, the novel C−2 base preference in the top2S740W is independent of the C−1 preference. In contrast, the cleavage sites unique for the wild-type protein tended to exclude sites with C+2 (7 out of 54 sites) and with G+6 (9 out of 54 sites). These data show a change in the protein-DNA interaction resulting from the Ser740→ Trp mutation, leading to an extension of the base preference for the C−2 position in the presence of etoposide.Figure 3Probability of the observed base frequency deviations at top2 cleavage sites for the wild-type enzyme or for the Ser740 → Trp mutant top2 in the presence of 100 μm etoposide.Position 0 corresponds to the cleavage site.

Cleavage reactions were carried out with the wild-type or the Ser740→ Trp top2 for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were heated to 65 °C for various times before the addition of SDS. Fig. 4shows the result for the upper (panel A) and lower strand (panel B) of the c-myc fragment corresponding to the first intron. Most of the etoposide-stabilized cleavage sites were readily reversible for the wild-type protein. In contrast, a number of cleavage sites induced by top2S740W showed slow reversal (e.g. positions 3073, 3091, 3163, 3223, and 3183) or no detectable reversal after a 30-min incubation at 65 °C (e.g. positions 3167, 3171, 3241, 3174, and 3170). Enhanced heat stability of the DNA cleavage sites induced by top2S740W was also observed in the other c-mycDNA fragments (data not shown). To focus on the role of etoposide-protein-DNA interactions on the stability of the DNA-enzyme interaction, the salt reversibility (0.5m NaCl final concentration) of the calcium-promoted or etoposide-stabilized cleavage complexes was examined (Fig. 5). The calcium-promoted cleavage complexes were readily salt reversible for both top2S740Wand the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5A). By contrast, all etoposide-stabilized cleavages induced by top2S740W were completely salt-stable even after 30 min. Most of the cleavage complexes reversed at least partially for the wild-type top2 (Fig. 5B). These results support previous results suggesting that etoposide more strongly stabilizes the top2·DNA complexes formed with the top2S740W enzyme. Lee and Hsieh (31Lee M.P. Hsieh T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5027-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) showed previously that heat or salt incompletely reversed teniposide-stabilized covalent complexes induced withDrosophila top2. They did not observe stable DNA double-strand cleavage following heat or salt reversal. To determine whether the etoposide-stabilized, heat-stable top2S740Wcleavages were predominantly DNA single- or double-strand breaks, we performed nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6). Several strong cleavage sites were observed on nondenaturing gels, indicating that the top2S740W protein generates stable double-as well as single-strand breaks. Slight heat stability was also seen with the wild-type top2 mediated at sites 3171, 3175, and 3238, but the stability was consider-ably less than was seen with the top2S740W protein. Because the top2S740W exhibited a large number of cleavage sites with different reversal kinetics after heat treatment, we sequenced these sites to study the influence of local base preference on top2 religation kinetics for the top2S740W (Fig. 7). Etoposide-stabilized cleavage sites were divided into rapidly reversible (complete reversal within 2 min at 65 °C) or slowly reversible (incomplete reversal after 2 min). Cleavage sites with slow reversibility exhibited highly significant preference for C−1 (78 out of 89 sites) in combination with a less strong C−2 preference (54 out of 89 sites) (Fig. 7B). Complementary preference was observed on the opposite strand with preference (although weaker) for G+5 (53 out of 89 sites) and G+6 (36 out of 89 sites) as well. In contrast, rapidly reversible cleavage sites did not show any base preference at positions −1 and −2. However, they displayed a significant G+5 and G+6 base preference, indicating DNA cleavages in the complementary strand with a C−1 and C−2 base preference. These data are consistent with the formation of stable cleavage complexes when the preferred base(s) occur(s) on the DNA strand that is cleaved by the enzyme. Religation is influenced less by the base sequence on the opposite strand. A number of factors contribute to the sensitivity of cells toward agents targeted to the type II topoisomerases (32Pommier Y. Leteurtre F. Fesen M. Fujimori A. Bertrand R. Solary E. Kohlhagen G.

Top2 mutations that alter drug-induced DNA cleavage result in marked alterations, ranging from high resistance (26Elsea S.H. Hsiung Y. Nitiss J.L. Osheroff N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1913-1920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which mutations within the enzyme alter drug sensitivity have not been defined. Decreased drug binding to the top2·DNA complex has been reported for quinolone-resistant DNA gyrase with a Ser83 → Trp mutation in the A subunit (7Liu L. DNA Topoisomerases:Topoisomerase-targeting Drugs. Academic Press, New York1994Google Scholar, 38Willmott C.J. Maxwell A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 126-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A homologous mutation in the yeast top2 gene, which changes Ser740 into Trp, also results in quinolone resistance (19Hsiung Y. Elsea S.H. Osheroff N. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20359-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The same region of the protein is clearly important for determining sensitivity to eukaryotic topoisomerase II poisons because the mutation also causes hypersensitivity to etoposide (19Hsiung Y. Elsea S.H. Osheroff N. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20359-20364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The results presented in this report show that the Ser740→ Trp mutation in yeast top2 affects the DNA-protein interactions. In the absence of any drug, the calcium-promoted DNA cleavage sites of top2S740W were clearly different from those induced by the wild-type enzyme, indicating a change in DNA recognition. Amino acid residue 740 is part of the α4 DNA-recognition helix within the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif of top2 (39Berger J.M. Wang J.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This HTH motif and its counterpart in E. coli gyrase are mutational hotspots for resistance to drugs that stabilize the cleaved state of DNA (15Cabral J.H. Jackson A.P. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 39Berger J.M. Wang J.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). DNA footprinting has shown that for top2 and DNA gyrase approximately 15–35 base pairs of DNA are protected by the enzyme (40Gmunder H. Kuratli K. Keck W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 41Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25286-25290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, a 29-kDa fragment containing the active-site tyrosine and the HTH motif can be cross-linked to DNA (42Hung F. Luo D. Sauve D.M. Muller M.T. Roberge M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and protein footprinting has demonstrated that the presence of DNA protects the HTH motif from chemical modification (43Li W. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31190-31205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The data of this study are consistent with a direct interaction of the HTH motif with DNA (44Berger J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Peptides containing aromatic amino acids are known to be capable of partial intercalation with DNA (45Robledo-Luiggi C. Wilson W.D. Pares E. Vera M. Martinez C.S. Santiago D. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). NMR titrations with complexes between double-strand DNA and tryptophan-containing peptides confirmed the possibility of intercalation (46Sartorius J. Schneider H.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, Fig. 8 presents the position of Ser740 on the protein surface and its close proximity to the DNA. In addition, Ser740 is approximately 3.0 Å from Tyr734, and these residues could form a hydrogen bond. Thus, the Ser740→ Trp mutation could alter the DNA-top2 interaction directly by intercalation as well as indirectly by changing the enzyme conformation and modifying DNA recognition. The Ser740 → Trp mutation in yeast top2 also markedly affected the protein-drug interaction. We presented two lines of evidence that, compared with the wild-type protein, the increased heat and salt stability of top2S740W-induced DNA cleavages are dependent on etoposide interaction. First, calcium-promoted cleavages, although presenting an altered DNA-protein interaction, were readily reversible. Second, cleavages on a DNA strand without the etoposide-preferred bases by cooperative effects with the other subunit are also readily reversible (30Capranico G. Binaschi M. Borgnetto M.E. Zunino F. Palumbo M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 47Bigioni M. Zunino F. Capranico G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2274-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The fact that a single mutation at amino acid residue 740 changed the quinolone as well as the etoposide sensitivity is consistent with previous studies suggesting that quinolones share a common interaction domain on eukaryotic top2 with other DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs (48Elsea S.H. Westergaard M. Burden D.A. Lomenick J.P. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2919-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on drug-associated preferences for the bases immediately flanking the top2-linked DNA cleavage site, we also proposed a drug-stacking model in which the drugs generally occupy a common site at the interface of the enzyme and the ends of the cleaved DNA (5Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar, 20Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our data provide evidence that the Ser740 → Trp mutation might directly or indirectly change at least overlapping quinolone-protein and etoposide-protein interaction domains. Furthermore, we found a novel C−2 base preference in the top2S740W in the presence of etoposide. This new C−2 preference proved to be statistically independent of the common C−1 preference. These findings suggest a model of a more relaxed drug binding site for the Ser740→ Trp enzyme allowing etoposide to interact with C−2 in addition to C−1. This model does not conflict with the hypothesis of etoposide acting at the DNA-protein interface (5Pommier Y. Teicher B.A. Cancer Therapeutics: Experimental and Clinical Agents. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 153-174Crossref Google Scholar, 21Pommier Y. Capranico G. Orr A. Kohn K.W.

Sci. 1997; 18: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) because the altered interface between the top2S740W and its DNA substrate is likely to increase the etoposide binding affinity and hence to increase the stability of the ternary complex. The results of this study suggest a DNA-top2 binding site on the protein surface, which is directly or indirectly affected by amino acid residue 740 and hence controls the binding of drugs including quinolones and etoposide to the top2·DNA complex. Further structural studies with wild-type and Ser740→ Trp mutant top2 in the presence of DNA and inhibitors are awaited. A DNA fragment of the c-myc first intron between positions 3185 and 3168, containing several highly salt- and heat-stable cleavage sites, could be a suitable DNA substrate. We thank Drs. Q. Liu and J. C. Wang for providing data to generate Fig. 8. We also thank Dr. T. Macdonald, Department of Chemistry, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, and Drs. P. R. McGuirk and T. D.

In the present work we identify the activated G-proteins as Go-proteins by tracing their depolarization-inducedin situ photoaffinity labeling with [α32P]GTP-azidoanilide (GTPAA). Labeled GTPAA was introduced into transiently permeabilized rat brain-stem synaptoneurosomes. The resealed synaptoneurosomes, while being UV-irradiated, were depolarized. Relative to synaptoneurosomes at resting potential, the covalent binding of [α32P]GTPAA to Gαo1- and Gαo3-proteins, but not to Gαo2- isoforms, was enhanced by 5- to 7-fold in depolarized synaptoneurosomes, thereby implying an accelerated exchange of GDP for [α32P]GTPAA. Their depolarization-induced photoaffinity labeling was independent of stimulation of Go-protein-coupled receptors and could be reversed by membrane repolarization, thus excluding induction by transmitters release. It was, however, dependent on depolarization-induced activation of the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC), regardless of Na+ current. The α subunit of VGSC was cross-linked and co-immunoprecipitated with Gαo-proteins in depolarized brain-stem and cortical synaptoneurosomes. VGSC α subunit most efficiently cross-linked with guanosine 5′-O-2-thiodiphosphate-bound rather than to guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)-bound Gαo-proteins in isolated synaptoneurosomal membranes. These findings support a possible involvement of VGSC in depolarization-induced activation of Go-proteins.

[α32P]-GTPAA was introduced into transiently permeabilized synaptoneurosomes as described before (10Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the endogenously bound guanine nucleotides, [α32P]GTPAA, covalently bound to Gα-proteins by photoaffinity labeling, was not displaced during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, providing a possible tool for identification of in situ activated G-proteins.In view of findings indicating a reciprocal influence of depolarization-induced activation of VGSC and uncoupling of G-proteins from muscarinic receptors (12Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9824-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that VGSC can be involved in depolarization-induced activation of Gαo-proteins. Our results indicated that depolarization-induced activation of Go-proteins can be prevented by preventing VGSC activation. In addition, in depolarized brain-stem and cortical synaptoneurosomes, the α subunit of VGSC cross-linked most efficiently with Gαo-proteins. In isolated synaptoneurosomal membranes, VGSC-α subunit cross-linked most efficiently with GDPβS-bound rather than GTPγS-bound Gαo-proteins. These findings suggest repeated interactions between VGSC-α subunit and Gαo-proteins as long as membrane depolarization lasts.DISCUSSIONThe experiments described in this study provide evidence for a depolarization-induced activation of Go1-protein and its isoform Go3-protein in membranes of rat brain-stem synaptoneurosomes. The voltage-induced effect was clearly demonstrated by comparing their in situ photoaffinity labeling with [α32P]GTPAA in membranes of depolarized synaptoneurosomes with that in synaptoneurosomes at resting potential (Figs. 1, 2, and 4). The increased photoaffinity labeling of Gαo1 and Gαo3 subtypes in depolarized synaptoneurosomes and the shift in their isoelectric pH toward a more acidic pH (Figs. 1 and 2) are attributable to an accelerated exchange of GDP for GTPAA. This is also consistent with the depolarization-induced inhibition of PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαo-proteins (Fig. 6). The depolarization-induced exchange of GDP for [α32P]GTPAA in Gαo-proteins was reversed by repolarization and was independent of transmitters release and stimulation of muscarinic, NMDA-glutamate receptors, dopaminergic, or serotonergic receptors (2Pfaffinger P.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 3909-3915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Figs. 4 and 5). Thus, it is apparently not a consequence of depolarization-induced release of these transmitters into the synaptic cleft (42Betz H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3591-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).The shift in the isoelectric pH of photoaffinity-labeled Gαo1- and Gαo3-proteins in depolarized membranes (Fig. 2) could also be associated with Gαo-protein phosphorylation. This seems unlikely, however, in view of the negligible effect of membrane depolarization on their labeled in situ phosphorylation under the experimental conditions employed (Fig. 9).Membrane depolarization or changes in the electric field of the membrane would induce charge redistribution in the phospholipid matrix, which may modify the anchorage of Gαo-proteins to phospholipids (53Casey P.J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5544-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Voltage-induced modifications in the phospholipid matrix might be also mediated by voltage-induced modifications in voltage-gated ion channels. In view of the reciprocal effects of VGSC activation and the activation of G-coupled muscarinic receptors (12Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9824-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that depolarization-induced activation of VGSC is involved in depolarization-induced activation of Go-proteins. Unlike in other excitable tissues, the α subunit of the VGSC in the brain is covalently bound to a glycoprotein with a single transmembrane spanning segment, the β2 subunit of VGSC (69Isom L.L. Ragsdale D.S. De Jongh K.S. Westenbroek R.E. Reber B.F.X. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 70Sheng M. Kim E. Cur. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Evidence for a possible role of β2 in the anchorage of the α subunit of the VGSC to phospholipids may suggest its involvement in the interaction of VGSC with other proteins anchored to the phospholipid matrix (70Sheng M. Kim E. Cur. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In view of this, the possibility that voltage-induced modifications in the α subunit of VGSC may influence other membrane proteins, including Gαo-proteins, should be considered and further examined.DPI-enantiomers that interact with a common site in the α subunit of VGSC (45Romey G. Quast U. Pauron D. Frelin C. Renaud J.F. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) modulate differently its voltage-dependent activation (45Romey G. Quast U. Pauron D. Frelin C. Renaud J.F. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Only the DPI R enantiomer, which prevents the activation of VGSC (45Romey G. Quast U. Pauron D. Frelin C. Renaud J.F. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), prevented both the depolarization-induced exchange of GDP for [α32P]GTPAA in Go-proteins (Figs. 7, A and B) and the depolarization-induced uncoupling of G-proteins from muscarinic receptors (Fig. 7C). This supports the assumption that depolarization-induced activation of VGSC may be involved in depolarization-induced activation of Go-proteins. This assumption was further supported by the efficient cross-linking of VGSC-α subunit with Gαo-proteins during depolarization (Figs. 8, A and C). In addition, GDP-bound Gαo-proteins most efficiently cross-linked with the α subunit of VGSC in isolated synaptoneurosomal membranes (Fig. 8C). Regarding the GTPase activity of Gαo-proteins (7Kleuss C. Raw A.S. Lee E. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9828-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), these findings may suggest repeated interactions between α subunit of VGSC and Gαo-proteins, as long as depolarization lasts (Fig. 8). Taken together, these findings support a possible depolarization-induced interaction between these proteins, which might be involved in depolarization-induced activation of Go-proteins.Voltage-dependent activation of Go-proteins would imply a voltage-induced modulation of signal transduction cascades triggered by stimulation of Go-coupled-receptors. An example of reciprocal influence of membrane potential and receptor activity has been observed in muscarinic receptors (10Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9824-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent findings indicated a voltage-dependent modulation of the affinity of presynaptic muscarinic receptors (M2) providing an autoregulation of transmitter release (71Slutsky I. Parnas H. Parnas I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10 (suppl.) (abstr.): 174Google Scholar). Also, modulation of the oscillatory properties of entorhinal cortex layer II neurons has been attributed to a reciprocal effect of post-synaptic membrane potential and the activation of muscarinic (M1) receptors (72Klink R. Alonso A. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 1813-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to activation of ion channels by stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (1Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 73Ma J.Y. Li M. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This in turn may result feedback mechanisms, producing long term changes in the membrane potential.Because receptor stimulation induces activation of several receptor-coupled G-proteins (4Coulter S. Rodbell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5842-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), depolarization-induced activation of even a fraction of Go-proteins may affect the activity of other G-proteins, as well (10Cohen-Armon M.

Chem. 1986; 261: 12498-12505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby producing additional versatility in synaptic transmissions in the central nervous system. GTP-binding trimeric proteins have been implicated in signal transduction from receptors in the cell membrane to intracellular effectors and ion channels in a variety of cells (1Gilman A.G. Biosci.

[α32P]-GTPAA was introduced into transiently permeabilized synaptoneurosomes as described before (10Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the endogenously bound guanine nucleotides, [α32P]GTPAA, covalently bound to Gα-proteins by photoaffinity labeling, was not displaced during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, providing a possible tool for identification of in situ activated G-proteins. In view of findings indicating a reciprocal influence of depolarization-induced activation of VGSC and uncoupling of G-proteins from muscarinic receptors (12Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9824-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that VGSC can be involved in depolarization-induced activation of Gαo-proteins. Our results indicated that depolarization-induced activation of Go-proteins can be prevented by preventing VGSC activation. In addition, in depolarized brain-stem and cortical synaptoneurosomes, the α subunit of VGSC cross-linked most efficiently with Gαo-proteins. In isolated synaptoneurosomal membranes, VGSC-α subunit cross-linked most efficiently with GDPβS-bound rather than GTPγS-bound Gαo-proteins. These findings suggest repeated interactions between VGSC-α subunit and Gαo-proteins as long as membrane depolarization lasts. DISCUSSIONThe experiments described in this study provide evidence for a depolarization-induced activation of Go1-protein and its isoform Go3-protein in membranes of rat brain-stem synaptoneurosomes. The voltage-induced effect was clearly demonstrated by comparing their in situ photoaffinity labeling with [α32P]GTPAA in membranes of depolarized synaptoneurosomes with that in synaptoneurosomes at resting potential (Figs. 1, 2, and 4). The increased photoaffinity labeling of Gαo1 and Gαo3 subtypes in depolarized synaptoneurosomes and the shift in their isoelectric pH toward a more acidic pH (Figs. 1 and 2) are attributable to an accelerated exchange of GDP for GTPAA. This is also consistent with the depolarization-induced inhibition of PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαo-proteins (Fig. 6). The depolarization-induced exchange of GDP for [α32P]GTPAA in Gαo-proteins was reversed by repolarization and was independent of transmitters release and stimulation of muscarinic, NMDA-glutamate receptors, dopaminergic, or serotonergic receptors (2Pfaffinger P.J.

Thus, it is apparently not a consequence of depolarization-induced release of these transmitters into the synaptic cleft (42Betz H.

This seems unlikely, however, in view of the negligible effect of membrane depolarization on their labeled in situ phosphorylation under the experimental conditions employed (Fig. 9).Membrane depolarization or changes in the electric field of the membrane would induce charge redistribution in the phospholipid matrix, which may modify the anchorage of Gαo-proteins to phospholipids (53Casey P.J.

In view of the reciprocal effects of VGSC activation and the activation of G-coupled muscarinic receptors (12Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol.

Unlike in other excitable tissues, the α subunit of the VGSC in the brain is covalently bound to a glycoprotein with a single transmembrane spanning segment, the β2 subunit of VGSC (69Isom L.L.

Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Evidence for a possible role of β2 in the anchorage of the α subunit of the VGSC to phospholipids may suggest its involvement in the interaction of VGSC with other proteins anchored to the phospholipid matrix (70Sheng M. Kim E. Cur. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 602-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In view of this, the possibility that voltage-induced modifications in the α subunit of VGSC may influence other membrane proteins, including Gαo-proteins, should be considered and further examined.DPI-enantiomers that interact with a common site in the α subunit of VGSC (45Romey G. Quast U. Pauron D. Frelin C. Renaud J.F. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) modulate differently its voltage-dependent activation (45Romey G. Quast U. Pauron D. Frelin C. Renaud J.F. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl.

Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), prevented both the depolarization-induced exchange of GDP for [α32P]GTPAA in Go-proteins (Figs. 7, A and B) and the depolarization-induced uncoupling of G-proteins from muscarinic receptors (Fig. 7C). This supports the assumption that depolarization-induced activation of VGSC may be involved in depolarization-induced activation of Go-proteins. This assumption was further supported by the efficient cross-linking of VGSC-α subunit with Gαo-proteins during depolarization (Figs. 8, A and C). In addition, GDP-bound Gαo-proteins most efficiently cross-linked with the α subunit of VGSC in isolated synaptoneurosomal membranes (Fig. 8C). Regarding the GTPase activity of Gαo-proteins (7Kleuss C. Raw A.S. Lee E. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9828-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), these findings may suggest repeated interactions between α subunit of VGSC and Gαo-proteins, as long as depolarization lasts (Fig. 8). Taken together, these findings support a possible depolarization-induced interaction between these proteins, which might be involved in depolarization-induced activation of Go-proteins.Voltage-dependent activation of Go-proteins would imply a voltage-induced modulation of signal transduction cascades triggered by stimulation of Go-coupled-receptors. An example of reciprocal influence of membrane potential and receptor activity has been observed in muscarinic receptors (10Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9824-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent findings indicated a voltage-dependent modulation of the affinity of presynaptic muscarinic receptors (M2) providing an autoregulation of transmitter release (71Slutsky I. Parnas H. Parnas I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10 (suppl.) (abstr.): 174Google Scholar). Also, modulation of the oscillatory properties of entorhinal cortex layer II neurons has been attributed to a reciprocal effect of post-synaptic membrane potential and the activation of muscarinic (M1) receptors (72Klink R. Alonso A. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 1813-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to activation of ion channels by stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (1Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 73Ma J.Y. Li M. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This in turn may result feedback mechanisms, producing long term changes in the membrane potential.Because receptor stimulation induces activation of several receptor-coupled G-proteins (4Coulter S. Rodbell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5842-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), depolarization-induced activation of even a fraction of Go-proteins may affect the activity of other G-proteins, as well (10Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Only the DPI R enantiomer, which prevents the activation of VGSC (45Romey G. Quast U. Pauron D. Frelin C. Renaud J.F. Lazdunski M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), prevented both the depolarization-induced exchange of GDP for [α32P]GTPAA in Go-proteins (Figs. 7, A and B) and the depolarization-induced uncoupling of G-proteins from muscarinic receptors (Fig. 7C). This supports the assumption that depolarization-induced activation of VGSC may be involved in depolarization-induced activation of Go-proteins. This assumption was further supported by the efficient cross-linking of VGSC-α subunit with Gαo-proteins during depolarization (Figs. 8, A and C). In addition, GDP-bound Gαo-proteins most efficiently cross-linked with the α subunit of VGSC in isolated synaptoneurosomal membranes (Fig. 8C). Regarding the GTPase activity of Gαo-proteins (7Kleuss C. Raw A.S. Lee E. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9828-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), these findings may suggest repeated interactions between α subunit of VGSC and Gαo-proteins, as long as depolarization lasts (Fig. 8). Taken together, these findings support a possible depolarization-induced interaction between these proteins, which might be involved in depolarization-induced activation of Go-proteins. Voltage-dependent activation of Go-proteins would imply a voltage-induced modulation of signal transduction cascades triggered by stimulation of Go-coupled-receptors. An example of reciprocal influence of membrane potential and receptor activity has been observed in muscarinic receptors (10Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9824-9838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent findings indicated a voltage-dependent modulation of the affinity of presynaptic muscarinic receptors (M2) providing an autoregulation of transmitter release (71Slutsky I. Parnas H. Parnas I. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10 (suppl.) (abstr.): 174Google Scholar). Also, modulation of the oscillatory properties of entorhinal cortex layer II neurons has been attributed to a reciprocal effect of post-synaptic membrane potential and the activation of muscarinic (M1) receptors (72Klink R. Alonso A. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 1813-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to activation of ion channels by stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (1Gilman A.G. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 65-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 73Ma J.Y. Li M. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12351-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 74Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Wickman K. Clapham E.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30068-30074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), receptor stimulation may be modulated by activation of voltage-gated ion channels. This in turn may result feedback mechanisms, producing long term changes in the membrane potential. Because receptor stimulation induces activation of several receptor-coupled G-proteins (4Coulter S. Rodbell M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5842-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), depolarization-induced activation of even a fraction of Go-proteins may affect the activity of other G-proteins, as well (10Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2595-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cohen-Armon M. Sokolovsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12498-12505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby producing additional versatility in synaptic transmissions in the central nervous system.
