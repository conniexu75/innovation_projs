Interestingly, both acetylation and ubiquitination can modify the same lysine residues at the C terminus of p53, implicating a role of acetylation in the regulation of p53 stability. However, the direct effect of acetylation on Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 is still lacking because of technical difficulties. Here, we have developed a method to obtain pure acetylated p53 proteins from cells, and by using an in vitro purified system, we provide the direct evidence that acetylation of the C-terminal domain is sufficient to abrogate its ubiquitination by Mdm2. Importantly, even in the absence of DNA damage, acetylation of the p53 protein is capable of reducing the ubiquitination levels and extending its half-life in vivo. Moreover, we also show that acetylation of p53 can affect its ubiquitination through other mechanisms in addition to the site competition. This study has significant implications regarding a general mechanism by which protein acetylation modulates ubiquitination-dependent proteasome proteolysis.

The precise mechanism by which p53 is activated by cellular stress is not completely understood; it is generally thought to involve mainly post-translational modifications of p53, including ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and acetylation (1Appella E.

The acetylation of p53 can dramatically stimulate its sequence-specific DNA binding activity, possibly as a result of an acetylation-induced conformational change (6Gu W. Roeder R.G.

By developing site-specific acetylated p53 antibodies, CBP/p300-mediated acetylation of p53 was further confirmed in vivo by a number of studies (9Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5540-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, p53 can also be acetylated at Lys-320 by another HAT cofactor, p300/CBP-asssociated factor, although the in vivo functional consequence needs to be further elucidated (9Sakaguchi K.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Significantly, the steady-state levels of acetylated p53 are stimulated in response to various types of stress, indicating the important role of p53 acetylation in stress response (11Liu Y. Colosimo A.L. Yang X.J. Liao D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5540-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).By serving as a signal for specific cellular protein degradation, ubiquitination plays a critical role in physiological regulation of many cellular processes (13Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar, 14Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The ubiquitination of p53 was first discovered in papilloma virus-infected cells through the functions mediated by the viral E6 protein (15Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar); however, in normal cells, Mdm2 functions as an ubiquitin ligase and plays a major role in p53 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (16Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar, 17Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H.

Like in the case of acetylation, the Îµ-amino group of the substrate lysine residue is also the target for ubiquitination (13Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar, 14Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Significantly, recent studies have indicated that the lysine residues at the C-terminal domain of p53, five of which are the acetylation sites, play a critical role in Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (19Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 20Nakamura S. Roth J.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 8521-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increasing the levels of p53 acetylation with deacetylase inhibitors in the cell also prevents p53 from degradationin vivo (11Liu Y. Colosimo A.L. Yang X.J. Liao D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5540-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that acetylation of p53 may directly regulate its ubiquitination levelsin vivo. However, thus far, there is no direct evidence regarding how p53 acetylation affects its ubiquitination, mainly because of the technical difficulties. In this study, we have developed several assays to establish an important mechanism that p53 acetylation is directly involved in the regulation of its ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis induced by Mdm2.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOne of the major obstacles in elucidating the precise role of acetylation in the regulation of protein function is obtaining the pure acetylated form. Since the acetylated non-histone proteins are inseparable from the unacetylated forms on the regular SDS-PAGE gel, thus far, most of the functional studies on newly identified acetylated substrates, including p53, are derived from the âacetylated proteinsâ without any quantitative analysis of their contents (6Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, 7Kouzarides T.

Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 9Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 10Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell.

Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very difficult to provide consistent results about the functional differences between the âunacetylated formâ and the âacetylated formâ of these proteins as the acetylated form may be heavily contaminated with the unacetylated form. To provide direct evidence that acetylation of p53 can modulate its ubiquitination by Mdm2, we had to obtain the pure form of acetylated p53 from cells. Interestingly, our preliminary data indicated that the acetylated p53 protein reacts poorly to PAb421, one of the p53 antibodies, although it can be recognized perfectly well by several other p53 antibodies including DO-1 (data not shown, also see Fig. 1). Since the PAb421 antibody was raised specifically against the C-terminal domain of p53, overlapping with the sites for acetylation (Fig. 1 a), it is very likely that acetylation of the C-terminal domain may prevent p53 from binding to the PAb421 antibody. This piece of information provided an important clue, that the unacetylated p53 form can be specifically removed from the acetylated p53 fractions through the differential bindings with the PAb421 antibody, for purification of the acetylated p53 form.Thus, we applied a two-step strategy to purify the pure form of acetylated p53 from human cells. First, we purified total p53 proteins from cell extracts, and second, we isolated the acetylated p53 from the total p53 proteins by the PAb421 antibody column (Fig. 1 b). As indicated in Fig. 1 c, the acetylation levels of p53 were enhanced significantly when the FLAG-tagged p53 protein was coexpressed with p300 in H1299 cells (lane 2 versus lane 1), and these transfected cells provided a good resource for the purification of acetylated p53 proteins. By using the M2/FLAG column, the total p53 proteins were purified from these cell extracts, but heavily contaminated with unacetylated p53 proteins (data not shown). Then, we loaded them on the PAb421 antibody column to deplete the unacetylated form of p53 (Fig. 1 b), and the purified acetylated p53 proteins were finally tested for their purities. As shown in Fig. 1 d, the purified acetylated p53 was easily detected by the acetylated p53-specific antibody (lane 2 versus lane 1, upper panel). Both acetylated and unacetylated forms of p53 reacted equally well to the DO-1 antibody (lane 2 versus lane 1, middle panel), which is against the N-terminal domain of p53 (Fig. 1 a). Significantly, the purified acetylated p53 protein could not be detected by the PAb421 antibody at all (lane 2 versus lane 1, lower panel). These data indicate that acetylation of the p53 protein by p300 can block the recognition site for the PAb421 antibody. More importantly, we have obtained the pure form of acetylated p53 from cells without obvious contamination from unacetylated p53 proteins.To provide the direct evidence that acetylation of p53 affects its ubiquitination, we set up a reconstitution system for p53 ubiquitination by Mdm2. As indicated in Fig. 2 a, the E2 (GST-UbcH5c) and E3 (GST-Mdm2) were expressed in bacteria as GST fusion proteins and purified to near homogeneity (lanes 5 and 3), ubiquitin was expressed as a His-tagged protein and obtained by a similar manner (lane 7), and the E1 was purchased as a purified protein (lane 2). The highly purified in vitro system was used in this assay to avoid any possible indirect effect by other factors on p53 ubiquitination. To define the purified system for p53 ubiquitination, we first tested whether all purified components can support Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination of an unmodified form of p53 in vitro. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2 b, the bacteria-produced p53 protein was specifically ubiquitinated only in the presence of Mdm2 (lane 5). Importantly, as shown in Fig. 2 c, the total p53 protein purified from human cells (Fig. 1), like the bacteria produced p53 protein, was strongly ubiquitinated (lane 2); however, the same amount of the acetylated p53 protein was barely ubiquitinated by Mdm2 under the same conditions (lane 4 versus lane 2). These results demonstrate directly that acetylation of p53 strongly inhibits its ubiquitination mediated by Mdm2.Figure 2Acetylation of p53 inhibits its ubiquitination by Mdm2 in vitro. a, colloidal blue staining of the purified components for in vitro ubiquitination assays. b, Western blot analysis of the in vitro ubiquitination reactions mediated by Mdm2 with the DO-1 monoclonal antibody.

The ubiquitination reactions were performed in the presence of Mdm2 (lanes 2 and 4) or in the absence of Mdm2 as controls (lanes 1 and 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further confirm the above findings, we searched for an acetylation-mimicking mutant for p53. Interestingly, it was previously reported that the histone H4 protein with the Lys â Gln mutation at the H4 acetylation site functionally behaved as the acetylated form to prevent Sir3p from binding H4 and spreading to form heterochromatin in yeast (26Hecht A. Laroche T. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Gasser S.M. Grunstein M. Cell. 1995; 80: 583-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In fact, a Lys â Gln mutation can mimic the acetylated state of lysine (K) mainly because of the structure similarity between the Gln (Q) residue and the acetylated-lysine residue (Fig. 3 a). Thus, a p53(K-Q) mutant, in which all five acetylation sites (Lys-370, Lys-371, Lys-372, Lys-381, Lys-382, see Ref. 6Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar) were replaced by the glutamine residues, may mimic the acetylated form of p53. Interestingly, several studies have shown that the Lys â Arg mutation at the C-terminal acetylation sites only partially block Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of the whole p53 polypeptide (18Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 19Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), indicating that there are additional lysine residues that can be ubiquitinated by Mdm2. Thus, the mechanism by which acetylation of p53 inhibits its ubiquitination by Mdm2 may contain two folds. First, acetylation of the p53 C-terminal domain blocks the Îµ-amino group of these acetylated lysine residues for ubiquitination, and second, acetylation of p53 may also induce protein conformation change to inhibit the ubiquitination of additional lysine residues that are not the acetylation targets. To test the above hypothesis, we examined whether the Lys â Gln mutation can effectively inhibit Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of the whole p53 protein in vitro. Since the Lys â Arg mutation only eliminates the Îµ-amino group of these acetylation sites for ubiquitination without a neutralization of positive charges, we included a p53(K-R) mutant in the same assay as a comparison, in which the five acetylation sites were replaced by arginine residues (Fig. 3 b).Figure 3Regulation of Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 in vitro by the Lys â Gln mutation versusLys â Arg mutation on the acetylation sites. a, schematic representation of the similarities between the acetylated lysine residue and the glutamine residue. b, schematic representation of the p53(K-Q) mutant and p53(K-R) mutant. c, in vitro ubiquitination of the wild type p53 and p53 mutant proteins by Mdm2. The35S-labeled wild type p53 protein (lanes 1 and2) or p53(K-Q) mutant protein (lanes 3 and4) or p53(K-R) mutant protein (lanes 5 and6) were differentially ubiquitinated by Mdm2 in vitro (lanes 2, 4, and 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For better quantitative analysis of the ubiquitination activities, we used the 35S-labeled, in vitro translated p53 proteins as substrates for the ubiquitination assay. Thus, similar reactions as described above (Fig. 2 b) were set up by incubating labeled p53 substrates, E1, E2 (GST-UbcH5c), E3 (GST-Mdm2), and ubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 3 c, the wild type p53 protein was strongly ubiquitinated by Mdm2 (lane 2 versus lane 1), whereas the p53(K-R) mutant protein had a significant, but only partial, reduction on Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination (â¼60% decrease) (lane 6 versus lane 2), consistent with the previously published results (18Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar, 19Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Strikingly, however, the Lys â Gln mutation on the same lysine residues induced a much stronger resistance to Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination, and the ubiquitination levels produced by the p53(K-Q) mutant protein were almost undetectable under the same conditions (lane 4). These results clearly demonstrate a much more effective inhibitory effect on Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination by the Lys â Gln mutation than the effect by the Lys â Arg mutation of these acetylation sites of p53. Based on the facts that the Lys â Gln mutation mimics the acetylated form of the lysine residue, whereas the Lys â Arg mutation only eliminates the Îµ-amino group of the acetylation sites for ubiquitination, our data further suggest that acetylation of p53, in addition to blocking the ubiquitination sites of these acetylated lysine residues, may also inhibit Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of other lysine residues, possibly through inducing a protein conformational change.To examine the role of acetylation in the regulation of p53 ubiquitination in vivo, we tested the effect of acetylation on ubiquitination levels of endogenous p53 proteins. The acetylated p53 protein is much more easily obtained from the cells treated with the DNA damage reagents; however, to avoid other factors (e.g.p53 phosphorylation) that may also be involved in p53 stabilization under the DNA damage conditions (12Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), we chose to purify the acetylated form of endogenous p53 proteins from unstressed cells. As indicated in Fig. 4 a, high levels of ubiquitinated p53 proteins were present in the total p53 protein prepared from human Burkitt lymphoma cells (BL2) by immunoprecipitations with a p53 antibody against the full-length protein (lane 2). In contrast, the ubiquitinated p53 was almost undetectable in the acetylated form of the endogenous p53 protein (lane 1, Fig. 4 a), which was purified by immunoprecipitations with the antiacetylated p53-specific antibody from the same cells (see âExperimental Proceduresâ). Furthermore, we also examined the effect of acetylation on the half-life of p53in vivo. As indicated in Fig. 4 b, the half-life of the total p53 protein was less than 30 min. Strikingly, the acetylated form of p53, which constitutes only a very small portion of the total p53 protein in unstressed cells, appeared very stable; the half-life of the acetylated p53 was more than 2 h (Fig. 4 c). The above results demonstrate that acetylation of p53 can abrogate its ubiquitination and stabilize the p53 protein under physiological conditions.Figure 4The effect of acetylation on ubiquitination and stability of endogenous p53 in human cells (BL2). a, Western blot analysis of the ubiquitination levels of acetylated p53 and total p53 proteins immunoprecipitated from human BL2 cells. b, the half-life of the endogenous p53 protein (Total-p53).

More importantly, we have also provided further evidence elucidating a novel mechanism for acetylation-induced effects on p53 ubiquitination: acetylation of p53 not only blocks the Îµ-amino group of the acetylated lysine residues for ubiquitination, but also attenuates Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of other unacetylated lysine residues, possibly through inducing a protein conformational change. Stabilization of p53 is critical for its effects on cell growth repression and apoptosis (1Appella E. Anderson C.W. Pathol. Biol. (Paris). 2000; 48: 227-245PubMed Google Scholar, 2Prives C.

It is generally thought that p53 is phosphorylated at multiple sites (mainly Ser-15 or Ser-20) and that these phosphorylation events promote p53 stabilization by preventing the binding with Mdm2 and rendering p53 more resistant to Mdm2-mediated degradation (28Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 29Maya R. Balass M. Kim S.T. Shkedy D. Leal J.F. Shifman O. Moas M. Buschmann T. Ronai Z. Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Katzir E. Oren M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1067-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, several groups recently reported that mutations of these phosphorylation sites on p53 do not significantly inhibit the ability of DNA damage to stabilize p53 (30Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1751-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 31Blattner C. Tobiasch E. Litfen M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P.

Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some genotoxic drugs, such as actinomycin D, can stabilize p53 without provoking either Ser-15 or Ser-20 phosphorylation (33Ashcroft M. Taya Y. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that p53 can be stabilized without the modification of its N-terminal domain by phosphorylation. Our findings clearly support such notion by providing an alternative mechanism by which p53 can be stabilized through its acetylation.Acetylation, which modifies the lysine residue of target proteins including histone and non-histone proteins, is now recognized as an important regulatory step in transcriptional regulation (6Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, 7Kouzarides T.

A large number of the non-histone transcriptional factors have been demonstrated as bona fide substrates for acetyltransferases, suggesting that acetylation may represent another type of general protein modifications involved in functional regulation of transcriptional factors. Interestingly, both acetylation and ubiquitination modify the Îµ-amino group of the substrate lysine residues. Moreover, many of these identified acetylated substrates are involved in ubiquitination-dependent proteasome proteolysis, and several identified acetylation lysine residues are also potential ubiquitination sites (7Kouzarides T.

This is reported to occur through the transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, similar to other G protein-coupled receptors. Here, we define the signaling events that result in EGFR and ERK activation. E2-stimulated ERK required ER in breast cancer and endothelial cells and was substantially prevented by expression of a dominant negative EGFR or by tyrphostin AG1478, a specific inhibitor for EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. Transactivation/phosphorylation of EGFR by E2 was dependent on the rapid liberation of heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF) from cultured MCF-7 cells and was blocked by antibodies to this ligand for EGFR. Expression of dominant negative mini-genes for GÎ±q and GÎ±i blocked E2-induced, EGFR-dependent ERK activation, and GÎ²Î³ also contributed. G protein activation led to activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9. This resulted from Src-induced MMP activation, implicated using PP2 (Src family kinase inhibitor) or the expression of a dominant negative Src protein. Antisense oligonucleotides to MMP-2 and MMP-9 or ICI 182780 (ER antagonist) each prevented E2-induced HB-EGF liberation and ERK activation. E2 also induced AKT up-regulation in MCF-7 cells and p38Î² MAP kinase activity in endothelial cells, blocked by an MMP inhibitor, GM6001, and tyrphostin AG1478. Targeting of only the E domain of ERÎ± to the plasma membrane resulted in MMP activation and EGFR transactivation. Thus, specific G proteins mediate the ability of E2 to activate MMP-2 and MMP-9 via Src. This leads to HB-EGF transactivation of EGFR and signaling to multiple kinase cascades in several target cells for E2. The E domain is sufficient to enact these events, defining additional details of the important cross-talk between membrane ER and EGFR in breast cancer.

Traditionally, steroid hormone action was exclusively attributed to the binding of nuclear receptors and the subsequent transactivation of target genes that led to cell biological effects (1Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2699) Google Scholar). More recently, it has become clear that steroids rapidly act on cells, in seconds to minutes, effects that are classified as ânongenomicâ (reviewed in Ref. 2Falkenstein E. Wehling M. Eur. J.

For estrogen, this has been attributed in most cells to binding a population of receptors that exists within caveolar rafts and other domains in the plasma membrane (3Kim H.P. Lee J.Y. Jeong J.K.

What is the nature of the membrane ER, and how does it enact signal transduction? Current evidence favors the idea that the membrane and nuclear ER are the same protein. Antibodies directed against many epitopes of the classical ERÎ± receptor identify membrane ER by immunocytochemistry (18Pappas T.C. Gametchu B. Yannariello-Brown J. Collins T.J. Watson C.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Expression of antisense DNA to the ânuclearâ ER also abrogates the detectable expression of membrane ER in cells containing endogenous receptor (19Norfleet A.M. Thomas M.L. Gametchu B. Watson C.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3805-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In CHO cells, expression of a single cDNA for either ERÎ± or ERÎ² produces both membrane and nuclear receptor populations and results in E2 activation of signal transduction from the membrane (6Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). In many cell types, endogenous membrane ER have been identified (15Morey A.K. Pedram A. Razandi M. Prins B.A., Hu, R.-M. Biesiada E. Levin E.R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 3330-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Pappas T.C. Gametchu B. Yannariello-Brown J.

A. 2000; 97: 5930-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and appear to reflect the localization of receptors that also have the capacity to translocate to the nucleus. The structural aspects of the membrane ER that allow it to activate signaling molecules are not well defined. Assuming that the sequence of the nuclear receptor is the same as the membrane ER, there is no catalytic or kinase sequence inherent to the structure. Recent evidence favors the idea that the E domain of the membrane ER is essential (and perhaps sufficient) for activation of the ERK cascade (5Razandi M., Oh, P. Pedram A. Schnitzer J. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), leading to cell survival (17Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the AF-1 domain of ERÎ± has been identified to interact with the adapter protein, Shc, in whole cell homogenates (21Song R.X. McPherson R.A. Adam L. Bao Y. Shupnik M. Kumar R. Santen R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thus, the membrane ER acts similarly to many other GPCR that also lack catalytic or kinase domains yet signal to important events in cell biology. As a GPCR, the membrane ER associates with and activates several G proteins. In transfected CHO cells, membrane ERÎ± or ERÎ² co-precipitates with and activates GÎ±s and GÎ±q proteins (6Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). This leads to the expected downstream signaling to cAMP and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation, signaling that has been shown in cells expressing endogenous ER (22Aronica S.M. Kraus W.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8517-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar,23Lieberherr M. Grosse B. Kachkache M. Balsan S. J. Bone Min. Res. 1993; 8: 1365-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In EC, endogenous membrane ER physically associates with GÎ±i and activate endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; this probably takes place within caveolae (7Wyckoff M.H. Chambliss K.L. Mineo C. Yuhanna I.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Mumby S.M. Shaul P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27071-27076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been proposed in breast cancer cells that E2/ER transactivates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), leading to the downstream signaling to ERK activation (24Filardo E.J. Quinn J.A. Frackelton A.R., Jr. Bland K.I. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 70-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 25Filardo E.J. Quinn J.A. Bland K.I. Frackelton A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This occurs through the activation of GÎ²Î³, the liberation of heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), which results in the binding and activation of the EGFR, and the subsequent stimulation of the ERK signaling cascade. In some of these respects, the membrane ER acts similarly to a wide range of GPCR (26Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). However, it was further proposed in breast cancer cells that E2 in some undefined way activates the orphan GPCR, GPR30, to stimulate signaling, and this interaction does not require ER (25Filardo E.J. Quinn J.A. Bland K.I. Frackelton A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1649-1660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These latter data are not in concert with many studies from other laboratories, indicating that E2 requires an ER for signaling from the membrane in various cell types (5Razandi M., Oh, P. Pedram A. Schnitzer J. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 6Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol.

The utilization of EGFR by E2/ER to signal results from a linked series of events involving multiple upstream molecules, only some of which have been defined. For instance, we do not know the range of G proteins that can be activated to cross-talk to EGFR activation, and it is not clear what signals immediately downstream of G proteins are important. Src participates in the transactivation of EGFR in response to other GPCR ligands and is probably upstream of HB-EGF shedding (29Pierce K.L. Tohgo A. Ahn S. Field M.E. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 22: 23155-23160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but its exact role and requirement for ER signaling is unclear. Furthermore, although matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation is required for HB-EGF liberation (and subsequent EGFR activation), the identity of the required MMP(s) is mainly undefined, especially as regards ER signaling. These issues are addressed in the studies described here. Finally, much of the interaction between GPCRs and EGFR has examined ERK activation. Thus, we sought additional signaling molecules in several cell types and the structural requirements within ER that utilize this interactive mechanism following endogenous ER ligation by E2. Antibodies and substrate for kinase activation/activity were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PD 98059 was a generous gift from Dr. Alan Saltiel (Parke-Davis). LipofectAMINE was from Invitrogen. Primary cultures of bovine aortic EC were prepared and used as previously described (30Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26722-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In transfection studies, EC were generally used in passages 4 and 5, based upon the previous observation that this greatly increases the transfection efficiency of these cells. Breast cancer cell lines were obtained from ATCC. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 or RPMI 1640 with serum until 48 h prior to experimentation, when they were placed in serum-free conditions and in medium without phenol red. Gelatin was from Sigma, and kinase substrates were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) or Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PP2, Src family kinase inhibitor, and GM6001, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). For ERK or p38Î² activity assays, the cells were synchronized for 24 h in serum- and growth factor-free medium. The cells were then exposed to E2 for 8 (ERK) or 15 (p38) minutes, with or without additional substances, as previously described (30Pedram A. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26722-26728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 33Razandi M. Pedram A. Levin E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38540-38546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed, and lysate was immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose conjugated to antiserum for p38 or ERK. Immunoprecipitated kinases were washed and then added to the proteins ATF-2 (for p38) or myelin basic protein (for ERK) for in vitro kinase assays. This was followed by SDS-PAGE separation and autoradiography/laser densitometry. In addition, the E2-induced phosphorylation of AKT kinases at 10 min was determined to assess activation. Cultured cell lysates were pelleted and dissolved in SDS sample buffer, boiled, separated, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphorylated kinase proteins were detected using phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz) and the ECL Western blot kit (Amersham Biosciences). Equal samples from the cells were also immunoprecipitated, and immunoblots of the precipitated kinase protein from each experimental condition were determined to show equal gel loading. All of the experiments were repeated two or three times. MCF-7, HCC-1569, ZR-75â1, or bovine aortic endothelial cells (passages 4 and 5) were grown to 40â50% confluence and then transiently transfected with 1.5 Î¼g (each well of 6-well plates) or 10 Î¼g of fusion plasmid DNA (100-mm dishes). Plasmids included wild type mouse ERÎ± (31Couse J.F. Curtis S.W. Washburn T.F. Lindzey J. Golding T.S. Lubahn D.B. Smithies O. Korach K.S. Mol.

Hamm H.E. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated with liposome-DNA complexes at 37 Â°C for 5 h, followed by overnight recovery in culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 24 h of synchronization in serum-free medium, and then treatment with E2 with or without other substances. MMP activity, as secreted into the medium of cultured MCF-7 cells, was analyzed by substrate gel electrophoresis (zymography). The cells were synchronized in serum-free medium for 24 h and then incubated in medium with or without 10 nm estrogen for 2 min at 37 Â°C in a CO2incubator. The cell medium was removed, concentrated 20-fold by ultrafiltration, and mixed with native gel sample buffer (Bio-Rad), and the proteins were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% gel co-polymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma). Active MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Calbiochem) was loaded into additional lanes on the gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h and incubated for16 h at 37 Â°C (in 0.05m Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3). The gel was stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue and destained in 10% acetic acid, 10% propanol. The study was repeated twice. Gelatinolytic activity appears as a clear band on a blue background. For the fluorescent substrate assay, MCF-7 cells were synchronized for 24 h and then incubated without or with 10 nm estrogen for 2 min. The incubation medium was concentrated 10-fold, and 1 ml of assay buffer (100 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 nm NaCl2) containing 5 Î¼m of the Mca-Pro-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2substrate for MMP-2/MMP-9 was added and then incubated at 37 Â°C for 3 h. Excitation at 328 nm and emission at 393 nm were determined in a fluorimeter. To implicate MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the shedding of HB-EGF, the cells were incubated with antisense (ASO) or scrambled antisense (MSO) with the same base composition for each of the two MMPs. The oligonucleotides were: MMP-2, ASO, CCGGGCCATTAGCGCCTCCAT, and MSO, TCACCGCGGTACGCATGCCCT; and MMP-9, ASO, CAGGGGCTGCCAGAGGCTCAT, and MSO, GCGAGCTAGGACTGTGCAGCC. The oligonucleotides were added with LipofectAMINE for 5 h, and the cells were recovered overnight and synchronized in the absence of serum for 12 h. Transfection efficiency exceeded 60%, based upon co-expression of PEGFPc2. Western blot studies were carried out to confirm the efficacy of the ASO but not the MSO to inhibit specific protein production. Studies of E2-induced signaling were then carried out in cells expressing the various oligonucleotides. Subconfluent, transfected, or nontransfected cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells were serum-deprived for 24 h and then incubated under various conditions for 10 min with inhibitors followed by 10 min of treatment with stimulants. This included several 17-Î²-E2 concentrations, ICI 182780 (1 Î¼m), and 100 nm GM6001, a broad MMP inhibitor. The cells were lysed, and antibodies to HB-EGF or EGFR (tyrosine 1138) (1:50 dilution) were conjugated to Sepharose beads and then added to the cell lysate for 2 h at 4 Â°C. After pelleting and washing, the samples were electrophoretically separated on a 7% SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted. Detection utilized the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). We first established that E2 required both the presence of an ER and the activation of EGFR to signal to ERK. HCC-1569 cells lack ER, and the cells did not respond to E2 with ERK activation (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). When ERÎ± was expressed in these cells, 17-Î²-E2 (lane 4), but not 17-Î±-E2 (lane 8), was capable of activating ERK, and this was substantially blocked by the ER antagonist, ICI182780 (lane 5). As a positive control, these cells express the EGFR and appropriately respond to EGF (lane 7). The requirement of ER is similar to our previous findings in CHO-K1 cells (6Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). We then asked whether E2 activation of ERK depends upon EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. We examined this in MCF-7 and ZR-75â1 breast cancer cells and EC (all with ER). Tyrphostin AG1478, specifically directed against the EGFR tyrosine kinase function, prevented EGFR-induced ERK activation in both MCF-7 and ZR-75â1 cells (Fig. 1 B, left andcenter panels). Importantly, tyrphostin AG1478 also substantially prevented the ability of E2 to activate ERK in the three cell types (Fig. 1 B, all panels, lanes 2 versus lanes 6). To corroborate this finding, we expressed a dominant negative EGFR (31Couse J.F. Curtis S.W. Washburn T.F. Lindzey J. Golding T.S. Lubahn D.B. Smithies O. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1441-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in MCF-7 cells, and E2 was much less effective in stimulating this MAP kinase, compared with cells expressing the empty vector (control) (Fig. 1 C). What ligand for EGFR is involved in the transactivation of this receptor by E2? Although there are many members of the EGF family that can bind the EGFR, HB-EGF has often been implicated in the setting of GPCR signaling via this receptor (36Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). To examine this, we first determined whether E2 could stimulate the secretion of HB-EGF, determined by Western blot. As seen in Fig. 2 A, E2 dose-responsively induced a significant enhancement of HB-EGF shedding/secretion from the MCF-7 cells after 3 min of incubation. This was prevented by ICI182780 and by GM6001, an MMP inhibitor. To determine that HB-EGF was the important ligand for EGFR signaling to ERK, we incubated the MCF-7 cells with 10 nm E2, in the presence or absence of antibody to HB-EGF. In the setting of this added antibody, E2 could not significantly activate ERK (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, antibody to TGFÎ±-1, another ligand for the EGFR, had no effect on E2-induced ERK, and the antibodies by themselves did not affect basal ERK activity. Similarly, antibody to HB-EGF (but not to TGFÎ±-1) prevented E2-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 2 C). Identical findings were determined from EC incubated with E2 (data not shown). These results support the interactions of secreted HB-EGF with EGFR, leading to ERK activation in breast cancer and vascular cells. The data also support ER-mediated, MMP-dependent release of HB-EGF. Current evidence supports the idea that GPCRs activate MMP activity, thereby liberating HB-EGF from the cell matrix, leading to the transactivation of the EGFR (36Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar, 37Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Therefore, MMP activation represents the step immediately upstream of HB-EGF liberation. In many cell paradigms, including E2 action, the precise MMP(s) activated by GPCR signaling are unknown. We therefore showed that E2 activates MMP activity by demonstrating that the incubation medium from MCF-7 cells treated with E2 for 2 min induces the cleavage of substrate specific for MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, substrate specific for MMP-13 or MMP-3 was not cleaved by the E2-treated cell medium (data not shown), even though breast cancer cells produce these proteolytic enzymes. We then sought to further identify the MMPs by carrying out gelatin zymography. E2 treatment of the cultured MCF-7 cells for 2 min led to the increased secretion and activation of MMP-2 and -9 (Fig. 3 B, first andsecond lanes). To corroborate the identify of the digested gelatin band activities, active MMPs (Calbiochem) were also run in parallel on a separate gel (data not shown). Functionally, activation of MMP activity was necessary for E2-induced ERK. This was shown in that the MMP inhibitor completely reversed the ability of E2 to activate ERK in both MCF-7 and ZR-75â1 cells (Fig. 3 C,left and right panels). This compound did not affect EGF-induced ERK activation, supporting the idea that MMP-related events occur upstream to EGFR activation in this pathway. Although E2 activates these two MMPs, it is not clear that they are responsible for E2-induced HB-EGF shedding. We therefore used ASO or MSO, with the latter comprised of the same base composition as the ASO for MMP-2 and MMP-9, and expressed them in MCF-7 cells. First, we validated the constructs by showing that the ASO (but not the MSO) for MMP-2 or MMP-9 inhibited the respective protein production in a dose-related manner (Fig. 4 A,left panel). Similarly, we validated the function of the MMP-2 or MMP-9 to specifically inhibit only the intended protein target (Fig. 4 A, right panel). Using these ASO and MSO, we next determined whether MMP-2 and MMP-9 each contributed to HB-EGF shedding and ERK activation (Fig. 4, B and C). Each ASO significantly down-regulated E2-induced HB-EGF liberation, and expressing the ASO to both MMPs completely blocked this E2 action. The ASO to MMP-2 almost completely prevented the ability of E2 to activate ERK in MCF-7 cells, whereas the ASO to MMP-9 was also substantially able to prevent this signaling; neither MSO had any effect, an"

Steady state kinetics measurements exhibit mixed type inhibition with K(i) and K(i)' values of 1.2 +/- 0.05 x 10(-10) m and 9 +/- 0.05 x 10(-10) m, respectively. Fluorescence-monitored titration experiments showed that TEI-6720 bound very tightly to both the active and the inactive desulfo-form of the enzyme. The dissociation constant determined for the desulfo-form was 2 +/- 0.03 x 10(-9) m; for the active form, the corresponding number was too low to allow accurate measurements. The crystal structure of the active sulfo-form of milk xanthine dehydrogenase complexed with TEI-6720 and determined at 2.8-A resolution revealed the inhibitor molecule bound in a long, narrow channel leading to the molybdenum-pterin active site of the enzyme. It filled up most of the channel and the immediate environment of the cofactor, very effectively inhibiting the activity of the enzyme through the prevention of substrate binding. Although the inhibitor did not directly coordinate to the molybdenum ion, numerous hydrogen bonds as well as hydrophobic interactions with the protein matrix were observed, most of which are also used in substrate recognition."

This group is characterized by highly conserved DNA and ligand binding domains and includes the functionally diverse estrogen, progesterone, peroxisome proliferator-activated, constitutive androstane, retinoic acid, vitamin D, and thyroid hormone receptors. A growing body of evidence indicates that an important function fulfilled by some members of the nuclear receptor superfamily is to contribute to the homeostatic control of lipid metabolism. In particular, LXR (NR1H3),1 the liver oxysterol-activated receptor (2Peet D.J. Turley S.D., Ma, W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Cross-talk between LXR feed-forward and FXR feed-back regulation, particularly of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene encoding cholesterol 7Î±-hydroxylase (CYP7Î1), the rate-limiting enzyme of the classic BA biosynthetic pathway, permits fine-tuning of hepatic cholesterol homeostasis (6Repa J.J.

The role of LXR as a sterol sensor coordinating the expression of genes involved in various aspects of sterol homeostasis has been firmly established by the use of a synthetic LXR agonist (T0901317) and LXRÎ±Î²-knockout mice. T0901317 induces the intestinal expression of ABCA1 and concomitantly decreases the absorption of cholesterol in wild-type but not in LXRÎ±Î² knockout mice (15Repa J.J. Turley S.D. Lobaccaro J.A.

T0901317 also regulates the expression of two additional ABC transporters, ABCG5 and ABCG8, responsible for the exclusion of dietary sterols others than cholesterol from absorption by the enterocyte (16Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A., Yu, L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2000; 290: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Characterization ofFXR knockout mice has firmly established the critical role for this receptor in bile acid homeostasis by virtue of its role as an intracellular bile acid sensor (17Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). This function is achieved in large measure through the regulation of genes involved in BA transport and biosynthesis. These include CYP7A1, the liver canalicular, the bile salt export pump (BSEP-ABCB11), the ileal bile acid binding protein (I-BABP), the hepatic basolateral sodium taurocholate co-transporter protein (NTCP), and the sterol 12Î±-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), which controls the ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid in the bile (18Bjorkhem I. Eggertsen G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, although FXR is a key regulator of BA homeostasis, its physiological role in the overall metabolism of cholesterol remains to be established. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the role of FXR as a regulator of cholesterol homeostasis and to gain mechanistic insight into the means by which this is achieved. FXR(â/â) mice (17Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J.

Mice were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility under a standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were fed a standard rodent chow (AIN-93G) and water ad libitum. For some experiments, mice were fed a standard chow diet supplemented with 0.4% (w/w) cholic acid (Bioserv, Frenchtown, NJ). For tissue collection, mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. The livers and ilea were quickly removed, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at â80 Â°C until use. All protocols and procedures were reviewed and approved by the National Institutes of Health animal care and use committee. Plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), as well as free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipids (Wako, Osaka, Japan) were measured in a 12-Î¼l aliquot of plasma using commercial kits and the Hitachi 911 automated chemistry analyzer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Lipoproteins from pooled plasma samples (100 Î¼l) were separated by FPLC using two Superose 6HR 10/30 columns in series (AmershamBiosciences, Piscataway, NJ). High density lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (19Asztalos B.F. Sloop C.H. Wong L. Roheim P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Plasma apoB was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (20Vaisman B.L. Lambert G. Amar M. Joyce C. Ito T. Shamburek R.D.

Plasma LCAT activity measurements were performed as previously described (21Chen C.H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 680-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Post-heparin plasma LPL and (HL) activities were assayed in triplicate using 14C-labeled triolein substrate in 5 and 1 m NaCl as previously described (22Iverius P.H. Brunzell J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: E107-E114PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), quantitated by optical densitometry at 260 nm, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel containing 0.22 m formaldehyde in 20 mm MOPS, 8 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.0). After separation, the RNA was transferred to Immobilon-Ny+ transfer membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by downward capillary transfer in the presence of 20Ã SSC buffer (3 m NaCl, 0.3m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and fixed by UV cross-linking. Full-length cDNA probes were prepared by reverse transcription-PCR from liver total RNA and 32P-labeled by the random primer method using Prime-it RT labeling beads (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Probe hybridization was carried out overnight at 65 Â°C in PerfectHyb Plus hybridization buffer (Sigma). Washes (three at 30 min each) were performed at 65 Â°C using 2Ã SSC/0.5% SDS as the buffer. Blots were exposed to phosphorimaging screens and were visualized using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences, Sunnyvale, CA). HDL (1.063 < d< 1.21) from control C57BL mice were labeled with [3H]cholesterylpalmityl ether (CEt) or with125I-apoA-I and 131I-apoA-II as previously described (23Lambert G. Amar M.J. Martin P.

The radioactivity of 3H was quantitated in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR liquid scintillation counter and that of125I/131I was measured using a Cobra Î³-counter (Packard, Downers Grove, IL; for all). [3H]CEt-labeled HDL or125I-apoA-I/131I-apoA-II-labeled HDL was injected into the exposed saphenous veins of anesthetized mice (23Lambert G. Amar M.J. Martin P. Fruchart-Najib J. Foger B.

Blood samples were collected in heparinized capillary tubes (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA) from the retro-orbital plexus. The plasma disappearance curves were generated by dividing the plasma radioactivity at each time point by the radioactivity of 1-min time point. FCR were determined from the area under the curves using a multiexponential curve-fitting technique on the SAAM program (24Shamburek R.D. Pentchev P.G. Zech L.A. Blanchette-Mackie J. Carstea E.D.

After the 13-h blood sample was collected, mice injected with [3H]CEt-HDL were exsanguinated (1.2 ml of blood) and euthanized. Liver, adrenals, testis, heart, lungs, kidneys, and spleen were harvested. CEt was extracted in 20 volumes of chloroform-methanol, 2:1 (v/v) (34Natarajan R. Ghosh S. Grogan W.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Phases were separated by the addition of water, and aliquots of the lower organic phase were counted. Mean recoveries at 13 h were greater than 90% of the injected dose (plasma volume: 3.16% of body weight). Mouse liver membrane proteins were purified as previously described (25Lambert G. Sakai N.

Densitometric scanning was performed using the Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI. Mice were injected with Tyloxapol (Sigma) (500 Î¼g/g body weight). Plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)/chylomicron-TG clearance in mice is completely inhibited under these conditions. Blood samples were taken from each mouse at 0, 30, 90, and 150 min after injection (26Boisfer E. Lambert G. Atger V. Tran N.Q. Pastier D. Benetollo C. Trottier J.F. Beaucamps I. Antonucci M.

The accumulation of newly synthesized VLDL/chylomicron-TG was measured in plasma aliquots and ascertained by FPLC. Mice were fasted for 4 h, weighed, and anesthetized, and their abdominal cavities opened under sterile conditions. The cystic duct was ligated and the common bile duct was cannulated through the sphincter of Oddi (27Wang D.Q. Lammert F. Cohen D.E. Paigen B. Carey M.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G751-G760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a PE-10 catheter (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD). The hepatic bile was collected by gravity for 45 min. Biliary cholesterol, phospholipids, and BAs (Sigma diagnostic kit) were measured immediately after bile collection. Intestinal cholesterol absorption was determined by a modification of the dual isotope plasma ratio method (28Turley S.D. Herndon M.W. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 328-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anesthetized non-fasted mice were injected intravenously with 2.5 Î¼Ci of [3H]cholesterol dissolved in 100 Î¼l of Intralipid. The animals were given 1 Î¼Ci of [14C]cholesterol dissolved in 150 Î¼l of medium chain TG oil by gavage. After 72 h, mice were bled and plasma aliquots (100 Î¼l) were counted for 3H and 14C. Cholesterol absorption was calculated as: % cholesterol absorption = (% of gavage dose Ã· % of intravenous dose) Ã 100. Values are reported as mean Â± S.E. Comparisons between groups of mice were made using the Student'st test for independent samples (two-tailed). Previously, we reported that FXR(â/â) mice maintained on a regular chow diet exhibit profound hyperlipidemia (17Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the role of FXR in cholesterol and lipoprotein homeostasis, plasma lipid concentrations were determined and the lipoprotein profile of non-fasting wild-type and FXR(â/â) mice was compared using gel filtration (FPLC) analysis. Compared with wild-type mice,FXR(â/â) mice had 2-fold higher plasma total cholesterol, cholesterol ester (CE) and FC concentrations (TableI). Based upon this FPLC profile, it was evident that these increases of plasma cholesterol were primarily due to increased quantities of VLDL, low density lipoprotein (LDL), as well as HDL cholesterol levels (Fig. 1 a).Table IPlasma lipids and apoB levels are increased in FXR(â/â) miceTCTGPLFCHDL cholesterolNon-HDL cholesterolApoBmg/dlWild-type106 Â± 899 Â± 18163 Â± 1425 Â± 280 Â± 625 Â± 424 Â± 1FXR(â/â)202 Â± 51-ap < 0.05.

In FXR(â/â) mice, the increase in plasma HDL cholesterol was associated with an increased HDL particle size, as indicated by the presence of large HDL1eluting before the main HDL2/3 peak (Fig. 1 a). Separation of plasma lipoproteins by two-dimensional native gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting against mouse apoA-I (Fig. 1 b), confirmed the increase of HDL size concomitant with a relative diminution of the proportion of small HDL2/3particles and an increase in the proportion of large HDL1particles in FXR(â/â) mice. Nascent pre-Î² HDL levels were also elevated in the plasma of FXR(â/â) mice (Fig. 1 b). Northern blot analysis indicated that the hepatic and intestinal mRNA expression levels of the two major protein components of HDL, apoA-I, and apoA-II, were similar inFXR(â/â) and wild-type mice (Fig. 2). The catabolism of HDL125I-apoA-I (fractional catabolic rate (FCR) = 2.3 Â± 0.2 versus 2.4 Â± 0.2 dayâ1) and that of HDL 131I-apoA-II (FCR = 2.6 Â± 0.5versus 2.7 Â± 0.2 dâ1) were also similar (n = 6; p > 0.5, all) in FXR(â/â) and wild-type animals, respectively (Fig. 3). The catabolism of HDL [3H]CEt, a non-degradable analogue of CE, was significantly delayed in FXR(â/â) compared with wild-type mice (FCR = 3.2 Â± 0.2 versus 4.1 Â± 0.3 dâ1, respectively, n = 8,p < 0.02) (Fig. 3) due to impaired hepatic uptake of HDL [3H]CEt (64 Â± 2% versus 78 Â± 1% of injected dose, respectively, n = 8,p < 0.01). The uptake of HDL [3H]CEt by other organs (i.e. adrenals, testis, heart, lungs, kidneys, and spleen) was not significantly different between both groups (data not shown). All together, these data demonstrate that the selective uptake of HDL-CE by the liver is impaired in FXR(â/â) mice.Figure 3Kinetic analysis of 125I-apoA-I,131I-apoA-II, and 3H-CEt in (â ) wild-type and (âª) FXR (â/â) mice. 125I-apoA-I- and131I-apoA-II-labeled HDL were injected into six wild-type and FXR(â/â) mice.

The expression of LCAT, HL, and of SRBI, the HDL receptor, which promotes the selective uptake (29Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T., Xu, S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar) of HDL-CE, were decreased, whereas that of ABCA1 and PLTP were not changed in the livers of FXR(â/â) mice compared with wild-type (Figs. 2and 4 a). However, the plasma LCAT activity (20 Â± 2 versus 18 Â± 1 nmol of CE/ml/h, n = 8, p > 0.5), as well as the post-heparin HL activity (67 Â± 23 versus 58 Â± 10 nmol of free fatty acid (FFA)/ml/h, respectively,n = 8, p > 0.5) was similar in both mouse models. In agreement with the mRNA data, Western blotting revealed that the hepatic expression of SRBI was significantly reduced (â63%) in FXR(â/â) (Fig. 4, b andc) versus wild-type mice, consistent with the HDL kinetic analysis data (Fig. 3). When the mice were placed on a diet containing 0.4% of the FXR agonist cholic acid, the hepatic SRBI mRNA and protein expression increased in the wild-type but not in the FXR(â/â) (Fig. 4, b and c). Taken together, these data demonstrate that FXR deletion in mice results in increased HDL cholesterol due to impaired hepatic selective removal of HDL-CE mediated by SRBI. Thus, FXR is a positive regulator of SRBI expression and thereby of HDL mediated reverse cholesterol transport in vivo. In agreement with our previous studies (17Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), plasma apoB and non-HDL cholesterol levels were increased 1.6- and 2.6-fold in FXR(â/â) compared with wild-type mice, respectively (Table I). By FPLC, both VLDL and LDL cholesterol levels were increased in FXR(â/â) mice (Fig. 1 a). FXR(â/â) mice also had 1.7-fold increased plasma phospholipids (PL) and TG levels, compared with controls. Whereas the distribution of PL among the various classes of lipoproteins was similar to that of cholesterol (not shown), more than 90% of the TG in FXR(â/â) plasma was associated with VLDL-sized particles (Fig. 1 a). To examine the mechanism underlying the increased plasma LpB levels in FXR(â/â) mice, we measured the expression of the LDL receptor (LDLr), the major receptor for LpB uptake by Northern and Western (Fig. 4, band c) blots. The expression of the LDLr was similar inFXR(â/â) and wild-type livers, ruling out delayed hepatic catabolism to significantly account for elevated LpB inFXR(â/â) mice. Particularly vexing were the parallel increases in plasma TG levels and post-heparin LPL activity (306 Â± 49 versus 179 Â± 18 nmol of FFA/ml/h,n = 8, p < 0.05) observed inFXR(â/â) compared with wild-type mice. We reasoned that if the catabolism of LpB cholesterol and TG was not significantly impaired in FXR(â/â) mice, the production of LpB would be increased in this animal model. By Northern blot analysis, the hepatic and ileal expression of apoB, apoE, apoC-II, and apoC-III, the major proteins of LpB, were similar inFXR(â/â) and wild-type mice (Fig. 2). The expression of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which plays a major role in LpB assembly (30Wetterau J.R. Gregg R.E. Harrity T.W. Arbeeny C. Cap M. Connolly F. Chu C.H.

Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4566) Google Scholar), were reduced (â67% and â42%, respectively) in the liver but not the ileum of FXR(â/â) mice (Fig. 2). However, despite reduced hepatic MTP and HMG-CoA reductase expression, the accumulation of plasma TG was dramatically increased in FXR(â/â) mice compared with wild-type (Fig. 5 a) after tyloxapol injection, which blocks the hydrolysis (26Boisfer E. Lambert G. Atger V. Tran N.Q. Pastier D. Benetollo C. Trottier J.F. Beaucamps I. Antonucci M. Laplaud M. Griglio S. Chambaz J. Kalopissis A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11564-11572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) of TG by LPL, demonstrating that the production of LpB is increased upon FXR deletion. Furthermore, the expression of apoA-IV, an important protein component of newly synthesized LpB, particularly chylomicrons (32Tso P. Liu M. Kalogeris T.J. Thomson A.B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 231-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), was increased 5.1-fold in the liver and 4.5-fold in the ileum ofFXR(â/â) compared with wild-type animals (Fig. 2). Next, we measured the absorption of dietary cholesterol inFXR(â/â) and wild-type mice by the dual isotope plasma ratio method (28Turley S.D. Herndon M.W. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 328-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control mice absorbed only 62 Â± 4% of the ingested cholesterol dose, whereas 97 Â± 2% was absorbed by the intestine of FXR(â/â) mice (n = 6,p < 0.003). Taken together, these results demonstrate that FXR deletion in mouse results in increased plasma non-HDL cholesterol and TG levels caused by an increase in LpB synthesis associated with an elevation in intestinal cholesterol absorption. Thus, FXR is a negative regulator of dietary cholesterol absorption and of chylomicrons and/or VLDL secretion. To elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for increased dietary cholesterol absorption in FXR(â/â) mice, we measured the ileal mRNA levels of ABC transporters proposed to be involved in sterol absorption. Surprisingly, the expression of ABCA1, a transporter that is thought to reduce cholesterol absorption in the enterocyte (6Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), was increased 3-fold in the ileum of FXR(â/â) compared with wild-type (Fig. 2). In contrast, the expression of one of the two ABCG transporters cooperatively involved in the efflux of sterols from the enterocyte into the intestinal lumen (16Berge K.E. Tian H. Graf G.A., Yu, L. Grishin N.V. Schultz J. Kwiterovich P. Shan B. Barnes R. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2000; 290: 1771-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar) was sharply decreased in the ileum ofFXR(â/â) mice compared with wild-types (Fig. 2). Hence, ABCG8 expression was reduced (â82%) in FXR(â/â) mice, but that of ABCG5 was not significantly altered. Because FXR plays a critical role in BA homeostasis, a function achieved through the regulation of genes involved in BA transport and biosynthesis (17Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar), we also measured the mRNA expression of a series of genes proposed to play a role in biliary cholesterol secretion inFXR(â/â) and wild-type mice. In the liver, ABCG5/8 have been proposed to play a key role in the biliary excretion of sterols (7Edwards P.A. Kast H.R. Anisfeld A.M. J.

In addition, it has antiestrogenic effects as well as non-ER-mediated effects such as inhibition of tyrosine kinase. Because of its complex biological actions, the molecular mechanisms of action of genistein are poorly understood. Here we show that genistein dose-dependently increases estrogenic transcriptional activity in mesenchymal progenitor cells, but its biological effects on osteogenesis and adipogenesis are different.

Transfection experiments show that activation of PPARÎ³ by genistein at the micromolar concentrations down-regulates its estrogenic transcriptional activity, while activation of ERÎ± or ERÎ² by genistein down-regulates PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity. Genistein concurrently activates two different transcriptional factors, ERs and PPARÎ³, which have opposite effects on osteogenesis or adipogenesis.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (PPARÎ³), one of the subtypes of PPARs, is a ligand-dependent transcription factor of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (13Willson T.M. Wahli W.

PPARÎ³ is most highly expressed in adipose tissue and is involved in critical physiological functions such as adipogenesis and glucose and cholesterol metabolism (14Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. J.

It is a target for therapeutic intervention in cardiovascular diseases, various cancers, and diabetes (15Kliewer S.A., Xu, H.E. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. Recent Prog. Horm.

Using this cell line, we recently showed that 17Î²-estradiol (E2) stimulates osteogenesis and concurrently inhibits adipogenesis in these precursor cells (23Dang Z.C. van Bezooijen R.L. Karperien M.

In the present study, we examined the effects of genistein on osteogenesis and adipogenesis and explored its molecular mechanisms of action. Our results show that genistein, in addition to its estrogenic activity, activates PPARÎ³, resulting in a down-regulation of osteogenesis and an up-regulation of adipogenesis. This action is concentration-dependent. Our data show that the balance between activated ERs and PPARÎ³ determines the biological effects of genistein.

Cells were continuously exposed to genistein 1 day after plating until the end of the experiment at day 21. Assays for ALP activity and DNA content, mRNA expression by RT-PCR, and Oil-Red-O staining for adipocytes were performed as described previously (23Dang Z.C. van Bezooijen R.L. Karperien M.

Binding buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.2, containing 50 mm KCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Membrane preparations (5 Î¼g/ml) were incubated for 180 min at 4 Â°C in the presence of [3H]rosiglitazone (BRL49653, Amersham Biosciences) (10 nm) and the tested compounds. Nonspecific binding was defined using an excess of unlabelled rosiglitazone (10 Î¼m). Incubation was terminated by the addition of ice-cold 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, followed by rapid filtration under reduced pressure through Whatman GF/C filter plates presoaked with ice-cold buffer, followed by three successive washes with the same buffer. Radioactivity was measured in a TopCount apparatus (Packard). The receptor preparation used during these experiments presented a B max of 49 pmol/mg proteins and a K d of 5.58 nm for [3H]rosiglitazone. Genistein was solubilized in Me2SO and diluted to the appropriate working concentrations (100 Î¼m-0.1 nm).

For each triplicate of sample, 100 ng of luciferase reporter and 500 ng of Î²-galactosidase expression vector were applied. The transfection medium was changed after 16 h into the different medium as indicated. After 48 h, cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and sonicated.

At concentrations from 0.1 to 10 Î¼m, genistein stimulated ALP activity, nodule formation, and calcium deposition, with a maximal effect at 1 Î¼m. In contrast, at concentrations of 25 Î¼m or higher, genistein inhibited ALP activity, nodule formation and Ca2+ deposition. These changes were paralleled by mRNA expression of the osteoblastic markers, Cbfa1, osteocalcin, and PTH/PTHrP receptor that, relative to control, were increased by 1 Î¼m genistein and decreased by 25 Î¼m (Fig. 1). Similar stimulatory and inhibitory effects of genistein on bone formation were also observed in mouse bone marrow cell cultures (Fig. 2). In those cultures, genistein stimulated ALP activity and Ca2+deposition at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 Î¼m, whereas it inhibited osteogenesis at concentrations of 25 Î¼m or higher. These data demonstrate that genistein affects osteogenesis of progenitor cells in a biphasic way; namely, it increases osteogenesis at low concentrations and inhibits osteogenesis at high concentrations.Figure 2Effects of genistein on osteogenesis in mouse bone marrow cells. Mouse bone marrow cells were cultured in 12-well plates in the medium containing charcoal-stripped serum and continuously exposed to different concentrations of genistein for 21 days. Cellular ALP activity (A) and calcium deposition (B) were quantified. Each value is the mean Â± S.E. of the results from three different wells and is representative of results from at least five different experiments. Significant differences (* < 0.05) were indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Genistein had also a biphasic effect on adipogenesis, which was, however, different to that of E2(23Dang Z.C. van Bezooijen R.L. Karperien M. Papapoulos S. LoÌwik C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). At low concentrations between 0.1 and 1 Î¼m, it decreased adipocyte numbers, while at higher concentrations (>10 Î¼m) it stimulated adipogenesis (Fig. 3 A). The effects of genistein on adipogenesis were paralleled by changes in mRNA expression of the adipocyte markers, PPARÎ³2, aP2, and lipoprotein lipase (Fig. 3 B). Adipogenic responses of mouse bone marrow cells to different doses of genistein are shown in Fig. 3 C. Mouse bone marrow cultures treated with genistein concentrations of 25 Î¼m or higher did not reach confluence, and there were no adipocytes during the cultures. However, compared with control an increase in adipocyte numbers was observed at the concentration of 10 Î¼m, whereas a decrease in adipocyte numbers was found at the concentrations of 0.1 and 1 Î¼m. These data show that genistein affects adipogenesis of progenitor cells in a biphasic way,i.e. an inhibition of adipogenesis at low concentrations and a stimulation of adipogenesis at high concentrations. Both ER-dependent and ER-independent effects were observed in KS483 cells treated with different concentrations of genistein (Fig. 4). At a concentration of 1 Î¼m, the effects were mediated by ERs because stimulation of ALP activity and inhibition of adipogenesis were both blocked by 1 Î¼m ICI 164,382, a specific antiestrogen. In contrast, at higher concentrations of genistein the effects observed were ER-independent because ICI 164.382 at concentrations from 0.01 to 100 Î¼m did not affect the action of genistein on osteogenesis or adipogenesis. In addition, E2 (10â10m to 10â5m) did not reverse the effects of genistein at 25 Î¼m on osteogenesis or adipogenesis. These data suggest that the action of genistein at low concentrations is likely ER-mediated, whereas its effects at high concentrations are not ER-mediated. We transiently transfected KS483 cells with a luciferase reporter construct containing five copies of a consensus PPRE inserted in front of a TATA box together with expression plasmids encoding human PPARÎ³2. PPRE-luc reporter activity was measured after incubation of transfected cell cultures with different doses of genistein. As shown in Fig5 A, genistein in the micromolar range increased PPRE-luc reporter activity dose-dependently. Furthermore, in the same concentration range, genistein increased PPRE-luc reporter activity in ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cell lines, T47D and MDA-MD-231, respectively (not shown). These results were confirmed with three other reporter constructs including the PPARÎ³ response element ACO-luc (25He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Thus, genistein transcriptionally activates PPRE-luc reporter activity independent of the cell lines and constructs used. To determine whether genistein activates PPARÎ³ through direct interaction with this receptor, we performed a membrane-bound PPARÎ³ binding assay. Genistein had a measurable K i of 5.7 Î¼m (Fig. 5 B), which is comparable to that of the known PPARÎ³ ligands (24Ferry G. Bruneau V. Beauverger P. Goussard M. Rodriguez M. Lamamy V. Dromaint S. Canet E. Galizzi J.P. Boutin J.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 417: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have checked whether genistein bound competitively with [3H]rosiglitazone to the same PPARÎ³ site. Indeed the dissociation constant (K d) of [3H]rosiglitazone in saturation experiments in the presence of a high dose of genistein was significantly reduced as compared with that in the absence of genistein. The maximal number of sites labeled was not altered. These data demonstrate that both genistein and [3H]rosiglitazone bind to the same PPARÎ³ site (data not shown). Therefore, genistein can interact directly with the PPARÎ³ ligand-binding domain and thus act as a PPARÎ³ ligand. As both the antiestrogenic effects and the activation of PPARÎ³ were increased by micromolar concentrations of genistein, we tested whether activation of PPARÎ³ is involved in the antiestrogenic action. When KS483 cells were treated for 18 days either with a specific PPARÎ³ agonist ciglitazone, genistein, E2, or a combination of genistein and E2, a decrease in ALP activity was observed with all treatments, except for E2 alone that increased ALP activity (Fig. 6 A). When, however, we transiently transfected KS483 cells with a luciferase reporter construct containing two copies of a consensus ERE inserted in front of a TATA box and exposed these cells to different concentrations of genistein, a dose-related increase of ERE-luc reporter activity was observed at a concentration between 0.1 and 50 Î¼m (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, the estrogenic potency of genistein at the micromolar range was greater than that of E2(10â8m), and anti-estrogenic effects of genistein were not observed (Fig. 6 C). The lack of an antiestrogenic effect in the gene reporter assays could be due to low amount of endogenous PPARÎ³2 in KS483 cells during the first 5 days (23Dang Z.C. van Bezooijen R.L. Karperien M. Papapoulos S. LoÌwik C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), the period in which the gene reporter assays were performed. To investigate this further, we transiently transfected vectors expressing human PPARÎ³2 or empty vector along with a ERE-luc construct and exposed KS483 cells to genistein. The transient co-transfection of PPARÎ³2 resulted in a decrease of ERE-luc reporter activity at high genistein concentrations. Taken together, our data show that the antiestrogenic effects of genistein are due to an activation of PPARÎ³2, leading to down-regulation of ER-mediated transcriptional activity and osteogenesis. The question that arises is whether activation of ERs by genistein can also alter the transcriptional regulation of PPARÎ³. To investigate this, we transiently transfected vectors expressing human ERÎ± or ERÎ² or empty vector along with a PPARÎ³2 construct and a PPRE-luc construct. Co-transfection of ERÎ± (Fig. 7 A) or ERÎ² (Fig. 7 B) decreased PPRE-luc reporter activity in KS483 cells treated with different concentrations of genistein. Interestingly, genistein at 1 Î¼m suppressed PPRE-luc reporter activity to a level lower than that of controls, while at 10 Î¼m it suppressed it to the control level in the presence of sufficient levels of ERs. In contrast, PPRE-luc reporter activity was higher than the control levels at 50 Î¼m genistein of and was not influenced by the levels of ERÎ± or ERÎ² (Fig. 7). We show here that PPARÎ³ is a molecular target for genistein. At the micromolar range, genistein binds to and transactivates PPARÎ³, leading to a decrease of osteogenesis and an increase in adipogenesis. In addition, genistein dose-dependently transactivates ERs, resulting in an up-regulation of osteogenesis and a down-regulation of adipogenesis. Moreover, activation of ERs by genistein could down-regulate PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity and vice versa. The balance between the activation of ERs and PPARÎ³ is concentration-related. As a result, the biological effects,i.e. osteogenesis and adipogenesis, vary according to the concentrations of genistein (Fig. 8). Our findings can explain the previously reported diverse actions of genistein in different tissues. At low concentrations (â¤1 Î¼m), genistein has ER-dependent effects on osteogenesis and adipogenesis; the effects are similar to those of E2 (23Dang Z.C. van Bezooijen R.L. Karperien M. Papapoulos S. LoÌwik C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). At high concentrations (>1 Î¼m), however, genistein has antiestrogenic actions, namely, it down-regulates osteogenesis, which is opposite to E2-induced effects. Antiestrogenic effects of genistein have been reported in many cell types and animal models, but the mechanism responsible for this is still not known (1Barnes S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Adlercreutz H. Mazur W. Ann. Med. 1997; 29: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 4Setchell K.D. Am. J. Clin.

We show here that the antiestrogenic effects are not due to a decrease of estrogenic activity of genistein. Instead, genistein at micromolar concentrations dose-dependently increased estrogenic transcriptional activity, and the levels were even higher than those induced by E2. These results are in line with reports using different cell lines or assays (6Kuiper G.G. Lemmen J.G. Carlsson B. Corton J.C. Safe S.H. van der Saag P.T. van der B.B. Gustafsson J.A.

Health Perspect. 2001; 109: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, antiestrogenic effects of genistein could not be restored or blocked by E2 or by the antiestrogen compound ICI164,382. Together, our results implicate that antiestrogenic effects of genistein are elicited via pathways other than the ER pathway. Different from E2, genistein binds to and transactivates PPARÎ³, leading to adipogenesis. Moreover, activation of PPARÎ³ may also be due to an inhibition of the MAPK pathway. It is well known that the A/B domain of PPARÎ³ contains a consensus MAPK site (29Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 30Adams M. Montague C.T. Prins J.B. Holder J.C. Smith S.A. Sanders L. Digby J.E. Sewter C.P. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K.

Inhibition of PPARÎ³ phosphorylation by the specific MAPK inhibitor PD98059 stimulates adipogenesis (32Chan G.K. Deckelbaum R.A. Bolivar I. Goltzman D. Karaplis A.C. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 4900-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Genistein inhibits p42/44 MAPKs in KS483 cells. 2Z.-C. Dang, V. Audinot, S. E. Papapoulos, J. A. Boutin, and C. W. G. M. LoÌwik, unpublished observations. It is therefore possible that an inhibition of p42/44 MAPKs contributes to an activation of PPARÎ³. By using a pure PPARÎ³ ligand, ciglitazone, we showed that activation of PPARÎ³ down-regulates osteogenesis in KS483 cells. These results are consistent with observations in MC3T3-E1 cells and in U33 cells (33Jackson S.M. Demer L.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Lecka-Czernik B. Moerman E.J. Grant D.F. Lehmann J.M. Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2376-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It has been shown that PPARÎ³2 plays a dominant role in the determination of the fate of mesenchymal progenitor cells (35Lecka-Czernik B. Gubrij I. Moerman E.J. Kajkenova O. Lipschitz D.A. Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). An increase in adipogenesis and a decrease of osteogenesis by genistein at concentrations of 25 Î¼m or higher indicate that PPARÎ³ actions dominate at higher genistein concentrations. Genistein concurrently activates two different transcriptional factors, ERs and PPARÎ³. These two transcriptional factors have opposite effects on osteogenesis or adipogenesis. We showed that activation of PPARÎ³ by genistein at the micromolar concentrations down-regulates its estrogenic transcriptional activity, while activation of ERÎ± or ERÎ² down-regulates PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity. It is plausible that genistein at certain concentrations activates ERs and PPARÎ³ to a different extent. The balance between activated ERs and PPARÎ³ determines the biological effects of genistein, i.e.osteogenesis and adipogenesis, which are fully concentration-dependent. Our findings provide the molecular basis of the mechanism of action of genistein and may have wide implications. Diverse effects of genistein in different tissues have been explained by the high binding affinity for ERÎ² because ERÎ² can act as a dominant negative regulator of estrogenic activity. These dominant negative effects were only observed below the micromolar concentrations of genistein (36Pettersson K. Delaunay F. Gustafsson J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4970-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, the distinct genistein effects in different tissues are often observed at the micromolar concentrations (1Barnes S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Adlercreutz H. Mazur W. Ann.

Kirk M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Kim H. Xu J. Biofactors. 2000; 12: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We show that the balance between activated ERs and PPARÎ³ determines the biological effects of genistein, which might explain its diverse biological effects in different organs. Therefore, the biological effects of genistein in certain tissues strongly depend on the concentration of genistein present and the levels of ERs and PPARÎ³ within that particular tissue. There is accumulating evidence that health benefits occur only when phytoestrogens are consumed in sufficient quantities (1Barnes S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Adlercreutz H. Mazur W. Ann. Med. 1997; 29: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 4Setchell K.D. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1998; 68: 1333S-1346SCrossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). It has been reported that plasma concentration of genistein is relatively low and generally less than 40 nm in humans consuming diets without soy, whereas it can reach 4 Î¼m in the plasma of Japanese who consume high amount of soy products (1Barnes S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 2Adlercreutz H. Mazur W. Ann.

Our findings might explain why genistein functions only at a certain level. For example, genistein at the micromolar concentration range inhibits growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells like MCF7 and T47 D as well as ER-negative breast cancer cells like MDA-MD-231 cells (38Shao Z.M. Shen Z.Z. Fontana J.A. Barsky S.H. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 2409-2416PubMed Google Scholar). Since it is now well established that ligand activation of PPARÎ³ inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in these cancer cells (39Sasaki T. Fujimoto Y. Tsuchida A. Kawasaki Y. Kuwada Y. Chayama K. Pathobiology. 2001; 69: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 40Rumi M.A. Sato H. Ishihara S. Ortega C. Kadowaki Y. Kinoshita Y. J. Lab. Clin.

In this report, we have cloned and characterized the mouse OF45 cDNA and genomic region. Mouse OF45 (also called MEPE) was similar to its rat orthologue in that its expression was increased during mineralization in osteoblast cultures and the protein was highly expressed within the osteocytes that are imbedded within bone. To further determine the role of OF45 in bone metabolism, we generated a targeted mouse line deficient in this protein. Ablation ofOF45 resulted in increased bone mass. In fact, disruption of only a single allele of OF45 caused significantly increased bone mass. In addition, knockout mice were resistant to aging-associated trabecular bone loss. Cancellous bone histomorphometry revealed that the increased bone mass was the result of increased osteoblast number and osteoblast activity with unaltered osteoclast number and osteoclast surface in knockout animals. Consistent with the bone histomorphometric results, we also determined thatOF45 knockout osteoblasts produced significantly more mineralized nodules in ex vivo cell cultures than did wild type osteoblasts. Osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in ex vivo cultures was unaffected by OF45 mutation. We conclude that OF45 plays an inhibitory role in bone formation in mouse.

Osteoblasts produce, organize, and mineralize bone matrix in forming bone. Osteoclasts break down matrix by forming a lytic pocket in which bone is degraded and calcium is released. The generation and activity of these cell types is tightly regulated to provide equilibrium between formation and resorption and, thereby, an appropriate balance of strength and mineral release. Under certain conditions, such as aging, postmenopausal estrogen deficiency, or some pathophysiological states, there can exist an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. As a result, skeletal mass and strength are compromised and osteoporotic fractures can occur in the afflicted individuals. Bone is produced by the organization and mineralization of the extracellular matrix produced by osteoblasts. The major component of the extracellular matrix of these cells is Type I collagen, which functions as a scaffold for new bone. In addition, non-collagenous matrix proteins have been identified that influence the operations of bone turnover, formation, and repair. These proteins are generally acidic and highly post-translationally modified by phosphorylation, glycosylation, or sulfation (1McKee M.D. Zalzal S. Nanci A. Anat. Rec. 1996; 245: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of extracellular matrix genes in mice has been a useful method to determine the in vivo functions of several matrix proteins. For example, osteocalcin is an abundant gamma carboxyl glutamic acid-containing bone matrix protein shown to be highly expressed in osteoblasts and is a biochemical marker of the bone remodeling process. Osteocalcin deletion in mice results in increased cortical bone thickness due to increased osteoblast activity, indicating that osteocalcin has negative effects in vivo on osteoblasts and bone formation (2Ducy P. Desbois C. Boyce B. Pinero G. Story B. Dunstan C. Smith E. Bonadio J. Goldstein S. Gundberg C. Bradley A. Karsenty G. Nature. 1996; 382: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Another gene of this category, matrix glutamic acid protein (known as âMGPâ),1 was deleted in mice, resulting in extensive cartilage calcification and in the inappropriate calcification of arteries, leading to blood vessel rupture, and lethality in homozygotes (3Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Ablation of the extracellular matrix protein osteonectin causes reduced bone formation with a decrease in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts resulting in a net loss of trabecular bone compared with wild type controls (4Delaney A.M. Amling M. Priemel M. Howe C. Baron R. Canalis E. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 915-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of osteopontin, an RGD-containing protein, results in a defect in the in vitro differentiation of osteoclasts; increased mineral content and maturity in long bones; and resistance to ovariectomy-induced, parathyroid hormone-induced, and mechanical unloading-induced bone resorption in mice (5Rittling S.R.

The functions of matrix proteins can be further elucidated through the characterization of mice deficient in combinations of genes. For example, mice deficient in both osteopontin and MGP exhibit more vascular calcification than the MGP knockout mice, demonstrating that osteopontin can be an inhibitor of ectopic calcification in vivo (9Speer M.Y. McKee M.D. Guildberg R.E. Liaw L. Yang H.-Y. Tung E. Karsenty G. Giachelli C.M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1047-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In an effort to further characterize the process of bone metabolism and identify the proteins involved, we screened RNA of rat bone marrow cell cultures for novel transcripts specific to bone mineralization (10Petersen D.N.

This screen produced a novel clone that we designated osteoblast/osteocyte factor 45 (OF45). Rat OF45encodes an RGD protein having 45% homology to the recently cloned human MEPE as well as loose homology toAG-1/DMP1. In rat, OF45 is highly expressed in the tibial shaft and metaphysis as well as in osteoblasts of induced bone marrow cultures, calvaria, and the UMR106 osteoblastic cell line. Immunohistochemistry in rat tibia revealed abundant OF45 protein in the osteocytes. Newly embedded rat osteocytes were also positive for OF45 in a marrow ablation model. Interestingly, the temporal expression pattern of OF45 differs from other well-characterized bone markers such as osteocalcin, osteonectin, and osteopontin in both in vitro and in vivo bone growth models (10Petersen D.N.

In this report we have cloned and characterized the mouse OF45 cDNA. With the exception of some additional sequence we report at the 5-prime end, the sequence reported here was identical to that recently published as MEPE (11Argiro L. Desbarats M. Glorieux F.H. Ecarot B. Genomics. 2001; 74: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the functional significance of an elimination or reduction of OF45 expression, we have cloned the mouse OF45genomic DNA, generated a mouse line with a targeted disruption of theOF45 gene, and subjected these mice to phenotypic analysis. A 1255-bp probe encoding most of the rat OF45 cDNA sequence, excluding the 3â²-untranslated repeat, was used to screen a mouse 129 genomic lambda phage library (12Sambrook J.F. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 15-kb clone found to include exon 3 was used to generate PCR primers to clone the complete cDNA, the BAC clone, as well as the targeting construct. The 5â²-end of the mRNA was determined by RNA ligase-mediated RACE as described (13Frohman M.A. PCR Methods and Applications.

Briefly, 50 Î¼g of total RNA from mouse tibia was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) and the 5â²-cap was removed using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). The RNA linker generated from the plasmid pGbx-1 (Gift from Dr. M. A. Frohman) was ligated to the decapped RNA using T4 RNA ligase (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). The RNA was converted to cDNA by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and p(dT)12â18 primer (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD). PCR was used to amplify the 5-end of the cDNA using primer pair NRC-1â288A and 36387.233B and primer pair NRC-1â288B and 36387.233A in the first and second round, respectively. A single PCR product of â¼550 bp was obtained in the second round PCR. A control sample in which the pyrophosphatase step was omitted did not yield a PCR product, indicating that the â¼550-bp product likely resulted from full-length mRNA that had been 5â²-capped. The second round PCR fragment was isolated and ligated using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Insert-containing plasmids were sequenced. The 3â²-end of the mRNA was determined using a 3â² RACE kit (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) as suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, 5 Î¼g of mouse tibia total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the AP primer provided. The PCR reaction amplified the sequence between OF45 nucleotide 527 (primer 36387.233E) and the AUAP primer provided. Two fragments close in size were cloned with the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The sequences of the two fragments were identical except for a short stretch of additional sequence at the 3â²-end. The gene-specific primers were as follows: 36387.233A, 5â²-TGTGTCAGGTAGTGAGTGCTCC-3â²; 36387.233B, 5â²-ACTGCCACCATGTCCTTCTC-3â²; 36387.233C, 5â²-CCAGCAGATGTCAATGATGC-3â²; 36387.233D, 5â²-TTGGCAGCATCTGTGTATCC-3â²; 36387.233E, 5â²-CCCAAGAGCAGCAAAGGTAG-3â²; and 36387.233F, 5â²-TGCGTGATATTTCTGAGGAGG-3â². The pGbx-1 RNA linker primers were, NRC-1â288A, 5â²-CCAAGACTCACTGGGTACTGC-3â²; NRC-2â288B, 5â²-CTAGAGGGGCCTGTTGAACC-3â²; NRC-3â288C, 5â²-GGGAGAGGCCAGCGTATTCC-3â²; RC NRC-1â30A, 5â²-GCAGTACCCAGTGAGTCTTGG-3â²; RC NRC-2â30B, 5â²-GGTTCAACAGGCCCCTCTA-3â²; and RC NRC-3â30C, 5â²-GGAATACGCTGGCCTCTCCC-3â². A 124-bp probe for the 5â²-end of the cDNA was generated by PCR with primers to amplify bases 12â135 of the cDNA sequence using primers 36393.80A (5â²-TTTCAGCAAATGCCCAGAG-3â²) and 36393.80B (5â²-CCAGGTCATACTGAAGAGGAGC-3â²). This probe was sent to Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO) for screening of a mouse ES-129/SVIII BAC library. A single clone was identified and characterized. Chromosomal localization was determined by fluorescence in situhybridization using the BAC clone by Genome Systems, Inc. according to their protocols. Intron/exon boundaries were determined by alignment of BAC clone sequence with the OF45 cDNA sequence. The 1340 bp containing the coding region of the mouse OF45 cDNA (bases 53â1392) was amplified using primers 36393.44C (5â²-TTTCCTGAAGGTGAATGACG-3â²) and 36393.44H (5â²-CTAGTCACCATGACTCTCACTAG-3â²) and subcloned in the cytomegalovirus mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for transfection into CHO cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). High titer polyclonal antiserum was generated by immunization of rabbits with bacterial expressed full-length OF45 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). OF45 antibody was affinity-purified by chromatography on OF45-coupled agarose beads by standard methods (14Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated by electrophoresis on Novex (San Diego, CA) 10% NuPAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose using a semi-dry transfer. Blots were blocked using 1% Western Blocking Reagent from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany) for 1 h and 1oantibody diluted in 0.5% block for 1 h. After washing, goat anti-rabbit peroxidase 2o antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted into 0.5% block was applied to the blot for 1 h. Signal was detected using an ECL detection kit (AmershamBiosciences, Buckinghamshire, England). Multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were hybridized with the full-length OF45 cDNA. RNA isolated from mouse tissues was converted to cDNA by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and poly(dT)12â18 primer (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD). PCR was used to amplify an internal 483 bp from OF45mRNA bases 986â1468 using primers 36499â143A (5â²-ACTATCCACAAGTGGCCTCG-3â²) and 36499â143B (5â²-CTGTTGGCTTGCTCAGTTCC-3â²). The cDNA was then hybridized with a radiolabeled cDNA probe specific to bases 160â1020. Genomic DNA fragments from the 15-kb genomic clone were subcloned into the JNS2 targeting plasmid (15Dombrowicz D. Flamand V. Brigman K.K. Koller B.H. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1993; 75: 969-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) E14Tg2a embryonic stem (ES) cell line derived from the 129sj mouse strain was used for gene targeting of theOF45 locus (16Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Electroporation, selection, expansion, and microinjection of ES cells into C57BL/6 embryos were as described previously (17Roach M.L. Stock J.L. Byrum R. Koller B.H. McNeish J.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Out of 70 neomycin and gancyclovir-resistant clones, four were positive for the desired recombination event, resulting in a targeting frequency of 1 in 17. Chimeric animals were mated with C57BL/6 males and females. An 850-bp SpeI/MscI probe, homologous to a region directly 3â² of the targeted mutation, was used to genotype agouti offspring by Southern blot analysis. Digestion of tail DNA with BamHI/BglII double digest resulted in a 10-kb hybridizing band in the wild type allele and a 9-kb hybridizing band in the targeted allele. F2 or F3 129/Bl6 mix heterozygote mice were bred to generate successive populations of littermates used for in vivo experimentation at either 4 months or 1 year of age. The same parent animals were used to generate both 4-month and 1-year age groups. 10-month-old males backcrossed onto a C57/Bl6 background for nine generations were used for dynamic histomorphometry studies. Animals were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were provided food and water ad libitum. 12 and 2 days prior to sacrifice, mice were given subcutaneous injection of the fluorochrome calcein at 10 mg/kg (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and the femurs were placed in 70% ethanol for later pQCT and histomorphometric analysis. The experiment was conducted according to Pfizer Animal Care and Use-approved protocols, and the animals were maintained in accordance with the ILAR (Institute of Laboratory Animal Research) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Calcium and inorganic phosphate levels were measured from blood serum at DNX Transgenic Sciences (Cranbury, NJ) using the ACE Clinical Chemistry System (Alfa Wassermann Inc., West Caldwell, NJ) by the manufacturer's protocols. One-year-old animals were used for this study. Sera from 12 male animals of each genotype were used. Seven wild type and seven knockout females were also studied. Femurs were examined at 2Ã and 3Ã magnification on a Faxitron model MX-20 Specimen Radiography System (Buffalo Grove, IL) with Kodak Min-R 2000 Mammography film in Min-R 2000 cassettes with an intensifying screen. Magnification was calculated by SID/SOD = IS/OS where SID is source to image distance, SOD is source to object distance, IS is image size, and OS is object size. The femurs of 12 to 27 animals of each sex, age, and genotype were examined. Excised femurs were scanned by a pQCT x-ray machine (Stratec XCT Research M, Norland Medical Systems, Fort Atkinson, WI) with software version 5.40. A 1-mm-thick cross-section of the femur metaphysis was taken at 2.5 mm proximal from the distal end with a voxel size of 0.07 mm. Cortical bone was defined and analyzed using contour mode 2 and cortical mode 4. An outer threshold setting of 340 mg/cm3 was used to distinguish the cortical shell from soft tissue and an inner threshold of 529 mg/cm3 to distinguish cortical bone along the endocortical surface. Trabecular bone was determined using peel mode 4 with a threshold setting of 655 mg/cm3 to distinguish (sub)cortical from cancellous bone. An additional concentric peel of 1% of the defined cancellous bone was used to ensure (sub)cortical bone was eliminated from the analysis. Volumetric content, density, and area were determined for both trabecular and cortical bone. Using the above setting, we have determined that the ex vivo precision of volumetric content, density, and area of total bone, trabecular, and cortical regions ranged from 0.99% to 3.49% with repositioning (18Ke H.Z., Qi, H. Chidsey-Frink K.L. Crawford D.T. Thompson D.D. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Number of animals examined: females, 4 months, 12 WT, 20 Het, 18 KO; females, 1 year, 12 WT, 17 Het, 27 KO; males, 4 months, 18 WT, 21 Het, 18 KO; and males, 1 year, 21 WT, 19 Het, 21 KO. Following pQCT analysis, the distal half of the femur from each animal of 4-month-old and 1-year-old animals was dehydrated and embedded in methyl methacrylate. 4-Î¼m longitudinal sections were prepared with a Reichert-Jung Polycut S microtome (Leica, Deerfield, IL) and stained with modified Masson's Trichrome stain. Trabecular bone volume, trabecular number, and trabecular thickness were determined on the distal femoral metaphysis for these 4-month-old and 1-year-old animals (19Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar, 20Jee W.S.S. Li X.J. Inoue J. Jee K.W. Haba T.

To understand the changes in osteoblasts and osteoclasts on the cancellous bone, a group of wild type (n = 8) and knockout (n = 10) male mice were necropsied at 10 months of age. The left distal half of the femur from these 10-month-old animals was decalcified, and 4-Î¼m longitudinal sections were prepared and stained with Toluidine Blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). These decalcified sections were used to determine the trabecular bone volume (BV/TV), percent osteoblast surface (Ob.S/BS), number of osteoblast per millimeter of bone surface (N.Ob/BS), percent osteoclast surface (Oc.S/BS), and number of osteoclast per millimeter of bone surface (N.Oc/BS) on the same area of the distal femoral metaphysis as described above (19Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar, 20Jee W.S.S. Li X.J. Inoue J.

The right distal half of the femur from 10-month-old animals was dehydrated and embedded in methyl methacrylate. 10-Î¼m longitudinal sections were prepared and left unstained for the determination of mineral apposition rate, bone formation rate/bone surface referent (BFR/BS), and bone formation rate/tissue volume referent (BFR/TV) on the distal femoral metaphysis (19Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar, 20Jee W.S.S. Li X.J. Inoue J.

An Image Analysis System (Osteomeasure, Inc., Atlanta, GA) was used for all histomorphometric analysis. Histomorphometric measurements were performed on cancellous bone tissue of the distal femoral metaphyses between 0.5 and 2 mm proximal to the growth plate-epiphyseal junction and extended to the endocortical surface in the lateral dimension (21Ke H.Z. Brown T.A. Chidsey-Frink K.L. Qi H. Crawford D.T. Simmons H.A. Petersen D.N. Allen M.R. McNeish J.D. Thompson D.D. J. Musculoskel. Neuron. Interact. 2002; 2: 479-488PubMed Google Scholar). Long bones were isolated from 3- to 6-month-old animals. Femur and tibia bone marrow cells harvested by centrifugation were plated at a density of 15 Ã 106 cells per 100-mm plate in Î±-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 Î¼g/ml Gentamicin (Invitrogen). 50 Î¼g/ml l-ascorbic acid, and 10 mm Î²-glycerophosphate were added at day 10 of culture. Cultures were fed three times per week, maintained for 4 weeks, and then stained by the Von Kossa method (22Kossa J.von Beitr. Pathol. Anat. Allg. Pathol. 1901; 29: 163-202Google Scholar). Calvaria were dissected from postnatal day 3 mice. 0.2 mg/ml collagenase P/0.25% Trypsin digestions were performed as described previously (23Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L.

The cells liberated in the second digest were plated at 2 Ã 104cells/cm2. At confluence, cultures were supplemented with 50 Î¼g/ml l-ascorbic acid and 10 mmÎ²-glycerophosphate. Cells were later harvested for RNA or Alizarin Red staining (24Stanford C.M. Jacobson P.A. Eanes E.D. Lembke L.A. Midura R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9420-9428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Stain solubilization and quantitation were as described (25Schiller P.C. D'Ippolito G. Roos B.A. Howard G.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Bone marrow cultures were established as described above, plated at 1 Ã 106 cells per well in a 24-well plate. Cells were stimulated with 10 nm1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and TRAP stained as described (26Takahashi N. Yamana H. Yoshiki S. Roodman G.D. Mundy G.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Suda T. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Bone resorption was assessed by culturing bone marrow cells on bone slices for 21 days and counting the resorption pits as has been described by Grasser et al. (27Grasser W.A. Pan L.C. Thompson D.D. Paralkar V.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Statistical significance of in vivo and in vitro parameters was determined by two-tailed Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. MouseOF45 was cloned using low stringency hybridization of a ratOF45 sequence to a murine 129 strain lambda phage genomic library. The full-length cDNA was then cloned by RT-PCR and 5â²- and 3â²-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) from mouse tibia RNA. The complete cDNA was 1741 bp in length. An additional 1679-bp cDNA was cloned, which was identical to the longer, more abundant message with the exception of a shorter 3â²-extension. Three early methionine codons allow alternative start sites for the OF45 protein, the first of which would result in a 441-amino acid protein. A Kyte-Doolittle hydrophilicity plot revealed that the peptide sequence contained a hydrophobic leader sequence followed by a hydrophilic protein (Fig. 1 A). Analysis of the amino acid sequence with PSORTII software, which predicts the subcellular localization sites of proteins from their amino acid sequences, indicated that this cDNA likely encodes an extracellular protein (28Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 29McGeoch D.J. Virus Res. 1985; 3: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). The predicted site of cleavage would be between Ala-24 and Ala-25, yielding a 417-amino acid secreted peptide with a calculated molecular mass of 44247 Da. Experimental confirmation of this analysis was obtained by Western blot analysis of media from transiently transfected CHO cells. An OF45-specific antibody detected a secreted protein of â¼44 kDa (Fig. 1 B). An OF45 peptide product of lower molecular weight was also detected in variable amounts, suggesting that proteolytic processing or degradation occurred in the media. The predicted amino acid composition of the basic OF45 peptide (predicted pI 9.17) was rich in serine, glycine, and charged residues. Several consensus protein kinase C, casein kinase II, tyrosine kinase, and cAMP-dependant kinase phosphorylation sites, oneN-glycosylation site, and a SDGD glycosaminoglycan binding site offer the potential for post-translational modifications to increase the acidic character of the protein. Based on sequence and expression analysis, we believe that the mouse OF45cDNA reported here represents the mouse orthologue of the ratOF45 gene (10Petersen D.N. Tkalcevic G.T. Mansolf A.L. Rivera-Gonzalez R. Brown T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36172-36180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number 260922). Alignment with the rat OF45 amino acid sequence demonstrated 67% identity. Importantly, key structural features were conserved. Both proteins were rich in serine, glycine, and charged amino acids and included an amino-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that targeted the peptides for secretion. The RGD sequence at amino acids 183â185 is an element traditionally involved in cell-matrix interactions through integrin binding and signaling and was also conserved between species. Comparison of the OF45 cDNA sequence to GenBankTM using the BLAST 1.4 algorithm (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70353) Google Scholar) showed 45% amino acid identity to the recently identified human matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) gene (32Rowe P.S. de Zoysa P.A. Dong R. Wang H.R. White K.E. Econs M.J. Oudet C.L. Genomics. 2000; 67: 54-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The macaque MEPE gene showed similar identity to OF45(GenBankTM accession number AB05025). The homology between mouse OF45 and human MEPE was distributed throughout the sequences and the RGD motif was conserved. MEPE was cloned as a candidate gene for a tumor-secreted phosphaturic factor responsible for tumor-induced osteomalacia. Like MEPE, OF45 shares structural features common to a class of extracellular matrix phosphoglycoproteins that includes osteopontin, dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein 1, and bone sialoprotein II. These genes are highly expressed in bone or dentin and play significant roles in mineralization (33Robey P.G. Connect.

https://openalex.org/W2068671939,"We have investigated mechanisms of mitochondrial stress-induced phenotypic changes and cell invasion in tumorigenic but poorly invasive human pulmonary carcinoma A549 cells that were partly depleted of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Depletion of mtDNA (genetic stress) caused a markedly lower electron transport-coupled ATP synthesis, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, elevation of steady state [Ca2+]c, and notably induction of both glycolysis and gluconeogenic pathway enzymes. Markers of tumor invasion, cathepsin L and TGFÎ²1, were overexpressed; calcium-dependent MAP kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) and calcineurin were activated. The levels of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Bcl-XL were increased, and the cellular levels of pro-apoptotic proteins Bid and Bax were reduced. Both mtDNA-depleted cells (genetic stress) and control cells treated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (metabolic stress) exhibited higher invasive behavior than control cells in a Matrigel basement membrane matrix assay system. MtDNA-depleted cells stably expressing anti-sense cathepsin L RNA, TGFÎ²1 RNA, or treated with specific inhibitors showed reduced invasion. Reverted cells with 80% of control cell mtDNA exhibited marker protein levels, cell morphology and invasive property closer to control cells. Our results suggest that the mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling pathway operating through increased [Ca2+]c plays an important role in cancer progression and metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2330746655,"Src is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, the expression and activity of which is increased in >80% of human colon cancers with respect to normal colonic epithelium. Previous studies from this and other laboratories have demonstrated that Src activity contributes to tumorigenicity of established colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. Src participates in the regulation of many signal transduction pathways, among which are those leading to cellular survival. In this study, we addressed the potential role of Src activation to a specific aspect of tumor cell survival, resistance to detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis). Using five colon tumor cell lines with different biologic properties and genetic alterations, we demonstrate that expression and activity of Src corresponds with resistance to anoikis. Enforced expression of activated Src in subclones of SW480 cells (of low intrinsic Src expression and activity) increases resistance to anoikis; whereas decreased Src expression in HT29 cells (of high Src expression and activity) by transfection with anti-sense Src expression vectors increases susceptibility to anoikis. In contrast, increasing or decreasing Src expression had no effect on susceptibility to staurosporine-induced apoptosis in attached cells. PD173955, a Src family-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, increases the susceptibility of HT29 cells to anoikis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Increasing Src expression and activity led to increased phosphorylation of Akt, a mediator of cellular survival pathways, whereas decreasing Src activity led to decreased Akt phosphorylation. In colon tumor cells with high Src activity, the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY 294002 sensitized cells to anoikis. These results suggest that Src activation may contribute to colon tumor progression and metastasis in part by activating Akt-mediated survival pathways that decrease sensitivity of detached cells to anoikis."
https://openalex.org/W2027458529,"Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factors are cytoplasmic proteins that can be activated by Janus kinases (JAK) and that modulate gene expression in response to cytokine receptor stimulation. STAT proteins dimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and activate specific target genes. In the present study, we show for the first time that interleukin-6 (IL), in the presence of its soluble receptor (sIL-6R), induces activation of JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1/STAT3 proteins in bovine articular chondrocytes. Western blotting and mobility shift assays demonstrated that this effect is accompanied by the DNA binding of the STAT proteins. The mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was also activated in response to IL-6/sIL-6R association, as reflected by phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 proteins. In these conditions, the expression of cartilage-specific matrix genes, type II collagen, aggrecan core, and link proteins was found to be markedly down-regulated. This negative effect was abolished by addition of parthenolide, an inhibitor of the STAT activation, whereas blockade of the MAP kinases with PD098059 was without significant effect. Thus, activation of the STAT signaling pathways, but not ERK-dependent pathways, is essential for down-regulation of the major cartilage-specific matrix genes by IL-6. In addition, a parallel reduction of Sox9 expression, a key factor of chondrocyte phenotype, was found in these experimental conditions.

JAKs are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase effectors that are activated by ligand-receptor interactions, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, which then translocate to the nucleus and act on target gene transcription. Four kinases of the JAK family and seven mammalian STATs have been identified, which may be activated individually or in combination (3Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Google Scholar).IL-6 initiates its action by binding to its receptor, which is composed of the 80-kDa ligand-binding subunit (IL-6R) and the signal-transducing subunit, gp130 (4Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakagawa T. Yasukawa K. Yamanishi K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1993; 260: 1808-1810Google Scholar). After ligand binding, the gp130 subunits aggregate into a complex consisting of the IL-6R, two gp130 molecules, and one IL-6 molecule (5Schindler C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 64: 621-651Google Scholar). This aggregation activates the gp130-associated protein-tyrosine kinases JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, which tyrosine phosphorylate gp130, themselves, and STAT3 and -1. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3/1 occurs at a single residue (STAT3-Tyr705; STAT1-Tyr701) which is located in the conserved SH2 allowing homo- as well as heterodimerization (6Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Google Scholar). During translocation to the nucleus, STAT3 and STAT1 are specifically phosphorylated on a serine residue, a prerequisite for being fully active on gene transcription (7Zhang X. Blenis J., Li, H-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Google Scholar). However, cellular responses to IL-6 can also be implemented via gp130-mediated signaling through interaction of IL-6 with a soluble form of the IL-6R (sIL-6R), which is released by either differential IL-6R mRNA splicing or proteolytic shedding from the cell membrane (review in Ref.8Jones S.A. Horiuchi S. Topley N. Yamamoto N. Fuller G.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 43-58Google Scholar). This naturally occurring sIL-6R is present in several body fluids of patients with various diseases as well as in healthy subjects (9Frieling J.T.M. Van Deuren M. Wijdenes J. Van der Meer J.W.M. Clement C. Van der Linden C.J. Sauerwein R.W. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 171: 469-472Google Scholar, 10Novick D. Engelmann H. Wallach D. Rubistein M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1409-1414Google Scholar, 11Desgeorges A. Gabay C. Silacci P. Novick D. Roux-Lombard P. Gruau G. Dayer J.M. Vischer T.L. Guerne P-A. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 1510-1516Google Scholar). IL-6 regulates several functions, including immunological reactions in host defense, inflammation, hematopoiesis, and oncogenesis (12Kishimoto T. Blood. 1989; 74: 1-10Google Scholar, 13Akira S. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 1-78Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggest that IL-6, as well as the other IL-6 family member oncostatin, is implicated in both inflammatory and degenerative joint diseases (rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis). IL-6 has been shown to increase the amount of inflammatory cells in synovial tissue (14Guerne P.A. Zuraw B.L. Vaughan J.H. Carson D.A. Lotz M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 585-592Google Scholar) and to amplify the IL-1 effects on the increased metalloprotease synthesis and inhibition of proteoglycan production (15Nietfeld J.J. Wilbrink B. Helle M. van Roy J.L. Den Otter W. Swaak A.J. Huber-Bruning O. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 33: 1695-1701Google Scholar). The levels of IL-6 in synovial fluid and serum are significantly higher in RA and osteoarthritis patients relative to controls (16Hirano T. Matsuda T. Turner M. Miyasaka N. Buchan G. Tang B. Sato K. Shimizu M. Maini R. Feldmann M. Kishimoto T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 1797-1801Google Scholar, 17Houssiau F.A. Devogelaer J.P. Van Damme J., De Deuchaisies C.N. van Snick J. Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 784-788Google Scholar, 18Sack V. Kinne R. Marx T. Heppt P. Bender S. Emmrich F. Rheumatol. Int. 1993; 13: 45-51Google Scholar, 19Madhok R. Crilly A. Watson J. Capell H.A. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1993; 52: 232-234Google Scholar, 20Kaneko S. Satoh T. Chiba J., Ju, C. Inoue K. Cytokines Cell. Mol. Therapy. 2000; 6: 71-79Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice overexpressing IL-6 display abnormal features, including symptoms observed in human RA (21Suematsu S. Matsuda T. Aozasa K. Akira S. Nakano N. Ohno S. Miyazaki J. Yamamura K. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7547-7551Google Scholar, 22Nishimoto N. Kishimoto T. Yoshizaki K. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2000; 59, Suppl. I: i21-i27Google Scholar). Today, IL-6 blocking strategy has become a potential approach to treat the IL-6-related immune inflammatory diseases of humans such as Castleman's disease and RA (22Nishimoto N. Kishimoto T. Yoshizaki K. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2000; 59, Suppl. I: i21-i27Google Scholar). Indeed, inactivation of the IL-6 gene completely protected DBA/1J mice from collagen-induced arthritis (23Alonzi T. Fattori E. Lazzaro D. Costa P. Probert L. Kollias G., De Benedetti F. Poli V. Gilberto G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 461-468Google Scholar) or it delayed the onset of the pathological process and also reduced its severity (24Sasai M. Saeki Y. Ohshima S. Nishioka K. Mima T. Tanaka T. Katada Y. Yoshizaki K. Suemura M. Kishimoto T. Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1635-1643Google Scholar), indicating that IL-6 seems to be required for the development of arthritis. Anti-mouse IL-6R antibody treatment also suppressed the development of arthritis and protected knee joints from destructive change in DBA/1J mice immunized with bovine type II collagen (25Takagi N. Mihara M. Moriya Y. Nishimoto N. Yoshizaka K. Kishimoto T. Takeda Y. Ohsugi T. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 2117-2121Google Scholar). Taken together with the findings that treatment of the collagen-induced arthritis with anti-tumor necrosis factor-Î± and anti-IL-1 antibodies has been shown to be effective on this established murine model (26van den Berg W.B. Joosten L.A.B. Helsen M. van de Loo F.A.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 95: 237-243Google Scholar, 27Williams R.O. Feldman M. Maini R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9784-9788Google Scholar), IL-6 may even act earlier in the course of the disease than those of tumor necrosis factor-Î± and IL-1 (22Nishimoto N. Kishimoto T. Yoshizaki K. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2000; 59, Suppl. I: i21-i27Google Scholar). First treatment of human RA patients with mouse monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibody or with humanized anti-IL-6R antibody have resulted in improvement of symptoms and laboratory findings (28Wendling D. Racadot E. Wijdenes J. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 20: 259-262Google Scholar, 29Yoshizaki K. Nishimoto N. Mihara M. Kishimoto T. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1998; 20: 247-259Google Scholar).Although IL-6 may contribute to the destructive changes of bone and cartilage accompanying joint diseases, its mechanism of action on the cartilage and bone cells and the pathways whereby it controls their gene expression are unknown. Only a limited number of in vitro findings have been reported. IL-6 in the presence of soluble IL-6R has been shown to activate osteoclasts to induce bone resorptionin vitro, suggesting that IL-6 may be involved in osteoporosis (30Ishimi Y. Miyaura C. Jin C.H. Akatsu T. Abe E. Nakamura Y. Yamaguchi A. Yoshiki S. Matsuda T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3297-3303Google Scholar). A combination of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R was found to activate the JAK/STAT and MAP kinase pathways in MG-63 human osteoblastic cells (31Nishimura R. Moriyama K. Yasukawa K. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 777-785Google Scholar). In articular chondrocytes, contradictory results have been reported on the effects of IL-6 on proteoglycan synthesis. It must be noted that in most of the related studies, the IL-6 effect was investigated in connection with that of other cytokines, such as IGF-1 and IL-1. For example, very high doses of IL-6 were found to decrease the enhancing effect of IGF-1 on proteoglycan synthesis (32Lazarus D.D. Moldawer L.L. Lowry S.F. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 219-223Google Scholar). It was also shown that IL-6 was required for the inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis by IL-1 in human articular chondrocytes (15Nietfeld J.J. Wilbrink B. Helle M. van Roy J.L. Den Otter W. Swaak A.J. Huber-Bruning O. Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 33: 1695-1701Google Scholar) but the latter results were not reproduced by others (33Malfait A-M. Verbruggen G. Veys E.M. Lambert J., De Ridder L. Cornelissen M. J. Rheumatol. 1994; 21: 314-320Google Scholar). The contradictory results may be because of the fact that IL-6 effects were investigated in the absence of soluble IL-6 receptor. Indeed, more recent work from Guerne et al. (34Guerne P.A. Desgeorges A. Jaspar J.M. Relic B. Peter R. Hoffmeyer P. Dayer J.M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 253-260Google Scholar) indicates that levels of membrane-anchored IL-6 receptor on chondrocytes are lower compared with those on other cell types, such as hepatocytes, and that in vitro addition of sIL-6R to IL-6 is required to observe the full effect of the cytokine. However, until recently, the IL-6 signaling pathway for these cells has not been identified nor has the functional significance been investigated on their effects on the major extracellular matrix components.The aim of the present study was therefore to analyze the cytoplasmic signaling pathways that were activated in IL-6/sIL-6R-treated bovine articular chondrocytes, focusing on the Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), which are known to be involved in IL-6 signaling, and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, which may play a role in IL-6 signaling (35Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Google Scholar, 36Thomas S.M., De Marco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegona S. Brugge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Google Scholar, 37Dacipour M. Kumar G. Amaral M.C. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4743-4753Google Scholar). In addition, we determined the relationship between the activation of these IL-6 signaling pathways and the control of type II collagen, aggrecan core and link protein gene expression.The high mobility group box containing transcription factor Sox9 has been shown to be required for chondrocyte differentiation and for expression of cartilage-specific marker genes including type II collagen, collagen IX, collagen XI, and aggrecan (38de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R., Bi, W. Murakami S. Huang W. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 389-394Google Scholar). Sox9 was found to bind and activate a specific enhancer element in both the type II collagen (39Zhou G. Garofalo S. Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Smith C.N. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3677-3684Google Scholar) and aggrecan gene (40Sekiya I. Tsuji K. Koopman P. Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Shinomiya K. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10738-10744Google Scholar), and its expression profile was correlated with that of collagen II during the chondrogenesis process (41Ng L.J. Wheatley S. Muscat G.E. Conway-Campbell J. Bowles J. Wright E. Bell D.M. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Koopman P. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 108-121Google Scholar). Therefore, it was interesting to examine Sox9 expression in the present experimental protocol to investigate the potential implication of this transcription factor in the IL-6-induced effect on matrix gene expression by chondrocytes.DISCUSSIONWe show here that IL-6 activates JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways in the primary bovine articular chondrocyte system. Furthermore, blockage of STAT phosphorylation by parthenolide results in the inhibition of IL-6-induced down-regulation of type II collagen, aggrecan core and link protein gene expression. On the other hand, inhibition of MAP kinase pathway by PD 098059 does not significantly alter the cytokine effect on transcriptional activity of these matricial genes. These results demonstrate for the first time that the JAK/STAT pathway is essential for IL-6 signaling responses in chondrocytes, including down-regulation of cartilage-specific ECM components.Chondrocytes play an essential role in regulating the balance between ECM degradation and synthesis and their primary function to maintain cartilage ECM integrity is significantly altered in both inflammatory and degenerative joint diseases because of changed levels of local growth factors and cytokines (53Poole A.R. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1994; 53: 3-5Google Scholar, 54Muir H. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 1039-1048Google Scholar). IL-6 was initially considered as a proinflammatory cytokine-like tumor necrosis factor-Î± and IL-1, because of its IL-1-like effects on immune and hepatic cells. Recently, the cytokine has been shown to enhance the aggrecanase-mediated proteoglycan catabolism in articular cartilage (55Flannery C.R. Little C.B. Hughes C.E. Curtis C.L. Caterson B. Jones S.A. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 549-553Google Scholar). Elevated IL-6 levels in serum and synovial fluids correlate with inflammatory and erosive arthritides (11Desgeorges A. Gabay C. Silacci P. Novick D. Roux-Lombard P. Gruau G. Dayer J.M. Vischer T.L. Guerne P-A. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 1510-1516Google Scholar, 16Hirano T. Matsuda T. Turner M. Miyasaka N. Buchan G. Tang B. Sato K. Shimizu M.

Arthritis Rheum. 1988; 31: 784-788Google Scholar, 18Sack V. Kinne R. Marx T. Heppt P. Bender S. Emmrich F. Rheumatol. Int. 1993; 13: 45-51Google Scholar, 19Madhok R. Crilly A. Watson J. Capell H.A. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1993; 52: 232-234Google Scholar, 20Kaneko S. Satoh T. Chiba J., Ju, C. Inoue K. Cytokines Cell. Mol. Therapy. 2000; 6: 71-79Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± can also stimulate the production of IL-6 by articular cartilage chondrocytes (56Bender S. Haubeck H.-D. Van de Leur E. Dufhues G. Schiel X. Lauwerijns J. Greiling H. Heinrich P.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 321-324Google Scholar, 57Guerne P.A. Carson D.A. Lotz M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 499-505Google Scholar). As previously reported by others (34Guerne P.A. Desgeorges A. Jaspar J.M. Relic B. Peter R. Hoffmeyer P. Dayer J.M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 253-260Google Scholar,55Flannery C.R. Little C.B. Hughes C.E. Curtis C.L. Caterson B. Jones S.A. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 549-553Google Scholar), we found that the effect of IL-6 requires the presence of its soluble receptor (sIL-6R) in the culture medium. This is probably because of the fact that levels of membrane-anchored IL-6 receptor (gp80) on chondrocytes are very low compared with those on other cell types such as hepatocytes (34Guerne P.A. Desgeorges A. Jaspar J.M. Relic B. Peter R. Hoffmeyer P. Dayer J.M. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 253-260Google Scholar). However, high amounts of sIL-6R are found in synovial fluid of arthritic patients (5â40 ng/ml) (11Desgeorges A. Gabay C. Silacci P. Novick D. Roux-Lombard P. Gruau G. Dayer J.M. Vischer T.L. Guerne P-A. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 1510-1516Google Scholar) and are likely to participate in the signaling of IL-6 in both synovial cells and articular chondrocytes. Although the concentrations used here, which were chosen to demonstrate more efficiently the IL-6 action, may appear greater than those found in the joint of arthritic patients, it was clear here that the effect could already be detected for equivalent doses.IL-6, as other members of the IL-6-type cytokines, including oncostatin M, are known to induce the JAK/STAT signaling cascade in other systems (2Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Google Scholar) but this has not been shown in chondrocytes. Our demonstration that IL-6 triggers phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, STAT1, and STAT3 in primary cultures of articular chondrocytes suggest that these cells, together with the synoviocytes, could be a source of activated STAT1 and STAT3 found in the synovial fluid and fibroblasts of patients with RA (58Yokota A. Narazaki M. Murata N. Tanaka T. Kishimoto T. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40 Suppl. 9: S274Google Scholar, 59Wang F. Sengupta T.K. Zhong Z. Iwashkiv L.B. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1825-1831Google Scholar). Interestingly enough, we demonstrate here for the first time that the IL-6-induced activation of the JAK/STAT pathway results in down-regulation of three important specific genes of cartilage, type II collagen, aggrecan core and link proteins, suggesting that IL-6 not only contributes to cartilage erosion by inducing degradative enzymes but also via reduction of ECM synthesis. Indeed, parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone previously found as an effective inhibitor of IL-6-type cytokine by blocking STAT phosphorylation (43Sobota R. Szwed M. Kasza A. Bugno M. Kordula T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 267: 329-333Google Scholar), was capable of abolishing the STAT DNA-binding and the subsequent IL-6 inhibition of the three ECM genes transcription. Although the inhibitor was also shown to block the activation of NF-ÎºB in other systems, we did not detect any significant effect of IL-6 on this transcription factor in our experimental conditions. Interestingly enough, putative STAT3 regulatory sites have been already reported in the promoter or first intron regions of the genes for rat type II collagen, human and rat link protein, and rat stromelysin (metalloprotease-3), suggesting that these are target genes for the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (60Rhodes C. Yamada Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2305-2313Google Scholar, 61Krebsbach P.H. Nakata K. Bernier S.M. Matano O. Miyashita T. Rhodes C.S. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4298-4303Google Scholar). Similarly, a potential STAT sequence has been found in the promoter of the human aggrecan gene, which may confer responsiveness to cytokines of the IL-6 family (62Valhmu W.B. Palmer G.D. Dobson J. Fischer S.G. Ratchiffe A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6196-6202Google Scholar). Work is in progress to determine whether these putative STAT binding sites are actually implicated in the expression control of these genes in articular chondrocytes. However, the fact that the promoters of these genes share similar STAT elements strongly suggests that they are coordinately regulated by IL-6, as observed in this study.We found here that in the presence of parthenolide, the MAP kinase pathway was already activated in the controls (in the absence of IL-6/sIL-6R), as shown by increased phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 on the Western blots. This clearly indicates that an interaction exits between the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways in articular chondrocytes. To this regard, it has been demonstrated in a recent report that there is a balanced activation of the SHP-2/Ras/Erk and STAT signaling cascades emanating from gp130 (63Ernst M. Inglese M. Waring P. Campbell I.K. Bao S. Clay F.J. Alexander W.S. Wicks I.P. Tarlinton D.M. Novak U. Heath J.K. Dunn A.R. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 189-203Google Scholar). The authors have generated mice with a COOH-terminal gp130ÎSTAT âknock-inâ mutation that deletes all STAT-binding sites, but still permits activation of SHP-2/Ras/Erk pathway. Gp130ÎSTAT mice phenocopied mice deficient for IL-6 (impaired humoral and mucosal immune and hepatic acute phase responses) and LIF (failure of blastocyst implantation). However, unlike mice with null mutations in any of the components of the gp130 signaling pathway, gp130ÎSTAT mice also displayed gastrointestinal ulceration and a severe joint disease with features of chronic synovitis and degradation of the articular cartilage. Interestingly enough, a mitogenic hyper-responsiveness of synovial cells was found, resulting from the sustained gp130-mediated SHP-2/Ras/Erk activation because of impaired STAT-mediated induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins, which normally limits gp130 signaling. These data identified the importance of STAT signals in promoting inhibitory feedback signals on gp130 and the associated SHP-2/Ras/Erk pathway, thereby reinforcing the concept that the two pathways are under reciprocal negative control (64Ohtani T. Ishihara K. Atsumi T. Nishida K. Kaneko Y. Miyata T. Itoh S. Narimatsu M. Maeda H. Fukada T. Itoh M. Okano H. Hibi M. Hirano T. Immunity. 2000; 12: 95-105Google Scholar).Our study indicates that Sox9, a key factor of type II collagen and aggrecan expression, is down-regulated by IL-6/sIL-6R association at both mRNA and protein levels. This suggests that Sox9 may play a role in the molecular mechanism whereby the cartilage-specific matrix gene expression is inhibited by IL-6 associated to its soluble receptor, through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The observed correlation between Sox9 inhibition and down-regulation of matrix gene expression under the IL-6/sIL-6R effect suggests a link between this transcription factor and the STAT proteins in the mechanisms controlling the transcriptional activity of these matricial genes. How Sox9 may cooperate with the STATs at the level of DNA-binding activity and subsequent modulation of type II collagen, aggrecan core and link protein gene transcription remains to be elucidated.Finally, our data strongly suggest that the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway by inflammatory cytokines of the IL-6-type mediates a change in the chondrocyte phenotype and loss of cartilage matrix by inhibiting the expression of specific cartilage matrix molecules, including type II collagen, aggrecan core and link proteins, that maintain the differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes. Therefore, inhibiting this signaling pathway may be an effective approach in preventing cartilage alteration induced by IL-6-type cytokines in arthritides, as it has been recently proposed (65Lewis A.J. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Biol. 1999; 3: 489-494Google Scholar, 66O'Shea J.J. Visconti R. Cheng T.P. Gadina M. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2000; 59, Suppl. I: i115-i118Google Scholar, 67Seidel H.M. Lamb P. Rosen J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2645-2656Google Scholar, 68Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Google Scholar, 69Weidler M. Rether J. Anke T. Erkel G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 447-453Google Scholar). However, because of the cross-talk between ERK and STAT pathways, already mentioned above, a combination of selective blockers may be necessary. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)1 is a pleiotropic factor that belongs to a cytokine subfamily, whose members include ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-11, oncostatin M, and cardiotrophin-1, and which share a common signal transducing molecule, gp130, in their respective complexes (1Hirano T. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 249-284Google Scholar). IL-6 family members have been shown to induce the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway in several systems (2Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Google Scholar). JAKs are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase effectors that are activated by ligand-receptor interactions, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the cytoplasmic transcription factors, STATs, which then translocate to the nucleus and act on target gene transcription. Four kinases of the JAK family and seven mammalian STATs have been identified, which may be activated individually or in combination (3Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Google Scholar). IL-6 initiates its action by binding to its receptor, which is composed of the 80-kDa ligand-binding subunit (IL-6R) and the signal-transducing subunit, gp130 (4Murakami M. Hibi M. Nakagawa N. Nakagawa T. Yasukawa K. Yamanishi K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Science. 1993; 260: 1808-1810Google Scholar). After ligand binding, the gp130 subunits aggregate into a complex consisting of the IL-6R, two gp130 molecules, and one IL-6 molecule (5Schindler C. Darnell J.E., Jr. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 64: 621-651Google Scholar). This aggregation activates the gp130-associated protein-tyrosine kinases JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, which tyrosine phosphorylate gp130, themselves, and STAT3 and -1. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3/1 occurs at a single residue (STAT3-Tyr705; STAT1-Tyr701) which is located in the conserved SH2 allowing homo- as well as heterodimerization (6Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Google Scholar). During translocation to the nucleus, STAT3 and STAT1 are specifically phosphorylated on a serine residue, a prerequisite for being fully active on gene transcription (7Zhang X. Blenis J., Li, H-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Google Scholar). However, cellular responses to IL-6 can also be implemented via gp130-mediated signaling through interaction of IL-6 with a soluble form of the IL-6R (sIL-6R), which is released by either differential IL-6R mRNA splicing or proteolytic shedding from the cell membrane (review in Ref.8Jones S.A. Horiuchi S. Topley N. Yamamoto N. Fuller G.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 43-58Google Scholar). This naturally occurring sIL-6R is present in several body fluids of patients with various diseases as well as in healthy subjects (9Frieling J.T.M. Van Deuren M. Wijdenes J. Van der Meer J.W.M. Clement C. Van der Linden C.J. Sauerwein R.W. J. Infect. Dis. 1995; 171: 469-472Google Scholar, 10Novick D. Engelmann H. Wallach D. Rubistein M. J. Exp."

There is increasing evidence that after cells lose their sensitivity to TGF-Î²-mediated growth inhibition, autocrine TGF-Î² signaling may potentially promote tumor cell motility and invasiveness. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which autocrine TGF-Î² may selectively contribute to tumor cell motility, we have generated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells stably expressing a kinase-inactive type II TGF-Î² receptor (TÎ²RII-K277R). Our data indicate that TÎ²RII-K277R is expressed, can associate with the type I TGF-Î² receptor, and block both Smad-dependent and -independent signaling pathways activated by TGF-Î². In addition, wound closure and transwell migration assays indicated that the basal migratory potential of TÎ²RII-K277R expressing cells was impaired. The impaired motility of TÎ²RII-K277R cells could be restored by reconstituting TGF-Î² signaling with a constitutively active TGF-Î² type I receptor (ALK5TD) but not by reconstituting Smad signaling with Smad2/4 or Smad3/4 expression. In addition, the levels of ALK5TD expression sufficient to restore motility in the cells expressing TÎ²RII-K277R were associated with an increase in phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 but not Smad2. These data indicate that different signaling pathways require different thresholds of TGF-Î² activation and suggest that TGF-Î² promotes motility through mechanisms independent of Smad signaling, possibly involving activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar). TGF-Î² ligands play a critical role in modulating cell growth, differentiation, plasticity, and migration. They elicit their biological effects by binding to a heteromeric complex of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, the type I and type II receptors. TGF-Î² ligands can also bind to a transmembrane proteoglycan referred to as the type III receptor, which is thought to present ligand to the signaling type I and type II receptors. Following ligand binding to the type II receptor, the type I receptor is recruited to the complex. This allows the type II receptor, which is a constitutively active kinase, to transphosphorylate and thereby activate the type I receptor (2Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. MassagueÌ J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Google Scholar). Multiple pathways have now been implicated in mediating TGF-Î² effects downstream of these receptors. These include the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (3Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 628-633Google Scholar, 4Mulder K.M.

Several small GTPases can also be activated by TGF-Î² (12Edlund S. Landstrom M. Heldin C.H. Aspenstrom P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 902-914Google Scholar) and are involved in the activation of many of the above-mentioned signaling pathways. However, the Smad pathway was the first signaling pathway identified to mediate TGF-Î² effects and remains the best characterized (reviewed in Ref.1MassagueÌ J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar). Signal transduction through the Smad pathway involves phosphorylation of a set of intracellular signaling proteins termed receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) by the activated type I receptor. Once phosphorylated, R-Smads can associate with a common mediator Smad, Smad4, translocate to the nucleus, and regulate gene transcription. In addition to the R-Smads and the common mediator Smad, Smad4, there is a distinct, structurally related class of antagonistic Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, which inhibit TGF-Î² family signals. Smad6 preferentially inhibits BMP signaling by either competing with Smad4 for binding to R-Smads (13Hata A. Lagna G. MassagueÌ J. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 186-197Google Scholar) or interfering with BMP receptor-mediated phosphorylation of Smads (14Ishisaki A. Yamato K. Hashimoto S. Nakao A. Tamaki K. Nonaka K. ten Dijke P. Sugino H. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13637-13642Google Scholar). Smad7 has been reported to inhibit both TGF-Î² and BMP signaling by binding to activated type I receptors and interfering with their ability to phosphorylate R-Smads (15Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J., Xu, Y.Y. Grinnell B.W. Richardson M.A. Topper J.N. Gimbrone M.A., Jr. Wrana J.L. Falb D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Google Scholar, 16Souchelnytskyi S. Nakayama T. Nakao A. Moren A. Heldin C.H. Christian J.L. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25364-25370Google Scholar). Although TGF-Î²1 was originally identified for its ability to cause reversible phenotypic transformation and anchorage-independent growth of fibroblasts (17Moses H.L. Branum E.L. Proper J.A. Robinson R.A. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 2842-2848Google Scholar, 18Roberts A.B. Anzano M.A. Lamb L.C. Smith J.M. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5339-5343Google Scholar), TGF-Î² can act as both a tumor suppressor and a tumor promoter (19de Caestecker M.P. Piek E. Roberts A.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1388-1402Google Scholar, 20Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 22-29Google Scholar). TGF-Î² elicits most of its tumor suppressor activity by potently inhibiting the proliferation of most epithelial cells. It is thought that escape from the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-Î² through dysregulated expression or mutational inactivation of various components of the TGF-Î² signaling pathway can contribute to tumorigenesis (21Hata A. Shi Y. MassagueÌ J. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 257-262Google Scholar, 22Kim S.J., Im, Y.H. Markowitz S.D. Bang Y.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 159-168Google Scholar, 23MassagueÌ J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Google Scholar). In addition, there is increasing evidence that after cells lose their sensitivity to TGF-Î²-mediated growth inhibition, autocrine TGF-Î² signaling may promote tumorigenesis. The importance of autocrine TGF-Î² signaling in tumor progression has been highlighted by several studies that have shown that expression of a dominant-negative type II TGF-Î² receptor (dnTÎ²RII) in various tumor cells can prevent the conversion of cells from an epithelial to an invasive mesenchymal phenotype, delay tumor growth, and reduce metastases (24Yin J.J. Selander K. Chirgwin J.M. Dallas M. Grubbs B.G. Wieser R. MassagueÌ J. Mundy G.R. Guise T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 197-206Google Scholar, 25Oft M. Heider K.H. Beug H. Curr.

These data suggest that TGF-Î² can act directly on tumor cells to promote tumor maintenance and progression. In addition to promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transformation of tumor cells, TGF-Î² can stimulate the motility of many cell types in vitro, suggesting that TGF-Î² production in vivo may enhance migration of tumor cells and thus contribute to tumor invasiveness and metastases. There is also evidence that TGF-Î² can increase cellular motility without affecting proliferation, suggesting that the effects on motility and proliferation may occur via different biochemical pathways (28Morton D.M. Barrack E.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2596-2602Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanisms by which autocrine TGF-Î² may selectively contribute to tumor cell motility, we have generated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells stably expressing dnTÎ²RII. MDA-MB-231 cells express TGF-Î² receptors (29Kalkhoven E. Roelen B.A. de Winter J.P. Mummery C.L. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1151-1161Google Scholar), secrete TGF-Î² (30Martinez-Carpio P.A. Mur C. Fernandez-Montoli M.E. Ramon J.M. Rosel P. Navarro M.A. Cancer Lett. 1999; 147: 25-29Google Scholar), and, although they are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-Î² (29Kalkhoven E. Roelen B.A. de Winter J.P. Mummery C.L. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J. van der Saag P.T. van der Burg B. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1151-1161Google Scholar), can respond to TGF-Î² with an increase in spreading (31Arnoletti J.P. Albo D. Granick M.S. Solomon M.P. Castiglioni A. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Cancer. 1995; 76: 998-1005Google Scholar) and invasiveness (32Farina A.R. Coppa A. Tiberio A. Tacconelli A. Turco A. Colletta G. Gulino A. Mackay A.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 721-730Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that blocking TGF-Î² signaling by administration of a neutralizing TGF-Î² antibody can inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell tumorigenicity and metastases in nude mice (33Arteaga C.L. Hurd S.D. Winnier A.R. Johnson M.D. Fendly B.M. Forbes J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2569-2576Google Scholar). In this paper we show that expression of dnTÎ²RII in MDA-MB-231 cells impairs their basal migratory potential. This impairment in motility can be restored by expression of a constitutively active type I TGF-Î² receptor (ALK5TD) but not by overexpression of Smad2/4 or Smad3/4. In addition, the levels of ALK5TDexpression sufficient to restore motility in the cells expressing dnTÎ²RII are associated with an increase in phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2, but not Smad2, suggesting that Smad signaling is dispensable for autocrine TGF-Î²-mediated motility and that this response depends on alternative signaling pathways activated by TGF-Î². The MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The SW480.7 clone 15.13 (34Calonge M.J. MassagueÌ J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33637-33643Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Joan MassagueÌ (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) and was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 0.3 mg/ml Zeocin, and 0.7 mg/ml G418. TGF-Î²1 and BMP2 were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Peter ten Dijke (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) graciously provided the rabbit polyclonal sera directed against activin-like receptor kinases (ALKs) (35ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzen P. Laiho M. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Science. 1994; 264: 101-104Google Scholar). Antibodies against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (catalog number sc-7392), the type II TGF-Î² receptor (catalog number sc-220), Smad4 (catalog number sc-7966), and p38 MAPK (catalog number sc-7972) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to fibronectin (catalog number F14420) and Smad2/3 (catalog number S66220) were from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). The C-terminal phospho-Smad2 antibody (catalog number 06-829) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The C-terminal phospho-Smad1 antibody (catalog number 9511) and the phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (catalog number 9211S) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal antibodies to actin (catalog number A-4700) and the FLAG epitope (catalog number F3165), as well as the polyclonal antibody to Î±-catenin (catalog number C2081), were obtained from Sigma. Phalloidin-Texas Red and Hoechst 3342 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). LY294002, SB202190, and JNKiII were purchased from Calbiochem. The MEK inhibitor, UO126, was purchased fromPromega (Madison, WI). To generate MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing dnTÎ²RII, we obtained a construct encoding a kinase-inactive TÎ²RII mutant in which the lysine at position 277 has been mutated to arginine (pGABE-TÎ²RII-K277R) (25Oft M. Heider K.H. Beug H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1243-1252Google Scholar) from Martin Oft (UCSF, San Francisco, CA). Lysine 277 corresponds to an invariant lysine found in the ATP-binding site of subdomain II in all protein kinases, and even its substitution with arginine results in loss of kinase activity (36Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. MassagueÌ J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Google Scholar). The pGABE vector is a modified version of the commonly used retroviral vector pBABE in which the puromycin cassette has been replaced by enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). In this construct, TÎ²RII-K277R is HA-tagged, and its expression is driven by the viral long terminal repeat, whereas expression of GFP is driven by the SV40 promoter. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with the control pGABE vector or the pGABE-TÎ²RII-K277R vector utilizing LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, cells expressing GFP were sorted by flow cytometry. Clones were then isolated by sorting individual cells from the >95% positive GFP pool. 125I-TGF-Î²1 was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Near confluent MDA-MB-231 cells, as well as clones and pools stably expressing GFP alone (GABE) or GFP and TÎ²RII-K277R (dnTÎ²RII) in 12-well plates, were washed three times over 30 min with 500 Î¼l of ice-cold 0.1% bovine serum albumin dissolved in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (d-PBS) containing Ca2+ and Mg2+. The cells were then affinity labeled with 100 pm125I-TGF-Î²1 as described previously (37Dumont N. O'Connor-McCourt M.D. Philip A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: 57-66Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, after a 3-h incubation with 100 pm125I-TGF-Î²1 at 4 Â°C, the cells were washed with 500 Î¼l of ice-coldd-PBS, and the ligand-receptor complexes were cross-linked with 400 Î¼l of 1 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3; Pierce) for 10 min on ice. The cross-linking reaction was stopped with the addition of 100 Î¼l of 500 mmglycine. Cells were washed twice with 500 Î¼l of d-PBS and solubilized with 125 Î¼l of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 2 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 2 Î¼g/ml pepstatin, and 2 Î¼g/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Solubilized material was centrifuged for 10 min at 4 Â°C to pellet cell debris. The supernatants were transferred to one-fifth volume of 5Ã electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled, and vortexed. All samples were analyzed using 3â12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. For immunoprecipitation experiments, the radiolabeled cell lysate from a T75 flask was centrifuged at 5000 Ãg, and the supernatant was split into eight equal aliquots and incubated with antibodies directed against ALKs 1, 2, and 5, the type II TGF-Î² receptor, or HA overnight at 4 Â°C. Aliquots of radiolabeled cell lysates incubated with normal rabbit serum or no antibody were used as controls. Cells were washed twice with ice-coldd-PBS and lysed with 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 2 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 2 Î¼g/ml pepstatin, and 2 Î¼g/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Protein content was quantitated utilizing the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Protein extracts were separated by 7.5% or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 100 volts for 2 h. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBS-T plus 2.5% nonfat dry milk over night at 4 Â°C. The membranes were then washed four times for 10 min with TBS-T, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and rewashed four times for 10 min with TBS-T. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Cells grown on glass coverslips (22 Ã 22 mm) in 35-mm wells were washed twice with d-PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in d-PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in d-PBS for 60 min, all at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with primary mouse monoclonal antibodies diluted in 1% nonfat dry milk/d-PBS for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times with d-PBS, followed by incubation with a CY3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody in 1% nonfat dry milk/PBS for an additional hour at room temperature. In some experiments, cell nuclei were stained with 1 Î¼g/ml Hoechst for 10 min at room temperature. After three 10-min washes with d-PBS, coverslips were mounted onto 25 Ã 75-mm microslides using AquaPolyMount (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Fluorescent images were captured using a Princeton Instruments cooled CCD digital camera from a Zeiss Axiophot upright microscope. Cells were transiently transfected with 1 Î¼g per 35-mm dish of the Smad-dependent heterologous promoter reporter construct p(CAGA)12-Luciferase (38Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Google Scholar) provided by Dr. Jean-Michel Gauthier (Laboratoire Glaxo Wellcome, Les Ulis Cedex, France) along with 0.01 Î¼g per 35-mm dish of pCMV-Renilla using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The following day, cells were split into 24-well plates, and â¼45 h post-transfection, cells were either left unstimulated or were stimulated with 40 pm TGF-Î²1 for 16â20 h. All cells were then washed with d-PBS and lysed. Firefly and Renilla reniformis luciferase activities were measured using Promega's dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity was normalized utilizing the ratio of Firefly to R. reniformis luciferase activity and presented as -fold induction. All assays were done in triplicate wells, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. For wound closure assays, confluent cell monolayers were wounded by manually scraping the cells with a pipette tip. Following wounding, wound size was verified with an ocular ruler to ensure that all wounds were the same width. The cell culture medium was then replaced with fresh medium, and wound closure was monitored by microscopy at various times. Transwell motility assays were performed utilizing 5-Î¼m pore, 6.5-mm polycarbonate transwell filters (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). For these assays, single cell suspensions were seeded in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin onto the upper surface of the filters and allowed to migrate toward various concentrations of FCS. After a 16â20-h incubation period, cells on the upper surface of the filter were wiped off with a cotton swab, and the cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were fixed, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and counted by brightfield microscopy at Ã200 in five random fields. The adenoviral construct encoding FLAG-tagged Smad4 (39McDonnell M.A. Law B.K. Serra R. Moses H.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 265-273Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Harold Moses (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). All other adenoviral constructs encoding FLAG-tagged Smads or HA-tagged constitutively active mutants of the TGF-Î² (ALK5T204D), activin (ALK2Q207D), and BMP (ALK3Q233D) type I receptors (40Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. Kohei Miyazono (Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan). Stocks of recombinant viruses for each of these constructs were generated in 293 cells and titered utilizing the Takara assay (Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were then infected with these or a control Î²-galactosidase adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) that resulted in >90% cell infection (â¼15 plaque-forming units/cell or less). The efficiency of infection was evaluated by in situ staining of cells for Î²-galactosidase activity 48 h following infection. To abrogate TGF-Î² signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells, an expression vector encoding GFP and kinase-inactive TÎ²RII was transfected into cells. Expression of the kinase-inactive TÎ²RII-K277R mutant was verified by affinity labeling cell surface receptors with 125I-TGF-Î²1 (Fig. 1 A). Because TÎ²RII-K277R has an intact extracellular domain, it can still bind TGF-Î² and should therefore co-migrate with endogenous TÎ²RII. Cell surface labeling of parental cells resulted in the labeling of three proteins corresponding to the endogenous type I, II, and III TGF-Î² receptors. There was little or no change in the amount of receptor labeling observed in the control cells expressing GFP alone (GABE 15 Pool) compared with parental cells. However, in the pool expressing TÎ²RII-K277R (dnTÎ²RII 15 Pool), there was a significant increase in the amount of labeled type II receptor, suggesting that the exogenous receptor was expressed. Individual clones obtained from each of these pools expressing either GFP alone (G15â5, -6) or GFP and TÎ²RII-K277R (dn15â2, -3, -5, -11) displayed a similar pattern of labeling. To confirm that this increase in the labeling of TÎ²RII was indeed because of expression of the HA-tagged TÎ²RII-K277R, extracts from affinity labeled cells were immunoprecipitated with an HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the HA antibody immunoprecipitated a labeled type II receptor in the pool and clones expressing TÎ²RII-K277R but not in the control pool or clones expressing GFP alone, confirming transgene expression. The type I TGF-Î² receptor appeared to co-immunoprecipitate with TÎ²RII-K277R in these experiments. This was confirmed in subsequent co-immunoprecipitation experiments (see Fig. 2). Having ascertained that TÎ²RII-K277R was expressed, we then examined whether it was functional. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that when affinity labeled cells expressing TÎ²RII-K277R were precipitated with an HA antibody, a labeled protein the size of a type I receptor co-precipitated with TÎ²RII-K277R (see Fig. 1 B and Fig. 2,right panel, lane 8). We confirmed that this was TÎ²RI by precipitating similarly labeled cells with various TGF-Î² superfamily type I receptor antibodies, including ALK1, -2, and -5. Only the ALK5 (TÎ²RI), but not the ALK1 or ALK2 antibodies, precipitated the cross-linked type I receptor (Fig. 2). Although the TÎ²RII antibody co-precipitated ALK5 efficiently, the ALK5 antibody co-precipitated TÎ²RII only weakly (see Fig. 2, lane 5,both panels). In the control GABE 15 Pool, the HA antibody failed to precipitate any proteins, as expected. Immunoprecipitations with a TÎ²RII antibody were carried out in both pools as a positive control, and both resulted in the co-precipitation of TÎ²RI (Fig. 2,lane 7, both panels). These data indicate that TÎ²RII-K277R associates with TÎ²RI. To determine whether TÎ²RII-K277R prevented TGF-Î² signaling, we examined its effect on the ability of TÎ²RI to phosphorylate Smad2. Immunoblot analysis of TGF-Î²1-treated cell lysates using a phospho-specific Smad2 antibody revealed that although TGF-Î²1 could induce phosphorylation of Smad2 in both GABE clones (G15â5 and G15â6), its ability to do so in the TÎ²RII-K277R clones (dn15â2, -3, -5, -11) was impaired (Fig. 3 A). This impairment was not because of a decrease in total Smad2 protein, as reprobing with an antibody directed against total Smad2/3 did not reveal any significant change in protein levels. We next examined the effect of TÎ²RII-K277R expression on TGF-Î²-induced Smad translocation to the nucleus by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3 B). In the GABE clone Smad2 staining was relatively diffuse, but upon TGF-Î²1 treatment for 60 min, Smad2 staining became concentrated in the nucleus. In contrast, in the TÎ²RII-K277R clones, there was little or no change in Smad2 staining following TGF-Î²1 treatment, suggesting impaired TGF-Î²-mediated translocation of Smad2 to the nucleus. We then examined the effect of TÎ²RII-K277R on TGF-Î²1-induced transcription. A reporter construct containing twelve Smad binding elements repeated in tandem, p(CAGA)12-Luciferase, was transiently transfected into the GABE and TÎ²RII-K277R clones, along with pCMV-Renilla. Normalized luciferase activity indicated that TGF-Î²1 could induce transcription of both reporter constructs in the GABE clones, but its ability to do so in the TÎ²RII-K277R clones was impaired (Fig. 3 C). To determine whether signaling pathways other than the Smad pathway were also affected by expression of TÎ²RII-K277R, we examined fibronectin expression, which has been reported to be induced by TGF-Î² in a JNK-dependent but Smad4-independent manner (6Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Google Scholar). We chose to perform these experiments in our pools as the results obtained in these cells are representative of those obtained in the clones (compare phospho-Smad2 blots in Fig. 3, A andD). Following TGF-Î² stimulation for 24 h, we observed an increase in fibronectin expression in the GABE pool, but this induction was decreased significantly in the pool expressing TÎ²RII-K277R, as was the basal level of fibronectin expression (Fig. 3 D). We were unable to detect any induction of phosphorylation of JNK in response to TGF-Î² in our GABE pools (data not shown). However, we did observe an increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK following TGF-Î² stimulation for 60 min, and this induction of phosphorylation was slightly attenuated in the pool expressing TÎ²RII-K277R (Fig. 3 D). Next we examined the effect of TÎ²RII-K277R expression on the motility of MDA-MB-231 cells in a wound closure assay. In the GABE clones, cells migrated into the wounded area and closed the wound within 24 h, whereas in the TÎ²RII-K277R clones the wound remained open at 24 h (Fig. 4 A). This difference in motility did not appear to be because of an effect on proliferation, because when the experiment was performed in the presence of mitomycin C, a compound that inhibits cell division, the same results were obtained (data not shown). Thus, expression of TÎ²RII-K277R in MDA-MB-231 cells appears to impair their motility, independent of changes in proliferation. As an alternative measure of cell motility, we also examined the effect of TÎ²RII-K277R on the ability of cells to migrate in a transwell assay system. We observed a 3- to 4-fold reduction in the ability of cells expressing TÎ²RII-K277R to migrate toward FCS, as compared with control cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 4 B). Because the impaired motility of TÎ²RII-K277"

However, the intracellular mechanism(s) involved in nicotine suppression of apoptosis is unclear. Bcl2 is a potent antiapoptotic protein and tumor promotor that is expressed in both small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. It is possible that nicotine may regulate Bcl2 to stimulate cell survival. Here we report that nicotine can induce Bcl2 phosphorylation exclusively at the serine 70 site in association with prolonged survival of SCLC H82 cells expressing wild-type but not the phosphorylation-deficient S70A mutant Bcl2 after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents (i.e. cisplatin or VP-16). Nicotine induces activation of PKCÎ± and the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2, which are physiological Bcl2 kinases. Furthermore, ET-18-OCH3, a specific phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor, blocks nicotine-stimulated Bcl2 phosphorylation and promotes apoptosis, suggesting that PLC may be involved in nicotine activation of Bcl2 kinases. Using a genetic approach, the gain-of-function S70E mutant, which mimics Ser70 site phosphorylation in the flexible loop domain, potently enhances chemoresistance in SCLC cells. Thus, nicotine-induced cell survival results, at least in part, from a mechanism that involves Bcl2 phosphorylation. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies for lung cancer in which Bcl2 is expressed may be used to abrogate the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl2 by inhibiting multiple upstream nicotine-activated pathways.

These nAChRs are transmembrane cationic channels that are activated on cholinergic stimulation (7Garnier M. Lamacz M. Tonon M.C. Vaudry H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This reaction produces two intracellular messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which mediate the intracellular Ca2+release and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) that can trigger a downstream kinase cascade leading to activation of the Raf/MEK/ERKs cell growth pathway (16Rhee S.G.

Bcl2 is a cellular proto-oncogene that functions as a potent antiapoptotic molecule, and its dysregulation can be oncogenic (18Linette G.P. Hess J.L. Sentman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1995; 86: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A correlation between heavy cigarette smoking and increased expression of Bcl2 in patients with lung, head, or neck cancer suggests that Bcl2 may be a target of carcinogens found in tobacco smoke (19Gallo O. Bianchi S. Porfirio B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1024-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We previously discovered that phosphorylation of Bcl2 at Ser70 by growth factor-activated protein kinases including PKC and the MAPKs (ERK1/2) can positively regulate the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl2 (17Deng X.

Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1033-1040PubMed Google Scholar) and MAPK (ERK2) in association with prolonged survival of human lung cancer cells in culture (5Heusch W.L. Maneckjee R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, the downstream survival substrate(s) of nicotine-activated PKC and MAPK/ERK2 has not been identified. Therefore, we tested whether nicotine-mediated enhancement of tumor cell survival may occur, at least in part, through the functional phosphorylation of Bcl2 and how nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation affects the chemoresistance of lung cancer cells. Anti-Bcl2, Bax, PKCÎ±, ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, p38, and phospho-specific ERK p38 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Nicotine, etoposide (VP-16), and cisplatin were obtained from Sigma. ET-18-OCH3 was purchased from Calbiochem. NCI-H69 cell line and human Bcl2 cDNA were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All reagents used were obtained from commercial sources unless otherwise stated. NCI-H82 and NCI-H69 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. Nucleotides corresponding to each serine or threonine residue inBcl2 cDNA were substituted to create a conservative alteration to alanine or glutamic acid with a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). Each single mutant was confirmed by sequencing of the cDNA and was then cloned into the pCIneo mammalian expression vector (Promega). The pCIneo plasmid containing each Bcl2 mutant cDNA was transfected with NCI-H82 cells by electroporation. Clones stably expressing WT or mutant Bcl2 were selected in a medium containing G418 (0.6 mg/ml). The expression levels of exogenous Bcl2 were compared by Western blot analysis. Three separate clones for each mutant expressing similar amounts of exogenous Bcl2 were selected for further analysis. Cells were washed with phosphate-free RPMI medium and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 60 min. After agonist or inhibitor addition, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in detergent buffer, and Bcl2 was immunoprecipitated as described previously (17Deng X.

The samples were subjected to 10â20% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for the times indicated at â80 Â°C. Bcl2 phosphorylation was determined by autoradiography. The same filter was then probed by Western blot analysis with a Bcl2 antibody and developed by using an ECL Kit (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (20Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). PKCÎ± was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with PKCÎ± antibody after nicotine treatment. Immunoprecipitated PKCÎ± was suspended in 50 Î¼l of kinase assay buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 Î¼m CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 Î¼g/ml histone-1, 100 Î¼m ATP, 100 Î¼g/ml phosphatidylserine, 2 Î¼Ci of [Î³-32P]ATP, and 0.03% Triton X-100. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 30 Â°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 Ã SDS sample buffer and boiling of the sample for 5 min. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The activities of PKCÎ± were determined by autoradiography. Bcl2 phosphorylation using purified activated PKCÎ± (Panvera, Madison, WI), ERK1, or ERK2 (Calbiochem) was performed as described previously (17Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B.K. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The apoptotic and viable cells were detected using an ApoAlert Annexin-V kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of annexin-Vlow cells (percentage of viable cells) or annexin-Vhigh cells (percentage of apoptotic cells) was determined using the data obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described (23Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Cell viability was also confirmed using the trypan blue dye exclusion method (20Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Nicotine is a survival agonist that inhibits apoptosis after various stresses (6Wright S.C. Zhong J. Zheng H. Larrick J.W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1045-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular signal transduction mechanism(s) involved in nicotine suppression of apoptosis is not clear. Bcl2 is the first identified survival gene involved in the control of apoptosis (24Gajewski T.F. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). High levels of endogenous Bcl2 are expressed in some human lung carcinoma cells that include SCLC and NSCLC (25Ikgaki N. Katsumata M. Minna J. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of Bcl2 can positively regulate the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl2 (17Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B.K. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 20Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), it is possible that nicotine-induced cell survival may be associated with Bcl2 phosphorylation. To test this possibility, NCI-H69 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bcl2 (25Ikgaki N. Katsumata M. Minna J. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar) were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine. The result indicates that nicotine can potently stimulate endogenous Bcl2 phosphorylation in human SCLC NCI-H69 cells (Fig. 1). Cisplatin and VP-16 are currently the most useful clinical drugs for treatment of patients with lung cancer (26Niell H.B. Curr. Treat. Options. Oncol. 2001; 2: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To test the effect of nicotine on the regulation of apoptosis, NCI-H69 cells expressing high levels of endogenous Bcl2 were treated with cisplatin or VP-16 in the absence or presence of nicotine for various times. Cell death was assessed as described under âExperimental Procedures.â The viability curve shows that nicotine significantly prolongs cell survival after treatment with either cisplatin or VP-16 (Fig. 1 B). These findings reveal that nicotine-induced increased cell survival is closely associated with Bcl2 phosphorylation. Data represent the mean Â± S.D. of three determinations. Our previous findings indicate that the growth factor interleukin-3 can induce Bcl2 phosphorylation exclusively at Ser70 and potently promote cell survival (17Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B.K. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 20Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). However, under certain stress situations such as the exposure of cells to paclitaxel, Bcl2 can also be phosphorylated at multiple sites including Thr69, Ser70, and Ser87(27Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). To identify nicotine-induced phosphorylation sites, a series of serine/threonine â alanine mutants, including T69A, S70A, and S87A, was created to abrogate each individual site phosphorylation. WT and alanine mutants were stably transfected in another type of SCLC NCI-H82 cells. We chose this cell line because NCI-H82 cells contain very low levels of endogenous Bcl2 (25Ikgaki N. Katsumata M. Minna J. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the survival function of individual Bcl2 mutants could be more accurately evaluated because any possible effect from endogenous Bcl2 on cell survival could be avoided. Three clones for each mutant expressing similar levels of exogenous WT and Ala mutant Bcl2 were selected and tested, and representative results for one clone are shown. Because nicotine induces the phosphorylation of WT, T69A, and S87A, but not S70A Bcl2 (Fig. 2 A), these findings indicate that nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation occurs exclusively at Ser70, whereas the Thr69 and Ser87phosphorylation sites are not involved. Importantly, nicotine can protect WT, T69A, and S87A but not S70A Bcl2-expressing cells from apoptosis after treatment with the clinically useful chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin (Fig. 2 B). These findings suggest that Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70 may be required for nicotine-induced lung cancer cell survival. To further demonstrate genetically whether Ser70 site Bcl2 phosphorylation affects chemoresistance in human SCLC cells, a serine â glutamate mutant at Ser70 was created to mimic Ser70 site phosphorylation. It is well known that substitution at the serine phosphorylation site using glutamate can mimic the charge conferred by phosphorylation (28Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 29Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, S70E Bcl2 mutant could functionally mimic Ser70 site Bcl2 phosphorylation. Interestingly, cells expressing S70E mutant Bcl2 represent a gain-of-function anti-apoptotic phenotype that mimics nicotine-stimulated survival (Fig. 2). These comparative results provide genetic evidence that Ser70 site phosphorylation potently enhances the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl2, which may result in chemoresistance in human SCLC cells. Our findings indicate that nicotine can induce Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70 in human lung cancer cells (Fig. 2). However, the protein kinase(s) involved is not clear. Because PKCÎ± and MAPK ERK1/2 can directly phosphorylate Bcl2 in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3; Ref. 17Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B.K. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we tested whether nicotine might activate either of these Bcl2 kinases to phosphorylate Bcl2 in SCLC cells. Time course experiments indicate that nicotine induces activation of PKCÎ± and ERK1/2 with a peak at 30 min (Fig. 4, A and B). By contrast, nicotine has no effect on either JNK1 or p38, respectively (Fig. 4, C and D). These findings suggest that nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation may occur through activation of PKCÎ± and/or ERK1/2.Figure 4Nicotine activates PKC Î± and ERK1/2 but not JNK and p38 protein kinases, which can be inhibited by staurosporine and PD98059. A, NCI-H82 cells expressing WT Bcl2 were treated with nicotine (1 Î¼m) for various times. PKCÎ± was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and incubated with purified histone-1 in an in vitro kinase assay as described under âExperimental Procedures.â Reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or Western blot using PKCÎ± antibody.BâD, cells were treated with nicotine for various times as described in the legend for Fig. 1 A. The cells were harvested, washed, and lysed in detergent buffer at the indicated times. Western blot analysis was performed to detect phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) or total ERK1/2 by using a phospho-specific ERK antibody or a mixture of ERK1 and ERK2 antibodies. The same filter was reprobed with phospho-specific JNK1, phospho-specific p38 or JNK1, p38 antibodies, respectively.E and F, cells were treated with nicotine (1 Î¼m) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of PD98059 or Stauro for 30 min. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 were analyzed as described in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Staurosporine (Stauro) is a potent PKC inhibitor, whereas PD98059 can specifically inhibit MEK-1-induced ERK1 or ERK2 activation (30Tamaoki T. Nomoto H. Takahashi I. Kato Y. Morimoto M. Tomita F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 135: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar, 31Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar). Because either PD98059 or Stauro can inhibit nicotine-induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 4, E and F), PKC may be indirectly upstream of ERK1/2 in the nicotine-stimulated kinase cascade. These pharmacological data strongly suggest that nicotine-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation may be dependent on PKC activity. To further test whether PKCÎ± and MAPK/ERK1/2 are involved in nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation and cell survival, NCI-H82 cells expressing WT Bcl2 were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid and treated with nicotine in the absence or presence of Stauro or PD98059 or their combination. The results show that Stauro or PD98059 potently inhibit nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A). Because SB20219, a p38-specific inhibitor, has no effect on nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A), we can conclude that PKCÎ± and ERK1/2 but not p38 are involved in nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation. More importantly, Stauro and PD98059, but not SB20219, significantly reduce nicotine-induced survival after treatment with the clinically relevant chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin (Fig. 5 B). These findings reveal that nicotine-activated PKC and EPK1/2 may be required for Bcl2 phosphorylation, and inhibition of PKC and/or MAPK ERK1/2 kinase activities in SCLC cancer cells may be critical for the suppression of nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation and survival. To identify which type of receptor(s) may be involved in nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation in human SCLC cells, hexamethionium (a nAchR blocker) (32Brain K.L. Trout S.J. Jackson V.M. Dass N. Cunnane T.C. Neuroscience. 2001; 106: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and ET-18-OCH3 (a selective phospholipase C inhibitor) (33Strassheim D. Shafer S.H. Phgelps S.H. William C.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2730-2736PubMed Google Scholar) were tested for their effects on Bcl2 phosphorylation. Interestingly, ET-18-OCH3 but not hexamethionium inhibits both nicotine-induced activation of ERK1/2 and Bcl2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, A and B). These findings suggest that nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation may occur through the nonclassical nicotine receptor that couples phospholipase C to trigger the downstream physiological Bcl2 kinase cascade (PKC and ERK1/2) in SCLC cells. Importantly, ET-18-OCH3 but not hexamethionium also blocked nicotine-induced survival after treatment with cisplatin (Fig. 6 C). Thus, ET-18-OCH3 may have potential clinical use as a novel anti-cancer drug in treating SCLC that expresses Bcl2. Nicotine induces Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70 in the flexible loop domain in association with cell survival, but the molecular mechanism is not clear. Recent reports suggest that phosphorylation not only facilitates the ability of Bcl2 to associate with the proapoptotic protein, Bax (17Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B.K. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), but also stabilizes the Bcl2 protein that serves to maintain mitochondrial integrity (34Deng X. Gao F. Mai H. May W.S. Blood. 2001; 98 (Abstr. 3311): 796aGoogle Scholar, 35Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To test whether nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation affects Bcl2/Bax heterodimerization, H82 cells expressing WT Bcl2 and Bax were treated with nicotine in the absence or presence of various concentrations of ET-18-OCH3. Total Bcl2 was determined by quantitative immunoprecipitation using a Bcl2 antibody. Bax-associated Bcl2 (i.e. bound Bcl2) was co-immunoprecipitated by using Bax antibody. After Western blot analysis, the relative amount of Bcl2 or Bax was determined by densitometry. Results indicate that approximately 40% of total Bcl2 associates with Bax under normal growth conditions and that the Bax-associated Bcl2 is increased to 85% of total Bcl2 after nicotine treatment (Fig. 7 A). This increase represents an approximately 2-fold increase compared with control (i.e. 40 versus 85%). Because nicotine can induce Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70 (Fig. 2), and enhance Bax/Bcl2 association, this increased association may occur, at least in part, through Ser70 phosphorylation. To assess whether inhibition of Bcl2 phosphorylation affects Bax/Bcl2 association, ET-18-OCH3 was used to test this possibility. Results reveal that ET-18-OCH3 can reduce Bax/Bcl2 association in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, no change occurs in total Bcl2 level (Fig. 7 A). Because ET-18-OCH3 can potently inhibit nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation at Ser70(Fig. 6 B), it is possible that phosphorylation at Ser70 may be necessary for Bax/Bcl2 association. To test this hypothesis genetically, Bax/Bcl2 association was assessed in H82 cells expressing the gain-of-function mutant S70E or nonphosphorylatable S70A Bcl2. Results reveal that approximately 95% of S70E Bcl2 associates with Bax during growth conditions. By contrast, only 25% of S70A Bcl2 binds Bax (Fig. 7 B). The total Bcl2 levels of S70E and S70A are the same (Fig. 7 B). These findings suggest that phosphorylation of Bcl2 at the Ser70site may be necessary for maximal association with Bax and represents one potential mechanism by which Bcl2 phosphorylation regulates its antiapoptotic activity. Bcl2 and related family members are key regulators of programmed cell death or apoptosis, a natural process required for normal development, malignant transformation, and autoimmune disease (36Yang E. Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4754) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that phosphorylation of Bcl2 in the flexible loop domain can positively regulate the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl2 and that growth factor (i.e. interleukin-3 or nerve growth factor) -induced phosphorylation is associated with cell survival (20Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar,38May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstrong D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19022-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation at Ser70 may be required for Bcl2's potent antiapoptotic function, and nicotine induces Bcl2 phosphorylation exclusively at Ser70 (Fig. 2), nicotine may mimic growth factor or survival agonist(s) and functionally activate Bcl2 by phosphorylation. Because nicotine promotes survival in cells expressing WT but not the phosphorylation-deficient S70A Bcl2 mutant, we conclude that the nicotine-induced cell survival and chemoresistance that occur in human SCLC cells may result, at least in part, from nicotine-stimulated Ser70 Bcl2 phosphorylation. A recent report indicates that nicotine can also up-regulate Bcl2 in NSCLC H157 cells, but the mechanism remains unclear (5Heusch W.L. Maneckjee R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It is possible that nicotine-induced up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl2 results from phosphorylation, because this post-translational modification potently enhances the stability of Bcl2 protein (34Deng X. Gao F. Mai H. May W.S. Blood. 2001; 98 (Abstr. 3311): 796aGoogle Scholar,35Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Nicotine activates both PKCÎ± and ERK1/2 but has no effect on JNK1 and p38 activities (Fig. 4). Staurosporine and PD98059 not only block nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation but also promote cell death (Fig. 5). These data suggest that nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation occurs through a pathway involving activation of PKC and/or the ERK1/2 kinases. PLC is an important and well described molecular mediator of cell survival and proliferation in both SCLC and NSCLC cells (33Strassheim D. Shafer S.H. Phgelps S.H. William C.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2730-2736PubMed Google Scholar). Nicotine has been reported to induce PLC activation through a nonclassical nicotine receptor signal pathway (7Garnier M. Lamacz M. Tonon M.C. Vaudry H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11743-11747Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activated PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to generate both phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol second messengers (7Garnier M. Lamacz M. Tonon M.C. Vaudry H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11743-11747Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Zhang S. Day I.N.M. Ye S. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 5: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate increases cytosolic Ca2+ concentration by releasing Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum, which may facilitate activation of classical PKCs (9Zhang S. Day I.N.M. Ye S. Physiol. Genomics. 2001; 5: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol directly activates PKC, which can trigger a Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 kinase cascade to induce Bcl2 phosphorylation (10Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. The American Society for Cell Biology, Garland, NY1994Google Scholar, 17Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B.K. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). ET-18-OCH3 is a PLC-specific inhibitor that can block nicotine-induced MAPKs ERK1/2 activation and Bcl2 phosphorylation in association with apoptosis, whereas hexamethonium, a nAChR inhibitor (33Strassheim D. Shafer S.H. Phgelps S.H. William C.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2730-2736PubMed Google Scholar), has no effect (Fig. 6). These data indicate that nicotine-induced survival and/or chemoresistance may occur through activation of the nonclassical nicotine-receptor signal transduction pathway involving PLC/PKC/ERK/Bcl2 in SCLC cells. Nicotine does not activate JNK1 or p38 and the p38-specific inhibitor SB20219 has no effect on nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation (Figs. 4 and 5); these findings indicate that JNK and p38 are not involved in nicotine/Bcl2 survival signaling. Thus, PLC, PKC, and ERK1/2 are nicotine-specific events that may be therapeutically targeted using ET-18-OCH3, Stauro, and PD98059 to inhibit nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation. These findings may have potential clinical relevance in strategies designed to enhance chemosensitivity in patients with Bcl2 expressing lung cancer. In contrast with our (17Deng X. Ruvolo P.

Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 42Srivastava R.K. Srivastava A.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Nesterova M. Cho-Chung Y.S. Longo D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). If this were the case, it is difficult to reconcile how forced overexpression of Bcl2 can significantly prolong cell survival after exposure to paclitaxel (40Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our genetic evidence does not support the notion that phosphorylation inactivates Bcl2 because expression of S70E Bcl2 mutant more potently inhibits lung cancer cell death than cells expressing WT or nonphosphorylatable alanine mutants in the absence of nicotine (Fig. 2). These findings directly demonstrate that Ser70 site phosphorylation enhances the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl2, which may be associated with increased chemoresistance in SCLC cells. We recently reported that phosphorylation of Bcl2 at Ser70stabilizes its heterodimeric interaction with Bax (17Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B.K. May W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), a proapoptotic molecule required for cell death (43Wei M. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K. MacGregor G. Thompson C. Korsmeyer S. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3297) Google Scholar). Our data support and extend these findings, because nicotine stimulates not only Ser70site Bcl2 phosphorylation but also Bcl2/Bax heterodimerization (Fig. 7), a mechanism currently thought to block the death action of Bax (44Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar). ET-18-OCH3 also potently inhibits both nicotine-induced Bcl2 phosphorylation and Bcl2/Bax heterodimerization in association with apoptosis, further suggesting that inhibition of Bcl2 phosphorylation may facilitate Bcl2/Bax dissociation, which may trigger the proapoptotic function of Bax. In summary, the findings reported here identify a novel nicotine-stimulated survival signal pathway that involves Bcl2 phosphorylation in human SCLC cells. Nicotine may activate PLC through receptor-coupled G protein-linked activation (7Garnier M. Lamacz M. Tonon M.C. Vaudry H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11743-11747Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that triggers a downstream kinase cascade (i.e. PKC and ERK1/2) to functionally phosphorylate Bcl2 and thereby prolong cell survival (Fig. 8). These findings may help to develop a novel strategy for treatment of human SCLC by blocking the nicotine-activated Bcl2 kinase cascade.

https://openalex.org/W2316896018,"The tumor suppressor protein p53, once activated, can cause either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis through transactivation of target genes with p53 DNA binding sites (DBS). To investigate the role of p53 DBS in the regulation of this profound, yet poorly understood decision of life versus death, we systematically studied all known and potential p53 DBS. We analysed the DBS separated from surrounding promoter regions in yeast and mammalian assays with and without DNA damage. p53 efficiently utilized the DBS of MDM2 and of genes connected to cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and the death receptor pathway of apoptosis. However, p53 was unable to utilize two-thirds of the isolated DBS, a subset that included almost all DBS of apoptosis-related genes. Neither ASPP2, a p53-interacting protein reported to specifically stimulate p53 transcriptional activity on apoptosis-related promoters, nor DNA damage resulted in p53 utilization of isolated DBS of apoptosis-related genes. Thus, a major regulation of p53 activity occurs at the level of p53 DBS themselves by posing additional requirements for the successful utilization of apoptosis-related DBS."

Lonetto M. Losick R. McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 129-176Google Scholar). Thus, the levels and binding properties of alternative Ï-subunits together with factors that modulate their ability to associate with core RNA polymerase are critical for the relative composition of the multiple holoenzymes available for transcription of the distinct promoter classes within the prokaryotic genome. The seven different Ï-factors of E. coli fall into two groups. The larger of these comprises six factors that share notable sequence and functional similarities to the major ÏD (Ï70)-factor that is responsible for transcribing âhousekeepingâ genes (2Lonetto M.

Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In addition, there are significant differences in the action of the cognate holoenzymes at promoters. Unlike EÏD, which can undergo transition from the initial closed complex to the transcriptionally competent open complex without any other regulatory factor, the EÏN closed complex is kinetically and thermodynamically stable and EÏN cannot melt promoter DNA on its own. Transition to the open complex is dependent on interaction with, and nucleotide hydrolysis by, a member of the bacterial family of enhancer binding proteins (reviewed in Ref. 8Buck M. Gallegos M.T. Studholme D.J. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Promoters of the ÏN-dependent â24, â12 class direct transcription of genes involved in a variety of physiological processes responsive to nutrient limitation such as nitrogen assimilation and fixation, substrate-specific transport systems, and utilization of alternative carbon and energy sources. Appropriate environmental signals lead to activation of the cognate regulator by diverse mechanisms that result in a common active form of the regulator (9Shingler V. Mol.

For DmpR, which controls transcription of the ÏN-Po promoter of an operon encoding the enzymes for metabolism of (methyl)phenols in Pseudomonas CF600, the activation mechanism is direct. Binding of aromatic phenolic pathway substrates to its N-terminal regulatory A-domain alleviates interdomain repression to give the active form of the protein (10Ng L.C. O'Neill E. Shingler V. J.

Biol. 2001; 314: 971-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition to the specific DmpR-mediated control mechanism described above, transcription from the ÏN-Po promoter is dependent on the unusual nucleotides guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and guanosine pentaphosphate (pppGpp), collectively referred to as (p)ppGpp. These molecules are heralds of metabolic stress and were originally identified as the mediators of the classical stringent response to down-regulate superfluous stable RNA synthesis upon amino acid starvation (reviewed in Refs. 14Cashel M. Gentry D. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R.I. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

Synthesis of these molecules by ribosome-associated RelA (p)ppGpp synthetase is activated by the arrival of an uncharged tRNA on the ribosome, whereas the dual function SpoT protein (which is primarily responsible for (p)ppGpp degradation) catalyzes (p)ppGpp synthesis in response to glucose starvation (16Xiao H.

Down-regulation of transcription from stringent promoters is believed to occur through the effects of binding of (p)ppGpp at the interface of the Î²- and Î²â²-subunit of RNA polymerase (28Chatterji D. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 29Toulokhonov II Shulgina I. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol.

Binding of (p)ppGpp destabilizes EÏD-promoter complexes, and, because open complexes formed by EÏD at rRNA P1 promoters are intrinsically very unstable, it has been proposed that these promoters are likely to be particularly sensitive to (p)ppGpp destabilization (30Gourse R.L. Gaal T. Aiyar S.E. Barker M.M. Estrem S.T. Hirvonen C.A. Ross W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Support for this mechanism comes from analysis of suppressor mutations within Î² and Î²â² (isolated by rescue of the polyauxotrophic growth defect of (p)ppGpp-deficient strains) that also destabilize ÎÏD-promoter open complexes in vitro (31Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough C.L., Jr. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 32Bartlett M.S. Gaal T. Ross W. Gourse R.L. J. Mol.

One possible consequence of down-regulation of transcription from the powerful stringent promoters is an increase in the pool of core RNA polymerase that is normally sequestered in producing these abundant transcripts. Thus, accumulation of (p)ppGpp and, by analogy, suppressor mutations has been proposed to increase the amount of EÏD available for (p)ppGpp-stimulated ÏD-promoters that are difficult to saturate and have EÏD recruitment as the rate-limiting step (33Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 34Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol.

The seven Ï-factors of E. coli exhibit quite different affinities for core RNA polymerase (reviewed in Ref. 36Ishihama A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 499-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and (p)ppGpp has the potential to play multiple roles in their function. In addition to the potential to directly alter the promoter recognition and kinetics of transcriptional initiation at promoters, (p)ppGpp could also plausibly modulate the Ï-association properties of the core RNA polymerase. Models involving the influence of (p)ppGpp on Ï-factor competition for limiting available core have been put forward to explain poor induction of ÏS- and ÏH-dependent promoters in (p)ppGpp-deficient cells (20Farewell A. Kvint K. NystroÌm T. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1039-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Kvint K. Farewell A. NystroÌm T. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Most recently evidence for a direct effect of (p)ppGpp on the competitive abilities and levels of ÏSand ÏH associated with core RNA polymerase has been presented (22Jishage M. Kvint K. Shingler V. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Primarily based on the ability of two mutations in ÏD to restore transcription to a ÏN-dependent promoter in the absence of (p)ppGpp, we have previously postulated that modulation of Ï-factor competition may at least in part underlie the (p)ppGpp dependence of the Po promoter that requires the action of the structurally and functionally distinct ÏN protein (25Sze C.C. Shingler V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we dissect the potential of (p)ppGpp to directly affect ÏN-dependent Po transcription and to modulate ÏN competition by (i) identifying new suppressor mutations that restore transcription from Po in (p)ppGpp-deficient cells and (ii) performing in vivo and in vitroÏ-factor competition in the presence and absence of (p)ppGpp. We present evidence that (i) the levels of alternative Ï-factors have a large impact on the output from the Po promoter and (ii) the requirement for (p)ppGpp can be suppressed by four mutations in ÏD that exhibit defects in competition against ÏN, or by underproduction or sequestering of ÏD. These results strongly support a model in which (p)ppGpp serves as a master regulator of transcription through Ï-factor competition for limiting core RNA polymerase and brings the performance of the structurally and functionally distinct ÏN protein within the global control of the stringent response. Strains used are listed in TableI and were routinely cultured and assayed in Luria broth (LB; Ref. 38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Where indicated, assays were also performed using rich defined medium consisting of M9 minimal medium (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

E. coliMG1655Îlac and CF1693Îlac strains carrying Ptrpâ rpoD were generated by transferring (CAMÎ©) Ptrpâ rpoD from E. coliMC4100 (CAMÎ©) Ptrpâ rpoD into these strains by P1-mediated transduction using the tetracycline resistanceaer-3075::Tn10 marker and testing for chloramphenicol resistance and/or indole-3-acrylic acid (IAA) dependence. Prior to analysis, all the rpo alleles were introduced in clean genetic backgrounds by P1-mediated transduction exploiting the thi-39::Tn10 marker forrpoBC alleles,aer-3075::Tn10 for rpoDalleles, and zhc-6::Tn10 for therpoN allele. DNA sequencing was used to monitor co-transduction of the mutant alleles. Suppressor phenotypes were assessed using a Po-luxAB reporter and the ability of the strains to grow on M9 minimal media plates supplemented with 10 mm glucose and 100 Î¼g/ml thiamine.Table IBacterial strainsStrainRelevant genotype/phenotype1-aThe ability of mutantrpo alleles to restore prototrophy to the (p)ppGpp-deficient host was determined as described under âExperimental Procedures.âSource/reference1-bE. coli genetic stock center.CAG121521-cOnly the designation of the genetic marker is given; map locations are from Ref. 58.aer-3075â·Tn10 marker at 69.3 minsECGSCCAG121531-cOnly the designation of the genetic marker is given; map locations are from Ref. 58.zhc-6â·Tn10 marker at 72.5 minsECGSCCAG185001-cOnly the designation of the genetic marker is given; map locations are from Ref. 58.thiC-39â·Tn10 marker at 90.4 minsECGSCCF1693ÎlacÎrelA251â·Km ÎspoT207â·Cm Îlac, (p)ppGpp+; auxotroph (26Sze C.C.

Open table in a new tab The dmpR-Po-dmpB plasmid pVI686 used as a reporter for P1-linkage analysis was assembled from previously cloned regions of the dmp cluster of Pseudomonas CF600 and consists of a 4-kb HindIII-to-SmaIdmpR-Po-spanning fragment fused to a 2.3-kbSmaI-to-HpaI dmpB encoding fragment on the RSF1010-based cloning vector pVI398. The pVI687dmpR-Po-tet selection plasmid has the same Po reporter fusion point as pVI686. Plasmid pVI687 was generated by first cloning a 2.4-kb NruI-to-SmaIdmpR-Po-spanning fragment into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ followed by insertion of aHindIII-to-KpnI fragment carrying the promoterless tetracycline resistance gene, generated from pBR322 using primers Tc1/Tc2. The in vitro transcription template plasmid pVI695 is based on pTE103 and carries an EcoRI-to-BamHI Po promoter fragment generated using primers Po1 and Po2 (Table III). This Po promoter fragment spans from â408 to +26 relative to the transcription start site and thus encompasses the DmpR binding sites (upstream activating sequences â170 to â127), the IHF binding site (â72 to â37), and the â24, â12 Po promoter (39Sze C.C. Laurie A.D. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2842-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The RpoN expression plasmid pVI688 carries the E. coli rpoN gene as an EcoRI-to-KpnI fragment spanning from 34 bp upstream of the ATG start to 7 bp downstream of the termination codon. The PCR-amplified fragment was generated using primers N1/N2 and cloned between theEcoRI-to-KpnI region of pEXT21. Plasmids pVI690 to pVI694, for expression of wild type and mutant ÏD, were generated by assembling two PCR-amplified fragments between theNdeI and EcoRI sites downstream of the expression cassette of pJLA503. Primers D1/D2 were used to generate anNdeI-to-BamHI fragment with the NdeI site encompassing the ATG start codon and extending to the internalBamHI site of MG1655 rpoD. Primers D3/D4 were used to generate BamHI-to-EcoRI fragments from wild-type or mutant rpoD derivatives to reconstitute full-length rpoD from the internal BamHI to 12 bp downstream of the termination codon. Independent cultures of E. coli CF1693Îlac harboring pVI687 (dmpR-Po-tet) were grown for 2 h with shaking at 30 Â°C in 2 ml of LB supplemented with carbenicillin (50 Î¼g/ml) and 0.5 mm 2-methylphenol (the most potent aromatic effector of DmpR). Tetracycline was then added to 20 Î¼g/ml and the culture incubated under the same conditions for another 2 h prior to dilution and plating on equivalent solid media and growth overnight at 30 Â°C. Equal numbers of large and small independent isolates were re-streaked and screened for DmpR dependence of the tetracycline resistance phenotype by testing for TcR in the presence and absence of 0.5 mm 2-methylphenol. Of the original 102 isolates, all exhibited DmpR effector-dependent tetracycline resistance. However, 33 were discarded as being unstable, P1 phage-resistant, and/or having suppressor phenotypes too poor to map by P1 transduction as described below. Given the predominance of rpoBC mutants in a previous prototrophy rescue screen (40Hernandez V.J. Cashel M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 536-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), isolates were first screened for alterations inrpoBC by using a non-isotopic RNA cleavage assay (NIRCA) kit (MutationScreenerTM) supplied by Ambion, Inc. and/or P1 transduction. For NIRCA analysis, each â¼5-kb gene was amplified by colony PCR from each mutant strain using rpoB B1/B2 andrpoC C1/C2 primers and Exp"

Recently, we showed that the âLSGGQâ motif in one NBD (531LSGGQ535 in NBD1;1176LSGGQ1180 in NBD2) is adjacent to the âWalker Aâ sequence (1070GSSGCGKS1077 in NBD2;427GNSGCGKS434 in NBD1) in the other NBD (Loo, T.

Here, we report the effect of drug binding on cross-linking between the LSGGQ signature and Walker A sites (Cys431(NBD1)/C1176C(NBD2) and Cys1074(NBD2)/L531C(NBD1), respectively). Seven drug substrates (calcein-AM, demecolcine, cis(Z)-flupentixol, verapamil, cyclosporin A, Hoechst 33342, andtrans(E)-flupentixol) were tested for their effect on oxidative cross-linking. Substrates that stimulated the ATPase activity of P-gp (calcein-AM, demecolcine, cis(Z)-flupentixol, and verapamil) increased the rate of cross-linking between Cys431(NBD1-Walker A)/C1176C(NBD2-LSGGQ) and between Cys1074(NBD2-Walker A)/L531C(NBD1-LSGGQ) when compared with cross-linking in the absence of drug substrate. By contrast, substrates that inhibited ATPase activity (cyclosporin A, Hoechst 33342, andtrans(E)-flupentixol) decreased the rate of cross-linking. These results indicate that interaction between the LSGGQ motifs and Walker A sites must be essential for coupling drug binding to ATP hydrolysis. Drug binding in the transmembrane domains can induce long range conformational changes in the NBDs, such that compounds that stimulate or inhibit ATPase activity must decrease and increase, respectively, the distance between the Walker A and LSGGQ sequences.

By contrast, substrates that inhibited ATPase activity (cyclosporin A, Hoechst 33342, andtrans(E)-flupentixol) decreased the rate of cross-linking. These results indicate that interaction between the LSGGQ motifs and Walker A sites must be essential for coupling drug binding to ATP hydrolysis. Drug binding in the transmembrane domains can induce long range conformational changes in the NBDs, such that compounds that stimulate or inhibit ATPase activity must decrease and increase, respectively, the distance between the Walker A and LSGGQ sequences. P-glycoprotein ATP-binding cassette adenosine 5â²-(Î²,Î³-imino)triphosphate nucleotide-binding domain NH2-terminal NBD COOH-terminal NBD transmembrane TM domain P-glycoprotein (P-gp)1 is an ATP-dependent drug pump that transports numerous structurally diverse compounds of different sizes out of the cell (recently reviewed in Refs. 1Ambudkar S.V.

An important aspect in understanding the mechanism of P-gp is how drug transport is coupled to ATP hydrolysis. The observation that drug binding to P-gp can either stimulate or inhibit ATP hydrolysis suggests that drug binding and ATP hydrolysis must be tightly regulated (12Doige C.A., Yu, X. Sharom F.J.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The âsignatureâ sequence (LSGGQ) in each NBD appears to be an important region in P-gp. Although the signature sequences are present in all ABC transporters (17Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar), their function is unknown. We recently showed that the LSGGQ in one NBD was close to the Walker A sequence in the other NBD (18Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We postulated that the LSGGQ sequence might play a role in conveying conformational changes from the drug-binding site to the ATP-binding sites. In this study, we examined the effect of drug substrates on cross-linking between the LSGGQ motifs and the Walker A sites. A histidine-tagged Cys-less P-gp was constructed and then used for making mutants containing pairs of cysteines (6Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two mutants that contained a cysteine in the LSGGQ site and another in the Walker A site were constructed (18Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). One mutant (L531C/Cys1074) contained a cysteine in the NH2-terminal 531LSGGQ535 site and an endogenous cysteine (Cys1074) in the COOH-terminal Walker A site (1070GSSGCGKC1077). The other mutant (Cys431/L1176C) contained the endogenous Cys431 in the NH2-terminal Walker A site (427GNSGCGKS434) and another cysteine in the COOH-terminal 1176LSGGQ1180 site. The mutant cDNAs were expressed in HEK 293 cells in the presence of cyclosporin A to promote maturation of P-gp (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar,22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared as described previously (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For disulfide cross-linking analysis, aliquots of membranes were added to equal volumes of Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mmCu2+-(phenanthroline)3. The samples were incubated at 21 or 4 Â°C for various intervals, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer (125 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 4% (w/v) SDS) containing 50 mm EDTA and no reducing agent. The reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gels) and immunoblot analysis with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp (8Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27488-27492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To test the effect of nucleotide or vanadate on cross-linking, the membranes were incubated with an equal volume of Tris-buffered saline containing the following: 1) 12 mm ATP, 24 mmMgCl2 and 0.6 mm sodium orthovanadate; 2) 12 mm ATP and 24 mm MgCl2; 3) 12 mm ATP; 4) 24 mm MgCl2; 5) 0.6 mm sodium orthovanadate; 6) 12 mm ADP; or 7) 12 mm AMP-PNP. Sodium orthovanadate was prepared from Na3VO4, pH 10 (24), and boiled for 2 min to break down polymeric species (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 Â°C and then cooled in an ice bath before treatment with oxidant at 21 Â°C. At this temperature there is almost complete cross-linking in both mutants (18Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To test the effect of drug substrates on cross-linking, the mutant P-gps were preincubated with drug substrate for 10 min at 21 Â°C, then chilled at 4 Â°C for 10 min, and then treated with oxidant. At 4 Â°C, the rate of cross-linking is also slowed, and this allowed us to detect changes in cross-linking. The purification of histidine-tagged P-gp mutants and an assay of drug-stimulated ATPase activities were done as described previously (23Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) except that the isolated samples were mixed withEscherichia coli lipid rather than sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine. E. coli lipids were used because basal P-gp ATPase activity is higher in these lipids than those with sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine. This made measuring the inhibition of P-gp ATPase activity much easier. Also, the drug-stimulated ATPase activity of P-gp reconstituted with E. coli lipids is similar to that measured in isolated mammalian plasma membranes that are enriched in P-gp (15Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We showed previously by disulfide cross-linking analysis that the contact between the NBDs of P-gp could occur between the LSGGQ signature sequence in one NBD and the Walker A site in the other NBD (18Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mutants in which the leucine residue in the LSGGQ site is replaced with cysteine can be oxidatively cross-linked with the endogenous cysteine in the opposing Walker A sequence ((L531C(NBD1-LSGGQ)/Cys1074(NBD2-Walker A) or Cys431(NBD1-Walker A)/L1176C(NBD2-LSGGQ)). Fig. 1 shows that that cross-linking was almost complete in mutants L531C/Cys1074 and Cys431/L1176C when treated with 0.5 mm copper phenanthroline for 15 min at 21 Â°C. We previously showed that cross-linking occurred in the active molecule, because cross-linking resulted in an inactive molecule. Activity was restored, however, after the addition of dithiothreitol (18Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine whether cross-linking between the NBDs could be disrupted, the mutants were pre-treated with nucleotide or subjected to vanadate trapping. P-gp traps nucleotides in the presence of vanadate plus Mg-ATP and results in a transition state (27Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 28Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Vanadate traps ADP at either NBD by occupying the position of the Î³-phosphate adjacent to ADP. Vanadate trapping at one site then inhibits ATP hydrolysis at the second ATP-binding site (27Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that inhibition of cross-linking in mutants L531C/Cys1074 and Cys431/L1176C was observed only after treatment with vanadate plus Mg-ATP. Inhibition of cross-linking was not observed when the mutants were pre-treated with ATP, MgCl2, vanadate, Mg-ATP, ADP, or with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP. It is unlikely that vanadate trapping of nucleotide denatures the protein, because trapping of nucleotide is reversible (27Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). We have proposed that the LSGGQ motifs might participate in transmitting conformational changes from the transmembrane domains to the NBDs (18Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mutations in the LSGGQ motifs do not prevent ATP binding or vanadate trapping of nucleotides (29Bakos E. Klein I. Welker E. Szabo K. Muller M. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Szakacs G. Ozvegy C. Bakos E. Sarkadi B. Varadi A. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 71-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One way of inducing different conformational changes in the TMDs is to use drug substrates with different structures. P-gp is interesting in that some drug substrates stimulate whereas others inhibit the ATPase activity of P-gp. Therefore, it is possible that the conformational changes in the TMDs may be monitored by changes in the cross-linking patterns in mutants L531C/Cys1074 and Cys431/L1176C. Drug substrates (1Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 361-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar) that either stimulated (calcein-AM, demecolcine,cis(Z)-flupentixol, and verapamil) or inhibited (cyclosporin A, Hoechst 33342, and trans(E)-flupentixol) the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp (data not shown) were identified. The flupentixol isomers are interesting in that thecis(Z)-isomer stimulates, whereas thetrans(E)-isomer inhibits the ATPase activity of wild-type P-gp (31Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These drug substrates were then tested on mutants L531C/Cys1074 and Cys431/L1176C. Fig. 2 shows that the ATPase activity of mutant L531C/Cys1074 was stimulated by calcein-AM, demecolcine, cis(Z)-flupentixol, and verapamil (6.4-, 6.8-, 3.5-, and 4-fold, respectively). Half-maximal stimulation of ATPase activity with calcein-AM, demecolcine, cis(Z)-flupentixol, and verapamil occurred at 30, 163, 29, and 9 Î¼m, respectively. Cyclosporin A, Hoechst 33342, andtrans(E)-flupentixol inhibited the activity of mutant L531C/Cys1074 with 50% inhibition occurring at concentrations of about 0.12, 0.67, and 1.1 mm, respectively. Similar results were obtained with mutant Cys431/L1176C (data not shown). We then tested whether the structurally different stimulatory and inhibitory drug substrates affected cross-linking in the NBDs. Accordingly, membranes from mutant L531C/Cys1074 were preincubated for 10 min at 21 Â°C with 1 mm calcein-AM, 2 mm demecolcine, 1 mm cis(Z)-flupentixol, 0.2 mm verapamil, 0.5 mm cyclosporin A, 0.5 mm Hoechst 33342, or 1 mm trans(E)-flupentixol. These concentrations were required for maximal stimulation or inhibition of ATPase activity (Fig. 2). The membranes were then treated with oxidant at 4 Â°C for various intervals. The rationale for doing the cross-linking at 4 Â°C was that thermal motion in the protein would be reduced and that subtle changes caused by drug substrate binding may be detected. Fig. 3 shows the effects of substrates on cross-linking of mutant L531C/Cys1074. In the absence of drug substrates, â¼50% of the mutant protein was cross-linked by 16 min. In the presence of compounds (calcein-AM, demecolcine,cis(Z)-flupentixol, and verapamil) that stimulate the ATPase activity of P-gp, however, the rate of cross-linking was significantly increased so that 50% cross-linking occurred by 2 min. The presence of the inhibitory compounds (cyclosporin A, Hoechst 33342, andtrans(E)-flupentixol) had the opposite effect. In the presence of these inhibitors, <50% cross-linking was observed at 32 min (Fig. 3). We then tested the effect of drug substrates on cross-linking of mutant Cys431/L1176C. In the absence of drug substrates, 50% of the mutant protein was cross-linked with an oxidant after 16 min (Fig. 4). In the presence of the stimulatory drug substrates (calcein-AM, demecolcine,cis(Z)-flupentixol, and verapamil), the rate of cross-linking was increased, because 50% of the mutant protein was cross-linked by 2â4 min. Drug substrates that inhibited ATPase activity (cyclosporin A, Hoechst 33342, andtrans(E)-flupentixol) of the mutant P-gp also inhibited the cross-linking of the mutant protein. Fig. 4 shows that in the presence of these compounds <50% cross-linking occurred at 32 min. The effect of substrates on mutants L531C/Cys1074 and Cys431/L1176C were very similar. Compounds that stimulated the ATPase activity also stimulated the rate of cross-linking of the mutants, whereas those that inhibited ATPase activity also inhibited the rate of cross-linking. It is unlikely that drug substrates are binding directly to the ATP-binding sites, because it has been shown that drug binding does not alter the affinity for ATP (15Urbatsch I.L. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Chen D. Hrycyna C.A. Dey S. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I.

A. 1992; 89: 8472-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Disulfide cross-linking between adjacent cysteines in the Walker A sequence of one NBD and the LSGGQ site in the other NBD is a useful approach for monitoring changes in the NBDs. A condition that dramatically affects cross-linking between these two sites occurs after vanadate trapping of a nucleotide (Fig. 1). Hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of vanadate was essential for the inhibition of cross-linking because cross-linking was not inhibited in the presence of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP. Similarly, cross-linking was not inhibited when the mutants were pre-incubated with only ATP, MgCl2, ADP, vanadate, or Mg-ATP. These results indicate that the trapped vanadate either occupies the space between the cross-linkable cysteines in the LSGGQ and Walker A sites in the two NBDs or that its presence causes the two NBDs to move apart. The drug-binding site in the TMDs (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 34Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and the ATP binding sites in P-gp must be quite far apart. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies indicate that the ATP-binding sites are about 40 â« from the drug-binding site (35Qu Q. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1413-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our results show that binding of drug substrates must induce conformational changes in the drug-binding site that are transmitted distally to the NBDs. Similarly, conformational changes in the NBDs are also transmitted to the drug-binding site in the TMDs (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, there must be continuous âcross-talkâ among the domains of P-gp. The LSGGQ sequence can increase or decrease the rate of ATP hydrolysis depending on its distance from the Walker A site as shown in Fig. 5. Inhibitory substrates may cause both of the Walker A and LSGGQ sites to move farther apart and/or reduce the rate of ATP hydrolysis. In this study, the inhibitory substrates reduced the rate of cross-linking, and this may occur by moving the two NBDs apart (Figs. 3 and 4). Drug substrates that stimulate ATPase activity of P-gp must bring the Walker A and LSGGQ sites closer together so that hydrolysis of ATP occurs at a faster rate. There is no detailed crystal structure information about eukaryotic ABC transporters. Recent crystal structure studies on other ABC transporters such as Rad50cd (36Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S.

It is likely that as the LSGGQ motif moves closer to the Walker A site, the rate of ATP hydrolysis increases. Our results support this idea and may explain why a substrate is a stimulator or inhibitor of P-gp. These results could form the basis for the development of better inhibitors of P-gp."

Apolipoprotein A-I is the major protein component of high density lipoprotein particles and plays a key role in the solubilization of lipids in these particles, the activation of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase, the binding of high density lipoprotein to cell surfaces, and the promotion of cholesterol efflux from cells (17Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of apoA-I and other lipoproteins has indicated that these proteins contain repeated amphipathic helices, and this was confirmed in the crystal structure of truncated human apolipoprotein A-I (residues 44â243, i.e. Î43) (18Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These helices, 11 or 2 Ã 11 residues in length, make up the lipid binding regions of the proteins. The pattern of hydrophobic residues in the lipoprotein helical repeats is similar to the canonical heptad repeat of Î±-helical coiled coil proteins (19Creighton T.E. Proteins Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993: 193-195Google Scholar). It has been known for some time that apoA-I undergoes major structural changes when going from the free to the lipid-bound forms (20Leroy A. Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the N-terminal 98 residues are responsible for maintaining a stable, lipid-free structure of apoA-I and that a conformational switch in residues 1â43 reveals a latent lipid binding domain (21Rogers D.P. Roberts L.M. Lebowitz J. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The shared ancestry of the lipoproteins and the conformational plasticity required for activity may underlie the observed common amyloidogenic nature of the lipoproteins. In predictions of the secondary structure of apoA-I, the N terminus has proved the most difficult to assign, and this may reflect the conformational switching that occurs upon lipid binding. A detailed analysis by Nolte and Atkinson (22Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) assigned random coil to residues 1â8, helix to 9â13, Î²-structure from 14 to 22, coil or turn from 23 to 33, possible helix to 34â40, and well defined helix between residues 55 and 83. The crystal structure of the Î43 truncated form of the protein, which has been shown by biochemical and biophysical studies to have an overall structure similar to lipid-bound apoA-I (18Borhani D.W. Rogers D.P. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12291-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), has coil structure between residues 44 and 49 and well defined helical structure in the rest of the molecule. The amyloidogenic N-terminal fragment of apoA-I forms long, straight amyloid fibrils with a dominant cross-Î²-structure similar to that seen in all other forms of amyloid (12Dobson C.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 68: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, we have recently shown that elements of ordered, oriented helical structure are present in some preparations of apoA-I amyloid material, notably in material purified from two different patients with amyloid composed of apoA-I-(1â93) and expressing the L174S mutation (23Mangione P. Sunde M. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Esposito G. Gianelli L. Obici L. Asti L. Andreola A. Viglino P. Merlini G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The superstructure of apoA-I amyloid can apparently accommodate some residual helical structure, whereas the dominant stabilizing structure is Î²-sheet. The successful purification of fragment 1â93 fromex vivo tissue has made possible the study of the process of fibrillogenesis in this polypeptide. It has not been possible to produce this fragment in recombinant expression systems to date as it is very unstable and sensitive to bacterial proteases. 2D. Booth, personal communication. Here we have been able to use material purified from patients to study the pathway of fibril formation and to probe the environmental triggers that may initiate the conformational switching. These results may shed light on the process of amyloid formation in the whole family of lipoproteins that appears to be particularly susceptible to the formation of these stable aggregates. Amyloid fibrils were extracted from patient PER by the water extraction procedure of Pras et al. (24Pras M. Schubert M. Zucker-Franklin D. Rimon A. Franklin E.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 47: 924-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described in Mangioneet al. (23Mangione P. Sunde M. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Esposito G. Gianelli L. Obici L. Asti L. Andreola A. Viglino P. Merlini G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The protein was then purified by gel filtration in the presence of 5 m guanidine hydrochloride. After the removal of denaturant by dialysis against water, the protein was lyophilized and then resolubilized in water in a concentrated stock solution. The polypeptide extracted from the fibrils was submitted to N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry as previously described (23Mangione P. Sunde M. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Esposito G. Gianelli L. Obici L. Asti L. Andreola A. Viglino P. Merlini G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra were measured with a PerkinElmer LS50 spectrofluorimeter at 20 Â°C with excitation at 295 nm. ApoA-I-(1â93) was dissolved at a concentration of 0.06 mg/ml in 3 mm glycine, 3 mm sodium acetate, and 3 mm sodium phosphate adjusted to a pH range from 3 to 8. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Magna 560 spectrometer (Madison, WI) purged with N2 and equipped with a MCT/A detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. The samples, typically 250 Î¼l, were loaded into an ATR cell prepared for liquid samples and sealed with Teflon stoppers. The internal reflection element accessory was a trapezoidal (50 Ã 2 Ã 20 mm) 25-reflection germanium plate from Grasby Specac (Kent, UK). A cavity for the sample was created using a 0.5-mm-thick Teflon spacer between the internal reflection element and the metal plate. Spectra were collected at room temperature and without a polarizer. ApoA-I-(1â93) was dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 10 mm d 3-acetate pH* 7.4 (corrected for deuterium effects) and incubated overnight to allow H/D exchange. The pH* of solution was adjusted to 4, and 300 interferograms were collected at a resolution of 1 cmâ1 (collection lasted approximately 1 min), which were averaged and processed with zero filling Happ-Genzel apodization. Data were collected at regular times over a period of 16 h. Natural full-length (lipid-free) apoA-I and apoA-I fibrils were both obtained from patient PER as previously described (23Mangione P. Sunde M. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Esposito G. Gianelli L. Obici L. Asti L. Andreola A. Viglino P. Merlini G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both specimens were dissolved in 10 mm d3-acetate pH* 7.0 (corrected for deuterium effects) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated overnight before the spectral analysis. Electron micrographs were acquired using a Phillips CM100 electron microscope operating at 80 keV. The FT-IR sample at pH* 4 was centrifuged, the fibrils were resuspended in filtered Milli-Q water, and the suspension of fibrils was applied to a Formvar-coated copper grid. This was blotted, negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (w/v), pH 7, air-dried, and then examined. Circular dichroism spectra were collected on a JASCO 810 spectropolarimeter using cuvettes of 1-mm path length. Samples of apoA-I-(1â93) at a final concentration of 0.336 mg/ml in 3 mm glycine, 3 mm sodium acetate, and 3 mm sodium phosphate at pH 4 and 7 were incubated in aqueous TFE solutions of different molar ratios between 0 and 40% and with a range of DHPC concentrations from 0 to 15 mm. Spectra were corrected for base line using the spectrum of appropriate buffer alone. The mean residue ellipticity [Î¸] was calculated from the equation [Î¸] = Î¸/(cnl/M r) wherel is the path length in cm, Î¸ is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, c is the concentration of protein (mg/ml),n is the number of amino acid residues, andM r is the molecular weight. The apoA-I-(1â93) polypeptide was purified from ex vivo material and displayed the N-terminal sequence of mature apoA-I and a molecular mass of 10720 Da. As previously shown, it adopts a random coil conformation at neutral pH in aqueous buffer (23Mangione P. Sunde M. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Esposito G. Gianelli L. Obici L. Asti L. Andreola A. Viglino P. Merlini G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Knowing that the polypeptide assumes a cross-Î² conformation in the amyloid fibrils, we initially probed the acquisition of more compact structure by monitoring the total tryptophan fluorescence signal arising from the three tryptophan residues at positions 8, 50, and 72. It is clear from Fig. 1 a that the pH of the solution has an effect on the protein conformation such that the environment of the tryptophans is altered. The tryptophan emission maximum of a protein usually shifts from shorter wavelengths to around 350 nm, the fluorescence maximum of tryptophan in aqueous solution, when proteins are unfolded. At neutral pH the fluorescence emission maximum from apoA-I-(1â93) is at 347 nm, but this shifts to close to 341 nm at pH 3, consistent with transfer of the tryptophan side chains into a hydrophobic environment and the development of a more compact structure. Studies of full-length apoA-I inn-propyl alcohol buffered with Tris at pH 8.2 indicate that in this helix-inducing solvent, mimicking the effect of lipids, the wavelength of maximum fluorescence occurs at 342 nm (only one other Trp occurs outside of the N-terminal amyloidogenic fragment, at position 108). Leroy and Jonas postulate (20Leroy A. Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that the similarities in the spectroscopic properties observed in apoA-I in 30% n-propyl alcohol and in reconstituted high density lipoprotein were such that it was likely that most of the Trp residues are in or near a helix but are accessible to solvent. In the recombinant high density lipoprotein complexes the phospholipids make contact with the tryptophans and shield them from solvent. Strikingly, our CD data from polypeptide 1â93 suggested that the structural collapse from a predominantly unstructured form at neutral pH (Fig. 1 b), presenting a minimum at 203 nm, was accompanied by acquisition of helical structure at lower pH (Fig. 1 c) in which the minima are at 208 and 222 nm. The helical conformation induced at pH 4 is not stable, however (Fig. 2), and the formation of insoluble material is observed after â¼5 min. This is accompanied by loss of CD signal. The polypeptide in a helical conformation at pH 4 appears to undergo intermolecular association and precipitation.Figure 2Loss of CD signal with time. Far-UV CD spectra of apoA-I-(1â93) at pH 4 and time 0 h (â), pH 4 and time 3 h (â), pH 7 and time 0 h (â ), and pH 7 and time 3 h (âª).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have used FT-IR spectroscopy to follow the formation of aggregates at low pH because this technique can be used for monitoring secondary structure changes in a mixture of soluble and insoluble material. The loss of helical signal and the increase in Î²-structure that accompanies the formation of aggregates are illustrated in Fig. 3 a. After the pH of the solution was adjusted to 4, acquisition of spectra was initiated rapidly and continued over a period of 16 h. After 5 min at pH 4, an increase in the signal at 1615 and 1684 cmâ1 was observed. The signal centered at 1615 cmâ1 corresponds to the contribution of Î²-structure, and the signal at 1684 cmâ1 is specific for the presence of anti-parallel Î²-structure. After 12 h the process of conversion into Î²-sheet is complete. This can be compared with the FT-IR spectra at pH 3 and 7 (Fig. 3 b) and with the spectrum of amyloid fibrils purified from patient PER (Fig. 3 c). These are particularly interesting because they contain a substantial residual helical element (1655 cmâ1), and this information is consistent with the Î±-helical component we have detected by x-ray diffraction in natural fibrils (23Mangione P. Sunde M. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Esposito G. Gianelli L. Obici L. Asti L. Andreola A. Viglino P. Merlini G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The search for fibrils in the aggregate was performed by electron microscopy every 24 h, and apparently only after 72 h at 4 Â°C, under these acidic conditions, very long, straight fibrils were detected by negative stain electron microscopy (Fig. 4). The material analyzed by electron microscopy does not display fibrillar structure in the first 72 h. The lag phase between the Î±- to Î²-structure conversion and the fibril formation is not surprising, in general, for protein fibrillogenesis. In the case of apoA-I in particular, the coexistence of non-fibrillar aggregate and typical amyloid fibrils is noted in the natural fibrils analyzed by atomic force microscopy in which the non fibrillar aggregate has a globule like structure presenting a mean height around 4.5 nm. 3A. Relini et al., manuscript in preparation. Therefore, it is possible that the process of fibrillogenesis in vitro requires a slow conversion of oligomeric aggregates into long fibrils, and it is likely that an equilibrium of the two states of association exists in vivo. Unfortunately the relatively small amounts of material available have so far made the alignment of fibrils for x-ray fiber diffraction and comparison of in vitro and ex vivo fibrils impossible.Figure 4Electron microscopy. Electron micrograph of FT-IR sample at pH* 4 (corrected for deuterium effects).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Some fibrillar material was also detected after incubation at pH 7, although the fibrils formed under these conditions were not as long or as straight as those produced at pH 4. Full-length apoA-I has also been shown to form fibrils in vitro at pH 7, and at least some fragments of apoA-I appear to be colocalized with AÎ² in senile plaques (25Wisniewski T. Golabek A.A. Kida E. Wisniewski K.E. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 238-244PubMed Google Scholar). The apoA-I-(1â93) peptide was incubated with a range of concentrations of DHPC at pH 4 and pH 7 to study the effect of a lipid environment on this lipid-associated protein (Fig. 5). This is a short (6-carbon) chain phospholipid that exhibits a critical micelle concentration of 16 mm (26Johnson R.E. Wells M.A. Rupley J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4239-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and behaves as a detergent micelle in aqueous solution rather than forming lipid bilayers. The low dielectric constant medium provided by the lipid acyl chains promotes the formation of Î±-helical structure, possibly by increasing intramolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic and dipolar interactions and decreasing competition with water. At pH 4, the effect of low concentrations of DHPC (up to 7.5 mm) is to induce some helical structure into the polypeptide, but this form is not stable and, with time, signal is lost. With increasing DHPC concentration (from 10 mm and above), the helical conformation is stabilized to a point where no signal is lost over 3 h (Fig. 6). Increasing the DHPC concentration beyond this point increases the strength of the helical signal slightly. At pH 7, concentrations of DHPC up to 10 mm have only a limited effect on the conformation of the peptide. Above 10 mm DHPC, a decrease in the ellipticity at 222 nm indicates that some helix is present, but the spectra suggest that there is a substantial coil element present. This altered conformation appears to be stable at pH 7. DHPC appears to be able to induce some helical structure under favorable pH conditions and to mask intermolecular interactions that can occur between molecules in the helical form. Therefore, high concentrations of this short chain lipid prevent fibril formation at low pH but do not induce helical conformation at pH 7.Figure 6Effect of DHPC and time on the conformation of apoA-I -(1â93). The far-UV CD spectra of the polypeptide incubated at pH 4 with 0 mm DHPC (â), 5 mmDHPC (â ), 10 mm DHPC (â), and 15 mm DHPC (âª).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To study the role of the helical conformation in apoA-I-(1â93) fibrillogenesis, the polypeptide was incubated with a range of TFE concentrations at pH 4 and at pH 7 (Fig. 7). TFE can promote Î±-helical structure in proteins and polypeptides (27MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1203-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but high concentrations of TFE have been used to destabilize the native states of proteins and to populate amyloidogenic forms of proteins such as acylphosphatase (28Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3594Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar) as well as to induce fibril formation in an amphipathic peptide derivative of apo C-II (29Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The presence of TFE induces a strong helical signal from apoA-I-(1â93) at both pH 4 and 7, and this helical form is stable in TFE, presumably because of increased intramolecular hydrogen bonding and a reduced hydrophobic effect. More TFE is required to induce or to stabilize equivalent amounts of helix at pH 4 than at pH 7. Therefore there is an apparent dichotomy between a high intrinsic tendency to populate a helical structure at low pH and the apparent requirement for higher concentrations of TFE to produce equivalent amounts of helical structure at pH 4 and at pH 7. This may be explained by the formation of intermolecular coiled-coil structure at low pH. As discussed previously, the 1â93 peptide is predicted to form a coiled-coil structure in the full-length protein. An analysis of the relative ellipticity exhibited at 222 and 208 nm can distinguish between the coiled-coil structure and the Î±-helical structure (30Kiss R.S. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4327-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A 222:208 ellipticity ratio of â¼1 indicates interhelical contacts, whereas values around 0.9 suggest helix without interhelical contacts. We have measured the ellipticity ratio for apoA-I-(1â93) at pH 4, and we obtain a ratio of 1.07 in the absence of TFE and 0.87 in the presence of 40% TFE, suggesting interacting helices in the absence of TFE but loss of these contacts in the presence of the solvent. At pH 7, the ratio falls to 0.78 at 20% TFE. We propose that there may be a competing effect of the TFE at pH 4 to destabilize the coiled-coil interactions on the one hand and to stabilize the Î±-helical structure on the other, and higher concentrations are therefore required to stabilize equivalent amounts of helical structure compared with pH 7. At pH 7, the helix induced by 20% TFE is stable. However, the same proportion of TFE at pH 4 appears to accelerate the loss of signal and, by inference, precipitation. These results appear to support the idea that the formation of these amyloid aggregates requires the peptide to pass from its random conformation through a helical conformation to the stable Î²-sheet structure. If all of the polypeptide material is stabilized in this helical form, with masking of intermolecular interactions, then aggregation and fibril formation are prevented. No development of soluble Î²-structure was observed during fibril formation by this apoA-I polypeptide, and this is different to what has been reported in numerous amyloidogenic peptide systems and also in other lipoproteins that form amyloid (31Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.L. Howlett G.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Instead, the aggregating conformer that is transiently populated below the pI (4.35) is mainly helical, and the conformational switching to form fibrils with Î²-structure occurs after precipitation. The mean hydrophobicity and the net charge of apoA-I full-length and truncated 1â93 were calculated as suggested by Uverskyet al. (32Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar) and are reported in Fig. 8. Through these parameters it was also possible to calculate the âboundaryâ mean hydrophobicity value, (H)boundary, by means of the equation (33Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar) (H)boundary = (R + 1.151)/2.785. This equation, in which R corresponds to the mean net charge of the polypeptide, predicts a natively unfolded state for proteins that have a mean hydrophobicity below the (H)boundary value. Both full-length apoA-I and the polypeptide 1â93 fulfil the requirements for natively unfolded proteins. There is clearly an effect of pH on this amyloidogenic polypeptide; the helical conformation is populated at pH values below the pI, and the polypeptide has a random coil structure at neutral pH. The sequence of apoA-I is very rich in charged residues. Of the 93 residues, 20 are negatively charged (10 Asp and 10 Glu), and 11 are positively charged (4 Arg and 7 Lys) (Fig. 8). Protonation of the acidic residues appears to be the trigger for the transient helix formation and subsequent intermolecular association and conversion to Î²-structure. At neutral pH the clusters of acidic residues may result in charge-charge repulsion and a more random conformation, whereas neutralization of the negative charges removes the local repulsion effects and allows helical structure. The pK a values of glutamate and aspartate suggest that lowering of the pH will result in protonation of the glutamate residues first. These acidic residues are mainly situated in the C-terminal part of the polypeptide (Fig. 8), so neutralization of these side chains may allow the helical conformation to be adopted. Several of the amyloidosis-associated mutations identified to date have had the effect of adding an extra positive charge to the sequence of the N-terminal fragment. However, because of the large number of charges in the sequence, the additional charge actually has a relatively small effect on the pI of the polypeptide (increasing from 4.35 to 4.45). The mutations at 26, 50, and 60 will result in the positioning of opposite charges separated by one residue. This may favor extended Î²-sheet structure. Many other amyloidogenic proteins have been shown to be affected by acidification, notably transthyretin and lysozyme. Dobson (12Dobson C.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 68: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and Kelly (34Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar) propose that the lysosomes may play a key role in initiation of fibrillogenesis, although the pH of the lysosome may not be as low as the pH used to initiate amyloidosis in vitro. An acidic environment may destabilize some protein structures and allow conformational switching or it may allow the population, even to a small extent, of a misfolded species that is aggregation prone. In the case of the apoA-I fragment, the very large number of charged residues in the N-terminal fragment that will be directly affected by pH changes are almost certainly influential in the initiation of conformational change. Our studies of the effect of acidification by fluorescence indicated that reducing the pH caused some conformational change, presumably collapse of the random coil structure. At the relatively low protein concentrations used for the fluorescence experiments, protein aggregation was not observed after the pH was reduced. However, monitoring of the acidification process by CD at higher protein concentrations indicated that aggregation succeeded conformational change. In this study we have identified environmental conditions that drive the conversion of the polypeptide 1â93 of human apolipoprotein A-I from random coil to a predominantly anti-parallel Î²-sheet fibrillar aggregate, passing through a helical conformation. We have shown that this polypeptide has chameleon properties (35Perutz M.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 773-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, random, helical, or Î²-sheet conformations can be stabilized, with a barrier to reciprocal conversion. Aqueous solutions at neutral pH favor the random coil structure, trifluoroethanol and phospholipids stabilize the helical conformation, and low pH conditions prime the self-aggregation into Î²-sheet structure. The persistence of a predominantly random coil structure in aqueous solution at neutral pH is unusual for a polypeptide as long as the apoA-I-(1â93) peptide but is not unique among fibrillogenic proteins. Synuclein, one of the human proteins able to create pathological fibrils in vivo, has been demonstrated to behave in a similar manner. Î±-Synuclein is unfolded in its native state (36Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar), but the presence of an organic solvent like hexafluoroisopropanol induces the acquisition of helical structure, and in this conformation the protein is very sensitive to the heat-induced aggregation (37Kim T.D. Paik S.R. Yang C.-H. Kim J. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2489-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Phospholipids have a similar effect on synuclein and apoA-I-(1â93); in fact both proteins undergo large conformational changes and an increase in and stabilization of helical structure in the presence of phospholipids (38Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that the most fibrillogenic portion of Î±-synuclein is the N-terminal polypeptide 1â87 (39Serpell L.C. Berriman J. Jakes R. Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4897-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar); however, despite the similar behavior, the level of sequence homology between Î±-synuclein and the apoA-I N terminus is not significant. A comparison that may be more significant though is the fact that both apoA-I-(1â93) and Î±-synuclein belong to the category of natively unfolded proteins (32Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). The experimental data presented here and previously performed NMR studies (23Mangione P. Sunde M. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Esposito G. Gianelli L. Obici L. Asti L. Andreola A. Viglino P. Merlini G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) are fully consistent with the prediction of apoA-I-(1â93) being a natively unfolded protein on the basis of the algorithm that considers the mean hydrophobicity and the mean net charge in aqueous solution at neutral pH (32Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 33Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). On the basis of these parameters full-length apoA-I in the lipid-free state also fulfils the criteria for the inclusion in this protein category. Conditions permissive for in vitrofibrillogenesis of lipid-free full-length apoA-I were discovered by Wisniewski et al. (25Wisniewski T. Golabek A.A. Kida E. Wisniewski K.E. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 238-244PubMed Google Scholar), but it is uncertain if this process is relevant to the deposition in vivo. Biomedical data so far available suggest that the cleavage of full-length apoA-I and the release of the N-terminal polypeptide could represent the regulatory step in the fibrillogenic pathway. The accuracy of the site of the proteolytic cleavage is apparently crucial for any further metabolic processing of apoA-I polypeptide. In fact, enhanced proteolytic susceptibility is described for apoA-I variants associated with metabolic abnormalities, but without amyloid disease. Of interest is the metabolic pathway of apoA-I Finland associated with hypoalphalipoproteinemia (40Mc Manus D.C. Scott B.R. Franklin V. Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21292-21302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this case the mutation (L159R) affects the protein secretion, reduces the half-life of circulating apoA-I, and has a dominant negative effect on wild type apoA-I, a behavior quite similar to that hypothesized for the apoA-I (L174S) variant (23Mangione P. Sunde M. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Esposito G. Gianelli L. Obici L. Asti L. Andreola A. Viglino P. Merlini G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the case of the apoA-I Finland mutation, a â18-kDa Nâterminal polypeptide (40Mc Manus D.C. Scott B.R. Franklin V. Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21292-21302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) is released in plasma and appears to prime a degradative, rather than a fibrillogenic, pathway. The tissue compartment where the putative primary proteolytic cleavages occur for both the wild type and amyloidogenic species awaits definition; at present, the chemical environment and the nature of the proteolytic enzyme(s) are largely unknown. We believe that new data in this area will complement the data we have presented on the folding dynamics of this apoA-I polypeptide and will allow the molecular mechanism underlying this disease to be elucidated. We are very grateful to Giuseppina Ferri and Piero Pucci for continuous advice and support. The assistance of Alberto Bovera is also acknowledged."

Although the cytotoxic T-lymphocytes response is major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted, this restriction does not apply to inhibition of HIV-1 replication by CAF (17Walker C.M.

Virol. 1991; 65: 5921-5927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the production of CAF appears to be the property of stimulated CD8+ T-cells and does not require HIV infection (19Le Borgne S. Fevrier M. Callebaut C. Lee S.P. Riviere Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4456-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Locher C.P. Blackbourn D.J. Levy J.A. Immunol.

One site of CAF action is the inhibition of HIV-1 RNA transcription, particularly at the long terminal repeat (LTR) that is assumed to function through down-regulation of the NF-ÎºB pathway (19Le Borgne S. Fevrier M. Callebaut C. Lee S.P. Riviere Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 4456-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,21Mackewicz C.E. Blackbourn D.J. Levy J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It seems probable that the antiviral action of CAF is achieved by more than one cytokine or chemokine secreted by CD8+T-cells, perhaps acting in concert (28Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Combadiere C.

In this study, we used a gene array to perform a more comprehensive analysis of gene expression by CD8+T-cells from HIV-infected persons.

We show that recombinant NKEF-A and NKEF-B protein exogenously added to HIV-1 cultures can inhibit HIV-1 replication and that T-cells transfected with NKEF-A or NKEF-B cDNA were resistant to HIV-1 infection. Plasma was obtained from 13 long term nonprogressors. Control plasma samples were obtained from 13 HIV-1 seronegative, healthy donors. Additional plasma samples from 6 asymptomatic, 5 symptomatic, and 2 AIDS patients, all under highly active antiviral therapy treatment for progressive disease, were investigated. Bulk CD8+ T-cells were purified, expanded, and stimulated as described previously (26Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) by anti-CD3 cross-linking from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which were obtained from six HIV-1-infected long term non-progessors (17393, 15188, CTS-02, NEW, RK2000, and CX741) (26Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and from seven HIV-1 seronegative individuals. Bulk CD8+ T-cells for each individual were treated separately. Long term non-progression was defined as being infected for more than 10 years, having plasma HIV-1 loads <400 RNA copies per ml, and CD4+ T-cell counts >500 per Î¼l in the absence of therapy. For the inhibition tests, HIV-1IIIB, a T-cell tropic strain of HIV-1 (ATCC CRL-8543) was used. H9 cells (HLA Al, B6, Bw62, and Cw3) were acutely infected with HIV-1IIIB at a multiplicity of infection of 10â2 TCID50/ml and resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 20% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma; R20 medium) (26Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were then plated in 2 ml of R20 medium at 5 Ã 105 cells/ml in a 24-well plate. H9 cell supernatant (1 ml) was removed every 3 days and replaced with 1 ml of fresh R20 medium supplemented with recombinant NKEF-A or NKEF-B protein. After 9 days the concentration of p24-antigen was measured using an HIV-1 p24 ELISA kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the dual-tropic SIV-239 or dual-tropic SHIVKU-1 studies, the human T-cell line 174xCEM was infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10â2 TCID50/ml and resuspended in R20. The cells were then plated as described above. After 9 days the concentration of SIV p27-antigen was measured by ELISA (Coulter, Miami, FL). The medium controls demonstrated p24 or p27 antigen levels in excess of 100 ng/ml at day 9 and were used to calculate percent virus inhibition. Jurkat cells were used for inhibition experiments following transfection with NKEF-A and NKEF-B. NKEF-A- and NKEF-B-pBacPAK9 vectors (38Shau H. Huang A.C. Faris M. Nazarian R. de Vellis J. Chen W.

The digest was treated with T4 polymerase (Invitrogen) for blunt-end ligation according to the manufacturer's instructions. The NKEF-A and NKEF-B fragments were then inserted into the SmaI cloning site of the pIRES2-EGFP expression vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and cultured inEscherichia coli. Plasmid DNAs were purified, and the direction of the inserts was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Jurkat cells were then transfected with a DNA/liposome mixture (FuGENE, Roche Diagnostics) and selected under G418 (Sigma) pressure (1.5 mg/ml). Stable transfected cells were then used in the above described inhibition test using 1.5 mg/ml G418. For days 1â9 the concentration of p24 antigen was measured using an HIV-1 p24 ELISA kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The percentage of inhibition was calculated against a control with the empty pIRES2-EGFP vector. For total RNA extraction cell pellets of 0 or 4 h, anti-CD3-activated bulk CD8+ T-cells (107) were lysed with 1 ml of RNA STAT60 (Tel-Test B, Friendswood, TX), and the cellular RNA was purified using the RNA STAT60 protocol. To eliminate the DNA contaminant of the RNA the CleanMessageTM Kit (Genhunter, Nashville, TN) was used. 10 Î¼g of total cellular RNA was fractionated on a 1.2% agarose, 0.7% formaldehyde gel and transferred to a GeneScreen membrane (DuPont). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-specific DNA probes (Clontech) and NKEF-A-specific DNA probes (33Shau H. Kim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were 32P-radiolabeled using the DECAprimeTM Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Membranes were sequentially hybridized with the 32P-radiolabeled cDNA probes. Blots were washed at high stringency (0.2Ã SSC, 55 Â°C) and were measured with Molecular PhosphorImager System GS-363 (Bio-Rad) for an equal amount of time. Signal intensity calculations were performed using the supporting software program Molecular AnalystTMand calculated against the GAPDH signal. The ATLAS ArrayTM(Clontech) is a nitrocellulose membrane with 588 spotted cDNAs. For the hybridization polyadenylated (poly(A)+) mRNA was prepared from 100 Î¼g of total RNA of 4 h CD3-cross-linked or untreated bulk CD8+T-cells. Bulk CD8+ T-cells for each individual were examined separately. The mRNA was suspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and separated on poly(A) QuikÂ® mRNA Columns (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 Î¼g (in 2 Î¼l) of each poly(A)+ mRNA sample was transcribed to radiolabeled cDNA using 1 Î¼l of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (50 units/ul; Stratagene) and 3.5 Î¼l [Î±-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) according to the ATLAS assay protocol and used for hybridization. The binding of radioactivity to membrane was measured with the Molecular PhosphorImager System GS-363 (Bio-Rad) for an equal amount of time. Signal intensity calculations were performed using the supporting software program Molecular AnalystTM and calculated against the GAPDH signal. To produce the NKEF-A and NKEF-B proteins for the above described inhibition test, the NKEF-A and NKEF-B genes were cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pBacPAK9 (Clontech) and overexpressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21 cells; Clontech) as described (33Shau H. Kim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). After transfections Sf21 cells were harvested and lysed with insect lysis buffer (Pharmingen) at days 2â4. Afterward recombinant protein was purified as described earlier (35Sauri H. Ashjian P.H. Kim A.T. Shau H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For the NKEF-A and NKEF-B ELISAs 2 Î¼g/ml of monoclonal mouse anti-NKEF-A or anti-NKEF-B antibody (Pharmingen) was incubated overnight at 4 Â°C on protein high-binding EIA/RIA plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in coating buffer (0.05 mCO32â/HCO3âbuffer, pH 9.6). Plates were washed with PBST buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma), pH 7.4) and blocked for 2 h at 37 Â°C with blocking buffer (PBS, 3% (v/v) goat serum, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). Plates were washed with PBST buffer. Standard protein or samples were incubated for 2 h at 37 Â°C. Plates were washed with PBST buffer. A rabbit polyclonal NKEF-A/NKEF-B detection antibody (32Shau H. Gupta R.K. Golub S.H. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 147: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which recognizes both forms of the NKEFs, was diluted 1:1000 in PBSBT buffer (PBS, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100) and was added at 37 Â°C for 30 min. After washing with PBST buffer a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (Vector, Burlingame, CA) was used at 1:50,000 dilution at room temperature for 20 min. After washing with PBST buffer the ELISA was developed for 30 min at room temperature with a 1:1 dilution of peroxidase solution B and TMB peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and stopped with 4 n H2SO4. SDS-PAGE and Western blot was carried out as described previously (26Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using polyclonal NKEF-A- and NKEF-B-specific antibodies (32Shau H. Gupta R.K. Golub S.H. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 147: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:10,000. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). Fisher's exact test was used to determine significance. Standard error is shown as error bars in the figures. CD8+T-cells are a major source for inhibitory non-cytolytic factors in HIV-1-infected persons. We have shown previously (26Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that secretion of soluble antiviral factors is elevated in expanded CD8+T-cells from HIV-infected persons. In order to assess potential differences in gene expression, which might also be responsible for the antiviral activity, we evaluated mRNA derived from CD8+T-cells using the ATLAS array, which contained 588 unique genes. Expanded CD8+ T-cell populations of HIV-1 seronegative and the HIV-1 seropositive untreated individuals were evaluated prior to stimulation and 4 h following stimulation with anti-CD3. Although the ATLAS array includes a wide spectrum of genes, significant differences were limited to the expression of only four genes. These included significant differences (p < 0.001) in mRNA levels for the chemokine I-309, the cytokines GM-CSF and IL-13, and the peroxiredoxin gene NKEF-B (Fig. 1 A). The peroxiredoxin data were confirmed by Northern blot analysis using NKEF-A cDNA, a homologue of NKEF-B, which showed differences for this peroxiredoxin gene as well (Fig. 1 B). Both proteins have antioxidant function, and a natural killer cell activity was found for the NKEF-A and NKEF-B complex or for recombinant NKEF-A (reviewed in Ref. 39Butterfield L.H. Merino A. Golub S.H. Shau H. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 1999; 1: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These mRNA results are consistent with previous studies showing higher secretion of I-309, GM-CSF, and IL-13 in stimulated CD8+ T-cells from seropositive persons (26Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and they extend these prior studies by demonstrating the elevation in these peroxiredoxin family mRNAs in CD8+ T-cells from HIV-1 seropositive persons. By having demonstrated that GM-CSF, I-309, IL-13, and the NKEFs were preferentially expressed in CD3-activated, HIV-1-infected but untreated individuals, we next evaluated whether some of these gene products might contribute antiviral activity. Although GM-CSF, I-309, and IL-13 have been shown to influence HIV-1 replication in somein vitro systems (40Crowe S.M. Lopez A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we found that these proteins did not inhibit HIV-1IIIB replication in acutely infected T-cells when added up to 1 Î¼g/ml, demonstrating that they do not contribute to the observed inhibition (see Ref. 26Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and data not shown). In contrast, we found that recombinant NKEF-A and NKEF-B proteins that we expressed in Sf21 cells using a baculovirus expression system and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2 A) inhibited HIV-1IIIB replication at an ID50 of 130 nm (3 Î¼g/ml), respectively (Fig. 2 B). Additionally, using the NKEF-B protein for the inhibition assay with dual-tropic SHIV and dual-tropic SIV strains, we found nearly complete suppression of these viruses at 3 Î¼g/ml (Fig. 2, C andD). Total protein lysate of untransfected Sf21 cells was used as a control and demonstrated no inhibition, excluding contaminating Sf21 protein as being responsible for inhibition (data not shown). The observed inhibition did not correlate with a decrease in cell count as measured at log phase of cell growth from day 2 to 6 by trypan blue staining (data not shown). Our data indicate that recombinant NKEFs can inhibit replication of X4 HIV-1, dual-tropic SIV, and dual-tropic SHIV. By having demonstrated that the NKEFs can inhibit HIV-1 replication, we next tested whether the NKEFs are secreted or released from stimulated CD8+ T-cells, and whether these proteins contribute to the antiviral activity of these cells (26Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although NKEF-A and NKEF-B proteins were originally described as endogenous proteins (33Shau H. Kim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 37Shau H. Kim A.T. Hedrick C.C. Lusis A.J. Tompkins C. Finney R. Leung D.W. Paglia D.E. Free Radic. Biol.

Neuropathol. 1998; 34: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), thioredoxin (also termed adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor), another protein that serves as the electron donor for most peroxiredoxins (reviewed in Ref. 42Perl A. Banki K. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 551-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), has been shown to be secreted through a novel pathway despite having no signal sequence (43Rubartelli A. Bajetto A. Allavena G. Wollman E. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24161-24164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar observation has been confirmed for peroxiredoxin IV (44Okado-Matsumoto A. Matsumoto A. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We found that both NKEF-A and NKEF-B proteins were secreted after 4 h, regardless of whether the cells were stimulated. The concentrations produced averaged 15â40 ng/ml (Fig. 3) or were at least 10â20 times higher than seen for the chemokines and cytokines at this 4-h time point (26Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and were up to â¼125 ng/ml at 16 h. The secretion was observed in stimulated CD8+ T-cells from both infected and uninfected individuals (Fig. 3). Thus, despite higher levels of NKEF mRNA in cells from seropositive persons, supernatants of activated CD8+ T-cells from both infected and uninfected individuals contained comparable amounts of these proteins, and this might be the result of the missing active protein secretion. This indicates that although NKEFs are able to exert antiviral activity, they are not the elusive CAF, which is produced in greater amounts from CD8+T-cells of infected persons (26Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Additionally, the concentrations of secreted NKEFs at 4 h (15â40 ng/ml) are at levels below those causing significant inhibition (Fig. 2) at a time when significant inhibition by HIV-1-suppressive factor(s) was observed (26Geiben-Lynn R. Kursar M. Brown N. Kerr E. Luster A. Walker B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8306-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By having demonstrated that the NKEFs are secreted, we next tested blood plasma levels by a specific ELISA to evaluate if plasma concentrations were sufficient to mediate inhibition of HIV-1 replication in vivo. Additionally, we tested if blood plasma levels are dependent on whether individuals are infected or not and treated or untreated. We could not detect a significant difference in NKEF-A or NKEF-B levels in plasma among the uninfected and the long term nonprogressor population. Nevertheless, plasma levels of the NKEFs were elevated (up to 500 ng/ml) in 3 of 13 (â¼23%) HIV-1-infected but untreated persons tested, with levels 2.5â8 times higher than the uninfected or treated HIV patients (Fig. 4). For HIV-1-infected but untreated persons NKEF-A and NKEF-B were found at levels up to 1 Î¼g/ml. At this concentration HIV-1 inhibition was detectable in vitro (Fig. 2 B), and an increase of natural killer cell activity in vitro has been noted (35Sauri H. Ashjian P.H. Kim A.T. Shau H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), demonstrating that NKEFs might have an antiviral influence in vivo. We demonstrated that blood plasma of long term non-progressors have significantly more NKEF-B compared with blood plasma of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (Fig. 4). Our data indicate that el"
https://openalex.org/W2138522837,"The mechanism by which genotoxic stress induces IRF-1 and the signalling components upstream of this anti-oncogenic transcription factor during the response to DNA damage are not known. We demonstrate that IRF-1 and the tumour suppressor protein p53 are coordinately up-regulated during the response to DNA damage in an ATM-dependent manner. Induction of IRF-1 protein by either ionizing radiation (IR) or etoposide occurs through a concerted mechanism involving increased IRF-1 expression/synthesis and an increase in the half-life of the IRF-1 protein. A striking defect in the induction of both IRF-1 mRNA and IRF-1 protein was observed in ATM deficient cells. Although ATM deficient cells failed to increase IRF-1 in response to genotoxic stress, the induction of IRF-1 in response to viral mimetics remained intact. Re-expression of the ATM kinase in AT cells restored the DNA damage inducibility of IRF-1, whilst the PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibited IRF-1 induction by DNA damage in ATM-positive cells. The data highlight a role for the ATM kinase in orchestrating the coordinated induction and transcriptional cooperation of IRF-1 and p53 to regulate p21 expression. Thus, IRF-1 is controlled by two distinct signalling pathways; a JAK/STAT-signalling pathway in viral infected cells and an ATM-signalling pathway in DNA damaged cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062671986,"The proglucagon gene encodes several peptide hormones that regulate blood glucose homeostasis, growth of the small intestine, and satiety. Among them, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) lowers blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes and inhibits eating and drinking in fasted rats. Although proglucagon transcription and GLP-1 synthesis were shown to be activated by forskolin and other protein kinase A (PKA) activators, deleting or mutating the cAMP-response element (CRE) only moderately attenuates the proglucagon gene promoter in response to PKA activation. Therefore, PKA may activate proglucagon transcription via a mechanism independent of the CRE motif. Recently, PKA was shown to phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3Î², a key mediator in the Wnt signaling pathway. We show here that lithium, an inhibitor of GSK-3Î², activates proglucagon gene transcription and stimulates GLP-1 synthesis in an intestinal endocrine L cell line, GLUTag. The activation was also observed in primary fetal rat intestinal cell (FRIC) cultures, but not in a pancreatic A cell line. Co-transfection of Î²-catenin, a downstream effector of GSK-3Î² activities, activated the proglucagon gene promoter without a CRE. Furthermore, forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP phosphorylated GSK-3Î² at serine 9 in intestinal proglucagon-producing cells, and both lithium and forskolin induced the accumulation of free Î²-catenin in these cell lines.

Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 876-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A single proglucagon mRNA transcript, derived from a common transcription start site, is identical in all the three tissues. Cell type-specific posttranslational processing, however, gives rise to a different profile of proglucagon-derived peptides in each tissue (1Kieffer T.J. Habener J.F. Endocr.

Glucagon is produced in the pancreatic A cells. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)1 and glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), however, are produced in the endocrine L cells and in selected endocrine neurons in the brain (1Kieffer T.J. Habener J.F. Endocr.

GLP-1 is known as an insulinotropic hormone. It possesses potent effects to stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion, insulin gene expression, and B cell cAMP formation. Other effects of GLP-1 include inhibition of glucagon release and gastric emptying and, possibly, enhancement of peripheral insulin sensitivity (1Kieffer T.J. Habener J.F. Endocr.

In addition, intracerebroventricular administration of GLP-1 was found to powerfully inhibit eating and drinking and alter body weight in fasted rats (3Turton M.D. O'Shea D. Gunn I. Beak S.A.

Furthermore, a recent study shows that peripheral GLP-1 also plays a role in regulating macronutrient selection and food intake (5Peters C.T. Choi Y.H. Brubaker P.L. Anderson G.H. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 2164-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GLP-2 was initially identified as a growth factor for the small intestine (6Drucker D.J. Erlich P. Asa S.L. Brubaker P.L. Proc.

Recent observations indicate that GLP-2 and its receptor also possess an overlapping function with GLP-1 in regulating gastric emptying and controlling satiety (7Lovshin J. Estall J. Yusta B.

Numerous studies conducted in the past 15 years have identified more than a dozen transcription factors and signaling molecules that play roles in driving proglucagon gene expression (9â31). However, none of the identified transcription factors or signaling molecules has been found to be tissue type- or cell type-specific. Protein kinase A (PKA) is able to stimulate proglucagon gene transcription and glucagon or GLP-1 synthesis in both primary and transformed intestinal endocrine cells as well as in rat primary pancreatic islet cultures (11Drucker D.J.

However, deleting or mutating the cAMP-response element (CRE) in the proglucagon gene promoter only partially attenuates its response to PKA activation in the small intestinal proglucagon-producing cell line STC-1 (13Gajic D.

This indicates that PKA may up-regulate proglucagon gene expression via a yet to be identified signaling pathway. Recently, PKA was found to phosphorylate and inactivate the serine/threonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3Î² (GSK-3Î²) in several cell lineages (32Fang X., Yu, S.X., Lu, Y. Bast R.C.

These observations prompted us to ask whether this newly identified function of PKA is engaged in proglucagon gene transcription. GSK-3Î² is a major mediator of the Wnt signaling pathway (34Kinzler K.W. Nilbert M.C., Su, L.K. Vogelstein B. Bryan T.M. Levy D.B. Smith K.J. Preisinger A.C. Hedge P. McKechnie D. Finnear R.

In normal epithelial cells, adenomatous polyposis coli together with GSK-3Î² and Axin bind to and phosphorylate Î²-catenin (Î²-cat), targeting Î²-cat for proteasomal mediated degradation. In embryonic cells, Wnt signals inactivate GSK-3Î², resulting in free Î²-cat accumulation. Free Î²-cat then forms a bipartite transcription factor with a T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF), namely cat/TCF, activating the Wnt responsive or cat/TCF target genes (36van Es J.H. Giles R.H. Clevers H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Another notable inhibitor of GSK-3Î² is lithium, which mimics the function of the Wnt signals in embryonic cells (37Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Biol.

In this study, using cultivated intestinal endocrine cell lines as well as primary intestinal cells in culture, we examined whether Wnt signaling pathway/molecules mediate the effect of PKA in activating proglucagon gene transcription and GLP-1 synthesis. Tissue culture medium and serum and oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen. Radioisotopes were obtained from Amersham Biosciences.

It contains a potential binding site (AAGTTTC) for the bipartite transcription factor cat/TCF (35He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

The intestinal GLUTag, STC-1, and the pancreatic InR1-G9 cell lines were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with appropriate serum (39Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of lithium and forskolin on proglucagon mRNA expression, GLP-1 synthesis, and secretion, cells were grown in the medium containing the appropriate serum overnight. 6 h prior to the experiment, serum-containing medium was withdrawn, and serum-free medium was added. For the LUC reporter gene analysis, the intestinal endocrine cell lines GLUTag and STC-1 were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions, whereas the InR1-G9 cell line was transfected by a method of calcium precipitation (42Xu F., Li, H.

Fetal rat intestinal cell (FRIC) cultures were prepared using 19â21 days-of-gestation fetal Wistar rats (Charles River Canada, Saint Constant, Quebec, Canada), as described in detail previously (11Drucker D.J.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2420-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In FRIC cultures, the endocrine L cells account for â¼1% of the cell numbers. The methods used for RNA extraction and Northern blot analysis were described previously (39Jin T. Drucker D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The anti Î²-catenin antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences, and the anti-phospho-GSK-3Î± and -3Î² antibodies were from New England Biolabs (32Fang X., Yu, S.X., Lu, Y. Bast R.C. Woodgett J.R.

(43Shimizu H. Julius M.A. Giarre M. Zheng Z. Brown A.M. Kitajewski J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 1349-1358PubMed Google Scholar). The methods used for immunoblotting and for examining the PKA phosphorylation of GSK-3 were described previously (32Fang X., Yu, S.X., Lu, Y. Bast R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2420-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), peptides from the media were extracted by adding 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid followed by passage twice through a cartridge of C18 silica (C18 SepPak, Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Peptides contained in the cells were extracted by homogenization in 1 n HCl containing 5% HCOOH, 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 1% NaCl, followed by passage through a C18 SepPak. An RIA for immunoreactive GLP-1 was carried out using an antiserum directed toward the C-terminal end of GLP-17â36NH2 (Affinity Research Products Ltd., Mamhead, UK), which has previously been demonstrated to detect predominantly GLP-17â36NH2 in GLUTag and FRIC cells (14Drucker D.J.

Endocrine. 1995; 3: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Lithium is a notable inhibitor of GSK-3Î². We hypothesized that if PKA activates proglucagon gene transcription via inactivating GSK-3Î², lithium may also activate proglucagon mRNA expression. We examined this hypothesis in the mouse large intestinal GLUTag (13Gajic D. Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 45Brubaker P.L. Schloos J.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1646-1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cell lines, as well as in the primary (FRIC) rat intestinal cultures. After incubation with 10 mmLiCl (48Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 4 h, both cell lines demonstrated â¼3-fold increased proglucagon mRNA expression (Fig. 1). In the GLUTag cells, the activation was still observable after 12 h (3.9-fold). After a 24-hour incubation in two experiments, we still observed an enhanced proglucagon mRNA expression. Results from one experiment are presented in Fig. 1 A. In two other experiments, however, proglucagon mRNA expression returned to untreated levels by 24 h (data not shown). In the STC-1 cell line, activated proglucagon gene expression was substantial during the whole experimental procedure (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1 A also shows that proglucagon mRNA expression in the GLUTag cells is activated by the PKA activators forskolin and IBMX as we demonstrated previously (14Drucker D.J. Jin T. Asa S. Young T. Brubaker P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1646-1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, an 8-h treatment of FRIC cultures with 10 mmLiCl enhanced proglucagon mRNA expression >3-fold (Fig. 1 C). The effect of lithium on proglucagon mRNA levels could be a result of enhanced transcription or reduced degradation or both. We therefore examined whether lithium activates the proglucagon gene promoter. Fig. 2 A shows that, after being transfected into the GLUTag cells, the expression of the â1.1-kb and the â472-bp promoter constructs was activated â¼5-fold by forskolin. The evolutionarily conserved CRE is located between â291 and â298 bp (9Philippe J. Drucker D.J Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). When the wild type â302-bp promoter was examined, â¼6-fold activation by forskolin was observed. However, even with the CRE-mutated [â302(M)] or deleted (â290) reporter gene constructs, forskolin still generated â¼3â3.5-fold activation. This is consistent with previous studies on the STC-1 cell line (13Gajic D. Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 17Lu F. Jin T. Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3710-3716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LiCl treatment also activated all the five promoter constructs examined by 2â3-fold, including those that carry a mutated [â302(M)] or deleted (â290) CRE. Lithium was also found to activate the proglucagon gene promoter constructs when transfected into the STC-1 cell line (Fig. 2 B). The stimulatory effect of LiCl on the proglucagon promoter was found to be dose-dependent (Fig. 2 B) and was observable within 4 to 12 h after the treatment (data not shown). To determine whether lithium also activates proglucagon gene expression in the pancreatic A cells, we conducted the above analyses against the hamster pancreatic A cell line InR1-G9. No appreciable activation on either proglucagon gene promoter or endogenous proglucagon mRNA expression was observed by LiCl treatment in this cell line (data not shown). We next examined the effect of lithium on GLP-1 synthesis and secretion in the GLUTag cell line and FRIC cultures. We demonstrated previously that GLP-1 synthesis and secretion in those cells could be activated by forskolin or other PKA activators (11Drucker D.J. Brubaker P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3953-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 14Drucker D.J. Jin T. Asa S. Young T. Brubaker P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1646-1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Huang T.H.J.

Incubating the GLUTag cells with 10 mm LiCl for 4 h did not affect either the synthesis or secretion of GLP-1 (data not shown). When the incubation time was extended to 8 h, a 1.7-fold increase in the GLP-1 content of cell was observed (p < 0.01, Fig. 3 A). In the same period, no change in GLP-1 secretion was observed as determined by an RIA of the cell free medium (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, FRIC cultures were treated without or with 10 mm LiCl or 10 mm KCl (as control) for 8 h or 24 h before the assessment of GLP-1 synthesis and secretion. Consistent with the stimulatory effect of LiCl on the GLUTag cells, LiCl also increased GLP-1 synthesis in FRIC cultures to 1.5-fold of the control (p < 0.05) after a 24 h incubation (Fig. 4). No substantial effects of LiCl on GLP-1 synthesis were observed at 8 h or on GLP-1 secretion at either 8 or 24 h (Fig. 4).Figure 4LiCl activates GLP-1 synthesis in FRIC cultures. FRIC cultures were treated with control medium alone or with 10 mm LiCl or KCl for 8 or 24 h. Cell and medium peptides were extracted and analyzed by RIA for immunoreactive GLP-1 levels.

Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If lithium indeed stimulates proglucagon transcription via inactivation of GSK-3Î², overexpressing Î²-cat should mimic the effect of lithium treatment. A reporter gene construct, namely TOPFLASH, has been widely utilized to examine the cat-TCF activity in colon cancer and other cell lines (41Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5010-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this plasmid, the expression of a LUC reporter gene is driven by a minimum TK promoter fused with three copies of the TCF binding site. As shown in Fig. 5, this fusion gene is dose dependently activated by LiCl but not by KCl when transfected into the GLUTag cells. We then directly examined the effect of the wild type and the constitutively active mutant Î²-cat, S33Y, on the expression of the proglucagon gene promoter. The S33Y mutant Î²-cat is resistant to degradation because it cannot be phosphorylated by GSK-3Î² (41Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3502) Google Scholar). Co-transfection with the wild type Î²-cat cDNA stimulated all of the proglucagon gene promoter constructs examined, except for the â1.1-kb promoter construct, by 1.7â2.0-fold (Fig. 6). Compared with the wild type Î²-cat, the S33Y mutant Î²-cat activated all five constructs more effectively, varying from 2.5- to 4-fold (Fig. 6). In addition, the S33Y mutant Î²-cat was able to activate the â1.1 kb proglucagon gene promoter construct. The activation was also independent of the CRE motif on the proglucagon gene promoter (Fig. 6). The consensus binding site for cat/TCF has been suggested to be WWGTTTC (35He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). We localized several potential cat/TCF binding sites on the proglucagon gene promoter. One such binding site is downstream of â290 bp and is a part of the G2 enhancer-like element (9Philippe J. Drucker D.J Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This site is conserved among the proglucagon genes of humans and rodents (9Philippe J. Drucker D.J Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Nian M. Drucker D.J. Irwin D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G829-G837PubMed Google Scholar). We inserted one copy of the G2 element in front of the TK promoter in the TK-LUC fusion gene plasmid, and the new fusion gene was named G2-TK-LUC (Fig. 7). LiCl was found to dose dependently activate G2-TK-LUC by up to 3-fold when transfected into the GLUTag (Fig. 7) and STC-1 (data not shown) cells. Furthermore, G2-TK-LUC was activated by forskolin by â¼5-fold (Fig. 7). Recent studies have shown that PKA phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3Î² in the HEK293 and NIH 3T3 cell lines (32Fang X., Yu, S.X., Lu, Y. Bast R.C. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11960-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In addition, PKA was also found to phosphorylate and inactivate GSK-3Î² in neuronal cells, and GSK-3Î² inactivation is linked to the inhibition of neuronal cell apoptosis (33Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). To further examine our hypothesis that Wnt pathway mediates the activation of proglucagon gene transcription by PKA, we examined GSK-3 phosphorylation and inactivation by PKA in the intestinal endocrine cell lines. As shown in Fig. 8, treating the GLUTag cells with forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP induced the phosphorylation of GSK-3Î± at serine 21 and GSK-3Î² at serine 9. In contrast, treating the GLUTag cells with 8-Br-cGMP did not change the phosphorylation status of GSK-3Î± or GSK-3Î² (Fig. 8). We then asked whether lithium treatment or PKA activation would lead to free Î²-cat accumulation in the two intestinal proglucagon-producing cell lines. The amount of Î²-cat in cell membrane and cell cytosol was examined by Western blot analysis following a cellular fractionation procedure (43Shimizu H. Julius M.A. Giarre M. Zheng Z. Brown A.M. Kitajewski J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 1349-1358PubMed Google Scholar). In four separate experiments we observed free Î²-cat accumulation in response to either LiCl or forskolin treatment, with activation levels varying from 2.5 to 10-fold. Data from one experiment are shown in Fig. 9. In this experiment, incubating the GLUTag cells with 10 mm LiCl for 2 h led to an â¼3-fold increase in cytosolic Î²-cat, whereas the change in Î²-cat in the membrane portion was minimal. Similarly, treating the GLUTag cells with forskolin for 2 h led to a 2.9-fold increase in cytosolic Î²-cat accumulation, whereas the change of Î²-cat in the membrane portion was minimal (Fig. 9 A). We also found that treatment of the GLUTag cells with 10 nm insulin for 12 h generated an appreciable effect on free Î²-cat accumulation (2.9-fold), whereas the effect at 2 or 4 h was minimal (Fig. 9 A). Similar results regarding free Î²-cat accumulation in response to these three reagents were obtained in examining the STC-1 cell line (Fig. 9 B). In mammals, a single proglucagon gene encodes three major peptide hormones expressed in three different tissues (1Kieffer T.J. Habener J.F. Endocr.

A systematic analysis of the regulatory cis-acting elements showed that in the presence of suboptimal splice sites or by deletion of exonic enhancer elements the promoter-dependent sensitivity to splicing factor-mediated inhibition was lost.

The phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD)1 of RNA polymerase II (pol II) provides key molecular contacts with these mRNA processing reactions throughout transcriptional elongation and termination. For example, transcripts originating from polymerases without a CTD (T7 polymerase and pol III) cannot be spliced or polyadenylated and, indeed, expression of a form of pol II lacking the CTD does not abrogate transcriptional activity but actually depresses pre-mRNA processing (4McCracken S.

The CTD can physically interact with several pre-mRNA processing factors (4McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 39935-39943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and with transcriptional factors that may have a dual role in transcription and splicing regulation. The connection between transcription and splicing might have important functional implications in vivo, because the promoter-dependent recruitment of regulatory splicing factor and/or changes in RNA pol II elongation and/or its phosphorylation state may influence the subsequent splice site selection (10Auboeuf D. Honig A. Berget S.M. O'Malley B.W. Science. 2002; 298: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). EDA transcript can be modified by changes in the promoter region of the gene, using a transient expression system combined with a promoter swapping processing of the alternative splicing fibronectin (11Cramer P. Pesce C.G. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11456-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It has been clearly shown that this effect is not because of the different mRNA levels produced by each promoter but is related to qualitative properties of the promoters. In addition, the sensitivity to overexpressed SR proteins, which induce EDA exon inclusion, depends on the promoter, thus suggesting that the promoter can modulate regulatory splicing factor action through the participation of the CTD (12Cramer P.

An alternative but not exclusive mechanism suggests that promoters may control alternative splicing via the regulation of pol II elongation or processivity (13Kadener S. Fededa J.P. Rosbash M.

In this case the splice site selection would be critically related to the timing of presentation of the splicing regulatory elements contained in the nascent transcripts. The differential behavior of the Î±-globin promoter compared with the FN promoter on EDA alternative splicing has recently been found to correlate with different transcriptional processivity (13Kadener S. Fededa J.P. Rosbash M. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8185-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The higher processive transcription elongation mediated by the Î±-globin promoter resulted in excess of the EDA exclusion, whereas the FN promoter gave the reverse effect. Alternative splicing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) exon 9, in contrast with fibronectin EDA, is inhibited by SR proteins, thus representing an interesting model for the study of the contribution of the promoter architecture on alternative splicing. The exon 9, at an early stage of synthesis of the CFTR transcript, emerges first from the elongating polymerase followed by the downstream intronic splicing silencer (ISS) element in intron 9. CFTR exon 9 recognition is modulated by exonic regulatory elements and splicing signals at the intron-exon boundaries. At the 3â²-end of intron 8 the presence of a variable number of dinucleotide TG (from 9 to 13) followed by a T repeat (T5, -7, or -9) generates polymorphic variants in the population. A high number of TG repeats and a low number of T tracts induces exon skipping (15Chillon M. Casals T. Mercier B. Bassas L. Lissens W. Silber S. Romey M.C. Ruiz-Romero J. Verlingue C. Claustres M.

Serine arginine-rich proteins (SR proteins) and, in particular the splicing factor 2 (SF2/ASF), interact with the ISS and negatively regulate CFTR exon 9 splicing (18Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar). In this study we have used the CFTR exon 9 and the FN EDB alternative splicing as models to further analyze the interplay between the promoter architecture and alternative splicing. FN EDB was considered because it shares similar but not identical structure with the previously studied FN EDA exon (11Cramer P. Pesce C.G. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11456-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the sensitivity of promoters to overexpressed SF2/ASF, the role of splice site strength, and the splicing regulatory elements in the mediation of the promoter effect on the alternative splicing. Our results indicate that the promoter has no effect on the FN EDB but can affect CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing. This CFTR exon 9-specific effect is mediated by the presence of the ISS silencer elements binding SR proteins. The exon recognition mediated by the splice sites and by the ESE modulates the promoter-dependent sensitivity to SF2/ASF, suggesting a kinetic role of transcription elongation in splicing. The 1508-bpPstI-PstI fragment of the Î±1-globin minigene in pBS KS containing the promoter region of the Î±1-globin along with the entire three exons of the gene was used for the preparation of the hybrid minigenes. The Î±1-globin minigene contains a uniqueBstEII site in the third exon that was used to clone the previously reported BstEII-BstEII cassette containing different versions of the CFTR exon 9 embedded in the fibronectin EDB genomic sequences (18Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar). The sequences of the fibronectin and CMV promoters used have been previously described; the mutant version of the fibronectin promoter contains disruptive point mutations at the â170 cAMP-response (CRE) and â150 CCAAT regulatory elements (11Cramer P.

The 900-bp SspI andHindIII fragments containing the FNWT, FNMut, and CMV promoters until the second exon of the Î±1-globin were obtained from the original pSVEDA plasmids (11Cramer P. Pesce C.G.

The promoter sequences of CF (1450 bp), of snRNA U2 (603 bp), and of H4 (865 bp) were amplified from genomic DNA, cloned in pBS KS, and entirely sequenced. The oligonucleotides used were: H4Dir, 5â²-gatctagagtacacgggaggatgtgca-3â²; H4Rev, 5â²-ctcacgcgtctctgccggacatgaccgctg-3â²; U2 Dir, 5â²-gatctagaccttcggcttccctgactgg-3â²; U2 Rev, 5â²-gtgatgcgcgcagatactacacttgatcttagc-3â²; CfproDir, 5â²-gagagctcgccttagatgtgtcggcaa-3â²; Cfprorev, 5â²-ctctacgcgtagctcggttggccacct-3â². The CF, U2, and H4 promoters were then digested withSacI/MluI, XbaI/BssHII, andXbaI/AflIII, respectively, and cloned in theBssHII site in the first exon of the Î±1-globin minigene, generating the CFÎ±, U2Î±, and H4Î± plasmids. Different variants of the CFTR exon 9 with different numbers of TGmTn repeats, with or without the ISS elements, with the G to A mutation at the 5â²-splice site or with the ESE deletion were obtained as aBstEII cassette from the previously described constructs (18Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar). The BstEII cassette was cloned in the uniqueBstEII site located in the third exon of the Î±1-globin of the FNWTÎ±, FNMutÎ±, CMVÎ±, CFÎ±, U2Î±, and H4Î± plasmids to generate the hybrid minigenes shown in Fig. 1. We transfected Hep3B cells with the DOTAP reagent with 3 Î¼g of each reported minigene and with the control empty vector pCG (0.5 Î¼g) (20Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) or with different amounts of the splicing factors SF2/ASF codifying plasmid. RNA extraction was performed after 48 h, and the RNA was digested with Dnase-Rnase free. RT-PCR was done as described (18Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar) with one of the two direct primers, Î±1, 5â²-cgcacgctggcgagtatggtg-3â² or Î±2, 5â²-caacttcaagctcctaagccactgc-3â², and with the reverse primer B2, 5â²-taggatccggtcaccaggaagttggttaaatca-3â². Amplified products were routinely loaded on 1.7% agarose-EtBr gels. For quantitation of the PCR reactions, [Î±-32]dCTP was included in the PCR reaction mixture, and the products were loaded on 6% native polyacrilamide gel, dried, and exposed to a Cyclone (PerkinElmer). The counts of each splicing band were corrected by the number of C/G present in the PCR product sequence. In dose-response experiments splicing inhibitions were calculated as percentages on the basis of the difference between the basal value corresponding to transfection with the control pCG plasmid and those obtained in the presence of different amounts of SF2/ASF. Differences in pol II promoter structure have been found to modify the processing of the fibronectin EDA alternative spliced transcript (11Cramer P. Pesce C.G. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11456-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 13Kadener S. Fededa J.P. Rosbash M. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8185-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To evaluate the specificity of this phenomenon we have analyzed the effect of several promoters on two alternative spliced exons, the FN EDB and the CFTR exon 9. The FN EDB exon is homologous to the EDA, is positively regulated by several SR proteins (21Du K. Peng Y. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Lim L.P. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Lim L.P. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3900-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Muro A.F. Caputi M. Pariyarath R. Pagani F. Buratti E. Baralle F.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2657-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CFTR exon 9 inclusion is modulated by multiple and well characterized exonic and intronic cis-acting elements (18Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar, 24Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) and is inhibited by SR proteins (18Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar, 25Nissim-Rafinia M. Chiba-Falek O. Sharon G. Boss A. Kerem B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1771-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). EDB and CFTR exon 9 hybrid minigene constructs were prepared with the transcription driven by Î±1-globin, FNWT, FNMut, CMV, and CF promoters (Fig. 1). These minigenes were transfected in Hep3B cells, and the pattern of splicing was analyzed by RT-PCR with the primers Î±2 and B2, which can detect the inclusion and exclusion of the corresponding alternative spliced exons. Transfection experiments with the CFTR exon 9 showed that the percentage of exon 9 inclusion was dependent on the promoter that drives transcription (Fig. 2 A). Inclusion of exon 9 in mature mRNA was predominant with the FNMut promoter (about 90% of exon 9 included) and poor with the Î±1-globin promoter (about 65% of exon 9 included), whereas intermediate splicing patterns were detected for the other constructs. On the contrary, transfection experiments with the FN EDB minigenes showed a percentage of EDB exon inclusion of about 10% that was not affected by the promoter driving the transcription (Fig. 2 B). These amplification experiments with the primers Î±2 and B2 were specifically aimed only at detection of the splicing of the alternative spliced exon. To determine whether the effect of the promoters is specific for the alternative spliced exon we analyzed full-length transcripts originating from the pre-mRNA splicing of the entire hybrid minigene. These transcripts, including the two constitutively spliced introns from the Î±1-globin gene, were detected with primers located in exon 1 and at the FN/exon 3 junction of the Î±1-globin gene. Fig. 2 C shows that the two full-length transcripts with or without the exons were correctly processed. Once again the percentage of exon 9 inclusion was differentially affected by the promoters, whereas no effect was evident for the EDB exon (data not shown). The different behaviors of the FN EDB and CFTR exon 9 indicate that specific exonic elements, and possibly context determinants, are important in mediating the effect of the promoter in the recognition of alternative spliced exons. Peculiar features of the alternatively spliced CFTR exon 9 may be involved in the promoter-dependent regulation. Previous studies have shown that some promoters are not competent regarding pre-mRNA processing. This occurs not only for bacterial T7 RNA polymerase but also for eukaryotic RNA pol IIII promoters. In addition, the expression of a form of pol II with truncation at the CTD strongly affects pre-mRNA processing (4McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). We have addressed the question of whether the promoters transcribing intronless genes can be considered functionally competent regarding splicing. If the promoter-mediated regulation of splicing is related to differential loading of splicing factors to the polymerase, we can suppose that there is no reason for intronless promoters to load such regulatory factors. Two pol II promoters that form intronless genes U2 and H4 were cloned in the CFTR exon 9 minigenes. Their effect on alternative splicing was analyzed with the primers located in exon 1 and at the FN/exon 3 junction of the Î±1-globin gene, which detect the entire length of the transcript. RT-PCR analysis showed that the U2 and H4 promoters have a normal capacity to splice introns from pre-mRNA transcripts (Fig. 3). The amount of transcript with the inclusion of the exon 9 was similar to the CF promoter. This data indicates that the promoters driving intronless genes contain all the elements required for intron processing. SR proteins can bind directly to specific RNA sequences and to other splicing factors. In addition they can associate, via the CTD, with the transcription machinery. These interactions could mediate promoter regulation of alternative splicing. In the case of the EDA exon, alternative splicing was shown to be critically dependent on the interaction of SF2/ASF with an ESE that induces exon inclusion (12Cramer P. Caceres J.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 251-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). With regard to the CFTR exon 9, SF2/ASF requires intact splicing silencer elements (ISS and ESS) to induce exon exclusion, the ISS being the main target of SR-protein interaction (18Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar). We have analyzed the promoter-mediated response to SF2/ASF in relation to changes at these splicing silencer elements. For this purpose three representative promoters (Î±-globin, CF, and FNMut) were selected and cloned upstream of two CFTR silencer variants, one consisting of deletion of the ISS element in intron 9 and the other represented by a single exonic nucleotide substitution (see Fig. 1 A). This latter adenine to cytosine substitution in position 146 of the exon (A146 â C) occurs in the previously reported ESS element (Ref. 18Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar and data not shown). The CFTR minigene constructs were cotransfected with the SF2/ASF plasmid and the resulting splicing pattern analyzed by RT-PCR amplification. Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 5shows that the deletion of both ISS and ESS together and of the ISS alone resulted in a practically complete exon 9 inclusion from mature mRNA, regardless of the promoter driving transcription. In the same CFTR silencer variants, no significant changes in the percentage of exon inclusion were observed after overexpression of SF2/ASF (Fig. 4,lanes 4 and 6). These results indicate that the promoter effect on CFTR exon 9 alternative splicing requires the interaction of SF2/ASF at the ISS element. We have analyzed the kinetics of the response to SF2/ASF in the CFTR exon 9 and in the EDB exon in order to investigate the role of SR proteins in relation to the promoter-mediated regulation of splicing. Constructs containing three representative promoters, Î±-globin, CF, and FNMut, driving transcription of either the CFTR exon 9 or EDB, were cotransfected with increasing amounts of the SF2/ASF plasmid and the resulting splicing pattern analyzed by RT-PCR amplification. In the CFTR exon 9, SF2/ASF induces exon skipping (18Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar). However, the dose-response curves obtained with an increased amount of SF2/ASF showed that the splicing inhibition was strictly dependent on the promoter driving transcription (Fig. 5 A). Each promoter showed a characteristic dose-response curve. The strongest response was observed for the Î±-globin promoter, whereas the FNMut showed a small inhibitory effect mediated by the SR protein. The CF promoter showed an intermediate splicing inhibition. In addition, we have also analyzed the response of the two intronless promoters, U2 and H4. These two promoters responded equally well to the SF2/ASF-mediated inhibition, further indicating the fully competent capacity of these promoters in splicing processivity (data not shown). On the other hand, cotransfection of the EDB minigene constructs with SF2/ASF showed an increase in the EDB+ variant as previously reported (21Du K. Peng Y. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4096-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Lim L.P. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3900-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). However, and in contrast with the CFTR exon 9 system, quantitative analysis of the percentage of the EDB inclusion induced by the splicing factors indicates that the magnitude of the response to SF2/ASF was independent from the promoter driving transcription (Fig. 5 B). To exclude the possibility that the ISE element in the EDB intron +1 (which is absent in the CFTR exon 9 minigenes) could be responsible for the promoter-dependent regulation of CFTR exon 9, we have analyzed EDB minigenes without thiscis-acting element. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the deletion of the ISE element did not affect sensitivity to the splicing factor, thus indicating that the ISE element is not responsible for the different promoter-mediated processing of the CFTR exon 9 splicing. Altogether, these results point to an important role exerted by multiple cis-acting elements located in the CFTR exon 9 and in the nearby flanking introns in mediating the promoter-specific effect on alternative splicing. The promoter architecture may differentially modulate the pol II processivity, which may as a result affect the interactions between the ISS and the SR proteins. The first element found by the elongating polymerase is the exon 9, which is followed by the ISS in intron 9. To modulate the recognition of CFTR exon 9 we have prepared minigene constructs with nucleotide substitutions at the splice sites or with the ESE deleted. We have previously shown that variations at or near the splice sites increase the proportion of CFTR transcripts without exon 9. This occurs by increasing the number of TG tracts or by reducing the T repeats at the 3â²-end of intron 8 or with an G to A mutation at the 5â²-splice site that introduces the use of a weak cryptic splice site in the exon (26Niksic M. Romano M. Buratti E. Pagani F. Baralle F.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recognition of exon 9 was reduced in the TG13-T3 variant, in the G â A mutation at the 5â²-SS, and in the ESE deletion and was increased in the T7 variant. Minigene constructs with three promoters (Î±-globin, CF, and FNMut) were cotransfected alone or with increasing amounts of the SF2/ASF coding plasmid to analyze the basal effect of the promoter and its specific sensitivity to the splicing factor, respectively. In the absence of SF2/ASF, the percentage of inclusion of exon 9 in mature mRNA was higher for the FNMut promoter, intermediate for the CF, and poor for the Î±1-globin promoter (Fig. 6). This pattern was independent from the variations introduced at the splice sites or at the ESE, indicating that the basal differences of the promoter are independent from the exon definition. On the contrary, the dose-response study to cotransfected SF2/ASF showed a different sensitivity according not only to the promoter but also to the changes in exon recognition. In contrast to the TG11T5 minigenes analyzed in Fig. 5, the sensitivity to SF2/ASF for the two splice sites variants and for the ESE deletion was not differentially affected by the promoters (Fig. 7, AâC). In these cases the minigenes responded with similar dose-response curves to the increasing amount of the splicing factors, indicating that in the presence of weak splice sites or when the ESE is deleted the promoter-mediated sensitivity to the splicing factor SF2/ASF is lost. On the contrary, a change in the length on the polymorphic polypyrimidinic tract from T5 to T7 gave a different sensitivity to SF2/ASF, according to the promoters (Fig. 7 D). These results indicate that exon definition does not affect the basal promoter-specific alternative splicing pattern but the specific sensitivity of the promoter to SF2/ASF.Figure 7Dose-response curves of exon 9 splicing induced by SF2/ASF as a function of the promoter and splice site variations and ESS deletion. Hybrid minigenes transcribed with different promoters containing mutation at the 5â²-splice site (5â²-SS G â A, panel A) or variations at the TGmTn repeats (GT13T3 andGT11T7, panel B and D, respectively) or deletion of the ESE (ÎESE, panel C) were transfected in Hep3B cells with the control plasmid pCG (500 ng) or with increasing amounts of SF2/ASF coding plasmid (50, 100, 250, and 500 ng, respectively). The splicing pattern was then analyzed by RT-PCR with Î±2 and B2 primers and resolved on 1.7% agarose gels. The percentage of exon 9 inclusion, shown at the bottom of each lane, is the mean of three independent experiments and was calculated as indicated in the legend of Fig 5. The dose-response curves at theright of each panel show the corresponding splicing inhibition induced by SF2/ASF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study we have analyzed the role of the promoter architecture on the regulation of alternative splicing of two exons, the fibronectin EDB and the CFTR exon 9. We show that the promoter structure can modify the splicing pattern of the CFTR exon 9 but not that of the EDB exon. The âstructural unitâ of the CFTR responsible for this selective promoter effect includes not only the exon 9 itself, together with its regulatory elements, but also the flanking introns. The CFTR exon 9 represents a particular case of non-evolutionary conserved alternative splicing where the recognition of the exon is weakened by the SF2/ASF interaction at the downstream intronic ISS element (18Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar). In the first instance, we have analyzed the effect of disrupting the ISS element under several promoter contexts with or without overexpression of SF2/ASF. Mutation of the ISS abolished the splicing inhibition induced by SF2/ASF regardless of the kind of promoter (Fig. 4). This indicates that an intact ISS is necessary for the promoter modulation. We subsequently analyzed the sensitivity to SF2/ASF in the presence of an intact ISS element in relation to the promoter and to the composition of the exonic regulatory elements. Our results show that sensitivity to overexpressed SF2/ASF on the splicing pattern varies with the promoter structure. The highest splicing inhibition was observed for the Î±-globin promoter and the lowest for the fibronectin promoter. This promoter-dependent sensitivity to SF2/ASF depends, however, on the strength of the splice sites and on the presence of an intact ESE, two critical cis-acting elements involved in exon definition. According to the exon definition model, pairing between the splice sites across an exon, facilitated by the presence of exonic enhancer elements, forms the basic unit of initial recognition by the splicing machinery (27Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). This model may be particularly important in those genes with large introns. In the presence of weak splice sites or in the case of the deletion of the ESE, the promoters did not differentially affect sensitivity to the splicing factor (Fig. 7, AâC). This strongly suggests that the effect of the promoter on the CFTR exon 9 splicing depends both on the definition of the exon and on the presence of an intact ISS element. In addition, the promoters maintain a different splicing pattern on the basal level of CFTR inclusion in all the different variants affecting the exon definition (Fig. 6). Our results provide additional evidence to clarify the mechanisms that could be involved in the coupling of transcription and alternative splicing. Previous studies originally suggested that the promoter can modulate alternative splicing by differentially recruiting splicing factors to an exonic enhancer element (11Cramer P. Pesce C.G. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11456-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12Cramer P. Caceres J.F. Cazalla D. Kadener S. Muro A.F. Baralle F.E. Kornblihtt A.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 251-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In fact, in the EDA exon sensitivity to the cotransfected SR proteins was critically dependent on the promoter driving transcription; the Î±-globin promoter did not respond to SF2/ASF and the FN promoter responded, strongly inducing exon inclusion. However, in the CFTR exon 9 the Î±-globin promoter showed a higher sensitivity to SF2/ASF than the FN promoter. This indicates that the promoter itself is not responsible for recruiting splicing factors to the site of transcription and cannot mediate a different loading capacity of SR proteins to criticalcis-acting elements (Fig. 5). This is also consistent with the efficient splicing processivity of promoters from intronless U2 and H4 genes (Fig. 3). Our results reinforce an alternative mechanism of splice site selection mediated by the promoter that takes into account the different timing of presentation of the critical regulatory elements to the elongating polymerase. Experiments in which RNA pol II pause sites affect alternative splicing have suggested a kinetic link between transcription and splicing. This has been shown by delaying the transcription of an essential splicing inhibitory element required for regulation of tropomyosin exon 3 (28Roberts G.C. Gooding C. Mak H.Y. Proudfoot N.J. Smith C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). At the early stages of the synthesis of the CFTR transcript, the exon 9 emerges first from the elongating pol II followed by the downstream ISS. Therefore the alternative splicing decision will involve an initial definition of the CFTR exon 9 by splice sites and ESE recognition followed by subsequent silencing mediated by the intronic ISS. Its role could be imagined as that of a âdecoy exonâ presenting strong binding sites for the SR protein SF2/ASF. A highly processive polymerase would favor the simultaneous presentation of the exon 9 and the ISS, resulting in exon exclusion. If the pol II elongation is slower, the assembly of exon 9 spliceosomal complex will be favored because it does not have to compete with the ISS complex that will be later transcribed. In addition, the promoter influences the sensitivity to cotransfected SF2/ASF only when the emerging exon is better defined (Fig. 7 D). All this is consistent with the fact reported earlier that the Î±-globin promoter has a higher processivity than the FN promoter and that this promoter causes EDA exon exclusion (13Kadener S. Fededa J.P. Rosbash M. Kornblihtt A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8185-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 29Nogues G. Kadener S. Cramer P. Bentley D. Kornblihtt A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43110-43114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the EDA, the sensitivity to SF2/ASF in the CFTR exon 9 is higher than that of the promoter with a higher pol II processivity, i.e. the Î±-globin. This difference can be explained by the different targeting of the splicing factor. In fact, in the EDA SF2/ASF directly participates in the exon definition targeting in the exon itself. On the contrary, in CFTR exon 9 this splicing factor, interacting with the ISS element located in the downstream intron, causes exon skipping. In this dynamic and cotranscriptionally splicing decision a higher processivity of the pol II determined by the promoter is associated with a higher sensitivity to SF2/SF2 in the CFTR exon 9 because of the downstream location of the ISS. Mutations reducing the exon definition of CFTR exon 9 (such as the T5 allele at the end of intron 8) are frequently found in patients with monosymptomatic forms of cystic fibrosis (16Cuppens H. Lin W. Jaspers M. Costes B. Teng H. Vankeerberghen A. Jorissen M. Droogmans G. Reynaert I. Goossens M. Nilius B. Cassiman J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The resulting pathological aberrant exon skipping presents tissue-specific and individual phenotypic variability. It has been previously suggested that this variability results from the differential abundance of cell-specific trans-acting factors (18Pagani F. Buratti E. Stuani C. Romano M. Zuccato E. Niksic M. Giglio L. Faraguna D. Baralle F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 13: 13Google Scholar, 24Buratti E. Dork T. Zuccato E. Pagani F. Romano M. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1774-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The discovery of the promoter modulation of alternative splicing suggests that factors regulating splicing could be acting through promoters and influence not only physiological alternative splicing but also pathological splicing, thus explaining the phenotypic variability frequently found in splicing pathology. It is expected that the differential use of transcriptional factors at the promoter affecting the pol II processivity might result in variable expression of the pathological splicing processes.

https://openalex.org/W2045353567,"Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) is a metzincin superfamily metalloproteinase responsible for cleavage of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-4, thus causing release of bound insulin-like growth factor. PAPP-A is secreted as a dimer of 400 kDa but circulates in pregnancy as a disulfide-bound 500-kDa 2:2 complex with the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (pro-MBP), recently shown to function as a proteinase inhibitor of PAPP-A. Except for PAPP-A2, PAPP-A does not share global similarity with other proteins. Three lin-notch (LNR or LIN-12) modules and five complement control protein modules (also known as SCR modules) have been identified in PAPP-A by sequence similarity with other proteins, but no data are available that allow unambiguous prediction of disulfide bonds of these modules. To establish the connectivities of cysteine residues of the PAPP-AÂ·pro-MBP complex, biochemical analyses of peptides derived from purified protein were performed. The PAPP-A subunit contains a total of 82 cysteine residues, of which 81 have been accounted for. The pro-MBP subunit contains 12 cysteine residues, of which 10 have been accounted for. Within the 2:2 complex, PAPP-A is dimerized by a single disulfide bond; pro-MBP is dimerized by two disulfides, and each PAPP-A subunit is connected to a pro-MBP subunit by two disulfide bonds. All other disulfides are intrachain bridges. We also show that of 13 potential sites for N-linked carbohydrate substitution of the PAPP-A subunit, 11 are occupied. The large number of disulfide bonds of the PAPP-AÂ·pro-MBP complex imposes many restraints on polypeptide folding, and knowledge of the disulfide pattern of PAPP-A will facilitate structural studies based on recombinant expression of individual, putative PAPP-A domains. Furthermore, it will allow rational experimental design of functional studies aimed at understanding the formation of the PAPP-AÂ·pro-MBP complex, as well as the inhibitory mechanism of pro-MBP."
https://openalex.org/W1974356074,"In Î±T3-1 mouse anterior pituitary gonadotropes, chronic activation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors causes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor down-regulation (Willars, G. B., Royall, J. E., Nahorski, S. R., El-Gehani, F., Everest, H. and McArdle, C. A. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 3123â3129). In the current study, we sought to define the mechanism behind this adaptive response. We show that GnRH induces a rapid and dramatic increase in InsP3 receptor polyubiquitination and that proteasome inhibitors block InsP3 receptor down-regulation and cause the accumulation of polyubiquitinated receptors. Thus, the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is active in Î±T3-1 cells, and GnRH regulates the levels of InsP3 receptors via this mechanism. Given these findings and further characterization of this system, we also examined the possibility that Î±T3-1 cells could be used to examine the ubiquitination of exogenous InsP3 receptors introduced by cDNA transfection. This was found to be the case, since exogenous wild-type InsP3 receptors, but not binding-defective mutant receptors, were polyubiquitinated in a GnRH-dependent manner, and agents that inhibited the polyubiquitination of endogenous receptors also inhibited the polyubiquitination of exogenous receptors. Further, we used this system to determine whether phosphorylation was involved in triggering InsP3 receptor polyubiquitination. This was not the case, since mutation of serine residues 1588 and 1755 (the predominant phosphorylation sites in the type I receptor) did not inhibit polyubiquitination. In total, these data show that the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is active in anterior pituitary cells, that this pathway targets both endogenous and exogenous InsP3 receptors in GnRH-stimulated Î±T3-1 cells, and that, in contrast to the situation for many other substrates, phosphorylation does not trigger InsP3 receptor polyubiquitination. In Î±T3-1 mouse anterior pituitary gonadotropes, chronic activation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors causes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor down-regulation (Willars, G.

InsP3 receptors are a family of three proteins (termed type I, II, and III receptors) that form tetrameric ion channels in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and upon binding of InsP3, the channels open, and Ca2+ stored within the ER flows into the cytoplasm (6Patel S.

The event that initiates receptor proteolysis appears to be InsP3 binding, since only those GPCRs (e.g.GnRH, cholecystokinin, and muscarinic receptors) that persistently elevate InsP3 levels cause InsP3 receptor down-regulation (5Willars G.B.

Whether additional events (e.g. receptor phosphorylation) are required to trigger down-regulation remains to be resolved. Furthermore, it is not yet clear how InsP3 receptors are degraded, and indeed, receptor proteolysis by calpain (12Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Oberdorf J.A. J. Biol.

In characterizing this adaptive response, we identified major differences in the properties of commonly used proteasome inhibitors and found that deubiquitination of InsP3 receptors occurs rapidly and is likely to limit the accumulation of ubiquitinated receptors and that InsP3receptor ubiquitination is Zn2+-dependent. Importantly, we also used Î±T3-1 cells to develop conditions for the analysis of exogenous InsP3 receptor ubiquitination, and by expressing mutant receptors, we show that InsP3 binding is important in triggering this event but that phosphorylation is not.DISCUSSIONIn summary, the data presented show that GnRH-induced InsP3 receptor down-regulation in Î±T3-1 cells is mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, that transiently expressed exogenous InsP3 receptors are polyubiquitinated similarly to endogenous receptors, and that InsP3 binding, but not PKA-mediated InsP3 receptor phosphorylation, is a key event in the process that leads to polyubiquitination. In addition, we demonstrate that deubiquitination limits the accumulation of polyubiquitinated InsP3 receptors and that both thapsigargin and TPEN inhibit polyubiquitination.Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in anterior pituitary cells and the first demonstration that a hypothalamic releasing factor, such as GnRH, can utilize this pathway to regulate protein levels. Indeed, ubiquitin/proteasome pathway-mediated InsP3 receptor down-regulation is likely to contribute to the mechanism by which long term administration of GnRH and its analogues to patients suppresses luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone secretion and produces a hypogonadal state (2McArdle C.A. Franklin J. Green L. Hislop J.N. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 173: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 3Barbieri R.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 3: 30-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Further, these data raise the possibility that other proteins, perhaps those involved signal transduction (26Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.H. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar,40Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35238-35244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), might also be targeted by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in anterior pituitary cells upon GPCR activation.These studies also show that it is the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, and not other candidate proteolytic systems (12Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Oberdorf J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16652-16655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Hirota J. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34433-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), that accounts for GnRH-mediated InsP3 receptor down-regulation. Thus, in response to GnRH receptor activation, InsP3 receptors are targeted by members of the E2/E3 enzyme family that conjugate ubiquitin to proteins (27Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar, 28Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). In analyzing this response in Î±T3-1 cells, we have extended our understanding of InsP3 receptor polyubiquitination and the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in general in several ways. First, our data show that the accumulation of polyubiquitinated InsP3 receptors in the presence of proteasome inhibitors is countered by deubiquitination. Currently, virtually all work on deubiquitination has been done on purified proteins or disrupted cells (27Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar, 42Rajapurohitam V. Bedard N. Wing S.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E739-E745Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and very little is known about the role of this activity in intact cells, apart from a recent study showing that a novel enzyme specifically deubiquitinates and stabilizes p53 (43Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Whereas the nature of the activity that deubiquitinates InsP3 receptors in intact cells was not examined, its existence explains why the accumulation of polyubiquitinated species in proteasome inhibitor-treated cells is relatively minor, amounting to only 9 Â± 1% of the total receptor complement. It also suggests that in cells not exposed to proteasome inhibitors, polyubiquitinated InsP3 receptors will be subject to the competing effects of deubiquitinating enzymes (causing stabilization) and the proteasome (causing degradation). These and other findings (43Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that this situation is the norm for all polyubiquitinated proteins. Second, with regard to the mechanism of ubiquitination, the ability of TPEN to inhibit InsP3 receptor polyubiquitination implicates a RING domain-containing E3 in this process, perhaps one of the recently identified E3s involved in the degradation of ER proteins (36Gardner R.G. Shearer A.G. Hampton R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 44Fang S. Ferrone M. Yang C. Jensen J.P. Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14422-14427Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Mechanistic insight was also obtained using thapsigargin, which depletes ER Ca2+ (29Paschen W. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,30Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and completely inhibited InsP3 receptor polyubiquitination. This indicates that intraluminal Ca2+plays a role in InsP3 receptor polyubiquitination. Intriguingly, ubiquitin/proteasome pathway-mediated processing of other ER proteins is also inhibited by depletion of ER Ca2+ (45Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9080-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,46Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Thus, InsP3 receptor polyubiquitination appears to be via a pathway common to all ER proteins targeted via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway that is dependent on the normal storage of Ca2+ in the ER and perhaps on Ca2+ binding to one or more of the many Ca2+-binding ER proteins (29Paschen W. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 30Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 31Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30293-30300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Finally, comparison of the effects of different proteasome inhibitors showed that they varied considerably in their rate of action, with ALLN and MG-132 acting much more rapidly than lactacystin and epoxomicin. This kinetic variation most likely reflects the mechanistic differences between the inhibitors (23Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 24Meng L. Mohan R. Kwok B.H.B. Elofsson M. Sin N. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10403-10408Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) and clearly should be taken into account when these inhibitors are used.We have also been able to show that exogenous transiently expressed receptors are polyubiquitinated in response to GPCR activation. This is significant, because in order to study the triggering and site specificity of polyubiquitination, it will be necessary to assess a large number of mutant receptors, which can be most easily accomplished by expressing them transiently. In summary, we found that exogenous InsP3RHAwt was processed in response to GnRH receptor activation similarly to endogenous InsP3 receptor but with the exception that it was also constitutively âmonoubiquitinatedâ (modified with one or a very small number of Myc-ubiquitin residues). Significantly, whereas InsP3RHAwt was both poly- and monoubiquitinated, InsP3RHAÎ, which does not bind InsP3 (17Zhu C.C. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3476-3484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), was only monoubiquitinated, indicating that only polyubiquitination occurs in response to InsP3binding. Furthermore, InsP3RHAwtpolyubiquitination, but not monoubiquitination, was blocked by thapsigargin and antide. Thus, monoubiquitination appears to be a process mechanistically discrete from that which mediates polyubiquitination and may be a response to the overexpression of exogenous receptors, a view supported by the observation that the prominence of monoubiquitination increased as exogenous receptor expression increased. Thus, it is possible that the capacity of Î±T3-1 cells to accommodate and correctly process transiently expressed exogenous InsP3 receptors is relatively limited, and above that capacity, the receptors are monoubiquitinated. The fact that exogenous receptors did not associate to a detectable extent with endogenous receptors lends credence to this view. An alternative explanation is that InsP3 receptor monoubiquitination is a normal cellular event that has been revealed because of the high sensitivity of the Myc epitope antibody. In this regard, it has recently been shown that other receptors and their associated proteins can be monoubiquitinated (40Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 48Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capura M.R. Bossi G. Chen H., De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) as a prelude to their trafficking to lysosomes. It is an intriguing possibility that InsP3receptors could be similarly processed.With regard to events that trigger type I InsP3 receptor polyubiquitination, the analysis of InsP3RHAÎshows that InsP3 binding, and presumably the conformational changes that result from this binding (49Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), cause the receptor to become polyubiquitinated. The possibility that phosphorylation might be involved in triggering polyubiquitination was also examined, since the type I InsP3 receptor is phosphorylated stoichiometrically in response to PKA activation in intact cells (6Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 7Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A.

Luo S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5670-5677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor was clearly not required for polyubiquitination, since InsP3RHAA/A was polyubiquitinated equivalently to InsP3RHAwt.In conclusion, our studies show that the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is active in Î±T3-1 anterior pituitary cells and mediates InsP3 receptor degradation in response to activation of GnRH receptors. Since transiently expressed exogenous receptors are polyubiquitinated similarly to endogenous receptors, use of this cell type will allow for the analysis of a range of mutant receptors and the dissection of the molecular events that lead to InsP3receptor polyubiquitination. Hormone-induced secretion from anterior pituitary cells is modulated at many different levels, and among these is regulation of the activity and abundance of receptors involved in signal transduction (1Shacham S.

Hislop J.N. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 173: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies on the Î±T3-1 mouse gonadotrope cell line have indicated that the suppression of secretion from gonadotropes in patients treated chronically with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)1 receptor agonists (2McArdle C.A.

InsP3 receptors are a family of three proteins (termed type I, II, and III receptors) that form tetrameric ion channels in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and upon binding of InsP3, the channels open, and Ca2+ stored within the ER flows into the cytoplasm (6Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 7Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A.

Thus, InsP3receptors play a pivotal role in linking G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated InsP3 formation to increases in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration (9Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4372) Google Scholar). A reduction in their expression (i.e. their down-regulation) would, therefore, be expected to suppress Ca2+ mobilization (4McArdle C.A. Willars G.B. Fowkes R.C. Nahorski S.R. Davidson J.S.

[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid single wavelength anomalous diffraction Heroin (3,6-diacetylmorphine) is a highly addictive, synthetic derivative of the alkaloid morphine (Fig. 1 A). The instability of the 3-acetyl suggests that it can undergo rapid spontaneous hydrolysis to give 6-acetylmorphine. HerE is known to hydrolyze the 6-acetyl of 6-acetylmorphine to yield morphine (k cat = 12.6 Â± 0.6 sâ1,K m = 0.5 Â± 0.06 mm) and was originally identified from the Rhodococcus sp. strain H1 by selective growth using heroin as the sole carbon source (1Cameron G.W. Jordan K.N. Holt P-J. Baker P.B. Lowe C.R. Bruce N.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3881-3883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of this esterase has facilitated development of a coupled enzyme biosensor for heroin detection (Fig. 1 A) with higher sensitivity than other currently available technology (2Holt P.J. Bruce N.C. Lowe C.R. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1877-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, hydrolysis of heroin by HerE generates morphine, which is the substrate for NADPH-dependent morphine dehydrogenase. The activity of morphine dehydrogenase is directly monitored by bacterial luciferase, which outputs a bioluminescent signal at 490 nm (Fig. 1 A) (2Holt P.J. Bruce N.C. Lowe C.R. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1877-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The higher activity (kcat K mâ1) of HerE toward smaller substrates such as phenyl acetate (Fig. 1 B) (k cat = 3.0 Â± 0.05 sâ1, K m = 70 Â± 8 nm at pH = 6.4) provides a benchmark for engineering the esterase binding pocket to accept bulkier substrates more efficiently. Hence, the crystal structure of this acetyl esterase should provide substantial insights for structure-based design of second generation heroin biosensors with improved sensitivity. In addition, our structure with the inhibitor dimethylarsinic acid (Fig. 1 B) demonstrates for the first time the covalent modification of serine by arsenic. Arsenic lies directly below phosphorous in the periodic table and shares some similar properties, but in general, arsenic is more reactive. As(V)-containing organic compounds comprise a known class of broad scope serine esterase/protease inhibitors (3Freedman L.D. Doak G.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 6374-6376Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 4Glazer A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Usually, arsonic R-As(V)O3H2 and arsinic R2-As(V)O2H compounds haveK i values in the Î¼m-mmrange (3Freedman L.D. Doak G.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955; 77: 6374-6376Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 4Glazer A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but surprisingly, the mechanistic basis for inhibition of esterase/proteases by As(V) compounds has never been defined from a crystal structure. The HerE esterase is the ideal model system for studying inhibition by dimethylarsinic acid, since the methyl groups correspond to the acetyl moiety that is hydrolyzed from heroin and phenyl acetate (Fig. 1 C). The most common form of inorganic arsenic is As(V)O43â (arsenate), which is reduced by As(V) reductases in vivo to As(III)O33â (arsenite). Interestingly, arsenite is further metabolized to several methylated species, CH3As(V)O32â, CH3As(III)O22â, (CH3)2As(V)O2â(cacodylate or dimethylarsinic acid), and (CH3)2As(III)Oâ, which are less cytotoxic than the inorganic form but may have a longer term carcinogenic impact in chronic exposure (5Thomas D.J. Styblo M. Lin S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2001; 176: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). These As(III) arsenicals are generally regarded as the more reactive and most toxic species (5Thomas D.J. Styblo M. Lin S. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2001; 176: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), and crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank confirm that As(III) compounds form covalent adducts with cysteine (6Maignan S. Guilloteau J.P. Zhou-Liu Q. Clement-Mella C. Mikol V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Our HerE crystal structure now demonstrates that dimethylarsinic acid, one of the key metabolites associated with chronic arsenic toxicity, could also form a covalent adduct with a reactive serine in a catalytic triad at sufficiently high concentrations. The HerE enzyme was subcloned into pET-28a(+) (Novagen) (7Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar) and transformed into BL21-Gold (DE3) cells (Stratagene). Soluble native enzyme (60 mg literâ1 Luria broth) was obtained by overnight induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside at â¼23 Â°C and was â¼99% pure after 2 consecutive rounds of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography (Qiagen). The amino-terminal His tag was removed by overnight thrombin digestion at 4 Â°C, and the enzyme was further purified by ion exchange chromatography with a MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, HerE was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl and concentrated to 15 mg mlâ1 for crystallization trials. Selenomethionine derivative enzyme was made and purified similarly from the methionine auxotroph strain B834-(DE3) grown in minimal media substituted with 0.3 mm selenomethionine (Sigma). The selenomethionine enzyme was concentrated to 6â7 mg mlâ1 for crystallization in the same protein buffer. The arsenic adduct, selenium-derivative crystals, were grown in 1.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1m cacodylate, pH 6.5, and native crystals were grown in 1.7m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1m BES1 buffer, pH 6.4. The apparent native molecular weight of the esterase was determined using gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 10/30 HR column calibrated with low and high molecular weight protein standards (Amersham Biosciences). A calibration curve was constructed from a plot of log molecular weight of the standard versus K av. Purified esterase (50 Î¼g) was applied to the column at a linear flow rate of 0.25 ml minâ1, and the elution volume was determined by monitoring absorption at 280 nm. Enzyme concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Steady state kinetic measurements for 6-acetylmorphine were measured at 294 nm in the presence of 10 Î¼g of protein in 100 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 25 Â°C with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A single beam diode array spectrophotometer. A molar extinction coefficient of Îµ = 1050 mâ1cmâ1 at 294 nm was used to determine the concentration of product formed during the reaction.K m and k cat values were determined by varying the concentration of 6-acetylmorphine and fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the Grafit 4 software package (Erithacus Software Ltd, Staines, UK). Inhibition measurements for dimethylarsinic acid were performed using phenyl acetate as a model substrate in conditions designed to mimic the crystallization conditions as closely as possible. The molar extinction coefficient E270 for phenol was determined from a standard curve to be 856.8 mâ1cmâ1. The reaction was initiated by adding 150 Î¼l of a 2Ã substrate solution to 150 Î¼l of a 2Ã enzyme solution in a 96-well UV plate (Costar). Steady state kinetics were monitored at 270 nm in the presence of 0.25 Î¼g mlâ1protein in 50 mm BES buffer, pH 6.4 (uninhibited reaction), and 100 and 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.4 (inhibited reaction), at room temperature with a SpectraMax Plus 384 UV plate reader (Molecular Devices). K m,K Mapp, and k catvalues were determined by varying the concentration of phenyl acetate in serial dilutions (50 Î¼mâ100 nm) and fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Kaleidagraph V 3.5 (Abelbeck Software). A single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data set was collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamline 11â1 from a selenomethionine derivative crystal at a high energy remote wavelength, and a native data set was collected at SSRL beamline 9â2 (Table I).

In brief, HerE has a single domain with the canonical Î±/Î² hydrolase fold, which typifies esterases with a Ser/Cys-Asp/Glu-His catalytic triad. The fold consists of repeating Î²-Î±-Î² motifs that form a central, predominantly parallel (except Î²2) eight-stranded Î²-sheet (strand order Î²1, Î²2, Î²4, Î²3, Î²5, Î²6, Î²7, Î²8) surrounded on either side by Î±-helices (Fig. 2, A andB). The core Î²-sheet and the Î²-Î±-Î² motifs are all right-handed, except for the unusual left-handed junction between strand Î²8 and helix Fâ², which is necessary to properly position the catalytic histidine residue in the active site (18Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In the hydrolase family of enzymes, insertions are commonly observed in the canonical structure at the amino and carboxyl termini and at the junction between strands Î²6 and Î²7. Such insertions are believed to modulate the substrate specificity of the enzyme (18Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 19Heikinheimo P. Goldman A. Jeffries C. Ollis D. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 141-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). HerE has two predominantly helical, â¼50-amino acid insertions, one at the amino terminus (H1, H2) and the other (H3, H4) between strands Î²6 and Î²7 (Fig. 2, A and B). Analysis of the packing within the crystal shows that HerE forms a dimer, where each monomer is related to the other by a crystallographic 2-fold (Fig. 3). In the dimer interface, strands Î²8 from each monomer align antiparallel to each other to form four backbone hydrogen bonds so that the Î²-sheet from one monomer is continuous with the Î²-sheet of the other. In addition, helices Î±E and Î±Fâ² from each monomer form coiled-coil motifs, Î±E-Î±E and Î±Fâ²-Î±Fâ² at the interface. In total, the dimer interface buries 1890 â«2 (20Connolly M.L. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1983; 16: 548-558Crossref Google Scholar) and forms 144 van der Waals contacts, 11 hydrogen bonds, and 8 salt bridges (21Sheriff S. Hendrickson W.A. Smith J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 273-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In comparison, the VH/VL interface of a Fab typically buries 1000â1400 â«2 (22Stanfield R.L. Takimoto-Kamimura M. Rini J.M. Profy A.T. Wilson I.A. Structure (Lond.). 1993; 1: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and hence, the HerE dimer is likely to be relatively stable in solution. Determination of the native molecular weight by high resolution gel filtration chromatography supports this model of a stable dimer with an apparent molecular mass of 73 Â± 4 kDa. This mode of dimerization is similar to that seen in other members of the hormone-sensitive lipase subfamily (15Wei Y. Contreras J.A. Sheffield P. Osterlund T. Derewenda U. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Holm C. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Crystals grown in 50 mm cacodylate buffer (dimethylarsinic acid) yielded a tetrahedral covalent adduct between the Ser-160 OÎ³ and arsenic (Fig. 4, A and B). Arsenic was unequivocally identified as the heavy atom from an x-ray fluorescence scan, an anomalous difference map calculated with data collected at the arsenic absorption peak (Î» = 1.0439 â«), and comparison to native crystals grown in the absence of cacodylate buffer. From this arsenic adduct, the prototypic catalytic triad was identified as Ser-160, Asp-260, and His-290 at the carboxyl end of strands Î²5, Î²7, and Î²8, respectively. Ser-160 (Ï = 55Â°, Ï = â121Â°) is located in the so-called nucleophilic elbow within the conserved GX 1SX 2G motif (GQSAG), a signature sequence for the hydrolase family (18Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). In the arsenic adduct, the divalent oxygen is in a tridentate oxyanion hole, where it could form hydrogen bonds with the backbone amides of Ala-161, Gly-88, and Gly-89, located between strand Î²3 and helix Î±A (Fig. 4 B). Two rotamers of the nucleophilic Ser-160 were refined in both the native structure (Fig. 4 A) and the As complex (Fig. 4 B), with arsenic bound to only one of the possible conformers. The occupancy of arsenic, therefore, was refined and found to be 0.61, which implies a mixture of bound and unbound species within the crystal. The dimethylarsinic acid adduct is 91% buried (20Connolly M.L. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1983; 16: 548-558Crossref Google Scholar) and forms 32 van der Waals contacts (21Sheriff S. Hendrickson W.A. Smith J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 273-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) in the active site. The pro-S methyl group corresponds to the methyl group of the heroin acetyl ester that is hydrolyzed by HerE (Figs. 1 and 4 B). This methyl sits snugly inside the acyl binding pocket (Fig. 4 B) and suggests that the enzyme may preferentially hydrolyze small acyl groups (three carbons or less) from esters. The pro-S methyl abuts the Ï-face of Trp-209, forming nine favorable van der Waals contacts. In addition, Glu-190 is buried at the back of the acyl binding pocket, forming hydrogen bonds with Ser-217 and a water molecule. The presence of the charged residue is unexpected given the neutrality of the acyl ester and differs from the acyl binding pocket of acetylcholinesterase, which is entirely hydrophobic (23Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I. Science. 1991; 253: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). The electronegative potential in HerE may facilitate expulsion of the negatively charged product, acetate, as part of an evolved negative design strategy to avoid product inhibition. Alternatively, the negative charge may be important for modulating the specificity of the enzyme for other as yet unidentified substrates. The putative alcohol binding pocket is fairly wide compared with the 6-acetylmorphine substrate. Therefore, it is possible to model morphine in several different orientations, which taken together implicate hypothetical interactions with Val-21, Phe-23, Tyr-33, Ile-92, Gln-159, Leu-208, and Leu-294. Based on this modeling alone, we speculate possible hydrogen bonding between the morphine nitrogen and the side chains of either Gln-159 or Tyr-33 but defer definitive characterization until a complex with morphine becomes available. Leu-208 (Ï = 72Â°, Ï = â53Â°) is located at the apex of a Î³-turn, which may be important in positioning Trp-209 in the acyl binding pocket. The amino-terminal insertion contributes many of the residues that line this putative alcohol binding pocket. This insertion has an average isotropic B value of â¼38 â«2compared with only â¼17 â«2 for the rest of the protein, and portions of this domain are relatively disordered in the electron density. These elevated B values suggest inherent flexibility in this part of the molecule that may be of relevance for substrate recognition. Our structure demonstrates that As(V)-containing organic arsenicals react specifically with serine, forming an adduct that resembles the tetrahedral transition state for deacylation (Fig. 4 B). Although the electron density shows the arsenic is coordinated by four ligands (two methyl groups, the Ser-163 OÎ³, and divalent oxygen), the bond angles are distorted from the expected tetrahedral geometry seen in small molecule crystal structures of cacodylate. This deviation from ideal geometry may indicate considerable strain or chemical reactivity within the enzyme inhibitor complex. In the refined complex, the bond lengths of As to Ser-OÎ³ is 1.98 â«, from As to divalent oxygen is 1.59 â«, and from As to the methyl groups is 1.82 â« (pro-S) and 1.88 â« (pro-R). These bond lengths are within the range of possible values for arsenate compounds surveyed in the small molecule Cambridge Structural Database (24Allen F.H. Kennard O. Chem. Design Automation News. 1993; 8: 31-37Google Scholar). Importantly, these refined values show that the oxygen is divalent, and As is in the plus five oxidation state. The bond angles of the arsenic adduct reveal additional strain from classic tetrahedral geometry seen in covalent adducts with phosphonate transition state analogs (25Longhi S. Nicolas A. Creveld L. Egmond M. Verrips C.T. de Vlieg J. Martinez C. Cambillau C. Proteins. 1996; 26: 442-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Millard C.B. Kryger G. Ordentlich A. Greenblatt H.M. Harel M. Raves M.L. Segall Y. Barak D. Shafferman A. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7032-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In fact, the bond angles suggest the configuration of the arsenic ligands in some respects is closer to trigonal bipyramidal than tetrahedral geometry. For example, the Ser-160 OÎ³ is apparently in an apical position as the bond angles are 90.2Â° (OÎ³-As-pro-S CH3), 108.2Â° (OÎ³-As-pro-R CH3), and 95.3Â° (OÎ³-As=O). In addition, the arsenic ligands CH3(pro-R and -S) and divalent oxygen are nearly coplanar and are separated by 115.3Â° (pro-SCH3-As=O), 116.5Â° (pro-RCH3-As=O), and 122.2Â° (CH3-As-CH3) (Fig. 4 B). These values differ from the ideal tetrahedral bond angles seen in the small molecule crystal structure of cacodylate. Considerable strain should be expected given that the natural transition state of the enzymatic reaction involves carbon, which has a much smaller atomic radius than arsenic (0.91 versus 1.33 â«). The native and complex structures closely superimpose (root mean square deviation = 0.2 â« for all CÎ± atoms). In both crystal structures, the His-290 NÎµ2 atom is â¼3.3 â« from the Ser-160 OÎ³, which approaches the upper limit of separation for these two residues in a catalytic triad (Fig. 4, A and B). His-290 is precisely oriented in this position by close interaction with Asp-260, Leu-208, and Trp-209. In the arsenic complex, the His-290 NÎµ2 is â¼3 â« from the pro-R methyl and, in the native structure it is â¼3.4 â« from a water molecule (Fig. 4, A and B). This water molecule forms hydrogen bonds with His-290 NÎµ2 and Ser-160 OÎ³ and would nearly superimpose on the pro-R methyl of the arsenic adduct (Fig. 4 A). Hence, this water molecule would be ideally positioned for activation and subsequent nucleophilic attack of the acyl intermediate. In both structures, alternate conformations were visible for the active site Ser-160. However, the alternative rotamer in the native structure differs from that in the arsenic adduct structure. Multiple conformations for the active site serine may be of importance mechanistically during initial substrate binding or product release. The observation of three serine rotamers is unusual in a catalytic triad (27Ghosh D. Sawicki M. Lala P. Erman M. Pangborn W. Eyzaguirre J. Gutierrez R. Jornvall H. Thiel D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11159-11166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and is possibly attributable to the relatively distant interaction with His-290. Three crystal structures are known from the hormone-sensitive lipase subfamily of hydrolases, brefeldin A esterase (15Wei Y. Contreras J.A. Sheffield P. Osterlund T. Derewenda U. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Holm C. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), esterase 2 (16De Simone G. Galdiero S. Manco G. Lang D. Rossi M. Pedone C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), andArchaecoglobus fulgidusesterase (17De Simone G. Menchise V. Manco G. Mandrich L. Sorrentino N. Lang D. Rossi M. Pedone C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The DALI Z score (28Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) for HerE and brefeldin A esterase was 37, which is exceptionally high (a Z-score > 12 is significant homology). Superposition illustrates that all of these homologous enzymes share similar helical insertions at the amino terminus and between strand Î²6 and Î²7, and all of these enzymes exhibit a similar mode of dimerization. Mechanistically, this subfamily employs three backbone amides in the oxyanion hole, similar to scattered reports for several other lipases and acetylcholinesterase, which belong to related esterase subfamilies (16De Simone G. Galdiero S. Manco G. Lang D. Rossi M. Pedone C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Harel M. Quinn D.M. Nair H.K. Silman I. Sussman J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2340-2346Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This tripartite oxyanion hole differs from the classic bipartite oxyanion hole seen in most proteases and esterases (19Heikinheimo P. Goldman A. Jeffries C. Ollis D. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 141-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The third hydrogen bond in acetylcholinesterase has been invoked to explain, in part, the remarkable diffusion-limiting rate acceleration for this particular enzyme (29Harel M. Quinn D.M. Nair H.K. Silman I. Sussman J.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2340-2346Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Because the 3-acetyl ester appears to undergo rapid spontaneous hydrolysis, it is impractical to measure Michaelis constants for this substrate. Therefore, the specificity of HerE was determined for two different substrates, 6-acetylmorphine (k cat = 12.6 Â± 0.6 sâ1, K m = 500 Â± 60 Î¼m) at pH = 8 (data not shown) and phenyl acetate (k cat = 3"
https://openalex.org/W2073016899,Transcriptional activity inside the nucleus of eukaryotic cells is regulated by ions such as calcium that need to be transported across the nuclear membrane. Here we show that an ion channel spanning the nuclear envelope between the cytoplasm and the nucleus could be regulated by an ATP-binding receptor of the P2X7 subtype. Activation of this nuclear P2X7 receptor by ATP in the cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cellular activity can be coupled to changes in gene expression.

Considerable evidence suggests that free arachidonic acid plays an important role in mediating agonist-induced Ca2+-sensitization; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for maintaining and regulating free arachidonic acid level are not completely understood. In the current study, we demonstrated that Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) is expressed in vascular smooth muscle tissues. Inhibition of the endogenous iPLA2 activity by bromoenol lactone (BEL) decreases basal free arachidonic acid levels and reduces the final free arachidonic acid level after phenylephrine stimulation, without significant effect on the net increase in free arachidonic acid stimulated by phenylephrine. Importantly, BEL treatment diminishes agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization of contraction from 49 Â± 3.6 to 12 Â± 1.0% (p< 0.01). In contrast, BEL does not affect agonist-induced diacylglycerol production or contraction induced by Ca2+, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (a protein kinase C activator), or exogenous arachidonic acid.

The latter is called the Ca2+ sensitization mechanism.

Several lines of evidence suggest that arachidonic acid contributes to agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization in vascular smooth muscle. First, many Ca2+-sensitizing agonists increase arachidonic acid in vascular smooth muscle, including norepinephrine (67Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol.

(Lond.). 1995; 486: 113-122Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Second, the time course and the mass of arachidonic acid released by GTPÎ³S are consistent with the role of arachidonic acid as a messenger in the G-protein-coupled inhibition of phosphatase (15Gong M.C. Kinter M.T. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 486: 113-122Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Third, exogenous arachidonic acid, not its metabolic products, increases 20-kDa myosin light chain phosphorylation and causes the contraction of smooth muscle at constant Ca2+ by dissociating and reducing myosin phosphatase activity (14Gong M.C.

Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Finally, a PLA2inhibitor, ONO-RS-082, concomitantly blocks agonist-induced arachidonic acid release and Ca2+ sensitization of force (26Gailly P. Gong M.C. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 500: 95-109Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of arachidonic acid in agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization remains to be established. One major obstacle in demonstrating the physiological importance of arachidonic acid in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction is that, to date, the enzyme responsible for agonist-induced arachidonic acid release and Ca2+ sensitization has not been identified. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is the key enzyme responsible for the release of arachidonic acid, although the sequential action of phospholipase C and mono- or diglycerol lipase or of phospholipase D and phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase and diglycerol lipase can also release arachidonic acid. PLA2comprises a large superfamily of enzymes that hydrolyze thesn-2 ester bond of phospholipids with the concomitant production of free fatty acid and lysophosphlipids. Based upon their cellular location and Ca2+ requirement for enzymatic activity, PLA2 can be classified into three groups: secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), and calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) (27Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13057-13060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). sPLA2 is an extracellular enzyme and requires millimolar Ca2+for enzymatic activity. Both cPLA2 and iPLA2are intracellular enzymes, but cPLA2 requires micromolar Ca2+ for its enzymatic activity, whereas iPLA2 is Ca2+ independent (28Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). A wide variety of Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 activities have been found in many different tissues (29Ackermann E.J. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), but until recently they were not characterized at the molecular level (30Ma Z. Turk J. Prog Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

In the current work, we test the hypothesis that the iPLA2 mediates, at least in part, free arachidonic acid release and Ca2+ sensitization of contraction in vascular smooth muscle. Our results show that iPLA2 is expressed in vascular smooth muscle tissue, and inhibition of the endogenous iPLA2 activity by BEL decreases basal free arachidonic acid levels and diminishes phenylephrine-induced Ca2+ sensitization of contraction. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of exogenous iPLA2 in mouse portal vein tissue significantly potentiates agonist-induced contraction. We conclude that iPLA2 is required for agonist-induced Ca2+ sensitization of contraction in vascular smooth muscle. New Zealand White Rabbits (male, 2â3 kg) were purchased from Myrtle's Rabbitry, Inc. (Thompson Station, TN). C57BL/6J mice (male, 7 weeks old) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). HELSS (BEL), an iPLA2inhibitor, was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA).3H-Labeled arachidonic acid ([5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid) was purchased from ARC (St. Louis, MO). Unlabeled arachidonic acid and a rabbit polyclonal anti-iPLA2 antibody (PRFNQNINLKPPTQPADQLV) were purchased from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI).

(Lond.). 1995; 486: 113-122Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the adventitia was removed carefully, and under a light microscope, the endothelium cells were denuded by gentle rubbing of the inner surface with a razor blade. The denudation of endothelium was verified by the lose of acetylcholine-induced relaxation in early experiments. Isometric tension of small strips (3 mm long, 150â200 Î¼m wide, and 75 Î¼m thick) was measured with a force transducer (AE801; AME, Horten, Norway) in a well on a âbubbleâ plate at 24 Â°C. Details of the solution used for studies on intact or Î±-toxin permeabilized were described previously (57Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5339-5342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the steady responses to high [K+] were observed, the strips were incubated in a Ca2+-free solution and permeabilized with 17.5 Î¼g/ml Î±-toxin for 60 min. To deplete the sarcoplasmic reticulum of calcium, all permeabilized strips were treated with A23187 (10 Î¼m; Calbiochem) as described (57Kitazawa T. Kobayashi S. Horiuti K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5339-5342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Fisher). Nonspecific binding sites on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were blocked by 4% nonfat milk in PBST buffer (PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20). iPLA2 was detected by using anti-iPLA2 antibodies from Upstate or from Cayman (Ann Arbor, MI). The immunoreactive bands were blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibodies (1:7500 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The iPLA2activity was assayed using a well established method (58Yang H.C. Mosior M. Johnson C.A. Chen Y. Dennis E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in a Ca2+-free buffer that virtually abolishes sPLA2 and cPLA2 activity. 1 mm ATP and 2 mm dithiothreitol were included in order to stabilize the iPLA2 and inactive sPLA2activities, respectively. In preliminary experiments, we found that the majority of the iPLA2 activity was present in the membrane fraction. Therefore, the membrane fraction was used in the subsequent iPLA2 assay experiments. The tissue homogenate was separated to the cytosol and membrane fraction by a 100,000 Ãg centrifugation at 4 Â°C. â¼100 Î¼g of membrane proteins were incubated with mixture of 14C-labeled and unlabeled DPPC for 90 min at 40 Â°C. iPLA2 activity was linear with an incubation time of up to 2 h (data not shown). The free fatty acid released was extracted by the modified Dole reagents, and the radiolabeled free fatty acid was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The iPLA2 specific activity was expressed as pmol of free fatty acid released/mg of protein in 1 min (pmol/min/mg). Rabbit portal vein strips were labeled with [3H]arachidonic acid (2 Î¼Ci/ml) in HEPES-buffered Krebs solution overnight at 37 Â°C (15Gong M.C. Kinter M.T. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 486: 113-122Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The strips were washed three times (20 min each time) in Krebs solution containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 10 Î¼m BEL or vehicle (Me2SO, as controls). The strips were then stimulated with 10 Î¼m phenylephrine for 5 min at 24 Â°C. The medium containing released [3H]arachidonic acid was removed and counted by liquid scintillation to determine the amount of arachidonic acid released. The tissue was used to determine the tissue DAG level as previously described (15Gong M.C. Kinter M.T. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 486: 113-122Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue lipids were extracted twice with chloroform and separated by thin layer chromatography. The bands corresponding to free fatty acid and DAG were scrapped off and counted by liquid scintillation. [3H]Arachidonic acid release and DAG production were normalized as a percentage of the total 3H counts incorporated into lipids. Rat iPLA2cDNA was cloned as previously described (33Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11118-11127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). TheSpeI/StuI-MluI restriction fragment of pBK-CMV/iPLA2 (33Ma Z. Ramanadham S. Kempe K. Chi X.S. Ladenson J. Turk J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11118-11127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was generated by PCR. TheSpeI/StuI-MluI fragment of PCR products was ligated into a modified version of pBluescript KS (pFLAGmluI), which contains the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). TheSpeI-StuI fragment of pBK-CMV/iPLA2and the StuI-NotI fragment of pFLAGmluI/iPLA2 were ligated into a modified version of an adenoviral shuttle vector (pAdtracgfptre) containing two expression cassettes, one that uses the cytomegalovirus promoter to drive green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression and one that uses the tetracycline response element promoter to drive iPLA2 expression (59Smith G.M. Berry R.L. Yang J. Tanelian D. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 3115-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To generate the pAd-iPLA2 adenovirus, an adenoviral backbone vector (pAdEasy-1) and the PmeI-linearized iPLA2 shuttle vector (pAdtracgfptre/iPLA2) were co-transformed into electrocompetent Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells (60He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The successful recombination of these two vectors was screened by restriction enzyme analyses. To generate the adenovirus, the identified recombinants were linearized with PacI and transfected into a mammalian packaging cell line (HEK293) by using LipofectAMINE-plus according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Expression of GFP and lysis of the HEK 293 cells were taken as an indication of successful viral production. Moreover, the expression of iPLA2 was confirmed by Western blot using anti-iPLA2 and anti-FLAG antibodies. Large quantities of adenovirus were produced by infecting HEK293 cells in 100-mm2 dishes and purified by cesium chloride gradient ultracentrifugation (61Gramham F.L. Prevac L. Murray E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology: Gene Transfer and Expression Protocols. The Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1991: 109-127Google Scholar). The physical number of viral particles was determined by optical absorbency. The Ad-iPLA2 and Ad/Tet-on (encoding a tetracycline-regulatory transcription factor) viruses were co-transfected into A10 smooth muscle cells or mouse portal vein tissue. The expression of iPLA2 was achieved by adding doxycycline to the cell culture medium (10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Invitrogen). The adenoviral transfection condition was optimized to obtain maximal expression of GFP, FLAG, and iPLA2 and to minimize the cytopathic effect of the adenovirus. For cultured A10 smooth muscle cells, a multiplicity of infection of â¼200 was found to be sufficient to achieve over 90% transfection. For mouse portal vein tissue, however, higher doses of adenovirus (1.77 Ã 109 viral particles in a total of 100 Î¼l/one-half mouse portal vein) and a longer incubation time (24 h at 37 Â°C) were applied. Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times. Data were expressed as mean Â± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by using an unpaired t test. iPLA2 protein is expressed in many cell types, including cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (62Larsson Forsell P.K. Kennedy B.P. Claesson H.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear whether the iPLA2 protein is expressed in fully differentiated vascular smooth muscle tissue. To address this question, homogenate from the medium of rabbit aorta, portal vein, or femoral artery were examined by Western blot analysis using two iPLA2 antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes of iPLA2. Both antibodies recognized one major band at the expected molecular mass of about 85 kDa, strongly suggesting that iPLA2 is expressed in the tissue (Fig. 1). In addition, since iPLA2has been shown to be the predominant phospholipase A2 in the brain, rabbit brain was included as a positive control. To investigate whether iPLA2 plays a role in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction, the effect of inhibiting iPLA2 activity on agonist-induced contractions was determined. BEL was used to selectively inhibit iPLA2activity, since it has been shown to be over 1,000-fold more selective for iPLA2 over cPLA2 and sPLA2 (63Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar,64Jensen P.E. Gong M.C. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We determined and compared PE-induced contractions in a single tissue strip in the presence or absence of BEL. In preliminary experiments, the muscle strips were incubated with BEL for 15, 30, and 60 min. We found that 60-min preincubation induced the largest inhibition of PE-induced contractions; therefore, it was used in all of the subsequent experiments. We found that BEL not only significantly inhibits the amplitude of the sustained phase of PE-induced contraction from 46.8 Â± 5.38 mg (n = 4) to 26.4 Â± 2.74 mg (n = 4, p < 0.05) but also potently slows down the rate of force development (the t 12from 3.0 Â± 0.86 min (n = 4) to 9.0 Â± 2.18 min (n = 4, p < 0.05)) (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, BEL did not significantly affect high K+ depolarization-induced contractions (Fig. 2 B). The fact that BEL selectively inhibits PE-induced but not K+ depolarization-induced contractions suggests that BEL selectively acts on an agonist-activated process. Interestingly, BEL does not completely abolish the PE-induced contraction (Fig. 2 A). In the presence of BEL, the sustained/slow phase of PE-induced contractions may be mediated by Ca2+. It may also be mediated by BEL-insensitive phospholipase A2 or due to incomplete inhibition of iP"

The production of ribosomal proteins is also post-transcriptionally feedback-regulated to match the rRNA production (reviewed in 5). Two different ppGpp synthetases (PS) exist in E. coli, the ribosome-associated PS I, encoded by relA, and the cytoplasmic PS II (6Gentry D.R. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3890-3893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), encoded by spoT (7Hernandez V.J. Bremer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5991-5999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Xiao H.

The protein PS II is also responsible for ppGpp hydrolysis (1Cashel M. Gentry D.R. Hernandez V.J. Vinella D. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). Increased levels of ppGpp not only down-regulate ribosome production but also induce transcription from several promoters (9Schreiber G.

As suggested by Schreiber et al. (9Schreiber G. Metzger S. Aizenman E. Roza S. Cashel M. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3760-3767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the E. coli promoters can be divided into three groups depending on their response to ppGpp: promoters specifically induced or repressed by the stringent response and promoters that are unaffected by the rise in ppGpp levels. Promoters dependent on the housekeeping Ï factor, Ï70, exist in at least two of these groups; one group is positively regulated by ppGpp, e.g. PuspA (11Kvint K. Hosbond C. Farewell A. Nybroe O.

Attempts to explain this dual effect of ppGpp have involved considerations of RNAP (RNA polymerase) availability and intrinsic differences in the kinetic properties of the promoters affected (15Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the availability of transcriptional and/or translational machinery play a role in global gene regulation in concert with classical activators and repressors (13Barker M.M.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) andE. coli (19Farewell A. Kvint K. Nystrom T. Mol.

Whether or not RNAP availability is involved in the actual mechanism of the stringent response has been discussed, and several models for this have been suggested (13Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 14Barker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L. J. Mol.

Arguments have been raised both for an increased and diminished availability of RNAP during entry into stationary phase. In addition, different models exist on how changes in the availability of RNAP would affect the stringent promoters. Barkeret al. (13Barker M.M. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 689-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 14Barker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and Zhou and Jin (15Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) suggest an increased availability of free RNAP in stationary phase since ppGpp destabilizes the open complex resulting in RNAP drop off at stable RNA promoters, which form intrinsically unstable open complexes. As a consequence of the increased availability of RNAP, positively regulated promoters are then induced since they are relatively poor at recruiting RNAP and are subsaturated during normal growth according to this model. Thus, this model encompasses a direct and active role for ppGpp on stringently controlled promoters (e.g. rrn) and a passive role on the positively regulated promoters (through RNAP availability). Jensen and Pedersen (16Jensen K.F. Pedersen S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 89-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), on the other hand, have argued for a diminished availability of RNAP during stringency. The âstringentâ promoters, e.g. stable RNA promoters, are dependent on high concentration of RNAP to transcribe at their maximal rate and are therefore argued to be repressed when the RNAP availability is diminished. Krohn and Wagner (21Krohn M. Wagner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23884-23894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that ppGpp increases pausing of RNAP during transcription in general but more at the stringently controlled genes, which could be another reason for inhibition of expression of these genes. Jensen and Pedersen (16Jensen K.F. Pedersen S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 89-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that one way through which the RNAP availability could be diminished during stringency is through ppGpp-dependent pausing and therefore sequestering of RNAP in transcription. However, Vogel and Jensen (22Vogel U. Jensen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12265-12271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that ppGpp-induced pausing is not required for the stringent response since the stringent response was still observed when ppGpp-induced pausing was abolished and the transcriptional elongation speed was made constant by the introduction of the nusAcs10allele. Thus, it is presently unclear if and how the availability of RNAP changes during the stringent response. There are also models for how the stringent response works that do not involve RNAP availability. For example Barrachini and Bremer (23Baracchini E. Bremer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2597-2602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that RNAP can exist in two forms, one with and one without ppGpp bound to it. The RNAP without ppGpp can only transcribe genes encoding stable RNA, while RNAP with ppGpp bound can transcribe from both stable RNA and mRNA promoters but prefers mRNA promoters. The fact that cells totally deficient in making ppGpp can still grow shows that there is no absolute requirement for ppGpp for the transcription of mRNA promoters, but no evidence presented so far discredits the idea that there are direct effects of ppGpp on promoter selection. The questions that need to be solved are whether variations in the level of free RNAP play a physiologically relevant role in gene regulation and if this mechanism is involved in the stringent response. The specific question we set out to answer in this work was whether variation in the levels of free Ï70-programmed RNAP does affect gene expression and, if so, what genes are sensitive to the altered RNAP availability? We used two-dimensional gel analysis to elucidate the global effects of underproduction of the housekeeping Ï factor, Ï70, during exponential growth and to study the role of ppGpp in this effect. We found that lowering the amounts of Ï70-programmed RNAP mimics the proteome of stringent cells and that this effect is not ppGpp-dependent. We speculate on the physiological relevance of these results with respect to the availability of RNAP during the stringent response. The E. coli strains used in this work are listed in Table I. The markerless ÎrelAÎspoT strain was constructed by K. Kvint and co-workers (20Jishage M. Kvint K. Shingler V. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) by the method of Datsenko and Wanner (24Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). Ï70levels were manipulated by using a system where Ï70(RpoD) is under control of the trp-promoter, Ptrp, (25Lonetto M.A. Rhodius V. Lamberg K. Kiley P. Busby S. Gross C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1353-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Levels of Ï70 were controlled with IAA (Indole-3-acrylic acid, an antagonist of the Trp repressor). The (CamR) Ptrp-rpoD allele was transduced into the different strains by standard P1 transduction (26Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972Google Scholar). The IAA concentration giving wild type levels of Ï70 was determined previously (0.2 mm IAA, (20Jishage M. Kvint K. Shingler V. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar)), and a 2-fold underproduction of Ï70 was accomplished by diluting to a final concentration of 0.02 mm IAA.Table 1E. coli strainsStrainRelevant genotypeSource/referenceMC4100Fâ araD139Î(argF-lac)U169 rpsL 150 relA1 flbB5301 deoC1 ptsF25 rbsRM.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) aerobically in Erlenmeyer flasks in a rotary shaker at 37 Â°C. The M9 medium was supplemented with a limiting concentration of glucose (0.08%), all the amino acids in excess (28Wanner B.L. Kodaira R. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 212-222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thiamine (10 mm). IAA (0.2 or 0.02 mm) and chloramphenicol (30 Î¼g/ml) were added when appropriate. After growth for at least five generations, samples were taken in exponential phase, and 1 ml of the culture was mixed with 5 Î¼l of [35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml, 1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) for pulse labeling. Incorporation was allowed to proceed for 5 min at 37 Â°C, then non-radioactive methionine (50 Î¼l, 0.2 m) was added and a chase was allowed for 3 min. The samples were processed for resolution on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels according to O'Farrell (29O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications (30VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5589-5593Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis in the first dimension was carried out between pH 3.5 and pH 10, and the gels were run according to the NEPHGE protocol (Non Equilibrium pH Gel Electrophoresis, (31Phillips T. Vaughn V. Bloch P. Neidhardt F.C. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimyrium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1st Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D.

The NEPHGE protocol was used since it results in two-dimensional gels where the ribosomal proteins (most with very basic pI) are visible. The second dimension was run on 11.5% polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled proteins were detected in a phosphorimaging device (Personal FX, Bio-Rad), and the images were analyzed using the PDQuest 6.2 software (Bio-Rad). Alphanumeric designations and/or protein names were assigned to protein spots after matching them to the reference two-dimensional images of the gene-protein data base of E. coli (33VanBogelen R.A. Sankar P. Clark R.L. Bogan J.A. Neidhardt F.C. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 1014-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or after performance of mass spectrometry. Western blot analysis was performed as described (20Jishage M. Kvint K. Shingler V. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Cell sampling and measurement of the cellular level of ppGpp with high pressure liquid chromatography was done according to Neubauer et al. (34Neubauer P. Ahman M. Tornkvist M. Larsson G. Enfors S.O. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 43: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For RNA and protein measurements, bacteria were first incubated in 5% trichloroacetic acid on ice and subsequently washed once with 5% trichloroacetic acid and lysed with 1 m NaOH (30 min at 40 Â°C). Protein content in the cell extracts was analyzed using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). RNA concentration was measured using the UV absorption assay as described (35Daniels L. Hanson R. Phillips J. Gerhardt P. Methods for General and Molecular Bacteriology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1994: 512-554Google Scholar). Based on the values obtained (normalized to optical density of the culture at the time of sampling), the RNA/protein ratio was calculated for cells underproducing Ï70 and compared with the control. A proteomic analysis demonstrated that the ribosomal proteins are immediately down-regulated 4- to 64-fold when wild type cells enter stationary phase due to carbon starvation (Fig. 1, B and D). The fold reduction in the synthesis rate is different for each of the ribosomal proteins but eventually the production of all the ribosomal proteins falls below the detection limits (data not shown). As demonstrated previously a set of proteins is induced during entry into stationary phase (Fig. 2 A). Among those are a set of Ï70-dependent proteins, e.g. UspA and GlyA (Fig. 1 D). In a ppGpp0 strain the ribosomal proteins are not down-regulated when the cells enter stationary phase (Fig. 1 E), and the protein production pattern, as seen on the two-dimensional gels, looks rather like a growing cell even after the entry into stationary phase (Fig. 1 C). It should be noted thatrelA + and relA1 strains behave indistinguishably during the conditions analyzed. The SpoT protein (PS II) is responsible for ppGpp production during the glucose starvation conditions employed (8Xiao H. Kalman M. Ikehara K. Zemel S. Glaser G. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5980-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the relA1 allele did not affect the proteome during these conditions.Figure 2The global effects on protein production by entering stationary phase in a wild type strain (A) and in a ppGpp0 strain (B). The graph was made the same way as in Fig. 1. The set of proteins in A and B were sorted depending on the magnitude of the response not on the protein identity. Therefore the proteins are not necessarily in the same order inA and B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Apart from differences between the rate of production of specific proteins in the wild type and relaxed strain, it is clear that the magnitude of the proteome response is much reduced in the ÎrelA ÎspoT mutant strain (Figs. 1 and 2). The proteome of the ÎrelA ÎspoT mutant strain appears to be locked in a growth mode. When Ï70 was underproduced in a wild type strain the ribosomal proteins were found to be specifically affected. When the Ï70 levels were lowered to half the level of a normal strain, the ribosomal proteins were down-regulated 2- to 3-fold (Fig. 3 A). This effect was not as great as the effect of carbon starvation, but this was expected since the cells are still growing in the Ï70underproduction experiment. The effect of Ï70underproduction on ribosomal proteins has been confirmed on the transcriptional level by the use of macroarrays. 2Miki Jishage, unpublished results. The ppGpp levels were not affected by the Ï70underproduction (Fig. 3 B), which means that the down-regulation of ribosomal protein production is not caused by elevated levels of ppGpp in this experiment. In agreement with the effect on ribosomal proteins the RNA/protein ratio was reduced (Fig. 3 C). This measurement can be used as a rough measure of stable RNA since total RNA consists of 98% stable RNA (36Baracchini E. Bremer H. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, the levels of RNAP Î±-subunit were not affected by the reduced Ï70 levels (data not shown). Lowering the levels of EÏ70 also affected the growth rate (Fig. 4 A), as has previously been shown for ppGpp overproduction (9Schreiber G. Metzger S. Aizenman E. Roza S. Cashel M. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3760-3767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10NystroÌm T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the case of Ï70 underproduction no steady state of growth could be obtained, but rather the growth rate decreased gradually over time (Fig. 4 A). The Ï70 underproduction levels were therefore checked at later times in exponential phase and showed that the level of underproduction did not change within the range of the experiment (data not shown). The effects of Ï70underproduction were studied at two different absorbance values during growth (A 420 = 0.5 and 0.7), and no significant differences in the protein expression between the two absorbance values were found (data not shown). Finally, the Ï70 underproduction was performed in both arelA1 and a relA+ strain with the same result (data not shown). The specific effect on ribosomal proteins is not ppGpp-dependent since the down-regulation of ribosomal proteins was obtained also during Ï70 underproduction in a ppGpp0 strain (Fig. 5 A). The global effects of Ï70 underproduction were less pronounced, but the same trend was seen as in the wild type strain (comparison of Fig. 5 A with 3A). In addition, the effect of Ï70 underproduction on growth rate (Fig. 4 B) was not ppGpp-dependent. Moreover, the level of underproduction of Ï70 was the same in the ppGpp0 as in the wild type (data not shown), and the levels of RNAP Î±-subunit were not affected in the ppGpp0 strain. In agreement with the effect on ribosomal proteins the RNA/protein ratio was reduced (Fig. 5 B). In this work we demonstrate that a strain unable to produce ppGpp is largely decontrolled upon the entry to stationary phase and its proteome appears âlockedâ in a growth mode. By comparing the effects of a wild type and a ppGpp0 strain going into stationary phase (Fig. 1) we can define the significant changes in the proteome mediated by the stringent response under these conditions. The ribosomal proteins are, as expected, down-regulated by the entry into stationary phase, and this effect is dependent on ppGpp (Fig. 1,C and D). Some proteins, e.g. UspA, are induced in a ppGpp-dependent manner as has been shown previously (10NystroÌm T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Kvint K. Hosbond C. Farewell A. Nybroe O. Nystrom T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A few amino acid biosynthesis proteins (e.g. the proteins encoded by carB,gltD, ilvE, metC, metE,metH, and tyrB) are identified on NEPHGE two-dimensional gels (33VanBogelen R.A. Sankar P. Clark R.L. Bogan J.A. Neidhardt F.C. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 1014-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but those were not among the proteins significantly affected by the stringent response to carbon starvation. In a recently published study using macroarrays, the only genes encoding amino acid biosynthesis proteins that were induced by the stringent response were the ones involved in the histidine and arginine biosynthetic pathways (37Chang D.E. Smalley D.J. Conway T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 289-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that promoters requiring ppGpp do not necessarily behave identically during a stringent response as demonstrated by the fact that the production of amino acid biosynthetic gene products, in contrast to the Usp family proteins, are not induced during carbon starvation induced stringency. We also show that it is possible to mimic the down-regulation of ribosomal proteins seen in the stringent response by underproducing the housekeeping Ï factor, Ï70 (Fig. 3 A). The expression of ribosomal proteins has been shown to depend on the availability of rRNA, and the ribosomal protein promoters have also been shown to be under direct stringent control (2Kajitani M. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1951-1957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Raghavan A. Chatterji D. Biophys. Chem. 1998; 75: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 4Raghavan A. Kameshwari D.B. Chatterji D. Biophys. Chem. 1998; 75: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects seen on ribosomal proteins in the Ï70underproduction experiment could be due to effects on rRNA production via transcription of rrn promoters causing a subsequent feedback control of the expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins. However, we can not rule out the possibility of direct effects on the transcription from ribosomal protein promoters. The effects seen are most likely not post-transcriptional since the ribosomal protein transcripts were similarly affected by a reduction in Ï70-programmed RNAP.2 It should also be noted that the total RNA/total protein ratio decreased during Ï70 underproduction demonstrating that rRNA levels decreased. The data indicate that among the genes expressed during exponential growth of E. coli the expression of rRNA and ribosomal protein genes is more sensitive than the average to a reduction in RNAP availability. The results support the idea of stringent promoters requiring high levels of free RNAP, as suggested by Jensen and Pedersen (16Jensen K.F. Pedersen S. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 89-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, rrn promoters may not work at their maximal capacity even during logarithmic growth since data from Squires and co-workers (38Asai T. Condon C. Voulgaris J. Zaporojets D. Shen B., Al- Omar M. Squires C. Squires C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3803-3809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a cell containing only one rrn operon instead of seven was still able to produce 56% of the wild type rRNA. Our results of Ï70 underproduction also go in line with the model of Jishage et al. (20Jishage M. Kvint K. Shingler V. Nystrom T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1260-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) who suggested that one mechanism of ppGpp-dependent gene regulation is to affect the relative competitiveness of Ï factors, possibly by affecting the affinity of Ï70 to the core enzyme. The lowering of Ï70 interaction with RNAP increases the opportunities for alternative Ï factors to bind RNAP core enzyme and redirect RNAP to their respective promoters, and at the same time it lowers the availability of RNAP holoenzyme for the Ï70-dependent promoters. If the mechanism behind the stringent control is RNAP availability, either by changing the pool of free RNAP or by affecting Ï factor competition or both, the constitutively stringent mutations in RNAP (e.g. (15Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar)) should also affect these parameters. One interesting feature of the stringent rpoB mutants characterized by Zhou and Jin (15Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,39Zhou Y.N. Jin D.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4292-4298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is that they express lower levels of Ï70. The stringent rpoB alleles had effects on transcription in vitro so the lower level of Ï70 expressed by these cells is not the only explanation for their action. But, considering the results presented here, it is possible that the lower Ï70 levels of the mutants fortify the stringent phenotypein vivo. The fact that lowering the availability of Ï70-programmed RNAP has effects that mimic the stringent response does not, per se, prove that a reduction of Ï70-programmed RNAP is part of a bona fide stringent response, but it is possible to speculate on such a mechanism. Even if changing the availability of Ï70-programmed RNAP is one effect of ppGpp in the cell, direct positive effects of ppGpp on expression of specific genes/proteins has been shown previously by Choy (40Choy H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6783-6789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using a coupledin vitro transcription-translation system. It is possible that the RNAP availability works together with more direct effects of ppGpp on specific promoters. Lowering the levels of Ï70-programmed RNAP also affects growth rate (Fig. 4, A and B), as has previously been shown for cells overproducing RelA and consequently ppGpp (9Schreiber G. Metzger S. Aizenman E. Roza S. Cashel M. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3760-3767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10NystroÌm T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It could be argued that the effects seen on the protein synthesizing system are merely an effect of the growth rate-dependent regulation of these particular genes. But, then the question remains how Ï70 underproduction mechanistically causes a reduced growth rate, since most gene products, with the exception of for example the ribosomal proteins, were unaffected by the reduction in EÏ70. Maybe the lowered growth rate is a result of the lower levels of the protein synthesizing system due to lower availability of free Ï70-programmed RNAP. The rrn promoters and ribosomal protein promoters are affected before the other promoters because they are, in this model, sensitive to changes in free RNAP. It has long been known that the stringent response and growth rate-dependent control have many effectors in common, but it is still controversial whether the one system, ppGpp and stringent control, is involved in the other, growth rate control. RNAP availability could account for growth rate-dependent regulation of gene expression whether or not the signal controlling RNAP levels is ppGpp. In this article we show that the ppGpp0 mutant appears locked in a growth state even after entering stationary phase due to carbon starvation. We also show that it is possible to mimic a stringent down-regulation of ribosome production by underproducing Ï70. We suggest that the effects on expression of ribosomal proteins by lowering the levels of Ï70 indicate that the ribosomal protein promoters are sensitive to the availability of RNAP. Thus, it is formally possible that the stringent response could encompass a mechanism of lowered availability of Ï70-programmed RNAP. Further experiments will address the question of whether available, transcription-competent, RNAP levels change significantly in response to ppGpp accumulation.

https://openalex.org/W2078701000,"The c-MYC proto-oncogene encodes a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation and broadly implicated in tumorigenesis. Understanding the function of c-MYC and its role in cancer depends upon the identification of c-MYC target genes. Here we show that c-MYC induces the activity of Protein Kinase A (PKA), a key effector of cAMP-mediated signal transduction, by inducing the transcription of the gene encoding the PKA catalytic subunit Î² (PKA-CÎ²). c-MYC-mediated induction of PKA-CÎ² gene transcription occurs in multiple tissues, is independent of cell proliferation and is mediated by direct binding of c-MYC to the PKA-CÎ² gene promoter sequences. Constitutive expression of PKA-CÎ² in Rat1A cells induces their transformation, and c-MYC-induced transformation can be reverted by pharmacological inhibition of PKA, suggesting that up-regulation of PKA is critical for c-MYC-associated tumorigenesis. These results indicate that, by activating PKA, c-MYC can provide endogenous activation of the cAMP signal transduction pathway independently of extracellular signals."

The structural prediction was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of these electronegative residues, resulting in loss of binding of Siah1 to SIPin vitro and in cells. The results also provide a structural basis for understanding the mechanism by which Siah family proteins interact with partner proteins such as SIP. seven in absentiahomologue 1 Siah-interacting protein substrate-binding domain human embryonic kidney tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor Skp1-Cullin-F-box Siah1/Sina family proteins represent mammalian homologs of the Drosophila Sina (seven inabsentia) protein. Sina is required for R7 photoreceptor cell differentiation within the sevenless pathway (1Carthew R.W. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 561-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The members of the family are E3 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases that regulate ubiquitination and protein degradation. For example, Sina binds a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). Heterocomplexes of Sina and another protein called Phyllopod form an E3 complex that interacts with a transcriptional repressor called Tramtrack, targeting it for polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (2Tang A.H. Neufeld T.P. Kwan E. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 459-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 3Li S., Li, Y. Carthew R.W. Lai Z.-C.

Like theirDrosophila counterpart, the Siah1 and Siah2 proteins contain a N-terminal RING domain that binds E2s followed by a cysteine-rich domain and then a novel domain implicated in binding various substrate proteins and targeting them for degradation. The reported targets of Siah-mediated degradation include DCC (5Hu G. Zhang S. Vidal M. Baer J.L. Fearon E.R.

Kaneko S. Nakanishi S. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, Siah reportedly interacts with Vav, a GDP-exchange factor for Rac/Rho (16Germani A. Romero F. Houlard M. Camonis J. Gisselbrecht S. Fischer S. Varin-Blank N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3798-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and BAG1, a Hsp70/Hsc70-binding protein that modulates cellular pathways involved in control of cell proliferation, cell death, and cell migration (17Matsuzawa S. Takayama S. Froesch B.A. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, Siah does not appear to target Vav or BAG1 for polyubiquitination and degradation despite its ability to bind these proteins. Thus, not all Siah-binding proteins are targets of Siah-mediated degradation. The physiological basis for the broad range of protein-protein interactions with Siah/Sina family members is as yet not clear. Recently, we identified a novel Siah-interacting protein (SIP) by using yeast two-hybrid interaction cloning methods (18Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). SIP is a Sgt1-related protein that provides a physical link between Sina/Siah family proteins and the SCF complex component Skp1. Similar to Siah/Sina family proteins, SCF complexes play a critical role in the ubiquitination and degradation of a variety of target proteins including cyclins, p27 kip1 , p21 waf-1 , E2F, IÎºB, and Î²-catenin (19Koepp D.M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 20Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M.

Biol. 1999; 9: 1180-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We elucidated a network of protein interactions involving Siah and SIP that regulate levels of Î²-catenin and thus the activity of Î²-catenin-dependent Tcf/LEF transcription factors. In this network an evolutionarily conserved pattern exists where Siah binds to SIP, which interacts with Skp1, which in turn binds to the F-box protein Ebi (18Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Here, to begin to dissect this network we have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the contact surfaces on Siah for SIP. The crystal structure of a fragment encompassing the Cys-rich domain and the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of murine Siah1a has been determined (22Polekhina G. House C.M. Traficante N. Mackay J.P. Relaix F. Sassoon D.A. Parker M.W. Bowtell D.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The structure reveals that the SBD of Siah1a bears striking structural similarity to the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) domains of TRAFs, a family of adapter proteins that bridges the cytosolic domains of multiple tumor necrosis factor family receptors to intracellular protein kinases (23Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). However, the oligomeric state of Siah1a SBD differs from TRAFs. Siah1a exists as a dimer, whereas TRAFs associate as trimers. In Siah1a a large concave surface is formed across the dimer interface. This region as well as two other clefts have been suggested as sites for protein-protein interaction (22Polekhina G. House C.M. Traficante N. Mackay J.P. Relaix F. Sassoon D.A. Parker M.W. Bowtell D.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24Reed J.C. Ely K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 8-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results of the present study identify SIP contact residues in the large concave surface of the Siah1 dimer, which represent critical sites for the first docking event in the Siah/SIP/Skp1/Ebi network. Mutations in Siah1 were generated by two-step PCR-based mutagenesis using a full-length human Siah1 cDNA (17Matsuzawa S. Takayama S. Froesch B.A. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) as a template. Products were purified by the QiaQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and then directly subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) with a N-terminal Myc epitope-tag (MEQKLISEEDL), thus creating pcDNA3-myc. Alternatively, the cDNAs were subcloned into yeast two-hybrid plasmids pGilda and pJG4â5, which produce fusion proteins with a LexA DNA-binding domain or a B42 transcriptional activation domain, respectively, at the N terminus under the control of a GAL1 promoter. HEK293T cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. For transient transfections, cells (â¼5 Ã 105) in 6-well plates were transfected with plasmid DNAs using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells (2 Ã 106) in 100-mm plates were used directly or transiently transfected with 6 Î¼g (total) of plasmid DNA. After 24 h, cells were treated with 10 Î¼m MG132 for 8 h and lysed in 1 ml of HKMEN solution containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 142 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 Î¼mphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 Î¼g/ml leupeptin, 1 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, 1 Î¼g/ml pepstatin and 20 Î¼m MG132. Immunoprecipitations were performed using agarose-conjugated anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz) at 4 Â°C for 4 h. After washing in HKMEN solution, immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using anti-hemagglutinin antibodies (3F10, Invitrogen) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences) and detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For yeast two-hybrid assays (17Matsuzawa S. Takayama S. Froesch B.A. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the yeast EGY191 strain was cotransformed with pGilda plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant Siah1/LexA DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, pJG4â5 plasmids encoding SIP/B42 transactivation domain fusion protein, and Î²-galactosidase reporter plasmids (pRB1840). To detect exogenous cytosolic Î²-catenin, cells were disrupted in ice-cold hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by passage 15 times through a 26-gauge needle. Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 Ã g for 30 min. Resulting supernatants (20 Î¼g of total protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were detected with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Tcf/LEF transcriptional activity was measured by transient transfection reporter gene assays using reporter plasmids pFOP-FLASH or pTOP-FLASH (containing wild-type or mutant Tcf/LEF binding sites cloned upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter and luciferase gene, respectively) as described (25Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar). The atomic model of Siah1a (22Polekhina G. House C.M. Traficante N. Mackay J.P. Relaix F. Sassoon D.A. Parker M.W. Bowtell D.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) reveals three âcleftsâ or âgroovesâ located on the surface of the Siah dimer that have potential as sites for protein-protein interactions (24Reed J.C. Ely K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 8-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The most striking is a large concave surface formed at the dimer interface by an antiparallel arrangement of Î²-sheets from each monomer (Fig. 1). The other two are symmetrically equivalent clefts in each monomer that are located between the Cys-rich domain that contains two zinc fingers and SBD. The electrostatic surface potential of these regions is different (Fig. 1); that is the central large Î²-sheet concavity is predominately electronegative, whereas the two smaller clefts at the ends of the oligomer are electropositive in nature. Thus, the potential exists for binding at distant sites that differ significantly in overall charge. Because SIP is a basic protein, we tested the role of the negatively charged residues in the concave surface of the Siah1 dimer for binding of SIP, representing a cluster of glutamic acids and aspartic acids in the concave Î²-sheet structure. In contrast to wild-type Siah1 protein, mutant Siah1 molecules (mutant A) with alanine substituted for Glu-161, Asp-162, Glu-226, and Glu-237 in the concavity failed to bind SIP in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2 A). Because Siah1 exists as a dimer, the large electronegative surface concavity is formed by an antiparallel orientation of identical Î²-sheets in each monomer. As shown in Fig. 1, this arrangement produces a symmetrical relationship between corresponding structural features of the monomeric subunits. Consequently, eight acidic residues reside in the large concavity; that is four from each monomer. Thus, substitution of alanine for four acidic residues resulted in a loss of eight carboxyl groups at the surface and a dramatic change in the electrostatic character of the concavity. Failure of the mutant with these substitutions to bind SIP identifies this concave region as the SIP-binding interface. Substitution of alanine for Asp-253 and Glu-265 on the surface of the opposite face of the dimer or Asp-142 and Gln-151 did not affect SIP binding. Two other regions were proposed as sites for protein-protein interactions in Siah1a (22Polekhina G. House C.M. Traficante N. Mackay J.P. Relaix F. Sassoon D.A. Parker M.W. Bowtell D.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These are electropositive clefts between the SBD and two zinc fingers on each monomer (see Fig. 1). These distinct sites are located at each end of the elongated dimer, separated by 46 â«. The mutation of Arg-214, Arg-215, Arg-231, Arg-124, and Arg-232 in these clefts to alanine did not block SIP binding (Fig. 2 A). Similar results with each of those mutant proteins were obtained using yeast two-hybrid assays (Fig. 2 B), confirming that the SIP binding surface is located on one face of the Siah1 dimer in a concave region (420 â«2) that contains a cluster of eight acidic residues. In this predominately negatively charged area, two basic residues (Arg-224 and Arg-233) are also found. To test the role of these positively charged residues on SIP recognition, these two arginines were mutated to alanine. The resulting mutant Siah1 molecule retained the capability to bind SIP, suggesting that the protein-protein interactions between Siah1 and SIP are mediated by ionic contacts involving the negatively charged cluster. Siah participates in a pathway leading to Î²-catenin degradation involving Siah and Ebi, an F-box protein that binds Î²-catenin independently of the phosphorylation sites recognized by Î²-TrCP (18Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We identified a series of protein interactions that link Siah to Ebi by association with SIP and Skp1, a central component of SCF. Expression of Siah is induced by p53, suggesting a mechanism that links genotoxic injury to destruction of Î²-catenin. In this process we observed that reduced activity of Î²-catenin binding Tcf/LEF transcription factors contributes to cell cycle arrest (18Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). To extend the present mutagenesis studies into a cellular context, we took advantage of our previous findings showing that overexpression of Siah1 induces degradation of Î²-catenin (18Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We performed transient transfection assays in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3 A), monitoring Î²-catenin protein levels by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3 A, overexpression of wild-type Siah1 markedly reduced levels of Î²-catenin protein. In contrast, the Siah1 mutant with alanine substitutions for the carboxylate cluster (mutant A) did not induce degradation of Î²-catenin; rather, it enhanced levels of Î²-catenin. Consistent with the binding results, the other mutant molecules retained the ability to reduce levels of Î²-catenin. Because Î²-catenin is required as a cofactor for activation of the transcription factor Tcf/LEF (26Peifer M. Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar), we explored the effects of wild-type and mutant Siah on Tcf/LEF activity using transient transfection reporter gene assays (25Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2927) Google Scholar, 27Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3496) Google Scholar). Expression of Î²-catenin induced a >10-fold increase in Tcf/LEF transcriptional activity in HEK293T (Fig. 3 B). When an equivalent amount of plasmid DNA encoding Siah1 was co-transfected, Tcf/LEF activity was reduced by about half (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to wild-type Siah1, transfecting cells with plasmids encoding mutant A Siah1 failed to suppress Î²-catenin-mediated activation of Tcf/LEF and instead increased transactivation of the Tcf/LEF-responsive reporter gene plasmid, thus confirming the specificity of the results. The other mutant Siah molecules behaved as wild type in this assay. Thus, we concluded that the contact residues required for interaction of Siah to SIP are critical for the function of this protein in cells. Siah1 also binds to the molecular co-chaperone BAG1, which has been reported to abrogate growth arrest by Siah1 (17Matsuzawa S. Takayama S. Froesch B.A. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effects of mutations in the acidic clusters on Siah1 interaction with BAG1. In contrast to SIP, BAG1 interacted with all of the mutant Siah1 proteins in the tested samples (Fig. 2), suggesting that SIP and BAG1 bind to different surfaces of the Siah dimer. The Siah1-binding domain of BAG1 is an Î±-helical bundle with an overall electronegative charge (28BriknarovaÌ K. Takayama S. Brive L. Harvert M.L. Knee D.A. Velasco J. Homma S. Cabezas E. Stuart J. Hoyt D.W. Satterthwait A.C. LlinaÌs M. Reed J.C. Ely K.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when basic residues at the two positively charged crevices on Siah1 (Fig. 1) were mutated to alanine, binding to BAG1 was retained. Thus the BAG1 binding site that is distinct from the SIP interaction region has yet to be elucidated. Recently, it was reported that the Drosophila protein Phyllopod interacts with the SBD region of SINA, a close homologue of Siah1 (29Li S., Xu, C. Carthew R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6854-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Deletion of five residues from the C terminus of the SBD region of SINA completely abolished Phyllopod association, suggesting that Phyllopod might interact with the concave cleft in the SINA dimer because these residues are located in this large concavity (22Polekhina G. House C.M. Traficante N. Mackay J.P. Relaix F. Sassoon D.A. Parker M.W. Bowtell D.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Moreover, the authors showed by deletion analysis that a 19-amino acid sequence in Phyllopod is necessary for binding to SINA (29Li S., Xu, C. Carthew R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6854-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). If this segment in Phyllopod assumes ordered secondary structure, it could easily be accommodated in a concave surface-like region in the Siah1 dimer that we have defined for SIP binding. Interestingly, there is no apparent sequence similarity between SIP and the SINA-binding domain of Phyllopod. The molecular basis for recognition of SIP and Phyllopod by the Siah1/SINA homologues awaits future structural analyses of complexes. The human SIP protein shares 93% identity at the protein level with a mouse protein, previously identified as a calcyclin (S100A6)-binding protein (CacyBP) (30Filipek A. Kuznicki J J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the CacyBP binds to S100 family proteins through its C-terminal region in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (31Filipek A. Jastrzebska B. Nowotny M. Kwiatkowska K. Hetman M. Surmacz L. Wyroba E. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21103-21109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, CacyBP can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitro (32Filipek A. Jastrzebska B. Nowotny M. Kuznicki J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28848-28852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is still unclear whether Ca2+ or phosphorylation of CacyBP/SIP affects its interactions with Siah1, Skp1, or other proteins. Furthermore, the physiological effects of S100 family proteins on Siah-induced degradation of Î²-catenin should be addressed. Because the large SIP-binding crevice identified here is formed by a symmetrical arrangement of identical residues from the two Siah1 subunits, a question arises as to whether protein-protein interactions with SIP involved the entire concave surface or intermolecular contacts with just one monomer, that is, a half-site. We observed a similar antiparallel arrangement of Î²-sheets in the dimeric MS2 translational repressor (33Ni C.Z. Syed R. Kodandapani R. Wickersham J. Peabody D.S. Ely K.R. Structure. 1995; 3: 255-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Valegard K. Liljas L. Fridborg K. Unge T. Nature. 1990; 345: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In the repressor, residues that are required for binding the RNA operator are located on six adjacent Î²-strands contributed by residues in three strands from each monomer (35Lim F. Peabody D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As in Siah1, a large concave crevice is formed across the dimer interface. In the case of MS2, the dimeric repressor binds one RNA operator. One RNA hairpin binds across the face of the dimer making asymmetric contacts with residues from both monomers (36ValegÃ¥rd K. Murray J.B. Stockley P.G. Stonehouse N.J. Liljas L. Nature. 1994; 371: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). For the Siah1 dimer it is possible that the contact surface accommodates a single SIP molecule, or alternatively, those two SIP molecules are bound to each symmetric half-site of the dimer. Further experiments are needed to determine the binding stoichiometries of Siah-SIP interactions. We thank M. Cuddy and M. Fariborzi for technical assistance and R.

https://openalex.org/W2041433366,"We used a combination of electrophysiological and cell and molecular biological techniques to study the regulation and functional role of the intermediate conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel, hIK1, in HaCaT keratinocytes. When we incubated cells with the hIK1 opener, 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (1-EBIO), to investigate the cellular consequences of prolonged channel activity, an unexpected down-regulation of channels occurred within a few hours. The same effect was produced by the hIK1 openers chlorzoxazone and zoxazolamine and was also observed in a different cell line (C6 glioma cells). After 3 days of treatment with 1-EBIO, mRNA levels of hIK1 were substantially diminished and no channel activity was detected. Down-regulation of hIK1 was accompanied by a loss of mitogenic activity and a strong increase in cell size. After withdrawal of 1-EBIO, hIK1 mRNA and channel activity fully recovered and the cells resumed mitogenic activity. Our data present evidence for a novel feedback mechanism of hIK1 expression that appears to result from the paradoxical action of its pharmacological activator during prolonged application. Because the down-regulation of hIK1 bears immediate significance on the biological fate of keratinocytes, 1-EBIO and related compounds might emerge as potent tools to influence the proliferation of various non-excitable cells endowed with IK channels."

In soybean, four 4-coumarate:CoA ligases have been described that display different substrate utilization profiles. One of these (Gm4CL1) represented an isoform that was able to convert highly ring-substituted cinnamic acids. Using computer-based predictions of the conformation of Gm4CL1, a peptide motif was identified and experimentally verified to exert a critical influence on the selectivity toward differently ring-substituted cinnamate substrates. Furthermore, one unique amino acid residue present in the other isoenzymes of soybean was shown to be responsible for the incapability to accommodate highly substituted substrates. The deletion of this residue conferred the ability to activate sinapate and, in one case, also 3,4-dimethoxy cinnamate and was accompanied by a significantly better affinity for ferulate.

The deletion of this residue conferred the ability to activate sinapate and, in one case, also 3,4-dimethoxy cinnamate and was accompanied by a significantly better affinity for ferulate. The engineering of the substrate specificity of the critical enzymes that activate the common precursors of a variety of phenylpropanoid-derived secondary metabolites may offer a convenient tool for the generation of transgenic plants with desirably modified metabolite profiles. The well regulated secondary metabolism of plants can be conceived as an adaptive network of specialized enzymes, responding to diverse environmental and internal stimuli. This network ensures an efficient partitioning of resources for the benefit of the plant. The phenylpropanoid pathway of plants represents a particular example for this concept. This pathway uses phenylalanine-derived intermediates for the biosynthesis of compounds used as UV protectants, defense chemicals, signaling compounds, and flower pigments, as well as for the building units of one of the most important structural polymers, lignin. One essential early step in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids is the activation of differently ring-substituted cinnamic acids to the corresponding coenzyme A thioesters. This reaction is catalyzed by 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL, 1The abbrevations used are: 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; 3,4-DMC, 3,4-dimethoxy cinnamate; 4-coumarate, 4-hydroxy cinnamate; caffeate, 3,4-dihydroxy cinnamate; ferulate, 3-methoxy, 4-hydroxy cinnamate; sinapate, 3,5-dimethoxy, 4-hydroxy cinnamate. 1The abbrevations used are: 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; 3,4-DMC, 3,4-dimethoxy cinnamate; 4-coumarate, 4-hydroxy cinnamate; caffeate, 3,4-dihydroxy cinnamate; ferulate, 3-methoxy, 4-hydroxy cinnamate; sinapate, 3,5-dimethoxy, 4-hydroxy cinnamate. EC 6.2.1.12), an enzyme that employs a two-step reaction mechanism related to other adenylate-forming enzymes (1Knobloch K.-H. Hahlbrock K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 311-320Google Scholar) such as fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, peptide synthetases, and luciferases. In the first step, ATP forms an adenylate intermediate with the carboxyl moiety of the respective substrate from which, in the second step, the activated group is transferred to an acceptor, mostly the sulfhydryl group of an enzyme-bound cofactor, followed by the concomitant release of AMP. Crystal structures are available for some members of the protein family, allowing the structural modeling of plant 4CLs (2Stuible H.-P. BuÌttner D. Ehlting J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 117-122Google Scholar, 3Stuible H.-P. Kombrink E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26893-26897Google Scholar). Plant 4CLs have been characterized from a wide range of species, showing different isoform distribution patterns. Some plants exhibit only a single form, whereas others contain multiple isoforms. From those containing multiple isoforms, these can exhibit similar or highly divergent substrate specificities in discriminating differently ring-substituted cinnamic acids. For example, in parsley (Petroselinum crispum) (4Douglas C.J. Hoffmann H. Schulz W. Hahlbrock K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1189-1195Google Scholar), potato (Solanum tuberosum) (5Becker-AndreÌ M. Schulze-Lefert P. Hahlbrock K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8551-8559Google Scholar), and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) (6Zhang X.H. Chiang V.L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 65-74Google Scholar), the multiple 4CL isogenes encode identical or very similar proteins. Conversely, soybean (Glycine max) (7Uhlmann A. Ebel J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1147-1156Google Scholar, 8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J.

Tsai C.-J. Lung J. Osakabe K. Ebinuma H. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5407-5412Google Scholar), hybrid poplar (Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides) (11Allina S.M. Pri-Hadash A. Theilmann D.A. Ellis B.E. Douglas C.J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 743-754Google Scholar), and Arabidopsis thaliana(12Ehlting J. BuÌttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Google Scholar) contain structurally divergent 4CL isoforms. Due to the pronounced differences at the structural, enzymatic, and regulatory levels, the four soybean isozymes deserve special attention (7Uhlmann A. Ebel J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1147-1156Google Scholar, 8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar). The two genes encoding isoforms 3 and 4 are very closely related and could not be distinguished with respect to the enzymatic properties of the encoded proteins. These isoforms were strongly up-regulated at the transcriptional level by elicitation or infection (7Uhlmann A. Ebel J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1147-1156Google Scholar, 8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar). In contrast, the structurally diverse isoform 1 was demonstrated to be down-regulated after elicitation, whereas isoform 2 showed nearly no response (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar). In addition to this rather unusual behavior, isoform 1 displayed an interesting biochemical feature: it represented the first 4CL for which a cDNA was isolated to date, where the encoded enzyme was able to convert sinapate to its respective CoA ester (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar), a step potentially of critical importance for the synthesis of syringyl-type lignin. Protein sequence alignments of 4CLs revealed the existence of conserved peptide motifs (5Becker-AndreÌ M. Schulze-Lefert P. Hahlbrock K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8551-8559Google Scholar, 7Uhlmann A. Ebel J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1147-1156Google Scholar, 11Allina S.M. Pri-Hadash A. Theilmann D.A. Ellis B.E. Douglas C.J.

Box I, described as a putative nucleotide-binding motif, has been used as a signature for the superfamily of adenylate-forming enzymes (13Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5594-5604Google Scholar, 14Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falque L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Google Scholar), whereas the absolute conservation of the box II motif seemed to be restricted to 4CLs (5Becker-AndreÌ M. Schulze-Lefert P. Hahlbrock K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8551-8559Google Scholar). The box I and II motifs have been the subject of recent investigations using mutant 4CL isoforms from Arabidopsis (2Stuible H.-P. BuÌttner D. Ehlting J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 117-122Google Scholar, 3Stuible H.-P. Kombrink E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26893-26897Google Scholar, 15Ehlting J. Shin J.J.K. Douglas C.J. Plant J. 2001; 27: 455-465Google Scholar). Interestingly, the modification of highly conserved residues included in each of these boxes, which have been postulated to be essential for the enzymatic reaction, did not result in the total loss of activity but showed rather subtle changes of the kinetic parameters of the conversion of caffeate to the respective CoA ester (2Stuible H.-P. BuÌttner D. Ehlting J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 117-122Google Scholar). Putative substrate-binding domains within the amino acid sequence have been identified by domain-swapping approaches (15Ehlting J. Shin J.J.K. Douglas C.J. Plant J. 2001; 27: 455-465Google Scholar) and have been shown to include specificity-conferring residues that were predicted to be in direct contact with the ring substituent of the cinnamic acid substrate, ferulate (3Stuible H.-P. Kombrink E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26893-26897Google Scholar). In our earlier report, we described the first cloned 4CL isoenzyme capable of converting sinapate to its thiol ester (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar). We now aimed to pinpoint the major difference(s) in the structures of the soybean isozymes that are responsible for the different substrate specificities. In a first attempt, domain swapping between one isoform using a narrow substrate range and one isoform with a broad substrate range was used to confine the regions important for the binding of the acid substrate. Second, structural comparisons have been conducted using 4CL protein alignments in conjunction with crystal structures derived from enzymes utilizing similar enzymatic mechanisms. This allowed the deduction of regions or single amino acid residues with a suspected importance in the enzymatic reaction toward the cinnamic acid substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis was then used to generate modified proteins, which were assayed for altered substrate specificities. Intriguingly, the deletion of one single amino acid residue fromGm4CL2 as well as from Gm4CL3, which is absent in wild-type Gm4CL1, resulted in the generation of new specificities and allowed the mutant enzymes to convert sinapate. The possibility of converting 4CL isoforms into sinapoyl-synthesizing enzymes may lead to valuable transgenic plants, where both lignin production and composition may be customized by using inducible promoters in conjunction with recombinant 4CL proteins expressing the substrate specificity of choice. Amino acid sequences were aligned and modeled using SWISS-Model (www.expasy.ch). The crystal structure of luciferase (Protein Data Bank codes 1LCI, 1BA3) (16Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Google Scholar) was used as a template for the prediction of the putative conformations ofGm 4CL1, Gm 4CL3, as well asGm4CL3dVal367. The plasmids pQE-30/Gm 4CL1 and pQE-31/Gm 4CL3, described in (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar), were used for the generation of hybrids between the soybean 4CL isoforms 1 and 3. Restriction sites available at identical positions in both cDNAs or generated by PCR at the respective positions were used to assemble different portions of the cDNAs according to Fig. 1 A and to yield the chimeric proteins depicted in Fig. 1 B. The modification of single nucleotide residues was performed using proof-reading PCR according to Refs. 17Nelson M. McClelland M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 279-303Google Scholar and 18Papworth C. Braman J. Wright D.A. Strategies. 1996; 9: 3-4Google Scholar. Briefly, for each mutation, a pair of oligonucleotides was synthesized including the desired alterations surrounded by at least eight nucleotides of the original sequence. The size of the primers was adjusted to yield a melting temperature of 75â77 Â°C by using the following formula: T m = 81.5 + 0.41 Ã GC (%) â 675/number of bases â sequence deviation (%). For the amplification, 10 ng of column-purified plasmid DNA (Genomed, Bad Oeynhausen, Germany) was used in a total volume of 15 Î¼l, including 1 Î¼m of each primer, 200 mm dNTPs, and one unit of Pfupolymerase (Promega/Serva). In total, 18 cycles were conducted, consisting each of 35 s at 94 Â°C, 45 s at 55 Â°C, and 12 min at 72 Â°C, preceded by a melting step at 94 Â°C for 2 min and followed by a final extension step at 72 Â°C for 10 min. Subsequently, the parental template DNA was digested withDpnI (Promega/Serva), and the amplified plasmids were purified and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5Î± (19Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 5: 557-580Google Scholar). The mutations were verified by sequencing. Heterologous expression, enzymatic assays, and calculations of isoenzyme specificities were performed as described (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar). Isolation of recombinant proteins was achieved by affinity dye chromatography combined with immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography. Briefly, crude bacterial extracts were applied to reactive blue CL-6B (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 14 mm Î²-mercaptoethanol, and 30% (v/v) glycerol (buffer A), the column was washed with buffer A including 0.6 m NaCl, and proteins were eluted by addition of 2 m NaCl. The eluate was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen), equilibrated previously in buffer A including 2 m NaCl. After washing (buffer A, 1m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), the bound proteins were eluted by raising the imidazole concentration to 200 mm. An antiserum raised against parsley 4CL (20Ragg H. Kuhn D.N. Hahlbrock K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10061-10065Google Scholar) was used in conjunction with anti-rabbit IgG from goat coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) to verify the expression from different constructs according to Ref. 8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar. E. coli DH5Î± was used for the propagation of recombinant plasmids, and the strain SG13009 (Qiagen) was used for the expression of proteins. The plant 4CLs belong to a family of AMP-binding enzymes utilizing a common two-step activation mechanism for carboxylate substrates as diverse as fatty, acetic, amino, or cinnamic acids or chlorobenzoate and luciferin (1Knobloch K.-H. Hahlbrock K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 311-320Google Scholar, 13Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Dunaway-Mariano D.

Genet. 1994; 242: 241-249Google Scholar). PheA, the phenylalanine-activating subunit of gramicidin S synthetase 1 from Bacillus brevis, which employs the same reaction mechanism, has been crystallized in a ternary complex with the substrates AMP and phenylalanine (22Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar). Luciferase from the fireflyPhotinus pyralis, another member of this enzyme family from which a structure is available, showed a structure similar to PheA, which allowed the presumptive assignment of the amino acid residues implicated in the binding of the substrates when compared with PheA (16Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Google Scholar). Since firefly luciferase and plant 4CLs share 31â33% identical amino acid residues, it was then possible to use the structure of the firefly luciferase as a template to model the hypothetical three-dimensional conformation of Gm 4CL1. All these proteins fold into a larger N-terminal domain and a smaller C-terminal domain with the substrate-binding pocket being located near the transition of the N-terminal domain to the C-terminal domain. This putative substrate-binding region located to the central part ofGm 4CL1. We tested this prediction by using a domain-swapping approach exploiting the two soybean 4CL isoforms, Gm 4CL1 andGm 4CL3, which showed the most diverse substrate specificities (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar). Following the assembly of different hybrids fromGm 4CL1 and Gm 4CL3 cDNAs (Fig. 1 A), the derived cDNAs were cloned into a bacterial expression vector (pQE30 or pQE31). As summarized in Fig. 1 B, nine chimeric proteins have been generated, from which five were shown to be inactive. The hybrid proteins H1 and H5, which each contained the highly conserved C-terminal domain of the other form, showed no differences in substrate specificities (Table I), excluding an impact of this protein region on the utilization of the cinnamic acid substrate. The replacement of the central region ofGm 4CL1 with the respective portion of Gm 4CL3 (H3, H4) resulted in a significant alteration of the substrate specificity. The hybrid proteins H3 and H4 accepted only the same restricted substrate range of cinnamic acid substrates as isoform 3 (Table I). The failure to generate active hybrid proteins in the reverse combination of isoforms 1 and 3 (H7, H8) may have been due to the N-terminal extension present in Gm 4CL3 as opposed to Gm 4CL1, which may have resulted in a structural perturbation that was not tolerated by an isoform 1-type enzyme. The hybrid forms H2 and H6, which were merged in the middle of the central region, as well as H9, which contained only the central part of Gm 4CL1 in the backbone of Gm 4CL3, all yielded inactive enzymes despite a positive expression of all of these recombinant proteins (Fig. 1 C).Table ISubstrate specificities of chimeric 4CL enzymes generated by domain swaps between Gm4CL1 and Gm4CL34CL14CL3H1H3H4H5Î¼kat kg â1Cinnamate11243.2240183134-Coumarate439101147217090060Caffeate186703654016220Ferulate3300542.600Sinapate1570310003,4-DMC358093000The recombinant 4CLs were expressed in E. coli, and specific enzyme activities were determined as described previously (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar). The cinnamic acid substrates were used at the following concentrations in the assays: cinnamate, 2 mm; 4-coumarate, caffeate, sinapate, and 3,4-DMC, 0.5 mm; ferulate, 0.1 mm. Open table in a new tab The recombinant 4CLs were expressed in E. coli, and specific enzyme activities were determined as described previously (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar). The cinnamic acid substrates were used at the following concentrations in the assays: cinnamate, 2 mm; 4-coumarate, caffeate, sinapate, and 3,4-DMC, 0.5 mm; ferulate, 0.1 mm. The involvement of the central domain of 4CL in the recognition of cinnamic acid substrates was surveyed in more detail. The sequential superposition of the central protein regions of PheA, which have been shown to build part of the active site cavity, in the first step to luciferase and then to a computer-generated model of Gm 4CL1, led to the selection of a protein region of 4CL presumably involved in the binding of the cinnamic acid substrate (Gm 4CL1331â348, Fig. 2 A). In addition, in the vicinity of the selected amino acid sequence, a tripeptide (VPP), which was strictly conserved between 4CLs (Fig. 2 A, positions 284â286 in Gm 4CL1), was observed. The residues Ala236, Ile330, Cys331, and Ala322, Ala301, Thr278 of PheA have been found to line both sides of the specificity pocket for the phenylalanine side chain, completed by Trp239 at the bottom of the cavity (22Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar). From these, four residues were located in or close to the highly conserved peptides shown in the restricted alignment of PheA with the soybean and Arabidopsis 4CLs (Fig. 2 A). Accordingly, these residues represented promising candidates for a functional role in 4CLs as well. Both regions of Gm 4CL1 highlighted in Fig. 2 A, therefore, were chosen for an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach to attribute functional importance to specific amino acid side chains by replacing consecutive residues with alanine. The substrate specificities of the recombinant proteins were determined and compared with the wild-type Gm 4CL1 enzyme (Fig. 2 B). One replacement (T331A) did not have any influence on enzyme activity, whereas eight of the mutations displayed major effects resulting in nearly complete loss of conversion of cinnamic acid substrates (G333A, Y336A, G337A, M338A, T339A, E340A, G342A, L344A, M348A) despite the positive expression of all of the recombinant proteins (Fig. 2 C). Strikingly, the modification of residues 284â286, as well as of residue 334, resulted in larger activities with the highly substituted substrate sinapate when compared with the respective reference values obtained with 4-coumaric acid. With the exception of the mutants P285A and Q334A, this alteration of the enzyme activity ratio was also observed with the artificial substrate 3,4-dimethoxy cinnamate (3,4-DMC). The alignment of soybean 4CL1with other plant isoforms for which the substrate range was specified revealed one crucial difference (Fig. 2 A and data not shown): the absence of a single valine residue (lacking between Pro343 and Leu344 of Gm 4CL1) in the region, which was shown to build the phenylalanine-binding pocket in PheA (22Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar). According to the designation of functional side chain residues, as identified by the alanine-scanning mutagenesis, this part of the putative binding pocket showed only a moderate influence on the selectivity for differently substituted cinnamic acids (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, Gm 4CL1 represents the only isoform that is able to activate sinapate and 3,4-DMC. We therefore tested the impact of the valine deletion by engineering it into the two other isoforms (Gm4CL2 and 3) of soybean, which have been shown to display intermediate and narrow substrate utilization ranges, respectively (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar). The mutant enzymes were indeed able to convert sinapate, although the affinities were shown to be rather low (K m values of 1208 and 323 Î¼m, respectively, Table II) when compared with Gm 4CL1 (K m value of 4.7 Î¼m). Gm4CL2dVal345 did not show any further significant alteration of the catalytic efficiency, in contrast to Gm4CL3dVal367. The latter mutant form did not only gain the capacity to convert sinapate but also the capacity to utilize the artificial substrate 3,4-DMC, showing a slightly better relative conversion rate in comparison with sinapate. Moreover, the efficiency of activating ferulic acid was greatly enhanced when compared with the wild-type 4CL3 enzyme (Table II). In the case of Gm 4CL3, the deletion of one single residue resulted in a considerable alteration of the functionality of the isoenzyme, albeit accompanied by a decrease of the efficiency for 4-coumarate, the highly preferred substrate of the wild-type isoform, as well as for caffeate.Table IISubstrate specificities of deletion mutants of the soybean 4CL2 and4CL3 isoenzymes in comparison to wildtype 4CL1K mrel V maxrelV max Kmâ1Î¼m% of 4-coumarateÎ¼mGm 4CL1 Cinnamate440080.002 4-Coumarate501002.00 Caffeate81370.46 Ferulate4.07218.00 Sinapate4.7326.81 3,4-DMC49861.76wtdVal345wtdVal345wtdVal345Gm4CL2 Cinnamate1700190072460.040.02 4-Coumarate 42 491001002.382.04 Caffeate 13 4637612.851.33 Ferulate 140 298711000.510.34 SinapateNC1208360.03 3,4-DMCNCNCwtdVal367wtdVal367wtdVal367Gm 4CL3 Cinnamate110036145370.040.10 4-Coumarate 91510010011.126.67 Caffeate 5013674531.480.39 Ferulate31001425100.010.71 SinapateNC32330.01 3,4-DMCNC311320.10The recombinant 4CLs were expressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity, and enzyme kinetics were measured as previously described (8Lindermayr C.

The aim of our present study was to elucidate the critical difference, inherited by Gm 4CL1, that allows this enzyme to accommodate a great range of differently substituted substrates. The analyses were provoked and facilitated by the availability of two other soybean 4CL cDNAs, coding forGm4CL2 and Gm 4CL3, which are distinguished fromGm 4CL1 by an intermediate and narrow substrate utilization range, respectively (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar). By successively pinpointing one region of the primary sequence of the enzyme contributing to the active site, a single amino acid residue was identified that, in Gm4CL2 andGm 4CL3, prohibited the conversion of the highly substituted substrates. One further important prerequisite for the design of our experiments was structural information describing proteins executing similar enzymatic reactions. 4CLs belong to the superfamily of AMP-binding enzymes, which also includes PheA, the adenylation domain of gramicidin S synthetase, and the firefly luciferase (13Babbitt P.C. Kenyon G.L. Martin B.M. Charest H. Slyvestre M. Scholten J.D. Chang K.-H. Liang P.-H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5594-5604Google Scholar, 16Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar). The structures of these proteins have been determined, in the case of PheA even as a ternary complex in the presence of the substrates AMP and phenylalanine (16Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Google Scholar, 22Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar). Based on the amino acid sequence alignment ofGm 4CL1 and the unliganded luciferase, a structural model was created, which then was used to superpose PheA. In the predicted conformation of Gm 4CL1, the putative substrate-binding cavity located to the central amino acid sequence including the amino acid residues 284 to 348 of ligase 1. This prognosis was verified by domain-swapping experiments (Fig. 1). The hybrid H4 revealed a conversion of the broad substrate range to the restricted one, as typified by Gm 4CL3, after the substitution of a sequence of just 288 amino acid residues in the center of the Gm 4CL1protein with the respective region of Gm 4CL3. The difficulties in generating active hybrid proteins experienced with the majority of the constructs prevented more in-depth studies of the localization of the regions that may be important for the determination of the substrate range. This may have been due to the higher divergence in similarity and size of the soybean isoforms 1 and 3 (58% identity (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar)) as compared with the Arabidopsis forms 1 and 2 (86% identity (12Ehlting J. BuÌttner D. Wang Q. Douglas C.J. Somssich I.E. Kombrink E. Plant J. 1999; 19: 9-20Google Scholar)), for which a larger number of active hybrid enzymes have been generated recently (15Ehlting J. Shin J.J.K. Douglas C.J. Plant J. 2001; 27: 455-465Google Scholar). The analyses of the substrate recognition profiles of the chimeric proteins from Arabidopsis pointed to the same region in the central part of the enzymes, as was found for soybean. Moreover, the dissection of this inner part of theArabidopsis 4CLs resulted in the designation of two substrate-binding domains (sbd I and sbd II), which independently were able to confer a change in the substrate range (15Ehlting J. Shin J.J.K. Douglas C.J. Plant J. 2001; 27: 455-465Google Scholar). Included in these domains are the regions that were analyzed by alanine-scanning mutagenesis in the present study (Fig. 2 A). The sequence ofGm 4CL1284â286 corresponds to a highly conserved tripeptide in the alignment of the amino acid sequences of a large number of the adenylate-forming enzymes (data not shown) and was therefore chosen for closer inspection. According to the structural data, this tripeptide (Leu279-Pro280-Pro281 in PheA) is in close proximity to the phenolic side chain of the aromatic acid substrate (22Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar). Interestingly, the exchange of each of the respective positions in Gm 4CL1 with alanine resulted in an increase of the activity with more highly ring-substituted cinnamic acids with the remarkable exception of the loss of 3,4-DMC activation by the mutation P285A (Fig. 2 B). This artificial substrate contains anO-methyl group in para-position, which may bear a steric hindrance in preventing a productive enzyme-substrate complex in the modified substrate groove. Although the participation of the tripeptide in substrate binding cannot be firmly deduced without the elucidation of the real structure of a 4CL in the presence of the acid substrate, our data clearly support the computational model ofGm 4CL1, which places this peptide at one end of the substrate-binding pocket. The different ring substitutions of the cinnamic acids implicate different spatial requirements for the substrates, which may or may not fit into the groove built by this stretch of amino acid residues, depending on their respective side chains. This conclusion was corroborated by the recent description of a substrate specificity-conferring amino acid in 4CL2 fromArabidopsis (3Stuible H.-P. Kombrink E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26893-26897Google Scholar). The position Met293 ofAt4CL2, which was speculated to correspond to Thr278 of PheA, was shown to influence the spatial arrangement of the substrate-binding pocket in such a way that only the exchange with a smaller residue allowed the utilization of ferulate (3Stuible H.-P. Kombrink E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26893-26897Google Scholar). Regardless of minor displacements of the PheA amino acid sequence in relation to different plant 4CL protein alignments used in the aforementioned publication (3Stuible H.-P. Kombrink E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26893-26897Google Scholar), published recently elsewhere (15Ehlting J. Shin J.J.K. Douglas C.J. Plant J. 2001; 27: 455-465Google Scholar), or presented in our study (Fig. 2 A), the accumulated results indicate that in silico biology can be applied to approach the questions posed in these studies. According to the alignment of Fig. 2 A, the second selected region of Gm 4CL1 (positions 331 to 348) corresponds to a small amino acid motif of PheA, which includes residues contributing to the fixation of both substrates (phenylalanine and AMP) by both main chain carbonyl oxygens (Ala322, Gly324, Ile330) as well as side chain interactions (Asn321, Tyr323, Thr326, Glu327) (22Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar). The importance of this central part of the polypeptide chain of Gm 4CL1 is reflected by the loss of activity observed for 9 out of 13 single mutant enzymes (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, the exchange at Q334A did not result in a total loss of activity despite the importance of the respective functionally analogous residue Asn321 of PheA. Here, the side chain was proposed to interact both with the exocyclic nitrogen of adenine as well as with N1 of the purine ring through a well ordered water molecule (22Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar). Moreover, the substrate specificity of the mutant Q334A displayed a reversal of the pattern when compared with that of the wild-type Gm 4CL1 enzyme: caffeate and sinapate were preferably converted, in contrast to coumarate, ferulate, and 3,4-DMC. This result could indicate a major influence on cinnamic acid substrate discrimination rather than on AMP binding. The most conspicuous difference of the central part of the polypeptide chain between Gm 4CL1 and all other known plant 4CL proteins was the absence of a conserved valine residue between the positions Pro343 and Leu344 of Gm 4CL1 (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). We substantiated the important contribution of this amino acid to the substrate specificity by engineering its absence into two other 4CL isoforms of soybean that were known to accept only a subset of the ring-substituted cinnamic acids as substrates (8Lindermayr C. MoÌllers B. Fliegmann J. Uhlmann A. Lottspeich F. Meimberg H. Ebel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1304-1315Google Scholar). The single amino acid deletions had a profound impact on the range of accommodated substrates, generating new substrate specificities for Gm4CL2 and Gm 4CL3(Table II). The mutation of ligase 3, which efficiently converted only 4-coumarate and caffeate, to a form that not only accepted two additional substrates (sinapate and 3,4-DMC) but also showed a drastic improvement of the affinity for another (ferulate), illustrated the relevance of this amino acid for substrate discrimination. Computer-based modeling suggested that the deletion of the single valine residue caused a displacement of the respective peptide loop ofGm 4CL3 and concomitantly resulted in a steric rearrangement of the orientation of the neighboring leucine side chain. Interestingly, the exchange at L344A of Gm 4CL1 resulted in the total loss of enzyme activity (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, recent evidence indicated the participation of additional neighboring regions of the polypeptide chain, which allowed the mutantArabidopsis enzymes to convert ferulate (3Stuible H.-P. Kombrink E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26893-26897Google Scholar, 15Ehlting J. Shin J.J.K. Douglas C.J. Plant J. 2001; 27: 455-465Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that spatial restrictions of the binding groove rather than specific interactions between the substrate and amino acid residues of the polypeptide chain may be decisive in determining the substrate specificity of distinct 4CL isoenzymes. In summary, the comparison of enzymatically highly divergent isoforms of 4CL from soybean enabled the prediction of functionally important amino acid residues. Active mutant enzymes with single amino acid exchanges revealed some of the structural principles responsible for the ability to utilize differently substituted cinnamic acids to a different extent. The principles detected for 4CL isozymes from soybean as well as from other sources (2Stuible H.-P. BuÌttner D. Ehlting J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 117-122Google Scholar, 3Stuible H.-P. Kombrink E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26893-26897Google Scholar) help to understand the catalytic action of this important enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway of plants. They could be useful also for the design of novel 4CL specificities. For example, the manipulation of the lignin composition of trees used for paper production is an economically important trait since a higher content of syringyl monolignols improves the commercial lignin degradation. Although recent discoveries concerning alternative pathways for the synthesis of monolignols provide interesting targets for genetically modified crop plants (23Humphreys J.M. Hemm M.R. Chapple C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10045-10050Google Scholar, 24Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Chiang V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6537-6545Google Scholar, 25Guo D. Chen F. Inoue K. Blount J.W. Dixon R.A. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 73-88Google Scholar), the utilization of 4CL to preferentially activate a range of cinnamic acid substrates leading to highly substituted lignin building units may also constitute a valuable tool. We thank K. Hahlbrock (KoÌln, Germany) for providing the P. crispum 4CL antiserum and A. MithoÌfer for critically reading the manuscript and valuable discussions."

These hyperplasias eventually develop into benign papillomas, some of which become malignant tumors such as squamous cell carcinomas or spindle cell tumors (7Spalding J.W. Momma J. Elwell M.R. Tennant R.W. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The in vivo TgÂ·AC mouse model is a valuable tool to study the early stages of skin carcinogenesis. The epidermis is a stratified, rapidly renewing tissue in which terminally differentiated cells are continuously lost from the skin surface and replaced by an intricate and highly regulated proliferative process. Skin cells are regenerated through the proliferative capacity of keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs) and transit amplifying (TA) cells in the basal layer. KSCs are a minor subpopulation of relatively quiescent cells that have broad proliferative potential and an unlimited capacity for self-renewal (8Cotsarelis G. Sun T.-T. Lavker R.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 1329-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar, 9Morris R.J. Potten C.S. Cell Prolif. 1994; 27: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that carcinogens generate mutations in the population of stem cells which are transformed them into initiated preneoplastic cells (10Berenblum I. Cancer Res. 1941; 1: 807-814Google Scholar). It has also been reported that tumor promoters such as TPA preferentially stimulate initiated keratinocytes and lead to clonal expansion of the mutant cell population (11Yuspa S.H. Ben T. Hennings H. Lichti U. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2344-2349PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence supports the proposal that KSCs are a major target in skin tumorigenesis (12Lavker R.M. Miller S. Wilson C.

KSCs can be isolated from heterogeneous tissue samples and used for investigations of the mechanisms of epidermal tissue homeostasis, wound repair, and for studying the role of stem cells in skin carcinogenesis. However, it is difficult to obtain KSCs because there are few reliable and specific molecular markers that discriminate KSCs from TA cells, which have more restricted proliferative potential within the germinative/basal layer. Recently, Li et al. (16Li A. Simmons P.J. Kaur P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3902-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) identified and characterized a candidate marker for human KSCs, integrin Î±6bri 10G7dim. Tani et al. (17Tani H. Morris R.J. Kaur P.

In addition, Trempus et al. (18Trempus C.S. Morris R.J. Bortner C.D. Faircloth R.S. Reece J.M. Tennant R.W. Proc. Am. Assoc.

Many of these genes were identified using in vitro methods and cultured cell lines or two-step in vivo carcinogenesis with mouse skin as a target. These studies should be interpreted with some caution because the exact nature of the target cells may not be known with precision. This study identifies a novel gene that is induced in TPA-treated cells using a different approach than previous studies. The candidate integrin Î±6+ CD34+ keratinocyte progenitor cells were isolated from hyperplastic skin of TPA-treated animals and their gene expression analyzed using cDNA microarray. This method employs FACS, switching mechanism at the 5â² end of RNA templates (SMART) cDNA amplification, and mouse cDNA array technology. Eleven TPA-responsive genes were identified in the TgÂ·AC mouse; nine genes were significantly up-regulated by TPA, and two genes were remarkably down-regulated by TPA. Dss1 was selected from the nine TPA-up-regulated genes for further characterization. Dss1 was originally identified on human chromosome 7q21.3-q22.1 as a gene deleted in patients with the heterogeneous limb developmental disorder SHFM1. Dss1 encodes a 70-amino acid, highly acidic peptide (26Crackower M.A. Scherer S.W. Rommens J.M. Hui C.-C. Poorkaj P. Soder S. Cobben J.M. Hudgins L. Evans J.P. Tsui L.-C. Hum. Mol.

Up-regulation of Dss1 was detected in TPA-treated mice using cDNA microarray and verified by semiquantitative RT-PCR, Northern blot, and in situhybridization. Functional analysis of Dss1 gene in TPA susceptible JB6 Cl 41-5a preneoplastic epidermal cells suggests that it is required for cell proliferation and neoplastic transformation. Eight- to 10-week-old male homozygous TgÂ·AC mice were obtained from Taconic Laboratory of Animals and Services (Germantown, NY). Animal studies were carried out in compliance with NIH Guidelines for Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Mouse fibroblast cells Rat-1 and monkey transformed kidney cells COS-1 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Dulbecco's MEM) containing 10% FBS. NIH/3T3 cells were maintained as described previously (28Paules R.S. Buccione R. Moschel R.C. Vande Woude G.F. Eppig J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Five micrograms of TPA (Sigma) in 200 Î¼l of acetone was applied topically to groups of 5 homozygous male TgÂ·AC mice twice weekly for 2 weeks. Untreated control mice were sacrificed on day 1 (NS). Four dosing protocols were used as follows. Mice were dosed on day 1 and sacrificed on day 5 (designated as TPA1); mice were dosed on days 1 and 5 and sacrificed on day 8 (designated as TPA2); mice were dosed on days 1, 5, and 8 and sacrificed on day 12 (designated as TPA3); mice were dosed on days 1, 5, 8, and 12 and sacrificed at least 48 h after the last dose (designated as TPA4). Papillomas and malignant tumors (one spindle cell tumor and two squamous cell carcinomas) were identified, removed, and characterized as described previously (7Spalding J.W. Momma J. Elwell M.R. Tennant R.W. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). AtlasTM Mouse 1.2 MicroArray carrying 1176 cDNAs was obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The keratinocytes were harvested from the dorsal skin of TgÂ·AC mice (29Morris R.J. Fischer S.M. Klein Szanto A.J. Slaga T.J. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1991; 23: 587-602Google Scholar), and the integrin Î±6+ CD34+keratinocyte progenitor cells were isolated using FACS (18Trempus C.S. Morris R.J. Bortner C.D. Faircloth R.S.

Total RNAs were extracted from TPA-treated or -untreated keratinocyte progenitor cells using StrataPrepR Total RNA Miniprep Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Ten nanograms of total RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified using the Atlas SMARTTM system (Clontech). Five hundred nanograms of purified SMART cDNA were labeled for 30 min at 50 Â°C with [Î±-33P]dATP (10 Î¼Ci/Î¼l; >2500 Ci/mmol; AmershamBiosciences) using Klenow DNA polymerase (Clontech) and random hexamer priming. Array membrane was prehybridized with prewarmed ExpressHyb for 30 min with continuous agitation at 68 Â°C, and hybridized overnight with [Î±-33P]dATP-labeled probes (3.7 Ã 106cpm/ml). The membrane was washed four times in 2Ã saline sodium citrate (SSC), 1% SDS for 30 min at 68 Â°C, and two times in 0.1Ã SSC, 0.5% SDS. Array membrane was scanned with a phosphorimager (Typhoon 8600, Amersham Biosciences), and signals were quantified using ImageQuant 5.1 software (Amersham Biosciences). The full-length Dss1 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using TgÂ·AC mice skin total RNA. The Dss1 forward and reverse primers were 5â²-CAC CAT GTC TGA AAA GAA GCA GCC-3â² and 5â²-TGA TGT CTC CAT CTT GTA GCC GTG CTT-3â², respectively. The PCR amplifiedDss1 cDNA was cloned into V5-His-tagged pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPOc mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Dss1 cDNA fragment was inserted into retroviral vector by digesting pcDNA3.1D/Dss1-V5-His plasmid with HindIII andNotI and ligated into the HindIII-NotI sites of the pLNCX2 (Clontech) using the LigaFastTM Rapid DNA Ligation System (Promega, San Luis, CA). A construct expressing Dss1 sense or antisense RNA was generated as follows; pcDNA3.1D/Dss1-V5-His was digested with BamHI and XbaI, and the Dss1cDNA-containing fragment was cloned into theBamHI-XbaI sites of the T3/T7-U19 plasmid (Ambion, Austin, TX). The pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) was used to express the full-length Dss1 protein fused to the C terminus of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the JB6 Cl 41-5a epidermal cells. The pcDNA3.1D/Dss1-V5-His plasmid was digested sequentially withKpnI and ApaI and ligated into theKpnI-ApaI sites of the pEGFP-C3 plasmid using the LigaFastTM Rapid DNA Ligation System (Promega). The pEGFP-C3 plasmid expressing the native EGFP protein was used as a control. All the construct sequences were verified using an automated Applied Biosystems sequencer and the BigDyeTM Terminator Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Foster City, CA). Plasmid DNAs were purified using purification kits from Qiagen (Stanford Valencia, CA) and were endotoxin-free when used for transfection in mammalian cells. Cells were transfected with vector (mock), pcDNA3.1D/Dss1-V5-His, or pEGFP-C3/Dss1 plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM reagents (Invitrogen) or by infection with virions packaged with ecotropic packaging cells RetroPackTM PT-67 (Clontech). The recombinant pLNCX2 retroviral vector carries mouseDss1 gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter andneoR gene driven by the long terminal repeat promoter. Plasmid-transfected and virus-infected cells were cultured for at least 2 weeks in medium containing 400 Î¼g/ml Geneticin (G418) (Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed by Western blot or RT-PCR to confirm the expression of Dss1. The single-stranded cDNA was prepared from total RNA using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase SuperScript II (Invitrogen) with oligo(dT) primer and used as a template for PCR. The primers used for PCR were as follows: Dss1 sense (5â²-GAC GAC GAG TTC GAG GAG TTT CCC G-3â²) and antisense (5â²-GTG GTA GAG TCC ATG ATT GAG GTT CC-3â²) are from Gensetoligos Corp. (La Jolla, CA); pLNCX2 sequencing/PCR forward (2882â2906) (5â²-AGC TGG TTT AGT GAA CCG TCA GAT C-3â²) and reverse primers (3057â3032) (5â²-ACC TAC AGG TGG GGT CTT TCA TTC CC-3â²) are from Clontech; Î²2-microglobulin sense (5â²-GAC TGG TCT TTC TAT ATC CTG G-3â²) and antisense (5â²-CTT TCT GCG TGC ATA AAT TG-3â²) are from Sigma; and Î²-actin sense and antisense primers were obtained from Clontech. PCR cycling was as follows: denaturation (94 Â°C, 45 s), annealing (58 Â°C, 45 s), and extension (72 Â°C, 2 min) for 30 cycles. Reaction was carried out in a PerkinElmer 9600 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and PCR products were analyzed using 2% agarose gels. Total RNA was prepared using a TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen) and digested with RNase-free DNase 1 (Ambion). Eight micrograms of isolated RNAs were separated electrophoretically on a 1% agarose gel containing glyoxal and transferred onto a BrightStar-Plus nylon membrane (Ambion). The membrane was UV-cross-linked and probed with [Î±-32P]UTP-labeled Dss1 antisense RNA (1 Ã 106 cpm/ml). The riboprobe was prepared usingin vitro Strip-EZTM T7 RNA transcription kit (Ambion) with EcoRI-linearized T3/T7-U19-Dss1 as a template. Autoradiographs were developed using Amersham Biosciences hyperfilmTM MP at â80 Â°C. The integrity of total RNA is good, and the ratio of 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNAs is â¼2:1 in all samples. The signals were quantified using ImageQuant 5.1 software (Molecular Dynamics). The in situ hybridization assay was performed as previously described (30Hansen L.A. Tennant R.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1994; 9: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cutaneous tumors were removed from TgÂ·AC mice and fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The tissues were paraffin-embedded, and sections (6 Î¼m) were cut onto SuperFrost plus microscope slides (Daigger, Vernon Hills, IL). The sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated by successive washes in xylene and graded alcohols to 2Ã SSC, then applied with â¼2 Ã 106 cpm of 35S-labeledDss1 sense or antisense riboprobes. The riboprobes were prepared from T7/T3-U19-Dss1 plasmid linearized with EcoRI (antisense) or HindIII (sense) using in vitroStrip-EZTM T7 or T3 RNA transcription kit (Ambion). Following 40 Â°C overnight hybridization, the tissues were washed in 2Ã SSC plus 50% formamide at 40 Â°C, then in 2Ã SSC, 1Ã SSC, 0.5Ã SSC, and 0.5Ã SSC, 30 min each wash at room temperature. To remove unbound probe, the tissues were incubated with 20 Î¼l of RNase (10 mg/ml). After several washes, the slides were dehydrated in graded alcohols and completely air-dried. The slides were then dipped into NTB-3 autoradiographic emulsion (Eastman Kodak), exposed for 10 days at room temperature in the dark, dried in a light-tight container, and developed in Kodak D19 fixer and developer. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, covered with coverslips, and photographed under dark-field illumination (model BX51, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan). The eighty nanograms of different green fluorescent protein (GFP) constructs, pEGFP-C3 and pEGFP-C3/Dss1, were transiently transfected into the JB6 Cl 41-5a cells cultured at 37 Â°C in eight-well culture slides (Falcon, Bedford, MA) at a cell density of 2 Ã 105 cells/well using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM reagents (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The GFP fluorescence was observed 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1Ã phosphate-buffered saline buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in 1Ã phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. After washing five times for 2 min each, cells were mounted with the Prolong antifade medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For nuclear localization, a DNA-bound nucleic dye 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector, Burlingame, CA) was used. Cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy using a Leica DMRBE microscope (Wetzlar GmbH) equipped with a 63Ã objective and 100-watt mercury source. The images were taken with a Chroma GFP filter set for EGFP (excitation maximum 488 nm, emission maximum 507 nm), a DAPI filter set for chromatin (excitation 351/364 nm, emission 410/505 nm), a SPOT RT cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI), and MetaMorph 5.0 software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). Individual images were pseudocolored and overlaid. For immunocytochemical analysis, cells (1 Ã 106) were transiently transfected with 4 Î¼g of pcDNA3.1D/Dss1-V5-His in a 10-cm tissue culture plate using LipofectAMINE PLUSTMreagents (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated for 48 h, and 2 Ã 105 cells were seeded on eight-well culture slides until cells attached. Cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min, probed with normal mouse IgG (negative control) or anti-V5 tag mouse monoclonal antibody for 30 min, and stained with the M.O.M. Immunodetection Kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA) according to instructions from the manufacturer. The photographs were taken under the BX51 light microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Cells were lysed as described previously (32Wei S.-J. Chao Y. Shih Y.-L. Yang D.-M. Hung Y.-M. Yang W.K. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). The whole-cell lysates were sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 100,000 Ã g for 1 h at 4 Â°C. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated electrophoretically on 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (AmershamBiosciences). The membranes were probed with primary antibodies including anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:5000) (Invitrogen) and anti-EGFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:2000) (Clontech). These antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000) (Amersham Biosciences) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were striped and rehybridized with an anti-Î±-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1000) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for control to confirm loading efficiency. Cells were seeded overnight at a density of 2 Ã 105 cells/well in six-well plates. Cells were transfected with 1 Î¼g of vector or pcDNA3.1D/Dss1-V5-His and selected in medium containing G418 selection for 14â21 days. Foci were fixed with methanol/acetic acid (v/v = 1/3), stained with 0.4% crystal violet (methanol/acetic acid), and counted as described previously (33Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Growth curves were generated as described previously (33Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (1 Ã 104) were grown as described above. The medium was changed every 3â4 days. Cell number was counted in triplicate on a hemocytometer every other day for 8 days. Colony formation in soft agar was assayed as described previously (33Cox A.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 277-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In a 60-mm tissue culture dish, 1 Ã 104 cells were resuspended in 0.33% Noble agar (Difco, Kansas City, MO) in Eagle's MEM with 10% FBS and layered over 5 ml 0.5% agar in Eagle's MEM with 10% FBS. Cells were grown at 37 Â°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, and colonies with more than 8 cells were counted 14â18 days after seeding. The goal of this study was to identify novel genes induced in the skin by TPA using an in vivo mouse model system. Gene expression profiles were determined using a mouse cDNA array spotted with 1176 genes. TgÂ·AC mice were treated with TPA, and keratinocyte progenitor cells carrying the cell surface markers, integrin Î±6 and CD34, were isolated by FACS. Control cells were harvested from animals not treated with TPA. The cDNA was prepared from 10 ng of RNase-free DNase 1-treated total RNA from keratinocyte progenitor cells by two independent methods: reverse transcription and PCR-based SMART amplification. The cDNA was labeled using Klenow-mediated incorporation of [Î±-33P]dATP. The hybridization signals were quantified densitometrically using ImageQuant 5.1 software. The genes were characterized if their expression changed 2-fold or more in TPA-treated cells. Eleven genes were identified by gene expression profiling for which expression was up- or down-regulated by TPA (Fig. 1 A). Nine genes were up-regulated and two genes were down-regulated by TPA (see TableI). Dss1 was induced 3.5-fold, and it was selected for further study. Dss1 expression was also verified in TPA-treated and untreated keratinocyte progenitor cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the result was consistent with the microarray experiment (i.e.2â3-fold increase in Dss1 expression in cells exposed to TPA).Table IDifferentially expressed genes in TPA-treated keratinocyte progenitor cellsGB1-aGenBankâ¢ accession number.Gene protein nameMicroarray-fold change1-b-Fold change represents genes differentially overexpressed and underexpressed in TPA-treated keratinocyte progenitor cells/TPA-untreated keratinocyte progenitor cells.A.

Open table in a new tab Previous studies demonstrated that chronic topical application of TPA to the skin of TgÂ·AC mice induces epidermal hyperplasia (30Hansen L.A. Tennant R.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1994; 9: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Dss1 expression was analyzed in hyperplastic skin in TgÂ·AC mice exposed to various doses of TPA, as described under âMaterials and Methods.â Dss1 expression increased in hyperplastic skin in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained previously for TPA-induced expression of PCNA (30Hansen L.A. Tennant R.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1994; 9: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The dose response and kinetics of TPA-induced transcriptional activation of Dss1 were investigated using JB6 Cl 41-5a preneoplastic epidermal cells. Cells were grown in 5% FBS/Eagle's MEM containing 0, 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 100 ng/ml TPA; viable cells were harvested at 18 h, and total RNA was prepared for Northern blot analysis. Fig. 2 B (a) shows that TPA inducedDss1 1.7-fold at 1.0 ng/ml, and maximal induction (â¼2-fold) was reached at 10â100 ng/ml TPA. A kinetic analysis at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, and 36 h after treatment with 10 ng/ml TPA showed that Dss1 was induced 2.5-fold 1 h after TPA treatment and reached a maximal level of 3â5-fold 12â18 h after treatment. Dss1 expression appeared to decrease slightly 8 h after treatment and began to decline from the maximal level 18 h after treatment (Fig. 2 B, b). Tissue distribution ofDss1 mRNA was examined in TgÂ·AC adult mice using Northern blot analysis. Dss1 mRNA was transcribed in adult mouse tissues includi"

Here, we report that skeletal muscle myoblasts and terminally differentiated myotubes are susceptible to RNA interference. We employed an approach in which dsRNA is generated by cellular transcription from plasmids containing long (1 kilobase) inverted DNA repeats of the target gene rather than using dsRNA synthesized in vitro. We show that gene silencing by this method is effective for endogenously expressed genes as well as for exogenous reporter genes. An analysis of the expression of several endogenous genes and exogenous reporters demonstrates that the silencing effect is specific for the target gene containing sequences within the inverted repeat. Our method eliminates the need to chemically synthesize dsRNA and is not accompanied by global repression of gene expression. Furthermore, we show for the first time that sequence-specific dsRNA-mediated gene silencing is possible in differentiated, multinucleated skeletal muscle myotubes. These findings provide an important molecular tool for the examination of protein function in terminally differentiated muscle cells and provide alternative approaches for generating disease models.

In the post-genomics era, efforts to understand the molecular basis of disease will be limited primarily by the ability to determine the function of proteins encoded by candidate disease genes and to evaluate novel drug targets. The ability to silence expression of specific genes is a powerful mechanism for analysis of gene function. Although targeted gene disruption via homologous recombination is possible in mammals, currently available strategies are costly and time-consuming. The generation of knock-out animal models may also be confounded by unanticipated splice variants that produce functional proteins, despite the removal of targeted exons (1Huang P.L. Dawson T.M. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Fishman M.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1273-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when embryonic lethality results from gene deletion (2Williamson R.A. Henry M.D. Daniels K.J. Hrstka R.F. Lee J.C. Sunada Y. Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Campbell K.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), it may be impossible to evaluate the role of a target protein in fully differentiated cells and adult tissues. Sequence-specific gene silencing initiated by the presence of aberrant RNA was first observed in plants containing inverted transgenes and referred to as post-transcriptional gene silencing (3Que Q. Jorgensen R.A. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 4Jorgensen R.A. Cluster P.D. English J. Que Q. Napoli C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 957-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). A similar gene silencing phenomenon was observed in Caenorhabditis elegans where insightful genetic studies demonstrate that silencing was mediated by double-stranded RNA and occurred at the level of mRNA abundance (5Montgomery M.K., Xu, S. Fire A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15502-15507Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 6Fire A., Xu, S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11892) Google Scholar). The term double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi)1 was coined to describe this RNA-mediated genetic interference. The use of RNAi to target specific mRNAs for degradation provides an alternative method for targeted gene silencing and has now been shown to function in a variety of organisms including nematodes, planaria, trypanosomes, hydra, zebrafish, and Drosophila (5Montgomery M.K., Xu, S.

Although the precise mechanism of RNAi is still unclear, the process has been heralded as revolutionary because of its specificity, catalytic features, and effectiveness in comparison with traditional sense or antisense knock-out technology (20Bosher J.M. Labouesse M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E31-E36Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Despite the broad species specificity of RNAi (16Hammond S.M. Caudy A.A. Hannon G.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), its utility for examining gene function in mammalian cells has remained somewhat dubious because of nonspecific repression of gene expression that is induced by cellular responses to cytoplasmic duplex RNA in many mammalian cell lines (21Clemens M.J.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). A major component of this response is presumed to be the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, which upon activation by dsRNA longer than 30 nucleotides, phosphorylates eIF-2Î±, leading to global down-regulation of protein translation (21Clemens M.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev.

These studies demonstrate that the machinery responsible for sequence-specific RNAi is present in these cells, although the magnitude of the specific decrease in target gene expression varies considerably depending upon the cell type examined and choice of target gene (23Elbashir S.M.

When the length of the dsRNA duplex exceeds â¼30 nucleotides, the specificity of dsRNA-induced gene silencing is lost and genes unrelated to the dsRNA duplex are also down-regulated (23Elbashir S.M.

Because of our interest in gene products involved in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy, we analyzed the efficacy of dsRNAi in cultured skeletal muscle myoblasts and myotubes.

Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8181) Google Scholar, 26Wianny F. Zernicka-Goetz M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 27Caplen N.J. Fleenor J. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In this study, we use an alternate approach of introducing plasmid DNA encoding inverted repeats of a target sequence into cultured murine muscle cells. This approach has been dramatically successful in other non-mammalian systems (13Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) and has recently been shown to be effective for RNAi in embryonic cell lines (28Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Hannon G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1443-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Using this method, we demonstrate that RNA interference is effective and specific in cultured mammalian muscle cells. A human dyxin expression construct was prepared by PCR amplification of the dyxin open reading frame (GenBankTM accession number AF216709) (29Bespalova I.N. Burmeister M. Genomics. 2000; 63: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using primers containing appropriate restriction sites for subcloning into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Amersham Biosciences) A human sarcospan expression construct was prepared by PCR amplification of the sarcospan open reading frame from a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) (31Crosbie R.H. Heighway J. Venzke D.P. Lee J.C. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31221-31224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Both the dyxin (pcDNA.dyxin) and the sarcospan (pcDNA.SSPN) constructs were engineered to encode a Myc tag at the COOH terminus followed by a stop codon. For dsRNA expression constructs, standard cloning methods were used to place oppositely oriented copies of the dyxin open reading frame at either end of theGFPmut3b gene (GenBankTM accession numberAF110459.1) (32Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). This construct was inserted into the multicloning site of pcDNA3 to generate pcDNA.dyxin.dsRNA with the 5â² copy of the dyxin gene oriented in the forward direction (Fig. 3). A similar dsRNA expression plasmid was engineered using inverted repeats of theGFPmut3b gene (nucleotides 1â714) (32Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). The sequences of all constructs were verified by direct DNA sequence analysis performed by the DNA Core Facility at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). C2C12 myoblasts, strain C3H (American Type Cell Culture, Manassas, VA) (33Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science. 1985; 230: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 34Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar), were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM, Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin C2C12 myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes by incubating in DMEM with 2% horse serum for 5â7 days as described previously (34Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells were trypsinized after reaching 90% confluency on a 150-mm plate and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline lacking CaCl2 and MgCl2 (1.4 mm NaCl, 0.27 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, and 0.18 mmdibasic phosphate, pH 7.4). Myoblasts were transfected with 5 Î¼g of plasmid DNA by electroporation (340 V at 950 microfarads) in 1-cm electroporation cuvettes and electroporated with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Time constants ranged from 16 to 17 ms. Immediately after electroporation, cells were resuspended in complete medium and plated in 35-mm culture plates as described previously (35Crosbie R.H. Lebakken C.S. Holt K.H. Venzke D.P. Straub V. Lee J.C. Grady R.M. Chamberlain J.S. Sanes J.R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Clonfectin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was diluted to 1 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES-NaCl-buffered saline, and 5 Î¼g was combined with 5 Î¼g of plasmid DNA in serum-free DMEM. The liposome plus DNA mixture was incubated for 30 min and then added to myotubes grown on a 35-mm culture dish with 2 ml of serum- free DMEM. Myotubes were treated with the Clonfectin solution for 2 h at 37 Â°C, 5% CO2. After transfection, the medium was aspirated and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to grow in fresh complete DMEM. To quantitate transfection efficiency, myotubes were transfected with pEGFP-C3 plasmid (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which encodes green fluorescent protein (GFP). Myotubes were viewed under a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted fluorescence microscope. Percent transfection efficiency was determined by counting the number of GFP-positive cells relative to total cell number. Under these conditions, over 85% transfection efficiency was routinely achieved. For protein lysates, myoblasts, and myotubes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (300 Î¼l of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 300 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.2 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.75 mm benzamidine, 0.5 Î¼g/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 Î¼g/ml leupeptin). Protein samples (30 Î¼g/lane) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membrane (Immobilin-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described previously (35Crosbie R.H. Lebakken C.S. Holt K.H. Venzke D.P. Straub V. Lee J.C. Grady R.M. Chamberlain J.S. Sanes J.R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To detect heterologous Myc-tagged proteins, immunoblots were probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies to the Myc tag (9E10, 1:1000 dilution, Sigma). For dyxin immunoblotting, membranes were probed with affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (rabbit 2, 1:500 dilution) generated against a COOH-terminal peptide-(KGQLLCPTCSKSKRS). The monoclonal antibody E7 directed against Î²-tubulin was developed previously (30Chu D.T. Klymkowsky M.W. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). E7 supernatant was used at a 1:5000 dilution to detect Î²-tubulin on immunoblots. Antibodies to vinculin (1:250, Sigma) and eIF-2Î± (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were used for immunoblotting as indicated by the manufacturer. Following incubation with the primary antibodies, blots were probed with either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences) and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce, Rockford, IL). Total RNA was isolated from transfected C2C12 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (2 Î¼g) was fractionated by formaldehyde gel and subjected to Northern blot analysis using probes, representing the full-length dyxin, Î²-actin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Inherited muscle disease provides an excellent example of a field where the identification of candidate disease genes is outpacing efforts to understand function of the corresponding gene products. We investigated whether RNAi could be used for sequence-specific gene silencing in muscle cells as a method for analysis of gene function. As a target gene, we chose a novel âLIM and cysteine-rich domainâ gene (LMCD1) (29Bespalova I.N. Burmeister M. Genomics. 2000; 63: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number NM014583), also known as dyxin (GenBankTMAF216709). Dyxin has two tandem LIM domains in its COOH-terminal region and is highly expressed in skeletal muscle (29Bespalova I.N. Burmeister M. Genomics. 2000; 63: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although the precise function of dyxin is unknown, it is postulated to be involved in DNA-protein interactions during skeletal muscle development (29Bespalova I.N. Burmeister M. Genomics. 2000; 63: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As a model system, we employed C2C12 cells, a well established murine skeletal muscle cell line (33Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science. 1985; 230: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). C2C12 cells can be maintained in culture as undifferentiated myoblasts or can be induced to fuse and assemble into terminally differentiated, multinucleated myotubes in low mitogen medium (33Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science. 1985; 230: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of whole cell lysates from C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes were probed with affinity-purified anti-dyxin polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, dyxin is expressed in mature differentiated myotubes but not in myoblasts. Thus, by employing both myoblasts and myotubes, we are able to assess the utility of RNAi for silencing the expression of exogenous reporter genes (recombinant dyxin in myoblasts) as well as endogenously expressed genes (dyxin in myotubes). To demonstrate that exogenous dyxin expression is possible in myoblasts, a Myc-tagged human dyxin cDNA plasmid (pcDNA.dyxin) was introduced into C2C12 myoblasts by electroporation. Immunoblots of protein lysates from transfected C2C12 cells were stained with either anti-dyxin antibodies (Fig. 2) or monoclonal antibodies to the Myc tag (data not shown). Dyxin protein was not detected in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2, lane 1) but is expressed at high levels 30 h post-transfection with pcDNA.dyxin (Fig. 2, lane 2). Previous efforts to use RNAi for sequence-specific gene silencing in cultured mammalian cells have primarily employed dsRNA molecules that were produced and annealed in vitro and then introduced into the cytoplasm of cultured cells by injection or liposome-mediated transfection (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8181) Google Scholar, 24Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9742-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 26Wianny F. Zernicka-Goetz M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). When the length of the synthetic dsRNA exceeds 30 bp, the target cells are found to exhibit a generalized suppression of gene expression (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8181) Google Scholar, 24Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9742-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). This nonspecific inhibition of gene expression is presumed to result from interferon-response pathways that are activated by the presence of dsRNA injected into the cytoplasm, a process that may mimic the response of the cell to viral dsRNA (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8181) Google Scholar, 24Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9742-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 36Clemens M.J. Elia A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In this study, we employed an alternative strategy in which the cell's own transcription machinery transcribes inverted DNA repeats, producing dsRNA within the cell. For these experiments, we generated a dyxin dsRNA expression vector (pcDNA.dyxin.dsRNA) containing inverted copies of a 1-kilobase portion of the dyxin open reading frame separated by 700 bp of nonspecific âspacerâ DNA (Fig. 3). To test the efficacy of RNAi on exogenous dyxin expression, C2C12 myoblasts were co-transfected with pcDNA.dyxin together with pcDNA.dyxin.dsRNA. Whole cell lysates were assayed for dyxin expression by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). These experiments demonstrate that exogenous dyxin expression is blocked by expression of the dyxin dsRNA construct. The specificity of this gene silencing was tested using three separate approaches. First, the expression of several endogenous genes was examined in cells transfected with pcDNA.dyxin.dsRNA. As shown in Fig. 2, dyxin dsRNA has no effect on the expression of Î²-tubulin, vinculin, or eIF-2Î±. Therefore, gene silencing is specific for the target gene. We next asked whether dyxin expression was affected by a non-homologous dsRNA construct. For this purpose, we constructed a plasmid (pcDNA.GFP.dsRNA) containing inverted repeats of the GFP open reading frame. Dyxin remains abundantly expressed in myoblasts co-transfected with pcDNA.dyxin and pcDNA.GFP.dsRNA (Fig. 2, lane 5), demonstrating that GFP dsRNA has no effect on exogenous dyxin expression. As shown earlier for dyxin dsRNA, GFP dsRNA also has no effect on endogenous expression of Î²-tubulin, vinculin, or eIF-2Î± (Fig. 2, lane 5). As an additional test of the specificity of RNAi in myoblasts, we examined the effect of dyxin dsRNA on the expression of another exogenous reporter gene. As a reporter gene, we used sarcospan (SSPN), a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (31Crosbie R.H. Heighway J. Venzke D.P. Lee J.C. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31221-31224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 35Crosbie R.H. Lebakken C.S. Holt K.H. Venzke D.P. Straub V. Lee J.C. Grady R.M. Chamberlain J.S. Sanes J.R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 37Crosbie R.H. Lim L.E. Moore S.A. Hirano M. Hays A.P. Maybaum S.W. Collin H. Dovico S.A. Stolle C.A. Fardeau M. Tome F.M. Campbell K.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myoblasts do not normally express SSPN (data not shown), but cells transfected with a sarcospan cDNA express high levels of sarcospan protein (Fig. 4, lane 1). Expression of sarcospan was not affected by co-expression of dyxin.dsRNA (Fig. 4, lane 2). A key feature of RNA interference is that it exerts its effect at the post-transcriptional level by destruction of targeted mRNA (for review see Ref. 16Hammond S.M. Caudy A.A. Hannon G.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). To test whether the loss of dyxin protein occurred at the level of mRNA abundance, we analyzed dyxin mRNA levels by Northern blotting. Total RNA was prepared from the samples analyzed previously for dyxin protein expression. Northern blots were probed with a full-length dyxin cDNA probe. As shown in Fig. 5, a 1.35-kilobase dyxin transcript is expressed in C2C12 myoblasts transfected with pcDNA.dyxin, but this dyxin mRNA is dramatically reduced in myoblasts co-transfected with pcDNA.dyxin and pcDNA.dyxin.dsRNA (Fig. 5, lane 4). As a control for specificity, dyxin mRNA levels are not affected by co-transfection with a non-homologous dsRNA construct (pcDNA.GFP.dsRNA) (Fig. 5, lane 5). Northern blots hybridized with probes for Î²-actin (Fig. 5, lower panel) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (data not shown) further demonstrate that silencing is specific for dyxin. The ability to silence specific genes in mammalian cells holds great promise for uncovering the function of proteins that are known to be defective in certain inherited diseases. However, many disease genes are expressed only in terminally differentiated cells and tissues. For example, components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex are required for normal muscle function and prevention of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (38Allamand V. Campbell K.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) but are expressed only upon differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes (39Belkin A.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6328-6337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine whether RNAi can be used for sequence-specific gene silencing in differentiated mammalian cells, we induced the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into skeletal muscle myotubes in culture. Myotubes possess fully functional sarcomeres, exhibit contractile properties in culture, and are important models for mammalian skeletal muscle physiology (33Blau H.M. Pavlath G.K. Hardeman E.C. Chiu C.P. Silberstein L. Webster S.G. Miller S.C. Webster C. Science. 1985; 230: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). We introduced the dyxin dsRNA expression vector (pcDNA.dyxin.dsRNA) into myotubes by liposome-mediated transfection. Whole myotube protein lysates were analyzed at 0, 12, and 24 h post-transfection by Western blotting with affinity-purified anti-dyxin antibodies (Fig. 6). Endogenous dyxin expression in myotubes was completely abolished 12 and 24 h after transfection with the dyxin dsRNA expression vector (Fig. 6). Dyxin levels were constant for all mock-treated samples (Fig. 3) (data not shown). As is the case for myoblasts, dyxin.dsRNA-mediated gene silencing is specific to dyxin because Î²-tubulin, vinculin, and eIF-2Î± expression remained constant in all samples (Fig. 6) (data not shown). Skeletal muscle fibers are specialized multinucleated cells with well organized contractile filaments. Investigating the function of muscle-specific gene products is complicated by the limitations of traditional cell lines, which lack the contractile apparatus and therefore lack many muscle-specific proteins. Although cultured myotubes provide an excellent model for studying skeletal muscle physiology, the lack of a method to easily eliminate gene expression in these cells has restricted in vivo analysis of protein function. RNAi offers a number of advantages over gene disruption, because it is rapid, potent, and can be achieved with a fraction of the effort required for generating knock-out animal models. Recent ground-breaking experiments have demonstrated that sequence-specific RNAi is feasible in certain types of undifferentiated cultured mammalian cells using chemically synthesized or in vitrogenerated duplex RNAs (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8181) Google Scholar, 26Wianny F. Zernicka-Goetz M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 27Caplen N.J. Fleenor J. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 252: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 40Ui-Tei K. Zenno S. Miyata Y. Saigo K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To extend these studies to terminally differentiated myofibers, we tested a method whereby plasmid DNA containing large inverted repeats of a target mRNA is introduced into myoblasts and myotubes. In this way, dsRNA is generated intracellularly by transcription from the expression vector. We demonstrate that gene silencing induced by this method results in a loss of target gene expression without perturbing overall gene expression. Importantly, we show that the target mRNA can be an endogenous transcript or an exogenous reporter gene and that the loss of the target mRNA is correlated with concomitant loss of target protein. Only the target gene is affected, and inverted repeats containing non-relevant sequences have no effect on target gene expression. In addition, we demonstrate that gene silencing by this approach is effective in mature differentiated skeletal muscle myotubes. Although the mechanism of dsRNA-mediated gene silencing observed here in mammalian muscle cells remains to be determined, several lines of evidence suggest that this is occurring through a phenomenon mechanistically related to RNA interference pathways that have been characterized in C. elegans, Drosophila, and other systems (16Hammond S.M. Caudy A.A. Hannon G.J. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). First, the loss of target gene expression is not accompanied by global down-regulation of protein synthesis. Second, target gene silencing is sequence-specific, because non-homologous dsRNA does not interfere with target gene expression. Third, silencing of the target gene occurs at the level of mRNA abundance. Importantly, the ability to silence endogenously expressed genes demonstrates the utility of this approach for examining the function of proteins that are only expressed in differentiated muscle cells. Recent work from several laboratories indicates that the effectiveness of long dsRNA for inducing sequence-specific RNAi in cultured mammalian cells varies from cell type to cell type (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8181) Google Scholar, 26Wianny F. Zernicka-Goetz M. Nat.

During preparation of this paper, Paddison and colleagues (28Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Hannon G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1443-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) report using a 500-nucleotide synthetic luciferase dsRNA to knockdown expression of an exogenous reporter gene (firefly luciferase) in murine myoblasts. Our results compliment and extend this work by demonstrating potent and sequence-specific silencing of endogenous gene expression in both myoblasts and myotubes. Together, these results suggest that murine myoblasts and myotubes may be more susceptible to sequence-specific RNAi than other mammalian cell types thus far tested as has been previously been reported for embryonic cell lines (28Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Hannon G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1443-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We have shown that double-stranded RNA-induced gene silencing is possible in terminally differentiated muscle cell lines. This represents the first example of dsRNA-induced gene silencing in terminally differentiated mammalian cells and demonstrates that the target gene can be an endogenous transcript that is expressed only upon cellular differentiation. These findings provide an alternative to traditional gene âknock-outâ studies for generating models of inherited muscle disease. It has recently been reported that RNAi induced by short synthetic-interfering RNA duplexes (siRNA) can be used to knockdown expression of several endogenous genes in mammalian cell lines (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8181) Google Scholar, 24Caplen N.J. Parrish S. Imani F. Fire A. Morgan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4557-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies extend these findings by demonstrating that sequence-specific dsRNA-mediated gene silencing can be used for functional analysis of muscle gene products within the context of a biologically relevant cell culture model for mammalian muscle. With advances in gene-silencing techniques, diseases that are caused by genetic mutations leading to loss of protein expression (i.e. recessive muscular dystrophies) can be investigated with greater ease.

https://openalex.org/W2040730041,"Previous photolabeling and limited proteolysis studies suggested that one of the four basic residues (Arg-141) of the N-terminal cytoplasmic loop connecting helices IV and V (loop 4â5) of the melibiose permease (MelB) from Escherichia coli has a potential role in its symport function (Ambroise, Y., Leblanc, G., and Rousseau, B. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 1338â1345). A mutagenesis study of Arg-141 and of the other three basic residues of loop 4â5 was undertaken to further examine this hypothesis. Cys replacement analysis indicated that Arg-141 and Arg-149, but not Lys-138 and Arg-139, are essential for MelB transport activity. Replacement of Arg-141 by neutral residues (Cys or Gln) inactivated transport and energy-independent carrier-mediated flows of substrates (counterflow, efflux), whereas it had a limited effect on co-substrate binding. R141C sugar transport was partially rescued on reintroducing a positive charge with a charged and permeant thiol reagent. Whereas R149C was completely inactive, R149K and R149Q remained functional. Strikingly, introduction of an additional mutation in the C-terminal helix X (Gly for Val-343) of R149C restored sugar transport. Impermeant thiol reagents inhibited R149C/V343G transport activity in right-side-out membrane vesicles and prevented sugar binding in a sugar-protected manner. All these data suggest that MelB loop 4â5 is close to the sugar binding site and that the charged residue Arg-141 is involved in the reaction of co-substrate translocation or substrate release in the inner compartment. Previous photolabeling and limited proteolysis studies suggested that one of the four basic residues (Arg-141) of the N-terminal cytoplasmic loop connecting helices IV and V (loop 4â5) of the melibiose permease (MelB) from Escherichia coli has a potential role in its symport function (Ambroise, Y., Leblanc, G., and Rousseau, B.

All these data suggest that MelB loop 4â5 is close to the sugar binding site and that the charged residue Arg-141 is involved in the reaction of co-substrate translocation or substrate release in the inner compartment. melibiose permease, (6-O-Î±-d-galactopyranosyl-d-glucose) methyl-1-thio-Î²-galactopyranoside p-nitrophenyl Î±-d-6-galactopyranoside fluorescence resonance energy transfer 2â²-(N-dansyl)aminoethyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside (2-aminoethyl)methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl) methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide p-chloromercury benzoic acid right-side-out membranes The melibiose permease (MelB)1 of Escherichia coli is a membrane-bound ion-coupled sugar co-transporter or symporter that drives cell accumulation of Î±-galactosides (melibiose, raffinose) or Î²-galactosides (methyl-1-thio-Î²-galactopyranoside (TMG)) using a favorable electrochemical potential gradient for Na+, Li+, or H+ (1Tsuchiya T.

A recombinant transporter bearing a His6 tag (Mel-His6 permease) can be purified in large amounts and exhibits ion-dependent sugar binding and transport properties similar to MelB in its native environment once reconstituted in artificial lipid membranes (9Pourcher T.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4846-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, two-dimensional crystallization of Mel-His6 permease was achieved, and a projection map at 8 â« resolution was derived by electron crystallography (12Hacksell I. Rigaud J.L. Purhonen P. Pourcher T. Hebert H. Leblanc G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3569-3574Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The projection map suggests an asymmetric protein unit hosting 12 potential transmembrane Î±-helices that are distributed in two domains lining a central and curve-shaped cleft. Na+ and melibiose are transported in a 1:1 ratio, and their order of binding to MelB at the outer surface (Na+ first) and release in the inner compartment (Na+ last) are sequential (13Damiano-Forano E. Bassilana M. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6893-6899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane potential enhances active Na+-coupled sugar transport by increasing the rate of Na+ dissociation in the cytoplasm, which is otherwise slow and rate-limiting for MelB turnover (see review, Ref. 3Pourcher T.

Cooperative changes in MelB conformation upon substrate binding were inferred from the analysis of the intrinsic fluorescence of MelB and by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy (FRET) with a fluorescent sugar analog (10Mus-Veteau I.

Complementary evidence came from the finding that MelB substrates afford a cooperative protection against proteolysis of the highly charged cytoplasmic loop 4â5 connecting helices IV and V of MelB (7Gwizdek C. Leblanc G. Bassilana M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Molecular biology, biochemical, and spectroscopic approaches have been extensively used to collect information on the functional organization of the transporter. This organization involves the presence of a potential coordination network for the cation recognition and coupling mechanism, including four aspartic acid residues distributed in the inner halves of helices I (Asp-19), II (Asp-55 and Asp-59), and IV (Asp-124) of the N-terminal hydrophobic domain of MelB (6Poolman B.

Analysis of the properties of second-site suppressor mutants supports the hypothesis of a proximity between the three N-terminal helices (19Franco P.J. Wilson T.H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6377-6386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Ding P.Z. Wilson T.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5506-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Extensive Cys-scanning mutagenesis of residues of membrane domains combined with chemical modifications of MelB with impermeant thiol reagents or with second-site mutation analysis has been used to identify sectors of given membrane domains facing the co-substrate pathway. They also suggest proximity between helices I, II, IV, VII, X, and XI (see Ref. 20Ding P.Z. Wilson T.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5506-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and references therein). To date, most of the previous analyses focused on the membrane domains of MelB. However, few reports have already pointed out a possible functional implication of cytoplasmic loop 10â11 connecting helices X and XI (3Pourcher T. Bassilana M. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Leblanc G.

In addition, two other observations suggested that the cytoplasmic loop connecting helices IV and V (loop 4â5) might also be important for MelB function (see Fig. 1). The first one showed that the arginyl residue Arg-141 of loop 4â5 is a melibiose-protected site of MelB labeling by a photoactivable azido phenyl sugar analog (24Ambroise Y. Leblanc G. Rousseau B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1338-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The other one indicated that Arg-141 is part of one of the two trypsin cleavage targets in this loop 4â5 that are cooperatively protected against protease attack in the presence of the physiological substrates (Na+ + melibiose > Na+ â« melibiose) (7Gwizdek C. Leblanc G. Bassilana M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of Arg-141 and loop 4â5, we analyzed the functional consequences of replacing Arg-141 by different residues (Cys, Lys, Gln) and compared them with the effects produced by the mutagenesis of the three other basic residues of this loop (Lys-138, Arg-139, and Arg-149). Complementary information was obtained by reacting the newly introduced Cys residues with methanethiosulfonate derivatives (25Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and isolation of second-site suppressor mutants. The obtained data suggest that the cytoplasmic loop 4â5 of MelB is close to the sugar binding site and may participate directly in co-substrate translocation by MelB. Synthesis and labeling ofp-nitrophenyl Î±-d-6-[3H]galactopyranoside (Î±-[3H]NPG) or 6-O-Î±-d-[3H]galactopyranosyl-d-glucose and synthesis of the fluorescent sugar analog (Dns2-S-Gal) were carried out by Dr. B. Rousseau and Y. Ambroise (DeÌpartement de Biologie Joliot Curie/CEA-Saclay, France). [14C]TMG was from Isotopchim (France). The methanethiosulfonate derivative reagents (MTSEA+, MTSET+) were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. Stock solutions (0.2â0.5m) were prepared in distilled water, stored in the frozen state, and used immediately after thawing. Stock solutions ofN-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) were prepared at 0.2 min ethanol. E. coli DW2-R, a Rec Aâ derivative of strain DW2 (ÎmelB ÎlacZY), was transformed with the given plasmids (9Pourcher T. Leclercq S. Brandolin G. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4412-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Freshly transformed cells were grown at 30 Â°C in M9 medium supplemented with glycerol (0.5 g/liter) and casamino acids (0.2%) as the carbon source, thiamine (0.5 mg/ml), and ampicillin (100 Î¼g/ml) until anA 600 of 1â1.2 was reached. Cells were then washed and resuspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7). A recombinant pK95ÎAHB plasmid with a cassette containing themelB gene (9Pourcher T. Leclercq S. Brandolin G. Leblanc G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4412-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) encoding a permease devoid of its four native cysteine (C-less MelB) was constructed with the appropriate mutagenesis primers and subsequently used for control experiments or for permease engineering. This C-less carrier displayed a valine instead of Cys-235 and a serine instead of Cys-110, Cys-310, and Cys-364 (26Weissborn A.C. Botfield M.C. Kuroda M. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Individual Cys replacements were engineered by polymerase chain reactions using the appropriate primers (27â30 nucleotides, Genosys) and the recombinant plasmid harboring the C-less carrier melB gene as a matrix. Plasmids were isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). Sequencing was performed using 35S-labeled dATP with the sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Right-side-out (RSO) membrane vesicles prepared by an osmotic shock procedure as described (2Bassilana M. Damiano-Forano E. Leblanc G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were concentrated to 2 mg of protein/ml and equilibrated in a medium containing 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7) lacking NaCl (<20 Î¼m). Freshly grown cells were concentrated to 2 mg of protein/ml in a 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7) medium that contained NaCl at a final concentration lower than 20 Î¼m. H+-coupled sugar transport was assayed in this medium by adding either [3H]melibiose (20 mCi/mmol) or [14C]TMG (3 mCi/mmol) at a final concentration of 0.4 or 0.8 mm. The assay was stopped after the given times by diluting and immediate filtration of the samples using glass fiber filters (7Gwizdek C. Leblanc G. Bassilana M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When Na+- or Li+-dependent sugar transport was measured, NaCl or LiCl was added at a final concentration of 10 mmjust before the addition of the radioactive substrates. Transport in RSO membrane vesicles was assayed by a similar procedure except for the presence of reduced phenazine methosulfate as an energy donor (2Bassilana M. Damiano-Forano E. Leblanc G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The radioactivity retained on the filters was counted in a Packard scintillation counter. RSO membrane vesicles (20 mg/ml) were previously loaded with 30 mm melibiose for 12 h at 4 Â°C. 2-Î¼l aliquots of sugar-loaded vesicles were diluted 100-fold in a buffer containing [3H]melibiose at a concentration of 0.1 mm (40 mCi/mmol). The extra-vesicular unlabeled sugar present in the membrane aliquots raised the final concentration of sugar of the diluting medium to 0.4 mm (10 mCi/mmol). The intra-vesicular accumulation of radioactivity was terminated at the given times by a dilution/filtration procedure similar to that used for transport assays. Î±-[3H]NPG binding to RSO membrane vesicles was assessed by a flow dialysis procedure as described in Damiano-Forano et al. (13Damiano-Forano E. Bassilana M. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6893-6899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RSO membrane vesicle suspensions (10â20 mg/ml) were initially equilibrated with Î±-[3H]NPG (0.8 mCi/mmol), and the medium NPG concentration was varied between 0.1 and 10 Î¼m by the stepwise addition of unlabeled ligand. The maximal number of binding sites (B max) and apparent binding constant (K D) were calculated graphically from Scatchard plots of the data. The activation constant for NPG binding by Na+ (K Na) was determined using plots of the apparent K D values for NPG as a function of the reciprocal concentration of sodium chloride in the range of 0.1â10 mm. Melibiose inhibitory constants (K i) were estimated by progressive displacement of bound Î±-[3H]NPG (0.8 mCi/mmol, 1 Î¼m) by stepwise addition of sugar (0.5â20 mm). TheseK i values were used to calculate the melibiose binding constants (K D) (27Rossi B. Vuilleumier P. Gache C. Balerna M. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9936-9941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples containing solubilized RSO membrane protein (â¼20 Î¼g) were subjected to SDS, 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The electroblotted proteins were probed with a mouse anti-C-terminal MelB antibody followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (7Gwizdek C. Leblanc G. Bassilana M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Results were expressed as percent of the signal recorded from membranes carrying the Cys-less permease (0.4â0.6 nmol/mg of protein, see Table I). Cell or membrane protein was estimated by a modified Folin procedure, with bovine serum albumin as a standard.Table INPG binding constants of the C-less permease, of the permease carrying different substitutions at position 141 or 149, and of the second-site revertant R149C/V343GMutantLocationB max (nmoles/mg protein)K DK NaÎ¼mmmC-less0.60.60.6R141C0.22.50.1â0.5R141KLoop 4â50.21.70.3R141Q0.33.10.3R149CNSNSNSR149KLoop 4â50.37.70.3R149Q0.37.30.4R149C/V343GLoop 4â5/TM X0.21.70.2V343GTM X0.34.41.6All RSO membrane vesicles harboring the C-less or MelB mutants were prepared and concentrated (15â25 mg of protein/ml) in Naâ-free, 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (5 Î¼m) and monensin (0.75 Î¼m) as described in the Fig. 3 legend. Î±-[3H]NPG binding was assayed in a flow dialysis cell as described in Damiano-Forano et al.(13Damiano-Forano E. Bassilana M. Leblanc G. J. Biol.

The maximal number of binding sites (B max) and apparent NPG binding constant (K D) were calculated graphically from Scatchard plots of the data. The activation constant for NPG binding by Na+ (K Na) was determined from plots of the apparent K D for NPG as a function of the reciprocal concentration of sodium chloride in the range of 0.1â10 mm.

A LS 50 PerkinElmer fluorometer was used to measure the Na+-dependent FRET signals (Eex, 297 Â± 5 nm; Eemmax, 465â475 Â± 5 nm) arising from RSO membrane vesicles (100 Î¼g of protein/ml) incubated in the presence of the sugar fluorescent analog Dns2-S-Gal at a final concentration of 10 Î¼m (14Maehrel C. Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A strategy developed by Ding and Wilson was used (28Ding P.Z. Wilson T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, DW2-R-melA+ cells expressing R149C permease grew initially as white colonies on 1% melibiose MacConkey agar plates (Difco). After 3â5 days incubation at 37 Â°C, small red areas appeared and were picked and re-streaked for colony purification. After isolation of the plasmid DNA, mutations responsible for fermentation recovery were identified by sequencing the entire gene using primers annealing at about 250-bp intervals. Throughout this study the C-less MelB permease retaining a wild-type transport phenotype was used as control (see Fig. 2, Table I, and Ref. 26Weissborn A.C. Botfield M.C. Kuroda M. Tsuchiya T. Wilson T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of individual replacements of each four positively charged residues of loop 4â5 by a cysteine was assessed by measuring Na+-dependent [3H]melibiose accumulation in E. coliDW2-R cells expressing each mutant. Fig. 2 A shows that K138C and R139C cells accumulated [3H]melibiose in 10 min to an extent close to or higher than C-less MelB cells. Western blot analysis suggested that the difference in transport could be accounted for by variation of the cell membrane permease contents (R139C > C-less MelB > K138C, data not shown). The sugar (melibiose, TMG) and ionic selectivity profiles (Na+, Li+, or H+) of K138C and R139C permeases were similar to that of C-less MelB (data not shown). In contrast, neither R141C nor R149C permeases catalyzed significant cell accumulation of melibiose (Fig. 2 A) or of TMG (data not shown). Because R141C and R149C membrane permease contents were 65 and 74% that of C-less MelB membrane, respectively (Fig. 2 B), these two mutants must have a catalytic defect. To assess more precisely the catalytic defect(s) of R141C and R149C permeases, their Na+-dependent sugar binding activity was measured in RSO membrane vesicles using the high affinity radiolabeled sugar analog Î±-[3H]NPG as a ligand (13Damiano-Forano E. Bassilana M. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6893-6899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The upper curve in Fig. 3 A illustrates typical binding variations recorded from de-energized C-less MelB membrane vesicles. The drop of free Î±-[3H]NPG concentration observed on adding NaCl (20 mm) reflects enhanced Î±-[3H]NPG binding to C-less MelB membranes, whereas the subsequent rise occurring upon the addition of unlabeled NPG in excess (250 Î¼m) was due to the release of bound ligand (upper curve). Fig. 3 A also shows that R141C membranes retained Na+-dependent NPG binding activity (middle curve), whereas R149C membranes did not (lower curve), even when the NaCl concentration was raised up to 1 m (data not shown). Additional binding experiments indicated that R141C permease had at most 3â4 times less affinity for Î±-[3H]NPG (K D, Table I) or for melibiose (2 mm instead of 0.6 mm, not shown) than C-less permease. In contrast, no significant change in activation of sugar binding to the two mutants by sodium was observed (K Na, Table I). FRET spectroscopy of RSO membrane vesicles incubated in the presence of Î²-galactoside fluorescent analog Dns2-S-Gal provides the means to assess ion-induced structural changes of MelB and related variation of the sugar binding site microenvironment (14Maehrel C. Cordat E. Mus-Veteau I. Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33192-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The specific Na+-induced, tryptophan-mediated fluorescence signal (Emax at 465 nm) recorded from C-less MelB membrane vesicles excited at 297 Â± 5 nm (upper spectrum, Fig. 3 B) was similar to that previously recorded for wild-type MelB membrane vesicles. More interesting, R141C permease retained comparable Na+-dependent FRET signal (middle spectrum), indicating that Na+ ions still induced a cooperative modification of the sugar binding site structure in this mutant. In contrast, no significant FRET signal was recorded from R149C membranes (lower spectrum). From all these data, we conclude that the R141C mutation introduces a defect in the transport cycle at a step that follows co-substrate binding, whereas the R149C mutation directly impairs sugar binding. Entrance counterflow is an experimental assay where a very large increase in inward movement of radioactive sugar can be triggered by diluting de-energized RSO membrane vesicles loaded with unlabeled sugar (30 mm) into a medium containing labeled sugar at 0.4 mm. It is accepted that the influx of the labeled substrate during the initial phase of the trans-stimulation process is primarily associated to shuttling of the loaded ternary complex (MelB-ion-sugar) across the membrane and does not include contribution of the empty carrier (3Pourcher T. Bassilana M. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Leblanc G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Kaback H.R. Sahin-Toth M. Weinglass A.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A transient uptake of [3H]melibiose with a peak at about 1 min was observed in control C-less MelB membranes (Fig. 4 A) but not in R141C vesicles. In addition, downhill efflux of [3H]melibiose from sugar-loaded R141C membrane vesicles was completely inhibited (data not shown). All these data can be explained assuming an impaired reorientation of the loaded R141C carrier or sugar release and probably also sugar binding at the cytoplasmic surface. Chemical modification of single-Cys mutant with positively charged methanethiosulfonate derivatives (25Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) provides means to incorporate a positive charge at the Cys position in the mutants. Fig. 4 illustrates the effect of MTSEA+ or MTSET+ derivatives on the activity of R141C RSO membrane vesicles. Significant rescue of active transport (Fig. 4B), melibiose counterflow (Fig. 4 A), or efflux (data not shown) was observed on reacting R141C vesicles with MTSEA+ (1 mm) but not with MTSET+(1 mm). The selective reactivation of R141C permease by the permeant MTS reagent added externally to RSO membrane vesicles is readily explained by first taking into account that MTSEA+traverses the E. coli membrane much more efficiently than MTSET+ at the concentration of 1 mm used here (30Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and, second, that the thiol-reagent must cross the membrane to react with Arg-141 exposed to the cytoplasmic medium (7Gwizdek C. Leblanc G. Bassilana M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8522-8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Analysis of R141K or R141Q permeases brought additional insights into the mechanism by which this charged arginine residue might be involved in MelB function. Fig. 5 and Table Iindicate that R141Q behaved as R141C. Thus, R141Q failed to catalyze H+-, Na+-, or Li+-coupled transport of [3H]melibiose or [14C]TMG (Fig 5). However the mutant still bound Î±-[3H]NPG in a Na+-dependent fashion (Table I). Consistently, R141Q membranes displayed Na+-dependent FRET signal similar to that of R141C (data not shown) and no longer catalyzed carrier-mediated movements of sugar (counterflow, efflux, data not shown). The data in Table I and Fig. 5 also show that R141K permease retained ion-coupled melibiose or TMG transport and Na+-dependent NPG binding activity. However, it is worth noting that all Arg-141 substitutions led to limited reduction of sugar affinity (3â4-fold) in comparison to C-less MelB (TableI). All attempts to rescue R149C sugar binding or transport by reacting the mutant with either MTSEA+ or MTSET+ failed (see Fig. 6 A). The strong aggregation tendency of purified R149C precluded any study of its accessibility to the SH reagents by currently available labeling procedures implying affinity purification of the permease. Analysis of R149K and R149Q were more instructive. Fig. 5 indeed shows that cells expressing the two last mutants catalyzed significant Na+-dependent [3H]melibiose accumulation. The positive charge of Arg-149 is, therefore, not an absolute requirement for active transport. However, some of the R149Q and R149K properties were significantly different from those of C-less MelB. Thus, although R149Q and R149K affinity for the coupling Na+ ions was not significantly modified (Fig. 5 and TableI), their affinity for Î±-galactosides was severely reduced (about 10-fo"

A., Bougioukou, D., Turner, N. J., and Flitsch, S. L. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 12565â12572). The native structure of OCH has been solved at 2.0-â« resolution with selenomethionine multiple wave anomalous dispersion and refined to a final Rfree of 19.0. The structure of OCH consists of a dimer of trimers that resembles the âparentâ enzyme of the superfamily, enoyl-CoA hydratase. In contrast to enoyl-CoA hydratase, however, two octahedrally coordinated sodium atoms are found at the 3-fold axis of the hexamer of OCH, and the C-terminal helix of OCH does not form a discrete domain. Models of the substrate, 6-oxo camphor, and a proposed enolate intermediate in the putative active site suggest possible mechanistic roles for Glu-244, Asp-154, His-122, His-45, and His-145. 6-Oxo camphor hydrolase (OCH) is an enzyme of the crotonase superfamily that catalyzes carbon-carbon bond cleavage in bicyclic Î²-diketones via aretro-Claisen reaction (Grogan, G., Roberts, G.

Much of this work has been stimulated by the adoption of the hydroxylating enzyme cytochrome P450cam from Pseudomonas putida as a structural and mechanistic model for the activity of cytochromes P450 in general (1Lewis D.F.V. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Function and Mechanism. Taylor and Francis, Ltd., United Kingdom1996Google Scholar). In addition, microbial enzymes fromP. putida involved in the degradation of camphor, including cytochrome P450cam, have been exploited as biocatalysts for asymmetric oxidation reactions in synthetic chemistry (2Fowler, S. M., England, P. A., Westlake, A. C. G., Rouch, D. R., Nickerson, D. P., Blunt, C., Braybrook, D., West, S., Wong, L.-L., and Flitsch, S. L. (1994) J. Chem. Soc. Chem.

The metabolism of (1R)-(+)-camphor 1 (Fig. 1) by P. putida proceeds via hydroxylation in the 5-exo position to give hydroxyketone2, followed by oxidation to diketone 3, which is oxidatively cleaved by an enzymatic Baeyer-Villiger reactionvia lactone 4 (3Bradshaw W.H.

Our interests in preparative synthetic biocatalysis led us to isolate OCH and to apply it to the asymmetric cleavage of a number of native substrate analogues (5Grogan G. Graf J. Jones A. Parsons S.

Analysis of the primary structure of OCH showed it to have significant homology to the crotonase superfamily of enzymes.Figure 2Carbon-carbon bond cleavage reaction catalyzed by OCH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The crotonase superfamily of proteins is a group of low sequence homology enzymes that catalyze a wide range of biochemical reactions (7Holden H.M. Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The parent enzyme of the superfamily, enoyl-coenzyme A hydratase (ECH) catalyzes the stereospecific hydration of enoyl-coenzyme A, an integral step in the Î²-oxidation of fatty acids (8Wu W.-J. Feng Y., He, X. Hofstein H.A. Raleigh D.P. Tonge P.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3987-3994Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Other members of the superfamily catalyze dehalogenation (9Crooks G.P. Copley S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 38: 11645-11649Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), carbon-carbon bond cleavage (10Pelletier D.A. Harwood C.S. J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4630-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). In each case, the substrate for enzymatic reaction is an acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) thioester. Each member of the crotonase superfamily, for which a mechanism has been proposed, shares mechanistic similarities, related in each case to the stabilization of a transition state enolate by a conserved oxyanion hole (12Gerlt J.A.

The diverse biochemical functions of the crotonase superfamily suggest that, from a genomic perspective, it is very difficult to delineate the role of any particular crotonase homologue in any genome from sequence alone. At this time, individual expression and assay of each gene and gene product would be required to begin to understand its contribution to metabolism. Even then, the mechanistic details of crotonase activity will be difficult to determine. Structural studies of enzymes of the crotonase superfamily are thus vital to the current understanding of the biochemical nature of this group. The structures of four members of the crotonase superfamily have been published to date: ECH (13Engel C.K. Mathieu M. Zeelen J.P. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K.

In addition, the structure of an enoyl-CoA hydratase homologue from humans has been published recently, which exhibits the ability to bind RNA (16Kurimoto K. Fukai S. Nureki O. Muto Y. Yokoyama S. Structure. 2001; 9: 1253-1263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present the crystal structure of OCH, into which we have modeled the native substrate, 6-oxo camphor, and a postulated enolate intermediate to (2R,4S)-Î±-campholinic acid. Although the hexameric global organization of OCH is similar to enoyl-CoA hydratase, the structure reveals many differences, which suggest a wider spectrum of mechanistic and structural diversity for the crotonase superfamily than previously envisaged. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. 6-Oxo camphor was obtained as detailed in Ref. 6Grogan G. Roberts G.A. Bougioukou D. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. J. Biol.

Plasmid pGEMT, restriction enzymes, and buffers were purchased fromPromega. Escherichia coli strains used in this study were BL21(DE3) and B8434(DE3). The plasmid vectors used were pGEMT (Promega) and pET-26b(+) (Novagen). E. coli strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth with 30 Î¼g mlâ1kanamycin at 37 Â°C. Cultures were routinely grown to an optical density of A 600 = 0.6 and then induced for expression of OCH by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside and then grown for a further 3 h. The gene encoding OCH, camK had been sequenced and cloned previously from the chromosomal DNA of Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 (6Grogan G. Roberts G.A. Bougioukou D. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. J. Biol.

A pGEMT construct consisting of a 4.3-kb EcoR1 restriction fragment from this study was used as the template for a PCR reaction designed to amplify the gene with NdeI and EcoR1 sites engineered at the 5â² and 3â² end of the camK gene, respectively. The primers were 5â² GGAGGAAGTCATATGAAGCAATTGGCCACC 3â² and 5â² CGGAATTCTCACTGTTCGGACTCCATTCCC 3â². camK was amplified in a PCR reaction using conditions outlined previously. The amplified gene was cleaned and ligated into pET26b(+) generating plasmid pGG3. Sequencing of this plasmid confirmed the DNA sequence of the amplified fragment. The methionine auxotroph E. coli B834 (DE3) transformed with pGG3 was cultured in 4 Ã 500 ml of a liquid culture medium containing 2 mm MgSO4; 37 mmNH4Cl; 44 mm KH2PO4; 85 mm NaH2PO4; 0.09 mmFeSO4Â·7H2O; 22.2 mmglucose; 40 mg each of the 20 common amino acids (except methionine, which was substituted with D/L selenomethionine); 1 mg each of riboflavin, niacinamide, thiamine, and pyridoxine monohydrochloride; 30 Î¼g mlâ1 kanamycin. Cultures were grown at 37 Â°C in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm until an optical density ofA 600 = 0.4 was reached, at which point, 1 mm isopropyl-Î²-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added as inducer. Cells were harvested after 3 h of further incubation at 37 Â°C in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm. OCH and its selenomethionine derivative were purified as detailed in Ref. 6Grogan G. Roberts G.A.

Crystals of the native and selenomethionyl enzymes were grown by the vapor diffusion hanging drop technique. In each case, a 10 mg/ml protein solution containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 Î¼mphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was mixed in a 50:50 ratio with reservoir to form the hanging drops. For the native enzyme, the reservoir solution consisted of 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 28% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 4,000 Da (adapted from Hampton screen II). For the selenomethionyl enzyme, the reservoir contained 0.1 m MES, pH 5.5, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 37.5% (v/v) 5,000 Da monomethyl ether, and 0.2% (w/v) n-octyl-Î²-d-glucopyranoside.

A native data set extending to 2.0 â« was collected on a single crystal of the native enzyme, which had been flash-frozen previously at 120 K in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 95% (v/v) reservoir and 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The data were collected on station 14.2 at the Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Daresbury, United Kingdom, using an ADSC Quantum-4 detector.

Subsequently, a three wavelength multi-anomalous dispersion experiment was conducted on beamline BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France, also using an MAR Research CCD detector. The three data sets were collected from a single crystal of the selenomethioyl enzyme, which was flash-frozen at 120 K using only the reservoir solution as a cryoprotectant.

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) and scaled and merged internally by this program. Automated Patterson searching with data to 2.4 â« located 16 of the 18 expected Se sites, corresponding to six molecules of 6-oxo camphor hydrolase in the asymmetric unit. These positions were refined and then the phases were calculated using SOLVE. The native data set (extending to 2.0-â« resolution) was then scaled with the MAD data using SCALEIT in the ccp4 suite (21Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and used in combination with the new phase to produce electron density maps. These were of good enough quality for model building, which was performed automatically using the warpNtrace option of ARP-WARP (22Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). The resulting model, consisting of a hexamer of 6-oxo camphor hydrolase, was then refined against the 2.0-â« data using REFMAC in the ccp4 suite and corrected manually using the X-AUTOFIT option in QUANTA (Accelrys Inc., San Diego CA). Solvent molecules were included in the model via the ARP facility in REFMAC. During this process, a randomly selected set of the data (5% of the total) was excluded from refinement for the purpose of Rfree cross-validation. Refinement statistics and details of the final protein model are given in Table I. Molecular modeling was used to construct models for two species along the reaction pathway with the CHARMM program and force field (23Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J.

Models for the substrates were built using QUANTA (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA), and the atom types and charges were assigned using standard CHARMM parameter sets (25Momany F.A. Rone R. J. Comp. Chem. 1992; 13: 888-900Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar). All crystallographic water molecules were retained except for those in the putative active site. Of the five water molecules that were located in the active site, two with B values of 32 and 35 â«2 were removed as they clashed with the modeled substrate. The substrate itself was docked according to information gleaned from known crotonase mechanism and the stereochemical constraints of the reaction. Hydrogen atoms were built using the HBUILT functionality of CHARMM (26Brunger A.T. Karplus M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 148-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Examination of the energetics of hydrogen bond formation by the His side chains led to a model where two histidines (His-45 and His-122), both of which form part of the putative active site, were protonated. The geometry and energetics of the docked substrates and protein were optimized by carrying out energy minimizations. These were performed with atoms within a 10-â« radius around the substrate subject to decreasing constraints whereas the atoms beyond this were restrained by a harmonic force of 10.0 kcal/mol/â«2. Minimizations were carried out using the Steepest Descent and Adopted Basis Newton Raphson algorithms (23Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp.

The quaternary structure of OCH is superficially similar to the parent enzyme of the superfamily, enoyl-CoA hydratase (13Engel C.K. Mathieu M. Zeelen J.P. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), dienoyl-CoA isomerase (14Modis Y. Filppula S.A. Novikov D.K. Norledge B. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4630-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), being a homogeneous hexamer composed of two stacked trimers (Fig. 4). Homology between the six monomers of the OCH hexamer is high (root mean square deviation = 0.15 to 0.22 â« calculated on CÎ±). The hexamer is a flattened sphere with approximate overall dimensions of 80 Ã 76 Ã 71 â«. An octahedrally coordinated Na+ ion is present at the 3-fold axis of each trimer, coordinated viawater molecules to residues Arg-168 and Asp-186 from each constituent monomer (Fig. 5). The conclusion that this coordinating species is a sodium ion rather than a water molecule or isoelectronic Mg2+ was made because of the very distinctive octahedral coordination geometry and metal/water distances of 2.4â2.5 â«, both of which correlate with sodium ion binding (17Nayal M. Di Cera E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,18Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 872-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Trimer stabilization appears to be mediated by a mixture of polar and hydrophobic interactions between Î±-5 (residues 167â174) and Î±-8 (residues 214â226) of each monomer. Tyr-171 (A) is H-bonded to Glu-192 (B; 2.5 â«); Leu-174 (monomer A) interacts with Leu-225 (monomer B). In addition, Asn-167 (A) is H-bonded to the carbonyl of Val-127 (B; 2.8 â«).Figure 5One of the two identical sodium ion binding sites on the 3-fold axis of the OCH hexamer. The sodium ion (large gray sphere) is hexagonally coordinated to six water molecules (white spheres), which in turn hydrogen-bond to side chains immediately surrounding the metal ion binding site. Hydrogen bonding and metal ion coordinating interactions are indicated by dashed lines, and side chains from different dimers are labeled as unprimed, primed, or double primed. Sodium â water distances are 2.4â2.5 â«. The figure was made using MOLSCRIPT (30Kraulis P.J. J. Appl.

The secondary structural elements, in common with other crotonase superfamily members, form four turns of a Î²Î±Î² superhelix, resulting in an inverted prism whereof the top layer of twisted Î²-sheet is formed from the five well defined Î²-strands, the most N-terminal being antiparallel, the remainder parallel. One face of the inverted prism consists of a layer formed from five near-flat coil regions, which exhibit classical Î²-sheet bonding only in the central region of the sheet. Of these strands, all are parallel except the most C-terminal, which is antiparallel. The other face of the prism is formed by three Î±-helices, Î±-2, (residues 42â57), Î±-3 (residues 87â106), and Î±-8 (residues 214â226), the last being the N-terminal region of the large, kinked C-terminal helix (Î±-8/Î±-9), the distal region of which (Î±-9) loops around the core monomer structure. This is in contrast with the constituent monomers of other hexameric members of the crotonase superfamily, wherein the C-terminal helix of e.g. ECH forms a discrete, second domain (Fig. 6). Î±-9 is also involved in hexamer formation, making contact with one monomer of the adjacent trimer. Although the location of the OCH active site has yet to be established from a ligand-bound structural complex, we have identified a hydrophobic pocket near the center of the inverted prism apex, which bears many characteristics suggestive of a putative active site. This pocket is wholly enclosed within one monomer, in common with MMD (11Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4630-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but in contrast to ECH, DCI, and CBD, for which the active sites are observed at the trimer interface. Entrance to the pocket from the solvent appears to be gated by Phe-79. The pocket is bound on one side by helices Î±-2, Î±-3, and Î±-9 and is largely hydrophobic, but the protrusion of five polar residues, Glu-244, Asp-154, His-145, His-122, and His-45, into the cavity is noteworthy. The distinctive (G/A)G(G/A) turn motif in the majority of other crotonase sequences (7Holden H.M. Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Acc. Chem.

His-122 adopts unfavorable Ï and Ïangles of +42.8 and +58.1Â°. The dihedral angles for most other amino acid residues lie within permitted regions of the Ramachandran plot. The other notable exception is His-145, which adopts Ï and Ï angles of â97.6 and â105.1Â°, respectively. We have so far been unable to obtain a crystal structure of OCH bound with either the natural substrate, 6-oxo camphor (this would be unlikely as turnover is very rapid), or the product, (2R,4S)-Î±-campholinic acid. However, the location of a putative active site, in conjunction with known crotonase mechanisms and the stereochemical constraints of the reaction, have allowed us to model both substrate and putative intermediate into the proposed active site region (Fig. 7). We have suggested previously (5Grogan G. Graf J. Jones A. Parsons S. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 39: 1111-1114Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond may proceed via nucleophilic attack at one prochiral carbonyl in 6-oxo camphor by a water molecule activated by an acidic residue in the enzyme active site, analogous to the hydrolyase mechanism of water addition observed in ECH (27Hofstein H.A. Feng Y. Anderson V.E. Tonge P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9508-9516Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Such attack would have to occur from the left hand side of the molecule as drawn in Fig. 8 (pro-S) to result in the observed product stereochemistry (S) at the acetate-substituted center. When the substrate is modeled into the active site (Fig. 7, top), the geminal dimethyl group of the substrate is shown to be oriented toward a hydrophobic region of the active site making interactions with dominant hydrophobic residues such as Phe-82 (5.1 â«), Ile-93 (4.0 â«), Trp-90 (3.9 â«), and Leu-84 (3.8 â«). In this orientation, either the prominent Glu-244 or Asp-154 residue is well placed for the activation of a water molecule for attack at the (pro-S) carbonyl side of the substrate. The modeled orientation also allows for the (pro-R) carbonyl of the substrate to be stabilized by hydrogen bonding to His-122. Ring opening of the substrate may proceedvia the enolate intermediate 8 shown in Fig. 8. In other crotonase homologues, intermediate enolates, thought too active to be kinetically competent (7Holden H.M. Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), are thought to be stabilized by an oxyanion hole formed between two peptidic N-H groups from residue positions that are conserved throughout the previously determined superfamily structures (e.g. Ala-98 and Gly-141 in ECH). In OCH, the replacement of the GG141G motif with the N121HP motif suggests that this oxyanion hole is absent or constructed differently. Any proposed enolate must be stabilized by some other factor. Modeling of the enolate intermediate (Fig. 7,bottom) suggests that the enolate may be H-bonded to His-45 (2.6 â«), the carboxylate moiety of the intermediate being H-bonded both to His-122 (2.7 â«) and His-145 (2.9 â«), which are both observed to be held in unusual conformations (see above). The structure of 6-oxo camphor hydrolase suggests that OCH is more removed from a possible progenitor of the crotonase superfamily of proteins than members described previously. Although the hexameric global structure is superficially similar to ECH, for example, the presence of sodium ions at the 3-fold axis of each constituent trimer of OCH was not observed in ECH, even though a similar coordination environment was observed in the latter protein. A nickel ion was reported to be coordinated by equivalent histidines along the 3-fold trimer axis of MMD, but this was thought to be an artifact of nickel/His tag-dependent purification (11Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4630-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the case of OCH, sodium may arise from the purification or crystallization buffer. There does not appear to be an absolute dependence on any metal ion for OCH activity as evidenced by previous studies, however. Indeed, an increase in NaCl concentration was not observed to affect enzymatic activity (6Grogan G. Roberts G.A. Bougioukou D. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12565-12572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Significant divergence from other members of the crotonase superfamily is also observed in the structure of the constituent monomer of OCH. Comparison of residues 13â192 of the ECH monomer and residues 31â210 of OCH (Fig. 6) reveals that the N-terminal catalytic domain of ECH is, for the most part, structurally conserved in OCH (root mean square deviation value of 4.82 â«). The C-terminal helix is positioned very differently, however, not forming a discrete domain as in ECH, but rather looping around the monomer structure of OCH to form the wall of a hydrophobic pocket, which may constitute the active site. The active site of OCH appears to have been recruited from a hydrophobic well bound by helices in the interior of the monomer, which already exists partially in ECH. In the case of OCH, this active site has been completed by recruitment of the C-terminal trimerization domain helix as a further wall of the active site seemingly at no cost to trimer stabilization, which is satisfied by alternative regions in OCH than ECH. It may be that trimer interactions centered around a sodium ion have evolved as a mechanism of stabilization to offset any loss of stabilization as a result of the recruitment of the C-terminal helix in ECH. It is also possible that the recruited C-terminal helix is positioned to provide the primary catalytic residue (Glu-244) for water activation leading to carbon-carbon bond cleavage. The C-terminal divergence among crotonase homologs is reflected additionally in the sequence alignment of a series of members of the crotonase superfamily (Fig. 9), illustrating comparatively poor conservation of sequence in this region. The sequence alignments of selected regions of OCH, ECH, MMD, CBD, and DCI (Fig. 9) are also revealing in respect to conserved catalytic residues throughout crotonase homologs. In conjunction with sequence comparison and structural studies, site-directed mutagenesis experiments have revealed that although catalytic residues may be conserved between superfamily members, they may make no catalytic contribution. This appears to be the case with Glu-124 in OCH (equivalent to catalytic Glu-44 in ECH), which is H-bonded to His-122 and therefore presumably cannot have a primary catalytic role. Asp-154 (OCH), which protrudes into the putative active site, is near homologous to the catalytically active Asp-145 in CBD. The presence of Glu-244 in the putative active site is particularly noteworthy, as such an extremely C-terminal residue in the active site of a crotonase homolog would be unprecedented, this area usually being involved in trimerization. Another striking divergence of the primary structure of OCH from that of other crotonase homologs is the absence of the (G/A)G(G/A) motif, which, in other members, provides the conserved glycine for formation of the oxyanion hole for enolate stabilization. In OCH, (G/A)G(G/A) appears to be replaced by an N121HP motif, His-122 being held in an unusual conformation, perhaps suggestive of a mechanistic role for this residue. In other homologues, the oxyanion hole is formed by peptidic backbone N-H groups (such as Ala-98 and Gly-141 in ECH), but equivalent residues in OCH, Ile-77, and His-122 are not suitably positioned for this role spatially. A proposed mechanism must account for proton donation to the intermediate enolate. We have already shown that, as the abiotic acid-catalyzed ring opening of 5 proceeds with the same diastereoselectivity as the enzyme catalyzed reaction (5Grogan G. Graf J. Jones A. Parsons S. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 39: 1111-1114Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), that the proton donated to the intermediate is not necessarily enzyme-derived. Indeed, Bahnson et al. (28Bahnson B.J. Anderson V.E. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have shown recently that, for enoyl-CoA hydratase, both hydroxy group and proton in the product of enoyl-CoA hydration are derived from the same water molecule. It is possible that a similar concerted mechanism is responsible for the formal hydration of the 6-oxo camphor molecule. If this were the case a more accurate designation of 6-oxo camphor-hydrolyase might be appropriate to OCH. It is notable that among the range of activities that have been attributed to the crotonase superfamily, the activity of OCH is unusual in that the native substrate is not an acyl-CoA thioester. It is difficult at this stage, however, to assess whether the ability of OCH to bind coenzyme A has been lost, as although residues have been implicated for coenzyme A binding by other crotonase homologs (e.g. Lys-92 and Lys-101 in ECH (13Engel C.K. Mathieu M. Zeelen J.P. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)) these are characteristic of individual homologs, a general motif for coenzyme A binding not having been identified in this superfamily. The addition of 1 mm coenzyme A to OCH assay has no detectable effect on activity, however (results not shown), suggesting no competitive binding of coenzyme A over the native substrate, 6-oxo camphor. The range of enzymatic processes catalyzed by crotonases identifies them both as a source of many new activities with potential biotechnological application and, additionally, as a range of metabolic activities for possible therapeutic targeting. However, the function of crotonase sequence homologs is difficult to determine without their isolation and assay. The structure of OCH reveals significant structural divergence from other superfamily members, illustrated by the recruitment of the C-terminal helix for active site formation and the possible provision of catalytic residues. Structural differences such as this, which hinge on short coil regions, are difficult to predict. Alternative substrate binding modes that do not require either substrate ligation to coenzyme A or oxyanion hole stabilization of enolate intermediates are also implied by the OCH structure. This may point to a wider range of undiscovered enzyme activities recruited from the crotonase fold than previously envisaged with further implications for the more cautious interpretation of enzyme function from sequence primary sequence data alone in functional/structural genomics projects.

We identified the functional TCL1 promoter by mapping four transcriptional start sites 24â30 bp downstream of a TATA box. A 424-bp fragment upstream of the major start site showed robust promoter activity comparable with SV40 in both TCL1 expressing and non-expressing cell lines. Additional constructs spanning 10 kb upstream and 20 kb downstream of the start site showed only modest increases in reporter activity indicating that TCL1expression is primarily controlled by the promoter. Ten putative Sp1-binding sites were identified within 300 bp of the start site, and three of these specifically bound Sp1. A dose-dependent transactivation of the TCL1 promoter with Sp1 addition in Sp1-negative Drosophila SL2 cells was observed, and mutation of the three identified Sp1-binding sites significantly repressed reporter gene expression in 293T cells, confirming a key role for Sp1 in activating the TCL1 promoter in vivo. In TCL1 silent cell lines, CpG DNA methylation was rarely observed at functional Sp1 sites, and methylation of a previously reported NotI restriction site was associated with dense CpG methylation rather than endogenous TCL1 gene silencing.

These chromosomal rearrangements reposition T-cell receptor Î±/Î´- or Î²-chain control sequences next to theTCL1 coding region leading to T-cell-specific dysregulation. A tumorigenic role for this aberrant expression has been confirmed from transgenic studies in which TCL1 dysregulation targeted to T-cells mainly in the thymus cause mice to exclusively develop mature peripheral T-cell malignancies (3Virgilio L.

Evidence that this dysregulation promotes B-cell malignancies has been obtained from transgenic mouse studies in which TCL1 is aberrantly expressed only in B-cells or in both T- and B-cells (8Bichi R.

In contrast to known chromosomal rearrangements that cause aberrant expression in mature T-cell tumors, little is known about the mechanism(s) regulating TCL1 expression during development or supporting its aberrant expression in mature B-cell malignancies. The TCL1 promoter and other potential regulatory regions have not been characterized, and there have been no reports of 14q32.1 rearrangements with associated dysregulation of TCL1 for B-cell malignancies, including TCL1-expressing Burkitt lymphomas (BL), B-chronic lymphocytic leukemias (Î²-CLL), or DLBCL (15Yuille M.R.

Also, treatment ofTCL1 non-expressing Jurkat and CEM T-cells with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2â²-deoxycytidine (5-AC) was reported to activate TCL1 expression, suggesting a potential role for epigenetic modifications in TCL1 gene silencing (15Yuille M.R.

Briefly, EMSA probes and cold competitors were complementary double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing each of the 10 identified Sp1 consensus sites within the TCL1 core promoter region (see Fig. 1). The probe sequences are as follows: Sp1(consensus), 5â²-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3â²; Sp1(A), 5â²-CAGCAGCAGAGGGCGGCGGTCGGTG-3â²; Sp1(B), 5â²-CCTCGAGGAAGGCGCGGGCCAGCTG-3â²; Sp1(C), 5â²-CGGGACGTAGCGCCTGCGCGGGACC-3â²; Sp1(D), 5â²-CCCACAAACCCCCGCCCCATCCTGCC-3â²; Sp1(E), 5â²-GCCTTACGCCCCGCCCCAAGGTCGT-3â²; Sp1(F), 5â²-ACCCGGGGTCCCGCCCCAAGACCGT-3â²; Sp1(G), 5â²-CCGTCCTCCCGCCCCGCCGCTTGGT-3â²; Sp1(H), 5â²-GCCGCTTGGTGGCGCCCGCATGCTG-3â²; Sp1(I), 5â²-CTTGCTTCTTAGGCGGCCCGAGGAC-3â²; and Sp1(J), 5â²-CTTAGGCGGCCCGAGGACGCCATGG-3â². Mutant Sp1 probes were also created by changing the GC box-binding sequence from CCGCCC to CCGAAC to create Mut-Sp1(D), Mut-Sp1(E), Mut-Sp1(F), and Mut-Sp1(G) (20Kriwacki R.W. Schultz S.C.

Probes were end-labeled with [Î³-32P]dATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). 10 Î¼g of BCBL-1 or Ramos nuclear extract was incubated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 2 Î¼g of poly(dI-dC), and 10 Î¼g of bovine serum albumin in a 20-Î¼l reaction volume. Radiolabeled probe (20,000 cpm per reaction) was added, and samples were incubated for 20 min at 25 Â°C. DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis for 2 h at 150 V in a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. Competition assays were performed with a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe. Antibody blocking assays were performed by adding 2 Î¼g of either Sp1 antibody (clone 1C6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to the reaction 10 min prior to incubation with probes. 10 Î¼g per lane of SL2 cell extract or 15 Î¼g per lane of cell extracts from a variety of humanTCL1-expressing and silent lymphocyte cell lines was resolved on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations). Western blotting was performed as described previously (5Said J.W. Hoyer K.K. French S.W. Rosenfelt L. Garcia-Lloret M. Koh P.J. Cheng T.C. Sulur G.G. Pinkus G.S. Kuehl W.M. Rawlings D.J. Wall R.

The membrane was incubated with Sp1 antiserum (1:2000 clone 1C6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse antiserum (Cell Signaling Technology) and exposed to film following development with ECL+Plus (AmershamBiosciences).

Sodium bisulfite-treated DNA was desalted with the Wizard DNA Clean-up System (Promega); 6.3 m NaOH was added to a final concentration of 0.3 m followed by incubation at 37 Â°C for 15 min. 10 m ammonium acetate, pH 7.0, was added to a final concentration of 3 m, followed by ethanol precipitation, pellet drying, and resuspension in 100 Î¼l of TE. 2 Î¼l of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA was PCR-amplified for 47 cycles using multiple sense-strand primer pair combinations forTCL1 followed by 30 cycles of nested PCR amplification. Primers used to amplify sodium bisulfite-treated DNA include 5â²-GGGGGGGTTTTTTAGAAGAAGAAAGGG-3â² and 5â²-CCAAAACCTCTCAAAACCACTC-3â². Nested primers used were either 5â²-GGTGTTTTTTTAGTAGTAGTAGAGGG-3â² or 5â²-GTTTTAGGGAGTAAGTTAGGTTGGG-3â². PCR products were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector and transformed into DH5Î± bacteria, and individual clones were sequenced. A transcription initiation site has been suggested at 41 bp downstream of a putative TATA box based upon the initial reverse transcriptase-PCR cloning of the TCL1 cDNA (1Virgilio L. Narducci M.G.

Bradshaw P.S. Brooks L. Catovsky D. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001; 30: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the TCL1start site has not been experimentally determined, and this position would be inconsistent with known start sites from TATA box-dependent promoters, which are generally 25â30 nucleotides downstream of the first T in the TATA sequence (reviewed in Refs. 23Sawadogo M. Sentenac A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 711-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar and 24Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used S1 nuclease protection analysis to identify the transcription start site(s) of TCL1 in order to help locate the major promoter for further investigation (Fig. 2). In TCL1 expressing 2F7 and Ramos BL cells, the major site of transcription initiation is a cytosine located 30 nucleotides downstream of the TATA box. There are also three identical minor sites of transcription initiation in these two cell lines. These sites include an adenine at 24 nucleotides, a guanine at 25 nucleotides, and a guanine at 27 nucleotides downstream of the TATA box (summarized in Fig. 1). These sites are consistent with transcription initiation sites in TATA box-dependent promoters. In addition, S1 nuclease protection products were not seen in KS-1 primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells, consistent with a lack of TCL1 transcription in this line (5Said J.W. Hoyer K.K. French S.W. Rosenfelt L. Garcia-Lloret M. Koh P.J. Cheng T.C. Sulur G.G. Pinkus G.S. Kuehl W.M. Rawlings D.J. Wall R. Teitell M.A. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and no products were observed with a probe incubated with S1 nuclease in the absence of input RNA (data not shown). To date, regions suspected to contain TCL1 promoter activity have not been analyzed. We sought to define the TCL1 promoter and began a search just upstream of the TATA box and transcription initiation sites. A genomic fragment was cloned beginning at the ATG translation start site and extending to minus 424 bp from the major transcription start site using the originally reported upstream sequence as a guide for primer design (1Virgilio L. Narducci M.G. Isobe M. Billips L.G. Cooper M.D. Croce C.M. Russo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12530-12534Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Sequencing of a BL41-derived fragment (and one derived from TC32 Ewing sarcoma cell genomic DNA, data not shown) revealed that the originally reported 5â² sequence contains an â¼60-bp duplication that is not found in clones generated here or in recent data released from GenBankTM (data base entry GI 624960) (1Virgilio L. Narducci M.G. Isobe M. Billips L.G. Cooper M.D. Croce C.M. Russo G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12530-12534Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This fragment was inserted into pGL3-basic, creating p424TCL1-luciferase. Previously it was shown that EBV infection has no effect on endogenousTCL1 expression levels and that EBV-immortalized peripheral blood cells, along with BL lines, express abundant TCL1 (5Said J.W. Hoyer K.K. French S.W. Rosenfelt L. Garcia-Lloret M. Koh P.J. Cheng T.C. Sulur G.G. Pinkus G.S. Kuehl W.M. Rawlings D.J. Wall R. Teitell M.A. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 555-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Reporter activity in three of these highly expressing B-cell lines (75714, BL41, and 2F7) was 15â35-fold elevated over an empty vector construct, pGL3-basic, that lacks known promoter activity (Fig. 3 A). PEL lines silence B-cell-specific gene transcription, including TCL1, and are derived from terminal stages of B-cell differentiation that normally lack TCL1 expression (25Drexler H.G. Uphoff C.C. Gaidano G. Carbone A. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1998; 12: 1507-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 26Matolcsy A. Nador R.G. Cesarman E. Knowles D.M. Am. J.

In four silent PEL lines (BCBL-1, BC-1, BC-3, and KS-1), the TCL1 reporter gene was expressed 15â45-fold over pGL3-basic. In addition, a 12-fold activation was seen in Jurkat T-cells, which also do not express the endogenous TCL1 gene. These results indicate that the â424TCL1 gene fragment contains strong promoter activity and lacks functional silencing elements in transient transfection assays in lymphocytes. Furthermore, the level of activity was roughly equivalent to the activity seen with a robust SV40 promoter positive-control construct in all lines examined. We next performed an extended search for further 5â² sequences affectingTCL1 promoter activity. Overlapping fragments from 191- to 943-bp upstream of the transcription start site were cloned into pGL3-basic and tested for promoter activity. All of the engineered constructs demonstrated robust expression in TCL1-negative BC-3 PEL and 293T fibroblast cells (Fig. 3 B). In BC-3 PEL cells, reporter gene activity was essentially equivalent for constructs containing 350â943 bp of 5â² sequence and ranged from 17- to 25-fold stronger than pGL3-basic. This indicates that cis-elements required for activity in transient assays are localized within 350 bp of the transcription start site and that no additional strong enhancer or silencer motifs are within 1 kb upstream. Reporter gene expression in 293T cells was 15â35-fold higher compared with levels seen in BC-3 PEL cells using a similar range of reporter constructs (Fig. 3 B). In fact, a 191-bp 5â² fragment showed reporter activity equivalent to that seen with a 424-bp fragment, suggesting that all essential core promoter components are present within the first 200 bp 5â² of the transcription start site. In sum, these findings suggest theTCL1 core promoter region functions in a tissue-nonspecific manner. Similar findings have been reported from the analyses of many other core promoters from tissue-specific genes (28Malone C.S. Omori S.A. Gangadharan D. Wall R.

We have systematically analyzed the ability of p300, either alone or in response to an interacting activator, to acetylate specific recombinant histones in the context of free histones, histone octamers, or nucleosomal arrays. Our results indicate that p300 has an intrinsic ability to acetylate all core histones but that the level and specificity of histone acetylation is indeed context-dependent. Thus, H3 and H4 are preferentially acetylated in free octamers, whereas all histones are nearly equally acetylated, in an activator-dependent manner, in chromatin. Moreover, H3 and H4 show H2A and H2B tail-independent acetylation in chromatin, whereas maximal H2A and H2B acetylation in this context is dependent upon H3 and H4 tails (but not their acetylation). In further support of an apparent intrinsic preference of p300 for the H3 and H4 tails, as well as an important role for direct interactions of p300 with unacetylated H3 and H4 tails in both acetylation and transcription, we have shown that p300 selectively acetylates isolated H3 and H4 tails, that p300 strongly and selectively binds to free unacetylated H3 and H4 tails, and that p300-mediated acetylation of nucleosomal histones and transcriptional activation are selectively inhibited by isolated (unacetylated) H3 and H4 tails.

These structural alterations are mediated largely by postsynthetic modifications of the flexible N-terminal amino acids of the core histones and by ATP-dependent transitions in nucleosome structure and position (8Wu J.

Recent studies have indicated that steady-state levels of histone acetylation are maintained by a balanced equilibrium of histone acetylation and deacetylation (16Reid J.L. Lyer V.R. Brown P.O.

However, the histone code hypothesis proposes that different combinations of postsynthetic modifications may function as recognition signals for proteins that regulate transcription more directly (10Strahl B.D.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6141-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) have shown that bromodomains can serve as histone recognition motifs for cofactor association with histone tails. Our recent work (31An W. Palhan V.B. Karymov M.A. Leuba S.H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 811-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) has indicated that the removal of histone H3 and H4 tails or lysine-to-arginine substitutions at major acetylation sites impairs p300-dependent transcriptional activation by Gal4-VP16. Given that HAT-containing coactivators also can functionally modify various (non-histone) regulatory proteins (32Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar), these observations provide the first proof of a direct link between coactivator function and histone acetylation per se and thus extend earlier studies showing only correlations between these events.In this study, we generated a variety of histone-containing substrates and systematically examined functional interactions with p300. Our results reveal context-dependent differences in histone acetylation that are relevant to an understanding of the mechanisms by which p300-mediated histone acetylation affects transcription. In addition, the free histone tails, notably those of histone H3 and H4, are shown to modulate p300 activities in a manner that is largely independent of their acetylation state. p300 is shown to bind directly to unacetylated H3 and H4 tails but not to H2A and H2B tails. These results support the idea of an activator-independent, histone H3 and H4 tail-mediated chromatin binding activity of p300, which may contribute to functional effects of H3 and H4 tails in transcriptional regulation.DISCUSSIONWe recently demonstrated a direct link between the presence and acetylation status of histone H3 and H4 tails and p300-dependent transcription from chromatin templates (31An W. Palhan V.B. Karymov M.A. Leuba S.H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 811-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but the underlying mechanisms remain to be unraveled. In the present work, and through systematic analyses with purified wild type and mutant recombinant histones, we describe discrete patterns of p300-mediated acetylation with different histone substrates and a selective, acetylation-independent interaction of p300 with H3 and H4 tails. Our data clearly underscore an intrinsic preference of p300 for physical and functional interactions with H3 and H4 tails, and possible roles of their interaction in transcriptional regulation are discussed below.Substrate and Context Effects on p300-mediated Histone AcetylationAs a first step toward understanding the mechanisms, we investigated the histone acetylation activity of p300 with various substrates. One important observation, both confirming and extending previous results, is the effect of context on histone acetylation by p300. Thus, whereas all histones are good substrates when tested individually, H3 and H4 are the preferred substrates when free histone octamers are assayed at a limiting p300 concentration. By contrast, at the same limiting p300 concentration, all histones are acetylated in chromatin in response to a transcriptional activator.Context effects are also evident from studies with histone tail deletions. Thus, the joint deletion of H3 and H4 tails results in increased H2A and H2B acetylation in free histone octamers but, most significantly, decreased H2A and H2B acetylation in chromatin. In contrast, joint deletion of H2A and H2B tails has no significant effect on acetylation of H3 and H4 tails either in free octamers or in chromatin. Similar studies with histones containing lysine-to-arginine substitutions at the major acetylation sites indicated some modest interdependencies of acetylation events in free histone octamers but almost none in chromatin substrates. The latter results with histone tails that are largely intact has important implications for acetylation-independent binding of p300 to chromatin (see below).In almost all cases, these results are most simply explained by an intrinsic preference of p300 for H3 and H4 substrates and by competitive substrate interactions. This conclusion is supported by the observation that isolated H3 and H4 tails are both preferentially acetylated (by p300) relative to isolated H2A and H2B tails (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the context-dependent requirement of H3 and H4 tails for maximal H2A and H2B acetylation within chromatin must have another basis. This could reflect structural differences between tails within free and nucleosomal histones or the stabilization and enhanced catalytic activity of p300 on chromatin through interactions either with Gal4-VP16 (35Kundu T.K.

Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) or (via its bromodomain) with unacetylated (27Ornaghi P. Ballario P. Lena A.M. Gonzalez A. Filetici P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or acetylated (26Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L., He, C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6141-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) H3 and H4 tails.Functional Implications of H3 and H4 Tail-dependent Association of p300 with ChromatinCompetition studies (Figs. 3and 4) allowed an analysis of the effect of each histone tail on p300 activity and showed a dosage-dependent repression of p300 function that was specific for H3 and H4 tails. Similar inhibitory effects were also observed with free histone H3 and H4 tails containing lysine-to-arginine substitutions in major acetylation sites. This suggests that p300 may recognize distinct features of the H3 and H4 tails other than acetylated lysines, as recently reported for GCN5 bromodomain and histone H4 tail interaction (27Ornaghi P. Ballario P. Lena A.M. Gonzalez A. Filetici P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed inhibitory effects could reflect masking of substrate recognition sites (e.g. bromodomains) in p300 and/or the induction of conformational changes that decrease p300 acetylation activity. The in vitro binding assays (Fig. 5) further confirm dominant interactions of p300, not only with wild type H3 and H4 tails but also with mutant tails containing lysine-to-arginine substitutions, again suggesting the selective recognition of H3 and H4 tails by p300.Although structural studies of bromodomain-acetylated peptide complexes support the hypothesis that acetylated tails may directly recruit factors that are functionally associated with chromatin (26Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L., He, C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 28Hudson B.P. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6141-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), our results suggest that p300 alone may associate with chromatin through interactions with unmodified H3 and H4 tails. Indeed, our results are in good agreement with a recent report (38Manning E. Ikehara T. Ito T. Kadonaga J. Kraus W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showing that histone acetylation plays a minor role (at least quantitatively) in the stable bromodomain-dependent association of p300 with chromatin or isolated histones. However, our finding that H3 and H4 interact equally well with p300 differs slightly from the finding (38Manning E. Ikehara T. Ito T. Kadonaga J. Kraus W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that p300 interacts preferentially with H3. These divergent results may reflect differences in the assays employedânamely GST-p300 bromodomain binding with a mixture of all four core histones versusbinding of individual histone tail-fused proteins with full-length p300.It is worth noting that incubation with acetyl-CoA promotes interactions between p300 and mutant H3 and H4 tails containing lysine-to-arginine substitution at the major acetylation sites (Fig. 5 A, lanes 15 and 16 versus 19 and 20). Because these mutations do not abrogate acetylation of the free histones (Fig. 2 A), secondary acetylation may compensate for reduced interactions that result from the lysine-to-arginine mutations at the major acetylation sites but may involve mainly other residues. In this regard, previous studies have indicated that other residues or regions of the histone tails may provide major sites for acetylation-independent recognition of histone tails by bromodomains (27Ornaghi P. Ballario P. Lena A.M. Gonzalez A. Filetici P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Owen D.J. Ornaghi P. Yang J.C. Lowe N. Evans P.R. Ballario P. Neuhaus D. Filetici P. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6141-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).The Role of Histone Modifications in Gene RegulationThe finding that free H3 and H4 tails interact strongly with p300, together with the observation that acetylation of major lysine substrates of histone tails seems not to be necessary for this association, raises the possibility that the acetylation of specific lysine residues may mainly be involved in recruiting other regulatory factor(s). Such factors could be associated with subsequent chromatin reorganization events that lead to an active state of transcription. In this respect, our observations support the view that the recognition of modified histone tails by various factors or protein complexes (10Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6510) Google Scholar, 11Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 19Jenuwein T. Allis C.D.

Biol. 2001; 2: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) may account for the indispensable features of histone H3 and H4 tails in our studies. In the context of this model, the identification and characterization of potential factors/complexes that associate with modified histone tails will facilitate the elucidation of the mechanistic role of histone modifications. Indeed, recent studies have documented modified histone tails as recognition motifs for highly conserved domains in chromatin-associated factors (10Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6510) Google Scholar, 11Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 19Jenuwein T. Allis C.D.

Moreover, specific tail modifications seem to be primarily, if not solely, responsible for the recruitment and anchoring of various transcriptional regulatory factors in transcription (26Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L., He, C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 28Hudson B.P. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol.

Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). In this regard, a recent study (43Zegerman P. Canas B. Pappin D. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11621-11624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the histone H3 N terminus can bind to the NuRD complex when lysine 9 is methylated, but that methylation at lysine 4 effectively disrupts this interaction. These results suggest specific roles for different tail modifications in regulating the association or recruitment of various factors.Our findings suggest a novel role(s) for H3 and H4 tails in p300 recruitment and retention that is correlated with essential roles of histone H3 and H4 tails in p300-mediated transcription (31An W. Palhan V.B. Karymov M.A. Leuba S.H. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 811-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear at which stage(s) the described p300-tail interactions play a role. They could be required before or during activator-targeted recruitment of p300 to promoters or for continuous and more stable association of p300 with chromatin after recruitment and in fulfillment of the p300 coactivator function. In any case, our results suggest that direct contact between p300 and histone H3 and H4 tails is involved, at some stage, in p300 function. Further characterization of the timing and function of histone acetylation events during the course of the overall transcription reaction will facilitate the elucidation of the functional role of histone tails and their modifications. Chromatin structure plays a major role in all aspects of DNA function in eukaryotes (1Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar, 2Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar). The nucleosome core particle, the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, consists of a core histone octamer surrounded by 146 bp of DNA wrapped in a left-handed superhelix (3van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar, 4Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar, 5Hayes J.J. Hansen J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that chromatin structure is highly dynamic, with structural changes that result in alterations in gene activity (6Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 7Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). These structural alterations are mediated largely by postsynthetic modifications of the flexible N-terminal amino acids of the core histones and by ATP-dependent transitions in nucleosome structure and position (8Wu J. Grunstein M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 619-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 9Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar). Covalent modifications of nucleosomal histone tails have proved to be of major importance for various nuclear processes (10Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6510) Google Scholar, 11Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. Reinberg D.

Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), and the best characterized of these modifications is the post-translational acetylation of specific lysine residues (14Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Transcriptionally active regions of chromatin have long been correlated with the presence of hyperacetylated histones, whereas silent regions are correlated with the presence of hypoacetylated forms (1Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar, 15Allfrey V.G. Faulkner R. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 88: 786-794Crossref Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that steady-state levels of histone acetylation are maintained by a balanced equilibrium of histone acetylation and deacetylation (16Reid J.L. Lyer V.R. Brown P.O. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1297-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 17Vogelauer M., Wu, J. Suka N. Grunstein M.

Acetylation may alter internucleosomal interactions and thus alter higher order chromatin structure (4Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). However, the histone code hypothesis proposes that different combinations of postsynthetic modifications may function as recognition signals for proteins that regulate transcription more directly (10Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6510) Google Scholar, 11Turner B.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar,19Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar). p300 and its paralog, CBP, are well known multifunctional coactivators that mediate the action of a variety of transcription factors (20Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar) and possess intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT)1 activities (21Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). They can be recruited to promoters by direct interactions with DNA binding transcription factors (20Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar) and function with other cofactors such as p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) and the p160/SRC family of proteins (20Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). p300 contains a highly conserved bromodomain that is found in many chromatin-associated proteins (23Jeanmougin F. Wurtz J.M., Le Douarin B.

Nieto M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These rearrangements involve the coordination of cell-cell adhesion with cytoskeleton-based cell migration and cell shape changes. Thus, cytoskeleton interactions with adhesion complexes are probably of critical importance. We have usedDictyostelium as a model system to examine interactions between adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton during multicellular development. Dictyostelium has a simple and well defined life cycle that permits biochemical and genetic analyses of cell-cell interactions (2Loomis W.F. Dictyostelium discoideum: A Developmental System. Academic Press, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). During the aggregation stage of development, Dictyostelium undergoes a transition from individual cells to multicellular streams. The process begins with the chemotactic migration of single cells toward a central source of cAMP (2Loomis W.F. Dictyostelium discoideum: A Developmental System. Academic Press, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). Cell-cell contacts are initially established through the interdigitation of filopodia (3Choi A.H. Siu C.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1375-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The contacts break and reform continually as the cells migrate to the aggregation center (4Sesaki H. Siu C.-H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 504-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Even within large migratory multicellular streams, individual cells form only transient cell-cell contacts and continually exchange partners (5Shelden E. Knecht D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, cell-cell adhesion is mediated by large adhesion complexes composed of a core of adhesion molecules and peripheral attachments to the cytoskeleton (6Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). Within the complexes, cis- andtrans-oligomers of adhesion molecules can assemble into zippers and lattices (7Alattia J.R. Kurokawa H. Ikura M. Cell. Mol.

The expression of the next major cell adhesion molecule gp150 is activated at the cell aggregation stage (21Iranfar N. Fuller D. Sasik R. Hwa T. Laub M. Loomis W.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2590-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and rapid accumulation of gp150 occurs in the postaggregation stage (22Wang J. Hou L. Awrey D. Loomis W.F. Firtel R.A. Siu C.-H. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 734-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). gp80 is phospholipid-anchored (23Sadeghi H. da Silva A.M. Klein C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5512-55155Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Stadler J. Keenan T.W. Bauer G. Gerisch G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), as are many other adhesion molecules such as NCAM-120, axonin-1/TAX-1/TAG-1 (25Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 1151-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and T-cadherin (26Ranscht B. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Neuron. 1991; 7: 391-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Since these receptors lack direct access to the cytoplasm, the mechanism by which they engage the cytoskeleton is unclear. Many glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1-anchored proteins preferentially partition into rafts, which are membrane microdomains formed from the close packing of sterols and saturated lipids into liquid ordered structures (27Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Rafts can be isolated from cells as Triton X-100-insoluble floating fractions (TIFF) that contain the raft lipids, as well as GPI-anchored proteins, acylated proteins, and some transmembrane proteins (28Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 29Hooper N.M. Mol. Membr.

Raftlike membrane fragments have been isolated fromDictyostelium as both TIFF and a low density plasma membrane fraction after sonication. Both types of membrane fractions were highly enriched in sterols and contained many of the proteins found in the bulk plasma membrane, suggesting that raftlike domains exist in theDictyostelium plasma membrane (31Harris T.J.C.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48764-48774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that the major proteins in the complex sediment together, indicating that they are components of the same membrane domains (32Harris T.J.C. Ravandi A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48764-48774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). At the aggregation stage of development, gp80 is the main component of these complexes, suggesting that they participate in gp80-mediated adhesion. Indeed, large sterol-rich domains have been localized to gp80-mediated cell-cell contacts, and sterol sequestration weakens cell-cell adhesion (31Harris T.J.C. Awrey D.E. Cox B.J. Ravandi A. Tsang A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18640-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is also evident that raftlike domains facilitate gp80 oligomerization and adhesion complex formation (32Harris T.J.C. Ravandi A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48764-48774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of cytoskeleton attachment to these complexes remains to be elucidated. DuringDictyostelium aggregation, TIFF does become associated with cytoskeleton complexes and TIFF itself contains a number of cytoskeletal proteins, including actin, comitin, regulatory myosin light chain, and ponticulin (31Harris T.J.C. Awrey D.E. Cox B.J. Ravandi A. Tsang A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18640-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Harris T.J.C. Ravandi A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48764-48774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that ponticulin is the primary link between gp80 adhesion complexes and the actin cytoskeleton, since it is a major high affinity actin-binding protein in the plasma membrane ofDictyostelium cells (33Hitt A.L. Hartwig J.H. Luna E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1433-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To address this hypothesis and assess how such connections form and function, we monitored interactions among gp80, ponticulin, and actin through subcellular fractionation and localization studies in gene deletion and drug-treated cells during development. We found that gp80 is involved in establishing TIFF-cytoskeleton interactions during development. A major proportion of cellular ponticulin is associated with TIFF and the cytoskeleton and is required to mediate their interaction. gp80 apparently regulates ponticulin function by recruiting it into TIFF and cell-cell contacts. Ponticulin also has an effect on the size of gp80 adhesion complexes within multicellular streams. Dictyostelium discoideum strains were cultured in association withKlebsiella aerogenes (34Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In most experiments, thecsaA â, gp80-null strain (GT10) (17Harloff C. Gerisch G. Noegel A.A. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2011-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was compared with its parental strain AX2, and theponA â, ponticulin-null strain (Tf24.1) (33Hitt A.L. Hartwig J.H. Luna E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1433-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was compared with its parental strain KAX3. For development in suspension, cells were collected, washed free of bacteria, and resuspended at 2 Ã 107 cells/ml in 17 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.1) and then shaken at 180 rpm. Cells were pulsed with cAMP every 7 min at a final concentration of 2 Ã 10â8m beginning at 2 h of development. Alternatively, cells were developed on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips for 12 h as described previously (4Sesaki H. Siu C.-H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 504-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were developed in suspension in 17 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.1). To perturb the actin cytoskeleton or raftlike domains, cells were treated for 30 min with 5 Î¼m latrunculin B (Sigma), 0.001% (w/v) digitonin (S. B. Penick and Co., New York, NY), or 0.0005% (w/v) filipin (Sigma). For detergent extractions, cells were resuspended at 5 Ã 107cells/ml in cold extraction buffer (40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm sodium azide, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.2% (v/v), and the suspension was shaken at 180 rpm for 2 min at 4 Â°C. The samples were centrifuged at 14,500 Ã g for 10 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatants were collected, and the pellets were washed once with cold extraction buffer without detergent. To compare the partitioning of proteins between the fractions, the pellets were resuspended in volumes equivalent to the supernatant, and equal proportions were used for further analysis. For immunoprecipitation, gp80 mAb was added to supernatant fractions resulting from the above protocol and incubated for 1 h at 4 Â°C. Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 5 mg/ml and incubated for 1 h at 4 Â°C. The samples were centrifuged at 1,000 Ã g for 10 s. The supernatants were collected, and the beads were washed three times with cold extraction buffer without detergent. To compare the partitioning of proteins between these fractions, the beads were resuspended in volumes equal to the supernatant, and equal proportions of these samples were used for further analysis. TIFF and Triton-insoluble contact regions were isolated as previously described (31Harris T.J.C. Awrey D.E. Cox B.J. Ravandi A. Tsang A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18640-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended at 5 Ã 107 cells/ml in cold extraction buffer (40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm sodium azide, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.2% (v/v), and the suspension was shaken at 180 rpm for 1 min at 4 Â°C. The insoluble material was collected by centrifugation and washed. For TIFF isolation, the resulting pellet was increased to 45% (w/w) sucrose in 1.5 ml, deposited on a 0.5-ml 60% (w/w) cushion in a centrifuge tube, and overlaid with a step gradient of 1 ml of 20% and 2.5 ml of 38% (w/w) sucrose. The gradients were centrifuged at 120,000 Ã g for 15â17 h at 2 Â°C using a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. TIFF was collected from the interface between 20 and 38% sucrose. The initial steps of the contact region isolation were similar to the TIFF isolation protocol, and the contact regions were isolated from complexes that sedimented to the interface between 45 and 60% sucrose with centrifugation. The material was washed and then dialyzed in a cytoskeleton depolymerizing solution containing 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6 (35Ingalls H.M. Goodloe-Holland C.M. Luna E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4779-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Then the sample was layered on top of a discontinuous gradient of 2.5 ml of 28% and 2.5 ml of 38% (w/w) sucrose in a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 120,000 Ã g for 3 h at 2 Â°C. The contact regions were collected from the interface between 28 and 38% sucrose. The depolymerized cytoskeleton components, released during the contact region isolation protocol after 1 day of dialysis, were collected as supernatant after centrifugation at 14,500 Ã g for 20 min at 2 Â°C. The cytoskeleton samples were concentrated using a Centricon YM10 centrifugal filtration device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for further analysis. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were imaged and quantified using the Fluor-S Max multi-imager system (Bio-Rad). For protein identification by mass spectrometry, silver-stained gel bands were excised, macerated, reduced, alkylated, and then digested with trypsin as previously described (31Harris T.J.C. Awrey D.E. Cox B.J. Ravandi A. Tsang A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18640-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Peptide masses were determined using a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager Elite MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Peptide masses were submitted to the ProFound search engine (available on the World Wide Web) for matches. Search parameters were held constant and included all Dictyostelium proteins in the NCBI nonredundant data bases, tolerance for peptide mass error of 1 Da, and no missed cut sites per peptide. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For lipid analysis, membrane samples were subjected to gas-liquid chromatography as described previously (31Harris T.J.C. Awrey D.E. Cox B.J. Ravandi A. Tsang A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18640-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were collected from suspension cultures and deposited on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips for 10 min. Alternatively, cells were developed on poly-l-lysine-coated for 12 h as described (4Sesaki H. Siu C.-H. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 504-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Then samples were fixed, stained, and mounted on slides. For double staining of gp80 and F-actin, the cells were fixed in 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by 1% (v/v) formaldehyde in ethanol for 5 min at â20 Â°C. They were incubated with gp80 mAb and then Alexa 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at a 1:10 dilution. For double staining of gp80 and ponticulin, the cells were fixed in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde in methanol for 5 min at â20 Â°C and then incubated in gp80 mAb and ponticulin polyclonal antibodies (37Wuestehube L.J. Chia C.P. Luna E.J. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 245-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For staining of gp80 alone, the cells were fixed in methanol for 5 min at â20 Â°C. Samples were incubated with Alexa 488/568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) at 1:300 dilution. Laser-scanning confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope equipped with a Leica TCS SP confocal system. Detection was maintained within the range of the gray scale to prevent signal saturation. The images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software (Mountain View, CA). The maintenance of cell aggregation was assayed by depositing 1 ml of intact aggregates in suspension at â¼2 Ã 107 cells/ml in 17 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.1) in a 50-ml conical tube. The samples were then shaken at 180 rpm for 30 min, and samples were taken for cell counting. Singlets, doublets, and triplets were counted as dissociated cells, and the percentage of cell aggregation was calculated relative to the total number of cells present. Assays for cell reassociation were also performed (38Lam T.Y. Pickering G. Geltosky J. Siu C.-H. Differentiation. 1981; 20: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Additionally, cell dissociation was assessed under high shear force by counting dissociated cells following 30 s of fast shaking with a Vortex Genie 2 at setting 8 (31Harris T.J.C. Awrey D.E. Cox B.J. Ravandi A. Tsang A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18640-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between gp80 and the actin cytoskeleton during cell aggregation, cells were developed on coverslips for 12 h, fixed, and stained for gp80 and F-actin. At noncontact regions of the cell membrane, gp80 staining was low and displayed a more or less even distribution. However, at both initial and mature cell-cell contact regions, extensive areas of strong gp80 staining were observed (Fig. 1 A). For F-actin, strong staining was detected at filopodia emanating from noncontact regions, cellular protrusions mediating initial cell-cell contacts, and smooth membrane interfaces at mature contacts (Fig. 1 B). When compared at noncontact regions, no clear relationship was evident between gp80 and F-actin, since only low levels of gp80 were present at the sites with high levels of F-actin (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, high levels of gp80 and F-action colocalized in cell-cell contact regions, although their distributions lacked complete overlap, especially at initial cell-cell contacts where F-actin-rich protrusions appeared to extend beyond the established contact (Fig. 1 C). Thus, high levels of F-actin alone are not sufficient to organize detectable gp80 complexes at noncontact regions, but rather cell-cell contact is required to instigate their assembly. A biochemical approach was taken to address the involvement of raftlike membranes and gp80 in the establishment of cytoskeleton connections to gp80 adhesion complexes. We have shown previously that TIFF co-fractionates with the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton in a form termed âcontact regionsâ (31Harris T.J.C. Awrey D.E. Cox B.J. Ravandi A. Tsang A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18640-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These complexes are rich in sterols and contain many of the proteins found in TIFF. They also have the morphology of stacked adherent membranes and co-fractionate with the cytoskeleton at 12 h of development but not at the single cell stage at 0 h (35Ingalls H.M. Goodloe-Holland C.M. Luna E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4779-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The contact regions can be released from the cytoskeleton as a low density membrane fraction after the depolymerization of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 2 A). To characterize the cytoskeletal components, the depolymerized complexes were separated from the membranes by centrifugation and then concentrated. The concentration procedure led to polymerization of the fraction into a gel, consistent with the nature of an actin and myosin mixture. After separation by SDS-PAGE, all silver-stained bands were excised and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Actin and components of the myosin II hexamer (myosin II heavy chain, regulatory myosin light chain, and essential myosin light chain) were identified as major species, and components of the Arp 2/3 complex (Arp 3 and p21-Arc) as minor species (Fig. 2 B). Components of the tubulin cytoskeleton were not detected. The data indicate that TIFF interacts with an actin-myosin complex in the contact region fraction. Since the expression of at least three adhesion molecules is induced between 0 and 12 h of development, cells were fractionated at 0, 4, and 8 h to determine which of them contribute to the formation of the detergent-insoluble complexes. TIFF protein displayed a â¼2-fold increase over the time period (Fig. 2 C). For the contact regions, however, only background levels of protein were recovered up to 4 h, a stage at which the EDTA-sensitive adhesion molecules mediate aggregation. At 8 h, recovery of contact regions increased by 10-fold (Fig. 2 D). Since high levels of gp80 were expressed by 8 h, we examined the role of gp80 in the interaction between TIFF and the cytoskeleton by comparing wild-type and gp80-null (csaA â) cells at 12 h of development. The level of TIFF protein was reduced by â¼50% in gp80-null cells relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 2 E). However, protein recovery in the contact region fraction was reduced to background levels in gp80-null cells (Fig. 2 F). Since stable contact regions could only be recovered with the expression of gp80, they probably represent gp80 adhesion complexes. The lower levels of TIFF protein detected in the gp80-null cells could be due partly to the physical absence of gp80, since it is the major protein component of TIFF (31Harris T.J.C. Awrey D.E. Cox B.J. Ravandi A. Tsang A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18640-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Indeed, lipid analyses revealed that similar levels of TIFF lipids were recovered from the wild-type and gp80-null cells (Table I). TIFF isolated from gp80-null cells was highly enriched in sterols. It contained mainly stigmasterol (84%), with lower levels of campesterol (8%) and sitosterol (8%). Similar results were obtained for wild-type cells, consistent with our previous observation (31Harris T.J.C. Awrey D.E. Cox B.J. Ravandi A. Tsang A. Siu C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18640-18648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, similar levels of both ponticulin and actin were expressed in these two cell strains (Fig. 2 G).Table IRecovery of lipids in TIFF isolated from wild-type and csaA â cellsSterolsPhospholipidsmg/10 10 cellsWild type1.401 Â± 0.3080.196 Â± 0.070csaA â1.800 Â± 0.4030.357 Â± 0.058Values represent the mean Â± S.D.

Since ponticulin interacts with the actin cytoskeleton and is a TIFF component, could it mediate interactions between the gp80 adhesion complex and the cytoskeleton? To address this question, we first examined the distribution of gp80 between the Triton X-100-insoluble complexes. Total detergent-insoluble material was separated using single step gradients into TIFF, which floated to a 28/38% sucrose interface, and a Triton-insoluble sedimenting fraction (TISF), which banded at a 45/60% sucrose interface. The TISF contained both the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton and the gp80 adhesion complexes (see Fig. 2 A). To determine whether the partitioning of gp80 complexes into TISF required an intact actin cytoskeleton, cell aggregates were pretreated with latrunculin B (Fig. 3 A). In control samples, both gp80 and ponticulin were evenly distributed between TIFF and TISF, suggesting that about half of the complexes were associated with the cytoskeleton. Actin was mainly detected in TISF and was present at a much lower level in TIFF. Following latrunculin B treatment, both gp80 and ponticulin showed reduced levels in TISF and were predominantly associated with TIFF. The treatment dramatically reduced the level of actin in TISF and eliminated actin from TIFF. To test whether ponticulin mediates the interactions between the gp80 complexes and the actin cytoskeleton, we analyzed wild-type and ponticulin-null (ponA â) cells (Fig. 3 B). In wild-type cells, gp80 and actin displayed distribution patterns similar to the controls described above (see Fig. 3 A). For ponticulin-null cells, however, gp80 was lost from TISF and became predominantly found in TIFF, similar to the results of latrunculin B treatment of wild-type cells. Analyses of actin revealed its complete loss from the TIFF of null cells, suggesting that ponticulin was required for the binding of actin to TIFF. A partial loss of actin was also observed in TISF, but to a lesser extent than that resulting from the latrunculin B treatment, suggesting that the actin cytoskeleton remained largely intact. Taken together, these results suggest that ponticulin is required for the gp80 adhesion complex to establish cytoskeleton connections. Next, we assessed the proportion of total cellular ponticulin that may be involved specifically in the TIFF-cytoske"
