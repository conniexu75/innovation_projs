https://openalex.org/W2017054020,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a 21-residue vasoactive peptide, is produced in vascular endothelial cells from the 38-residue inactive intermediate big endothelin-1 via a specific cleavage at Trp-21-Val-22. The protease that catalyzes the conversion, endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), constitutes a potential regulatory site for the production of the active peptide. We report the identification of ECE-1, a novel membrane-bound neutral metalloprotease that is expressed abundantly in endothelial cells in vivo and is structurally related to neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and Kell blood group protein. When transfected into cultured cells that normally secrete only big ET-1, the ECE-1 cDNA conferred the ability to secrete mature ET-1. In transfected cells, ECE-1 processes endogenously synthesized big ET-1 as well as exogenously supplied big ET-1, which interacts with ECE-1 on the cell surface. ECE-1 may provide a target for pharmacological intervention to alter ET-1 production."
https://openalex.org/W2166731355,"Ste5 is a Zn2+ finger-like protein thought to function before three kinases, Ste11 (a MEKK), Ste7 (a MEK), and Fus3 (a MAPK), in a conserved MAP kinase cascade required for mating in S. cerevisiae. Here, we present evidence that Ste5 forms a multikinase complex that joins these kinases for efficient Fus3 activation. By two-hybrid analysis, Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3 associate with different domains of Ste5, while Kss1, another MAPK, associates with the same domain as Fus3, thus implying that Ste5 simultaneously binds a MEKK, MEK, and MAPK. Ste5 copurifies with Ste11, Fus3, and a hypophosphorylated form of Ste7, and all four proteins cosediment in a glycerol gradient as if in a large complex. Ste5 also increases the amount of Ste11 complexed to Ste7 and Fus3 and is required for Ste11 to function. These results substantiate a novel signal transduction component that physically links multiple kinases within a single cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1980355157,"The environment of secretory proteins undergoing translocation across the ER membrane was determined by incorporating fluorescent probes into nascent chains during translation. Dyes were positioned at various locations across the entire bilayer and inside the ribosome, and in each case the probes were in an aqueous milieu, as shown both by their fluorescence lifetimes and by collisional quenching of their fluorescence by iodide ions introduced into the ER lumen. The nascent chain therefore occupies an aqueous pore that spans the entire membrane. Since the pore is sealed off from the cytoplasm, cotranslational translocation is effected topographically. This pore is not open to the lumen after targeting is completed; it opens only after the nascent chain length reaches about 70 residues."
https://openalex.org/W1996439275,"Removal of polysialic acid (PSA) from N-CAM during the time when chick motoneuron axons are segregating into target-specific fascicles at the base of the limb was previously shown to result in motoneuron projection errors. Here, it is established that these errors are associated with altered growth cone behavior in the plexus. In contrast to control embryos, in which individual axons were observed to exhibit dramatic changes in direction and extensive divergence, axonal trajectories following the removal of PSA were relatively straight. To determine whether enhanced axon-axon fasciculation following PSA removal had prevented growth cones from responding appropriately to guidance cues at the base of the limb, we also examined the role of L1, a major mediator of axon-axon fasciculation in this system. Anti-L1 reversed the effects of PSA removal on both growth cone trajectories and projection errors. These results indicate that PSA plays a permissive role, attenuating axon-axon interactions in the plexus and thereby allowing the axonal reorganization that is essential for the formation of specific motoneuron projections."
https://openalex.org/W2164146401,"The beta subunit is a cytoplasmic component that normalizes the current amplitude, kinetics, and voltage dependence of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Here, we identify a 30 amino acid domain of the beta subunit that is sufficient to induce a stimulation and shift in the voltage dependence of activation of the Ca2+ channel currents. This domain is located at the amino terminus of the second region of high conservation among all beta subunit gene products. Single point mutations within this region on the beta 1b subunit modified or abolished the stimulation of Ca2+ channel currents and the binding of the beta subunit to the alpha 1A subunit. The binding of this domain is also required for the observed changes in kinetics and voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation induced by beta subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1532455743,"Members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family have been implicated in disease states such as arthritis, periodontal disease, and tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Stromelysin 1 (MMP-3) has a broad substrate specificity and participates in the activation of several MMP zymogens. We examined known sequences of MMP-3 cleavage sites in natural peptides and proteins and compared sequence specificities of MMP-3 and interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) in order to design fluorogenic substrates that (i) would be hydrolyzed rapidly by MMP-3, (ii) would discriminate between MMP-3 and MMP-1, and (iii) could be monitored continuously without interference from MMP amino acid residues. Designed substrates were then screened for activity toward MMP-1, gelatinase A (MMP-2), MMP-3, and gelatinase B (MMP-9). The first of these substrates, NFF-1 (Mca-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Lys-(Dnp)-Gly, where Mca is (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl and Dnp is 2,4-dinitrophenyl), was hydrolyzed equally well by MMP-3 and MMP-2 (kcat/Km approximately 11,000 s-1 M-1). MMP-1 had 25% of the activity of MMP-3 toward NFF-1. The second substrate, NFF-2 (Mca-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Tyr-Ala-Nva-Trp-Met-Lys(Dnp)-NH2, where Nva is norvaline), was hydrolyzed 60 times more rapidly by MMP-3 (kcat/Km = 59,400 s-1 M-1) than MMP-1. Unfortunately, NFF-2 showed little discrimination between MMP-3, MMP-2 (kcat/Km = 54,000 s-1 M-1), and MMP-9 (kcat/Km = 55,300 s-1 M-1). The third substrate, NFF-3 (Mca-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Val-Glu-Nva-Trp-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-NH2), was hydrolyzed rapidly by MMP-3 (kcat/Km = 218,000 s-1 M-1) and very slowly by MMP-9 (kcat/Km = 10,100 s-1 M-1), but there was no significant hydrolysis by MMP-1 and MMP-2. NFF-3 is the first documented synthetic substrate hydrolyzed by only certain members of the MMP family and thus has important application for the discrimination of MMP-3 activity from that of other MMPs. Although NFF-3 was designed by assuming that substrate subsites were independent and hence free energy changes derived from single mutation experiments were additive, we found discrepancies between predicted and experimental kcat/Km values, one on the order of 2000-5000. Thus, the design of additional discriminatory MMP substrates may require approaches other than assuming additive free energy changes, such as screening synthetic libraries and consideration of secondary and tertiary structures of substrates and the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1532285380,"PA700 is a 700,000-dalton multisubunit protein that activates multiple proteolytic activities of the 20 S proteasome by a mechanism dependent upon ATP hydrolysis (Ma, C.-P., Vu, J.H., Proske, R.J., Slaughter, C.A., and DeMartino, G.N. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 3539-3547). In order to determine the identities of and structural relationships among the subunits of PA700, individual PA700 subunits were isolated by a combination of reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Seven of the 16 subunits of PA700 so isolated were subjected to solid phase protease digestion followed by reverse phase HPLC. Selected peptides from each protein were sequenced by automated Edman degradation. Comparison of the resulting amino acid sequences with those in current data bases indicated that three of the subunits represented novel proteins, whereas four subunits were homologous to previously describe proteins. Three subunits of the latter group were, in turn, homologous to one another and are members of a large family of proteins containing a consensus sequence for ATP binding. Purified PA700 demonstrated ATPase activity. Treatment of PA700 with alkylating agents, such as N-ethylmaleimide, inhibited with similar kinetics both proteasome activation and ATPase activity, suggesting that these two activities are functionally linked. Thus, PA700 is composed of multiple members of a protein family that may function in the ATP-dependent regulation of proteasome activity."
https://openalex.org/W2104847120,"Diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) inhibits the mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I) on the substrate side of the Fe-S clusters. In the inhibited NADH-supplemented state all of the Fe-S clusters are oxidized, whereas the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum of the protein-bound FMN can be visualized. It is characterized by troughs at 370 and 450 nm and a small increase of absorbance in the 500-700-nm region. DPI probably reacts irreversibly with FMN, because oxidation of FMN is blocked even after its extraction from the enzyme. Inhibition requires preincubation of enzyme in the presence of NADH and DPI. The lower the NADH/NAD+ ratio or the pH, or the higher the NAD+/DPI ratio, the more DPI is required for inhibition. NAD+ and DPI apparently compete for a common site. Both ubiquinone and dichlorophenolindophenol reductase activities are fully blocked by DPI, whereas the ferricyanide reductase activity is inhibited by 75%. Similar results were found with Complex I and two rotenone-insensitive preparations, subcomplex I lambda and the flavoprotein fraction. DPI also inhibits NADH oxidation by bacterial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase-1 (NDH-1) in membranes of Paracoccus denitrificans and Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W2114270476,"Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent non-enzymatic coagulation factor involved in the regulation of activated protein C (APC). In this paper we report an APC-independent anticoagulant function of protein S. We observed an inhibition of prothrombinase activity on endothelial cells and platelets which was half-maximal at physiological concentrations of free protein S in plasma. On endothelial cells, thrombin-cleaved protein S (PSt) as well as protein S in complex with C4b-binding protein (C4BP) inhibited prothrombinase activity to the same extent as protein S did. In solid-phase binding assays, direct binding of protein S and PSt to factor V and factor Va were observed. Protein S-C4BP complex did not bind to factor V or factor Va, implicating that the factor V(a) binding site on protein S is lost by the interaction with C4BP. A direct inhibition of factor Xa activity by protein S was also observed. Incubation of factor Xa with protein S revealed a noncompetitive inhibition of factor Xa by protein S with a Ki of (4.9 +/- 0.8) x 10(-7) M. Both protein S and protein S-C4BP complex were able to inhibit factor Xa to the same extent, whereas PSt had lost its inhibitory activity. This suggests that the conformational change induced by cleavage of the amino-terminal thrombin-sensitive loop results in a loss of a factor Xa binding site on protein S. The inhibitory effect of protein S involves interactions with both factor Va and factor Xa. The interaction of protein S with factor Xa is influenced by cleavage of the thrombin-sensitive loop, whereas C4BP blocks the interaction of protein S with factor Va. Inhibition of the prothrombinase complex by either forms of protein S might be an important mechanism in regulating thrombin generation in blood coagulation. The importance of the APC-independent anticoagulant action of protein S was emphasized by experiments in which the addition of protein S to normal plasma induced a prolongation of clotting time in a dilute activated partial thromboplastin time (dAPTT) assay. Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous protein S by the addition of monoclonal antibodies against protein S to normal plasma, induced a shortening of the clotting time in a dAPTT assay."
https://openalex.org/W1581994384,"NF-kappa B/Rel proteins regulate the inducible expression of many genes in activated monocytes and endothelial cells that contain decameric kappa B and kappa B-like binding sites. In this study, we examined the binding of c-Rel-p65 heterodimers to non-consensus kappa B-like sites from several genes that do not bind prototypic NF-kappa B(p50-p65). c-Rel-p65 heterodimers from both monocytic and endothelial cells bound to the kappa B-like sites in the interleukin-8, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and tissue factor genes but not to a closely related sequence in the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor gene. In contrast, kappa B sites in the endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and Ig kappa genes that match the kappa B consensus, 5'-GGGRNNYYCC-3' (where R indicates A or G, Y indicates C or T, and N indicates any base), bound NF-kappa B(p50-p65). Comparison of the kappa B-like sites indicated that c-Rel-p65 heterodimers bound to a consensus sequence, 5'-HGGARNYYCC-3' (where R indicates A or G, Y indicates C or T, H indicates A, C, or T, and N indicates any base), which differs at position 1 from the kappa B consensus established for binding NF-kappa B(p50-p65) and other members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family. The selective binding of c-Rel-p65 heterodimers to kappa B-like sites in this set of genes may play a central role in regulating inducible gene expression in monocytes and endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1605341148,"The crystal structure of the 32-kDa catalytic domain of the Streptomyces lividans xylanase A was solved by molecular isomorphous replacement methods and subsequently refined at 2.6-A resolution to a conventional crystallographic R factor of 0.21. This is the first successful structure determination of a member of the F family of endo-beta-1,4-D-glycanases. Unlike the recently determined xylanases of the G family (Wakarchuk, W. W., Campbell, R. L., Sung, W. L., Davoodi, J., and Yaguchi, M. (1994) Protein Sci. 3, 467-475), where the catalytic domains have a unique beta-sheet structure, the 32-kDa domain of the S. lividans xylanase A is folded into a complete (alpha/beta)8 barrel, the first such fold observed among beta-1,4-D-glycanases. The active site is located at the carbonyl end of the beta barrel. The crystal structure supports the earlier assignment of Glu-128 and Glu-236 as the catalytic amino acids (Moreau, A., Roberge, M., Manin, C., Shareck, F., Kluepfel, D., and Morosoli, R. (1994) Biochem. J., in press)."
https://openalex.org/W1558984579,"The Le(a) and Le(b) human blood group antigens are synthesized in tissues producing exocrine secretions; they also circulate in plasma, where they are adsorbed by erythrocytes. They are synthesized by two fucosyltransferases, encoded by Lewis (FUT3) and secretor (FUT2) loci. This genetic model has been challenged because some erythrocyte Lewis-negative individuals express Lewis antigens in saliva. To define the molecular basis of this apparent discrepancy, we sequenced FUT3 in Lewis-negative individuals. We identified two single base pair changes. One, termed L1, yields a Leu-20–>Arg substitution in the enzyme's transmembrane domain. When expressed in COS-7 cells, enzyme substrate affinities are essentially identical to those of wild type. However, the mutant enzyme is found at substantially reduced levels in transfected cells. This suggests that the L1 mutation may alter the Golgi membrane anchoring of the enzyme. It was found alone in double dose in 10 of 30 erythrocyte Lewis-negative individuals, nine of whom express Lewis antigens in saliva. Therefore, L1 can account for erythrocyte/saliva-discrepant Lewis typing results. The L2 mutation creates an Ile-356–>Lys change in the enzyme's catalytic domain and inactivates the enzyme. It was found in double dose in 18 of 19 individuals bearing the double erythrocyte and salivary Lewis deficiency and can account for this phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1642097468,"Regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation controls smooth muscle myosin's ability to act as a molecular motor. If thick filament-regulated myosins share a common structural basis for the on-off switch, then the interface between the RLC and essential light chain (ELC) should be as important in smooth muscle myosin as it is for calcium-dependent regulation in molluscan myosin (Xie, X., Harrison, D. H., Schlichting, I., Sweet, R. M., Kalabokis, V. N., Szent-Gyorgyi, A. G., and Cohen, C. (1994) Nature 368, 306-312). To test this hypothesis, a baculovirus expression system was used to obtain a truncated smooth muscle myosin that contained its native RLC and either smooth ELC, skeletal ELC, or no ELC. Movement of actin in a motility assay by heavy meromyosin (HMM) containing either skeletal or smooth ELC occurred at the same rate and in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. In contrast, substitution of skeletal RLC for smooth RLC produced an inactive molecule. HMM without an ELC moved actin at 25% the rate of control HMM, but the movement was phosphorylation-dependent even without an RLC/ELC interface. Poor regulation was observed, however, when the tail was truncated from 72 to 27 nm even though this species was primarily double-headed. These results suggest that the molecular changes induced at the active site by phosphorylation can occur independent of the ELC, but critically depend upon a stable coiled-coil tail that determines how the RLCs interact at the head/rod junction."
https://openalex.org/W2057446275,"A stepwise morphogenetic program of cell division and cell fate determination generates the precise neuronal architecture of the visual centers of the Drosophila brain. Here, we show that the assembly of the target structure for ingrowing retinal axons involves cell-cell interactions mediated by the secreted product of the wingless (wg) gene. wg, expressed in two symmetrical domains of the developing brain, is required to induce and maintain the expression of the secreted decapentaplegic (dpp) gene product in adjacent domains. wg and dpp function are required for target field neurons to adopt their proper fates and to send axons into the developing target structure. These observations implicate a cascade of diffusible signaling molecules in patterning the visual centers of the Drosophila brain."
https://openalex.org/W1601396769,"Heterogeneous N-terminal glycine acylation recently has been reported for two proteins involved in visual signal transduction. Similar N-acylations have typically involved only myristate; however, none of the previously examined proteins were isolated from retinas. To determine whether heterogeneous N-acylation is tissue-specific or protein sequence-specific, the N-terminal modifications of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, partially purified from bovine retinas, heart, and brain tissues, were characterized. Using tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled directly to an electrospray mass spectrometer, we found only myristate at the N termini of catalytic subunits from brain and heart tissue, whereas the N termini of the retina-derived subunits were heterogeneously acylated in a manner similar to recoverin and transducin. Thus it appears that the nature of N-terminal glycine acylation is determined by the cell or tissue type in which it is located, and not by the sequence of the modified protein. We also examined the N-acylation of recoverin purified from human retinas, as well as transducin purified from frog retinas, to determine if heterogeneous acylation of retinal proteins is a uniquely bovine phenomenon. Interestingly, human recoverin was modified by the same family of fatty acids found on the bovine retinal proteins, while frog transducin was modified homogeneously not with myristate, but with a doubly unsaturated (C14:2) fatty acyl group."
https://openalex.org/W1486127885,"Abstract Depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx into rat brain synaptosomes induces dephosphorylation of dephosphin, a 96-94-kDa protein kinase C (PKC) substrate recently identified as dynamin I, a protein associated with endocytosis. We characterized purified dynamin I to better understand regulation of its phosphorylation in nerve terminals. Purified dynamin I possessed a very high affinity for PKC but did not fit Michaelis-Menten kinetics. It had an optimum phosphorylation rate of 1.42 +/- 0.02 mumol/mg/min and a concentration giving half-maximal activity (S0.5) of 0.14 +/- 0.02 microM, the highest affinity reported for a PKC substrate protein. Concentrations of dynamin greater than 0.5 microM inhibited phosphorylation. The stoichiometry was 1.5, indicating more than one phosphorylation site. Dynamin was predominantly associated with the brain particulate fraction under conditions of low ionic strength, and this prevented its phosphorylation by PKC until released by moderate increases in ionic strength (Na+, K+, and Mg2+) or by GTP or ATP. In intact synaptosomes the largest dynamin pool was associated with the particulate fraction, while a smaller pool was cytosolic or extracted with 150 nM NaCl and contained all the phosphorylated protein. Purified dynamin also bound to phospholipid-coated controlled-pore glass beads, but poorly in the presence of NaCl, Mg2+, GTP, or ATP. Ca2+ induced a reversible translocation from the cytosol to the particulate fraction (50% at 183 microM Ca2+) in brain homogenates, and the purified protein also underwent Ca(2+)-sensitive translocation to phospholipid-coated controlled-pore glass beads. We conclude that dynamin I is a nerve terminal Ca(2+)-sensitive phospholipid-binding protein with very high substrate affinity for PKC. We propose that phosphorylation by PKC occurs in the nerve terminal soluble compartment and that Ca2+ may mediate its binding to the particulate fraction, thereby blocking the PKC phosphorylation sites. These properties may contribute to the lack of PKC phosphorylation during depolarization, despite the presence of activated PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1516612405,"A 52-kDa protein was purified from the venom gland of an endoparasitic wasp Chelonus sp. near curvimaculatus. The acidic protein (pl 4.8-5.0) was purified, and the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by direct protein sequencing. A vector-anchored primer and a degenerate primer derived from an 8-amino acid region of the NH2 terminus were used in anchored polymerase chain reaction to generate a probe for screening a cDNA library prepared from mRNA from the venom gland of this wasp. A positive clone of 1596 nucleotides was isolated, sequenced, and found to contain an open reading frame encoding a protein of 483 amino acids. The amino acid sequence encoded in the cDNA clone at the amino terminus was identical to the sequence determined from the purified 52-kDa protein. Comparison of the inferred protein sequence against all of the sequences in the GenBank data base revealed a high degree of similarity to a 62-kDa insect chitinase that is expressed at each molt for the purpose of digesting the chitinous insect cuticle. Two regions that are conserved in a group of chitinases from insects, bacteria and fungi, were also conserved in the wasp 52-kDa protein. The region between amino acid residues 382 and 464 in the 52-kDa wasp chitinase markedly differed in primary sequence from the corresponding region in the 62-kDa insect chitinase, although this region in both the proteins is predicted to have a similar secondary structure predominantly of coils and turns. This region may impart unique structural properties to the 52-kDa chitinase that enables it to exist in an active form in a chitin-lined reservoir without exerting an autotoxic effect to digest the cuticular storage reservoir. Chitinolytic activity occurring in the total venom gland extract was kinetically indistinguishable from that observed for the purified 52-kDa protein, including the substrate concentrations at which maximal velocity and substrate inhibition were reached. The kinetic properties of the 52-kDa wasp chitinase were quite distinct from Serratia marcescens chitinase for both catalytic rate and substrate inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2073869365,"The differentiation of neuronal cell progenitors depends on complex interactions between intrinsic cellular programs and environmental cues. Such interactions have recently been explored using an immortalized sympathoadrenal progenitor cell line, MAH. These studies have revealed that depolarizing conditions, in combination with exposure to FGF, can induce responsiveness to NGF. Here we report that CNTF, which utilizes an intracellular signaling pathway distinct from that of both FGF and NGF, can collaborate with FGF to promote efficiently the differentiation of MAH progenitor cells to a stage remarkably reminiscent of NGF-dependent, postmitotic sympathetic neurons. We also find that similar collaborative interactions can occur during transdifferentiation of normal cultured chromaffin cells into sympathetic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1510622602,"The immediate early gene transcription factor Egr-1 increases luciferase reporter gene activity 3-4-fold when a rat phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) promoter-luciferase construct and an Egr-1 expression construct are cotransfected into transformed PC12 cells (RS1). Egr-1 also stimulates endogenous PNMT mRNA expression in the RS1 cells. Furthermore, when transfected RS1 cells are treated with dexamethasone, both luciferase and endogenous PNMT mRNA rise an additional 2-fold although dexamethasone does not independently activate transcription from the PNMT promoter. While both Egr-1 sites (-45 and -165 base pairs) in the PNMT promoter appear necessary for maximum luciferase reporter gene expression, the -165 site appears to be the more important for mediating the Egr-1 response. When the upstream site is deleted or either or both sites are mutated in PNMT-reporter gene constructs, Egr-1-induced luciferase activity from the PNMT promoter is significantly reduced. In addition, the incremental activation by dexamethasone is lost when sequences containing the glucocorticoid response element are deleted or when the Egr-1 sites are mutated. In the transfected RS1 cells, a rise in nuclear Egr-1 protein accompanies the rise in endogenous PNMT mRNA. Similarly, reserpine-treated rats (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), which show an 8-fold elevation in adrenal PNMT mRNA at 6 h postdrug administration, also show a marked rise in Egr-1 protein in adrenal medullary cell nuclei. These studies provide the first direct evidence that a transcription factor, Egr-1, can activate PNMT gene expression and identify PNMT as a novel target gene for Egr-1. Finally, the incremental enhancement of the Egr-1 response by glucocorticoids suggests a potential interaction between Egr-1 and another transcription factor, the glucocorticoid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1566053716,"An essential role of the conserved Asp74 in the coupling of the type 1 angiotensin II (AII) receptor (AT1) to phospholipase C has already been reported (Bihoreau, C., Monnot, C., Davies, E., Teutsch, B., Bernstein, K. B., Corvol, P., and Clauser, E. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 5133-5137). Moreover, preliminary modeling studies have shown that a spatial proximity exists between Asp74, located in transmembrane domain II, and Tyr292, located in transmembrane domain VII and conserved in many, but not all, G protein-coupled receptors. We mutated Tyr292 into Phe and evaluated the pharmacological and activation characteristics of the mutated receptor (Y292F) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. This receptor possessed unchanged binding properties for agonist or antagonist peptide ligands compared to the wild-type receptor, while its coupling to phospholipase C was severely impaired. Interestingly, competition binding experiments, using 125I-[Sar1]AII as a tracer ligand, showed that the Y292F receptor displayed an increased Ki value for DuP 753, an AT1-specific nonpeptide antagonist and a greatly decreased Ki value for the AT2-specific ligand CGP 42112A. These pharmacological changes are similar to those observed for the previously reported mutation of Asp74 into Asn. This apparently symmetrical role of Asp74 and Tyr292 is consistent with the hypothesis that an interaction between these two amino acids could be a key event in the molecular processes linking AII recognition and AT1 receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1518732132,"We have studied the role of Raf-1 in mitogenesis and cellular transformation induced by G protein-coupled receptors in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the human m1 muscarinic receptor. We have observed that in m1-expressing NIH 3T3 cells, the cholinergic agonist carbachol induces a dose- and time-dependent shift in the electrophoretic mobility of p72Raf-1, equivalent to that observed when using phorbol esters or platelet-derived growth factor as stimulants. Phosphoamino acid analysis of slower mobility forms of p72Raf-1 revealed both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Carbachol potently induced c-Raf activity as judged by its in vitro phosphorylating activity using MEK as a substrate. However, induction of Raf-1 kinase activity by carbachol occurred much earlier than changes in its electrophoretic mobility. Raf-1 kinase activation followed a kinetic similar to that exhibited by an epitope-tagged ERK2 protein when coexpressed in the same cells. Conventional protein kinase C (PKC) inactivation by means of sustained phorbol ester treatment or by a new nontoxic PKC-specific inhibitor, GF 109203X, abolished p72Raf-1 mobility shift induced by carbachol or by phorbol esters. However, c-Raf and ERK2 enzymatic activity in response to carbachol was at least 50-80% PKC-independent. Furthermore, inhibition of PKC failed to affect DNA synthesis or focus formation induced by carbachol in cells expressing m1 receptors. In contrast, cotransfection of NIH 3T3 cells with the Raf-1 dominant negative mutant Raf-301 (K375W) drastically decreased the transforming ability of m1 receptors. Thus, our findings implicate Raf-1 activation in transformation by G protein-coupled receptors. In addition, our data suggest that activation of p72Raf-1 and ERK2 by G protein-coupled receptors involves PKC-independent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1562863707,"Contrasting with earlier immunocytochemical studies of pancreatic islet beta-cells, several recent reports describe polypeptide prohormone processing within the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Such a concern is relevant to beta-cells, wherein cleavage of the connecting polypeptide from soluble proinsulin triggers insulin condensation. Two distinct models describe how hormone condensation might enhance efficiency of storage in secretory granules: sorting for entry into granules would be favored if insulin condensed in the TGN; sorting by retention within granules would be favored if insulin condensed after proinsulin entry into immature granules (IGs). To distinguish these possibilities, we utilized Brefeldin A (BFA) to prevent protein export from the TGN. BFA did not inhibit the activity of proinsulin-processing enzymes, nor did it alter the behavior of the TGN by fractionation on Percoll density gradients. Moreover, BFA did not inhibit constitutive-like protein traffic originating from IGs. However, BFA blocked proinsulin transfer from the TGN to IGs. As long as proinsulin resided in the TGN, conversion to insulin did not occur. Washout of BFA restored granule formation and subsequent insulin production. These data provide biochemical confirmation that the generation of insulin, which is crucial for its passive condensation, occurs with IGs rather than in the TGN."
https://openalex.org/W2058647640,"TrkC receptor isoforms have been identified by cDNA cloning and RT-PCR analysis of embryonic chick brain RNA. An N-terminal truncation motif is missing from the signal sequence and first cysteine cluster of the extracellular domain. Within the cytoplasmic dimain, a kinase truncation motif retains part of the kinase domain, but appeared to lack activity. Finally, a kinase insert (KI) motif introduces a 25 amino acid sequence distinct from the known mammalian inserts. KI receptors, like full-length receptors, were tyrosine phosphorylated in response to NT-3 and mediated the transformation of chick embryo fibroblasts and process outgrowth from rat PC12 cells. However, KI receptors supported little, if any, survival of serum-deprived PC12 cells. These results indicate that alternative splicing of trkC transcripts is an important mechanism for regulating cellular responses to NT-3."
https://openalex.org/W1520054154,"Cells require a constant influx of free fatty acids for lipid resynthesis and metabolic energy. Fatty acids also act as second messengers and modulate channel activities. In the pancreatic beta-cell, fatty acids have both acute and chronic effects on insulin secretion. We show that the addition of fatty acid to pancreatic beta-cells in vitro produces a persistent decrease in intracellular pH, which begins immediately after the addition of fatty acid and has an exponential time course with t1/2 approximately 60 s. The pH drop can be largely reversed by the addition of albumin. The observed pH effect can be explained by passive diffusion (flip-flop) of un-ionized fatty acid across the plasma membrane. Acidification by a fatty acid dimer and alkalinization by an alkylamine also favor the flip-flop mechanism of transport rather than a protein-mediated mechanism. Our method provides for the first time a real-time measurement of fatty acid import into cells. The significant pH change may be important in mediating some of the regulatory effects of fatty acid, such as inhibition of glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1601074958,"An approximately 750-kDa member of the family of giant titin/twitchin-like myosin-associated proteins was highly purified from muscle of the marine mollusc Aplysia californica. Purified twitchin was able to autophosphorylate on threonine, which demonstrates its protein serine/threonine kinase activity. cDNA sequence analysis of the cloned kinase domain of molluscan twitchin revealed that it is most closely related with the kinase domains of Caenorhabditis elegans twitchin (62% identity) and vertebrate myosin light chain kinases (45% average identity). Analysis of the cDNA sequence further suggested the presence of a potential calmodulin-binding site in a putative autoinhibitory region. The functional activity of this site was demonstrated by the calcium-dependent binding of purified twitchin to immobilized calmodulin and the fact that this interaction could be competed with synthetic peptides deduced from the cDNA sequence. Furthermore, biotinylated calmodulin bound to immobilized twitchin in gel-overlay assays with nanomolar affinity (EC50 approximately equal to 70 nM). The potential regulation of twitchin by calcium/calmodulin indicates that titin-like molecules may serve dynamic functions during contraction-relaxation cycles in muscle in addition to their functions as cytoskeletal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1481520424,"Na(+)-dependent glucose transporters (SGLT1) exhibit transient carrier currents with a time constant (tau) of 2-20 ms, and the charge transfer (Q) fits the Boltzmann equation. There is a 60-mV negative displacement in the tau/V and Q/V curves between the human and rabbit SGLT1 proteins, and the initial goal was to identify the charges responsible for these differences in kinetics. We have focused on residue 176 in putative transmembrane helix (M4) because this is an aspartic acid in rabbit and asparagine in human. Asp-176 in rabbit SGLT1 was replaced with asparagine and alanine residues, and the wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. A two-electrode voltage clamp was used to measure the kinetics of charge transfer. There was no difference between the wild-type and D176N, but there was a 60-mV negative shift in the tau/V and Q/V curves with D176A. This suggests that polar residues at position 176 play an important role in determining charge transfer, probably by electrostatic bonding to a neighboring polar residue in the membrane domain of the protein. The similarity between rabbit SGLT1 and the D176N mutant further indicates that other membrane residues account for the difference between rabbit and human SGLT1. There were only modest changes in the steady-state Na+/glucose cotransport kinetics between wild-type and D176A mutant transporters in the voltage range +50 to -50 mV. Model simulations show that the mutation alters the rate constants for conformational changes of the unloaded transporter. Phlorizin, a specific competitive inhibitor of sugar transport, has a lower affinity for the D176A mutant than for SGLT1. This indicates that polar residues at position 176 hydrogen bond with the -OH group on the B-phenyl ring of the inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1640980726,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are highly conserved approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin, and are believed to participate in vesicular transport in both exocytic and endocytic pathways. Based on size, phylogenetic analysis, amino acid sequence, and gene structure, mammalian ARFs fall into three classes (class I, ARFs 1, 2, 3; class II, ARFs 4, 5; class III, ARF6). Two ARF genes (yARF1, yARF2) are known in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and believed to participate in vesicular trafficking in the Golgi system; the double deletion mutant is not viable. A third yeast ARF (yARF3) cDNA has been cloned by polymerase chain reaction-based procedures. It contains an open reading frame of 549 bases encoding a protein of 183 amino acids, with a deduced amino acid sequence more identical (60%) to that of the class III mammalian ARF than to those of the other two classes (52-56%). The yARF3 protein, however, reacted poorly with antibodies against any of the three classes of mammalian ARFs. In the presence of GTP, recombinant yARF3 protein stimulated cholera toxin-catalyzed auto-ADP-ribosylation. yARF3 gene transcription, similar to that of yARF2, was repressed by glucose. As yARF3 was not essential for cell viability and was not required for endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi protein transport, it may provide an opportunity to define an ARF function in another kind of vesicular trafficking."

Using limited proteolysis and chemical degradation, the cross-link site in sigma 70 was mapped to a segment between amino acids Glu508 and Met561 containing the C-terminal part of conserved region 3. This result, when reconciled with genetic data on the interaction of sigma 70 conserved regions 2 and 4 with the -10 and -35 promoter regions, respectively, allows us to model the orientation of the sigma 70 subunit domains within the open promoter complex."
https://openalex.org/W1538077612,"A novel, hydroxyproline-containing neuropeptide, Gly-Pro-Hyp-Tyr-Asp-Phe-Gly-Met-NH2, designated [HYP3]Met-callatostatin, has been identified from extracts of heads of the blowfly Calliphora vomitoria. The peptide is a naturally occurring hydroxylate analogue of Met-callatostatin, a previously identified allatostatin-like peptide, and is present to the extent of 20% of the nonhydroxylated form. In bioassays, both forms of the peptide show allatostatic activity by inhibiting juvenile hormone synthesis and release in the cockroaches Periplaneta americana, Diploptera punctata, and Blattella germanica (IC50 = 100 pM-10 nM). They do not, however, influence juvenile hormone bisepoxide synthesis and release in the blowfly. In flies, [Hyp3]Met-callatostatin inhibits the peristaltic movements of the hindgut, showing a biphasic response (IC50 = 0.5 pM and 0.5 microM) compared with the monophasic response of Met-callatostatin (IC50 = 100 nM). Immunocytochemical studies with Met-callatostatin antisera provide the cytological basis for a myoinhibitory role in the gut since the axons of immunoreactive neurons in the abdominal ganglion project to the ileum. There are also endocrine cells in the midgut that, by releasing the peptides into the hemolymph, would allow the Met-callatostatins to fulfill a neurohormonal role on muscles of the gut and heart. In contrast, there are no Met-callatostatin neural pathways from the brain to the corpus allatum, the gland that produces juvenile hormone. NH2-terminal degradation of Met-callatostatins incubated with the hemolymph of P. americana results in cleavage of the Pro-Tyr bond giving the pentapeptide Tyr-Asp-Phe-Gly-Met-NH2 as a degradation product. In contrast, the Hyp-Tyr bond resists cleavage. With hemolymph from C. vomitoria, no immunoassayable degradation product has been observed with either peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1502389462,"Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is used as a thrombolytic agent in treatment of myocardial infarction. However, large doses of this agent must be administered in treatment to maintain a thrombolytic state because t-PA is cleared rapidly from circulation. We designed specific ligands to distinguish between two major mechanisms by which t-PA is taken into cells and degraded. One of these mechanisms involves internalization of complexes between t-PA and its cognate inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1); the other mechanism is independent of PAI-1. Using specific inhibitors for low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP), we show that the degradation by hepatocytes of both free t-PA and t-PA.PAI-1 complexes involve the receptor LRP. We demonstrate that fibroblasts degrade both free t-PA (PAI-1-independent) and t-PA complexed with its specific inhibitor PAI-1 (PAI-1-dependent), whereas genetically altered fibroblasts that do not express LRP neither internalize nor degrade these ligands. We also show that a PAI-1-independent, t-PA ligand can inhibit the degradation of both free t-PA and t-PA.PAI-1 complexes. We propose LRP is the receptor for both PAI-1-independent and PAI-1-dependent t-PA ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1526102413,"Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to isolate 19 independent, temperature-sensitive, low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants that define three recessive complementation groups, ldlE, ldlF, ldlG. LDL receptor activity, essentially normal at the permissive temperature (34 degrees C), was virtually abolished in the mutants after incubation for 8-12 h at the nonpermissive temperature (39-40.5 degrees C). The mutants died after incubation for > 24 h at 39.5 degrees C. These mutants exhibited two striking and unexpected abnormalities that suggest that they define three genes important for general vesicular membrane traffic. First, LDL receptors were degraded abnormally rapidly at the nonpermissive temperature (chloroquine inhibited this degradation in ldlE and ldlG, but not in ldlF). In ldlE cells, the rapid degradation did not require efficient receptor clustering into coated pits and was not observed for all cell surface proteins. This selective degradation may be due to endocytic missorting. Second, the mutants exhibited temperature-sensitive defects in the posttranslational processing and intracellular transport of many membrane-associated and secreted proteins, including the LDL, mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II, and scavenger receptors, the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and decay accelerating factor. Although the initial synthesis, folding, and processing of precursor forms of these proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum were apparently normal at the nonpermissive temperature, there was either a delay or a block in oligosaccharide processing associated with endoplasmic reticulum to medial Golgi transport at the nonpermissive temperature. This was accompanied by a dramatic inhibition of total soluble protein secretion. The posttranslational processing defects, the instability of cell surface LDL receptors, and the defective protein secretion exhibited by these mutants suggest that the ldlE-G gene products regulate or participate in reactions that are vital for a variety of secretory and endocytic membrane transport processes. This suggestion is strongly supported by our recent observation that a cDNA encoding a component of the coatomer, epsilon-COP, corrects the mutant phenotypes of ldlF cells (Guo, Q., Vasile, E., and Krieger, M. (1994) J. Cell Biol. 125, 1213-1224). Thus, these mutant cells should prove useful for further genetic and biochemical analysis of the mechanisms underlying intracellular membrane traffic."
https://openalex.org/W1533803597,"Twitchin is a 753-kDa polypeptide located in the muscle A-bands of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. It consists of multiple copies of both fibronectin III and immunoglobulin C2 domains and, near the C terminus, a protein kinase domain with greatest homology to the catalytic domains of myosin light chain kinases. We have expressed and purified from Escherichia coli twitchin's protein kinase catalytic core and flanking sequences that do not include fibronectin III and immunoglobulin C2 domains. The protein was shown to phosphorylate a model substrate and to undergo autophosphorylation. The autophosphorylation occurs at a slow rate, attaining a maximum at 3 h with a stoichiometry of about 1.0 mol of phosphate/mol of protein, probably through an intramolecular mechanism. Sequence analysis of proteolytically derived phosphopeptides revealed that autophosphorylation occurred N-terminal to the catalytic core, predominantly at Thr-5910, with possible minor sites at Ser5912 and/or Ser-5913. This portion of twitchin (residues 5890-6268) was also phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase C in the absence of calcium and phosphotidylserine, but not by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. By comparing the activities of three twitchin segments, the enzyme appears to be inhibited by the 60-amino acid residues lying just C-terminal to the kinase catalytic core. Thus, like a number of other protein kinases including myosin light chain kinases, the twitchin kinase appears to be autoregulated."
https://openalex.org/W1594855315,"Ras proteins appear to have two distinct downstream effectors, adenylyl cyclase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a product of raf-1 protooncogene in higher organisms. We found that in vitro activation of adenylyl cyclase by yeast Ras2 and human H-Ras proteins is subject to competitive inhibition by its leucine-rich repeats domain and by the N-terminal regulatory domain of human Raf-1 protein. Kinetic analyses of the inhibition patterns enabled us to determine exact dissociation constants (Kd) of the two polypeptides for Ras2 and H-Ras. The leucine-rich repeats domain bound to the posttranslationally modified Ras2 with the Kd of approximately 13 nM, which was close to the value (7 nM) of the whole adenylyl cyclase. The Kd of Raf-1 for the modified H-Ras, 3.5 nM, was significantly lower than that for Ras2, 24 nM, whereas adenylyl cyclase bound preferentially to Ras2. Similar inhibition was also observed in vivo by suppression of RAS2Val-19-dependent heat shock sensitivity and of Ras-dependent cAMP response to glucose upon overexpression of Raf-1 in yeast. These results indicate that the leucine-rich repeats domain contains the Ras protein-binding site and that Raf-1 and adenylyl cyclase, sharing no structural homology with each other, bind to a similar, if not identical, region of Ras with comparable affinities."

Because cells expressing several mutant enzymes missing portions of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the wild-type enzyme were previously found to exhibit amsacrine resistance, a carboxyl-terminal truncation protein Top2(1-1166), which lacks the last 263 amino acids of the wild-type enzyme, was also overexpressed and purified. These purified enzymes were used in the measurement of the turnover numbers of the DNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP, the transport of one DNA segment through another, and the effects of amsacrine, teniposide or Ca(II) on the formation of the enzyme-DNA covalent intermediate. The results of these studies indicate that mutations leading to cellular resistance to amsacrine may occur by several different mechanisms, including reduction of the nuclear concentration and attenuation of the intrinsic catalytic steps of the enzyme. The significance of this underpinning mechanistic diversity of drug resistance and its relation to the simultaneous development of cellular resistance to chemically distinct drugs that target DNA topoisomerase II are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1518555736,"The VFe protein of alternative nitrogenase, isolated from Azotobacter vinelandii, strain LS15 and designated as Av1', has been investigated by Mossbauer spectroscopy. The Mossbauer spectrum of the dithionite-reduced Av1', recorded at 4.2 K with a 60-millitesla magnetic field applied parallel to the gamma-beam, is a superposition of three spectral components: 1) a complex spectrum (the M component) with magnetic hyperfine structures attributed to the paramagnetic FeV cofactor, 2) a component (the P component) consisting of three quadrupole doublets identifiable as the Fe2+, D, and S doublets similar to those observed for the P cluster pairs in MoFe proteins, and 3) a minor (4% of total absorption) quadrupole doublet attributable to adventitiously bound iron. The observed 4.2-K parameters for the Fe2+ (delta EQ = 2.99 mm/s and delta = 0.64 mm/s), D (delta EQ = 0.75 mm/s and delta = 0.63 mm/s), and S (delta EQ = 1.2 mm/s and delta = 0.65 mm/s) iron sites and their temperature dependence are very similar to those observed for the P cluster pairs in the conventional MoFe proteins. Similar to those of the MoFe protein, strong field spectra indicate that these doublets are associated with a diamagnetic system. Their percent absorption intensities (Fe(2+)/D/S = 13.0:32.2:6.8) determined at 4.2 K after the removal of the contributions from the adventitiously bound iron are comparable to those of the P cluster pairs in MoFe proteins. These observations established that Av1' also contains P cluster pairs that are identical, in both composition and quantity, to those of the MoFe proteins; i.e. each molecule contains two P cluster pairs and each pair is formed by two Fe2+, five D, and one S iron sites. Considering that 52% absorption of the P component corresponding to two 8Fe clusters, the remaining 48% absorption determined for the M component is consistent with two 7Fe-containing FeV cofactors/molecule of Av1'. The fact that both P cluster pairs are found in the diamagnetic states implies that the S = 3/2 and S = 1/2 signals detected in earlier EPR measurements are associated with the FeV cofactor and suggests a spin mixture for the FeV cofactor in the dithionite-reduced Av1'."
https://openalex.org/W2018940368,"A direct role for neurons in CNS myelination has yet to be demonstrated. CNS myelination can be examined in cerebellar slice cultures, which faithfully reproduce both synthesis and wrapping of myelin. In an attempt to demonstrate a role for axolemma in this process, we generated more than 2000 axolemma-reactive monoclonal antibodies. One clone, G21.3, repeatedly blocked myelination in cerebellar slices, as documented by both biochemistry and morphology. The antibody caused a dramatic reduction in myelin lipid and protein synthesis. CNS white matter, sciatic nerve, and neuronal cultures were positively stained with G21.3, whereas oligodendrocytes and myelin were fully negative. The antibody identified a restricted number of proteins in purified axolemma. These results suggest a direct involvement of axons in CNS myelination."
https://openalex.org/W1517818296,"Rapid, transient induction of c-fos transcription follows treatment of cells with insulin and other growth factors. This is mediated through the serum response element (SRE), which binds the serum response factor (SRF), as well as accessory factors such as p62 ternary complex factor. Using a gel shift assay we found that formation of the ternary complex increased transiently within 2 min of insulin or phorbol ester treatment of several insulin-sensitive cell lines. However, mutations that prevented formation of this ternary complex did not inhibit insulin- or phorbol ester-stimulated induction of c-fos transcription in these cell lines. We also identified a novel SRF-containing multiprotein complex that forms on the SRE within 2 min following insulin, phorbol ester, or other growth factor treatment. Formation of this novel complex, called band 3, occurred rapidly and transiently, with a time course parallel to the induction of c-fos transcription. Band 3 also formed with gamma-actin and zif268/3 SRE probes. Methylation and carboxy ethylation interference analysis, as well as extensive SRE mutagenesis, suggest that only the SRF directly contacts the SRE in forming band 3. Formation of this novel complex appears to involve protein-protein interactions between SRF and other nuclear protein(s) that may play a role in growth factor stimulation of c-fos transcription."

Northern analysis indicates that this transcript is synthesized rapidly in the dark, but upon 20 min of illumination, transcript levels fall below detectable limits. An open reading frame was located 378 bases from the start of the transcript which encodes a 21-kDa protein with significant homology to two hitherto different proteins. The protein sequence LrtA showed 37% sequence identity and 58% sequence similarity to the chloroplast-specific small subunit ribosomal protein, S30, and 37% sequence identity and 60% sequence identity and 60% sequence similarity to the reported transcription modulator protein of sigma 54 found in Klebsiella pneumonia and Azotobacter vinelandii. Expression of the lrtA gene product is not detectable within 1 h after placing the cells in the dark, however, within 2.5 min of illumination, [35S]methionine incorporated into a 21-kDa protein. To a lessor extent, [35S]methionine incorporation into a 17- and a 14-kDa protein was also seen which was followed by two other recognizable waves of translation at 5 and 10 min. This incorporation was not blocked by rifampicin added to dark-adapted cells prior to illumination. [35S]Methionine pulsed-labeling experiments suggested that the translation of lrtA occurred only during the first 10 min of reillumination of dark-adapted cells. The loss of initial [35S]methionine labeling in the light of the 21-kDa protein in a kanamycin-interrupted lrtA gene mutant suggests that the lrtA codes for the 21-kDa protein."
https://openalex.org/W1582543472,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CPT1 and EPT1 genes represent structural genes that encode distinct choline- and choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferases, respectively. To explore the function of linear segments of these enzymes, a series of 14 EPT1-CPT1 chimeric gene constructs and the parental wild-type genes were expressed in a cpt1 ept1 double null mutant background completely devoid of phosphoamino alcohol transferase activity. Eleven of the chimeric genes expressed functional enzymes. The CDP-amino alcohol and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) substrate specificities and essential phospholipid cofactor requirements of the parental and chimeric enzymes were investigated using a mixed micellar assay system. Chimeric enzymes exhibited a pattern of CDP-amino alcohol affinities that defined a structural domain sufficient to confer CDP-amino alcohol specificity. When wild-type enzymes were investigated using a chemically defined series of DAGs, each possessed a distinct characteristic pattern of utilization. Chimeric enzymes exhibited DAG acyl chain specificity profiles that either conformed to parental wild-type patterns or represented novel substrate specificities. Correlation of these outcomes with their underlying structural modifications permitted the assignment of an internal, linear region of 218 amino acids sufficient to confer DAG acyl chain specificity; this region contained three predicted transmembrane segments. Neither wild-type enzyme showed significant acyl chain selectivity with respect to phospholipid activation when a homologous series of chemically defined phosphatidylcholines were employed, suggesting that enzyme recognition of the fatty acyl moieties of the DAG substrate and phospholipid activator is fundamentally different. Analysis of chimeric enzymes dependence on phospholipid activators suggested the involvement of discontinuous protein segments participating in the interaction with phospholipid cofactors."

In this report, the electronic, magnetic, and vibrational properties of the [2Fe-2S]2+,+ center have been investigated by the combination of absorption, circular dichroism, variable-temperature magnetic circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopies and compared with a range of simple [2Fe-2S]-containing proteins. The results are consistent with coordination by two cysteinyl residues at both the reducible and nonreducible iron sites and reveal a striking similarity between the properties of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in the P. denitrificans NDH-1 25-kDa subunit and those of the subclass of ferredoxin-type [2Fe-2S] centers typified by Clostridium pasteurianum 2Fe ferredoxin.

A single polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 42-kDa cofractionates with both 5S DNA binding and 5S transcription activities, and was conclusively identified as human TFIIIA by its ability to direct specific 5S gene transcription in vitro following elution and renaturation from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The DNase I protection pattern of the purified human factor on a human 5S gene is similar to the pattern previously observed with Xenopus TFIIIA. A Xenopus 5S gene, but not a yeast 5S gene, is able to effectively compete for binding of the human factor. In addition, we report a previously undetected immunological cross-reactivity between human and Xenopus TFIIIA. hTFIIIA is recognized specifically both by polyclonal antisera raised against Xenopus laevis TFIIIA as well as by a monoclonal antibody generated against the amphibian protein. These observations indicate that human TFIIIA is structurally related to the Xenopus oocyte factor and that the previous inability to detect human TFIIIA by immunological methods is due primarily to the low abundance of this factor in HeLa cell extracts."

The sequences shared extensive identity except for a 333-base pair (bp) Alu repeat present only in human BCHE. One single transcription start site was found in both genes with the techniques of primer extension, amplification of the 5'-end of mRNA, and RNase protection. Cap sites in human and rabbit BCHE genes were found in strictly homologous positions. In human BCHE, the transcription start site was found 157 bp upstream of Met-28, the translation start site. Potential regulatory elements in both promoters included one AP1 site and multiple sites for topoisomerase, Oct-1 and PEA-3. Transient expression of BCHE-reporter gene constructs showed that a 194-bp fragment of the 5'-flanking region of human BCHE and a 570-bp fragment of rabbit BCHE were sufficient for promoting chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in HeLa cells. No consensus TATA and CAAT boxes were found.

G alpha 2 is transiently phosphorylated on a serine residue(s) following stimulation with extracellular cAMP (Gundersen, R. E., and Devreotes, P.N. (1990) Science 248, 591-593). To aid in defining the function of alpha-subunit phosphorylation, we identified the site of G alpha 2 phosphorylation. Comparison of the isoelectric points (pI) of the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms indicated that a single mole of phosphate is added to G alpha 2. Cleavage at tryptophan residues and immunoprecipitation with a specific peptide antibody localized the phosphorylated serine in the N-terminal 119 residues. Analysis of a series of G alpha 1 and G alpha 2 chimeras further confined the site between amino acids 33 and 215. Site-directed mutagenesis of serines between amino acids 33 and 119 produced two mutants that were not phosphorylated, S45A and S113A. Ser113 was identified as the site by sequential Edman degradation of 32P-radiolabeled G alpha 2 digested with endoproteinase Glu-C. We have expressed the G alpha 2 mutants S113A, S113I, S113T, and S113D in a G alpha 2 null cell line to examine the function of phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1549116139,"The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor USF43 binds to E box motifs on certain promoters and enhancers, as well as the beta-globin locus control region. We have used gel filtration chromatography, velocity centrifugation, and chemical cross-linking methods to investigate the stoichiometry and shape of USF43 in solution and when bound to DNA. USF43 has a very large Stokes' radius (44 A) and a high frictional ratio (1.64), consistent with an asymmetric elongated oligomer. Under a variety of conditions, the only detectable USF43 species in solution and bound to DNA is a dimer. The carboxyl-terminal leucine zipper is absolutely essential for a stable dimer but not for the elongated conformation. We used a protease footprinting assay to demonstrate that, when USF43 binds to DNA, a approximately 15-kDa USF43 domain becomes resistant to cleavage with trypsin. This domain includes sequences that are not expected to interact with the DNA helix, suggesting that trypsin cleavage sites are masked by a conformational change. Our results show that the oligomerization state of USF43 does not change upon binding to DNA, and the helix-loop-helix oligomerization motif of USF43 is not itself sufficient to form a high affinity dimerization interface."
https://openalex.org/W1922688793,"The relationship of yeast metallothionein (MT) and (gamma EC)nG isopeptides (phytochelatins) in metal ion buffering was assessed. The effect of constitutive expression of yeast metallothionein (MT) genes on accumulation of metal-(gamma EC)nG isopeptide (phytochelatin) complexes was analyzed in Candida glabrata and Schizosaccharomyces pombe cultures incubated in the presence of cadmium salts. Constitutive expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae MT (CUP1) gene inhibited the accumulation of metal-phytochelatin complexes in both C. glabrata and S. pombe. Intracellular Cd(II) sequestration occurred by formation of CdMT complexes. Phytochelatin (gamma EC)nG complexes appear to function in metal buffering in cells when MT genes are not present or expressed. A third condition in which metal-(gamma EC)nG complexes are observed is when constitutively expressed MT does not accumulate. We observed that C. glabrata lacking the AMT1 gene necessary for copper induction of the MT genes expressed MTII constitutively, but this expression does not lead to CdMTII accumulation. Only Cd-(gamma EC)nG complexes accumulate. Likewise, metal exposed cultures of S. cerevisiae (cup1) transformed with C. glabrata MTII under the constitutive ADH1 promoter resulted in constitutive expression of MTII and accumulation of CuMTII complexes but no CdMTII complexes. The inability of constitutively expressed C. glabrata MTII to buffer Cd(II) ions may arise in part from an inherent kinetic lability of CdMTII complexes. Incubation of ZnMTII with a metallochromic chelator, 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol resulted in greater Zn(II) loss than Zn(II) complexes with CUP1 MT and C. glabrata MTI. C. glabrata MTII appears to be the first MT described which forms an unstable Cd(II) complex."
https://openalex.org/W1523445617,The spatial relationship between the polymerase and exonuclease active sites of bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase enzyme has been examined using a bulky biotin-streptavidin block at a specified position in an oligonucleotide (Fig. 1). The idea was to monitor the closest distance of approach of the T4 enzyme before being blocked by the bulky biotin-streptavidin complex while performing either of its activities. The results indicated a distance of 4-5 nucleotides between the biotin-streptavidin probe and the exonuclease site and a distance requirement of at least 7 nucleotides between the bulky probe and the 3'-primer terminus for efficient polymerization by the T4 enzyme. The difference in the two distances suggested a separation of 2-3 nucleotides between the two active sites of the T4 enzyme.

The conformation of the synthetic peptides were analyzed in organic and membrane (bilayer) environments. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that both segments adopt structures with significant alpha-helical content in a hydrophobic environment. For the LP1 peptide, the helical content was maximal with 60% trifluoroethanol, whereas 20% trifluoroethanol maximized the helix content for the LP2 peptide. The interaction of several NH2-terminal peptides with a lipid bilayer was determined by reconstitution of these peptides into lipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. Both the LP1 and LP2 peptides bound strongly to the defined lipid vesicles, but peptides corresponding to residues 1-15 and 33-36 were not incorporated into the lipid vesicles. The results indicate that TXAS has two distinct membrane-anchor segments, comprising residues 16-33 and 37-60 in its NH2-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W1517584908,"Single-stranded circular DNA, containing the SV40 origin sequence, was used as a template for complementary DNA strand synthesis in cytosolic extracts from HeLa cells. In the presence of the replication-dependent chromatin assembly factor CAF-1, defined numbers of nucleosomes were assembled during complementary DNA strand synthesis. These minichromosomes were then induced to semiconservatively replicate by the addition of the SV40 initiator protein T antigen (re-replication). The results indicate that re-replication of minichromosomes appears to be inhibited by two independent mechanisms. One acts at the initiation of minichromosome re-replication, and the other affects replicative chain elongation. To directly demonstrate the inhibitory effect of replicatively assembled nucleosomes, two types of minichromosomes were prepared: (i) post-replicative minichromosomes were assembled in a reaction coupled to replication as above; (ii) pre-replicative minichromosomes were assembled independently of replication on double-stranded DNA. Both types of minichromosomes were used as templates for DNA replication under identical conditions. Replicative fork movement was found to be impeded only on post-replicative minichromosome templates. In contrast, pre-replicative minichromosomes allowed one unconstrained replication cycle, but re-replication was inhibited due to a block in fork movement. Thus, replicatively assembled chromatin may have a profound influence on the re-replication of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1544637792,"Two soluble vacuolar lectins, seed lectin and DB58, from the legume, Dolichos biflorus, were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using both low and high copy number plasmids under the control of the GAL1 promoter. When expressed at low levels, these lectins were each secreted by the yeast at all stages of growth. Expression of the lectins at high levels resulted in the retention of most of the lectins in the cell. Cell fractionation studies showed that this retained lectin was not associated with the yeast vacuoles. The differential COOH-terminal processing of these lectins, that results in the production of heteroligomers in plants, did not occur in yeast. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to produce a construct encoding the shorter subunit of the seed lectin. Expression of this truncated subunit in yeast produced the same results as found with the larger subunit, thus indicating that this modification does not provide the vacuolar targeting signal. The inability of these two vacuolar proteins from different plant tissues to be transported to the yeast vacuole suggests that plants and yeast utilize different signals for targeting soluble vacuolar proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1571009547,"We recently characterized a decapeptide sequence (residues 367-376) that is important for the membrane association of the activated alpha subunit of Gs. We report here that when this sequence is replaced by the cognate sequence of Gi1 alpha subunit, the chimeric protein (Gsis alpha) still interacts with the membrane but cannot be activated, regardless of the mode of activation. Construction of various chimeras demonstrates that the single replacement of valine 367 by threonine, the cognate residue of Gi1 alpha subunit, fully reproduces the loss of activation. Analysis of nucleotide interaction reveals that the mutant V367T Gs alpha protein poorly binds GDP or GTP. On the other hand, the conservative change of valine to isoleucine does not alter activation. Interestingly, members of the Gs and G12 classes have a valine and an isoleucine, respectively, at this position, whereas members of the Gi or Gq class contain a threonine residue. The evolutionary relationship between the different classes suggests that the presence of a hydrophobic or a hydrophilic residue is not fortuitous in these alpha subunits and might provide distinctive structural and/or functional properties."
