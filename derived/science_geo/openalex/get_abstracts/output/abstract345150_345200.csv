https://openalex.org/W1998694942,"The U.S. annual biomass production for food, lumber, paper, and fiber, if used exclusively for energy, would provide 25 percent of current energy requirements. The collection of unharvested wood residues and cull trees for direct use as fuel for small nearby space-heating applications—especially for peak winter conditions—is an important near-term solar energy opportunity. Improved management of hundreds of millions of acres of productive forest land is an important opportunity for the long term. Harvest of cropland residues for energy values, new biomass production using intensive short-rotation silviculture, resubstitution of natural products for petroleum-based synthetics, and forest management for large-scale production of electricity and synthetic fuels are judged to be less appropriate directions for the U.S. energy system to take."
https://openalex.org/W2004586190,The measured voltage derivative of the nonlinear resistance of tiny point contacts can be separated into a phonon-emission effect (alpha(2)F) and an analytic functional form (background effect). The alpha(2)F's show structure coincident with bulk phonon densities of states. Values of the integral of 2 alpha(2)F/omega are closely related to literature values. The background effect is related to the impurity concentration of the materials.

The fluctuations are subsurface but are manifested as baroclinic eddies at the sea surface. These eddies are confirmed by direct observations and supported by theoretical considerations. The eddies cause small-scale variability in the currents and hydrographic structures in this area, and they should be considered in any sampling programs of the region."
