In addition to the receptor binding domain (RBD), S1 has an N-terminal domain (NTD). In searching for neutralizing antibodies, there has been a focus on the RBD. Chi et al. isolated antibodies from 10 convalescent patients and identified an antibody that potently neutralizes the virus but does not bind the RBD. Cryo–electron microscopy revealed the epitope as the NTD. This NTD-targeting antibody may be useful to combine with RBD-targeting antibodies in therapeutic cocktails. Science , this issue p. 650"
https://openalex.org/W3036482641,"Approximately 17 years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic, the world is currently facing the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to the most optimistic projections, it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, so the best short-term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule-based interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) to control the relative expression of their proteins. Previous analyses of SARS-CoV have revealed that it employs a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot that stimulates high -1 PRF rates and that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity impairs virus replication, suggesting that this activity may be therapeutically targeted. Here, we comparatively analyzed the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar -1 PRF rates and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablate -1 PRF activity. We noted that the upstream attenuator hairpin activity is also functionally retained in both viruses, despite differences in the primary sequence in this region. Small-angle X-ray scattering analyses indicated that the pseudoknots in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have the same conformation. Finally, a small molecule previously shown to bind the SARS-CoV pseudoknot and inhibit -1 PRF was similarly effective against -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that such frameshift inhibitors may be promising lead compounds to combat the current COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3036918913,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious retinal disease and is considered as a leading cause of blindness in the world. Ophthalmologists use optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus photography for the purpose of assessing the retinal thickness, and structure, in addition to detecting edema, hemorrhage, and scars. Deep learning models are mainly used to analyze OCT or fundus images, extract unique features for each stage of DR and therefore classify images and stage the disease. Throughout this paper, a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 18 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers is proposed to analyze fundus images and automatically distinguish between controls (i.e. no DR), moderate DR (i.e. a combination of mild and moderate Non Proliferative DR (NPDR)) and severe DR (i.e. a group of severe NPDR, and Proliferative DR (PDR)) with a validation accuracy of 88%-89%, a sensitivity of 87%-89%, a specificity of 94%-95%, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa Score of 0.91-0.92 when both 5-fold, and 10-fold cross validation methods were used respectively. A prior pre-processing stage was deployed where image resizing and a class-specific data augmentation were used. The proposed approach is considerably accurate in objectively diagnosing and grading diabetic retinopathy, which obviates the need for a retina specialist and expands access to retinal care. This technology enables both early diagnosis and objective tracking of disease progression which may help optimize medical therapy to minimize vision loss."
https://openalex.org/W3036889201,"Cell shape is controlled by the submembranous cortex, an actomyosin network mainly generated by two actin nucleators: the Arp2/3 complex and the formin mDia1. Changes in relative nucleator activity may alter cortical organization, mechanics and cell shape. Here we investigate how nucleation-promoting factors mediate interactions between nucleators. In vitro, the nucleation-promoting factor SPIN90 promotes formation of unbranched filaments by Arp2/3, a process thought to provide the initial filament for generation of dendritic networks. Paradoxically, in cells, SPIN90 appears to favour a formin-dominated cortex. Our in vitro experiments reveal that this feature stems mainly from two mechanisms: efficient recruitment of mDia1 to SPIN90–Arp2/3 nucleated filaments and formation of a ternary SPIN90–Arp2/3–mDia1 complex that greatly enhances filament nucleation. Both mechanisms yield rapidly elongating filaments with mDia1 at their barbed ends and SPIN90–Arp2/3 at their pointed ends. Thus, in networks, SPIN90 lowers branching densities and increases the proportion of long filaments elongated by mDia1. Cao et al. show that SPIN90 enhances formation of Arp2/3-mediated unbranched filaments and promotes a formin-based cortex by recruiting mDia1 or forming a ternary SPIN90–Arp2/3–mDia1 complex."
https://openalex.org/W3036890146,"Mucoromycota fungi possess a versatile metabolism and can utilize various substrates for production of industrially important products, such as lipids, chitin/chitosan, polyphosphates, pigments, alcohols and organic acids. However, as far as commercialisation is concerned, establishing industrial biotechnological processes based on Mucoromycota fungi is still challenging due to the high production costs compared to the final product value. Therefore, the development of co-production concept is highly desired since more than one valuable product could be produced at the time and the process has a potentially higher viability. To develop such biotechnological strategy, we applied a high throughput approach consisting of micro-titre cultivation and FTIR spectroscopy. This approach allows single-step biochemical fingerprinting of either fungal biomass or growth media without tedious extraction of metabolites. The influence of two types of nitrogen sources and different levels of inorganic phosphorus on the co-production of lipids, chitin/chitosan and polyphosphates for nine different oleaginous Mucoromycota fungi was evaluated. FTIR analysis of biochemical composition of Mucoromycota fungi and biomass yield showed that variation in inorganic phosphorus had higher effect when inorganic nitrogen source–ammonium sulphate–was used. It was observed that: (1) Umbelopsis vinacea reached almost double biomass yield compared to other strains when yeast extract was used as nitrogen source while phosphorus limitation had little effect on the biomass yield; (2) Mucor circinelloides, Rhizopus stolonifer, Amylomyces rouxii, Absidia glauca and Lichtheimia corymbifera overproduced chitin/chitosan under the low pH caused by the limitation of inorganic phosphorus; (3) Mucor circinelloides, Amylomyces rouxii, Rhizopus stolonifer and Absidia glauca were able to store polyphosphates in addition to lipids when high concentration of inorganic phosphorus was used; (4) the biomass and lipid yield of high-value lipid producers Mortierella alpina and Mortierella hyalina were significantly increased when high concentrations of inorganic phosphorus were combined with ammonium sulphate, while the same amount of inorganic phosphorus combined with yeast extract showed negative impact on the growth and lipid accumulation. FTIR spectroscopy revealed the co-production potential of several oleaginous Mucoromycota fungi forming lipids, chitin/chitosan and polyphosphates in a single cultivation process."
https://openalex.org/W3036373820,"Despite years of research investigating osteoblast differentiation, the mechanisms by which transcription factors regulate osteoblast maturation, bone formation, and bone homeostasis is still unclear. It has been reported that runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) is expressed in osteoblast progenitors, pre-osteoblasts, and mature osteoblasts; yet, surprisingly, the exact function of RUNX1 in osteoblast maturation and bone formation remains unknown. Here, we generated and characterized a pre-osteoblast and differentiating chondrocyte-specific Runx1 conditional knockout mouse model to study RUNX1's function in bone formation. Runx1 ablation in osteoblast precursors and differentiating chondrocytes via osterix-Cre (Osx-Cre) resulted in an osteoporotic phenotype and decreased bone density in the long bones and skulls of Runx1f/fOsx-Cre mice compared with Runx1f/f and Osx-Cre mice. RUNX1 deficiency reduced the expression of SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), Indian hedgehog signaling molecule (IHH), Patched (PTC), and cyclin D1 in the growth plate, and also reduced the expression of osteocalcin (OCN), OSX, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and RUNX2 in osteoblasts. ChIP assays and promoter activity mapping revealed that RUNX1 directly associates with the Runx2 gene promoter and up-regulates Runx2 expression. Furthermore, the ChIP data also showed that RUNX1 associates with the Ocn promoter. In conclusion, RUNX1 up-regulates the expression of Runx2 and multiple bone-specific genes, and plays an indispensable role in bone formation and homeostasis in both trabecular and cortical bone. We propose that stimulating Runx1 activity may be useful in therapeutic approaches for managing some bone diseases such as osteoporosis."

However, it is difficult to determine which of the anthropometric indices of obesity is the best tool for diagnosing metabolic disorders. The aims of this study were to evaluate the usefulness of selected anthropometric indices and to determine optimal cut-off points for the identification of single metabolic disorders that are components of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Design Cross-sectional study. Participants We analyzed the data of 12,328 participants aged 55.7±5.4 years. All participants were of European descent. Primary outcome measure Four MetS components were included: high glucose concentration, high blood triglyceride concentration, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, and elevated blood pressure. The following obesity indices were considered: waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body fat percentage (%BF), Clínica Universidad de Navarra-body adiposity estimator (CUN-BAE), body roundness index (BRI), and a body shape index (ABSI). Results The following indices had the highest discriminatory power for the identification of at least one MetS component: CUN-BAE, BMI, and WC in men (AUC = 0.734, 0.728, and 0.728, respectively) and WHtR, CUN-BAE, and WC in women (AUC = 0.715, 0.714, and 0.712, respectively) (p<0.001 for all). The other indices were similarly useful, except for the ABSI. Conclusions For the BMI, the optimal cut-off point for the identification of metabolic abnormalities was 27.2 kg/m2 for both sexes. For the WC, the optimal cut-off point was of 94 cm for men and 87 cm for women. Prospective studies are needed to identify those indices in which changes in value predict the occurrence of metabolic disorders best."
https://openalex.org/W3036774153,"Globally, rising temperatures have resulted in numerous examples of poleward shifts in species distribution patterns with accompanying changes in community structure and ecosystem processes. In the Gulf of Mexico, higher mean temperatures and less frequent winter freezes have led to the expansion of tropics-associated marine organisms. Our objectives were to quantify changing environmental conditions and the poleward expansion of the common snook Centropomus undecimalis into the Cedar Keys area of Florida, USA (29 deg N). The snook is an economically and recreationally important sport fish found from southern Brazil to south Florida. Cedar Key and the Lower Suwannee River are north of the snook’s historically documented range, likely due to lethal water temperatures during winter. Using data from a long-term monitoring program, we report an increase in catches of snook in this area since 2007. The spatial and temporal expansion of the species began with adult fish in 2007. By 2018, snook of all sizes were found in the region, and we found strong evidence of local reproduction during 2016–2018. The locations of nursery habitat and winter thermal refuges (e.g., freshwater springs) need to be identified and have implications for land-use policy and minimum-flow regulations for rivers. The arrival of the snook in the northern Gulf of Mexico could affect food web ecology and habitat interactions among estuarine predators, and future studies should evaluate snook’s food habits and competitive interactions with resident fishes in this expanded range. Our study provides an example of how species range expansions due to changing temperatures should result in new research priorities to evaluate impacts of climate change on coastal systems."
https://openalex.org/W3036811681,"The sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract–binding protein 1) and HNRNP L (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L) protect mRNAs from nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) by preventing the UPF1 RNA helicase from associating with potential decay targets. Here, by analyzing in vitro helicase activity, dissociation of UPF1 from purified mRNPs, and transcriptome-wide UPF1 RNA binding, we present the mechanistic basis for inhibition of NMD by PTBP1. Unlike mechanisms of RNA stabilization that depend on direct competition for binding sites among protective RNA-binding proteins and decay factors, PTBP1 promotes displacement of UPF1 already bound to potential substrates. Our results show that PTBP1 directly exploits the tendency of UPF1 to release RNA upon ATP binding and hydrolysis. We further find that UPF1 sensitivity to PTBP1 is coordinated by a regulatory loop in domain 1B of UPF1. We propose that the UPF1 regulatory loop and protective proteins control kinetic proofreading of potential NMD substrates, presenting a new model for RNA helicase regulation and target selection in the NMD pathway."

They have been implicated in a variety of biochemical pathways but the physiologically relevant target of phosphatase activity has eluded 20 years of investigation. Here, we show that PRL3 catalytic activity is not required in a mouse model of metastasis. PRL3 binds and inhibits CNNM4, a membrane protein associated with magnesium transport. Analysis of PRL3 mutants specifically defective in either CNNM-binding or phosphatase activity demonstrate that CNNM binding is necessary and sufficient to promote tumor metastasis. As PRLs do have phosphatase activity, they are in fact pseudo-pseudophosphatases. Phosphatase activity leads to formation of phosphocysteine, which blocks CNNM binding and may play a regulatory role. We show levels of PRL cysteine phosphorylation vary in response to culture conditions and in different tissues. Examination of related protein phosphatases shows the stability of phosphocysteine is a unique and evolutionarily conserved property of PRLs.

Phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRLs) are small single-domain phosphatases within the family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP).

A very large number of studies have established the importance of the PRL catalytic site for cellular functions and oncogenicity; however, none distinguish between the phosphatase activity and CNNM binding. Cysteine-to-serine or alanine mutations disrupt PRL inhibition of CNNMs (4Funato Y. Yamazaki D. Mizukami S. Du L. Kikuchi K. Miki H. Membrane protein CNNM4-dependent Mg2+ efflux suppresses tumor progression.J. Clin.

Ekiel I. Structural insights into molecular function of the metastasis-associated phosphatase PRL-3.J. Biol.

Similarly, inhibitors that inhibit PRL cancer proliferation block both phosphatase activity and CNNM binding (33Zhang Z. Kozlov G. Chen Y.S. Gehring K. Mechanism of thienopyridone and iminothienopyridinedione inhibition of protein phosphatases.MedChemComm. 2019; 10 (31191869): 791-79910.1039/c9md00175aCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequentially, the relative importance of PRL phosphatase activity versus CNNM binding has remained unknown. To address this, we designed PRL mutations that are specifically defective in one function and tested their activity in Mg2+ efflux assays and an animal model of tumor metastasis. The results demonstrate that phosphatase activity is dispensable and highlight the importance of the PRL-CNNM signaling axis in cancer. Previous studies showed that substitution of the PRL3 catalytic cysteine by serine or alanine leads to loss of both phosphatase activity and CNNM binding (12Kozlov G. Cheng J. Ziomek E. Banville D. Gehring K. Ekiel I. Structural insights into molecular function of the metastasis-associated phosphatase PRL-3.J. Biol.

In protein phosphatases, the active site cysteine is present as a negatively charged thiolate so we reasoned that substitution of cysteine by aspartic acid might preserve CNNM-binding. To assess this, the PRL3 C104D mutant was prepared and its binding affinity measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 1). The substitution of the catalytic cysteine by aspartic acid retained full binding, whereas all other substitutions decreased binding affinity by 16-fold or more. The permissiveness of the binding site was very restricted: substitution by either asparagine, which is isosteric with aspartic acid, or glutamic acid, which is isoelectric, strongly decreased binding. To validate this remarkable result, we generated the same mutations in the other two PRL phosphatases. Both PRL2 C101D and PRL1 C104D showed near WT affinity in ITC experiments (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1). In contrast, mutations in the catalytic site (R101E) or the CNNM-binding site (R138E) blocked binding. We next tested the ability of the PRL mutants to bind to CNNM proteins in cells. COS7 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged PRL3 mutant constructs and FLAG-tagged CNNM4. Proteins were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation analysis to investigate their interaction in cells. In agreement with the ITC results, only WT PRL3 and the C104D mutant associated with CNNM4 (Fig. 1C). Having identified a mutant that retained CNNM-binding, we turned to assays of PRL3 phosphatase activity. We performed two types of assays to assess PRL3 enzymatic activity. In the first assay, we used a synthetic fluorogenic substrate, DiFMUP, to measure the rate of phosphate hydrolysis. The assays were conducted under single turnover conditions to detect the initial rate of catalysis (Fig. 2A). As expected, WT PRL3 showed good activity, whereas the C104D and other cysteine substitutions were completely inactive. In contrast, mutation of arginine 138, which is part of the CNNM-binding site but outside of the catalytic site, had little effect on phosphatase activity. The R138E mutant displayed nearly WT activity (Fig. 2C). As a second measure of phosphatase activity, we examined formation of the phosphocysteine intermediate upon incubation with a small molecule substrate, OMFP (22Zhang H. Kozlov G. Li X. Wu H. Gulerez I. Gehring K. PRL3 phosphatase active site is required for binding the putative magnesium transporter CNNM3.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 4810.1038/s41598-017-04855-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As expected, Phos-tag SDS-PAGE analysis showed formation of the phosphocysteine intermediate upon incubation with a small molecule substrate by WT PRL3 and the R138E mutant, whereas the cysteine mutants were inactive (Fig. 2B). Thus, we have identified two PRL3 mutations, C104D and R138E, which are selectively defective in either phosphatase activity or CNNM binding. The requirement for the PRL catalytic cysteine in CNNM binding is poorly understood. It does not make direct contacts with CNNM but its mutation has a large effect on binding. Crystal structures of PRL-CNNM complexes show only minor conformational changes despite large differences in affinity (13Gulerez I. Funato Y. Wu H. Yang M. Kozlov G. Miki H. Gehring K. Phosphocysteine in the PRL-CNNM pathway mediates magnesium homeostasis.EMBO Rep. 2016; 17 (27856537): 1890-190010.15252/embr.201643393Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Zhang H. Kozlov G.

Similarly, disulfide bond formation with an adjacent cysteine leads to a ∼500-fold loss of affinity with only modest structural changes (22Zhang H. Kozlov G. Li X. Wu H. Gulerez I. Gehring K.

To understand the molecular basis for CNNM binding by the C104D mutant, we carried out structural studies using X-ray crystallography. We were able to obtain crystals of the cysteine-to-aspartic acid mutants of PRL1 and PRL2 in complexes with the CBS-pair domain of CNNM3 and CNNM2 (Fig. 3A). The mutant complexes adopted the same arrangement as the WT complex with binding mediated by an extended loop from CNNM3 that inserts into the PRL catalytic site (Fig. 3B and Fig. S2). Surprisingly, the substitution of cysteine by aspartic acid shifted the binding site residues by less than 0.5 Å. Calculation of the partial charges in the PRL active site revealed the role of the catalytic cysteine in CNNM binding is primarily electrostatic (Fig. 3C). To act as a nucleophile, the pKa of the cysteine is shifted so it is deprotonated at neutral pH (10Guan K.L. Dixon J.E.

Measurements with Yersinia PTP show combined effects of the helix dipole and surrounding backbone amide groups shift the pKa by three pH units (34Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E.

We used the computational tool H++ to estimate the pKa of the PRL2 active site cysteine. H++ uses atomic coordinates to calculate protonation states based on the AMBER force field with an implicit continuum solvent model (36Anandakrishnan R. Aguilar B. Onufriev A.V. H++ 3.0: automating pK prediction and the preparation of biomolecular structures for atomistic molecular modeling and simulations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (22570416): W537-W54110.1093/nar/gks375Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The active site cysteine of PRL2 was calculated to have pKa of 4.5 to 5. Thus, the C104D mutation preserves high affinity binding of CNNM proteins because it conserves the negative charge of the cysteine thiolate (Fig. 3C). This paradoxical result is likely due to polarization of other PRL residues in the CNNM-binding site by the negative charge. The effects of mutations could also be readout as changes in the thermal stability of the PRL proteins. We used differential scanning fluorimetry (thermal shift assays), which measures binding of a hydrophobic dye to the denatured protein, to measure the melting temperatures of PRL1, PRL2, and PRL3 (Fig. 3D and Fig. S3). For all three, the cysteine-to-aspartic mutation increased the melting temperature by 8 °C or more, a large and highly significant change. The increase reflects the potential energy required to charge the cysteine. Strikingly, the PRL3 C104N mutation, which is the substitution of a single oxygen by nitrogen, led to a 22 °C decrease in stability relative to C104D. The importance of charge over steric fit was confirmed by the C104E mutation, which led to a small increase in stability of 2 °C. The R138E mutation that specifically inhibits CNNM binding had a negligible effect on protein stability. We next turned to assessing the function of the PRL mutants in HEK293 cells transfected with Myc-tagged constructs. As controls, we analyzed cell extracts by immunoblotting to measure expression levels and immunofluorescence microscopy to confirm the mutants were properly localized. All the proteins expressed well (Fig. 4A) but the C104N mutant had a defect in its localization. WT PRL3 and other mutants mainly localized at the plasma membrane but the C104N mutant formed aggregates in the cytosol (Fig. 4B). Accordingly, the C104N mutant was omitted from further analysis. PRL3 binding to CNNM proteins inhibits their Mg2+ efflux activity but it is not known if the effect requires phosphatase activity (4Funato Y. Yamazaki D. Mizukami S. Du L. Kikuchi K. Miki H.

To address this, we tested the PRL3 mutants in a Mg2+ efflux assay. HEK293 cells were transfected with CNNM4 and intracellular Mg2+ levels were monitored using the fluorescent indicator Magnesium Green (Fig. 4C). In the absence of PRL3, the Mg2+ level dropped when Mg2+ was removed from the extracellular milieu. Co-expression of WT PRL3 and the C104D mutant blocked the Mg2+ efflux. Conversely, co-expression of mutants that prevent CNNM binding had no effect on Mg2+ efflux. This demonstrates that the inhibition of CNNM activity by PRL3 is not due to dephosphorylation of CNNM4 or any other substrate. We next addressed the activities of the PRL3 mutants in a well-established experimental model of tumorigenesis. In this model, B16 mouse melanoma cells are injected into the tail vein of mice and the lung metastases were counted. Multiple groups have shown the importance of PRL3 in tumor implantation and outgrowth (4Funato Y. Yamazaki D. Mizukami S. Du L. Kikuchi K. Miki H.

In eukaryotes, initiation of cellular mRNA translation generally occurs via a cap-dependent pathway in which eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binds to the N7-methylguanosine-triphosphate (m7GpppN, where N is any nucleotide) cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA to be translated (3Hinnebusch A.G.

Cap-bound eIF4E subsequently recruits eIF4G, which, together with eIF4A, recruits a ribosomal 43S preinitiation complex (PIC) composed of the 40S ribosomal subunit, a methionylated initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet), and additional eIFs to the m7GpppN cap. Subsequent scanning of the resulting 48S PIC to find the AUG start codon on the mRNA and joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to the 48S PIC results in the formation of an elongation-competent 80S IC that can go on to translate the mRNA. In addition to undergoing cap-dependent initiation, many cellular mRNAs can also initiate translation via cap-independent pathways in response to changes in cellular conditions (5Komar A.A.

The subset of mRNAs that is translated cap independently under stress conditions as described above are predicted to contain highly stable structures in their 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) that may act as internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or cap-independent translation enhancers (CITEs) (5Komar A.A.

Regardless of whether their structured 5′ UTRs act as IRESs or CITEs, the ability of these mRNAs to bypass the 4E-BP-mediated global suppression of cap-dependent initiation has been linked to enhanced tumor development and cancer progression (2Braunstein S.

The overexpression of eIF4GI and DAP5 during stress conditions in which global cap-dependent translation initiation is suppressed implicates these two factors in cap-independent translation. DAP5 is a member of the eIF4G family that is homologous to the C-terminal two-thirds of eIF4GI (Fig. 1A) and that interacts with other known eIFs in manners that are both similar to and distinct from that of eIF4GI. Specifically, DAP5 and eIF4GI share 39% sequence identity in the central core region that comprises the eIF4A-, eIF3-, and RNA-binding domains (22Virgili G. Frank F. Feoktistova K. Sawicki M. Sonenberg N. Fraser C.S. Nagar B. Structural analysis of the DAP5 MIF4G domain and its interaction with eIF4A.Structure. 2013; 21 (23478064): 517-52710.1016/j.str.2013.01.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Consistent with its similarity to the domain structure of eIF4GI, DAP5 interacts with eIF4A and the eIF3 component of the 43S PIC (22Virgili G. Frank F. Feoktistova K. Sawicki M. Sonenberg N. Fraser C.S. Nagar B. Structural analysis of the DAP5 MIF4G domain and its interaction with eIF4A.Structure. 2013; 21 (23478064): 517-52710.1016/j.str.2013.01.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Notably, however, DAP5 lacks the N-terminal eIF4E- and polyadenine binding protein (PABP)-binding domains that are present in eIF4GI and, consequently, does not interact with eIF4E or PABP (Fig. 1A). In addition, the β subunit of eIF2 (eIF2β) that interacts with the ternary complex formed by eIF2, GTP, and Met-tRNAi (23Thakur A. Marler L. Hinnebusch A.G. A network of eIF2beta interactions with eIF1 and Met-tRNAi promotes accurate start codon selection by the translation preinitiation complex.Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47 (30576497): 2574-259310.1093/nar/gky1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) binds to the C-terminal domain of DAP5 but not to the corresponding domain in eIF4GI. Collectively, these differences between DAP5 and eIF4GI suggest differences in translation initiation mechanisms involving these two eIFs (14Lee S.H. McCormick F. p97/DAP5 is a ribosome-associated factor that facilitates protein synthesis and cell proliferation by modulating the synthesis of cell cycle proteins.EMBO J. 2006; 25 (16932749): 4008-401910.1038/sj.emboj.7601268Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For example, rather than interacting with eIF4E to recruit factors to the m7GpppN cap in cap-dependent initiation of mRNAs, DAP5 has instead been shown to mediate the cap-independent initiation of a subset of mRNAs, including those encoding Bcl2, Apaf-1, p53, and DAP5 itself (24Weingarten-Gabbay S. Khan D. Liberman N. Yoffe Y. Bialik S. Das S. Oren M. Kimchi A. The translation initiation factor DAP5 promotes IRES-driven translation of p53 mRNA.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (23318444): 611-61810.1038/onc.2012.626Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Liberman N.

With the exception of p53 mRNA, which contains a structural element that functions as an IRES and has been shown to bind DAP5 using electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies (24Weingarten-Gabbay S. Khan D. Liberman N. Yoffe Y. Bialik S. Das S. Oren M. Kimchi A.

To address these gaps in our understanding, we used a fluorescence anisotropy-based equilibrium binding assay to measure the affinities with which two variants of human eIF4GI, one that lacks the N-terminal, eIF4E-binding domain (eIF4GI682-1599) and one that contains the eIF4E binding domain (eIF4GI557-1599), as well as full-length human DAP5, bind to RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′ UTRs of a representative set of mRNAs. These mRNAs bypass (2Braunstein S. Karpisheva K. Pola C. Goldberg J. Hochman T. Yee H. Cangiarella J. Arju R. Formenti S.C. Schneider R.J.

These mRNAs were chosen because HIF-1α and FGF-9 have been shown to be translationally upregulated in hypoxic conditions where cap-dependent translation is suppressed and where eIF4GI and 4EBPI levels are overexpressed (2Braunstein S.

Khan D. Liberman N. Yoffe Y. Bialik S. Das S. Oren M. Kimchi A. The translation initiation factor DAP5 promotes IRES-driven translation of p53 mRNA.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (23318444): 611-61810.1038/onc.2012.626Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Complementing these binding assays, a luciferase-based gene expression reporter assay was used to characterize whether and to what extent binding of eIF4GI682-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, and/or DAP5 promotes the translation of luciferase-encoding mRNAs containing these same 5′ UTRs (UTR-Luc mRNAs) in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based cap-dependent in vitro translation system. We further used this assay with UTR-Luc mRNA constructs that either lack or have a highly stable, engineered hairpin (stem-loop) near the 5′ cap of the 5′ UTR that blocks initiation and scanning from the 5′ end. These experiments have further allowed us to investigate whether these mRNAs use an IRES-like or CITE-like mechanism of translation initiation. The results of our experiments demonstrate that eIF4GI682-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, and DAP5 exhibit differential binding affinities to the 5′ UTRs of the mRNAs encoding HIF-1α, FGF-9, and p53; that the eIF4E-binding domain of eIF4GI confers additional binding affinity and specificity; and that binding affinity positively correlates with the abilities of these eIFs to drive translation of these same UTR-Luc mRNAs. Moreover, the inhibition, or lack thereof, of translation initiation by the engineered hairpin suggests that some of these mRNAs use an IRES-like mechanism of translation initiation that does not require an exposed 5′ end, whereas others use a CITE-like mechanism (27Terenin I.M. Andreev D.E. Dmitriev S.E. Shatsky I.N. A novel mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation that is neither m7G-cap-, nor IRES-dependent.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 (23268449): 1807-181610.1093/nar/gks1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based on our observations, we propose that unlike cap-dependent translation, where binding of eIF4E to the m7G-cap is the initial event in protein synthesis, an important initial event in cap-independent initiation of eukaryotic cellular mRNAs with structured 5′ UTRs is the binding of eIF4GI or DAP5. These 5′ UTR structured mRNAs selectively recruit eIF4GI or DAP5 to drive expression of the proteins they encode, similar to the cap-independent initiation of CITE- or IRES-containing viral mRNAs (28Lee K.M.

To characterize the binding of eIF4GI and DAP5 to the 5′ UTRs of the mRNAs encoding HIF-1α, FGF-9, and p53, we used a fluorescence anisotropy-based equilibrium binding assay developed in our laboratories (Fig. 2A). This assay produces binding curves from fluorescence anisotropy changes that arise as titrated proteins bind to RNA oligonucleotides that are covalently 5′-end labeled with fluorescein and that lack a m7GpppN cap. Four RNA oligonucleotides comprising the 5′ UTRs of mRNAs encoding HIF-1α, FGF-9, and the two 5′ UTRs of p53 were assayed. The two p53 5′ UTRs represent the two 5′ UTRs involved in translation of the two distinct isoforms of p53. Each p53 5′ UTR contains elements that select for translation initiation at either an upstream start codon (p53A) or a downstream start codon (p53B), which produce the full-length p53 (FL-p53) or an N-terminal-truncated isoform (ΔN-p53), respectively (31Sharathchandra A. Katoch A. Das S. IRES mediated translational regulation of p53 isoforms.Wiley Interdiscip. Rev. RNA. 2014; 5 (24343861): 131-13910.1002/wrna.1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). When eIF4GI682-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, or DAP5 binds to one of the fluorescein-labeled 5′ UTRs, there is an increase in molecular weight of the 5′ UTR that increases the rotational restriction as the system becomes more rigid, resulting in a decrease in the rotational speed of the fluorescein-labeled 5′ UTR. The slower rotation is observed as increased fluorescence anisotropy of the fluorescein reporter. To quantify the affinity of eIF4GI557-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, and DAP5 binding to the four 5′ UTRs, we recorded the change in the fluorescence anisotropy of each fluorescein-labeled 5′ UTR as a function of increasing concentrations of eIF4GI682-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, and DAP5 and fitted the resulting data points with a single-site, equilibrium-binding isotherm (Fig. 2B, C, and D). The results of these experiments (Table 1) demonstrate that eIF4GI682-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, and DAP5 bind to the four 5′ UTRs with equilibrium dissociation constants (Kds) ranging from 12–290 nm (Table 1).Table 1Parameters describing the equilibrium binding of eIF4GI constructs and DAP5 to the 5′ UTRsaKd is the equilibrium dissociation constant, rmax–rmin is the amplitude (Amp.) that indicates change in anisotropy, and χ2 represents the goodness of fit.5′ UTReIF4GI557-1599eIF4GI682-1599DAP5Kd ± S.D.

Open table in a new tab Comparative analyses of our results demonstrate that eIF4GI682-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, and DAP5 exhibit differential binding affinities among the 5′ UTRs. Specifically, eIF4GI682-1599 binds to the p53A 5′ UTR with a Kd that is ∼2-fold higher (i.e. binding that is ∼2-fold weaker) than that with which it binds to the other 5′ UTRs (Table 1). DAP5 exhibited an even greater difference in binding affinity among the 5′ UTRs, with a Kd for the p53B 5′ UTR that is more than 2.5-fold lower than the Kd for the p53A 5′ UTR. It is important to note, however, that the trend of the differences in binding affinities between the two translation factors (eIF4GI682-1599 and DAP5) for the 5′ UTRs is similar. However, dramatic differences in binding among the 5′ UTRs were observed for eIF4GI557-1599. Inclusion of the eIF4E-binding domain in eIF4GI557-1599 relative to eIF4GI682-1599 increased the binding affinity of eIF4GI557-1599 from 1.8-fold (p53B 5′ UTR) to 10-fold (FGF-9 5′ UTR) compared with those measured for eIF4GI682-1599. Further, the differences in binding affinity among the 5′ UTRs were as much as 7-fold different compared with an ∼2-fold difference among the 5′ UTRs for eIF4GI682-1599. Taken together, these results suggest much of the specificity of eIF4GI binding to the 5′ UTRs is conferred by the eIF4E-binding domain (i.e. residues 557–682) of eIF4GI. To further investigate whether binding of eIF4GI and DAP5 to RNA depends on structural features within the RNA and to contextualize and validate the results of the binding studies described above, we assessed the binding of eIF4GI682-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, and DAP5 to a presumably unstructured, 101-nucleotide poly(UC) RNA oligonucleotide and an oligonucleotide encompassing the 5′ UTR of the mRNA encoding β-actin, which has been reported to utilize a cap-dependent mechanism for translation initiation (32Dmitriev S.E.

The results of these experiments demonstrate that eIF4GI682-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, and DAP5 do not exhibit appreciable binding to the polyUC oligonucleotide (Fig. 3A, B, and C and Table S1) or to the β-actin 5′ UTR, findings consistent with the hypothesis that structural features within the 5′ UTRs of our subset of RNAs act as specific recognition elements and binding sites for eIF4GI and DAP5. Previously, we have shown that eIF4F (a complex composed of eIF4GI, eIF4A, and eIF4E) binds to the 30-nucleotide iron-responsive element (IRE) stem-loop within the 5′ UTR of the mRNA encoding ferritin with a Kd of 9 nm, a binding interaction that stimulates ferritin mRNA translation in response to elevated cellular concentrations of iron (33Ma J.

Using the fluorescence anisotropy-based equilibrium binding assay, here we show that eIF4GI682-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, and DAP5 bind to the IRE with Kds of 18 nm, 15 nm, and 35 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 and Table S1). Similarly, we performed experiments in which we quantified the affinity of eIF4GI682-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, and DAP5 for the J/K domain of the IRES in the 5′ UTR of the positive-strand genomic RNA, encoding the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) polyprotein (Fig. 3 and Table S1). These experiments show that eIF4GI682-1599, eIF4GI557-1599, and DAP5 bind to the EMCV J/K IRES with Kds of 175 nm, 63 nm, and 519 nm, respectively. The Kd for binding of eIF4GI682-1599 to EMCV J/K IRES RNA is similar to what has been previously reported for the binding of human eIF4GI (643–1076) to the EMCV J/K IRES using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (170 nm [34Lomakin I.B.

https://openalex.org/W3036800146,"Abstract Local intravitreal or intra-arterial chemotherapy has improved therapeutic success for the pediatric cancer retinoblastoma (RB), but toxicity remains a major caveat. RB initiates primarily with RB1 loss or, rarely, MYCN amplification, but the critical downstream networks are incompletely understood. We set out to uncover perturbed molecular hubs, identify synergistic drug combinations to target these vulnerabilities, and expose and overcome drug resistance. We applied dynamic transcriptomic analysis to identify network hubs perturbed in RB versus normal fetal retina, and performed in vivo RNAi screens in RB1 null and RB1 wt ; MYCN amp orthotopic xenografts to pinpoint essential hubs. We employed in vitro and in vivo studies to validate hits, define mechanism, develop new therapeutic modalities, and understand drug resistance. We identified BRCA1 and RAD51 as essential for RB cell survival. Their oncogenic activity was independent of BRCA1 functions in centrosome, heterochromatin, or ROS regulation, and instead linked to DNA repair. RAD51 depletion or inhibition with the small molecule inhibitor, B02, killed RB cells in a Chk1/Chk2/p53-dependent manner. B02 further synergized with clinically relevant topotecan (TPT) to engage this pathway, activating p53–BAX mediated killing of RB but not human retinal progenitor cells. Paradoxically, a B02/TPT-resistant tumor exhibited more DNA damage than sensitive RB cells. Resistance reflected dominance of the p53–p21 axis, which mediated cell cycle arrest instead of death. Deleting p21 or applying the BCL2/BCL2L1 inhibitor Navitoclax re-engaged the p53–BAX axis, and synergized with B02, TPT or both to override resistance. These data expose new synergistic therapies to trigger p53-induced killing in diverse RB subtypes."

Despite these efforts, however, label availability and accuracy are both suboptimal. In this retrospective study, we aimed to automate the assignment of top-level International Classification of Diseases version 9 (ICD-9) codes to clinical records from human and veterinary data stores using minimal manual labor and feature curation. Automating top-level annotations could in turn enable rapid cohort identification, especially in a veterinary setting. To this end, we trained long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on 52,722 human and 89,591 veterinary records. We investigated the accuracy of both separate-domain and combined-domain models and probed model portability. We established relevant baseline classification performances by training Decision Trees (DT) and Random Forests (RF). We also investigated whether transforming the data using MetaMap Lite, a clinical natural language processing tool, affected classification performance. We showed that the LSTM-RNNs accurately classify veterinary and human text narratives into top-level categories with an average weighted macro F1 score of 0.74 and 0.68 respectively. In the “neoplasia” category, the model trained on veterinary data had a high validation accuracy in veterinary data and moderate accuracy in human data, with F1 scores of 0.91 and 0.70 respectively. Our LSTM method scored slightly higher than that of the DT and RF models. The use of LSTM-RNN models represents a scalable structure that could prove useful in cohort identification for comparative oncology studies.

https://openalex.org/W4239080657,"Background The National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) in India apply adult cutoffs of nutritional status for the estimation of undernutrition/overweight in the 15–19 age group. The prevalence of thinness in boys and girls thus estimated is 58.1% and 46.8% in NFHS-3, and 45% and 42% in NFHS-4 respectively. But the WHO recommends using age and sex-specific reference for adolescents. We reanalyzed the nutritional status of the adolescents using the WHO 2007 Growth Reference to obtain revised estimates of thinness, overweight and stunting across states, rural-urban residence, and wealth quintiles. Methods and findings Demographic information, anthropometric data, and wealth index were accessed from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) database. We re-analyzed the anthropometric data using WHO AnthroPlus software which uses the WHO 2007 Growth reference. The revised estimates of thinness assessed by BMI-for-age z-scores in boys and girls was 22.3% (95%CI: 21.6, 23.0) and 9.9% (95%CI: 9.5, 10.3) in NFHS-3 and 16.5% (95%CI: 16.0,17.0) and 9% (95%CI: 8.9, 9.2) in NFHS-4 respectively. Stunting was found to be 32.2% (95% CI: 31.6, 32.9) in boys and 34.4% (95% CI: 34.2, 34.7) in girls in NFHS-4. This was higher than that in NFHS-3; 25.2% (95% CI: 24.4, 26) in boys and 31.2 (95% CI: 30.6, 31.8) in girls. There was a clear socioeconomic gradient as there were higher thinness and stunting in rural areas. There was wide variation among the states with pockets of a double burden of malnutrition. Conclusion Using the adult cutoffs significantly overestimates thinness in adolescents in the age group of 15–19 years old in India. Stunting, which is an indicator of long term nutrition is also widely prevalent in them. Future editions of DHS and NFHS should consider adolescents as a separate age group for nutritional assessment for a better understanding of nutritional transition in the population."

Its theoretical importance and clinical significance are widely acknowledged. To assist and enhance future research, this study collected and evaluated concreteness/abstractness ratings for 9,877 two-character Chinese words retrieved from the MEga study of Lexical Decision in Simplified CHinese (MELD-SCH, Tsang et al, 2018). The ratings were validated through comparisons with previous rating studies on concreteness and imageability of smaller word samples. Relations of word concreteness with word frequency, age-of-acquisition, and efficiency of lexical processing were also examined. These ratings provide an additional dimension of information to two-character words in the database MELD-SCH, permitting not only more comprehensive research on the Chinese language, but also cross-language investigation of the concreteness effect between Chinese and other languages such as English and Dutch where a large database of concreteness ratings is also available."
https://openalex.org/W3036690767,"Prolonged maintenance of central venous catheters, including peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), is a major risk factor for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). This study was conducted to evaluate the appropriate duration of PICC maintenance to prevent CLABSI.A single-center retrospective study was conducted at an 824-bed tertiary hospital in Korea between January 2010 and December 2017. All hospitalized patients who underwent ultrasound-guided PICC insertion were enrolled. CLABSI was diagnosed according to the definitions of the National Health Safety Network. CLABSI caused by PICC was defined as PICC-associated bloodstream infection (PABSI). To identifying statistical correlations between catheter days and PABSI, the odds ratio for PABSI on the basis of the continuous value of catheter days was analyzed using restricted cubic spline splits with five knots. The optimal cut-off value for catheter days was identified by maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).A total of 1,053 patients underwent ultrasound-guided PICC insertion during the study period. Among them, 36 were confirmed as having a PABSI (3.5%, 36/1014; 1.14 per 1000 catheter days). In the restricted cubic spline regression, catheter days showed a dose-dependent relationship with the risk of PABSI. The AUC of the ROC curve for developing a PABSI according to the duration of catheter maintenance was 0.715 (95% CI, 0.639-0.790); the calculated optimal cut-off value was 25 days.The incidence of PABSI was 1.14 per 1000 catheter days and the optimal cut-off value of catheter days to avoid a PABSI was 25 days."
https://openalex.org/W3036831734,"Stakeholder involvement is pivotal EU governance. In this paper, we complete a stakeholder analysis of the European Chemicals Agency’s recent Annex XV restriction proposal process on intentionally added microplastics. The aim of this study is to map the interests, influence and importance of active stakeholders in order to understand the arguments being put forward by different stakeholders and provide recommendations to policy-makers on how to ensure a balanced consideration of all stakeholder perspectives. Stakeholders were identified through niche media analysis and by scrutinising comments from the public consultation on the restriction proposal. Their importance and influence were mapped using three approaches: “scale from low to high”, “psychometric scale” and “qualitative ranking”. We identified 205 different stakeholders out of which 77 were industry and trade associations, 25 were large companies and only four were small and medium-sized enterprises. National authorities and researchers did not comment on the restriction proposal, whilst large companies were very active providing comments. Industry trade associations and sports-related non-governmental organizations articulated anxiety about the costs associated with the implementation of the restriction proposal. Among environmental non-governmental organizations, there was consensus that plastics should be handled like other substances under EU’s chemical regulation. Primary stakeholders identified exhibited high importance, but varying degrees of influence, while the opposite applied to the major European institutions. Based on our analysis, we recommend that: The European Chemicals Agency implement measures to include “silent” stakeholders and invite guest experts to participate in their committees on Risk Assessment and Socio-Economic Analysis; Researchers should be more active in the public consultation; and that special emphasis should be put on helping small and medium-sized enterprises. With regards to stakeholder consultation, we find that media analysis is a good supplement to stakeholder analysis and that a more objective top-down measure of stakeholder importance and influence is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3036228158,"Here, we examine known GTPase regulators of vesicle trafficking events to assess whether they affect endothelial cell (EC) lumen and tube formation. We identify novel roles for the small GTPases Rab3A, Rab3B, Rab8A, Rab11A, Rab27A, RalA, RalB and caveolin-1 in co-regulating membrane trafficking events that control EC lumen and tube formation. siRNA suppression of individual GTPases such as Rab3A, Rab8A, and RalB markedly inhibit tubulogenesis, while greater blockade is observed with combinations of siRNAs such as Rab3A and Rab3B, Rab8A and Rab11A, and RalA and RalB. These combinations of siRNAs also disrupt very early events in lumen formation including the formation of intracellular vacuoles. In contrast, knockdown of the endocytosis regulator, Rab5A, fails to inhibit EC tube formation. Confocal microscopy and real-time videos reveal that caveolin-1 strongly labels intracellular vacuoles and localizes to the EC apical surface as they fuse to form the luminal membrane. In contrast, Cdc42 and Rab11A localize to a perinuclear, subapical region where intracellular vacuoles accumulate and fuse during lumen formation. Our new data demonstrates that EC tubulogenesis is coordinated by a series of small GTPases to control polarized membrane trafficking events to generate, deliver, and fuse caveolin-1-labeled vacuoles to create the apical membrane surface."

To investigate its contribution to copper resistance, here we undertook a structural and biochemical characterization of the CopG protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results from biochemical analyses of CopG purified under aerobic conditions indicate that it is a green copper-binding protein that displays absorbance maxima near 411, 581, and 721 nm and is monomeric in solution. Determination of the three-dimensional structure by X-ray crystallography revealed that CopG consists of a thioredoxin domain with a C-terminal extension that contributes to metal binding. We noted that adjacent to the CxCC motif is a cluster of four copper ions bridged by cysteine sulfur atoms. Structures of CopG in two oxidation states support the assignment of this protein as an oxidoreductase. On the basis of these structural and spectroscopic findings and also genetic evidence, we propose that CopG has a role in interconverting Cu(I) and Cu(II) to minimize toxic effects and facilitate export by the Cus RND transporter efflux system.

Copper ions are an essential cofactor for many enzymes and, thus, must be retained in the cell at sufficient levels to support metabolism. This cellular requirement is balanced by the potential for copper to show toxic effects when copper levels are too high. Bacteria can be exposed to various levels of copper through their environments; therefore, their ability to adapt to changing conditions is essential for their survival. When copper homeostasis systems are overwhelmed, growth inhibition or cell death occurs. This outcome forms the basis for the use of copper ions in a variety of clinical and environmental settings to control microbial growth (1Casey A.L. Adams D. Karpanen T.J. Lambert P.A. Cookson B.D.

Copper ions have shown promise in combating infections, including those from multidrug resistance organisms; however, bacterial resistance systems counter human efforts to use metal ions as broad-spectrum biocides. Therefore, a thorough understanding of how bacteria sense and respond to metal ions is needed to maintain this avenue to fight infection in this era of rapidly increasing multidrug resistance. The exact mechanisms of copper toxicity are still under debate (reviewed in reference 4Vincent M. Duval R.E. Hartemann P. Engels-Deutsch M. Contact killing and antimicrobial properties of copper.J. Appl. Microbiol. 2018; 124 (29280540): 1032-104610.1111/jam.13681Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) but appear to involve two main mechanisms. Metalloenzymes can be inactivated by metal ion displacement with Cu(I), particularly those containing Fe-S clusters (5Macomber L. Imlay J.A. The iron-sulfur clusters of dehydratases are primary intracellular targets of copper toxicity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2009; 106 (19416816): 8344-834910.1073/pnas.0812808106Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Free copper ions can generate damaging hydroxyl radicals and reactive oxygen species through Fenton-like chemistry (6Espírito Santo C. Lam E.W. Elowsky C.G. Quaranta D. Domaille D.W. Chang C.J. Grass G. Bacterial killing by dry metallic copper surfaces.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 77 (21148701): 794-80210.1128/AEM.01599-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 7Halliwell B.

Cu(I) is also thought to be capable of passing through the cell membrane, whereas Cu(II) cannot. Therefore, decreasing the intracellular pool of free copper ions protects cells from toxicity. Bacteria maintain metal ion homeostasis through a coordinated network of systems to detect, import, detoxify, traffic, sequester, and export metal ions. In response to elevated metal ion concentrations, transcription factors or two-component systems detect metal ions and then upregulate appropriate genes. Primary or secondary transporters are commonly used to export metal ions, and these systems may also include metallochaperones that maintain the metal ion in a sequestered state before removal from the cell. Under aerobic conditions, enzymatic detoxification of copper ions by oxidation to Cu(II) via a multicopper oxidase also provides protection. Well-characterized systems that provide these responses to elevated levels of copper ions include the transcription factor and two-component systems, CueR and CusRS, respectively, of Escherichia coli; P-type ATPases, such as E. coli CopA; tripartite efflux systems (RND transporters), such as CusCBA; CopZ chaperones (8Novoa-Aponte L. Ramirez D. Arguello J.M. The interplay of the metallosensor CueR with two distinct CopZ chaperones defines copper homeostasis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Biol.

Rensing C. CueO is a multi-copper oxidase that confers copper tolerance in Escherichia coli.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Metal ion homeostasis systems are commonly organized into operons and/or clustered within metal resistance islands. These regions also include additional genes encoding proteins of unknown function. Among these uncharacterized ORFs is a small gene, copG, also annotated as encoding the Pfam domain DUF411. The copG gene encodes a protein of ∼14 kDa with limited homology to previously characterized proteins. To investigate the role for the CopG protein in metal homeostasis, we carried out structural and biochemical characterization of the CopG protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in conjunction with genetic studies of its role in copper resistance. We show that CopG possesses a tetranuclear copper cluster in a modified thioredoxin domain. The structural details suggest that the protein contributes to copper resistance by harnessing the redox properties of this fold to reduce copper, adding to our knowledge of the adaptive strategies bacteria utilize in response to elevated metal ions. A homology search using the Pseudomonas aeruginosa CopG sequence reveals over 8000 distinct proteins containing putative CopG domains from diverse Gram-negative bacterial species. The presence of localization sequences indicates that these are periplasmic proteins. Comparison of the genomic context of genes encoding CopG homologs shows that CopG is frequently associated with known metalloproteins. Genes encoding CopG are also found in metal resistance islands and other mobile genetic elements associated with metal resistance (11Hao X. Lüthje F.L. Qin Y. McDevitt S.F. Lutay N. Hobman J.L.

These include CueO-like multicopper oxidases, CopA-like P-type copper translocases, and CusCBA-like RND efflux systems. (Note that in P. aeruginosa, however, the copG gene is not in the immediate vicinity of any of these.) Sequence comparison of CopG homologs revealed a subset of highly conserved residues that includes potential metal ligands. Fig. 2 shows the CopG sequences from the organisms shown in Fig. 1 extracted from an alignment of 1000 homologs of P. aeruginosa CopG. Among the absolutely conserved residues are four cysteines, three of which are found in an unusual CxCC motif (residues 13–16). Additional conserved residues include His 55, His 67, Cys 54, Met 90, and Met 97. The role of copG in conferring copper resistance was tested by comparison of the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PAO1/ΔcopG strains in the presence of differing amounts of copper. Plate assays show that the ΔcopG strain grows less well in the presence of increasing copper concentrations under anaerobic conditions but has growth similar to that of PAO1 under aerobic conditions (Fig. 3). To investigate the mechanism by which CopG contributes to copper resistance, we cloned, expressed, and purified the protein and subjected it to biochemical characterization. Purified CopG is dark green in color to the naked eye, displays absorbance maxima near 411 nm, 581 nm, and 721 nm (Fig. 4), and is monomeric in solution (Fig. S1). When purified from cells grown in the absence of supplemental copper, CopG has a CD spectrum indicating that the protein is predominantly unfolded, but when cells are grown in the presence of 1 mm copper sulfate, a spectrum of the resulting protein shows features consistent with a folded configuration (Fig. S2). Analysis of the secondary structure content predicts a mixed alpha/beta structure for the copper-bound state. As determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy, CopG contains 3.4 ± 1.0 molar equivalents of copper when purified from cells grown in media containing 1 mm copper sulfate. Metal could be removed from CopG by dialysis in the presence of the copper chelator phenanthroline, yielding samples with <0.1 molar equivalents. The CD spectrum of CopG depleted of metals shows that the majority of secondary structure features are lost (Fig. S3). Attempts to restore metal to the protein treated with chelators caused the protein to precipitate. To gain insight into CopG function and copper binding mode, we carried out structural characterization of CopG by X-ray crystallography. In the crystallization trials, two crystal forms of CopG with space groups P61 (form I) and P212121 (form II) were obtained. Form I crystals appear green in color, whereas form II crystals appear clear. The structure of CopG was determined by SAD using data from selenomethionine-substituted protein in crystal form I, and the resulting model was used to solve form II via molecular replacement. The crystal forms contain two and six independent copies of CopG in the asymmetric unit, respectively. The structure of CopG consists of a single domain with a central 7-stranded mixed β-sheet with segments A–D connecting individual strands 1–2 (segment A), 2–3 (B), 4–5 (C), and 5–6 (D) (Fig. 5A). The connections between strands 3–4 and 6–7 are short beta-turns. The N-terminal 77 residues comprising the first 4 strands along with the three helix-containing segments form a thioredoxin-like fold, and the remaining 49 residues comprise a C-terminal extension that consists of the three remaining strands and segment D. Segment A contains a helical region (helix A) from residues 14–26, at the N terminus of which is located the conserved CxCC motif (residues 13–16). Segments B and C each contain helical regions (residues 38–45, helix B; residues 70–79, helix C) and connections to the β-strands. Segment B also contains a short region consistent with a single helical turn. Several potential copper-binding residues are highly conserved between CopG sequences, including the CxCC motif of residues 13–16, Cys 54, His 55, His 67, Met 90, and Met 97. In the CopG structure, these conserved residues are located at the junction of helix A, the end of strands 3 and 4, and in segment D. The CxCC motif of residues 13–16 is seen to be a variant of the CxxC motif common in the active site of thioredoxin domains and is located at the N terminus of helix A. The strongest features in the electron density map are four peaks corresponding to a tetranuclear metal cluster, with the conserved CxCC motif of residues 13–16, Cys 54, His 55, His 67, Met 90, and Met 97 serving as direct ligands. An anomalous difference map showed these peaks arise from copper ions (Fig. 5B) (13Sommerhalter M. Lieberman R.L. Rosenzweig A.C.

In the metal cluster, three copper ions (Cu1, Cu2, and Cu3) are arranged in a triangle ligated by three equatorial cysteine sulfur atoms (Fig. 6). Below the plane of the triangle are three nitrogen ligands from two histidine side chain residues and a backbone amide nitrogen. Thus, each of these three copper ions has 2 adjacent sulfur ligands and a nitrogen ligand. A fourth cysteine sulfur is located above the plane formed by the triangle, serving as a ligand only to the copper ion (Cu3) that has the backbone amide ligand. The primary ligands to copper ions 1–3 are from the thioredoxin domain, whereas the two Met ligands to Cu4, located on the protein's surface, are from segment D in the C-terminal extension. Cu1 and Cu2 have trigonal planar geometry, whereas Cu3 is square planar.

Open table in a new tab The Cu4 ion is in a distinct environment and lies on the surface of the protein at the base of a shallow depression. The surrounding surface is hydrophobic in the immediate vicinity of the copper ion. The Cu4 ion is tetrahedral, with two sulfur ligands coming from methionine side chains within segment D, a third ligand supplied by a cysteine (Cys 15), and, in all eight molecules in both crystal forms, a fourth ligand to Cu4 supplied by a nonconserved methionine sulfur atom (Met 99) from a symmetry-related molecule. In addition to residues serving as direct ligands to metals, conserved sites include three glycines and two proline residues within the irregular loop region of segment D. These likely provide important structural constraints to position the Met 90 and 97 side chains for interaction with Cu4. The backbone carbonyl of Pro 95 interacts with Nϵ of His 67, which positions the His 67 Nδ for interactions with Cu2. Trp 19, which is also highly conserved, appears to form a hydrogen–π interaction with His 55, where the indole π ring interacts with the protonated Nϵ of His 55, orienting the deprotonated Nδ for interaction with Cu1. Another set of conserved residues form a buried salt bridge (Glu 65, Lys 42) that also involves Thr 56. On the opposite side of the molecule from the exposed copper is an internal pocket (Fig. 7A), the walls of which are hydrophobic and formed mainly by Leu 23 and the absolutely conserved Trp 19. Comparison of the structures of CopG from the two crystal forms shows some conformational rearrangements as well as differences near the metal cluster (Fig. 7). These structural changes are associated with the formation of a disulfide cross-link between the side chains of Cys 13 and 16 in crystal form II (Fig. 7B). Cys 13 is located in the loop between strand 1 and the N terminus of helix A, and formation of the disulfide with Cys 16 alters the loop conformation. This change propagates to the adjacent helix B, which undergoes a 1.5-Å axial shift relative to its position in the form I structure. In addition, disulfide formation sequesters two of the Cu3 ligands and pulls the Cys 13 side chain closer to Cys 16 such that it lies about 1.5 Å from the Cu3 site. These changes displace the copper ion at the Cu3 site in 4 of the 6 chains in form II (Fig. S8). In the remaining two chains, some weak density at the Cu3 site is present, suggesting these locations in the crystal have a mixed population comprised of a superposition of a reduced state in which Cu3 is present and an oxidized state where Cu3 is not present and a disulfide bond has formed between the side chains of Cys 13 and 16. Comparing all 8 chains, the regions of the molecule with the largest structural variability are segment B, the loop between strand 1 and helix A, and the turn between strands 6 and 7. These regions lie on one face of the structure, on the opposite side from the pocket adjacent to W19. As the chains from form I lie within the set of conformations spanned by the chains from form II, the variability seen at these sides appears to be independent of disulfide formation. Both crystal forms contain a similar arrangement in which the Met 99 side chain from one chain is reciprocally shared as the ligand to Cu4, such that the asymmetric unit in crystal forms I and II are comprised of one and three such pairs, respectively. Superposition of one chain from each pair indicates that the relative orientation of each pair of chains differs significantly from the others (Fig. S7). Analysis by PDBePISA (14Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol.

This is consistent with the size-exclusion chromatography data, which indicated the protein is monomeric. In chains A and B from form I and chains A, B, E, and F from form II, the Met99 sulfur atom serves as a ligand to Cu4. In chains C and D from form II, which are the two showing partial occupancy at the Cu3 site, additional density adjacent to the Met99 side chain is present (Fig. S10). In these chains, the side chain is modeled as S-dioxymethionine and is positioned such that the two oxygens on these side chains interact with Cu4 and Cu3. Both crystal forms also contain a number of bound zinc ions, which are present in the crystallization buffer. These could be distinguished from copper through the use of anomalous difference maps (13Sommerhalter M. Lieberman R.L. Rosenzweig A.C.

The amino acids serving as ligands at these sites are not conserved (Fig. S6), suggesting that zinc binding is an artifact of the crystallization conditions. CopG-like proteins are currently classified as uncharacterized conserved proteins and are variously annotated as members of COG3019 (15Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J.

Several prior lines of evidence have previously implicated CopG as being involved in copper metabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Transcript levels for the copG gene were found to be elevated after copper exposure (21Teitzel G.M. Geddie A. De Long S.K. Kirisits M.J. Whiteley M. Parsek M.R. Survival and growth in the presence of elevated copper: transcriptional profiling of copper-stressed Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J.

In a recent study of protein levels associated with copper exposure in P. aeruginosa PA01, the CopG protein showed the second highest fold increase in abundance (16.2-fold) of the observed proteins following copper treatment (23Wright B.W. Kamath K.S. Krisp C. Molloy M.P.

In Vibrio cholerae, copG also was shown to contribute to copper resistance under anaerobic conditions (24Marrero K. Sanchez A. Gonzalez L.J. Ledon T. Rodriguez-Ulloa A. Castellanos-Serra L. Perez C. Fando R.

Here, we have provided direct experimental data showing that CopG from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a copper-binding protein and, in this organism, contributes to copper resistance under anaerobic conditions. The broader mechanism by which CopG does so remains to be delineated, but the structure offers some insights into the likely biochemical function of this protein. CopG contains a copper site with a unique arrangement, providing the first observation of a new type of copper center (Fig. 6A). In crystal form I, copper ions 1–3 form a triangle with three bridging cysteine sulfur atoms arranged equatorially, with each copper sharing 2 sulfur ligands. Ligands below the plane of the triangle in CopG are all nitrogens, two from histidines and a third, on Cu3, from a backbone amide. Cu3 also has another unshared ligand from Cys 13 above the plane of the triangle. This arrangement suggests a 3-metal generalization of the diamond-core 2-metal CuA site found in cytochrome c oxidase (25Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H.

This study aimed to identify lifestyle latent classes related to distinct domains of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) among adolescents and their association with health outcomes. This cross-sectional study included 217 Brazilian adolescents (15 to 18 years old, 49.3% female). The classes were based on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light physical activity (LPA), number of steps, sedentary behavior (SB), and screen time (ST). To assess these behaviors, participants wore an accelerometer for one week. ST, demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and signs of common mental disorders (CMD) were evaluated through questionnaires. Latent Class Analysis was used to identify lifestyle classes. Three classes were recognized: “Active—Non-sedentary” (class 1) with 28.1% of adolescents; “Inactive—Non-sedentary” (class 2), 48.85%; and “Inactive—Sedentary” (class 3), 23.04%. Sex and signs of CMD were associated with the prevalence of the classes. Female adolescents presented 4.48 (95% CI 2.04–9.77) times more chance of belonging to the “Inactive—Sedentary” (class 3). Adolescents who presented CMD had 11.35 (95% CI 3.45–101.1) times more chance of belonging to the “Inactive—Non-sedentary” (class 2). The interaction between sex and signs of CMD showed that girls with signs of CMD were 9.20 (95% CI 1.17–71.52) more likely to belong to the Inactive—Sedentary class than the “Active—Non-sedentary”. Results indicate that sex and signs of CMD can affect the prevalence of the classes. Our findings highlight that physical inactivity and SB can be associated with signs of CMD, especially in female adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3036665885,"Study question While physician relationships (measured through shared patients) are associated with clinical and utilization outcomes, the extent to which this is driven by local or global network characteristics is not well established. The objective of this research is to examine the association between local and global network statistics with total medical spending and utilization. Data source Data used are the 2011 Massachusetts All Payer Claims Database. Study design The association between network statistics and total medical spending and utilization (using standardized prices) is estimated using multivariate regression analysis controlling for patient demographics and health status. Data collection We limit the sample to continuously enrolled commercially insured patients in Massachusetts in 2011. Principal findings Mean patient age was 45 years, and 56.3% of patients were female. 73.4% were covered by a health maintenance organization. Average number of visits was 5.43, with average total medical spending of $4,911 and total medical utilization of $4,252. Spending was lower for patients treated by physicians with higher degree (p<0.001), eigenvector centrality (p<0.001), clustering coefficient (p<0.001), and measures reflecting the normalized degree (p<0.001) and eigenvector centrality (p<0.001) of specialists connected to a patient’s PCP. Spending was higher for patients treated by physicians with higher normalized degree, which accounts for physician specialty and patient panel size (p<0.001). Results were similar for utilization outcomes, although magnitudes differed indicating patients may see different priced physicians. Conclusions Generally, higher values of network statistics reflecting local connectivity adjusted for physician characteristics are associated with increased costs and utilization, while higher values of network statistics reflecting global connectivity are associated with decreased costs and utilization. As changes in the financing and delivery system advance through policy changes and healthcare consolidation, future research should examine mechanisms through which this structure impacts outcomes and potential policy responses to determine ways to reduce costs while maintaining quality and coordination of care. What this study adds It is unknown whether local and global measures of physician network connectivity associated with spending and utilization for commercially insured patients? In this social network analysis, we found generally higher values of network statistics reflecting local connectivity are associated with increased costs and utilization, while higher values of network statistics reflecting global connectivity are associated with decreased costs and utilization. Understanding how to influence local and global physician network characteristics may be important for reducing costs while maintaining quality."

The de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, ubiquitous across the tree of life, includes a series of reactions catalyzing the conversion of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate into inosine monophosphate, a key intermediate in nucleotide metabolism.

In the majority of eukaryotic organisms these steps are catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme PAICS (phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase and phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide synthetase) harboring AIR carboxylase (AIRc) and SAICAR synthetase (SAICARs) activities in a single polypeptide chain (Fig. 1), whereas prokaryotes, yeast, and plants have separate enzymes to catalyze these two reactions (16Firestine S.M.

Although most eukaryotes and some bacteria perform the AIRc reaction in a single step using a PurE-II–type AIRc activity, in bacteria, yeast, and plants, CAIR is synthesized in two steps: AIR is carboxylated at N5 in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by PurK and the resulting N5-CAIR is then converted to CAIR by the mutase PurE-I, a homologue of PurE-II (18Meyer E.

In light of PAICS being a promising novel therapeutic target for cancer treatment, information on binding of its natural ligands is of importance for the development of potent and selective PAICS inhibitors. We therefore set out to produce enzymatically active PAICS and to solve the structures of PAICS in complex with its natural ligands. We present here the first structures of PAICS in complex with CAIR bound in active sites of both domains and with SAICAR bound in the SAICAR synthetase domain. In addition, we report the PAICS structure with SAICAR and an ATP analog, AMP-PNP (adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate), occupying the SAICAR synthetase active site. Furthermore, we confirm that PAICS depletion has a negative effect on the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells supporting the validity of PAICS as an anti-cancer target. The structural data presented here provide for the first time insight into substrate and/or product binding and the architecture of the two active sites of PAICS, thus providing important structural information for future rational design of PAICS inhibitors. To demonstrate the importance of PAICS for the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells, we have generated inducible PAICS knockdown in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU-145. The depletion of PAICS protein resulted in a significantly reduced ability to proliferate and form colonies in both cell lines, whereas no effect was seen in the control shNT cells (Fig. 2). These results confirm an important role of PAICS in androgen-receptor negative prostate cancer cell growth (7Chakravarthi B.V. Goswami M.T. Pathi S.S. Dodson M. Chandrashekar D.S. Agarwal S. Nepal S.

The PAICS protein was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli in fusion with His6-tagged CPD tag and was successfully purified in high yield to over 95% purity and homogeneity (Fig. S1) by a combination of affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. The activity of the purified protein was tested at different concentrations using the PAICS-catalyzed reaction converting CAIR to SAICAR, requiring l-aspartate and energy in the form of ATP, which is converted to ADP and Pi. The formed ADP was detected using an ADP-Glo Kinase Assay (Fig. S1). The amount of ADP produced clearly increased with increased concentrations of PAICS and the use of 3 nm PAICS in the activity assay shows that the enzyme is highly active and provides a robust and reproducible activity assay with a signal to background ratio of ∼20 and a Z-factor above 0.7. To elucidate the binding of substrates and products to PAICS, we have solved two crystal structures of PAICS in complexes with natural ligands. The data collection and refinement parameters are shown in Table 1. Because the PAICS crystals were very small thin needles, the data were collected using a microfocused high-intensity X-ray beam and the diffraction pattern exhibited anisotropy. This resulted in slightly higher Rmeas values. In one structure, determined at a resolution of 2.4 Å, both AIRc active sites of both PAICS monomers in the asymmetric unit are occupied by CAIR (the product), whereas the SAICARs active site is occupied by CAIR (the substrate) in one of the monomers and by SAICAR (the product) in the second monomer. It also contains 9 molecules of ethylene glycol and 2 imidazole molecules originating from the crystallization mother liquor. The other structure, also determined at a resolution of 2.4 Å, has empty AIRc active sites, whereas the SAICARs active sites are occupied by both SAICAR-Mg2+ (the product) and AMP-PNP-Mg2+ (an ATP substrate analog). It also contains 6 molecules of ethylene glycol. In both structures, the first six N-terminal residues could not be modeled and seem to be disordered based on the low quality of the electron density map at the N terminus. The two structures are very similar and superpose with an RMSD of 0.330 Å for the superposition of all protein atoms. Both structures have two almost identical protein chains in the asymmetric unit (RMSD of 0.242 Å and 0.182 Å for the first and second PAICS structure, respectively, for the superposition of all protein atoms). Using crystallographic symmetry operations, the biologically active PAICS octamer with a pseudo 422 symmetry (D4) was generated (Fig. 3). The PAICS octamer is composed of a tightly packed core of eight C-terminal AIRc domains surrounded by eight N-terminal SAICARs domains.Table 1Crystal parameters, data collection, and refinement statisticsLigandCAIR, SAICARSAICAR, AMP-PNP, Mg2+PDB code6yb86yb9Data collection statistics Space groupI222I222 Cell parameters (Å; °)a = 60.9, b = 153.9, c = 223.6; α = β = γ = 90a = 61.3, b = 154.0, c = 223.6; α = β = γ = 90 Number of molecules in AU22 Wavelength (Å)10.9686 Resolution (Å)47.15-2.36 (2.51-2.36)47.33-2.41 (2.55-2.41) Number of unique reflections43,523 (6,857)41,224 (6,531) Multiplicity13.8 (14.3)10.9 (10.9) Completeness (%)99.8 (99.2)99.0 (98.7) Rmeas (%)aRmeas defined in Ref. 31.26.6 (119.5)35.3 (110.0) CC(1/2) (%)bPearson's correlation coefficient determined on the data set randomly split in half.99.5 (77.5)96.6 (72.4) Average I/σ(I)8.39 (1.81)5.16 (1.82) Wilson B (Å2)37.439.7Refinement statistics Resolution range (Å)47.15-2.36 (2.42-2.36)47.33-2.41 (2.47-2.41) No. of reflections in working set41,346 (2,941)39,161 (2,788) No. of reflections in test set2,177 (156)2,061 (146) R value (%)cR value = ||Fo| − |Fc||/|Fo|, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively.17.7 (32.9)17.7 (27.9) Rfree value (%)dRfree is equivalent to the R-value but is calculated for 5% of the reflections chosen at random and omitted from the refinement process (32).23.5 (36.6)22.9 (33.6) RMSD bond length (Å)0.0120.012 RMSD angle (°)1.6401.585 Number of atoms in AU7,1266,964 Number of protein atoms in AU6,5286,528 Mean B value (Å2)39.139.2Ramachandran plot statisticseDetermined by MolProbity (33).

Open table in a new tab PAICS was crystallized with its final product, SAICAR, however, the SAICAR molecule appears to be unstable, as demonstrated for other intermediates in the purine de novo biosynthesis pathway like AIR and CAIR (34Groziak M.P.

SAICAR is likely to have decomposed spontaneously back to CAIR because the density in the AIRc active site corresponds to the CAIR molecule with an occupancy of 0.75. Due to the lower occupancy of the ligand and a relatively low quality of the electron density map for the ligand, we confirmed the presence of CAIR in the active site by calculating Polder omit maps for the CAIR molecule after simulated annealing refinement performed while omitting the CAIR molecules from the model (Fig. 4). The CAIR molecule, which is the product of the AIRc active site, interacts with the protein through a network of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 4). The carboxylate group of CAIR stacks with residue His-303 and residues Val-328, Ala-329, Arg-331, Asn-333, and Leu-335 are within van der Waals distance from CAIR. The phosphate moiety also interacts with residues from the neighboring PAICS monomer and forms two hydrogen bonds with residue Ser-370 and is also within van der Waals distance from residue Pro-369, which demonstrates why the octameric assembly is important for the catalytic activity of PAICS. The previously published 2.8 Å structure of human PAICS was suggested to contain a molecule of CO2 in a proposed CO2-binding site, located at the 2-fold crystallographic axis about 8 Å away from the C4 of AIR (29Li S.X. Tong Y.P. Xie X.C. Wang Q.H. Zhou H.N. Han Y. Zhang Z.Y. Gao W. Li S.G. Zhang X.C. Bi R.C. Octameric structure of the human bifunctional enzyme PAICS in purine biosynthesis.J. Mol.

The electron density for none of our PAICS structures suggests the presence of a CO2 molecule at this site and we propose that the actual CO2-binding site of PAICS is the one occupied in this structure by the carboxylate group of CAIR. A similar site is occupied by a CO2 molecule in the structure of the homologous enzyme PurE from Acetobacter aceti H59N inactive mutant in complex with AIR and CO2 (PDB code 5clj), suggesting that in case of human PAICS, the CO2 molecule would form main polar contacts with the main chain nitrogen atoms of residues Ala-302, Gly-334, and Leu-335. The SAICARs active site of the first PAICS monomer in the asymmetric unit contains a CAIR molecule, a substrate of this active site. The PAICS–CAIR interaction network of direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds is shown in Fig. 5A. Residues Glu-97, Val-99, Thr-105, Gly-106, Met-190, Lys-191, and Ser-213 are also within van der Waals distance from the CAIR molecule. The SAICARs active site of the second PAICS monomer in the asymmetric unit contains a SAICAR molecule, which is a product of this active site (Fig. 5A). The CAIR portion of the SAICAR product forms essentially the same interaction network with the active site residues as in the case of the CAIR substrate and the N-succinyl moiety of SAICAR forms a number of additional hydrogen bond interactions (Fig. 5A), and residues Lys-17, Thr-40, Ala-41, and Asp-137 are also within the distance for van der Waals interactions. The SAICARs active sites in both PAICS monomers also contain a molecule of imidazole from the crystallization mother liquor. The imidazole molecule stacks with the imidazole ring of CAIR/SAICAR and with residue Phe-129 and forms hydrogen bonds to the phosphate of CAIR/SAICAR and to residue Glu-97. The serendipitous presence of imidazole bound in the active site might assist future design of inhibitors. The ATP-binding sites in both monomers have an ethylene glycol molecule from the crystallization mother liquor bound in the adenosine ring-binding cavity. The AIRc active site is not occupied by any ligand and the long binding cleft of the SAICARs active site is occupied by the product, SAICAR and AMP-PNP, which is an analog to the co-substrate ATP. Because AMP-PNP is stabilized by magnesium cations, we crystallized the enzyme in the presence of MgCl2 and the structure revealed one Mg2+ cation bound to each SAICAR and AMP-PNP molecule. These two magnesium cations together with two water molecules bridge the two ligands in the active site (Fig. 6A). Although the crystals from which the two different structures were solved were grown in very similar crystallization mother liquor, no imidazole molecules were bound in this structure. SAICAR-Mg2+ binds to the SAICARs active site with a similar interaction network as in the structure without the magnesium and AMP-PNP (Fig. 5B). The direct hydrogen-bonding pattern for the CAIR moiety is almost the same, but the ribose does not form any water-mediated interactions. Also, the imidazole ring is slightly rotated here to bind the magnesium cation, and interacts therefore directly with residue Glu-97. The phosphate moiety does not form water-mediated interactions with Lys-110, but interacts with a water molecule, which forms a π-stacking interaction with Phe-129. The amide carbonyl group of SAICAR is rotated toward the magnesium cation and interacts with a water molecule that"

A promising strategy is to transplant high numbers of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Therefore, an improved ex vivo culture system that supports proliferation and maintains HSC pluripotency would override possible limitations in cell numbers gained from donors. To model the natural HSC niche in vitro, we optimized the HSC medium composition with a panel of cytokines and valproic acid and used an artificial 3D bone marrow-like scaffold made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). This 3D scaffold offered a suitable platform to amplify human HSCs in vitro and, simultaneously, to support their viability, multipotency and ability for self-renewal. Silicon oxide-covering of PDMS structures further improved amplification of CD34+ cells, although the conservation of naïve HSCs was better on non-covered 3D PDMS. Finally, we found that HSC cultivated on non-covered 3D PDMS generated most pluripotent colonies within colony forming unit assays. In conclusion, by combining biological and biotechnological approaches, we optimized in vitro HSCs culture conditions, resulting in improved amplification, multipotency maintenance and vitality of HSCs."

More knowledge is needed about the quality of end-of-life care in order to understand the burden of the illness and the ability of the current health care system to deliver timely and appropriate end-of-life care. The aim of this study was to describe the impact of initial treatment strategy and survival time on the quality of end-of-life care among patients with oesophageal and gastric cancer.This register-based cohort study included patients who died from oesophageal and gastric cancer in Sweden during 2014-2016. Through linking data from the National Register for Esophageal and Gastric Cancer, the National Cause of Death Register, and the Swedish Register of Palliative Care, 2156 individuals were included. Associations between initial treatment strategy and survival time and end-of-life care quality indicators were investigated. Adjusted risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using modified Poisson regression.Patients with a survival of ≤3 months and 4-7 months had higher RRs for hospital death compared to patients with a survival ≥17 months. Patients with a survival of ≤3 months also had a lower RR for end-of-life information and bereavement support compared to patients with a survival ≥17 months, while the risks of pain assessment and oral assessment were not associated with survival time. Compared to patients with curative treatment, patients with no tumour-directed treatment had a lower RR for pain assessment. No significant differences were shown between the treatment groups regarding hospital death, end-of-life information, oral health assessment, and bereavement support.Short survival time is associated with several indicators of low quality end-of-life care among patients with oesophageal and gastric cancer, suggesting that a proactive palliative care approach is imperative to ensure quality end-of-life care."
https://openalex.org/W3036358648,"Mutations of calreticulin (CALRm) define a subtype of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We studied the biological and genetic features of CALR-mutated essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis patients. In most cases, CALRm were found in granulocytes, monocytes, B and NK cells, but also in T cells. However, the type 1 CALRm spreads more easily than the type 2 CALRm in lymphoid cells. The CALRm were also associated with an early clonal dominance at the level of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) with no significant increase during granulo/monocytic differentiation in most cases. Moreover, we found that half of type 2 CALRm patients harbors some homozygous progenitors. Those patients were associated with a higher clonal dominance during granulo/monocytic differentiation than patients with only heterozygous type 2 CALRm progenitors. When associated mutations were present, CALRm were the first genetic event suggesting that they are both the initiating and phenotypic event. In blood, type 1 CALRm led to a greater increased number of all types of progenitors compared with the type 2 CALRm. However, both types of CALRm induced an increase in megakaryocytic progenitors associated with a ruxolitinib-sensitive independent growth and with a mild constitutive signaling in megakaryocytes. At the transcriptional level, type 1 CALRm seems to deregulate more pathways than the type 2 CALRm in megakaryocytes. Altogether, our results show that CALRm modify both the HSPC and megakaryocyte biology with a stronger effect for type 1 than for type 2 CALRm."

A total of 200 E. coli strains isolated from Mexican women with CVI from two medical units of the Mexican Institute of Social Security were analysed. E. coli strains and antibiotic resistance genes were identified using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and phylogroups were identified using multiplex PCR. Virulence gene transcription was measured through reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR after infection of the vaginal cell line A431. The most common antibiotic resistance genes among the CVEC strains were aac(3)II, TEM, dfrA1, sul1, and qnrA. The predominant phylogroup was B2. The genes most frequently transcribed in these strains were fimH, papC, irp2, iroN, kpsMTII, cnf1, and ompT, mainly in CVEC strains isolated from chronic and occasional vaginal infections. The strains showed a large diversity of transcription of the virulence genes phenotype and antibiotic resistance genotype, especially in the strains of phylogroups, B2, A, and D. The strains formed 2 large clusters, which contained several subclusters. The genetic diversity of CVEC strains was high. These strains have a large number of transcription patterns of virulence genes, and one-third of them carry three to seven antibiotic resistance genes."

It is associated with intrinsic muscular abnormalities of the lower extremities, but it is not known whether there is an easy way to predict its presence. Using a mouse model of chronic cigarette smoke exposure, we tested the hypothesis that magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows us to detect muscle bioenergetic deficit in early stages of lung disease. We employed this technique to evaluate the synthesis rate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and characterize concomitant mitochondrial dynamics patterns in the gastrocnemius muscle of emphysematous mice. The fibers type composition and citrate synthase (CtS) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX4) enzymatic activities were evaluated. We found that the rate of ATP synthesis was reduced in the distal skeletal muscle of mice exposed to cigarette smoke. Emphysematous mice showed a significant reduction in body weight gain, in the cross-sectional area of the total fiber and in the COX4 to CtS activity ratio, due to a significant increase in CtS activity of the gastrocnemius muscle. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that in the early stage of lung disease, we can detect a decrease in ATP synthesis in skeletal muscle, partly caused by high oxidative mitochondrial enzyme activity. These findings may be relevant to predict the presence of skeletal bioenergetic deficit in the early stage of lung disease besides placing the mitochondria as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of COPD comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3036331308,"Aflatoxin B1 aldehyde reductase (AFAR) enzyme activity has been associated to a higher resistance to the aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) toxicity in ethoxyquin-fed rats. However, no studies about AFAR activity and its relationship with tolerance to AFB1 have been conducted in poultry. To determine the role of AFAR in poultry tolerance, the hepatic in vitro enzymatic activity of AFAR was investigated in liver cytosol from four commercial poultry species (chicken, quail, turkey and duck). Specifically, the kinetic parameters Vmax, Km and intrinsic clearance (CLint) were determined for AFB1 dialdehyde reductase (AFB1-monoalcohol production) and AFB1 monoalcohol reductase (AFB1-dialcohol production). In all cases, AFB1 monoalcohol reductase activity saturated at the highest aflatoxin B1 dialdehyde concentration tested (66.4 μM), whereas AFB1 dialdehyde reductase did not. Both activities were highly and significantly correlated and therefore are most likely catalyzed by the same AFAR enzyme. However, it appears that production of the AFB1 monoalcohol is favored over the AFB1 dialcohol. The production of alcohols from aflatoxin dialdehyde showed the highest enzymatic efficiency (highest CLint value) in chickens, a species resistant to AFB1; however, it was also high in the turkey, a species with intermediate sensitivity; further, CLint values were lowest in another tolerant species (quail) and in the most sensitive poultry species (the duck). These results suggest that AFAR activity is related to resistance to the acute toxic effects of AFB1 only in chickens and ducks. Genetic selection of ducks for high AFAR activity could be a means to control aflatoxin sensitivity in this poultry species."

We assembled and annotated the combined larval transcriptome of ""social"" early and ""solitary"" late instars using next generation Illumina sequencing, and used this transcriptome to conduct differential gene expression analysis of the two behavioural phenotypes. A total of 211,012,294 reads generated by RNA sequencing were assembled into 231,348 transcripts and 116,079 unigenes for the functional annotation of the transcriptome. Expression analysis revealed 3300 transcripts that were differentially expressed between early and late instars, with a large proportion associated with development and metabolic processes. We independently validated differential expression patterns of selected transcripts using RT-qPCR. The expression profiles of social and solitary larvae revealed differentially expressed transcripts coding for gene products that have been previously reported to influence social behaviour in other insects (e.g. cGMP- and cAMP- dependent kinases, and bioamine receptors). This study provides the first transcriptomic resources for a lepidopteran species belonging to the superfamily Drepanoidea, and gives insight into genetic factors mediating grouping behaviour in insects."

A case study was performed at the two largest small livestock markets in Zambia: the Lusaka market in the capital and the Kasumbalesa market near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Semi-structured interviews with 47 traders performed in April-May and September 2018 represent the core material. Zambian small ruminant traders frequently trade animals that have clinical signs of disease, either because they appear unaware or indifferent to the associated risks, experience financial constraints or assign responsibility for disease prevention to other value chain actors. In their decision about whether or not to sell a visibly sick small ruminant, traders appear to consider whether the clinical sign is perceived as ‘natural’ or the result of an illness, whether the buyer is aware of the animal’s health condition, and whether the animal is sold for consumption or breeding purposes. Traders appear to regard the veterinary certificate required to transport small ruminants in Zambia as proof of health, placing the responsibility for potential disease in traded animals on the veterinary authorities. In their description of a model trader, taking good care of and being sensitive to customer needs was emphasized, indicating that an efficient way to encourage traders to change their behaviour is to influence customer demands. In contrast to the focus in previous studies on identifying and filling knowledge gaps, the present study show that lack of knowledge is not central to why traders engage in disease-transmitting behaviour. Greater awareness of other reasons for certain perceptions and practices could lead to the formulation of risk communication strategies and mitigation measures that are relevant for the local context, as well as alternative strategies for changing trader behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3036690363,"Emergency Care Networks (ECNs) were created as a response to the increased demand for emergency services and the ever-increasing waiting times experienced by patients in emergency rooms. In this sense, ECNs are called to provide a rapid diagnosis and early intervention so that poor patient outcomes, patient dissatisfaction, and cost overruns can be avoided. Nevertheless, ECNs, as nodal systems, are often inefficient due to the lack of coordination between emergency departments (EDs) and the presence of non-value added activities within each ED. This situation is even more complex in the public healthcare sector of low-income countries where emergency care is provided under constraint resources and limited innovation. Notwithstanding the tremendous efforts made by healthcare clusters and government agencies to tackle this problem, most of ECNs do not yet provide nimble and efficient care to patients. Additionally, little progress has been evidenced regarding the creation of methodological approaches that assist policymakers in solving this problem. In an attempt to address these shortcomings, this paper presents a three-phase methodology based on Discrete-event simulation, payment collateral models, and lean six sigma to support the design of in-time and economically sustainable ECNs. The proposed approach is validated in a public ECN consisting of 2 hospitals and 8 POCs (Point of Care). The results of this study evidenced that the average waiting time in an ECN can be substantially diminished by optimizing the cooperation flows between EDs."
https://openalex.org/W3036637448,"Objectives It is commonly accepted that motor imagery (MI), i.e. the mental simulation of a movement, leads to an increased size of cortical motor evoked potentials (MEPs), although the magnitude of this effect differs between studies. Its impact on the spinal level is even more variable in the literature. Such discrepancies may be explained by many different experimental approaches. Therefore, the question of the optimal stimulation parameters to assess both spinal and corticospinal excitabilities remains open. Methods H-reflexes and MEPs of the triceps surae were evoked in 11 healthy subjects during MI, weak voluntary contraction (CON) and rest (REST). In each condition, the full recruitment curve from the response threshold to maximal potential was investigated. Results At stimulation intensities close to the maximal response, MEP amplitude was increased by CON compared to REST on the triceps surae. No effect of the different conditions was found on the H-reflex recruitment curve, except a small variation beyond maximal H-reflex in the soleus muscle. Conclusion Based on our results, we recommend to assess corticospinal excitability between 70% and 100% of maximal MEP intensity instead of the classical use of a percentage of the motor threshold and to elicit H-reflexes on the ascending part of the recruitment curve."
https://openalex.org/W3036356448,"We analyze a network of needle-sharing ties among 117 people who inject drugs (PWID) in rural Puerto Rico, using exponential random graph modeling to examine whether network members engage in partner restriction to lower their risk of contracting HIV or hepatitis C (HCV), or in informed altruism to prevent others from contracting these infections. Although sharing of used syringes is a significant risk factor for transmission of these diseases among PWID, we find limited evidence for partner restriction or informed altruism in the network of reported needle-sharing ties. We find however that sharing of needles is strongly reciprocal, and individuals with higher injection frequency are more likely to have injected with a used needle. Drawing on our ethnographic work, we discuss how the network structures we observe may relate to a decision-making rationale focused on avoiding withdrawal sickness, which leads to risk-taking behaviors in this poor, rural context where economic considerations often lead PWID to cooperate in the acquisition and use of drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3036400279,"Background Residual contamination by intravenous conventional antineoplastic drugs (ICAD) is still a daily issue in hospital facilities. This study aimed to compare the efficiency (EffQ) of 4 different solutions to remove 23 widely used ICADs from surfaces. Method and findings A solution containing 23 ICADs (4 alkylating agents, 8 antimetabolites, 2 topo-I inhibitors, 6 topo-II inhibitors and 3 spindle poisons) was spread over 100 cm2 stainless steel. After drying, decontamination was carried out using 10×10 cm wipes moistened with 300 μL of one of the following solutions: 70% isopropanol (S1); ethanol-hydrogen peroxide 91.6–50.0 mg/g (S2); 10−2 M sodium dodecyl sulphate/isopropanol 80/20 (S3) or 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (S4). Six tests were performed for each decontamination solution. Two modalities were tested: a single wipe motion from top to bottom or vigorous wiping (n = 6 for each modality). Residual contamination was measured with a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection method. Solution efficiency (in %) was computed as follows: EffQ = 1–(quantity after decontamination/quantity before decontamination), as median (min–max) for the 23 ICADs. The overall decontamination efficiency (EffQ) of the 4 solutions was compared by a Kruskall-Wallis test. Decontamination modalities were compared for each solution and per ICAD with a Mann-Whitney test (p<0.05). EffQ were significantly different from one solution to the next for single wipe motion decontamination: 79.9% (69.3–100), 86.5% (13.0–100), 85.4% (56.5–100) and 100% (52.9–100) for S1, S2, S3 and S4 (p<0.0001), respectively. Differences were also significant for vigorous decontamination: EffQ of 84.3% (66.0–100), 92.3% (68.7–100), 99.6% (84.8–100) and 100% (82.9–100) for S1, S2, S3 and S4, respectively (p<0.0001). Generally, vigorous decontamination increased EffQ for all tested solutions and more significantly for the surfactant. Conclusion Decontamination efficiency depended on the solution used but also on the application modality. An SDS admixture seems to be a good alternative to sodium hypochlorite, notably after vigorous chemical decontamination with no hazard either to materials or workers."
https://openalex.org/W3036742382,"Background Umbilical cord clamping is a crucial step during the third stage of labour that separates the newborn from the placenta. Despite the available evidence that delayed umbilical cord clamping is more beneficial to infants, as well as the existence of 2014 WHO recommendation that the umbilical cord should be clamped between 1 and 3 minutes, its implementation is still low in many countries including Tanzania. Objective This study describes the experiences and perceptions of nurse-midwives`and obstetricians`about the timing of umbilical cord clamping at a regional referral hospital in Tanzania. Methods A descriptive qualitative study design that adopted a purposeful sampling strategy to recruit 19 participants was used. Nine semi-structured interviews with six nurse-midwives`and three obstetricians`, as well as one focus group discussion with ten nurse-midwives`were conducted. Thematic analysis guided the analysis of data. Results Three main themes generated from the data, each having 2 to 5 subthemes. 1. Experiences about the timing of umbilical cord clamping. 2. Perceptions about the umbilical cord clamping. 3. Factors influencing the practice of delayed umbilical cord clamping to improve newborn health outcomes. Conclusion Although the nurse-midwives`and obstetricians`commonly practiced clamping the umbilical cord immediately after delivery, they understood that delayed cord clamping has a potential benefit of oxygenation to the newborn in the event of the need for resuscitation. To move forward with the good practice in maternal and newborn care, proper pre-service and providers training on matters underlying childbirth is essential to address the gap of knowledge. Delayed cord clamping should be practiced widely to improve the health outcomes of the newborn."
https://openalex.org/W3035918262,"Background Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a common co-morbidity of obesity. Elevated TSH levels (eTSH), also associated with obesity, may contribute to the dysmetabolic state that predisposes to NAFLD. Objective To assess the relationship between TSH levels and NAFLD in children with biopsy-proven NAFLD compared to controls. Design and methods In this retrospective study of children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and age-matched controls, the association of eTSH with NAFLD was investigated and the role of TSH as a mediator between obesity and NAFLD was assessed. Results Sixty-six cases and 4067 controls (69.7 vs 59% Hispanic/Latino ancestry, p = 0.1) of the same age range seen in the same time duration at an urban Children’s Hospital were studied. Children with NAFLD were more likely to be male (74.6 vs 39.4%, p < 0.001), have higher modified BMI-z scores (median 2.4 (IQR 1.7) vs 1.9 (IQR 1.7), p < 0.001), and abnormal metabolic parameters (TSH, ALT, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, and TG). Multivariate analyses controlling for age, sex and severity of obesity showed significant association between the 4th quartile of TSH and NAFLD. Causal mediation analysis demonstrates that TSH mediates 33.8% of the effect of modified BMI-z score on NAFLD. This comprises of 16.0% (OR = 1.1, p = 0.002) caused by the indirect effect of TSH and its interaction with modified BMI-z, and 17.7% (OR = 1.1, p = 0.05) as an autonomous effect of TSH on NAFLD. Overall, 33.8% of the effect can be eliminated by removing the mediator, TSH (p = 0.001). Conclusions The association of eTSH and biopsy-proven NAFLD is demonstrated in children of Hispanic/Latino ancestry. Further, a causal mediation analysis implicates an effect of TSH on NAFLD, independent of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3036014608,"We identified the key sectors of water resource use in China from the perspective of the water footprint to improve the use of water resources. The empirical results showed that there were six key sectors (including Crop Cultivation; Forestry; Livestock and Livestock Products; Fishery, Technical Services for Agriculture, Forestry, Livestock and Fishing; Other Food Products, and Scrap and Waste) for water consumption in China in 2015.We analyzed the use of green water, blue water, and grey water. These six sectors accounted for 66.15% of the total impact and 90.76% of the direct impact. Seven key sectors (the six sectors above plus Steel Processing)for the consumption of blue water in China can explain 59.70% of the total impact and 86.94% of the direct effect in 2015. Eight key sectors (Crop cultivation, Other food products, Scrap and Waste, Railway Freight Transport, Highway Freight and Passengers Transport, Water Freight and Passengers Transport, Pipeline Transport, and Health Services) responsible for the consumption of grey water in China in 2015 can explain 81.28% of the total impact and 95.73% of the direct impact. Therefore, the Chinese government should focus on the departments that manage water resources in these sectors when designing water-saving policies and improving water-use efficiency, such as promoting water-saving irrigation technology (including sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation) in the agricultural sector."
https://openalex.org/W3036188166,"Conservation planning often involves multiple species occupying large areas including habitat sites with varying characteristics. For a given amount of financial resources, designing a spatially coherent nature reserve system that provides the best possible protection to targeted species is an important ecological and economic problem. In this paper, we address this problem using optimization methods. Incorporating spatial criteria in an optimization framework considering spatial habitat needs of multiple species poses serious challenges because of modeling and computational complexities. We present a novel linear integer programming model to address this issue considering spatial contiguity and compactness of the reserved area. The model uses the concept of path in graph theory to ensure contiguity and minimizes the sum of distances between selected sites and a central site in individual reserves to promote compactness. We test the computational efficiency of the model using randomly generated data sets. The results show that the model can be solved quite efficiently in most cases. We also present an empirical application of the model to simultaneous protection of two cohabiting species, Gopher Tortoise and Gopher Frogs, in a military installation in Georgia, USA."
https://openalex.org/W3036638534,"Purpose We aim to develop a robust 4D MRI method for large FOVs enabling the extraction of irregular respiratory motion that is readily usable with all MRI machines and thus applicable to support a wide range of interventional settings. Method We propose a 4D MRI reconstruction method to capture an arbitrary number of breathing states. It uses template updates in navigator slices and search regions for fast and robust vessel cross-section tracking. It captures FOVs of 255 mm x 320 mm x 228 mm at a spatial resolution of 1.82 mm x 1.82 mm x 4mm and temporal resolution of 200ms. A total of 37 4D MRIs of 13 healthy subjects were reconstructed to validate the method. A quantitative evaluation of the reconstruction rate and speed of both the new and baseline method was performed. Additionally, a study with ten radiologists was conducted to assess the subjective reconstruction quality of both methods. Results Our results indicate improved mean reconstruction rates compared to the baseline method (79.4% vs. 45.5%) and improved mean reconstruction times (24s vs. 73s) per subject. Interventional radiologists perceive the reconstruction quality of our method as higher compared to the baseline (262.5 points vs. 217.5 points, p = 0.02). Conclusions Template updates are an effective and efficient way to increase 4D MRI reconstruction rates and to achieve better reconstruction quality. Search regions reduce reconstruction time. These improvements increase the applicability of 4D MRI as a base for seamless support of interventional image guidance in percutaneous interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3036806718,"Different modes of exogenous electrical stimulation at physiological strength has been applied to various diseases. Previously, we extensively demonstrated the usability of mild electrical stimulation (MES) with low frequency pulse current at 55 pulses per second (MES55) for several disease conditions. Here we found that MES with high frequency pulse-current (5500 pulse per second; MES5500) suppressed the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin in Jurkat T cells and primary splenocytes. MES5500 also suppressed the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, improved liver damage and reduced mouse spleen enlargement in concanavalin-A-treated BALB/c mice. The molecular mechanism underlying these effects included the ability of MES5500 to induce modest amount of hydrogen peroxide and control multiple signaling pathways important for immune regulation, such as NF-κB, NFAT and NRF2. In the treatment of various inflammatory and immune-related diseases, suppression of excessive inflammatory cytokines is key, but because immunosuppressive drugs used in the clinical setting have serious side effects, development of safer methods of inhibiting cytokines is required. Our finding provides evidence that physical medicine in the form of MES5500 may be considered as a novel therapeutic tool or as adjunctive therapy for inflammatory and immune-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3036830529,"The left ventricular (LV) end-systolic (ES) pressure volume relationship (ESPVR) is the cornerstone of systolic LV function analysis. We describe a 2D real-time (RT) MRI-based method (RTPVR) with separate software tools for 1) semi-automatic level set-based shape prior method (LSSPM) of the LV, 2) generation of synchronized pressure area loops and 3) calculation of the ESPVR. We used the RTPVR method to measure ventricular geometry, ES pressure area relationship (ESPAR) and ESPVR during vena cava occlusion (VCO) in normal sheep. 14 adult sheep were anesthetized and underwent measurement of LV systolic function. Ten of the 14 sheep underwent RTMRI and eight of the 14 underwent measurement with conductance catheter; 4 had both RTMRI and conductance measurements. 2D cross sectional RTMRI were performed at apex, mid-ventricle and base levels during separate VCOs. The Dice similarity coefficient was used to compare LSSPM and manual image segmentation and thus determine LSSPM accuracy. LV cross-sectional area, major and minor axis length, axis ratio, major axis orientation angle and ESPAR were measured at each LV level. ESPVR was calculated with a trapezoidal rule. The Dice similarity coefficient between LSSPM and manual segmentation by two readers was 87.31±2.51% and 88.13±3.43%. All cross sections became more elliptical during VCO. The major axis orientation shifted during VCO but remained in the septo-lateral direction. LV chamber obliteration at the apical level occurred during VCO in 7 of 10 sheep that underwent RTMRI. ESPAR was non-linear at all levels. Finally, ESPVR was non-linear because of apical collapse. ESPVR measured by conductance catheter (EES,Index = 2.23±0.66 mmHg/ml/m2) and RT (EES,Index = 2.31±0.31 mmHg/ml/m2) was not significantly different. LSSPM segmentation of 2D RT MRI images is accurate and allows calculation of LV geometry, ESPAR and ESPVR during VCO. In the future, RTPVR will facilitate determination of regional systolic material parameters underlying ESPVR."
https://openalex.org/W3036919144,"Background Access to and engagement in high-quality HIV medical care and treatment is essential for ending the HIV epidemic. The Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) plays a critical role in ensuring that people living with diagnosed HIV (PLWH) are linked to and consistently engaged in high quality care and receive HIV medication in a timely manner. State variation in HIV prevalence, the proportion of PLWH served by the RWHAP, and local health care environments could influence the state-specific impact of the RWHAP. This analysis sought to measure the state-specific impact of the RWHAP on the HIV service delivery system and health outcomes for PLWH, and presents template language to communicate this impact for state planning and stakeholder engagement. Methods and findings The HRSA’s HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‘s Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (CDC DHAP) have developed a mathematical model to estimate the state-specific impact of the RWHAP. This model was parameterized using RWHAP data, HIV surveillance data, an existing CDC model of HIV transmission and disease progression, and parameters from the literature. In this study, the model was used to analyze the hypothetical scenario of an absence of the RWHAP and to calculate the projected impact of this scenario on RWHAP clients, RWHAP-funded providers, mortality, new HIV cases, and costs compared with the current state inclusive of the RWHAP. To demonstrate the results of the model, we selected two states, representing high HIV prevalence and low HIV prevalence areas. These states serve to demonstrate the functionality of the model and how state-specific results can be translated into a state-specific impact statement using template language. Conclusions In the example states presented, the RWHAP provides HIV care, treatment, and support services to a large proportion of PLWH in each state. The absence of the RWHAP in these states could result in substantially more deaths and HIV cases than currently observed, resulting in considerable lifetime HIV care and treatment costs associated with additional HIV cases. State-specific impact statements may be valuable in the development of state-level HIV prevention and care plans or for communications with planning bodies, state health department leadership, and other stakeholders. State-specific impact statements will be available to RWHAP Part B recipients upon request from HRSA’s HIV/AIDS Bureau."
https://openalex.org/W3035907031,"Background Allograft vasculopathy (AV) remains a major obstacle to long-term allograft survival. While the mouse aortic transplantation model has been proven as a useful tool for study of the pathogenesis of AV, simultaneous transplantation of the aorta alongside the transplantation of another organ may reveal more clinically relevant mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic allograft rejection. Therefore, we developed a combined abdominal heart and aorta transplantation model in mice which benefits from reducing animal and drug utilization, while providing an improved model to study the progressive nature of AV. Methods The middle of the infrarenal aorta of the recipient mouse was ligatured between the renal artery and its bifurcation. Proximal and distal aortotomies were performed at this site above and below the ligature, respectively, for the subsequent anastomoses of the donor aorta and heart grafts to the recipient infrarenal aorta in an end-to-side fashion. The distal anastomotic site of the recipient infrarenal aorta was connected with the outlet of the donor aorta. Uniquely, the proximal anastomotic site on the recipient infrarenal aorta was shared to connect with both the inlet of the donor aorta and the inflow tract to the donor heart. The outflow tract from the donor heart was connected to the recipient inferior vena cava (IVC). Results The median times for harvesting the heart graft, aorta graft, recipient preparation and anastomosis were 11.5, 8.0, 9.0 and 40.5 min, respectively, resulting in a total median ischemic time of 70 min. The surgery survival rate was more than 96% (29/30). Both the syngeneic C57Bl/6 aorta and heart grafts survived more than 90 days in 29 C57Bl/6 recipients. Further, Balb/c to C57Bl/6 allografts treated with anti-CD40L and CTLA4.Ig survived more than 90 days with a 100% (3/3) survival rate. (3/3). Conclusions This model is presented as a new tool for researchers to investigate transplant immunology and assess immunosuppressive strategies. It is possible to share a common anastomotic stoma on the recipient abdominal aorta to reconstruct both the aorta graft entrance and heart graft inflow tract. This allows for the study of allogeneic effects on both the aorta and heart from the same animal in a single survival surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3036093680,"In humans, mutations in genes encoding homologs of the DNA mismatch repair endonuclease MutL cause a hereditary cancer that is known as Lynch syndrome. Here, we determined the crystal structures of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of MutL from the thermophilic eubacterium Aquifex aeolicus (aqMutL) complexed with ATP analogs at 1.69–1.73 A. The structures revealed significant structural similarities to those of a human MutL homolog, postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2). We introduced five Lynch syndrome-associated mutations clinically found in human PMS2 into the aqMutL NTD and investigated the protein stability, ATPase activity, and DNA-binding ability of these protein variants. Among the mutations studied, the most unexpected results were obtained for the residue Ser34. Ser34 (Ser46 in PMS2) is located at a previously identified Bergerat ATP-binding fold. We found that the S34I aqMutL NTD retains ATPase and DNA-binding activities. Interestingly, CD spectrometry and trypsin-limited proteolysis indicated the disruption of a secondary structure element of the S34I NTD, destabilizing the overall structure of the aqMutL NTD. In agreement with this, the recombinant human PMS2 S46I NTD was easily digested in the host Escherichia coli cells. Moreover, other mutations resulted in reduced DNA-binding or ATPase activity. In summary, using the thermostable aqMutL protein as a model molecule, we have experimentally determined the effects of the mutations on MutL endonuclease; we discuss the pathological effects of the corresponding mutations in human PMS2."
https://openalex.org/W3036573870,"There is a need to identify priority zones for cardiometabolic prevention. Disease mapping in countries with high heterogeneity in the geographic distribution of the population is challenging. Our goal was to map the cardiometabolic health and identify hotspots of disease using data from a national health survey.Using Chile as a case study, we applied a Bayesian hierarchical modelling. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2009-2010 Chilean Health Survey. Outcomes were diabetes (all types), obesity, hypertension, and high LDL cholesterol. To estimate prevalence, we used individual and aggregated data by province. We identified hotspots defined as prevalence in provinces significantly greater than the national prevalence. Models were adjusted for age, sex, their interaction, and sampling weight. We imputed missing data. We applied a joint outcome modelling approach to capture the association between the four outcomes.We analysed data from 4,780 participants (mean age (SD) 46 (19) years; 60% women). The national prevalence (percentage (95% credible intervals) for diabetes, obesity, hypertension and high LDL cholesterol were 10.9 (4.5, 19.2), 30.0 (17.7, 45.3), 36.4 (16.4, 57.6), and 13.7 (3.4, 32.2) respectively. Prevalence of diabetes was lower in the far south. Prevalence of obesity and hypertension increased from north to far south. Prevalence of high LDL cholesterol was higher in the north and south. A hotspot for diabetes was located in the centre. Hotspots for obesity were mainly situated in the south and far south, for hypertension in the centre, south and far south and for high LDL cholesterol in the far south.The distribution of cardiometabolic risk factors in Chile has a characteristic pattern with a general trend to a north-south gradient. Our approach is reproducible and demonstrates that the Bayesian approach enables the accurate identification of hotspots and mapping of disease, allowing the identification of areas for cardiometabolic prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3036902709,"Linguistic negation acts by inhibiting the representation of information under its scope, often leading to the representation of positive alternative states of affairs. Motivational direction refers to approach/avoidance intentionality in our interactions with environmental stimuli expressed by means of verbs (e.g., ""accept"" vs ""reject""). We consider it plausible that negation interacts with direction to represent the true motivation of the protagonist in sentence understanding (e.g., if an approach action is negated it is represented as avoidance). In the first study, we examine this interaction offline by asking participants to judge approach or avoidance meaning of affirmative (e.g., ""he/she included/excluded meat"") and negative sentences (""he/she did not include/exclude meat""). Results support that negation reversed participants' interpretation of sentence motivational direction. In a further study, we carried out two probe recognition experiments to examine the interaction during sentence comprehension; in both, the critical probe was the word referring to the target of the action (e.g., ""meat""). In the first experiment, participants had to recognize the probe word presented 1500 milliseconds after sentence offset, while for the second one, the delay was 500 milliseconds. Results showed that at 1500 ms, target recognition took significantly more time for negated avoidance sentences than for the other conditions. Therefore, representing negated avoidance sentences seems to imply more complex processing, as avoidance verbs would be implicitly negative. By contrast, at the 500 ms delay, negation impaired target recognition for both approach and avoidance sentences, suggesting an unspecific inhibitory effect of negation at that sentence processing stage. Implication of these results for both research on negation and in action understanding are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3036726026,"Acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), limits the use of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) to treat a variety of malignancies. Any new therapeutic approach must satisfy three requirements: 1) Prevent GVHD, 2) Maintain anti-pathogen immunity, and 3) Maintain anti-tumor immunity. In prior studies we have shown that the selective photosensitizer 2-Se-Cl eliminates highly alloreactive lymphocytes from the graft prior to HCT preventing GVHD and that antiviral immune responses were preserved following incubation with 2-Se-Cl. In this report, we investigated whether 2-Se-Cl treatment preserves antitumor immunity, and then used high dimensional flow cytometry to identify the determinants of successful immune reconstitution. Donor C57BL/6 splenocytes were cocultured for 4 days with irradiated BALB/c splenocytes and then exposed to 2-Se-Cl. Photodepletion (PD)-treated splenocytes were then infused into lethally irradiated BALB/c mice inoculated with A20 leukemia/lymphoma cells. Recipient mice that received PD-treated splenocytes survived > 100 days without evidence of GVHD or leukemia. In contrast, mice that did not receive PD-treated cells at time of HCT died of leukemia progression. Multiparameter flow cytometry of cytokines and surface markers on peripheral blood samples 15 days after HCT demonstrated unique patterns of immune reconstitution. We found that before clinical disease onset GVHD was marked by functionally exhausted T cells, while tumor clearance and long-term survival were associated with an expansion of polyfunctional T cells, monocytes, and DCs early after transplantation. Taken together these results demonstrate that 2-Se-Cl photodepletion is a new treatment that can facilitate HCT by preventing GVHD while preserving antiviral and anti-tumor immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3036150880,"To evaluate the impact of hypermutation on the HIV-1 dissemination at the population level we studied 7072 sequences HIV-1 gene vif retrieved from the public databank. From this dataset 854 sequences were selected because they had associated values of CD4+ T lymphocytes counts and viral loads and they were used to assess the correlation between clinical parameters and hypermutation. We found that the frequency of stop codons at sites 5, 11 and 79 ranged from 2.8x10-4 to 4.2x10-4. On the other hand, at codons 21, 38, 70, 89 and 174 the frequency of stop codons ranged from 1.4x10-3 to 2.5x10-3. We also found a correlation between clinical parameters and hypermutation where patients harboring proviruses with one or more stop codons at the tryptophan sites of the gene vif had higher CD4+ T lymphocytes counts and lower viral loads compared to the population. Our findings indicate that A3 activity potentially restrains HIV-1 replication because individuals with hypermutated proviruses tend to have lower numbers of RNA copies. However, owing to the low frequency of hypermutated sequences observed in the databank (44 out of 7072), it is unlikely that A3 has a significant impact to curb HIV-1 dissemination at the population level."
