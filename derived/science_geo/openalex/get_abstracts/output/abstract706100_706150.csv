https://openalex.org/W4311459605,"Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an attractive drug development target because of its role in the immune response, neuropathy, and cancer. Knockout mice develop normally and have no apparent phenotype, suggesting that selective inhibitors should have an excellent therapeutic window. Unfortunately, current HDAC6 inhibitors have only moderate selectivity and may inhibit other HDAC subtypes at high concentrations, potentially leading to side effects. Recently, substituted oxadiazoles have attracted attention as a promising novel HDAC inhibitor chemotype, but their mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we show that compounds containing a difluoromethyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (DFMO) moiety are potent and single-digit nanomolar inhibitors with an unprecedented greater than 104-fold selectivity for HDAC6 over all other HDAC subtypes. By combining kinetics, X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometry, we found that DFMO derivatives are slow-binding substrate analogs of HDAC6 that undergo an enzyme-catalyzed ring opening reaction, forming a tight and long-lived enzyme-inhibitor complex. The elucidation of the mechanism of action of DFMO derivatives paves the way for the rational design of highly selective inhibitors of HDAC6 and possibly of other HDAC subtypes as well with potentially important therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W4311475743,"Protein phase separation is thought to be a primary driving force for the formation of membrane-less organelles, which control a wide range of biological functions from stress response to ribosome biogenesis. Among phase-separating (PS) proteins, many have intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that are needed for phase separation to occur. Accurate identification of IDRs that drive phase separation is important for testing the underlying mechanisms of phase separation, identifying biological processes that rely on phase separation, and designing sequences that modulate phase separation. To identify IDRs that drive phase separation, we first curated datasets of folded, ID, and PS ID sequences. We then used these sequence sets to examine how broadly existing amino acid property scales can be used to distinguish between the three classes of protein regions. We found that there are robust property differences between the classes and, consequently, that numerous combinations of amino acid property scales can be used to make robust predictions of protein phase separation. This result indicates that multiple, redundant mechanisms contribute to the formation of phase-separated droplets from IDRs. The top-performing scales were used to further optimize our previously developed predictor of PS IDRs, ParSe. We then modified ParSe to account for interactions between amino acids and obtained reasonable predictive power for mutations that have been designed to test the role of amino acid interactions in driving protein phase separation. Collectively, our findings provide further insight into the classification of IDRs and the elements involved in protein phase separation."
https://openalex.org/W4311912035,"Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) is a life-threatening acute condition that has an overall in-hospital mortality rate of up to 75%. Critically ill patients are often admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) due to shock, and these patients are frequently at risk of developing NOMI. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical features of critically ill patients with NOMI and evaluate the risk factors for in-hospital mortality among these patients.We reviewed the electronic medical records of 7,346 patients who underwent abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography during their ICU stay at Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea) between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2019. After reviewing each patient's computed tomography (CT) scans, 60 patients were diagnosed with NOMI and included in this analysis. The patients were divided into survivor (n = 23) and non-survivor (n = 37) groups according to the in-hospital mortality.The overall sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score for the included patients upon admission to the ICU was 8.6 ± 3.1, and medical ICU admissions were most common (66.7%) among the patients. The SOFA score upon admission to the ICU was higher for the non-survivors than for the survivors (9.4 vs. 7.4; p = 0.017). Non-survivors were more often observed in the medical ICU admissions (39.1% vs. 83.8%) than in the surgical ICU admissions (47.8% vs. 10.8%) or the cardiac ICU admissions (13.0% vs. 5.4%). Laboratory test results, abdominal CT findings, and the use of vasopressors and inotropes did not differ between the two groups. In a multivariable analysis, SOFA scores >8 upon admission to the ICU (odds ratio [OR] 4.51; 95% 1.12-18.13; p = 0.034), patients admitted to the ICU with medical problems (OR 7.99; 95% 1.73-36.94; p = 0.008), and abdominal pain (OR 4.26; 95% 1.05-17.35; p = 0.043) were significant prognostic predictors for in-hospital mortality.The SOFA score >8 upon admission to the ICU, admission to the ICU for medical problems, and abdominal pain at diagnosis are associated with increased mortality among patients with NOMI."
https://openalex.org/W4311942622,"Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that are known to infect most types of animals. Many species of microsporidia can infect multiple related hosts, but it is not known if microsporidia express different genes depending upon which host species is infected or if the host response to infection is specific to each microsporidia species. To address these questions, we took advantage of two species of Nematocida microsporidia, N . parisii and N . ausubeli , that infect two species of Caenorhabditis nematodes, C . elegans and C . briggsae . We performed RNA-seq at several time points for each host infected with either microsporidia species. We observed that Nematocida transcription was largely independent of its host. We also observed that the host transcriptional response was similar when infected with either microsporidia species. Finally, we analyzed if the host response to microsporidia infection was conserved across host species. We observed that although many of the genes upregulated in response to infection are not direct orthologs, the same expanded gene families are upregulated in both Caenorhabditis hosts. Together our results describe the transcriptional interactions of Nematocida infection in Caenorhabditis hosts and demonstrate that these responses are evolutionarily conserved."
https://openalex.org/W4311544045,"Karyopherin-β2 (Kapβ2) is a nuclear-import receptor that recognizes proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signals of diverse cytoplasmic cargo for transport to the nucleus. Kapβ2 cargo includes several disease-linked RNA-binding proteins with prion-like domains, such as FUS, TAF15, EWSR1, hnRNPA1, and hnRNPA2. These RNA-binding proteins with prion-like domains are linked via pathology and genetics to debilitating degenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and multisystem proteinopathy. Remarkably, Kapβ2 prevents and reverses aberrant phase transitions of these cargoes, which is cytoprotective. However, the molecular determinants of Kapβ2 that enable these activities remain poorly understood, particularly from the standpoint of nuclear-import receptor architecture. Kapβ2 is a super-helical protein comprised of 20 HEAT repeats. Here, we design truncated variants of Kapβ2 and assess their ability to antagonize FUS aggregation and toxicity in yeast and FUS condensation at the pure protein level and in human cells. We find that HEAT repeats 8 to 20 of Kapβ2 recapitulate all salient features of Kapβ2 activity. By contrast, Kapβ2 truncations lacking even a single cargo-binding HEAT repeat display reduced activity. Thus, we define a minimal Kapβ2 construct for delivery in adeno-associated viruses as a potential therapeutic for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, multisystem proteinopathy, and related disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4311914314,"Key targets of both the therapeutic and abused properties of opioids are μ-opioid receptors (MORs). Despite years of research investigating the biochemistry and signal transduction pathways associated with MOR activation, we do not fully understand the cellular mechanisms underlying opioid addiction. Given that addictive opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, heroin, and fentanyl all activate MORs, and current therapies such as naloxone and buprenorphine block this activation, the availability of tools to mechanistically investigate opioid-mediated cellular and behavioral phenotypes are necessary. Therefore, we derived, validated, and applied a novel MOR-specific Cre mouse line, inserting a T2A cleavable peptide sequence and the Cre coding sequence into the MOR 3’UTR. Importantly, this line shows specificity and fidelity of MOR expression throughout the brain and with respect to function, there were no differences in behavioral responses to morphine when compared to wild type mice, nor are there any alterations in Oprm 1 gene expression or receptor density. To assess Cre recombinase activity, MOR-Cre mice were crossed with the floxed GFP-reporters, Rosa LSLSun1-sfGFP or Rosa LSL-GFP-L10a . The latter allowed for cell type specific RNA sequencing via TRAP (Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification) of striatal MOR+ neurons following opioid withdrawal. The breadth of utility of this new tool will greatly facilitate the study of opioid biology under varying conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4311942178,"We developed a method for altering terrain unevenness on a treadmill to study gait kinematics. Terrain consisted of rigid polyurethane disks (12.7 cm diameter, 1.3-3.8 cm tall) which attached to the treadmill belt using hook-and-loop fasteners. Here, we tested four terrain unevenness conditions: Flat, Low, Medium, and High. The main objective was to test the hypothesis that increasing the unevenness of the terrain would result in greater gait kinematic variability. Seventeen younger adults (age 20-40 years), 25 higher-functioning older adults (age 65+ years), and 29 lower-functioning older adults (age 65+ years, Short Physical Performance Battery score < 10) participated. We customized the treadmill speed to each participant's walking ability, keeping the speed constant across all four terrain conditions. Participants completed two 3-minute walking trials per condition. Using an inertial measurement unit placed over the sacrum and pressure sensors in the shoes, we calculated the stride-to-stride variability in step duration and sacral excursion (coefficient of variation; standard deviation expressed as percentage of the mean). Participants also self-reported their perceived stability for each condition. Terrain was a significant predictor of step duration variability, which roughly doubled from Flat to High terrain for all participant groups: younger adults (Flat 4.0%, High 8.2%), higher-functioning older adults (Flat 5.0%, High 8.9%), lower-functioning older adults (Flat 7.0%, High 14.1%). Similarly, all groups exhibited significant increases in sacral excursion variability for the Medium and High uneven terrain conditions, compared to Flat. Participants were also significantly more likely to report feeling less stable walking over all three uneven terrain conditions compared to Flat. These findings support the hypothesis that altering terrain unevenness on a treadmill will increase gait kinematic variability and reduce perceived stability in younger and older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4311942699,"Human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASC) secretome display various therapeutically relevant effects in regenerative medicine, such as induction of angiogenesis and tissue repair. The benefits of hASC secretome are primarily orchestrated by trophic factors that mediate autocrine and paracrine effects in host cells. However, the composition and the innate characteristics of hASC secretome can be highly variable depending on the culture conditions. Here, we evaluated the combined effect of serum-free media and hypoxia preconditioning on the hASCs secretome composition and biological effects on angiogenesis and wound healing. The hASCs were cultured in serum-free media under normoxic (NCM) or hypoxic (HCM) preconditioning. The proteomic profile showed that pro- and anti-antiangiogenic factors were detected in NCM and HCM secretomes. In vitro studies demonstrated that hASCs secretomes enhanced endothelial proliferation, survival, migration, in vitro tube formation, and in vivo Matrigel plug angiogenesis. In a full-thickness skin-wound mouse model, injection of either NCM or HCM significantly accelerated the wound healing. Finally, hASC secretomes were potent in increasing endothelial density and vascular coverage of resident pericytes expressing NG2 and nestin to the lesion site, potentially contributing to blood vessel maturation. Overall, our data suggest that serum-free media or hypoxic preconditioning enhances the vascular regenerative effects of hASC secretome in a preclinical wound healing model."
https://openalex.org/W4311456012,"Shiga toxin 2a (Stx2a) is the virulence factor of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. The catalytic A1 subunit of Stx2a (Stx2A1) interacts with the ribosomal P-stalk for loading onto the ribosome and depurination of the sarcin–ricin loop, which halts protein synthesis. Because of the intrinsic flexibility of the P-stalk, a structure of the Stx2a–P-stalk complex is currently unknown. We demonstrated that the native P-stalk pentamer binds to Stx2a with nanomolar affinity, and we employed cryo-EM to determine a structure of the 72 kDa Stx2a complexed with the P-stalk. The structure identifies Stx2A1 residues involved in binding and reveals that Stx2a is anchored to the P-stalk via only the last six amino acids from the C-terminal domain of a single P-protein. For the first time, the cryo-EM structure shows the loop connecting Stx2A1 and Stx2A2, which is critical for activation of the toxin. Our principal component analysis of the cryo-EM data reveals the intrinsic dynamics of the Stx2a–P-stalk interaction, including conformational changes in the P-stalk binding site occurring upon complex formation. Our computational analysis unveils the propensity for structural rearrangements within the C-terminal domain, with its C-terminal six amino acids transitioning from a random coil to an α-helix upon binding to Stx2a. In conclusion, our cryo-EM structure sheds new light into the dynamics of the Stx2a–P-stalk interaction and indicates that the binding interface between Stx2a and the P-stalk is the potential target for drug discovery.

Shiga toxin (Stx) producing Escherichia coli (STEC), such as E. coli O157:H7 and Shigella dysenteriae are emerging foodborne pathogens, which cause severe morbidity and mortality among millions of people worldwide (1Boerlin P. McEwen S.A. Boerlin-Petzold F. Wilson J.B. Johnson R.P. Gyles C.L. Associations between virulence factors of Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia coli and disease in humans.J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 497-503Google Scholar, 2Siegler R. Oakes R. Hemolytic uremic syndrome; pathogenesis, treatment, and outcome.Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2005; 17: 200-204Google Scholar). The recent outbreaks of STEC infections in the United States and the emergence of highly virulent and antibiotic-resistant strains highlight the importance of these pathogens for food safety and public health (3Cointe A. Birgy A. Mariani-Kurkdjian P. Liguori S. Courroux C. Blanco J. et al.Emerging multidrug-resistant hybrid pathotype shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O80 and related strains of clonal complex 165, europe.Emerg. Infect.

STEC infections can result in gastrointestinal disease such as hemorrhagic colitis and may progress to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (1Boerlin P. McEwen S.A. Boerlin-Petzold F. Wilson J.B. Johnson R.P. Gyles C.L. Associations between virulence factors of Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia coli and disease in humans.J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 497-503Google Scholar). There are no therapeutics against STEC infections. Stxs are the virulence factors of STEC, and their release is critical for the development of HUS. There are two main groups of Stx toxins, Stx1a and Stx2a, both encoded by lysogenic lambdoid phages (5O'Brien A.D. Newland J.W. Miller S.F. Holmes R.K. Smith H.W. Formal S.B. Shiga-like toxin-converting phages from Escherichia coli strains that cause hemorrhagic colitis or infantile diarrhea.Science. 1984; 226: 694-696Google Scholar). Although Stx1a and Stx2a are similar in structure and function, Stx2a is more often associated with progression to severe disease such as HUS (2Siegler R. Oakes R. Hemolytic uremic syndrome; pathogenesis, treatment, and outcome.Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2005; 17: 200-204Google Scholar). Stx2a holotoxin is a ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP), which belongs to a family of AB5 toxins, consisting of a monomeric A subunit (Stx2A) and a pentameric B subunit (Stx2B). Stx2B binds to globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) located on the surface of target cells. After binding, the holotoxin is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and traffics to the Golgi apparatus, where Stx2A is cleaved into catalytically active A1 (Stx2A1) and nonactive A2 (Stx2A2) fragments, at the furin-sensitive loop connecting the two fragments (6Bergan J. Dyve Lingelem A.B. Simm R. Skotland T. Sandvig K. Shiga toxins.Toxicon. 2012; 60: 1085-1107Google Scholar, 7Johannes L. Romer W. Shiga toxins-from cell biology to biomedical applications.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 105-116Google Scholar). After the proteolytic cleavage, the structure of Stx2a remains intact because of a disulfide bond connecting Stx2A1 and Stx2A2 and the binding of Stx2A2 to Stx2B. The holotoxin is then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the disulfide bond is reduced, leading to dissociation of Stx2A1 from Stx2A2 to Stx2B. Subsequently, Stx2A1 undergoes retrotranslocation from the ER to the cytosol, where it associates with the ribosomal P-stalk. The ribosomal P-stalk is the main landing platform for RIPs on the eukaryotic ribosome. The P-stalk is composed of five P-proteins, namely uL10 protein (former name P0) (8Ban N. Beckmann R. Cate J.H. Dinman J.D. Dragon F. Ellis S.R. et al.A new system for naming ribosomal proteins.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2014; 24: 165-169Google Scholar) forming the base of the stalk, and two P1–P2 heterodimers, each binding to uL10 (9Gonzalo P. Reboud J.P. The puzzling lateral flexible stalk of the ribosome.Biol. Cell. 2003; 95: 179-193Google Scholar, 10Tchorzewski M. The acidic ribosomal P proteins.Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol. 2002; 34: 911-915Google Scholar). The P-stalk confers extraordinary specificity for the RIPs toward the eukaryotic ribosome (11Chiou J.C. Li X.P. Remacha M. Ballesta J.P. Tumer N.E. The ribosomal stalk is required for ribosome binding, depurination of the rRNA and cytotoxicity of ricin A chain in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1441-1452Google Scholar). Each P-protein consists of a structured N-terminal domain (NTD) and an unstructured C-terminal domain (CTD). Because of the intrinsic flexibility of the ribosomal P-stalk, particularly in the CTDs of the ribosomal P-proteins, its structure has not yet been solved (12Grela P. Gajda M.J. Armache J.P. Beckmann R. Krokowski D. Svergun D.I. et al.Solution structure of the natively assembled yeast ribosomal stalk determined by small-angle X-ray scattering.Biochem.

Tumer N.E. Human ribosomal P1-P2 heterodimer represents an optimal docking site for ricin A chain with a prominent role for P1 C-terminus.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 5608-5619Google Scholar). This interaction triggers a conformational change in the CTD, which loads Stx2A1 onto the sarcin–ricin loop (SRL) of 28S rRNA in the large ribosomal subunit (Fig. 1). The binding of Stx2A1 to the SRL is mediated via its N-glycosidase active site. The active and the P-stalk-binding sites are located on the opposite surfaces of Stx2A1 (Fig. 1). Stx2A1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond in the conserved SRL adenine 2660/3027 (E. coli/Saccharomyces cerevisiae) causing its depurination. Mechanistic outcome of depurination is distortion of the conformation of SRL, which in turn affects the binding and activity of translational GTPases (trGTPases), subsequently leading to inhibition of the elongation step in protein synthesis (19Endo Y.

In the current study, we employed cryo-EM and biophysical methods to examine the interaction between Stx2a and the P-stalk pentamer. Recent advances in cryo-EM provide unprecedented insights into structures of macromolecular complexes; however, structure determination of sub-100 kDa biomolecules continues to present considerable difficulties (21Wu M. Lander G.C. How low can we go? Structure determination of small biological complexes using single-particle cryo-EM.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2020; 64: 9-16Google Scholar, 22Zhang K. Li S. Kappel K.

Here, the state-of-the-art instrumentation and multiple software processing platforms (23DiIorio C. Kulczyk A.W. A robust single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) processing workflow with cryoSPARC, RELION and scipion.J. Vis.

Cryo-EM structure of the replisome reveals multiple interactions coordinating DNA synthesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E1848-E1856Google Scholar) were used to determine a 4.1 Å cryo-EM structure of the 72 kDa Stx2a in complex with the ribosomal P-stalk, with local resolutions in the range of 3.5 to 7.5 Å. The structure shows that only a short six amino-acid fragment from the CTD of a single P-protein is involved in complex formation. In addition, the structure reveals a number of novel features including the so-far unidentified Stx2A1 residues involved in binding to the CTD and a flexible loop connecting the Stx2A1 and Stx2A2 fragments. For the first time, we show that the Stx2a–P-stalk interaction is intrinsically dynamic, with conformational changes occurring in the P-stalk-binding site of Stx2a upon complex formation. The cryo-EM structure of Stx2a–P-stalk is the first structure of any RIP in complex with the native ribosomal P-stalk. The structure provides insights into the dynamic nature of the Stx2a–P-stalk interaction and indicates that the Stx2a–P-stalk interface is a new potential target for drug discovery. We employed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to examine the interaction of Stx2a with the native ribosomal P-stalk isolated from S. cerevisiae. The pentameric P-stalk complex was obtained from the genetically engineered yeast strain, in which the gene for uL10 was modified such that the thrombin cleavage site and the 6xHis tag were introduced into the uL10 protruding domain (Fig. 2A), thus enabling the release of the natively assembled P-stalk from the ribosome by thrombin treatment (25Krokowski D. Boguszewska A. Abramczyk D. Liljas A. Tchorzewski M. Grankowski N. Yeast ribosomal P0 protein has two separate binding sites for P1/P2 proteins.Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 386-400Google Scholar). The P-stalk complex was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2B). The purified P-stalk had a stable pentameric organization, as evidenced by native PAGE (Fig. 2C) and native mass spectrometry (Fig. 2D), with a molecular mass of 56.5 kDa. To examine the interaction of Stx2a with the P-stalk, we immobilized Stx2a on the surface of the SPR chip and injected the P-stalk pentamer at the concentration ranging from 62.5 to 2 μM (Fig. 2E). The KD obtained by fitting the binding curves at steady state is 823 nM (Fig. 2F). The interaction displays fast on/off kinetics, the fact confirmed by binding measurements performed using a single-cycle injection method (Fig. S1A). We also measured the binding between Stx2a and P11 (Fig. S2B). The P11 was previously cocrystallized with Stx2a (20Rudolph M.J. Davis S.A. Tumer N.E. Li X.P. Structural basis for the interaction of Shiga toxin 2a with a C-terminal peptide of ribosomal P stalk proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 15588-15596Google Scholar). The KD for Stx2a–P11 interaction is 48 μM (Fig. S2C). Thus, Stx2a binds to the P-stalk pentamer with nearly 60-fold higher affinity than it does to P11, demonstrating that the native P-stalk represents the optimal binding partner for Stx2a. Stx2–P-stalk samples were assessed by negative-stain EM. Resultant micrographs showed approximately 500 to 800 particles well dispersed across the field of view (Fig. S2), confirming that Stx2a–P-stalk is a good target for cryo-EM structure determination. To ensure the complex is formed on EM grids, we mixed both components at the concentration approximately 20 times higher than the KD for the complex formation. For image processing and structure determination, we developed a novel processing pipeline by integrating four different software packages into a single platform (Fig. S3) (23DiIorio C. Kulczyk A.W. A robust single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) processing workflow with cryoSPARC, RELION and scipion.J. Vis. Exp. 2022; 179https://doi.org/10.3791/63387.PMID:35104261Google Scholar). Details of the single particle analysis workflow are presented in Fig. S4. Representative micrographs and 2D class averages are shown in Figs. S4 and S5A, respectively. The angular distribution heatmap obtained for the initial model calculated in cryoSPARC v3 (Structural Biotechnology Inc.) confirms the complete coverage of the angular space (Fig. S5B). To ensure the resolution estimates are not affected by masking, the mask applied during refinements was not too tight, and it encompassed all parts of the map (Fig. S5C). The structure of the Stx2a–P-stalk complex shown in Figure 3A was refined to 4.1 Å resolution according to the 0.143 threshold from the Fourier shell correlation plot (Fig. S6A). The local resolution values range from 3.5 to 7.5 Å. A histogram showing a distribution of local resolutions along with the local resolution values mapped onto the surface of Stx2a–P-stalk are presented in Fig. S6, B and C, respectively. The molecular model of Stx2a–P-stalk, which was derived from the cryo-EM map using atomic coordinates of Stx2a (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 6X6H) as a starting model, displays good validation statistics summarized in Fig. S7 and Table S1. The cryo-EM map presented in Figure 3A reveals densities representing a monomeric Stx2A subunit bound to a pentameric Stx2B subunit. Figure 3B displays atomic coordinates of Stx2a–P-stalk with the map colored according to the individual protein chains. Stx2A, denoted as chain A (Fig. 3C), is composed of two fragments, namely a catalytic Stx2A1 fragment consisting of the N-glycosidase active site and the P-stalk CTD-binding site (Fig. 3A), and Stx2A2 composed of an α-helix, which inserts into the channel formed by a pentameric ring of Stx2B (Fig. S8D). Stx2B is composed of five chains denoted as chains B, C, D, E, and F (Figs. 3B and S8, B–D). The structure reveals the presence of a density associated with Stx2a in the region identified earlier as the binding site for the CTD (Figs. 3C and S8A). This density can be fitted with the C-terminal six amino acids from a single P-protein of the P-stalk, denoted as chain P (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, the density corresponding to a flexible loop connecting StxA1 and StxA2 is visible in the cryo-EM structure (Figs. 3C and 4B). The cryo-EM structure of Stx2a holotoxin shows an overall good agreement with previously determined X-ray structures of Stx2a (PDB ID: 1R4P, (26Fraser M.E. Fujinaga M. Cherney M.M. Melton-Celsa A.R. Twiddy E.M. O'Brien A.D. et al.Structure of shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2) from Escherichia coli O157:H7.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27511-27517Google Scholar)) and Stx2a–P11 (PDB ID: 6X6H (20Rudolph M.J. Davis S.A. Tumer N.E. Li X.P. Structural basis for the interaction of Shiga toxin 2a with a C-terminal peptide of ribosomal P stalk proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 15588-15596Google Scholar)) (Fig. S9). However, unlike crystal structures, the cryo-EM data reveal an extensive dynamic behavior of Stx2a–P-stalk, including conformational changes in the P-stalk–binding site upon complex formation (Movie S1). The loop connecting Stx2A1 and Stx2A2 consists of the furin cleavage site at Arg250 (Fig. 4A). This loop has not been visualized in any of the crystal structures of Stx2a and Stx2a–P11 (20Rudolph M.J. Davis S.A. Tumer N.E. Li X.P. Structural basis for the interaction of Shiga toxin 2a with a C-terminal peptide of ribosomal P stalk proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 15588-15596Google Scholar). The cryo-EM structure reveals a part of this loop spanning residues Cys241–His243 and Ser256–Cys260 (Fig. 4). The structure shows that Tyr77, located in the N-glycosidase active site, is occluded by Stx2A2 (Fig. 4B). Thus, the proteolytic cleavage at Arg250 is responsible for activation of Stx2A1 by removing the steric hindrance imposed by Stx2A2 binding. In addition, the structure shows that the loop is stabilized by the disulfide bond involving residues Cys241 and Cys260 (Fig. 4). This disulfide bond is reduced in the ER, triggering the release of Stx2A1 from Stx2a. The binding interface between Stx2a and the CTD of the ribosomal P-stalk is displayed in Figure 5A. The CTD-binding pocket is located on the opposite side of the Stx2a surface than the active site, and it is formed by α-helices: A, F, I, and loop 1 spanning residues Pro27–Ser39 (Fig. 5B). The buried surface area includes 797 A2 of the CTD (chain P) and 17,010 A2 of Stx2A1 (chain A) (Fig. 5B). The binding interface involves Stx2a residues previously implicated in the P11 binding by the X-ray structure (20Rudolph M.J. Davis S.A. Tumer N.E. Li X.P. Structural basis for the interaction of Shiga toxin 2a with a C-terminal peptide of ribosomal P stalk proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 15588-15596Google Scholar) and mutational analysis (27Mastronarde D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements.J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152: 36-51Google Scholar), such as Asn18, Thr35, Thr36, Ser229, Leu232, and the conserved Arg172, Arg176, and Arg179 (Fig. 5A). Importantly, the cryo-EM structure reveals novel previously unidentified amino acids, involved in binding to the CTD, namely Gln10, Gln11, and Val14 (Fig. 5A). The cryo-EM structure unveils that the six amino-acid peptide (GFGLFD) from the CTD interacts with Stx2a. Because local resolutions are in the range of 4.5 to 6.5 Å (Fig. S6C), a full atomic model of the hexapeptide cannot be derived from the cryo-EM map directly. However, the density representing the peptide overlaps with atomic coordinates of all six amino acids from P11 visualized by the crystal structure of Stx2a–P11 (20Rudolph M.J. Davis S.A. Tumer N.E. Li X.P. Structural basis for the interaction of Shiga toxin 2a with a C-terminal peptide of ribosomal P stalk proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 15588-15596Google Scholar) (Fig. 5B), with the backbone deviation ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 Å. The hydrogen bonding pattern involving Gln175 and Asp11, and Arg176 and Phe10 from Stx2a and the CTD, respectively, is satisfied in both the X-ray and the cryo-EM structures. In contrast to the X-ray structure, Val14 forms nonpolar interactions with the first N-terminal Phe7 from the CTD (Fig. 5A). The density representing the CTD in the cryo-EM structure can also be fitted with the six amino-acid peptide adopting an α-helical, rather than a random-coil conformation, as observed in the X-ray structure (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, fitting the density with a short α-helix satisfies the hydrogen bonding pattern described previously. The observation that the CTD might behave as a random coil or as an α-helix is of significance, and it indicates the possibility for structural rearrangements in this region, as indicated previously (28Horbowicz-Drożdżal P. Kamel K. Kmiecik S. Borkiewicz L. Tumer N.E. Shaw P.C. et al.Phosphorylation of the conserved C-terminal domain of ribosomal P-proteins impairs the mode of interaction with plant toxins.FEBS Lett. 2021; 595: 2221-2236Google Scholar). To access whether the binding of Stx2a to the entire ribosome, including the P-stalk, would stabilize the CTD–Stx2a interaction such that a fragment of the P-stalk reaching beyond the C-terminal six amino acids can be imaged, we attempted to determine a structure of Stx2a complexed with the 3 MDa S. cerevisiae ribosome and to visualize details of the CTD–Stx2a interface by focused refinements. We solved a cryo-EM structure of the 80S ribosome (Fig. S10), but we were not able to visualize Stx2a binding because of the intrinsic flexibility of the P-stalk (Fig. S10B). The ribosomal P-stalk is a dynamic structural feature of the ribosome, which facilitates interactions of the ribosome with trGTPases and RIPs (29Grela P. Szajwaj M. Horbowicz-Drożdżal P. Tchórzewski M. How ricin damages the ribosome.Toxins (Basel). 2019; 11: 241-257Google Scholar). A part of the P-stalk, namely the CTD, can be regarded as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). In support of this notion, the NMR analysis demonstrated that the CTDs of P-proteins are disordered in solution (30Lee K.M. Yusa K. Chu L.O. Yu C.W. Oono M. Miyoshi T. et al.Solution structure of human P1•P2 heterodimer provides insights into the role of eukaryotic stalk in recruiting the ribosome-inactivating protein trichosanthin to the ribosome.Nucl. Acids Res. 2013; 41: 8776-8787Google Scholar, 31Grela P. Helgstrand M. Krokowski D. Boguszewska A. Svergun D. Liljas A. et al.Structural characterization of the ribosomal P1A-P2B protein dimer by small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR spectroscopy.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1988-1998Google Scholar). Consequently, the conformational rearrangements occurring upon binding of an RIP to the P-stalk pose a considerable challenge for structural analysis. We have thus employed AlphaFold2 (Deep Mind) for structure prediction of the P-stalk including a truncated uL10 analogous to the one used for cryo-EM studies, which contained an intact P-domain, along with P1A, P1B, P2A, and P2B subunits (Figs. 6A and S11). The predicted structure of a fully assembled P-stalk reveals a cuboid shape with a diameter of approximately 70 Å × 40 Å × 40 Å corresponding to the folded NTDs of the P-stalk on one end and an extended unstructured region representing the CTDs on the other end (Figs. 6A and S11A). The structural core of the P-stalk is formed by the four α-helices from uL10 (P0), which provide an extended scaffold for binding by the 4-helix bundles from NTDs of each individual P-protein subunit (P1A, P1B, P2A, and P2B). A modeled structure of the P-stalk is in good agreement with the NMR structure of the individual P1–P2 dimer (PDB ID: 4BEH) (30Lee K.M. Yusa K. Chu L.O. Yu C.W. Oono M. Miyoshi T. et al.Solution structure of human P1•P2 heterodimer provides insights into the role of eukaryotic stalk in recruiting the ribosome-inactivating protein trichosanthin to the ribosome.Nucl. Acids Res. 2013; 41: 8776-8787Google Scholar) and also with the P-stalk fragment revealed by the structure of the ribosome (PDB ID: 4V6X) (14Anger A.M. Armache J.P. Berninghausen O. Habeck M. Subklewe M. Wilson D.N. et al.Structures of the human and Drosophila 80S ribosome.Nature. 2013; 497: 80-85Google Scholar). The backbone RMSDs calculated for the NMR structure and the AlphaFold2 model are 1.2 and 0.9 Å in the NTDs of P1 and P2 subunits, respectively (Fig. S12). The CTDs of P1 and P2 are extended approximately ∼125 Å away from the NTDs in the NMR structure, and they are unfolded in solution (Fig. S12).The model reveals that the C-terminal six amino-acid peptides from the CTDs (sequence GFGLFD), which are implicated in binding to Stx2a by the cryo-EM structure, remain unstructured in the absence of the toxin (Figs. 6A and S11A). To assess the propensity for the secondary structure formation in these regions, we carried out the disorder probability analysis presented in Figure 6B. The analysis revealed that, in contrast to the reminder of the CTD, the six amino-acid sequences from the C terminus of each P-protein have a predisposition for secondary structure formation. This result is consistent with the results of the CTD docking into the cryo-EM map (Fig. 5B). The cryo-EM structure of Stx2a–P-stalk and structural modeling of the ribosomal P-stalk pentamer indicated the propensity for conformational rearrangements in the CTD upon complex formation. We have therefore performed the principal component analysis (PCA) of the cryo-EM data to directly assess the mode of the Stx2a–P-stalk interaction (Figs. 7 and S13). The initial set of 1,401,983 particle images, obtained after 2D classification and averaging, was used for the PCA (Fig. S4). This stack of particles was not subjected to the 3D classification or 3D refinements. The PCA reveals an intrinsic dynamics of the complex, the fact supported by an extensive variability in the three calculated eigenvectors (Fig. S13A), and by a nonuniform appearance of the reaction coordinate plots (Fig. S13B). The continuous distributions of reaction coordinates on these plots are indicative of the continuous motion in Stx2a–P-stalk, rather than the presence of discrete conformations. The intrinsic dynamics of the Stx2a–P-stalk complex, characterized by the first eigenvector, is summarized in Figure 7A and visualized in Movie S1. Stx2A1 displays molecular flexing, the motion accompanied by the rotation-like movement of the individual Stx2B subunits and a corkscrew-like motion of Stx2A2 (Fig. 7A). The flexing of Stx2A1 affects the conformation of the P-stalk–binding pocket. Structural changes occurring upon the P-stalk binding are summarized in Figure 7B. The inward rotation of loop 1 (Pro27–Ser39) toward the CTD brings residues Thr35 and Thr36 into the binding pocket and indirectly influences the position of the α-helix I harboring active-site residues Ser229 and Leu232. The mobility of loop 2 spanning amino acids Ile54–Leu67, which rotates outward from the CTD-binding site, indirectly affects the position of the α-helix A containing the CTD-binding residues Gln10, Gln11, and Val14. The movement and outward rotation in loop 3 (residues L"

Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) exerts a vital function in drug resistance of many tumors. Nevertheless, the potential molecular mechanism of Nrf2 regulating the base excision repair pathway that mediates AML chemotherapy resistance remains unclear. Here, in clinical samples, we found that the high expression of Nrf2 and base excision repair pathway gene encoding 8-hydroxyguanine DNA glycosidase (OGG1) was associated with AML disease progression. In vitro, Nrf2 and OGG1 were highly expressed in drug-resistant leukemia cells. Upregulation of Nrf2 in leukemia cells by lentivirus transfection could decrease the sensitivity of leukemia cells to cytarabine, whereas downregulation of Nrf2 in drug-resistant cells could enhance leukemia cell chemosensitivity. Meanwhile, we found that Nrf2 could positively regulate OGG1 expression in leukemia cells. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that Nrf2 could bind to the promoter of OGG1. Furthermore, the use of OGG1 inhibitor TH5487 could partially reverse the inhibitory effect of upregulated Nrf2 on leukemia cell apoptosis. In vivo, downregulation of Nrf2 could increase the sensitivity of leukemia cell to cytarabine and decrease OGG1 expression. Mechanistically, Nrf2-OGG1 axis-mediated AML resistance might be achieved by activating the AKT signaling pathway to regulate downstream apoptotic proteins. Thus, this study reveals a novel mechanism of Nrf2-promoting drug resistance in leukemia, which may provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of drug-resistant/refractory leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W4311912039,"Older adult populations are at risk for zinc deficiency, which may predispose them to immune dysfunction and age-related chronic inflammation that drives myriad diseases and disorders. Recent work also implicates the gut microbiome in the onset and severity of age-related inflammation, indicating that dietary zinc status and the gut microbiome may interact to impact age-related host immunity. We hypothesize that age-related alterations in the gut microbiome contribute to the demonstrated zinc deficits in host zinc levels and increased inflammation. We tested this hypothesis with a multifactor two-part study design in a C57BL/6 mouse model. The two studies included young (2 month old) and aged (24 month old) mice fed either (1) a zinc adequate or zinc supplemented diet, or (2) a zinc adequate or marginal zinc deficient diet, respectively. Overall microbiome composition did not significantly change with zinc status; beta diversity was driven almost exclusively by age effects. Microbiome differences due to age are evident at all taxonomic levels, with more than half of all taxonomic units significantly different. Furthermore, we found 150 out of 186 genera were significantly different between the two age groups, with Bacteriodes and Parabacteroides being the primary taxa of young and old mice, respectively. These data suggest that modulating individual micronutrient concentrations does not lead to comprehensive microbiome shifts, but rather affects specific components of the gut microbiome. However, a phylogenetic agglomeration technique (ClaaTU) revealed phylogenetic clades that respond to modulation of dietary zinc status and inflammation state in an age-dependent manner. Collectively, these results suggest that a complex interplay exists between host age, gut microbiome composition, and dietary zinc status."
https://openalex.org/W4311488874,"Phosphorylation of Inhibitor of κB (IκB) proteins by IκB Kinase β (IKKβ) leads to IκB degradation and subsequent activation of nuclear factor κB transcription factors. Of particular interest is the IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of IκBα residues Ser32 and Ser36 within a conserved destruction box motif. To investigate the catalytic mechanism of IKKβ, we performed pre–steady-state kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation of IκBα protein substrates catalyzed by constitutively active, human IKKβ. Phosphorylation of full-length IκBα catalyzed by IKKβ was characterized by a fast exponential phase followed by a slower linear phase. The maximum observed rate (kp) of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of IκBα was 0.32 s−1 and the binding affinity of ATP for the IKKβ•IκBα complex (Kd) was 12 μM. Substitution of either Ser32 or Ser36 with Ala, Asp, or Cys reduced the amplitude of the exponential phase by approximately 2-fold. Thus, the exponential phase was attributed to phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36, whereas the slower linear phase was attributed to phosphorylation of other residues. Interestingly, the exponential rate of phosphorylation of the IκBα(S32D) phosphomimetic amino acid substitution mutant was nearly twice that of WT IκBα and 4-fold faster than any of the other IκBα amino acid substitution mutants, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser32 increases the phosphorylation rate of Ser36. These conclusions were supported by parallel experiments using GST-IκBα(1–54) fusion protein substrates bearing the first 54 residues of IκBα. Our data suggest a model wherein, IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα at Ser32 followed by Ser36 within a single binding event.

The nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)2 family of transcription factors are evolutionarily conserved master regulators of cell proliferation, innate immunity, inflammation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (1Hayden M.S.

Regulation and function of NF-kappaB transcription factors in the immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of NF-κB is associated with many disorders, including cancer, autoimmune disease, neurodegenerative diseases, arthritis, and diabetes (3Karin M. Nuclear factor-kappaB in cancer development and progression.Nature. 2006; 441: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (3042) Google Scholar, 4Courtois G. Gilmore T.D.

NF-kappaB, inflammation, and metabolic disease.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Thus, investigation of the molecular mechanisms of NF-κB activation is important for our understanding of human disease. The mammalian NF-κB family consists of RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105 (NF-κB1), and p52/p100 (NF-κB2), which form 15 separate homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes (6Oeckinghaus A. Ghosh S. The NF-kappaB family of transcription factors and its regulation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2009; 1: a000034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB dimers containing RelA, RelB, and/or c-Rel are sequestered in the cytoplasm through interactions with Inhibitor of κB (IκB) proteins IκBα, IκBβ, or IκBε. In contrast, NF-κB dimers containing p100 and p105 are localized to the cytoplasm through a C-terminal inhibitory domain containing multiple ankyrin repeat motifs. In response to various stimuli, NF-kB is activated through one of two separate pathways: the canonical or the noncanonical pathway. Within the canonical pathway, a Ser/Thr-specific IκB kinase (IKK) complex phosphorylates IκB proteins within a conserved DSGXXS destruction box motif, leading to IκB polyubiquitination, 26S proteasome-mediated degradation, and subsequent NF-κB release. Free NF-κB dimers then translocate to the nucleus to regulate transcription. In the noncanonical pathway, the IKK complex phosphorylates p100 to induce proteolytic processing of p100 to the activated NF-κB2 subunit p52, which also localizes to the nucleus. The IKK complex also catalyzes the phosphorylation of several protein substrates within alternative signaling pathways, and this activity is thought to coordinate the functions of the NF-κB pathways with other cellular pathways (reviewed in reference (7Hinz M. Scheidereit C. The IkappaB kinase complex in NF-kappaB regulation and beyond.EMBO Rep. 2014; 15: 46-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar)). The IKK complex consists of the nonenzymatic protein NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator, also called IKKγ) and a homodimer or heterodimer of the catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ (8Chen Z.J. Parent L.

Although the phosphorylation of IκB proteins by IKKβ is a critical step within the canonical pathway of NF-κB activation, the molecular mechanism of IKKβ is poorly understood. Here, we used pre–steady-state kinetic analysis to investigate the molecular mechanism of IκBα phosphorylation catalyzed by constitutively active IKKβ. Our data indicate that IKKβ phosphorylates full-length IκBα twice within the conserved DSGXXS destruction box motif (Fig. 1C) during a single binding event. Our study also suggests that IKKβ preferentially phosphorylates IκBα sequentially at Ser32, followed by Ser36. We conclude that these aspects of the kinetic mechanism of IKKβ may be shared among the IKK and IKK-related kinases. The activity of human IKKβ (Fig. 1A) is significantly increased upon phosphorylation of activation loop residues Ser177 and Ser181 within the kinase domain (21Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L.

In order to measure the catalytic rates of activated IKKβ, we chose to utilize a constitutively active IKKβ (S177E, S181E) phosphomimetic amino acid substitution mutation (12Mercurio F. Murray B.W.

Within the canonical pathway of NF-κB activation, IKKβ specifically phosphorylates IκBα at residues Ser32 and Ser36 (Fig. 1, B and C) to induce the proteolytic degradation of IκBα and the subsequent release of NF-κB dimers. Importantly, IκBα is also phosphorylated at other sites in vivo, particularly within the C-terminal PEST domain (Fig. 1B) (23Barroga C.F. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Verma I.M.

Meloche S. Hiscott J. Phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha in the C-terminal PEST domain by casein kinase II affects intrinsic protein stability.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike phosphorylation of residues within the destruction box motif, phosphorylation of residues within the PEST domain does not specifically target IκBα for ubiquitination and 26S proteasome-mediated degradation (24Lin R. Beauparlant P. Makris C. Meloche S. Hiscott J. Phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha in the C-terminal PEST domain by casein kinase II affects intrinsic protein stability.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1401-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic analysis has demonstrated that IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα by using a random sequential mechanism (25Peet G.W. Li J. IkappaB kinases alpha and beta show a random sequential kinetic mechanism and are inhibited by staurosporine and quercetin.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32655-32661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), indicating that IKKβ can bind IκBα and ATP in any order prior to catalysis. However, because IKKβ exhibits autophosphorylation (Fig. 2), we chose to measure the pre–steady-state kinetic parameters of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of IκBα by first incubating IKKβ with the IκBα protein substrate to generate the IKKβ•IκBα complex and subsequently initiating the reaction by the rapid addition of ATP. To initially characterize the molecular mechanism of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of full-length IκBα, the ground-state–binding affinity of ATP (Kd) for the IKKβ•IκBα complex and the maximum observed rate (kp) of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation were determined by using pre–steady-state kinetic analysis. To this end, we measured the ATP concentration dependence of the phosphorylation rate of IKKβ under conditions where IKKβ was in a 4-fold molar excess compared to the IκBα substrate to ensure that nearly all of the IκBα substrate was initially bound by the kinase. IKKβ has previously been shown to bind IκBα with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 56 nM (26Heilker R. Freuler F. Vanek M. Pulfer R. Kobel T. Peter J. et al.The kinetics of association and phosphorylation of IkappaB isoforms by IkappaB kinase 2 correlate with their cellular regulation in human endothelial cells.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6231-6238Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and thus, we calculated that >98% of the IκBα substrate was initially bound by IKKβ under our experimental conditions. A preincubated solution of full-length IκBα and IKKβ (S177E, S181E) was rapidly mixed with a solution containing increasing concentrations of [γ-32P]ATP for various times. The reaction products were then separated by SDS-PAGE and phosphorylation of IκBα was quantified by using autoradiography (Fig. 2). A [γ-32P]-labeled, linearized DNA vector was included as a loading control because it was easily separated from both IKKβ and IκBα by SDS-PAGE, and it provided a consistent signal after incubation with IKKβ, IκBα, and ATP (Fig. 2). The amount of phosphorylated IκBα detected at each time point was normalized to the loading control and plotted as a function of reaction time (Fig. 3A). The resulting plots indicated that IKKβ (S177E, S181E) phosphorylated IκBα with an initial, fast exponential phase rate (ke), followed by a significantly slower linear phase rate (kl) and therefore, these data were fit to biphasic Equation 1 (see Experimental procedures). The biphasic nature of the plot can be clearly observed in Figure 4A when longer reaction time points were included in the plot. We hypothesized that the initial exponential rate corresponded to phosphorylation of IκBα at residues Ser32 and Ser36 within the destruction box motif, and the significantly slower linear rate resulted from either the phosphorylation of IκBα at sites outside of the destruction box motif, such as the PEST domain (Fig. 1B), or phosphorylation of IκBα substrate that was not initially bound in a productive complex by IKKβ, or both. The exponential rates of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of IκBα were then plotted as a function of ATP concentration and fit to hyperbolic Equation 2 (Fig. 3B), yielding a kp of 0.32 ± 0.01 s−1 for the maximum observed rate of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of full-length IκBα and a Kd of 12 ± 1 μM for ATP binding to the IKKβ•IκBα complex.Figure 4IKKβ phosphorylation of full-length IκBα and full-length IκBα amino acid substitution mutants. A preincubated solution of IKKβ (3 μM) and the indicated full-length IκBα (0.75 μM) was rapidly mixed with a solution containing a [γ-32P]-labeled loading control and [γ-32P]ATP (500 μM) for various times. Phosphorylation of the full-length IκBα substrates was then normalized to the loading control and plotted as arbitrary phosphorylation units (a.u.) as a function of time from (A) 0 to 500 s or (B) 0 to 50 s. The solid lines represent the best fits to biphasic Equation 1 (see Experimental procedures).

To this end, we evaluated the phosphorylation of seven separate full-length IκBα amino acid substitution mutants (Fig. 1C) in which either residue Ser32 or Ser36 were individually changed to (i) Ala to eliminate the phosphorylation site, (ii) Asp to mimic the size and charge of a phosphorylated Ser, or iii) Cys to mimic the size and hydrophilic character of Ser while eliminating the phosphorylation site. An IκBα(S32A, S36A) double alanine substitution mutant was also tested in which both Ser residues within the destruction box motif were eliminated. The amount of phosphorylated IκBα product was plotted as a function of reaction time and fit to biphasic Equation 1 (Fig. 4). Kinetic data derived from the best fit curves are reported in Figure 4, C–E and Table 1.Table 1Kinetic parametersaPhosphorylation of the full-length IκBα substrates by IKKβ (S177E, S181E) were fit to Equation 1, [Product] = A[1 – exp(-ket)] + klt where A is the exponential phase amplitude, ke is the exponential rate and kl is the linear rate (see Experimental procedures). of full-length IκBα phosphorylation by IKKβFull-length IκBα substrateCognate phosphorylation sitesExponential phase amplitude (%)Exponential rate (s-1)Linear rate (s-1)WTS32, S3665 ± 30.28 ± 0.040.0011 ± 0.0002S32AS3627 ± 20.13 ± 0.020.0011 ± 0.0002S32DS3629 ± 10.50 ± 0.090.0012 ± 0.0002S32CS3636 ± 30.18 ± 0.040.0013 ± 0.0003S36AS3224 ± 10.17 ± 0.030.0018 ± 0.0003S36DS3234 ± 30.15 ± 0.050.0012 ± 0.0004S36CS3221 ± 10.17 ± 0.030.0017 ± 0.0003S32A, S36Anone3.8 ± 0.60.048 ± 0.0170.004 ± 0.001a Phosphorylation of the full-length IκBα substrates by IKKβ (S177E, S181E) were fit to Equation 1, [Product] = A[1 – exp(-ket)] + klt where A is the exponential phase amplitude, ke is the exponential rate and kl is the linear rate (see Experimental procedures). Open table in a new tab Comparing the kinetic parameters of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of wt IκBα and the IκBα amino acid substitution mutants, the amplitude of the exponential phase produced by phosphorylation of each of the IκBα single amino acid substitution mutants was reduced approximately 2-fold when compared to the exponential phase amplitude of wt IκBα (Fig. 4C and Table 1). Additionally, the observed exponential phase amplitude produced by phosphorylation of the IκBα(S32A, S36A) double amino acid substitution mutant was reduced by 17-fold when compared to wt IκBα (Fig. 4C and Table 1). These data indicate that the exponential phase of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of IκBα corresponds to phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36. Interestingly, the exponential phase of wt IκBα phosphorylation can be fit to a single rate (Fig. 4), indicating that IKKβ phosphorylated IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36 rapidly, without a significant intervening step. This finding strongly suggests that IKKβ phosphorylated wt IκBα twice, without complete disassociation and reassociation of the IKKβ•IκBα complex. Thus, we concluded that IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα processively within a single binding event. Interestingly, the exponential rate of phosphorylation of the IκBα(S32D) phosphomimetic substitution mutant was increased by approximately 1.8 fold when compared to the exponential rate of phosphorylation of wt IκBα (Fig. 4D and Table 1). In contrast, the exponential rate of phosphorylation for all of the other IκBα single amino acid substitution mutants, including the IκBα(S36D) phosphomimetic amino acid substitution mutant, was reduced by approximately 1.5-fold when compared to wt IκBα phosphorylation (Fig. 4D and Table 1). These data suggest that if IκBα is phosphorylated at Ser32, the rate at which IKKβ catalyzes the second phosphorylation event at Ser36 is increased, while phosphorylation of IκBα Ser36 does not increase the rate of phosphorylation at Ser32. The linear rate of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of the IκBα single amino acid substitution mutants was virtually identical (within 2-fold) to the linear rate of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of wt IκBα (Fig. 4E and Table 1). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the linear phase of phosphorylation of IκBα and the IκBα amino acid substitution mutants results primarily from phosphorylation of IκBα at sites outside of the destruction box motif (Fig. 1, B and C) by IKKβ. Interestingly, the linear rate of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of the IκBα(S32A, S36A) double amino acid substitution mutant was 2- to 4-fold faster than for wt IκBα and the IκBα single amino acid substitution mutants (Fig. 4E and Table 1), suggesting that IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ser32 and Ser36 may have slowed the linear PEST domain phosphorylation rate in these experiments. Although IKKβ preferentially phosphorylates IκBα within the destruction box motif (Fig. 1, B and C), we predicted that IKKβ is also capable of phosphorylating IκBα at sites within the C-terminal region (residues 55–317), such as within the PEST domain (Fig. 1B). To rule out the possibility that the observed rates of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of full-length IκBα were significantly influenced by phosphorylation of IκBα residues outside of the destruction box motif, we evaluated the phosphorylation of glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-IκBα(1–54) fusion proteins (Fig. 1, B and C). These GST-IκBα(1–54) protein substrates lack the C-terminal region of IκBα. Thus, we predicted that nonspecific substrate phosphorylation by IKKβ would be reduced when testing these protein substrates. We assessed the IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of GST-IκBα(1–54) bearing the first 54 residues of IκBα, including the destruction box motif, and seven separate amino acid substitution mutations of GST-IκBα(1–54) (Fig. 1, B and C) under pre–steady-state conditions. The amount of phosphorylated IκBα substrate detected was plotted as a function of reaction time (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast to phosphorylation of the full-length IκBα substrates (Fig. 4, A and B), only a single exponential phase of GST-IκBα(1–54) was observed (Fig. 5, A and B). Therefore, these data were fit to single-exponential Equation 3 (see Experimental procedures). Kinetic data derived from the best fit curves are reported in Figure 5, C and D as well as Table 2. The absence of a clear linear phase was likely due to either a reduction in nonspecific phosphorylation of the GST-IκBα(1–54) fusion protein at sites outside of the destruction box motif when compared to phosphorylation of the full-length IκBα substrates and/or a reduction in the number of initial, unproductive protein complexes. Consistently, the rate of GST-IκBα(1–54)(S32A, S36A) phosphorylation was too slow to be accurately measured (Fig. 5, A and B).Table 2Kinetic parameters of GST-IκBα(1–54)aPhosphorylation of the GST- IκBα(1–54) substrates by IKKβ (S177E, S181E) were fit to Equation 3, [Product] = A[1 – exp(-ket)] where A is the exponential phase amplitude and ke is the exponential rate (see Experimental procedures). phosphorylation by IKKβGST-IκBα(1–54) substrateCognate phosphorylation sitesExponential phase amplitude (%)Exponential rate (s-1)WTS32, S3696 ± 30.29 ± 0.03S32AS3642 ± 30.18 ± 0.04S32DS3659 ± 20.28 ± 0.04S32CS3653 ± 20.20 ± 0.03S36AS3244 ± 20.21 ± 0.03S36DS3248 ± 30.20 ± 0.05S36CS3249 ± 20.18 ± 0.03S32A, S36AbA dash (-) indicates that phosphorylation of GST-IκBα(1–54)(S32A, S36A) by IKKβ was too low to be accurately quantified.none––a Phosphorylation of the GST- IκBα(1–54) substrates by IKKβ (S177E, S181E) were fit to Equation 3, [Product] = A[1 – exp(-ket)] where A is the exponential phase amplitude and ke is the exponential rate (see Experimental procedures).b A dash (-) indicates that phosphorylation of GST-IκBα(1–54)(S32A, S36A) by IKKβ was too low to be accurately quantified. Open table in a new tab It has been previously demonstrated that the C-terminal region (residues 55–317) of IκBα (Fig. 1B) interacts with the ULD and SSD of IKKβ (Fig. 1A) (19Xu G. Lo Y.C. Li Q. Napolitano G. Wu X. Jiang X. et al.Crystal structure of inhibitor of kappaB kinase beta.Nature. 2011; 472: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Such interaction may help to properly position the N-terminal destruction box motif of IκBα for phosphorylation by the KD of IKKβ (Fig. 6) and thus, influence the molecular mechanism of IKKβ. Interestingly, in agreement with our observations of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation of the full-length IκBα substrates, the amplitude of the exponential phase of GST-IκBα(1–54) wt phosphorylation was approximately 2-fold greater than the exponential phase amplitude of all six of the GST-IκBα(1–54) single amino acid substitution mutants (Fig. 5C and Table 2). Thus, we concluded that interactions between IKKβ and the C-terminal region of IκBα are not required for IKKβ to phosphorylate IκBα twice within a single binding event. Furthermore, the full-length IκBα and the GST-IκBα(1–54) wt substrates were both phosphorylated at similar exponential rates (Figs. 4D and 5D, Tables 1 and 2), suggesting that interactions between IKKβ and the C-terminal domain of IκBα do not significantly alter the overall exponential rate of IKKβ-catalyzed phosphorylation. However, in contrast to the results obtained with the full-length IκBα amino acid substitution mutants (Fig. 4D and Table 1), the GST-IκBα(1–54)(S32D) phosphomimetic amino acid substitution mutant was phosphorylated at a similar rate to the GST-IκBα(1–54) wt substrate, and the remaining GST-IκBα(1–54) single amino acid substitution mutants were phosphorylated at a rate that was only reduced by approximately 1.5-fold when compared to GST-IκBα(1–54) wt (Fig. 5D and Table 2). Thus, substitution of destruction box residues Ser32 or Ser36 of the GST-IκBα(1–54) substrates altered the exponential rate of phosphorylation of these truncated substrates to a lesser extent than substitution of Ser32 or Ser36 within the full-length IκBα substrates. We concluded that although interactions between IKKβ a"

CCN2 has previously been reported to be secreted as a preproprotein that requires proteolytic activation to release its bioactive carboxyl-terminal fragment. Here, our goal was to resolve whether CCN5, a divergent member of the CCN family with converse functions relative to CCN2, releases the TSP1 homology domain as its bioactive signaling entity. The recombinant CCN5 or CCN3 TSP1 homology domains were produced in ExpiCHO-S or DG44 CHO cells as secretory fusion proteins appended to the carboxyl-terminal end of His-Halo-Sumo or amino-terminal end of human albumin and purified from the cell culture medium. We tested these fusion proteins in various phosphokinase signaling pathways or cell physiologic assays. Fusion proteins with the CCN5 TSP1 domain inhibited key signaling pathways previously reported to be stimulated by CCN2, irrespective of fusion partner. The fusion proteins also efficiently inhibited CCN1/2-stimulated cell migration and gap closure following scratch wound of fibroblasts. Fusion protein with the CCN3 TSP1 domain inhibited these functions with similar efficacy and potency as that of the CCN5 TSP1 domain. The CCN5 TSP1 domain also recapitulated a positive regulatory function previously assigned to full-length CCN5, that is, induction of estrogen receptor-α mRNA expression in triple negative MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells and inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and CCN2-induced mammosphere formation of MCF-7 adenocarcinoma cells. In conclusion, the CCN5 TSP1 domain is the bioactive entity that confers the biologic functions of unprocessed CCN5."

In this study, we evaluated the combined effect of CAP and nZVI on the metabolic activity of the surviving cells and induction of apoptosis in malignant melanoma in comparison with normal cells. Therefore, the effect of various time exposure of CAP radiation, different doses of nZVI, and the combined effect of CAP and nZVI were evaluated on the viability of malignant melanoma cells (B16-F10) and normal fibroblast cells (L929) at 24 h after treatment using MTT assay. Then, the effect of appropriate doses of each treatment on apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry with Annexin/PI staining. In addition, the expression of BAX, BCL2 and Caspase 3 (CASP3) was also assayed. The results showed although the combined effect of CAP and nZVI significantly showed cytotoxic effects and apoptotic activity on cancer cells, this treatment had no more effective compared to CAP or nZVI alone. In addition, evaluation of gene expression showed that combination therapy didn’t improve expression of apoptotic genes in comparison with CAP or nZVI. In conclusion, combined treatment of CAP and nZVI does not seem to be able to improve the effect of monotherapy of CAP or nZVI. It may be due to the resistance of cancer cells to high ROS uptake or the accumulation of saturated ROS in cells, which prevents the intensification of apoptosis."

If survivors are subsequently blamed for the events, both consequences worsen. Stigma flourishes, especially when survivors are silenced so that details of the trauma remain unknown. Breaking the secrecy both at the individual and collective level is key to enable the healing and reconciliation of individuals and communities living under continuous threat.The NETfacts health system is a stepped care model with three components: (1) Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET), an evidence-based trauma therapy that includes survivor testimony (2) NET for Forensic Offender Rehabilitation (FORNET) acknowledges that perpetrators are frequently also victims and assists in reducing aggression and the attraction to violence, and (3) a community intervention disseminating and discussing Facts derived from NET treatment (NETfacts) to challenge the collective avoidance of atrocities and other traumatic material. The intervention was piloted in a community with 497 adult residents in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The willingness of clients to consent to sharing their anonymised testimonies (with a focus on sexual violence survivors and ex-combatants) was investigated, together with other components of feasibility including security and clinical safety, extent of support of respected local authorities and participation rates. As secondary outcomes, clinical and social measures were assessed before and post NETfacts among 200 village residents of whom 160 self-enrolled and 40 had not participated in any form of treatment.Implementation was feasible with 248 clients from a partner project giving consent to use their testimonies and high support of respected local authorities and participation rates (56% of residents self-enrolled in NETfacts). Immediate beneficial effects were shown for posttraumatic stress and rejection of rape myths among NETfacts participants who experienced multiple traumatic events in their own past. Attitudes towards ex-combatants improved and the perceived lack of social acknowledgement after trauma increased independent from participation. No significant change was observed for depressive symptoms.NETfacts is a feasible and promising approach to challenge the culture of secrecy surrounding trauma, suppression and social exclusion.

CPD PLs repair mainly CPDs (Pyr<>Pyr), while (6–4) PLs repair Pyr-Pyr photoproducts (Pyr [6–4] Pyr) using blue light (350–500 nm) as the energy source (1Kavakli I.H. Baris I. Tardu M. Gul S. Oner H.

PLs are monomeric proteins with molecular masses of 50 to 61 kDa and possess two chromophores (12Sancar A. Structure and function of DNA photolyase and cryptochrome blue-light photoreceptors.Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is an essential cofactor for the catalytic activity of PLs and acts as a catalytic cofactor in all PLs (5Kavakli I.H. Ozturk N. Gul S. DNA repair by photolyases.Adv. Protein Chem. Struct. Biol. 2019; 115: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Sancar A. Structure and function of DNA photolyase and cryptochrome blue-light photoreceptors.Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). The second chromophore, which acts as a photoantenna, varies depending on the organism. The following photoantenna are being found: methenyltetrahydrofolate, 8-hydroxy-7,8-didemethyl-5-deazariboflavin, FAD, FMN, or 6,7-dimethyl 8-ribityl-lumazin (DMRL) depending on the type of PL (13Zhang F.

However, studies with different bacteria revealed the presence of (6–4) PLs (15Dikbas U.M. Tardu M. Canturk A. Gul S. Ozcelik G.

These bacterial (6–4) PLs are distinct in that they contain [4 Fe-4 S] as well as DMRL and FAD cofactors (15Dikbas U.M. Tardu M. Canturk A. Gul S. Ozcelik G.

Crystal structures of various PLs have been determined by X-ray crystallography. The first available crystal structure is Escherichia coli CPD PL (18Park H.W. Kim S.T. Sancar A. Deisenhofer J.

Subsequent structures have been obtained from different organismal PLs including Anacystis nidulans (19Tamada T. Kitadokoro K. Higuchi Y. Inaka K.

A. 2013; 110: 7217-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The comparison of the crystal structures of various homologous PLs revealed valuable information about their structural features and enzyme mechanisms. PLs are made up of two well-defined domains which are α/β and α-helical domains. The α-helical domain is associated with FAD, while α/β domain is the binding site for the second chromophore (12Sancar A. Structure and function of DNA photolyase and cryptochrome blue-light photoreceptors.Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). These two domains are connected by a long flexible loop. Vibrio cholerae O1 bivar Tor str. N16961 has a CPD PL that repairs T<>T dimers and two CRY-DASHs that repair T<>T dimers in ssDNA (11Selby C.P. Sancar A.

Our previous study with a gene (Vca0809) in V. cholerae highly expressed upon exposure of the organism to blue light (23Tardu M. Bulut S. Kavakli I.H. MerR and ChrR mediate blue light induced photo-oxidative stress response at the transcriptional level in Vibrio cholerae.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 40817Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our further characterization of this gene revealed that it encodes (6-4) PL with FAD and DMRL and consists of the [4Fe-4S] domain (15Dikbas U.M. Tardu M. Canturk A. Gul S. Ozcelik G. Baris I. et al.Identification and characterization of a new class of (6-4) photolyase from Vibrio cholerae.Biochemistry. 2019; 58: 4352-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here, we determined the crystal structure of Vc (6-4) PL to 2.5 Å resolution. Our crystal structure comparison revealed a putative DNA-binding region of Vc (6-4) PL. We recently identified a (6-4) PL from V. cholerae O1 bivar Tor str. N16961(Vc) which possesses the catalytic cofactor FAD, an antenna chromophore DMRL, and an additional cofactor [4Fe-4S] cluster (15Dikbas U.M. Tardu M. Canturk A. Gul S. Ozcelik G. Baris I. et al.Identification and characterization of a new class of (6-4) photolyase from Vibrio cholerae.Biochemistry. 2019; 58: 4352-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We determined the crystal structure of Vc (6-4) PL at 2.5 Å resolution at cryogenic temperature at the Turkish Light Source known as “Turkish DeLight” (24Atalay N. Akcan E.K. Gül M. Ayan E. Destan E. Ertem F.B. et al.Cryogenic X-ray crystallographic studies of biomacromolecules at Turkish light source “Turkish DeLight”.bioRxiv. 2022; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.03.506456Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 25Gul M.

The structure contains all the cofactors with well-defined electron densities and contains a total of 24 α helixes and five β sheets (Fig. 1A). It consists of two domains: an α-helical domain that is associated with FAD and α/β domain which interacts with DMRL cofactor. The sequence alignment of Vc (6-4) PL with A. tumefaciens (At) and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (Rs) (6-4) PLs showed that it has 38.4% and 43.1% sequence similarity, respectively (Fig. 1B). DMRL is a photoantenna chromophore that absorbs light more efficiently than FAD for increasing catalytic efficiency (13Zhang F. Scheerer P. Oberpichler I. Lamparter T. Krauss N. Crystal structure of a prokaryotic (6-4) photolyase with an Fe-S cluster and a 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine antenna chromophore.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110: 7217-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In our crystal structure, there is a very well-defined electron density of the DMRL and interacting amino acid residues (Fig. 2A). The aromatic ring of DMRL interacts with nitrogen atoms of Gln11, Leu35, Gln39, and oxygen atom of Ala33 (Fig. 2B). Additionally, the aromatic ring of DMRL interacts with Trp488, Ala33, and Ile9. The DMRL's ribityl group forms hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms of Glu38, Tyr41, Asp12, and Asp10's amino group. When we compare the interaction partners of DMRL in Vc (6-4) PL with other known bacterial (6-4) PLs, almost all the interactions are well conserved with a few exceptions. First, the Cys32 carboxyl group of At (6-4) PL interacts with the aromatic ring in DMRL (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 4DJA), while in both Vc and Rs (6-4) PLs, DMRL interacts with the main chain carbonyl group of Ala33. We identified a critical water molecule (W22) that interacts with Asp12, Gln13, Asp106, and DMRL in Vc (6-4) PL (Fig. 2C). Analyses of other bacterial (6-4) PLs have shown similar conserved motifs (Fig. 2C). Such motifs increase the overall stability of the DMRL within the enzyme. However, the W22 molecule interacts with Asp106 of the Vc (6-4) PL with a distance of 2.8 Å, while the same interaction occurs with Gly105 of other bacterial (6-4) PLs with a distance of over 3.3 Å. These differences might increase the affinity of DMRL with Vc (6-4) PL. FAD has a U-shaped conformation in the α-helical domain (Fig. 3A). The N5 and O4 of FAD form hydrogen bonds with W7 and additional hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group of Tyr398 and NH1 atom of Arg376 residue (Fig. 3B). As previously suggested for other PLs (17Oberpichler I. Pierik A.J. Wesslowski J. Pokorny R. Rosen R. Vugman M. et al.A photolyase-like protein from Agrobacterium tumefaciens with an iron-sulfur cluster.PLoS One. 2011; 6e26775Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) these critical interactions may also serve a stabilization function Vc (6-4) PL. Unlike At (6-4) PL or Rs (6-4) PL, Vc (6-4) PL Glu410 amino acid faces away from FAD and interacts with Asp395 rather than a His365 residue (Fig. 3B). This results in a much-relaxed interaction between the residues due to hydrogen bonding formation rather than salt bridge formation in Vc (6-4) PL. Although the reaction mechanism of the CPD PLs has been elucidated, (6-4) PLs are not yet fully characterized. There are different mechanisms that are proposed for the (6–4) PL mechanism during DNA repair (7Zhong D. Electron transfer mechanisms of DNA repair by photolyase.Annu. Rev. Phys.

In fact, mutagenesis studies with Drosophila melanogaster (Dm (6-4)) PL indicated that replacement of His365 with Asn365 results in the loss of its DNA repair activity, while mutagenesis of His369 into Met369 results in a highly reduced activity of Dm (6-4) PL (28Maul M.J. Barends T.R.M. Glas A.F. Cryle M.J. Domratcheva T. Schneider S. et al.Crystal structure and mechanism of a DNA (6-4) photolyase.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2008; 47: 10076-10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, mutagenesis studies with corresponding amino acid residues in Xenopus (6-4) PL showed a complete loss of activity (29Hitomi K. Nakamura H. Kim S.T. Mizukoshi T. Ishikawa T.

Femtosecond spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis suggest initial electron transfer from excited flavin induces transfer of a proton from a histidine on the active site of the enzyme to the (6–4) photoproduct (7Zhong D. Electron transfer mechanisms of DNA repair by photolyase.Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 2015; 66: 691-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Li J. Liu Z. Tan C. Guo X. Wang L. Sancar A. et al.Dynamics and mechanism of repair of ultraviolet-induced (6-4) photoproduct by photolyase.Nature. 2010; 466: 887-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Catalytically active His373 (corresponds to His365 of the Dm (6-4) PL) is conserved in Vc (6-4) PL (Fig. 3C). In addition, there are other conserved amino acid residues in the motif. For instance, His372 and Arg376 (corresponds to His364 and Arg368 of the Dm (6-4) PL) are conserved in Vc (6-4) PL (Fig. 3C). However, the conformation of the Vc (6-4) PL His372 is significantly different from the Dm (6-4) PL His364, which may suggest an alternate function of this residue. The high-resolution Vc (6-4) PL structure contains an iron–sulfur cluster with an unknown function and a well-defined electron density (Fig. 4A). Its interactions with the surrounding cysteine amino acids are summarized in Figure 4B. Cys357, Cys445, Cys448, and Cys461 sulfide atoms make bonds with Fe atoms in the cluster with each bond at 2.3 Å distance. The function of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is currently unknown; however, its distance to the FAD is 17 Å, which indicates it does not have a catalytic role in the DNA repair due to its large distance to the active site region. [4Fe-4S] clusters are well-known for their oxygen sensitivity, and under aerobic conditions, they quickly decompose into [3Fe-4S] clusters and can further dissociate into [2Fe-2S]. Mostly, the decomposition of the cluster deactivates the cluster-containing enzymes, and handling and purification of these enzymes require using a glovebox to prevent decomposition of the oxygen-sensitive [4Fe-4S] clusters. In the case of Vc (6-4) PL, the entire expression, purification, and crystallization procedures were performed in atmospheric conditions that took months. In our structure, there was no observable damage in the [4Fe-4S] cluster, which might indicate the cluster in the PL is unusually oxygen tolerant. The DNA-binding region of the Vc (6-4) PL has a defined electron density that covers the amino acids Asn178, Phe179, Asp180, Ala181, Asp182, Asn183, Arg184, and Asn185 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, this region has not a well-defined electron density in At (6-4) PL structures obtained in either cryogenic (PDB ID: 4DJA) or ambient temperature (PDB ID: 6DD6) conditions (Fig. 5, B and C). A similar analysis was carried out with Rs (6-4) PL, where there is a well-defined electron density in the same region (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that while this region is highly stable in Rs (6-4) PL and Vc (6-4) PL, it is flexible and disordered in At (6-4) PL structure and, therefore, this region has species-specific stability differences. Notably, we have not observed a distinct electron density of amino acid residues between 478 and 485 Vc (6-4) PL (Fig. 6A). However, this region has well-defined structures in other bacterial PLs (Fig. 6, B–D). Interestingly, this region is adjacent to the 23rd helix, which is one of the positively surface-charged helices around the catalytic region (Fig. 7A). When we superimposed Vc (6-4) PL with Dm (6-4) PL (PDB ID: 3CVU) with (6-4) T-T, this region and the 23rd helix were seen to pass through damaged DNA (Fig. 7B). This observation suggests that the region between 478 and 485 Vc (6-4) PL might be a DNA-binding region and further stabilizes after interacting with the DNA lesion. Upon investigation of the C-terminus of Vc (6-4) PL and Dm (6-4) PL, two additional helices were identified on Vc (6-4) PL and the 23rd helix seems to be blocking the DNA lesion in superimposed structure. Further analysis of superimposed structures indicated that the catalytic cofactor FADs are in similar conformation and their RMSD is 0.7 Å (Fig. 7C). To DNA lesions to bind the bacterial (6-4) PL, while still interacting with the FAD, there may be conformational changes on the 23rd helix to provide a gap for DNA lesion. B-factor analysis showed that 23rd helix has the highest B-factor values in the structure and therefore, it has the highest probability to undergo a conformational change (Fig. 7D). According to the superimposition of DNA lesion from Dm (6-4) PL with Vc (6-4) PL, which is compatible with a prototypical PL–DNA-binding mode, helix α23 of Vc (6-4) PL interacts with the DNA, while helix α24 looks away from the DNA lesion. The surface charge of helix α23 is positive, which is consistent with its role in DNA binding. The last two helixes (α23 and α24) are missing in Dm (6-4) PL or most of the other PLs, which indicates they may play a regulatory role rather than their involvement in repair activity.Figure 7DNA-binding comparison between Vc (6-4) PL and Dm (6-4) PL.

Different types of PLs have been discovered, and they are shown to repair two different types of DNA damages: CPDs (Pyr<>Pyr) and Pyr-Pyr photoproducts (Pyr[6–4]Pyr). CPD photoproducts are mainly repaired by CPD PLs, while (6-4) photoproducts are being repaired by (6-4) PLs (12Sancar A. Structure and function of DNA photolyase and cryptochrome blue-light photoreceptors.Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of CPD PLs is elucidated at in vivo levels (1, 5, & 6). On the other hand, different reaction mechanisms are proposed for the (6-4) PL. The (6-4) PLs are initially thought to be specifically present in eukaryotes (13Zhang F. Scheerer P. Oberpichler I. Lamparter T. Krauss N. Crystal structure of a prokaryotic (6-4) photolyase with an Fe-S cluster and a 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine antenna chromophore.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Comparison of the crystal structure of the Vc (6-4) PL with other known bacterial (6-4) PLs indicated that cofactor-binding regions are well conserved with some differences: a water molecule interacts with the Asp106 in Vc (6-4) PL with a very short distance compared to the At and Rs (6-4) PLs, where the water molecule interacts with Gly105 (Fig. 2B). The FAD-binding region of the Vc (6-4) PL is highly conserved. However, one notable difference is that Glu410 makes a hydrogen bond with Asp395; whereas, in the case of Glu399 (corresponds to Glu410 of Vc (6-4) PL), it makes a salt bridge with His384 (corresponds to Asp395 of Vc (6-4) PL) At (6-4) PL and Rs (6-4) PL (13Zhang F.

Whether such structural difference affects its activity or conformation of FAD needs to be further investigated. The His-His-X-X-Arg motif in (6-4) PLs are shown to be important for their catalytic activity (16Geisselbrecht Y. Fruhwirth S. Schroeder C. Pierik A.J. Klug G. Essen L.O.

This motif is also conserved in the Vc (6-4) PL. Further conformational comparison of the Vc (6-4) PL and Dm (6-4) PL of this motif indicates His373 and Arg376 of Dm (6-4) PL have identical configuration, while His372 (His364 of Dm (6-4) PL) acquired a different configuration, which may reveal similar/different functionalities between species. One of the major differences between Vc (6-4) PL and At (6-4) PL structures is their predicted DNA-binding site (Fig. 5). The predicted site (amino acid residues between 178 and 185) of Vc (6-4) PL has a distinct structure compared to that of At (6-4) PL, where the corresponding region has no well-defined structure (17Oberpichler I. Pierik A.J. Wesslowski J. Pokorny R. Rosen R.

The same region of Rs (6-4) PL also has a well-ordered electron density map except for its Arg residue (16Geisselbrecht Y. Fruhwirth S. Schroeder C. Pierik A.J. Klug G. Essen L.O. CryB from Rhodobacter sphaeroides: a unique class of cryptochromes with new cofactors.EMBO Rep. 2012; 13: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which indicates species-specific stability differences of DNA-binding domains. Comparison of Vc (6-4) PL and At (6-4) PL revealed that Vc (6-4) PL has an unstructured region with eight amino acid residues (Fig. 6A), which might be a DNA-binding region and is also conserved in other bacterial PLs. Arg483 might form a salt bridge with (6-4) photoproduct that stabilizes the disordered region. The general structure of Vc and Dm (6-4) PLs are highly similar except in C terminus, where Vc (6-4) PLs contain additional two helixes. Due to the position of the 23rd helix, DNA lesions cannot bind the Vc (6-4) PL similar to Dm (6-4) PL (Fig. 7B). However, the FADs are located in an extremely similar manner, which indicates a similar DNA lesion binding between the PLs (Fig. 7C). A conformational change upon DNA binding at the Vc (6-4) PL might open a space for DNA to bind. The 23rd helix is the main candidate for the conformational change, as it is the major blocker of the DNA and has the largest B-factor (Fig. 7D). Full-length (6-4) PL from V. cholerae O1 bivar Tor str. N16961 in a pET28a(+) vector between NdeI and BamHI cut sites was purchased from GenScript Biotech Corporation as codon optimized for E. coli protein expression. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 Rosetta-2 strain and grown in 4.5 L of LB-Miller liquid growth media supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol antibiotics at 37 °C with 110 rpm shaking. When A600 reached to 0.8, induction of bacterial protein expression was performed by adding 0.4 mM of IPTG as the final concentration, and induction was performed at 18 °C for 24 h. The culture was centrifuged at 2850 g for 45 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was stored at −80 °C until further use. Lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) was added into pellets, and sonication (Branson W250 sonifier) was performed for 45 s at 60% power 3 times. Samples were ultracentrifuged at 35,000 rpm with a Ti-45 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 1 h at 4 °C; subsequently, the supernatant was filtered with a 45 μm cellulose mixed ester filter (ISOLAB) and then applied to Ni-NTA agarose resin (QIAGEN). The column was equilibrated with His A buffer containing 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5 (v/v), and 5% glycerol (v/v); then the sample was loaded with 2.5 ml/min flow rate. Washing of the column was performed with His A buffer, and protein was eluted with His B buffer, containing 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 250 mM imidazole, and 5% glycerol (v/v) into 5 ml of 100% glycerol to prevent protein precipitation. Yellow-colored (6-4) PL was flash frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C with a final concentration of 25% glycerol (v/v). Initial crystallization screening experiments were setup with a 5 mg/ml final concentration of Vc (6-4) PL with the sitting drop, microbatch screening (under oil) method at 4 °C by mixing 0.83 μl of protein with an equal volume of commercial crystallization screening conditions in 72-well Terasaki plates. The well containing the protein:cocktail mixture was covered with 16.6 μl of parafilm oil to allow slow evaporation of solvents. Approximately, 3500 commercially available crystal screening conditions were tested, and the yellow-colored crystals were observed at Wizard Synergy #40 (Rigaku Corporation), which contains 2 M of ammonium citrate/citric acid pH 7.5 and 5% PEG 400 (v/v) after 7 weeks. The conditions were further optimized by mixing 0.5 μl Cryo-Pro #45 (Hampton Research), which contain 1 M sodium sulfate decahydrate, 1 μl of protein, and 1 μl of Wizard Synergy #40. The crystals were flash frozen by quickly plunging them into liquid nitrogen, and data collection was performed at 100 K. Two X-ray diffraction datasets were collected at 2.0 Å and 2.5 Å resolutions from two large crystals with a wavelength of 1.54 Å at the University of Health Sciences with Rigaku’s XtaLAB Synergy Flow X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation). The PhotonJet-R (Rigaku Corporation) X-ray generator was operated at 40 kV and 30 mA with a 23% beam intensity to mitigate the radiation damage during data collection. HyPix-Arc-150° detector (Rigaku Corporation) was used with a 60 mm detector distance. To further minimize the exposure time, we preferred not to collect fine-sliced oscillation data rather 1-degree oscillation scan width low X-ray dose chosen with 15 and 30 s exposure times. The total run time for two data collections was 1 h 11 m 30 s and 2 h 33 min 0 s, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W4311465685,"Twinkle is the ring-shaped replicative helicase within the human mitochondria with high homology to bacteriophage T7 gp4 helicase-primase. Unlike many orthologs of Twinkle, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of human Twinkle has lost its primase activity through evolutionarily acquired mutations. The NTD has no demonstrated activity thus far; its role has remained unclear. Here, we biochemically characterize the isolated NTD and C-terminal domain (CTD) with linker to decipher their contributions to full-length Twinkle activities. This novel CTD construct hydrolyzes ATP, has weak DNA unwinding activity, and assists DNA polymerase γ (Polγ)-catalyzed strand-displacement synthesis on short replication forks. However, CTD fails to promote multikilobase length product formation by Polγ in rolling-circle DNA synthesis. Thus, CTD retains all the motor functions but struggles to implement them for processive translocation. We show that NTD has DNA-binding activity, and its presence stabilizes Twinkle oligomerization. CTD oligomerizes on its own, but the loss of NTD results in heterogeneously sized oligomeric species. The CTD also exhibits weaker and salt-sensitive DNA binding compared with full-length Twinkle. Based on these results, we propose that NTD directly contributes to DNA binding and holds the DNA in place behind the central channel of the CTD like a ""doorstop,"" preventing helicase slippages and sustaining processive unwinding. Consistent with this model, mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) compensate for the NTD loss and partially restore kilobase length DNA synthesis by CTD and Polγ. The implications of our studies are foundational for understanding the mechanisms of disease-causing Twinkle mutants that lie in the NTD."
https://openalex.org/W4311752809,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a multifunctional protein that exhibits a wide range of biological effects. Most commonly, it acts as a mitogen, but it also has regulatory, morphological, and endocrine effects. The four receptor subtypes of FGF are activated by more than 20 different FGF ligands. FGF2, one of the FGF ligands, is an essential factor for cell culture in stem cells for regenerative medicine; however, recombinant FGF2 is extremely unstable. Here, we successfully generated homobivalent agonistic single-domain antibodies (variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain antibodies referred to as VHHs) that bind to domain III and induce activation of the FGF receptor 1 and thus transduce intracellular signaling. This agonistic VHH has similar biological activity (EC50) as the natural FGF2 ligand. Furthermore, we determined that the agonistic VHH could support the proliferation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and human mesenchymal stem cells, which are PSCs for regenerative medicine. In addition, the agonistic VHH could maintain the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into adipocytes or osteocytes, indicating that it could maintain the properties of PSCs. These results suggest that the VHH agonist may function as an FGF2 mimetic in cell preparation of stem cells for regenerative medicine with better cost effectiveness.

Broad-spectrum mitogens, such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), by definition, play a role in a variety of cellular functions that include migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Furthermore, FGFs potently induce differentiation and proliferation against various tissue-specific stem cells including bone marrow–derived mesenchymal, hematopoietic, neural, spermatogonial, and prostate (1Xie Y.

Some FGF family members (FGF2, FGF4, FGF6, FGF7, FGF8, and FGF9) reportedly affect the stemness of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Among them, FGF2 and FGF4 have been clearly demonstrated to be highly pertinent in maintaining mouse and human stem cells in the undifferentiated state. Although human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) express all four FGF receptors (FGFRs), it has been reported that the binding of FGF2 to FGFR1, considered the most important receptor, activates downstream signaling including mitogen-activated protein kinases (Ras/Raf–MEK–MAPKs), PI3K/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), PLCγ, and the signal transducer and activator of the transcription pathway (1Xie Y.

That is, FGF2 is mandatory for restraining the pluripotency state of hiPSCs (6Nakagawa M. Koyanagi M. Tanabe K. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T.

Sci. 2018; 19: 1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). With the establishment of culture methods for ESCs and the discovery of iPSCs in the past few decades, there has been a growing need for synthetic alternatives to FGF2. Although considered quite useful, recombinant FGF2 has low thermal stability and shows inconsistency between batches that may reduce the integrity of the stem cell culture. The high cost of production has restrained the scalability of stem cell culture and so, basic research in stem cell–based regenerative therapy is not robust. Synthetic alternatives for FGF2, therefore, are of importance in stem cell–based regenerative medicines (8Hui Q. Jin Z. Li X. Liu C. Wang X. FGF family: from drug development to clinical application.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19: 1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One approach has been to generate artificial agonists of FGFR1. The FGFR gene family includes FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4. It is known that FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 generate alternative splicing variants of immunoglobulin-like domain III (IIIb and IIIc) that are important in the determination of ligand-binding specificity. FGF2 binds to FGFR1, helped by heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans for the induction of dimerization, leading to the phosphorylation of FGFR1. Therefore, most FGFR1 agonists have been designed to induce dimerization of FGFR1. At this time, none of them have been used as an alternative for FGF2 because of low efficacy. It may be that these artificial agonists, compared with native ligands, do not mimic the mode of dimerization or induce the activation of the receptor. Another approach is to use DNA aptamers that act as functional mimics of FGF2 (9Ueki R. Atsuta S. Ueki A. Hoshiyama J. Li J. Hayashi Y. et al.DNA aptamer assemblies as fibroblast growth factor mimics and their application in stem cell culture.Chem. Commun. 2019; 55: 2672-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most potent aptamer assemblies (dimers) are composed of two single-stranded DNAs and could support the self-renewal and pluripotency of iPSCs. However, this failed to sustain long-term maintenance of stem cells. Single-domain antibodies, VHHs (variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain antibodies), are minimal and monomeric antigen-binding domains derived from camelid single-chain antibodies (10Hoey R.J. Eom H. Horn J.R. Structure and development of single domain antibodies as modules for therapeutics and diagnostics.Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2019; 244: 1568-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). VHHs are highly soluble, stable, readily constructed into multivalent formats, and amenable to low cost and efficient bacterial production. Herein, we report homobivalent VHHs that can induce FGFR1 dimerization and thereby activate downstream MAPK/extracellular signal–regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling pathways. Anti-FGFR1 VHHs, isolated from a coupled screening (complementary DNA [cDNA] display (11Yamaguchi J. Naimuddin M. Biyani M. Sasaki T. Machida M.

Concerning thermal stability, the VHHs we obtained showed a Tm value as high as 77.9 °C. Although the monovalent VHHs do not activate intracellular (IC) signaling such as the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, they result in effective agonist activity by producing homobivalent VHHs with various linkers such as the GSGGG linker. We further demonstrate that homobivalent VHHs have stronger biological activity than FGF2, suggesting that they merit further investigation as a promising candidate for cellular response. As far as we know, our homobivalent VHHs are the first example of agonist antibodies based on VHHs, opening a new opportunity to generate artificial agonists for various receptors. The cDNA display technique enables in vitro selection to identify the various kinds of binders from large naïve VHH libraries, currently over 1013 in size; it was difficult to choose the strongest binder with cDNA display alone. On the other hand, the phage display is a powerful tool for selecting binders that bind with high affinity and specificity to target molecules under stringent condition. As shown in Figure 1A, we carried out a coupled screening with both cDNA and phage displays to isolate high-affinity binders. First, binders against a soluble FGFR1 extracellular domain (FGFR1 ED) were selected after the fourth-round screening from the initial VHH cDNA display library with a diversity of 1013 clones. The VHH genes from the pool of binders from the cDNA display were PCR amplified and then transferred into a phagemid vector. Phage display panning was then performed twice to select high-affinity binders. The phage ELISA at each panning was performed to guarantee the presence of the binders. The ELISA data indicated that the pooled phage mixture contained positive clones (Fig. 1B). Next, to select positive single clones from the mixture, the binders were further subjected to selection, and 13 of the 15 clones clearly did bind to the antigen (Fig. 1C). DNA sequence analyses of the 15 selected clones (Fig. 1C) showed that two were unique clones with similar complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. To confirm binding activities to FGFR1 ED, colony 1 and colony 9, thereafter designated as clone VM34 and clone VM35 (Fig. S1A), respectively, were inserted into an expression vector in Corynebacterium glutamicum. Next, clone VM34 and clone VM35 were subsequently expressed and purified from a culture medium (Fig. S1, B and C). The FGFR1 (IIIc)-Fc was immobilized onto a Biacore sensor chip, and the binding activities were determined. Clone VM34 and clone VM35 bound to the target with a KD of 1.74 and 1.02 nM, respectively (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Furthermore, a competition binding assay suggested that both clone VM34 and clone VM35 bound to a similar region (Fig. 2B). This result was consistent with a high similarity between the CDR3 sequences from clone VM34 and clone VM35. Briefly, the amino-acid residues of VM34 in CDR3 (S98–Y104, Y106–P109, and G111–V114) are the same as those of VM35, whereas only two residues are different from each other: L105 and G110 differ from VM34; Y105 and Q110 differ from VM35 (Fig. S1A). The thermal stability analysis of the differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) measurements revealed that clone VM34 has a higher Tm (Table 2), suggesting it should be suitable as a protein engineering candidate for FGFR1 agonist.Table 1SPR analysis of binding kinetics of VM34 and VM35 for each receptorReceptorVM34VM35kon (1/Ms)koff (1/s)KD (M)kon (1/Ms)koff (1/s)KD (M)FGFR1 (IIIb)2.74 × 1052.54 × 10−29.28 × 10−8Not determinedFGFR1 (IIIc)8.19 × 1051.42 × 10−31.74 × 10−91.11 × 1061.14 × 10−31.02 × 10−9FGFR2 (IIIb)No bindingNot determinedFGFR2 (IIIc)4.84 × 1057.76 × 10−11.60 × 10−6Not determinedFGFR3 (IIIb)No bindingNot determinedFGFR3 (IIIc)2.32 × 1052.35 × 10−11.01 × 10−6Not determinedFGFR42.37 × 1065.27 × 10−22.22 × 10−8Not determined Open table in a new tab Table 2Thermal stabilities of VHHsVHHsTm (°C)Tagg266 (°C)Clone VM3477.946.1Clone VM3574.750.2Clone VM34-5aa81.034.3Clone VM34-10aa78.337.5Clone VM34-20aa85.364.1Clone VM34-L380.744.3Clone VM34-L482.350.0 Open table in a new tab The FGFR gene family is comprised of four members—FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4.

The dissociation rates of clone VM34 for FGFR1 (IIIb), FGFR2 (IIIc), and FGFR3 (IIIc) were significantly faster, resulting in a decrease in the binding affinity for each FGFR (Fig. 2C and Table 1). These results indicate that the IIIc region in domain III contains the binding site. Furthermore, the sequence alignment and structural comparison of domain III from FGFR1 (IIIc), FGFR2 (IIIc), and FGFR3 (IIIc) show that the IIIc region is conserved among these receptors, resulting in the different areas that are the potential binding epitope for VM34: region I, II, or III (Figs. S2 and S3). We also analyzed the binding affinity for FGFR4. The SPR experiments revealed that clone VM34 associates and dissociates faster with FGFR4 than with FGFR1 (IIIc) (Fig. 2C and Table 1). This result is consistent with the higher sequence similarity between domain III of FGFR1 (IIIc) and FGFR4 (Fig. S3A). The optical length of dimerization on FGFR1 by FGF2 is important for its activation (16Decker C.G. Wang Y. Paluck S.J. Shen L. Loo J.A. Levine A.J. et al.Fibroblast growth factor 2 dimer with superagonist in vitro activity improves granulation tissue formation during wound healing.Biomaterials. 2016; 81: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated homobivalent VHHs linked with various lengths: 5aa, 10aa, 20aa, L3, and L4. The 5aa, 10aa, and 20aa consisted of a C- to N-terminal fusion of clone VM34 or clone VM35 via a 5-, 10-, or 20-amino acid Gly-Ser linker, respectively, whereas the L3 and L4 consisted of another flexible linker (Fig. S1, B and C). The SPR experiments showed that the homobivalent VHHs have 20- to 40-fold higher affinity to FGFR1 (IIIc) than monovalent VHHs (Fig. 2D and Table 3). Next, using DSF and static light scattering (SLS) techniques, we characterized the biophysical properties of these homobivalent VHHs. These homobivalent VHHs exhibited good thermal stabilities (Table 2).Table 3SPR analysis of binding kinetics of homobivalent VM34 for FGFR1 (IIIc) and FGFR4VHHsFGFR1(IIIc)FGFR4kon (1/Ms)koff (1/s)KD (M)kon (1/Ms)koff (1/s)KD (M)VM34-5aa4.62 × 1052.69 × 10−45.82 × 10−107.61 × 1054.81 × 10−46.31 × 10−10VM34-10aa4.75 × 1052.44 × 10−45.13 × 10−107.84 × 1054.35 × 10−35.55 × 10−10VM34-20aa3.21 × 1052.03 × 10−46.32 × 10−106.68 × 1053.83 × 10−45.73 × 10−10VM34-L33.20 × 1052.25 × 10−47.05 × 10−105.46 × 1054.14 × 10−47.58 × 10−10VM34-L45.84 × 1052.17 × 10−43.72 × 10−108.68 × 1053.87 × 10−44.46 × 10−10 Open table in a new tab To get more insight into those VHHs, we investigated the effect of VHH binding to FGFR on the signaling pathway in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells and its proliferation. The FGF2 ligand binds to FGFR mediated by heparin sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface and then induces structural changes in FGFR dimers leading to activation of the IC signaling pathways, such as MAPKs. Erk1/2 are activated by MAPK factors and associated with growth, differentiation and proliferation. As shown in Figure 3, FGF2 induced the phosphorylation of Erk1/2. The monovalent clone VM34 did not induce the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, whereas VM35 showed weak activity (Fig. S4). These results suggest that it is difficult to activate FGFR1 by using monovalent VHHs. On the other hand, homobivalent VHHs activated the Erk1/2 phosphorylation, such as the natural ligand FGF2 (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the homobivalent clone VM34 stimulated cell proliferation, with an EC50 value stronger than that of FGF2 (340–440 pM versus 470 pM, respectively); whereas the homobivalent clone VM35 showed weaker growth potential for NIH3T3, suggesting that it is important to select the suitable clone for generating the VHH agonist (Fig. 3, B and C). Next, we investigated the maintenance of undifferentiated state on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Both the FGF2 ligand and the homobivalent VHH agonists could maintain cell proliferation ability for 25 days and induce no change in cell morphology (Fig. 4A). Cell surface marker analysis by flow cytometry showed that the cells cultured with medium containing FGF2 or homobivalent VHH agonist were positive for CD90, CD105, and CD73, which corresponds to the definition of MSCs according to the International Society for Cellular Therapy (Fig. 4B). hMSCs, somatic stem cells, are present in a wide range of tissues, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, placenta, umbilical cord, and pulp. Depending on the culture conditions, the cells can differentiate into various strains, such as osteoblasts, adipocytes, or chondrocytes. Here, we tested differentiation ability into adipocytes or osteoblasts of hMSCs. hMSCs maintained either with the FGF2 ligand or the homobivalent VHH agonist equally differentiated into adipocytes and osteoblasts, both types of cells (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that the homobivalent VHHs have the potential to act as useful and artificial alternatives to recombinant FGF2. Finally, we assessed the effect of the expansion ability of a human iPS cell line, 253G1. Every 7 days, cell aggregates were disassembled into single cells, reseeded into 6-well plates, and cultured in medium containing FGF2 ligand or the homobivalent VHH. As shown in Fig. S5A, the cell number increased by approximately 10,000,000-fold over 28 days. Furthermore, the FGF2 ligand and the homobivalent VHH agonist could induce cell proliferation with no change in cell morphology (Fig. S5B). After long-term expansion culture, most cells were positive for OCT4 and SSEA4 (Fig. S5C). These results suggest that the homobivalent VHH agonist can maintain the undifferentiated state of 253G1 for long-term culture. A 26-residue peptide identified by phage display has been reported to be an artificial alternative to FGF2 (17Ballinger M.D. Shyamala V. Forrest L.D. Deuter-Reinhard M. Doyle L.V. Wang J.X. et al.Semirational design of a potent, artificial agonist of fibroblast growth factor receptors.Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This peptide was found to specifically bind to the FGFR1c ED but showed no FGF ligand homology. Ballinger et al. (17Ballinger M.D. Shyamala V. Forrest L.D. Deuter-Reinhard M. Doyle L.V. Wang J.X. et al.Semirational design of a potent, artificial agonist of fibroblast growth factor receptors.Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) fused this polypeptide with the c-Jun leucine zipper domain that binds heparin and forms homodimers and found it specifically reproduced, with the same potency, the mitogenic and morphogenic activities of FGF2. For this activity, interaction with heparin was necessary, which illustrates the importance of heparin for FGFR activation even with ligands unrelated to the FGF structure. Ueki et al. (9Ueki R. Atsuta S. Ueki A. Hoshiyama J. Li J. Hayashi Y. et al.DNA aptamer assemblies as fibroblast growth factor mimics and their application in stem cell culture.Chem. Commun. 2019; 55: 2672-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported using a DNA aptamer in the maintenance of iPSCs and showed that the DNA aptamer mimics the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF2). The most potent aptamer assembly (named TD0) consisting only of 76-mer single-stranded DNA may possibly support the self-renewal and pluripotency of iPSCs. However, the protocol for long-term culture using TD0 was found to be unable to sustain the expression of pluripotent markers in hiPSCs, indicating that the agonists may not concisely mimic the pattern of activation of IC signaling induced by bFGF. Here, FGFR1 is most abundantly expressed in several human ESC lines and thus was selected for the target molecule. Natural FGF ligands are extremely unstable, which is a clinical obstacle. Therefore, we attempted to create a VHH-based agonist with exceptional structural and thermal stabilities. Both VHHs, clone VM34 and clone VM35, exhibited excellent thermal stability with a Tm of 77.9 and 74.7 °C, respectively. The binding affinity studies were conducted mainly with clone VM34, which has the same binding epitope on FGFR1 as clone VM35 but has better thermal stability. The binding characteristics against various receptors were analyzed (Table 1). Clone VM34 bound to both splice variants of FGFR1, IIIb and IIIc and bound to FGFR2 (IIIc) and FGFR3 (IIIc). Members of the FGF family including FGF2, FGF4, FGF6, FGF7, FGF8, and FGF9 have been reported to impact the stemness of PSCs. The multiple signals from FGF/FGFR may provide some benefit. However, the value of binding activities to FGFR2 (IIIc) and FGFR3 (IIIc) was about 1000 times lower than to FGFR1 (IIIc). Therefore, it is doubtful whether it functions on target cells under physiological conditions, and thus we are awaiting future evaluation. Importantly, clone VM34 also has a high affinity to FGFR4 and is expected to give an advantageous effect because it has been clearly demonstrated that FGF2 and FGF4 are highly pertinent to maintain mouse and human stem cells in the undifferentiated state. Based on the binding properties to FGFRs, the sequence alignments, and the structural comparisons, the binding site of a VHH can be predicted to be on domain III (Fig. S3B). Recently, an activation model of FGFR1 has been proposed according to the crystal structure of the FGFR1 ED–FGF2–heparin complex and quantitative imaging-FRET methodology (18Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. et al.Crystal structure of a ternary FGF-FGFR-heparin complex reveals a dual role for heparin in FGFR binding and dimerization.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 19Sarabipour S. Hristova K. Mechanism of FGF receptor dimerization and activation.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 10262Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In this model, FGFR1 is mainly monomeric under physiological conditions, and the binding of FGF2 induces its dimerization and activation because of the structural changes of the transmembrane and IC domains. Our binding analysis revealed that clone VM34 and clone VM35 bind to domain III on FGFR1 (Figs. 2 and S3); the functional assay showed that the homobivalent VHHs induces the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, the cell proliferation, and the maintenance of undifferentiated state on PSCs (Figs. 3, 4, and S5). These results suggest that, in the activation model, the homobivalent VHH connects to domain III, and that the structural changes of the transmembrane and IC domains cause an increase in the phosphorylation activity of FGFR1, resulting in proliferation of undifferentiated PSCs (Fig. 5). Most importantly, the successive screening procedure can be applied to the selection of high-affinity VHHs. Indeed, the recent results in our laboratory indicate that high-affinity VHHs against various targets can be obtained using similar screening strategies described herein (data not shown). Furthermore, the methodologies of engineering applied to VHHs are applicable for the generation of artificial agonists because VHHs have size suitable for inducing agonist effects against EDs of receptors on a cell, which are smaller than immunoglobulin G (IgG) and larger than peptides. An alpaca-derived VHH cDNA display library was prepared according to previous methods (15Jayathilake C. Kumachi S. Arai H. Motohashi M. Terai T. Murakami A. et al.In vitro selection of anti-gliadin single-domain antibodies from a naive library for cDNA-display mediated immuno-PCR.Anal. Biochem. 2020; 589: 113490Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, the alpaca-derived VHH cDNA library was provided by Dr Murakami at RePHAGEN, Inc. The DNA fragments for the cDNA display, composed of 5′ UTR (T7 promoter, omega [Ω] enhancer, and Kozak consensus sequence), VHH gene, His-tag region, and 3′ UTR linker hybridization region were transcribed and photocrosslinked with the 3-cyanovinylcarbazole nucleoside (cnvK) puromycin linker (20Yoshimura Y. Fujimoto K. Ultrafast reversible photo-cross-linking reaction: toward in situ DNA manipulation.Org. Lett. 2008; 10: 3227-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The photocrosslinked product was subjected to an in vitro translation reaction to synthesize mRNA display molecule. The mRNA display molecule was immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (SA beads, Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc) and reverse transcribed to synthesize the cDNA display molecules. The RNase T1 (Thermo Fisher) was added to release cDNA display molecules. The supernatant containing the cDNA display molecules was collected, and purification was carried out using nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid magnetic beads (His Mag Sepharose Ni; Cytiva). The FGFR1β (IIIc)/Fc (R&D Systems) and IgG1 (Fc) Human (R&D Systems) were purchased and biotinylated using a 20-fold molar quantity of EZ-link sulfo NHS-SS Biotin (Thermo Fisher) at 25 °C for 30 min and buffer-exchanged by desalting columns (Zeba Spin Desalting Columns; Thermo Fisher). In the initial round of selection, the 100 pmol of biotinylated FGFR1β (IIIc)/Fc was immobilized on the SA beads. The cDNA display prepared from 192 pmol of mRNA-formed VHH library in 100 μl of selection buffer was mixed and incubated at 25 °C for 60 min. After four times washing with the selection buffer, the beads were incubated in 40 μl of selection buffer containing 20 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine at room temperature (RT) for 15 min to elute the binding cDNA display molecules by cleavage of the disulfide bond. The supernatant containing cDNA display molecules was collected. The beads were then further incubated in 10 μl of 10 mM NaOH at RT for 10 min. The supernatant containing cDNA display molecules was neutralized with 2 μl of 1 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.0). The above NaOH elution was performed twice. To prepare the cDNA library for the next round of selection, the cDNA attached to the cDNA display was PCR amplified. A total of five rounds of in vitro selection was performed according to the aforementioned protocol with minor changes as follows: the cDNA display VHH libraries were prepared from 12 pmol of mRNA in the second round, from 6 pmol in the third round, and from 3 pmol in the fourth and fifth rounds. The biotinylated FGFR1β (IIIc)/Fc was successively decreased from 100 to 10 pmol. To reduce the background signal, the cDNA display libraries in the second to the fifth rounds were subjected to prescreening with the SA beads immobilized on 100 pmol of biotinylated human IgG1 (Fc) molecules. After the cDNA display selection, the selected VHH genes were PCR amplified using the VHH-specific primers including BamHI and SfiI restriction enzyme sequences. The amplified DNAs encoding VHHs were purified using AMPure XP (Beckman), digested with BamHI and SfiI, and then subcloned into a phagemid vector. The phagemid vector was digested with Ba"

Resection is catalyzed by the resectosome, a multienzyme complex that includes bloom syndrome helicase (BLM), DNA2 or exonuclease 1 nucleases, and additional DNA-binding proteins. Although the molecular players have been known for over a decade, how the individual proteins work together to regulate DNA resection remains unknown. Using single-molecule imaging, we characterized the roles of the MRE11–RAD50–NBS1 complex (MRN) and topoisomerase IIIa (TOP3A)–RMI1/2 during long-range DNA resection. BLM partners with TOP3A–RMI1/2 to form the BTRR (BLM–TOP3A–RMI1/2) complex (or BLM dissolvasome). We determined that TOP3A–RMI1/2 aids BLM in initiating DNA unwinding, and along with MRN, stimulates DNA2-mediated resection. Furthermore, we found that MRN promotes the association between BTRR and DNA and synchronizes BLM and DNA2 translocation to prevent BLM from pausing during resection. Together, this work provides direct observation of how MRN and DNA2 harness the BTRR complex to resect DNA efficiently and how TOP3A–RMI1/2 regulates the helicase activity of BLM to promote efficient DNA repair.

Homologous recombination (HR) is one of two major eukaryotic dsDNA break (DSB) repair pathways. HR uses the intact sister chromatid during the S/G2 phase to promote error-free repair of DSBs (1Jasin M. Rothstein R. Repair of strand breaks by homologous recombination.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

During the initial stages of HR, the BTRR complex promotes long-range DNA2-mediated resection (44Daley J.M. Chiba T. Xue X. Niu H. Sung P.

In later stages of HR, following RAD51 loading and strand invasion, BTRR is critical for the branch migration of Holliday junctions to form a hemicatenane, followed by decatenation by TOP3A–RMI1/2, resulting in noncrossovers (46Bizard A.H.

The Bloom’s syndrome helicase suppresses crossing over during homologous recombination.Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Though the role of TOP3A–RMI1/2 is well defined in the later stages of HR, their precise roles in DNA resection remain unclear. For example, a catalytically inactive TOP3A mutant stimulates long-range DNA resection in vitro, suggesting that TOP3A–RMI1/2 may play a nonenzymatic role in resectosome assembly and/or translocation (20Niu H.

Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence imaging to decipher the functions of individual resectosome components during DNA resection. Both MRN and TOP3A–RMI1/2 help BLM to initiate DNA unwinding. MRN and TOP3A–RMI1/2 also stimulate DNA2-mediated resection. Finally, MRN synchronizes the translocation speeds of BLM and DNA2 to prevent BLM pausing. We reveal that MRN and TOP3A–RMI1/2 are regulatory resectosome components that initiate DNA resection and synchronize the individual motors during kilobase-long DNA processing. To understand how MRN and TOP3A–RMI1/2 regulate DNA processing, we adapted our single-molecule resection assay to quantify the movement of DNA2 or EXO1 in complex with MRN and BTRR (Fig. 1) (28Myler L.R.

We purified RMI1/2 with an N-terminal FLAG epitope on the RMI2 subunit. TOP3A–RMI1/2 was reconstituted by mixing TOP3A and RMI1/2 in a 1:3 ratio, followed by size-exclusion chromatography. These three proteins formed a stable complex that eluted as a single peak on a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) (Fig. S1A). TOP3A–RMI1/2 was then mixed with BLM to assemble the BTRR resectosome and labeled with fluorescent anti-FLAG antibodies (targeting RMI2 as described previously). Biotinylated MRN was conjugated with streptavidin quantum dots (QDs) that emit in spectrally distinct channels (Fig. S1, A and B). We have previously shown that fluorescently labeled MRN retains its biochemical activities, including diffusion along nucleosomal DNA and nucleolytic removal of Ku from DNA ends (28Myler L.R.

In addition, QD-labeled MRN does not prevent interactions with other resectosome components, such as EXO1, consistent with in vivo and ensemble in vitro assays with unlabeled MRN. For the single-molecule resection assay, 48.5-kb-long dsDNAs with biotin on one end and a 78 nt 3′-overhang on the opposite end are organized on the surface of a microfluidic flow cell (Fig. 1B) (49Soniat M.M.

Fluorescent BTRR complex is incubated with MRN and DNA2 or EXO1 before being injected into flow cells for single-molecule imaging (Fig. S1C). As expected, MRN and BTRR in complex with DNA2 and EXO1 bound the free DNA ends and resected the DNA in the presence of 1 nM RPA (Fig. 1C). The MRN–BTRR–DNA2 complex resected DNA for 18 ± 6 kb (mean ± SD; n = 82) with a velocity of 18 ± 11 bp s−1. Omitting either TOP3A–RMI1/2 or MRN decreased BLM–DNA2 velocity for approximately two-fold (BTRR–DNA2: 9 ± 6 bp s−1, n = 94 molecules; MRN–BLM–DNA2: 9 ± 6 bp s−1, n = 30) and decreased processivity by 1.4-fold (BTRR–DNA2: 13 ± 5 kb; MRN–BLM–DNA2: 12 ± 5 kb) (Fig. 1, C–E and Table S1). Our results with the human resectosome are consistent with the stimulation of S. cerevisiae Sgs1–Dna2 by MRX and Top3–Rmi1 (19Cejka P. Cannavo E. Polaczek P. Masuda-Sasa T. Pokharel S.

In contrast, the addition of MRN and TOP3A–RMI1/2 to BLM–EXO1 resectosomes did not change the processivity or velocity (∼12 ± 7 kb; ∼13 ± 10 bp s−1; n > 50 for all conditions), suggesting that MRN and TOP3A–RMI1/2 selectively regulate DNA2-mediated resection (Fig. 1, F and G and Table S1). In addition to its nucleolytic activity, DNA2 also encodes a 5’→3′ helicase domain that can unwind kilobases of dsDNA (54Levikova M. Klaue D. Seidel R. Cejka P.

Multiple roles of DNA2 nuclease/helicase in DNA metabolism, genome stability and human diseases.Nucl. Acids Res. 2020; 48: 16-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We first tested the importance of both DNA2’s nuclease and helicase activity in DNA resection with MRN and the BTRR complex on the 3′-overhang DNA substrate. As expected, the nuclease-deficient DNA2(D277A) inhibited DNA resection (processivity: 2 ± 2 kb; velocity: 2 ± 2 bp s−1, n = 89) (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, a helicase-deficient (hd) DNA2(K654R) mutant decreased resection processivity and velocity (processivity: 13 ± 6 kb; velocity: 11 ± 7 bp s−1, n = 76). Omitting TOP3A–RMI1/2 and MRN abrogated the negative effects of DNA2(K654R) on resection processivity and velocity (14 ± 8 kb; 12 ± 8 bp s−1, n = 42) (Fig. S2, A and B). We repeated the resection experiments with an hd BLM(K695A) mutant on both 5′-overhang and 3′-overhang DNA substrates but did not see long-distance motor activity beyond our ∼500 bp resolution (Fig. S2C). This indicates that the helicase activity of BLM provides a 5′-flap for DNA2. In addition, BLM prevents the initiation of long-range helicase activity by DNA2, even with a 12-nt 5′-overhang. These results are consistent with our previous study that showed that hd BLM also blocks nuclease-dead DNA2 from unwinding DNA (50Soniat M.M. Myler L.R. Kuo H.-C. Paull T.T. Finkelstein I.J. RPA phosphorylation inhibits DNA resection.Mol. Cell. 2019; 75: 145-153.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These results show that both the nuclease and helicase activity of DNA2 are required for rapid long-range DNA processing. Since TOP3A–RMI1/2 and MRN stimulate the BLM–DNA2 resectosome, we tested whether either TOP3A–RMI1/2 and/or MRN can stimulate DNA2 alone. MRN recruits DNA2 to DSBs in human cells but does not affect DNA2 nuclease activity in vitro (30Nimonkar A.V. Genschel J. Kinoshita E. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Wyman C. et al.BLM-DNA2-RPA-MRN and EXO1-BLM-RPA-MRN constitute two DNA end resection machineries for human DNA break repair.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Consistent with this report, 87% of DNA2 molecules colocalized with MRN (n = 97/112) at free DNA ends (Fig. 2, C and D). We saw a more modest 65% of TOP3A–RMI1/2 complexes (n = 22/34) colocalizing with DNA2. DNA2 did not translocate beyond our spatial resolution of ∼500 bp with MRN and TOP3A–RMI1/2 (together or independently) in the presence of RPA. Previous studies showed that suppression of the nuclease activity of DNA2 stimulates processive helicase activity on DNA substrates containing a 5′-flap in the presence of RPA (54Levikova M. Klaue D.

To observe the helicase activity, we monitored nuclease-deficient DNA2(D277A) on DNA substrates containing 12 nt 5′-overhang in the presence of 1 nM RPA, similar to previous studies (54Levikova M. Klaue D. Seidel R. Cejka P. Nuclease activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dna2 inhibits its potent DNA helicase activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2020; 117: 8859-8869Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). DNA2 was a processive helicase, motoring ∼4 ± 2 kb with a velocity of 5 ± 3 bp s−1 (n = 23 molecules) (Fig. 2, E–G and Table S2). The addition of MRN, TOP3A–RMI1/2, or both together had no effect on the processivity of DNA2. However, adding either MRN or TOP3A–RMI1/2 decreased the velocity of DNA2 by ∼1.4-fold relative to DNA2(D277A) alone. In contrast, the addition of both MRN and TOP3A–RMI1/2 restored helicase activity to that of DNA2 alone. These results are broadly consistent with a model where MRN and TOP3A–RMI1/2 help DNA2 engage free DNA ends but do not stimulate its nuclease or motor activities. Next, we investigated how TOP3A–RMI1/2 regulates BLM helicase. BLM was fluorescently labeled via a fluorescent anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody directed to an N-terminal HA epitope, as we described previously (50Soniat M.M. Myler L.R. Kuo H.-C. Paull T.T. Finkelstein I.J. RPA phosphorylation inhibits DNA resection.Mol. Cell. 2019; 75: 145-153.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). TOP3A–RMI1/2 colocalized with BLM at the free DNA ends (Fig. 3A). We recently showed that RPA aids BLM in initiating helicase activity from 3′-ssDNA overhangs (50Soniat M.M. Myler L.R. Kuo H.-C. Paull T.T. Finkelstein I.J. RPA phosphorylation inhibits DNA resection.Mol. Cell. 2019; 75: 145-153.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). When RPA is omitted, only ∼30% of BLM molecules initiate translocation. However, adding TOP3A–RMI1/2 increases the number of translocating BLM molecules ∼2.3-fold (77%; n = 86/111) (Fig. 3B). TOP3A was sufficient to recapitulate most of this stimulation (62%; n = 83/133), whereas adding RMI1/2 alone slightly decreased the number of translocating BLM molecules (19%; n = 34/182). Finally, adding RPA did not further stimulate the number of translocating BTRR complexes (83%; n = 67/81). Surprisingly, although TOP3A–RMI1/2 initiated more BLM helicases, it also decreased the velocity of BLM approximately two-fold (14 ± 11 bp s−1; n = 86) and slightly reduced processivity ∼1.2-fold (14 ± 8 kb) (Fig."

Mental health symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression-10 questionnaire for depression and the Perceived Stress Scale-10 for stress symptoms.The results showed respondents who were males and also the respondents who were ""hanging out"" with more people while drinking alcohol reported significantly lower depressive symptoms and lower stress symptoms. On the contrary, staying home from work or school ""very often"" was associated with higher stress symptoms, compared with ""never/rarely"" staying home from work/school. Similarly, having a job with in-person interaction was also associated with increased stress.These findings suggest that lack of social engagement was associated with depression and stress symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Planning social activities that align with recommended safety precautions, as well as meet students' social needs, should be an important priority for higher education institutions."

Specifically, research led by NMAHPP clinicians (Nursing, Midwifery, Allied health professions, Healthcare science, Psychology and Pharmacy).Semi-structured one-to-one interviews were conducted with health research participants and patient or public advisors. Interviewees were recruited from five UK sites and via social media. Interview transcripts were analysed using Thematic Analysis to identify key themes and areas of disagreement.Twenty-one interviews were completed, and four main themes were identified. The first, optimising research experiences, included personal reflections and broader recommendations to improve participant experiences. The second, connecting health research with healthcare, described research as key for the continued development of healthcare, but illustrated that communication between research teams, participants, and clinicians could be improved. The third theme explored the personal impacts of contributing to research, with interviewees recalling common positive experiences. The final theme discussed capturing research impacts. Interviewees highlighted potential priorities for different stakeholders, but emphasised that financial impacts should not be the sole factor.Individuals who were involved in NMAHPP health research recalled positive experiences and reported good relationships with their research teams. They felt that their contributions were valued. Suggested strategies to optimise the research experience focused on simplifying documentation, clear signposting of the research activities involved, and feedback on the research findings. Routine sharing of relevant research data with clinicians was also recommended. Personal impacts included a deeper understanding of their health condition or health more broadly, and increased confidence interacting with healthcare and other professionals. These findings will be used to inform development of a framework to capture the impact of NMAHPP research."
https://openalex.org/W4311914220,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) is the etiological agent of avian colibacillosis, a leading cause of economic loss to the poultry industry worldwide. APEC causes disease using a diverse repertoire of virulence factors and has the ability to form biofilms, which contributes to the survival and persistence of APEC in harsh environments. The objective of this study was to identify genes most widespread and important in APEC that contribute to APEC biofilm formation. Using the characterized APEC O18 as the template strain, a total of 15,660 mutants were randomly generated using signature tagged mutagenesis and evaluated for decreased biofilm formation ability using the crystal violet assay. Biofilm deficient mutants were sequenced, and a total of 547 putative biofilm formation genes were identified. Thirty of these genes were analyzed by PCR for prevalence among 109 APEC isolates and 104 avian fecal E . coli (AFEC) isolates, resulting in nine genes with significantly greater prevalence in APEC than AFEC. The expression of these genes was evaluated in the wild-type APEC O18 strain using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in both the exponential growth phase and the mature biofilm phase. To investigate the role of these genes in biofilm formation, isogenic mutants were constructed and evaluated for their biofilm production and planktonic growth abilities. Four of the mutants ( rfaY , rfaI , and two uncharacterized genes) displayed significantly decreased biofilm formation, and of those four, one ( rfaI ) displayed significantly decreased growth compared to the wild type. Overall, this study identified novel genes that may be important in APEC and its biofilm formation. The data generated from this study will benefit further investigation into the mechanisms of APEC biofilm formation."
https://openalex.org/W4311914241,"Background There is a critical need for hospital-to-home transitional care interventions to prepare family caregivers for patients’ post-discharge care in rural communities. Four evidence-based interventions (named discharge planning, treatments, warning signs, and physical activity) have the potential to meet this need but family caregivers’ perspectives on the acceptability of the interventions have not been examined. This gap is significant because unacceptable interventions are unlikely to be used or used as designed, thereby undermining outcome achievement. Accordingly, this study examined the perceived acceptability of the four interventions to rural family caregivers. Materials and methods A multi-method descriptive design was used. The quantitative method entailed the administration of an established scale to assess the interventions’ perceived acceptability to family caregivers. The qualitative method involved semi-structured interviews to explore family caregivers’ perceived acceptability of the interventions in greater depth, including acceptable and unacceptable aspects, in the context of their own transitional care experience. Participants were the family caregivers of a relative who had been discharged home in a rural community from an acute care hospital in Ontario, Canada. Results The purposive sample included 16 participants who were mostly middle-aged women (n = 14; 87.5%) caring for a parent (n = 9; 56.3%) at high risk for hospital readmission. The mean scores on the acceptability measure were 3 or higher for all interventions, indicating that, on average, the four interventions were perceived as acceptable. In terms of acceptable aspects, four themes were identified: the interventions: 1) involve family caregivers and proactively prepare them for discharge, 2) provide clear, written, and detailed guidance, 3) place the onus on healthcare providers to initiate communication, and 4) ensure post-discharge follow-up. In terms of unacceptable aspects, one theme was identified: the physical activity intervention would be challenging to implement. Discussion The findings support implementing the four interventions in practice throughout the hospital-to-home transition. Healthcare providers should assess family caregivers’ comfort in participating in the physical activity intervention and tailor their role accordingly."

All included subjects had preoperative oblique astigmatism. Residual refractive error and visual acuity (uncorrected and corrected) were the measures of interest, at the visit closest to 90 days postoperative.A matched data set from 100 WFO and 97 PAE eyes was extracted from clinical records. At the postoperative visit the PAE group showed lower residual refractive cylinder (p = 0.04), uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) (-0.06 PAE vs. -0.02 WFO, p < 0.01) and distance corrected visual acuity (CDVA) (p < 0.01). The percentage of eyes with a mean refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) magnitude within 0.25 D and 0.50 D of plano was statistically significantly higher in the PAE group (p = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). A statistically significantly higher percentage of eyes in the PAE group had UDVA better than or equal to -0.10 logMAR (20/16 Snellen, 36% vs 22%, p = 0.04). More eyes gained CDVA after surgery in the PAE group (53% vs 32%, p < 0.01). There were five enhancements in the WFO group versus none in the PAE group, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.03).Visual acuity and refractive outcomes after LASIK using PAE in eyes with oblique astigmatism in their preoperative refraction were statistically significantly better than those obtained when WFO treatment was used. The number of refractive outliers and the number of retreatments were also significantly lower with PAE treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4311914530,"Objectives In this in-vitro study, teeth were imaged using photoacoustic tomography (PAT), cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), and micro-computed tomography (μ-CT). The study had aim: to identify the best wavelength for PAT images to determine the accuracy of the three imaging methods, and to determine whether PAT images of teeth can achieve acceptable reconstruction quality. Methods Nineteen human mandibular single-rooted incisors were extracted from patients with trauma or periodontitis. To determine the best wavelength for acquiring photoacoustic images, all 19 teeth were scanned in vitro with PAT, using different laser wavelengths between 680 and 960 nm. The images were analyzed using image analysis software. To assess the accuracy of PAT and compare it with the accuracy of CBCT, each tooth was also scanned in vitro using CBCT and the reference standard technique of μ-CT. Subsequently, three different three-dimensional models, one for each imaging technique, were created for each tooth. Finally, the three different three-dimensional models acquired for the same tooth were matched and analyzed regarding volume and surface. Results The highest quality tooth images were achieved using the 680 nm wavelength, which showed the best contrast ratio. The full geometry of the dental root (μ-CT compared with PAT) could be visualized with relative standard deviations of 0.12 mm for the surface and −7.33 mm 3 for the volume (n = 19). The full geometry of the dental root (μ-CT compared with CBCT) could be visualized with relative standard deviations of 0.06 mm for the surface and −14.56 mm 3 for the volume (n = 19). The difference between the PAT–μ-CT group and CBCT–μ-CT group regarding the total average of the root surface area was not significant (p&gt;0.06). Conclusion Images, which were acquired using PAT at 680nm showed the best contrast ration, enabling the identification of dentin, cementum and the dental pulp. No significant differences were found between the PAT–μ-CT group and CBCT–μ-CT group regarding the total average of the RSA and the total volume. Thus, three-dimensional reconstructions based on in-vitro PAT are already of acceptable reconstruction quality."
https://openalex.org/W4311942413,"The removal of leukocytes from blood components helps to prevent or reduce some adverse reactions that occur after blood transfusions. The implementation of the leukodepletion process in the preparation of blood units requires quality control, consisting of a reliable cell counting method to determine residual leukocytes in blood components. The most widely used methodology is a flow cytometric bead-based counting method. To avoid the need for commercial counting beads, we evaluated a volumetric counting method of leukocyte enumeration. A total of 160 specimens of leukodepleted plasma, red cell and platelet units, as well as 58 samples of commercially available controls containing different concentration levels of leukocytes, were included in the study. The conventional quality control method using the bead-based counting method performed with the FACSCalibur flow cytometer was compared to the bead-based counting method and the volumetric counting method performed with the MACSQuant 10 flow cytometer. Our results show that the MACSQuant bead-based method, as well as the volumetric MACSQuant method, meet the sensitivity requirements of residual leukocyte enumeration when compared to the gold standard, bead-based FACSCalibur method. We conclude that the volumetric method can be a substitute for the bead-based counting of residual leukocytes in a variety of blood components."

However, this association remains uncertain because published studies have had small sample sizes and variability in chronic comorbidity adjustment.In this retrospective cohort study conducted at a multihospital health system, we compared COVID-19 outcomes and survival up to 60 days following hospital admission in SOT recipients taking baseline immunosuppressants versus hospitalized control patients.The study included 4,562 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 (108 SOT recipients and 4,454 controls) from 03/2020 to 08/2020. Mortality at 60 days was higher for SOT recipients (17% SOT vs 10% control; unadjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-2.91, P = 0.04). We then conducted a 1:5 propensity matched cohort analysis (100 SOT recipients; 500 controls) using age, sex, race, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, admission month, and area deprivation index. Within 28 days of admission, SOT recipients had fewer hospital-free days (median; 17 SOT vs 21 control; OR = 0.64, 95%CI 0.46-0.90, P = 0.01) but had similar ICU-free days (OR = 1.20, 95%CI 0.72-2.00, P = 0.49) and ventilator-free days (OR = 0.91, 95%CI 0.53-1.57, P = 0.75). There was no statistically significant difference in 28-day mortality (9% SOT vs 12% control; OR = 0.76, 95%CI 0.36-1.57, P = 0.46) or 60-day mortality (16% SOT vs 14% control; OR = 1.15, 95%CI 0.64-2.08, P = 0.64).Hospitalized SOT recipients appear to need additional days of hospital care but can achieve short-term mortality outcomes from COVID-19 that are similar to non-SOT recipients in a propensity matched cohort study."
https://openalex.org/W4311942941,"A quantitative monitoring system for fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) in homes is very important for the control of respiratory diseases such as asthma. To this end, this paper proposes a small bionic sensing system for NO detection in an electronic nose based on analysis of the structure of the canine olfactory system and the airflow pattern in the nasal cavity. The proposed system detected NO at different FENO concentration levels with different bionic sensing systems in the electronic nose, and analyzed the data comparatively. Combined with a backpropagation neural network algorithm, the bionic canine sensing system improved the recognition rate for FENO detection by up to 98.1%. Moreover, electronic noses with a canine bionic sensing system can improve the performance of trace gas detection."
https://openalex.org/W4311456158,"Collagen triple helices are critical in the function of mannan-binding lectin (MBL), an oligomeric recognition molecule in complement activation. The MBL collagen regions form complexes with the serine proteases MASP-1 and MASP-2 in order to activate complement, and mutations lead to common immunodeficiencies. To evaluate their structure-function properties, we studied the solution structures of four MBL-like collagen peptides. The thermal stability of the MBL collagen region was much reduced by the presence of a GQG interruption in the typical (X-Y-Gly)n repeat compared to controls. Experimental solution structural data were collected using analytical ultracentrifugation and small angle X-ray and neutron scattering. As controls, we included two standard Pro-Hyp-Gly collagen peptides (POG)10-13, as well as three more peptides with diverse (X-Y-Gly)n sequences that represented other collagen features. These data were quantitatively compared with atomistic linear collagen models derived from crystal structures and 12,000 conformations obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. All four MBL peptides were bent to varying degrees up to 85o in the best-fit molecular dynamics models. The best-fit benchmark peptides (POG)n were more linear but exhibited a degree of conformational flexibility. The remaining three peptides showed mostly linear solution structures. In conclusion, the collagen helix is not strictly linear, the degree of flexibility in the triple helix depends on its sequence, and the triple helix with the GQG interruption showed a pronounced bend. The bend in MBL GQG peptides resembles the bend in the collagen of complement C1q and may be key for lectin pathway activation."
https://openalex.org/W4311775285,"EmrE, a small multidrug resistance transporter from Escherichia coli, confers broad-spectrum resistance to polyaromatic cations and quaternary ammonium compounds. Previous transport assays demonstrate that EmrE transports a +1 and a +2 substrate with the same stoichiometry of two protons:one cationic substrate. This suggests that EmrE substrate binding capacity is limited to neutralization of the two essential glutamates, E14A and E14B (one from each subunit in the antiparallel homodimer), in the primary binding site. Here, we explicitly test this hypothesis, since EmrE has repeatedly broken expectations for membrane protein structure and transport mechanism. We previously showed that EmrE can bind a +1 cationic substrate and proton simultaneously, with cationic substrate strongly associated with one E14 residue, whereas the other remains accessible to bind and transport a proton. Here, we demonstrate that EmrE can bind a +2 cation substrate and a proton simultaneously using NMR pH titrations of EmrE saturated with divalent substrates, for a net +1 charge in the transport pore. Furthermore, we find that EmrE can alternate access and transport a +2 substrate and proton at the same time. Together, these results lead us to conclude that E14 charge neutralization does not limit the binding and transport capacity of EmrE."
https://openalex.org/W4311911875,"Motor competence (MC) as a multidimensional construct is influenced by motor, cognitive, emotional and social variables. It is also determined by schoolchildren interacting with their own context. Thus pre-adolescence is a sensitive stage in development when physical, emotional and cognitive changes are manifested. By taking this context in accountn, the perception of the social referents close to schoolchildren allows for a deeper understanding of the role and influence of all these variables in a broader MC concept. For this purpose, a qualitative study was conducted by discussion groups and semistructured interviews, respectively, for teachers and family members in Primary Education. The content analysis was carried out according to the main study dimensions, associated with the motor, cognitive, affective-emotional and social domains. Both family members and teachers point out that the affective-emotional level has a stronger impact on the development of motor skills than the motor level. For children to develop their MC, it is necessary to create appropriate contexts in which family members and teachers are the main agents of influence. In conclusion, assessing MC in the educational sphere must have a more comprehensive and broad approach. It is necessary to bear in mind a larger number of variables involved in schoolchildren’s motor development to make the most objective assessment possible and, likewise, to promote facilitating environments that help their development."
https://openalex.org/W4311911977,"Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) can cause colibacillosis in poultry, characterised by localised or systemic infections. Colibacillosis is considered one of the leading causes of economic losses in the poultry industry due to reduced performance, increased mortality, treatment costs and carcass condemnations. A live attenuated Escherichia coli O78 aroA gene mutant is widely used to prevent disease. However, no effective strategies to differentiate the vaccine strain from field strains are available, hampering follow-up of vaccination campaigns. In the current study, we report a PCR-based method to simultaneously detect the vaccine strain by targeting the vaccine-specific mutation in the aroA gene, as well as the wild type E. coli strains by targeting the xanQ gene. The specificity of this PCR was evaluated using 123 E. coli isolates, form which 5 WT aroA auxotrophic strains (WT strains with a natural aroA deficiency), as well as 7 non-Escherichia isolates. The PCR showed 100% sensitivity of the xanQ primers for E. coli detection and 100% sensitivity of the ΔaroA primers for the vaccine strain. In order to allow quantification of the vaccine strain in complex samples containing many different E. coli strains and other related organisms, such as chicken faeces, a probe-based duplex qPCR was developed. The limit of detection (LOD) of this duplex qPCR method was 8.4*103 copies/g faeces. The specificity of the duplex qPCR was confirmed by determining both the vaccine strain levels, and the total E. coli load in intestinal digesta from both vaccinated and non-vaccinated birds. E. coli could be detected in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated birds. The duplex qPCR was specific for the vaccine strain as this strain was detected in all vaccinated birds, whereas no signal was detected in non-vaccinated birds. The duplex qPCR is helpful in monitoring colonization and shedding of the vaccine strain."
https://openalex.org/W4311914141,"Beef exports represent a substantial part of Paraguay’s agricultural sector. Cattle movements involve a high risk due to the possible spread of bovine diseases that can have a significant impact on the country’s economy. We analyzed cattle movements from 2014 to 2018 using the networks analysis methodology at the holding and district levels at different temporal scales. We built two types of networks to identify network characteristics that may contribute to the spread of two diseases with different epidemiological characteristics: i) a network including all cattle movements to consider the transmission of a disease of rapid spread like foot and mouth disease, and ii) a network including only cow movements to account for bovine brucellosis, a disease of slow spread that occurs mainly in adult females. Network indicators did not vary substantially among the cattle and cow only networks. The holdings/districts included in the largest strongly connected components were distributed throughout the country. Percolation analysis performed at the holding level showed that a large number of holdings should be removed to make the largest strongly connected component disappear. Higher values of the centrality indicators were found for markets than for farms, indicating that they may play an important role in the spread of an infectious disease. At the holding level (but not at the district level), the networks exhibited characteristics of small-world networks. This property may facilitate the spread of foot and mouth disease in case of re-emergence, or of bovine brucellosis in the country through cattle movements. They should be taken into account when implementing surveillance or control measures for these diseases."

To address this objective, we use data from the Alberta's Tomorrow Project of 18,288 women to train Individual Survival Distribution (ISD) models to predict an individual's Breast-Cancer-Onset (BCaO) probability curve. We show that our three-step approach-(1) filling missing data with multiple imputations by chained equations, followed by (2) feature selection with the multivariate Cox method, and finally, (3) using MTLR to learn an ISD model-produced the model with the smallest L1-Hinge loss among all calibrated models with comparable C-index. We also identified 7 actionable lifestyle features that a woman can modify and illustrate how this model can predict the quantitative effects of those changes-suggesting how much each will potentially extend her BCa-free time. We anticipate this approach could be used to identify appropriate interventions for individuals with a higher likelihood of developing BCa in their lifetime."
https://openalex.org/W4311914238,"Background This study aimed to investigate the association between the carotid ultrasound results and 1-yr mortality of patients with neurological deficits in the emergency department (ED). Methods This study included patients with neurological symptoms who presented to the ED between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018, and underwent sonographic imaging of the bilateral carotid bulb, common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and external carotid arteries. A stenosis degree of &gt;50% was defined as significant carotid stenosis. Carotid plaque score (CPS) was calculated by adding the score of stenosis severity of all segments. The association between carotid ultrasound results and 1-yr mortality was investigated using the Cox regression model. Results The analysis included 7,961 patients (median age: 69 yr; men: 58.7%). Among them, 247 (3.1%) passed away from cardiovascular (CV)-related causes, and 746 (9.4%) died within a year. The mortality group presented with more significant carotid stenosis of the carotid bulb, CCA, or ICA and had a higher median CPS. A higher CPS was associated with a greater 1-yr all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03–1.13; p = 0.001; log-rank p &lt; 0.001) and CV-related mortality (aHR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.04–1.22; p = 0.002, log-rank p &lt; 0.001). Significant stenosis of either carotid artery segment did not result in a higher risk of 1-yr mortality. Conclusions We comprehensively investigated the utility of carotid ultrasound parameters on predicting mortality in this 10-yr population-based cohort, which included over 7,000 patients with acute neurological deficits presented to the ED. The result showed that CPS could be used as risk stratification tools for 1-yr all-cause and CV mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4311914239,"Structural barriers such as inadequate housing, lack of employment opportunities, and discrimination are known to adversely affect the health of newly settled refugee migrants. However, these barriers remain largely unresolved and unaddressed. Thus, there is a need to better understand how other factors, such as individual-level health resources, may influence health and mitigate ill health in the early post-migration phase. In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between health outcomes and individual health resources including health literacy, social support, and self-efficacy in newly settled refugee migrants. Survey data was collected from 787 refugee migrants in Sweden. Logistical regression analysis showed that limited health literacy, lack of emotional support, and low self-efficacy were consistently associated with poor health outcomes. Demographic variables such as gender, education, and type of residence permit were not as imperative. Individual-level health resources may play an important role in the general and psychological well-being of newly settled migrants. Promoting health literacy and facilitating the attainment of social support may buffer for structural challenges in the establishment phase and enhance the prospects of later health and social integration."

Because of its clinical phenotypes and the bone marrow morphology associated with this condition, hereditary thrombocytopenia can be misdiagnosed as primary immune thrombocytopenia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Therefore, genetic evidence is necessary for the accurate diagnosis of hereditary thrombocytopenia. Refractory cytopenia of childhood is a subgroup of myelodysplastic syndrome that was added to the World Health Organization classification in 2008. To investigate the germline and somatic variants associated with refractory cytopenia of childhood, we performed targeted multigene sequencing in three patients with refractory cytopenia of childhood. Of the three patients, one progressed from megakaryocytic hypoplasia with thrombocytopenia, and targeted multigene sequencing revealed THPO variants in this patient and his sister.

https://openalex.org/W4311914328,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a threat to human beings and numerous cases of infection as well as millions of victims have been reported. The binding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is known to promote the engulfment of the virus by host cells. Employment of flavor/fragrance compositions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting the binding of viral RBD (vRBD) to hACE2 might serve as a favorable, simple, and easy method for inexpensively preventing COVID-19, as flavor/fragrance compositions are known to directly interact with the mucosa in the respiratory and digestive systems and have a long history of use and safety assessment. Herein we report the results of screening of flavor/fragrance compositions that inhibit the binding of vRBD to hACE2. We found that the inhibitory effect was observed with not only the conventional vRBD, but also variant vRBDs, such as L452R, E484K, and N501Y single-residue variants, and the K417N+E484K+N501Y triple-residue variant. Most of the examined flavor/fragrance compositions are not known to have anti-viral effects. Cinnamyl alcohol and Helional inhibited the binding of vRBD to VeroE6 cells, a monkey kidney cell line expressing ACE2. We termed the composition with inhibitory effect on vRBD-hACE2 binding as ""the molecularly targeted flavor/fragrance compositions"". COVID-19 development could be prevented by using these compositions with reasonable administration methods such as inhalation, oral administration, and epidermal application."
https://openalex.org/W4311914379,"COVID-19 arrived in the United States in early 2020, with cases quickly being reported in many states including Pennsylvania. Many statistical models have been proposed to understand the trends of the COVID-19 pandemic and factors associated with increasing cases. While Poisson regression is a natural choice to model case counts, this approach fails to account for correlation due to spatial locations. Being a contagious disease and often spreading through community infections, the number of COVID-19 cases are inevitably spatially correlated as locations neighboring counties with a high COVID-19 case count are more likely to have a high case count. In this analysis, we combine generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for Poisson regression, a popular method for analyzing correlated data, with a semivariogram to model daily COVID-19 case counts in 67 Pennsylvania counties between March 20, 2020 to January 23, 2021 in order to study infection dynamics during the beginning of the pandemic. We use a semivariogram that describes the spatial correlation as a function of the distance between two counties as the working correlation. We further incorporate a zero-inflated model in our spatial GEE to accommodate excess zeros in reported cases due to logistical challenges associated with disease monitoring. By modeling time-varying holiday covariates, we estimated the effect of holiday timing on case count. Our analysis showed that the incidence rate ratio was significantly greater than one, 6-8 days after a holiday suggesting a surge in COVID-19 cases approximately one week after a holiday."

We used an epiphytic bio-indicator (moss genus: Orthotrichum) to cost-effectively evaluate atmospheric deposition of PAHs in Portland, Oregon in May 2013. However, it is unclear if measurements derived from these bioindicators are good proxies for human exposure. To address this question, we simultaneously, measured PAH-DNA adducts in blood samples of non-smokers residing close to the sites of moss measurements. We accounted for individual determinants of PAH uptake that are not related to environmental air quality through questionnaires, e.g., wood fires, consumption of barbecued and fried meats. Spearman rank correlation and linear regression (to control for confounders from the lifestyle factors) evaluated the associations. We did not observe evidence of an association between PAH levels in moss and PAH-DNA adducts in blood of nearby residents (e.g., all correlations p≥0.5), but higher level of adducts were evident in those who used wood fire in their houses in the last 48 hours. It remains to be determined whether bio-indicators in moss can be used for human health risk assessment."

We aimed to assess the migration of Central Venous Catheter (CVC) position, as a significant movement of catheter tip location may challenge some of the daily practice after insertion. Design and settings Retrospective, single-center study, conducted in the Intensive Care and Cardiovascular Intensive Care Units in Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center ’Ichilov’, Israel, between January and June 2019. Patients We identified 101 patients with a CVC in the Right Internal Jugular (RIJ) with at least two CXRs during hospitalization. Measurements and results For each patient, we measured the CVC tip position below the carina level in the first and all consecutive CXRs. The average initial tip position was 1.52 (±1.9) cm (mean±SD) below the carina. The maximal migration distance from the initial insertion position was 1.9 (±1) cm (mean±SD). During follow-up of 2 to 5 days, 92% of all subject’s CVCs remained within the range of the Superior Vena Cava to the top of the right atrium, regardless of the initial positioning. Conclusions CVC tip position can migrate significantly during a patient’s early hospitalization period regardless of primary location, although for most patients it will remain within a wide range of the top of the right atrium and the middle of the Superior Vena Cava (SVC), if accepted as well-positioned."
https://openalex.org/W4311942526,"In March 2020, Ohio, along with many other states, enacted a stay-at-home order (i.e., “shutdown”) to limit the spread of COVID-19. As a result of lower traffic, crashes should also have declined. We investigated whether crash rates declined in Ohio during the stay-at-home order and explore possible predictors for the decrease, such as reduced travel in compliance with the order, along with speeding, alcohol, and drug use. In addition, we examined whether support for President Trump would relate to greater travel and greater crashes (particularly during the stay-at-home order, when greater travel indicated lower compliance). The overall rate of crashes fell as people stayed home, mainly due to a decline in minor crashes. In contrast, the rate of serious crashes did not fall. Instead, percentage of alcohol-related crashes increased during the stay-at-home order, and the reduction in travel was associated with greater speeding-related crashes. Because alcohol and speeding tend to increase crash severity, these two factors may explain why severe crash rates were not reduced by lower traffic. Instead, it appears that those drivers remaining on the roads during the shutdown may have been more prone to risky behaviors, evidenced by a greater percentage of alcohol-related crashes across the state during the shutdown and greater speed-related crashes in counties with less traffic. In addition, county-level support for President Trump indirectly predicted greater rates of crashes (of all types) via increased travel (i.e., lower compliance with the shutdown), even while controlling for county-level income, rurality, and Appalachian region. Importantly, this mediated effect was stronger during the weeks of the shutdown, when greater travel indicated lower compliance. Thus, lower compliance with the stay-at-home order and increased risky driving behaviors by remaining drivers may explain why lower traffic did not lead to lower serious crashes."
https://openalex.org/W4311942692,"Background Due to interactions with variety of environmental and physicochemical factors, the composition and diversity of bacteria and fungi in manure ectopic fermentation are constantly changing. The purpose of this study was to investigated bacterial and fungal changes in dairy manure ectopic fermentation, as well as the relationships between keystone species and physicochemical characteristics. Methods Ectopic fermentation was carried out for 93 days using mattress materials, which was combined with rice husk and rice chaff (6:4, v/v), and dairy waste mixed with manure and sewage. Physicochemical characteristics (moisture content, pH, NH4+-N (NN), total organic carbon (TO), total nitrogen (TN) and the C/N ratio) of ectopic fermentation samples were measured, as well as enzymatic activity (cellulose, urease, dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase). Furthermore, the bacterial and fungal communities were studied using 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequencing, as well as network properties and keystone species were analyzed. Results During the ectopic fermentation, the main pathogenic bacteria reduced while fecal coliform increased. The C/N ratio gradually decreased, whereas cellulase and dehydrogenase remained at lower levels beyond day 65, indicating fermentation maturity and stability. During fermentation, the dominant phyla were Chloroflexi , Firmicutes , Proteobacteria , Bacteroidetes , and Actinobacteria of bacteria, and Ascomycota of fungi, while bacterial and fungal community diversity changed dramatically and inversely. The association between physicochemical characteristics and community keystone taxon was examined, and C/N ratio was negative associated to keystone genus. Conclusion These data indicated that microbial composition and diversity interacted with fermentation environment and parameters, while regulation of keystone species management of physicochemical factors might lead to improved maturation rate and quality during dairy manure ectopic fermentation. These findings provide a reference to enhance the quality and efficiency of waste management on dairy farm."

To assess the contribution of mtDNA haplogroups to the predisposition of MS in an Arab population, we analysed sequencing data of mitochondrial genomes from 47 native Saudi Arab individuals including 23 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 24 healthy controls. All patients and controls could be classified into ten haplogroups. The European-specific haplogroup U was more prevalent in patients than in the controls (26.1% vs. 4.2%), whereas haplogroup T was only present in patients and haplogroups HV and N were only found in controls. Haplogroup U was significantly association with increased risk of MS (odds ratio = 6.26, p<0.05), although the association did not maintain significance after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Haplotype U was more prevalent in patients with younger age of onset (p = 0.006), but there was no relationship between haplotype U and disease severity, disease duration or EDSS and age-matched carriers and non-carriers of haplogroup U (p>0.05). Definition site of haplogroup U include the variant m.12308A>G in MT-TL2 gene which was found to affect highly conserved position within the variable arm of tRNALeu(CUN) and thus may impact mitochondrial protein synthesis, and two other variants namely m.11467A>G in MT-ND4 gene and m.12372G>A in MT-ND5 gene which were previously linked with mitochondrial function. Despite the small number of subjects, which may limit the statistical power of the study, our results showed for the first time a possible contribution of haplogroup U to the predisposition to MS in an Arab population. These findings warrant further validation in a large cohort to distinguish a genuine effect specific to MS from a chance finding due to small sampling."

Hence, we aimed to prospectively investigate the dysregulated genes, pathways and networks involved in HN by performing whole transcriptome sequencing using RNA sequencing. Six kidney samples from HN group (n = 3) and a control group (n = 3) were obtained to conduct RNA sequencing. To disclose the relevant signalling pathways, we conducted the analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. A competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was established to reveal the interactions between lncRNAs, circRNAs, mRNAs and miRNAs and investigate the potential mechanisms of HN. Ultimately, 2250 mRNAs, 306 lncRNAs, 5 circRNAs, and 70 miRNAs were determined to be significantly differentially expressed in the HN group relative to the control group. We further authenticated 8 differentially expressed (DE)-ncRNAs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and these findings were in accordance with the sequencing results. The analysis results evidently showed that these DE-ncRNAs were significantly enriched in pathways related to inflammatory reaction. In conclusion, HUA may generate abnormal gene expression changes and regulate signalling pathways in kidney samples. Potentially related genes and pathways involved in HN were identified."
