https://openalex.org/W2057077134,"Rising mean sea level, it is proposed, is a significant indicator of global climate change. The principal factors that can have contributed to the observed increases of global mean sea level in recent decades are thermal expansion of the oceans and the discharge of polar ice sheets. Calculations indicate that thermal expansion cannot be the sole factor responsible for the observed rise in sea level over the last 40 years; significant discharges of polar ice must also be occurring. Global warming, due in some degree presumably to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, has been opposed by the extraction of heat necessary to melt the discharged ice. During the past 40 years more than 50,000 cubic kilometers of ice has been discharged and has melted, reducing the surface warming that might otherwise have occurred by as much as a factor of 2. The transfer of mass from the polar regions to a thin spherical shell covering all the oceans should have increased the earth's moment of inertia and correspondingly reduced the speed of rotation by about 1.5 parts in 10(8). This accounts for about three quarters of the observed fractional reduction in the earth's angular velocity since 1940. Monitoring of global mean sea level, ocean surface temperatures, and the earth's speed of rotation should be complemented by monitoring of the polar ice sheets, as is now possible by satellite altimetry. All parts of the puzzle need to be examined in order that a consistent picture emerge."
https://openalex.org/W1976889885,"Steady-state turnover times for simultaneous photosynthetic production of hydrogen and oxygen have been measured for two systems: the in vitro system comprised of isolated chloroplasts, ferredoxin, and hydrogenase, and the anaerobically adapted green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [137c(+) mating type]. In both systems, the simultaneous photoproduction of hydrogen and oxygen was measured by driving the systems into the steady state with repetitive, single-turnover, flash illumination. The turnover times for production of both oxygen and hydrogen in photosynthetic water splitting are in milliseconds and are equal to or less than the turnover time for carbon dioxide reduction in intact algal cells. The oxygen and hydrogen turnover times are therefore compatible with each other and partially compatible with the excitation rate of the photosynthetic reaction centers under conditions of solar irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2029025915,"Exsolution lamellae are abundant in coexisting hornblende and cummingtonite, and in hornblende coexisting with anthophyllite in Ordovician volcanics metamorphosed in the kyanite and sillimanite zones in central Massachusetts and adjacent New Hampshire. The lamellae have the same orientation relative to the internal structure as the (100) and (001) exsolution lamellae in clinopyroxenes, but are indexed (100) and (ī01) with the C2/m space group commonly chosen for amphiboles. Specimens from the kyanite zone contain very thin (100) and (ī01) lamellae. In the sillimanite zone, both (100) and (ī01) lamellae are thicker and more abundant in iron-rich specimens than they are in magnesian specimens, as might be expected by analogy with pyroxenes from layered mafic intrusions. The (ī01 lamellae allow correct determination of the relations between the optic vibration directions and the crystallographic axes for two alternatively selected space group C2/m and I2/m. This evidence shows that there has been much confusion concerning these relations."
https://openalex.org/W1971068233,The 12 Virginia barrier islands are divided into three groups on the basis of historical retreat rates and characteristics. The growth and reversal of inlet offsets is a long-term event that results from the operation of known coastal processes. Both geomorphic evidence and wave refraction analyses indicate that shoreline irregularity will diminish with time. There is no basis for the prediction (or expectation) that cape-like features will evolve along this shoreline.

https://openalex.org/W2058336525,"The 24 May 1981 close approach of Neptune to an uncataloged star was photoelectrically monitored from two observatories separated by 6 kilometers parallel to the occultation track. An 8.1-second drop in signal, recorded simultaneously at both sites, is interpreted as resulting from the passage of a third satellite of Neptune in front of the star. From the duration of the event, the derived minimum diameter for an object sharing Neptune's motion is 180 kilometers. If the object was in Neptune's equatorial plane and there are no significant errors in the prediction ephemeris, the object was located at a distance of 3 Neptune radii from Neptune's center."

https://openalex.org/W2012974549,"The pulse structure of the four known pulsars is given. The pulse is about 38 milliseconds for the two pulsars of longest period, and within the pulsewidth three subpulses typically appear. The pulsar of next longest period typically radiates two pulses separated about 23 milliseconds in time. The one short-period pulsar emits single pulses of constant shape. The first subpulses of all pulsars have nearly the same shape. The shape of the first subpulse agrees well with the pulse shape expected from a radio-emitting sphere which is excited by a spherically expanding disturbance, and in which the radio emission, once excited, decays exponentially."
https://openalex.org/W1979187362,"A variety of recent optical, radio, and x-ray observation have confirmed the hypothesis that the peculiar star SS 433 is ejecting two narrow, opposed, highly collimated jets of matter at one-quarter the speed of light. This unique behavior is probably driven by mass exchange between a relatively normal star and a compact companion, either a neutron star or a black hole. However, numerous details regarding the energetics, radiation, acceleration, and collimation of the jets remain to be understood. This phenomenon may well be a miniature example of similar collimated ejection of gas by active extragalactic objects such as quasars and radio galaxies."

https://openalex.org/W2054092232,"There is increasing interest in the possible existence of large eddies or ""Rossby waves"" in Sun's convection zone and photosphere. It is shown that many flows of this type, driven by an equator-pole temperature diffrence, act as hydromagnetic dynamos to produce magnetic fields that periodically reverse. The periods and field amplitudes agree with solar phenomena within an order of magnitude."
https://openalex.org/W1999187926,Analysis of the relation between time delay and frequency for pulses from Pulsar 1 shows that the dispersive region of the ray path must exceed 300 astronomical units and have an average electron number density less than 8000 per cubic centimeter and average magnetic field strength less than 2 x 10(-3) gauss. These requirements almost guarantee that the observed dispersion takes place in the interstellar medium.
https://openalex.org/W4250987958,"Maya beginnings go back at least 4000 years in southern Mexico and Central America. The Maya of the tropical lowlands were one of several linguistically distinct groups who occupied pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Their complex social order and civilization, which arose from early village farming, encompassed remarkable achievements in architecture, the arts, and hieroglyphic writing. Their Classic civilization (A.D. 250 to 1000) was a tightly integrated system in which subsistence, technology, settlement, the arts, and ideology closely intermeshed. Their decline and the subsequent Postclassic Period (A.D. 1000 to .1520), the continuing subjects of debate among Mayanists, are perhaps best understood in the light of more widespread Mesoamerican trends and changes."

Maximum expansion Z(2) at time t(2) after the start of mixing are dependent variables related to the diameter Z(1) of propeller or mixer and to the Väisälä-Brunt period T by T/t(2) = 2.5 and Z(2)t(2)/Z(1)T = 1.3. These scaling relations are first-order approximations."

https://openalex.org/W2059327893,"The final report of the National Research Council's (NRC is the contact arm of the National Academy of Sciences) final report of the diesel impacts study committee concludes that the government's goal for diesel engines in 1985 is too ambitious and should be stopped. The National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) challenged the report as it omits mention of promising developments in diesel technology in 1981 (data collection for the study ceased in August 1980). The report says that while GM and other manufacturers could produce lightweight diesel cars, it will be difficult to make large family cars over 2000 pounds. GM estimates that the number of diesel cars sold per year will grow from four to 25% by 1990. Since the diesel engine omits 30 to 100 times more particulate matter than an equivalent gasoline engine, pollution could be a major health concern. However, the report finds, the risks are not well enough defined to justify the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 1985 standard of 0.2 gram of particulates per mile. EPA should keep the present standard and review it every three years. The NRDC, however, claims that the NRC study is one and a half years out-of-date and that technology for controlling diesel emissions has greatly advanced since then."
