https://openalex.org/W2082670705,"Two cDNAs were isolated whose dimerized products bind specifically to a DNA sequence, kappa E2, located in the immunoglobulin kappa chain enhancer. Both cDNAs share a region of extensive identity to the Drosophila daughterless gene and obvious similarity to a segment in three myc proteins, MyoD, and members of the Drosophila achaete-scute and twist gene family. The homologous regions have the potential to form two amphipathic helices separated by an intervening loop. Remarkable is the stringent conservation of hydrophobic residues present in both helices. We demonstrate that this new motif plays a crucial role in both dimerization and DNA binding."

https://openalex.org/W2031611773,"The doublesex (dsx) gene regulates somatic sexual differentiation in both sexes in D. melanogaster. Two functional products are encoded by dsx: one product is expressed in females and represses male differentiation, and the other is expressed in males and represses female differentiation. We have determined that the dsx gene is transcribed to produce a common primary transcript that is alternatively spliced and polyadenylated to yield male- and female-specific mRNAs. These sex-specific mRNAs share a common 5' end and three common exons, but possess alternative sex-specific 3' exons, thus encoding polypeptides with a common amino-terminal sequence but sex-specific carboxyl termini. Genetic and molecular data suggest that sequences including and adjacent to the female-specific splice acceptor site play an important role in the regulation of dsx expression by the transformer and transformer-2 loci."
https://openalex.org/W2080184511,"Rapid induction of c-fos transcription by serum and phorbol esters requires the serum response element (SRE). The SRE contains a 20 bp element of interrupted dyad symmetry (DSE) that is bound by p67/SRF. We have identified a hitherto unrecognized protein with an apparent size of 62 kd. This novel component, p62, is shown to be an integral but physically separable part of a ternary complex formed with p67/SRF and the SRE. Alone, p62 fails to bind the SRE but requires DSE-bound p67/SRF and sequences both within and outside the DSE for its interaction with DNA. In vivo, the response of the c-fos promoter to serum is severely impaired by mutations that abolish ternary complex formation in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1507228972,"Abstract alpha-Adrenergic (phenylephrine) and muscarinic (carbachol) agonists and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate caused calcium release and contractions in smooth muscle strips permeabilized with Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin. The responses to phenylephrine and carbachol required or were potentiated by added GTP and could be inhibited by GDP beta S. GTP and phenylephrine also increased the contractile response of permeabilized portal vein smooth muscle to cytoplasmic Ca2+. We conclude that while the G-protein-coupled phosphatidylinositol cascade, through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release, is a major mechanism of pharmacomechanical coupling, a second G-protein-mediated pathway that modulates the calcium sensitivity of the regulatory contractile proteins also exists."

https://openalex.org/W1970930847,"Mutant flies in which the gene coding for the Shaker potassium channel is deleted still have potassium currents similar to those coded by the Shaker gene. This suggests the presence of a family of Shaker-like genes in Drosophila. By using a Shaker complementary DNA probe and low-stringency hybridization, three additional family members have now been isolated, Shab, Shaw, and Shal. The Shaker family genes are not clustered in the genome. The deduced proteins of Shab, Shaw, and Shal have high homology to the Shaker protein; the sequence identity of the integral membrane portions is greater than 50 percent. These genes are organized similarly to Shaker in that only a single homology domain containing six presumed membrane-spanning segments common to all voltage-gated ion channels is coded by each messenger RNA. Thus, potassium channel diversity could result from an extended gene family, as well as from alternate splicing of the Shaker primary transcript."

https://openalex.org/W2035595923,"The torpedo gene of Drosophila melanogaster is involved in the establishment of the dorsoventral pattern of eggshell and embryo. We have isolated new alleles of torpedo and have found that torpedo is allelic to the zygotic embryonic lethal faint little ball. We have shown that torpedo resides in subdivision 57F on the second chromosome--at the same location as the Drosophila homolog of the EGF receptor (DER). Using a cosmid that contains most of the DER coding region as a hybridization probe, we have shown that a cytologically small deficiency that eliminates torpedo activity also removes the DER gene, and that an inversion that was isolated as a strong torpedo allele breaks the coding region of the DER gene. We conclude that torpedo is the DER gene."

https://openalex.org/W1585449429,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a glycerophospholipid that has diverse potent biological actions. A plasma enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 acetoyl group of PAF and thereby abolishes its bioactivity. This PAF acetylhydrolase is specific for phospholipids, such as PAF, with a short acyl group at the sn-2 position. The majority of it (60-70%) is associated with low density lipoprotein (LDL), and the remainder is with high density lipoprotein (HDL). LDL also has a phospholipase A2 activity that is specific for oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids, which may be important in determining how LDL is recognized by cellular receptors. We previously have purified and characterized the PAF acetylhydrolase from human plasma. We now have found that the purified PAF acetylhydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the oxidized fragments of arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine. One of the preferred substrates appeared by mass spectrometry to have 5-oxovalerate at the sn-2 position. We synthesized 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and found that the PAF acetylhydrolase had the same apparent Km for it (11.3 microM) as for PAF (12.5 microM), with Vmax values of 100 and 167 mumol/h/mg of protein, respectively. We also conclude that the PAF acetylhydrolase is the sole activity in LDL that degrades oxidized phospholipids since we found co-localization of the activity against both substrates to LDL and HDL, and precipitation of enzyme activity with an antibody to the PAF acetylhydrolase. Thus, the PAF acetylhydrolase in human plasma degrades oxidized phospholipids, which may be involved in the modification of apolipoprotein B100 and other pathological processes."
https://openalex.org/W80696700,"Abstract We prepared and isolated defined, reconstituted high density lipoprotein (r-HDL) particles containing apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol. The initial r-HDL were prepared by the sodium cholate method, then part of the preparation was depleted of phospholipid by exposure to LDL, and the resulting, stable r-HDL species were isolated by gel filtration. The isolated r-HDL were characterized in terms of their size, alpha-helix content, and the conformation of apoA-I as reported by the fluorescence properties of the tryptophan residues. Then the relative reactivity of the r-HDL with lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase was assessed. The isolated, discoidal r-HDL contained 2 and 3 apoA-I molecules/particle, and had 77 and 109 A diameters, respectively. Their spectral properties were essentially identical and were distinct from the larger particles in the class of r-HDL with 2 apoA-I molecules/particle (particles with diameters of 86 and 96 A). In addition, the reactivity of the 77 and 109 A particles with pure lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase was similar and about 10-fold lower than for the 86 and 96 A particles. We conclude that the stable, limiting r-HDL particles in each class (77 and 109 A) can arise from the larger particles of the same class by depletion of phospholipids. These limiting particles have very similar apoA-I conformations, with decreased alpha-helix contents and compact protein regions, that are very poor in activating lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase. Based on these results, we propose a model to explain the origin of the different classes and subclasses of the discoidal r-HDL particles."
https://openalex.org/W1565160468,"Abstract To study the structure-function relationships of follitropin (FSH), we expressed the hormone in a heterologous cell system. A genomic clone bearing a 3.7-kilobase FSH beta insert containing the entire coding sequence was transfected alone or together with the alpha subunit gene into Chinese hamster ovary cells and stable lines expressing either FSH beta or FSH dimer were selected. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that, when transfected alone FSH beta was very slowly secreted similar to lutropin beta and thyrotropin beta but unlike choriogonadotropin beta which is efficiently secreted. However, cotransfection of the FSH beta and alpha subunit genes resulted in rescue of the beta subunit and rapid secretion of dimer. These data support the hypothesis that the glycoprotein hormones of pituitary origin have determinants for secretion that differ from those on the placental hormone, choriogonadotropin. Recombinant FSH stimulated steroidogenesis comparable to purified human FSH isolated from pituitaries in an in vitro rat granulosa cell assay and appears more homogeneous by chromatofocusing. Human FSH produced by this cell line provides a source of bioactive FSH for experimental and clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W1565777522,"Abstract Purified muscarinic receptors (0.5-10 nmol of L-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate-binding sites/mg of protein) from bovine brain and the GTP-dependent regulatory protein, Go, were reconstituted with a lipid mixture of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. Essentially all of the receptors could interact with Go as evinced by increases in affinity for agonist as large as 800-fold. Both the alpha and beta gamma subunits of Go were required for this effect. Similarly, both subunits were required for the stimulation of guanine nucleotide exchange by agonists. This latter action of the receptor on Go was catalytic and potentiated markedly by prior treatment with dithiothreitol. Initially, agonist stimulation of association of GTP and guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) to Go was small and variable due to high basal rates. Prior addition of excess GDP inhibited the basal rate of exchange but allowed stimulation by agonists. Under these conditions, oxotremorine stimulated the rates of association of GTP gamma S up to 10-fold. This selective effect was not mimicked by GTP which inhibited both the basal and hormone-dependent rates. Direct examination of the association of GTP and GDP to Go demonstrated that agonist caused either stimulation or marked inhibition, respectively. These results indicate that receptors stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange on G proteins by both increasing the rates of dissociation of nucleotides and altering their relative affinities such that binding of GTP becomes highly favored over GDP. This would ensure the activation of G proteins by receptors in the presence of both nucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1603934734,"Abstract Trypanosoma brucei brucei is an important pathogen of domestic cattle in sub-Saharan Africa and is closely related to the human sleeping sickness parasites, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. However, T. b. brucei is non-infectious to humans. The restriction of the host range of T. b. brucei results from the sensitivity of the parasite to lysis by toxic human high density lipoproteins (HDL) (Rifkin, M. R. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 3450-3454). We show in this report that trypanosome lytic activity is not a universal feature of all human HDL particles but rather that it is associated with a minor subclass of HDL. We have purified the lytic activity about 8,000-fold and have identified and characterized the subspecies of HDL responsible for trypanosome lysis. This class of HDL has a relative molecular weight of 490,000, a buoyant density of 1.21-1.24 g/ml, and a particle diameter of 150-210 A. It contains apolipoproteins AI, AII, CI, CII, and CIII, and monoclonal antibodies against apo-AI and apo-AII inhibit trypanocidal activity. In addition to these common apolipoproteins, the particles also contain at least three unique proteins, as measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Treatment of the particles with dithiothreitol resulted in the disappearance of two of the proteins and abolished trypanocidal activity. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that these proteins were a disulfide-linked trimer of 45,000, 36,000, and 13,500-Da polypeptides and dimers of the 36,000- and 13,500-Da polypeptides or of 65,000- and 8,500-Da polypeptides. Studies on the lysis of T. b. brucei by the purified particle suggest that the lytic pathway may involve the uptake of the trypanocidal subspecies of HDL by endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1983988848,"Chicken immunoglobulin light chain (IgL) gene rearrangement has been characterized. Rearrangement of the single variable (VL) segment with the single joining (JL) segment within the chicken IgL locus results in the deletion of the DNA between VL and JL from the genome. This deletion is accomplished by a molecular mechanism in which a precise joining of the IgL recombination signal sequences leads to the formation of a circular episomal element. The circular episome is an unstable genetic element that fails to be propagated during B cell development. Evidence was obtained that the formation of the circular episome is accompanied by the addition of a single nonrandom base to both the VL and JL coding segments. The subsequent joining of the VL and JL segments appears to occur at random, as we observed at least 25 unique V-J junction sequences, 11 of which are out-of-frame. A novel recombination mechanism that accounts for the observed features of chicken IgL gene rearrangement is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2004298887,"The D. melanogaster transformer-2 (tra-2) gene regulates somatic sexual differentiation in females and is necessary for spermatogenesis in males. Wild-type tra-2 function is required for the female-specific splicing of the pre-mRNA of the next known gene (doublesex) downstream of tra-2 in the sex determination regulatory hierarchy. The tra-2 gene was cloned, and P element-mediated transformation was used to demonstrate that a 3.9 kb genomic fragment contains all sequences necessary for tra-2 function. A 1.7 kb transcript was shown to be the product of the tra-2 locus based on its reduced level in flies containing a tra-2 mutant allele. The sequence of a cDNA corresponding to this transcript indicates that it encodes a polypeptide with strong similarity to a family of RNA binding proteins that includes proteins found associated with hnRNPs and snRNPs, suggesting that the tra-2 product may directly regulate the processing of the double-sex pre-mRNA in females."
https://openalex.org/W1590773131,"Abstract Tau is a heat-stable microtubule-associated protein which promotes tubulin polymerization. The assembly promoting region of tau was localized using synthetic peptides modeled after domains found in both human and mouse tau. The design of these synthetic peptides was based on the triple repeat motif found in mouse tau. The first peptide, Tau-(187-204), and the second peptide, Tau-(218-235), are capable of promoting the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules, at concentrations above 100 microM. Two other peptides tested, TauR and Tau-(250-267), were not able to promote the assembly of tubulin over a range of concentrations up to 800 microM. TauR is a random analog of Tau-(187-204). Although TauR is unable to promote polymerization, it can modify Tau-(187-204)-induced tubulin assembly."

https://openalex.org/W1598811569,"Abstract The structure of purified preparations of activated (DNA-binding) glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was analyzed in the presence or absence of DNA. A 35-base pair DNA fragment harboring a strong GR-binding site from the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (-189/-166) was used for stoichiometric analysis of the GR.DNA complex. Glycerol gradient centrifugation was utilized in order to separate the 6 S GR.DNA complex from the 4 S GR and the 3 S DNA fragment. Synthetic glucocorticoid [3H]triamcinolone acetonide bound to GR and 32P-5'-end-labeled DNA fragment were used as probes for quantitation of each component. Such experiments demonstrated that two hormone molecules (two 87.5-kDa GR peptides) are associated with each cognate DNA site. Quantitative DNase I footprinting confirmed this result. The formation of the GR.DNA complex was ligand-dependent, but once formed the complex remained stable after ligand dissociation. Incubation of GR with 0.01-0.1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde resulted in a shift in its sedimentation rate from 4 to 6 S. Gel filtration chromatography of glutaraldehyde-treated GR resulted in a complex of slightly larger size than the gamma-globulin standard (158 kDa). Gel filtration of GR without glutaraldehyde treatment gave the identical result. This suggests that a GR multimer, probably a homodimer, is stable during gel filtration chromatography but needs to be stabilized by glutaraldehyde cross-linking or DNA during glycerol gradient centrifugation. We conclude that the activated GR exists as a homodimer when unbound as well as when bound to DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1554849694,"Previously we reported that chymotryptic fragments of bovine adrenal 190-kDa microtubule-associated proteins (27-kDa fragment) and bovine brain tau (14-kDa fragment) contained microtubule-binding domain (Aizawa, H., Murofushi, H., Kotani, Hisanaga, S., Hirokawa, N., and Sakai, H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3782-3787; Aizawa, H., Kawasaki, H., Murofushi, H., Kotani, S., Suzuki, K., and Sakai, H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7703-7707). In order to study the structure of microtubule-binding domain of the two microtubule-associated proteins, we analyzed the amino acid sequence of the 27-kDa fragment and compared the sequence with that of the 14-kDa fragment. This revealed that 190-kDa microtubule-associated protein and tau contained at least one common sequence of 20 amino acid residues in their microtubule-binding domains. A synthetic polypeptide corresponding to the common sequence (Lys-Asn-Val-Arg-Ser-Lys-Val-Gly-Ser-Thr-Glu-Asn-Ile-Lys- His-Gln-Pro-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Ala-Lys) was bound to microtubules competitively with the 190-kDa MAP. The apparent dissociation constant (KD) for the binding of the polypeptide to microtubules was estimated to be 1.8 x 10(-4) M, and the maximum binding reached 1.2 mol of the synthetic polypeptide/mol of tubulin dimer. This synthetic polypeptide increased the rate and extent of tubulin polymerization and decreased the critical concentration of tubulin for polymerization. The polypeptide-induced tubulin polymers were morphologically normal microtubules and were disassembled by cold treatment. The common sequence (termed assembly-promoting sequence) was thus identified as the active site of 190-kDa microtubule-associated protein and tau for the promotion of microtubule assembly. The reconstitution system of microtubules with this synthetic polypeptide with assembly-promoting sequence may be useful to elucidate detailed molecular mechanism of the promotion of microtubule assembly by microtubule-associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1574059019,"In order to carry out studies on structure and function relationships of porcine pepsinogen using site-directed mutagenesis approaches, the cDNA of this zymogen was cloned, sequenced, expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein refolded, and purified to homogeneity. Porcine pepsinogen cDNA, obtained from a lambda gt10 cDNA library of porcine stomach contains 1364 base pairs. It contains leader, pro, and pepsin regions of 14, 44, and 326 residues, respectively. In addition, it also contains 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions. Four differences are present between the sequence deduced from the cDNA and the pepsinogen sequence determined previously by protein chemistry methods. Residues P19 (in the pro region) and 263 are asparagines in the cDNA sequence instead of aspartic acids. Isoleucine 230 is not present in the cDNA sequence and residue 242 is a tyrosine in the cDNA instead of an aspartic acid. Porcine pepsinogen cDNA was placed under the control of a tac promoter in a plasmid and expressed in E. coli. The synthesis of pepsinogen was optimized to about 50 mg/liter of culture. The recombinant (r-) pepsinogen, which was insoluble, was recovered by centrifugation, washed, dissolved in 6 M urea in Tris-HCl, pH 8, and refolded by rapid dilution. r-pepsinogen was purified to homogeneity after chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 and fast protein liquid chromatography on a monoQ column. r-pepsinogen contains an additional methionine residue at the NH2 terminus as compared to native (n-) pepsinogen. However, r- and n-pepsinogens are indistinguishable in their intramolecular activation constants. After activation, r- and n-pepsins have the same NH2-terminal sequences as well as Km values. Based on these data, r-pepsinogen was judged suitable for mutagenesis studies. A mutant pepsinogen (D32A) with the active site aspartic acid changed to an alanine was produced and purified. D32A-pepsinogen did not convert to pepsin in acid solution but it bound to pepstatin with an apparent KD of about 5 x 10(-10) M. D32A-pepsinogen possesses no detectable proteolytic activity. These results indicate that (i) intramolecular pepsinogen activation is accomplished by the pepsin active site, and (ii) unlike subtilisin (Carter, P., and Wells, J. A. (1988) Nature 332, 564-568), the active site mutant of pepsin is not enzymically active."
https://openalex.org/W1595622217,"Abstract The binding of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells was investigated using purified 125I-labeled or L-[35S]methionine-labeled PAI-1 as probes. Little specific binding of latent PAI-1 to ECM previously depleted of endogenous PAI-1 could be demonstrated. In contrast, the guanidine-activated form of PAI-1 bound to ECM in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and binding was saturable. The dissociation constant (Kd) for this interaction was estimated to be 60 nM by Scatchard analysis, and approximately 6 pmol of activated PAI-1 was bound per cm2 of ECM. Binding was relatively specific since unlabeled, activated PAI-1 competed with 35S-labeled PAI-1 for binding to ECM, but latent PAI-1 did not. Moreover, PAI-2, protein C inhibitor (i.e. PAI-3), protease nexin-1, and alpha 2-antiplasmin were not able to compete. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) also inhibited binding, but diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inactivated tPA did not. Pretreatment of ECM with tPA, urokinase-type PA, or thrombin had no effect on its ability to subsequently bind PAI-1, whereas trypsin, plasmin, and elastase pretreatment greatly reduced its ability to bind PAI-1. Guanidine-activated, radiolabeled PAI-1 resembled active endogenous PAI-1 since it was unstable in solution but stable when bound to ECM. In addition, it formed complexes with tPA that had a relatively low affinity for ECM. These data suggest that ECM of bovine aortic endothelial cells contains a protease-sensitive structure that binds active PAI-1 tightly and relatively selectively and that this association stabilizes PAI-1 against the spontaneous loss of activity that occurs in solution."
https://openalex.org/W1538948795,"The action of phospholipases A2 and C in the course of collagen-stimulated platelet activation and the effect of cytochalasins on the responses were studied. Stimulation of human platelets with collagen was accompanied by aggregation, Ca2+ mobilization, inositol phosphate formation, and arachidonic acid release. However, in the presence of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor or a thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonist, collagen induced only weak arachidonic acid release and weak inositol phosphate formation. The TXA2 mimetic agonist U46619 induced all the responses except for arachidonic acid release, which was induced by synergistic action of collagen and U46619. The result that U46619 did not induce arachidonic acid release despite the activation of phospholipase C suggested that arachidonic acid was not released via phospholipase C but by phospholipase A2. These findings suggested that collagen initially induced weak activation of phospholipases A2 and C and that further activation of phospholipase C as well as Ca2+ mobilization and aggregation were induced by TXA2, whereas further activation of phospholipase A2 required the synergistic action of collagen and TXA2. Platelets pretreated with cytochalasins did not respond to collagen. Further analysis revealed that the initial activation of phospholipases A2 and C was specifically inhibited by cytochalasins, but the responses induced by U46619 or a synergistic action of collagen and U46619 were not inhibited. Therefore, we proposed that interaction of collagen receptor with actin filaments might have some roles in the collagen-induced initial activation of phospholipases."
https://openalex.org/W2091443920,"Specification of cell fate in the compound eye of Drosophila appears to be controlled entirely by cell interactions. The sevenless gene is required for the correct determination of one of the eight photoreceptor cells (R7) in each ommatidium. It encodes a transmembrane protein with a tyrosine kinase domain and is expressed transiently on a subpopulation of ommatidial precursor cells including the R7 precursors. It is shown here that heat shock-induced indiscriminate expression of a sevenless complementary DNA throughout development can correctly specify R7 cell identity without affecting the development of other cells. Furthermore, discontinuous supply of sevenless protein during eye development leads to the formation of mosaic eyes containing stripes of sevenless+ and sevenless- ommatidia, suggesting that R7 cell fate can be specified only within a relatively short period during ommatidial assembly. These results support the hypothesis that the specification of cell fate by position depends on the interaction of a localized signal with a receptor present on many undifferentiated cells, and that the mere presence of the receptor alone is not sufficient to specify cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W1883822388,"The complete amino acid sequence of Achromobacter lyticus protease I (EC 3.4.21.50), which specifically hydrolyzes lysyl peptide bonds, has been established. This has been achieved by sequence analysis of the reduced and S-carboxymethylated protease and of peptides obtained by enzymatic digestion with Achromobacter protease I itself and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease and by chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide. The protease consists of 268 residues with three disulfide bonds, which have been assigned to Cys6-Cys216, Cys12-Cys80, and Cys36-Cys58. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of Achromobacter protease and other serine proteases of bacterial and mammalian origins has revealed that Achromobacter protease I is a mammalian-type serine protease of which the catalytic triad comprises His57, Asp113, and Ser194. It has also been shown that the protease has 9- and 26-residue extensions of the peptide chain at the N and C termini, respectively, and overall sequence homology is as low as 20% with bovine trypsin. The presence of a disulfide bridge between the N-terminal extension Cys6 and Cys216 close to the putative active site in the C-terminal region is thought to be responsible for the generation of maximal proteolytic function in the pH range 8.5-10.7 and enhanced stability to denaturation."
https://openalex.org/W1498186590,"Abstract We reported that phosphorylation by either cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) in vitro induces disassembly of the desmin filaments (Inagaki, M., Gonda, Y., Matsuyama, M., Nishizawa, K., Nishi, Y., and Sato, C. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 5970-5978). For this subunit protein, Ser-29, Ser-35, and Ser-50 within the non-alpha-helical head domain were shown to be the sites of phosphorylation for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Geisler, N., and Weber, K. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 15-20). In the present work, we identified the sites of desmin phosphorylated in vitro by other protein kinase which affects the filament structure. The protein kinase C-phosphorylated desmin was hydrolyzed with trypsin, and the phosphorylated peptides were isolated by reverse-phase chromatography. Sequential analysis of the purified phosphopeptides, together with the known primary sequence, revealed that Ser-12, Ser-29, Ser-38, and Ser-56 were phosphorylated by protein kinase C. All four sites are located within the non-alpha-helical head domain of desmin. Ser-12, Ser-38, and Ser-56, specifically phosphorylated by protein kinase C, have arginine residues at the carboxyl-terminal side (Arg-14, Arg-42, and Arg-59, respectively). Ser-29 phosphorylated by both protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase has arginine residues at the amino and carboxyl termini (Arg-27 and Arg-33). These findings support the view that the head domain-specific phosphorylation strongly influences desmin filament structure; however, each protein kinase differed with regard to site recognition on this domain."
https://openalex.org/W1520069435,"We have shown that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) enhanced A-23187-induced arachidonate release and thromboxane synthesis in human platelets (Mobley, A., and Tai, H. H. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 130, 717-723). The mechanism of enhancement by PMA was not elucidated. In the present study, we have shown that PMA-treated platelets exhibited significantly less [1-14C]arachidonate incorporation than did control platelets. However, no significant change in uptake of labeled linoleate or oleate was observed by PMA treatment. Examination of the two enzyme activities involved in arachidonate incorporation into phospholipids indicated that both arachidonoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) synthase and arachidonoyl-CoA lysophosphatide acyltransferase were inactivated following treatment with PMA or 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl glycerol. When platelets were stimulated with A-23187 plus PMA which produced a significant synergism in thromboxane synthesis, both enzyme activities were substantially less than those in platelets treated with A-23187 alone. In addition to PMA and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl glycerol induced decreases in both enzyme activities, collagen, a platelet agonist which can activate protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), was also found to cause a concentration-dependent attenuation of both enzyme activities. These results suggest that protein kinase C activation induced by PMA or collagen may cause inactivation of both arachidonoyl-CoA synthase and arachidonoyl-CoA lysophosphatide acyltransferase resulting in inhibition of the reincorporation of arachidonate released by A-23187 and, consequently, greater availability of arachidonate for thromboxane synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1647986506,"We have taken advantage of the transformation properties of the cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans R2 to investigate the importance of thioredoxin for photosynthetic growth. The gene encoding thioredoxin m, designated trxM, was cloned from A. nidulans using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe. Based on the nucleotide sequence, thioredoxin m of A. nidulans is composed of 107 amino acids and shares 84, 48, and 48% sequence identity with thioredoxins from Anabaena, spinach, and Escherichia coli, respectively. The trxM gene is single copy and is transcribed on a 510-nucleotide mRNA. We demonstrate that disruption of the trxM gene with a kanamycin resistance gene cartridge is a lethal mutation. Although dispensable in E. coli, thioredoxin is essential for the photosynthetic growth of A. nidulans."
https://openalex.org/W1530574567,"Abstract Other laboratories have reported biphasic effects of heavy metals on protein kinase C activity: stimulation followed by inhibition at higher concentrations. We demonstrate that these earlier findings most likely resulted from a combination of the effect of the heavy metals to liberate Ca2+ from Ca2+-EGTA buffer systems and the direct inhibitory effects of the metals on protein kinase C. Simulations of such interactions substantiate this conclusion. When soluble protein kinase C is prepared without the addition of Ca2+ or chelator, heavy metals (Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Zn2+, in the 10 microM range) inhibit the activity of, and the binding of regulatory ligands to, protein kinase C. Heavy metals inhibit the extent of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding without affecting the affinity of the interaction, an inhibition that is not surmounted by excess phospholipid. Heavy metals also inhibit the phospholipid-dependent catalytic activity of protein kinase C in a manner that excess phosphatidylserine can overcome. The inhibition of enzyme activity by heavy metals cannot be surmounted by excess Ca2+ or Mg2+. The inhibitory effects of heavy metals are not confined to protein kinase C. Heavy metals also inhibit cyclic AMP binding to cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and the catalytic activity of that kinase, but in a distinctly different pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1578172797,"The thermodynamics of the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellobiose, gentiobiose, isomaltose, and maltose have been studied using both high pressure liquid chromatography and microcalorimetry. The hydrolysis reactions were carried out in aqueous sodium acetate buffer at a pH of 5.65 and over the temperature range of 286 to 316 K using the enzymes beta-glucosidase, isomaltase, and maltase. The thermodynamic parameters obtained for the hydrolysis reactions, disaccharide(aq) + H2O(liq) = 2 glucose(aq), at 298.15 K are: K greater than or equal to 155, delta G0 less than or equal to -12.5 kJ mol-1, and delta H0 = -2.43 +/- 0.31 kJ mol-1 for cellobiose; K = 17.9 +/- 0.7, delta G0 = -7.15 +/- 0.10 kJ mol-1 and delta H0 = 2.26 +/- 0.48 kJ mol-1 for gentiobiose; K = 17.25 +/- 0.7, delta G0 = -7.06 +/- 0.10 kJ mol-1, and delta H0 = 5.86 +/- 0.54 kJ mol-1 for isomaltose; and K greater than or equal to 513, delta G0 less than or equal to -15.5 kJ mol-1, and delta H0 = -4.02 +/- 0.15 kJ mol-1 for maltose. The standard state is the hypothetical ideal solution of unit molality. Due to enzymatic inhibition by glucose, it was not possible to obtain reliable values for the equilibrium constants for the hydrolysis of either cellobiose or maltose. The entropy changes for the hydrolysis reactions are in the range 32 to 43 J mol-1 K-1; the heat capacity changes are approximately equal to zero J mol-1 K-1. Additional pathways for calculating thermodynamic parameters for these hydrolysis reactions are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1581810484,"The active sites of a spectrum of beta-glucan endohydrolases with distinct, but related substrate specificities have been probed using a series of epoxyalkyl beta-glycosides of glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose, laminaribiose, laminaritriose, 3O-beta-D-glucosyl-cellobiose and 4O-beta-D-glucosyl-laminaribiose with different aglycon chain lengths. The inactivation of each of the endohydrolases by these compounds results from active site-directed inhibitor action, as indicated by the dependence of the inactivation rate on pH, glycosyl chain length and linkage position, aglycon length, and the protective effect of disaccharides derived from the natural substrates. Comparisons of inhibitor specificity between a Bacillus subtilis 1,3;1,4-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.73), a Streptomyces cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4), a Schizophyllum commune cellulase (EC 3.2.1.4), a Rhizopus arrhizus 1,3-(1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan 3(4)-glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.6), and a Nicotiana glutinosa 1,3-beta-D-glucan 3-glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.39) demonstrated different tolerances for glycosyl linkage positions in the inactivation process and a critical role of aglycon length reflecting differences in the active site geometry of the enzymes. For the B. subtilis endohydrolase it was concluded that the aglycon residue of the inhibitor spans the glycosyl binding subsite occupied by the 3-substituted glucosyl residue involved in the glucosidic linkage cleaved in the natural substrate. Appropriate positioning of the inhibitor epoxide group with respect to the catalytic amino acids in the active site is crucial to the inactivation step and the number of glucosyl residues in the inhibitor affects aglycon chain length specificity. The importance of this effect differs between the glucanases tested and may be related to the number of glycosyl binding subsites in the active site."

https://openalex.org/W1577965127,"The food antioxidants butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) are shown to be metabolized to covalent binding intermediates and various other metabolites by prostaglandin H synthase and horseradish peroxidase. BHA was extensively metabolized by horseradish peroxidase (80% conversion of parent BHA into metabolites) resulting in the formation of three dimeric products. Only two of these dimers were observed in prostaglandin H synthase-catalyzed reactions. In contrast to BHA, BHT proved to be a relatively poor substrate for prostaglandin synthase and horseradish peroxidase, resulting in the formation of a small amount of polar and aqueous metabolites (23% conversion of parent BHT into metabolites). With arachidonic acid as the substrate, prostaglandin H synthase catalyzed the covalent binding of [14C]BHA and [14C]BHT to microsomal protein which was significantly inhibited by indomethacin and glutathione. The covalent binding of BHA and its metabolism to dimeric products were also inhibited by BHT. In contrast, the addition of BHA enhanced the covalent binding of BHT by 400%. Moreover, in the presence of BHA, the formation of the polar and aqueous metabolites of BHT was increased and two additional metabolites, BHT-quinone methide and stilbenequinone, were detected. The increased peroxidase-dependent oxidation of BHT in the presence of BHA is proposed to occur via the direct chemical interaction of BHA phenoxyl radical with BHT or BHT phenoxyl radical. These results suggest a potential role for phenoxyl radicals in the activation of xenobiotic chemicals to toxic metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1564887614,"The tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase from Bacillus subtilis was purified to homogeneity and characterized. It has an alpha 2 subunit structure and a molecular weight of 77,000. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase does not catalyze any significant proofreading. It activates tryptophan as well as the three fluorinated analogues, DL-4-fluoro-, DL-5-fluoro-, or DL-6-fluorotryptophan (4F-, 5F-, and 6F-Trp), in the ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction. In the aminoacylation reaction, the fluorotryptophans act as competitive inhibitors of Trp. Their relative activities follow the same order in both reactions: Trp greater than 4F-Trp greater than 6F-Trp greater than 5F-Trp. This order is the inverse of the order of relative hydrophobicities of these compounds, pointing to the importance of hydrophobic interactions in the selective recognition by tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase among this group of substrates. To define the physical basis of the relative hydrophobicities, the crystallographic structure of 4F-Trp was determined and compared to that of trptophan. Charge distributions calculated for tryptophan and its different fluoroanalogues on the basis of molecular structures were supported by their carbon-13 NMR spectra. Correlations between charge distributions and relative hydrophobicities suggest that the polarity of the C-F bond represents an underlying factor determining the hydrophobicities of 4F-, 5F-, and 6F-Trp, thus relating tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase selectivity toward tryptophan and its fluoroanalogues directly to their electronic configurations."
https://openalex.org/W1578338446,"Expression of the Bacillus subtilis gluconate (gnt) operon is negatively regulated by the gnt repressor which is antagonized by D-gluconate or D-glucono-delta-lactone. The repressor specifically binds to a gnt operator near the gnt promoter. From the results of gel retardation assaying of the gnt repressor and various restriction enzyme digests of a fragment carrying the gnt promoter and the gntR gene, the gnt operator was found to be located within a 141-base pair region containing the gnt promoter. Deoxyribonuclease I protection experiments revealed that the gnt repressor protected a gnt promoter region, between -10 and +15, which contains a region showing dyad symmetry with a sequence showing half-symmetry, ATACTTGTA. A 35-base pair synthetic duplex DNA containing this region showing dyad symmetry specifically bound to the gnt repressor. Through cleavage at two AccI sites in the protected region an 8-base pair deletion was introduced into the region showing dyad symmetry, which made expression of the gnt promoter constitutive. A DNA fragment carrying this deletion did not bind to the repressor. These results clearly indicated that the gnt operator sequence is a sequence containing the region showing dyad symmetry located at the transcription initiation site of the gnt operon. It was also suggested that the gnt operon contains only one operator. The similarity in the recognition between the repressor-operator interaction of the gnt operon and those of Escherichia coli TrpR and its operators was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1556366583,"The effects of pertussis toxin on the steady-state levels of G-protein alpha- and beta-subunits were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The steady-state level Go alpha, a major substrate for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, was unaltered by pertussis toxin treatment for periods up to 100 h for 3T3-L1 cells in culture or up to 3 days in vivo. In 3T3-L1 cells pertussis toxin treatment did not alter levels of Gs alpha-subunits; in S49 cells the level of Gs alpha-subunits declined moderately following by pertussis toxin treatment. The steady-state levels of G beta-subunits, in contrast, were found to decline to less than 50% of the normal cellular complement following pertussis toxin treatment in vitro and in vivo. Inhibitory control of adenylate cyclase, pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gi alpha and Go alpha, and the GTP-dependent shift in agonist-specific binding to beta-adrenergic receptors were attenuated or abolished within 5 h of pertussis toxin treatment, representing effects of the toxin. Stimulatory regulation of adenylate cyclase, in contrast, displayed a progressive enhancement that was first observed 4 h after pertussis toxin treatment, increasing thereafter up until 100 h, the last time point measured. This progressive enhancement of the stimulatory pathway of adenylate cyclase was not manifest at the level of stimulatory receptors, since the Kd and Bmax for one such receptor, the beta-adrenergic receptor, were shown to be unaltered in toxin-treated cells. Furthermore, the potentiation of stimulation of adenylate cyclase was observed in cells stimulated by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and PGE1 alike. The progressive enhancement of the stimulatory pathway correlated best with the decline in G beta-subunit levels that occurs following pertussis intoxication. The changes in both of these parameters occur (12-48 h), as compared to the early events that occur within 5 h. Pertussis toxin action appears to be composed of two, temporally distinct, groups of effects. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of G alpha-subunits, attenuation of the inhibitory regulation of adenylate cyclase, and attenuation of the ability of GTP to induce an agonist-specific shift in receptor affinity are members of the early group of effects. The second group of late effects includes the decline in G beta-subunit levels and the progressive enhancement of the stimulatory pathway of adenylate cyclase. This enhanced stimulatory control at these later times cannot be explained by the attenuation of the inhibitory pathway occurring early, but rather appears as G beta-subunit levels decline."
https://openalex.org/W1532376143,"A genomic phage library was constructed using lymphocyte DNA from a patient with cross-reacting material-positive, moderately severe hemophilia B. The library was screened by using a full-length factor IX cDNA as a hybridization probe. DNA sequence analysis of the factor IX exons and intron/exon junctions revealed a single point mutation at nucleotide 31,311 of the gene. This mutation occurs in the protease domain of factor IXa and changes the codon for isoleucine 397 (ATA) to a threonine codon (ACA). The resulting abnormal protein has been named factor IXVancouver. Factor IXVancouver was isolated from the patient's plasma by barium citrate adsorption, affinity chromatography on a Ca2+-dependent antibody bound to agarose, and anion-exchange chromatography. On gel electrophoresis, the purified protein exhibited a normal molecular weight and a normal pattern of activation cleavages with bovine factor XIa. Kinetic studies on the purified protein indicated that the Km of factor IXaVancouver for human factor X was 3.4 times higher than that of normal factor IXa. The kcat of factor IXaVancouver was 12.5% of the kcat of normal factor IXa. Structural models of the protease domain of human factor IXa and of factor IXaVancouver were constructed, based on the homology of factor IXa with related serine proteases of known structure. The factor IXaVancouver model suggests that hydrogen bonding between the side chain hydroxyl group of threonine 397 and the carbonyl oxygen of tryptophan 385 reduces the ability of factor IXaVancouver to bind factor X in a configuration favoring catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1533411509,"Transcription of the three yolk protein genes of Drosophila melanogaster is under strict developmental regulation. Understanding the mechanism of this regulation requires examination of the DNA sequences and protein factors necessary for normal transcriptional control. We have identified a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, yolk protein factor 1 (YPF1), that has high affinity for a 31-bp sequence in the yolk protein 1 gene. This sequence is within the translated region at a site beginning 148 bp downstream of the transcription initiation site. DNA deletion and substitution analysis demonstrated that this sequence is necessary and sufficient for DNA/YPF1 interaction in vitro and is necessary for normal steady state levels of yolk protein 1 gene RNA in vivo. YPF1 binding activity was detected in extracts from late stage egg chambers and early stage embryos but not from tissues that express yolk protein genes."
https://openalex.org/W1594497930,"Abstract To examine the possibility that insulin might stimulate calmodulin phosphorylation in intact cells, we compared autoradiographs of two-dimensional gels of [35S]methionine- and 32P-labeled proteins from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, before and after immunoprecipitation with anti-calmodulin antiserum. Insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of one or two proteins of approximately 22 kDa and pI 4.6; this increased phosphorylation was accompanied by an apparent shift in the position of the analogous [35S]methionine-labeled proteins towards the anode. In contrast, insulin had no effect on the phosphorylation state of another protein of 18-22 kDa and pI 4.6. This protein was very heavily labeled with [35S]methionine, co-migrated exactly with purified calmodulin, reacted specifically with two anti-calmodulin antibodies by Western blotting, and was specifically immunoprecipitated with the anti-calmodulin antiserum. Similar amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled calmodulin were immunoprecipitated from control and insulin-stimulated cells, arguing against the possibility that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of calmodulin changed its affinity for the antibody. We conclude that calmodulin is phosphorylated to a negligible extent in serum-deprived 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that insulin does not stimulate its phosphorylation under conditions in which it stimulates the phosphorylation of one or more neighboring proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1605117581,"Abstract Uteroferrin, a progesterone-induced secretory protein of the pig uterus, can noncovalently associate with additional progesterone-induced glycoproteins (uteroferrin-associated glycoproteins or UfAP) to form a heterodimer. The UfAP were dissociated from uteroferrin by passage through an immunoaffinity column. The flow through material consisted of two immunologically related variants of different size (Mr = 47,000-50,000 and Mr = 39,000-40,000) forms. By using an antiserum to all molecular weight components of the UfAP, it was shown that these glycoproteins were localized in the glandular epithelium of the uterus. Amino acid sequence analysis of the higher molecular weight (Mr = 47,000-50,000) form indicated it had a common amino-terminal sequence which was distinct from that of the lower molecular weight (Mr = 39,000-40,000) form. Endoglycosidase F treatment converted the Mr = 47,000-50,000 form to a common product with Mr = 43,000. Tryptic peptide analysis showed that the Mr = 39,000-40,000 form was closely related in primary sequence to the larger species. When endometrial RNA was translated in vitro, a single major product (Mr = 45,000) was immunoprecipitated by using the UfAP antiserum. These results suggest that the different forms of the UfAP originate from a single precursor by differential glycosylation and peptide cleavage. Endometrial explant cultures released all forms of the glycoproteins. When [32P]orthophosphate was provided, label was incorporated into the 6-position of D-mannosyl residues on the oligosaccharide chains of the UfAP. Therefore the associated glycoproteins have a structural feature normally associated with lysosomal enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1540289614,"We report the purification and some of the biochemical properties of yolk protein factor I (YPF1). This protein binds to a specific site in the yolk protein 1 gene (yp1) of Drosophila melanogaster. YPF1 has been purified to 95% homogeneity and consists of a heterodimer of two subunits with molecular weights 85,000 and 69,000. The protein is highly asymmetric with a frictional ratio of 1.56 which leads to calculated dimensions of 510 x 51 A when modeled as a prolate ellipsoid of revolution. It binds the yp1 DNA site with a protein/DNA stoichiometry of 1:1. Binding to that site is essentially irreversible with a dissociation rate constant of koff less than or equal to 2 x 10(-7) s-1, which gives the complex a dissociation half-life of approximately 55 days. The measured apparent second order association rate constant is 4 x 10(8) M-1 s-1 resulting in a calculated equilibrium dissociation constant of KD less than or equal to 5 x 10(-16) M. YPF1 also has a 10(8) selectivity for the yp1 site over poly(dA).poly(dT) (KDapp = 2 x 10(-8) M(nucleotide]."
https://openalex.org/W1571970412,"Hypoxic or anemic goats with the A hemoglobin genotype switch to the production of hemoglobin C, resulting in a reduced blood oxygen affinity. However, the physiologic consequences of this switch are not clear. We therefore studied the gas exchange properties of the two hemoglobin types. We found that purified hemoglobins A and C have very similar oxygen affinities and H+ Bohr effects, but in the presence of CO2, the affinity of hemoglobin C is substantially less than that of hemoglobin A. That this is not a nonspecific ionic effect is suggested by identical effects of NaCl on O2 binding to the two proteins and by a 2-fold higher capacity of hemoglobin C to bind CO2. The data can be explained by a class of CO2 binding sites in the beta C chain whose affinity is much higher than that of either of the primary sites or of those in Hb A. Our results suggest that in hemoglobin C-containing red cells CO2 acts as a potent allosteric effector, analogous to the role played by 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in human red blood cells. Goat hemoglobin C may have advantages over hemoglobins A or B in O2 transport under hypoxic conditions or in anemia."
https://openalex.org/W1945000555,"The crystal structure of the binary complex of non-activated ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum and its product 3-phospho-D-glycerate has been determined to 2.9-A resolution. This structure determination confirms the proposed location of the active site (Schneider, G., Lindqvist, Y., Branden, C.-I., and Lorimer, G. (1986) EMBO J. 5, 3409-3415) at the carboxyl end of the beta-strands of the alpha/beta-barrel in the carboxyl-terminal domain. One molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate is bound per active site. All oxygen atoms of 3-phosphoglycerate form hydrogen bonds to groups of the enzyme. The phosphate group interacts with the sidechains of residues Arg-288, His-321, and Ser-368, which are conserved between enzymes from different species as well as with the main chain nitrogens from residues Thr-322 and Gly-323. These amino acid residues constitute one of the two phosphate binding sites of the active site. The carboxyl group interacts with the side chains of His-287, Lys-191, and Asn-111. Implications of the activation process for the binding of 3-phosphoglycerate are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1483430491,"Abstract Cleavage of bacterial alkaline phosphatase by trypsin at the R-11, A-12 bond of both subunits results in changes in the structure and function of the enzyme as previously reported (Roberts, C. H., and Chlebowski, J. F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 729-733; Roberts, C. H., and Chlebowski, J. F. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 7557-7561). A hybrid dimer has been formed by cleaving the R-11, A-12 bond of only one of the two subunits. This enzyme species has been purified and characterized to investigate subunit interactions of this hybrid dimeric enzyme species. Subunit interactions were observed using various methods to study functional and structural properties of the enzyme. In a kinetic study the T-2/A-12 hybrid enzyme was found to have a Vmax similar to the A-12 fully trypsin-modified enzyme. On exposure to EDTA the hybrid was found to lose activity at essentially the same rate as the A-12 enzyme presumably as a consequence of loss of metal ions required for function. On adding metal ions back to the apoenzyme form, activity of the hybrid was reconstituted to a degree similar to that of the native enzyme whereas the activity of the A-12 enzyme was reconstituted to a much lesser extent. The Tm of the hybrid measured by differential scanning calorimetry was closer to the value obtained for the A-12 enzyme than the T-2 enzyme but circular dichroic spectra indicated secondary structural features of the hybrid different from both symmetrical forms of the enzyme. These results provide evidence for strong subunit interactions in the alkaline phosphatase dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1567590709,"Abstract The potential relationship of an intact membrane organization for the synthesis of chondroitin and chondroitin 4-sulfate was examined after modification of a mouse mast cell microsomal system with the nonionic detergent, Triton X-100. The results indicated that Triton X-100 had no effect on the rate of polymerization but had a slight effect on the size of glycosaminoglycan chains. An or pattern of sulfation of newly formed chondroitin was obtained in both the presence and the absence of Triton X-100, and this pattern did not change whether sulfation was initiated concurrent with or subsequent to polymerization. Sulfation of exogenous [14C]chondroitin and exogenous proteo[3H]chondroitin by the microsomal system required Triton X-100 but still produced an all or nothing pattern rather than a random sulfation pattern. When a 100,000 x g supernatant fraction was utilized for sulfation of [14C]chondroitin or proteo[3H]chondroitin, Triton X-100 was not needed, and a partial sulfation pattern was obtained. However, it was similar to the all or nothing pattern in that it still produced two populations, with some chains nonsulfated and others approximately 50% sulfated. When chondroitin hexasaccharide was used with 3'-phosphoadenylylphospho[35S]sulfate, multiple GalNAc residues of the individual hexasaccharides were found to be sulfated. This was relatively independent of Triton X-100 or the concentration of the hexasaccharide acceptors. With soluble enzyme, sulfation of multiple GalNAc residues on the individual hexasaccharide molecules was even greater, so that trisulfated products were found. These results suggest that efficient sulfation of chondroitin is related to enzyme-substrate interaction more than to membrane organization."
https://openalex.org/W1484592475,Abstract The effect of guanine nucleotides and kirromycin on the conformation and stability of the chloroplast elongation factor Tu (EF-Tuchl) from Euglena gracilis has been investigated. Free EF-Tuchl is quite thermolabile but the protein is greatly stabilized by guanine nucleotides. The temperature dependence of the thermal inactivation of EF-Tuchl was used to calculate the amount of stabilization energy conferred by the guanine nucleotides. GDP increases the activation energy for the denaturation process by 77 kcal/mol while GTP increases the activation energy by 51 kcal/mol. The difference in heat stability of free EF-Tuchl and the EF-Tuchl.GDP complex was used to determine a dissociation constant of 1.3 x 10(-7) M at 37 degrees C. The temperature dependence of the dissociation constant allowed the calculation of a delta H degree obsd of -55 kcal/mol and a delta S degree obsd of -146 cal/(mol degree) for GDP binding to EF-Tuchl.EF-Tuchl was found to have a trypsin-sensitive region similar to that observed for Escherichia coli EF-Tu. This loop region was protected by GTP and kirromycin but not by GDP.
