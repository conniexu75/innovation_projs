Xiang et al. report the growth of one-dimensional analogs of these heterostructures on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) through a chemical vapor deposition (see the Perspective by Gogotsi and Yakobson). Single-crystalline monolayers or multilayers of hBN or MoS 2 were grown that maintained the electrical conductivity of the SWCNT. A monolayer of MoS 2 was grown on a trilayer of hBN that encapsulated a SWCNT. Science , this issue p. 537 ; see also p. 506"

However, honey bees are also host to the symbiotic gut bacterium Snodgrassella alvi. Leonard et al. engineered S. alvi to produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)—a stimulus for insect RNA interference defense responses—from a plasmid containing two inverted promoters tagged with a fluorescent label (see the Perspective by Paxton). This dsRNA module can be targeted to interfere with specific bee genes as well as crucial viral and mite genes. The authors found that gene expression could be blocked for at least 15 days as the symbionts established in the bees' guts and continuously expressed the dsRNA constructs. S. alvi with specifically targeted plasmids not only suppressed infection with deformed wing virus but also effectively reduced Varroa mite survival. Science , this issue p. 573 ; see also p. 504"

These advances in early detection have fueled interest in “cancer interception,” the idea that drugs designed to treat advanced cancer might also be useful for cancer prevention. Uckelmann et al. now provide support for this concept in a study of mice genetically predisposed to develop acute myeloid leukemia. Early administration of an epigenetic therapy that had previously been shown to have anticancer activity in advanced leukemia models was able to eliminate preleukemia cells and extend survival of the mice.

Efforts to extend this protocol to alkyl-alkyl coupling are complicated by the prospect of forming two different three-dimensional configurations at each carbon center, corresponding to four possible products. Huo et al. now report that a chiral nickel catalyst can convergently link two mirror-image pairs of alkyl reactants into just one product (see the Perspective by Xu and Watson). The specific reaction couples propargylic halides to zinc-activated aliphatic amides. Science , this issue p. 559 ; see also p. 509"

https://openalex.org/W3004310419,"Accurately determining the crystallographic structure of a material, organic or inorganic, is a critical primary step in material development and analysis. The most common practices involve analysis of diffraction patterns produced in laboratory XRD, TEM, and synchrotron X-ray sources. However, these techniques are slow, require careful sample preparation, can be difficult to access, and are prone to human error during analysis. This paper presents a newly developed methodology that represents a paradigm change in electron diffraction-based structure analysis techniques, with the potential to revolutionize multiple crystallography-related fields. A machine learning-based approach for rapid and autonomous identification of the crystal structure of metals and alloys, ceramics, and geological specimens, without any prior knowledge of the sample, is presented and demonstrated utilizing the electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) technique. Electron backscatter diffraction patterns are collected from materials with well-known crystal structures, then a deep neural network model is constructed for classification to a specific Bravais lattice or point group. The applicability of this approach is evaluated on diffraction patterns from samples unknown to the computer without any human input or data filtering. This is in comparison to traditional Hough transform EBSD, which requires that you have already determined the phases present in your sample. The internal operations of the neural network are elucidated through visualizing the symmetry features learned by the convolutional neural network. It is determined that the model looks for the same features a crystallographer would use, even though it is not explicitly programmed to do so. This study opens the door to fully automated, high-throughput determination of crystal structures via several electron-based diffraction techniques."

The original catalysts were neutral cobalt complexes. Hood et al. now report that positively charged cobalt complexes, stabilized by chelating phosphine ligands, show higher activities at lower pressures than their neutral counterparts, approaching the activities of precious rhodium catalysts. These charged catalysts are particularly adept at accelerating the reactions of internal olefins while avoiding decomposition.

https://openalex.org/W3004176960,"Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), a measure of the number of mitochondrial genomes per cell, is a minimally invasive proxy measure for mitochondrial function and has been associated with several aging-related diseases. Although quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is the current gold standard method for measuring mtDNA-CN, mtDNA-CN can also be measured from genotyping microarray probe intensities and DNA sequencing read counts. To conduct a comprehensive examination on the performance of these methods, we use known mtDNA-CN correlates (age, sex, white blood cell count, Duffy locus genotype, incident cardiovascular disease) to evaluate mtDNA-CN calculated from qPCR, two microarray platforms, as well as whole genome (WGS) and whole exome sequence (WES) data across 1,085 participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and 3,489 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). We observe mtDNA-CN derived from WGS data is significantly more associated with known correlates compared to all other methods (p < 0.001). Additionally, mtDNA-CN measured from WGS is on average more significantly associated with traits by 5.6 orders of magnitude and has effect size estimates 5.8 times more extreme than the current gold standard of qPCR. We further investigated the role of DNA extraction method on mtDNA-CN estimate reproducibility and found mtDNA-CN estimated from cell lysate is significantly less variable than traditional phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (p = 5.44x10-4) and silica-based column selection (p = 2.82x10-7). In conclusion, we recommend the field moves towards more accurate methods for mtDNA-CN, as well as re-analyze trait associations as more WGS data becomes available from larger initiatives such as TOPMed."
https://openalex.org/W3004013987,"Africa, the ancestral home of all modern humans, is the most informative continent for understanding the human genome and its contribution to complex disease. To better understand the genetics of schizophrenia, we studied the illness in the Xhosa population of South Africa, recruiting 909 cases and 917 age-, gender-, and residence-matched controls. Individuals with schizophrenia were significantly more likely than controls to harbor private, severely damaging mutations in genes that are critical to synaptic function, including neural circuitry mediated by the neurotransmitters glutamine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and dopamine. Schizophrenia is genetically highly heterogeneous, involving severe ultrarare mutations in genes that are critical to synaptic plasticity. The depth of genetic variation in Africa revealed this relationship with a moderate sample size and informed our understanding of the genetics of schizophrenia worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3003241877,"Melatonin (MT; N-acetyI-5-methoxytryptamine) is an amine hormone involved in abiotic stress resistance. Previous studies have confirmed that melatonin can promote seed germination, mediate physiological regulation mechanisms, and stimulate crop growth under stress. However, the osmotic regulation mechanism by which exogenous melatonin mediates salt tolerance in cotton is still largely unknown. To investigate the effect of salt stress on melatonin concentration in germinating cotton seeds, we analyzed melatonin content over time during seed germination under different treatments. Melatonin content reached its minimum at day 6, while cotton germination rates peaked at day 6, indicating melatonin content and seed germination are correlated. Then we investigated the effects of 10–100 μM melatonin treatments on membrane lipid peroxides and osmotic adjustment substances during cotton seed germination under salt stress. Salt stress led to electrolyte leakage (EL) as well as accumulations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), organic osmotic substances (i.e., proline, soluble sugars), and inorganic osmotic substances (i.e., Na+, Cl-). Meanwhile, the contents of melatonin, soluble proteins, and K+ as well as the K+/Na+ balance decreased, indicating that salt stress inhibited melatonin synthesis and damaged cellular membranes, seriously affecting seed germination. However, melatonin pretreatment at different concentrations alleviated the adverse effects of salt stress on cotton seeds and reduced EL as well as the contents of H2O2, MDA, Na+, and Cl-. The exogenous application of melatonin also promoted melatonin, soluble sugar, soluble proteins, proline, and K+/Na+ contents under salt stress. These results demonstrate that supplemental melatonin can effectively ameliorate the repression of cotton seed germination by enhancing osmotic regulating substances and adjusting ion homeostasis under salt stress. Thus, melatonin may potentially be used to protect cotton seeds from salt stress, with the 20 μM melatonin treatment most effectively promoting cotton seed germination and improving salt stress tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3003973921,"A learning mechanism in the striatum An intriguing characteristic of the striatum is the random spatial distribution and high degree of intermingling between expression of dopamine receptor types 1 (D1) and 2 (D2) within striatal projection neurons (SPNs). The resulting highly entropic mosaic extends through a homogeneous space and is mostly devoid of histological boundaries. The rules established locally by D1- and D2-expressing SPNs (D1-SPNs and D2-SPNs) are thus likely critical in defining how functional territories develop throughout the striatum. Matamales et al. found that activated D2-SPNs access and modify developing behavioral programs encoded by regionally defined ensembles of transcriptionally active D1-SPNs. This process is slow because it depends on the molecular integration of additive neuro-modulatory signals. However, with time, it creates the regional functional boundaries that are necessary to identify and shape specific learning in the striatum. Science , this issue p. 549"
https://openalex.org/W3105616296,"Pulsar timing detects frame dragging Frame dragging is a predicted phenomenon in general relativity, whereby a rotating mass drags the surrounding spacetime around with it. Venkatraman Krishnan et al. analyzed timing observations of PSR J1141-6545, a young pulsar in a binary orbit with a white dwarf. Modeling the arrival times of the radio pulses showed a long-term drift in the orbital parameters. After considering possible contributions to this drift, they concluded that it is dominated by frame dragging (the Lense-Thirring effect) of the rapidly spinning white dwarf. These observations verify a prediction of general relativity and provide constraints on the evolutionary history of the binary system. Science , this issue p. 577"
https://openalex.org/W3003614825,"Coastal areas are urbanizing at unprecedented rates, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Combinations of long-standing and emerging problems in these urban areas generate vulnerability for human well-being and ecosystems alike. This baseline study provides a spatially explicit global systematization of these problems into typical urban vulnerability profiles for the year 2000 using largely sub-national data. Using 11 indicator datasets for urban expansion, urban population growth, marginalization of poor populations, government effectiveness, exposures and damages to climate-related extreme events, low-lying settlement, and wetlands prevalence, a cluster analysis reveals a global typology of seven clearly distinguishable clusters, or urban profiles of vulnerability. Each profile is characterized by a specific data-value combination of indicators representing mechanisms that generate vulnerability. Using 21 studies for testing the plausibility, we identify seven key profile-based vulnerabilities for urban populations, which are relevant in the context of global urbanization, expansion, and climate change. We show which urban coasts are similar in this regard. Sensitivity and exposure to extreme climate-related events, and government effectiveness, are the most important factors for the huge asymmetries of vulnerability between profiles. Against the background of underlying global trends we propose entry points for profile-based vulnerability reduction. The study provides a baseline for further pattern analysis in the rapidly urbanizing coastal fringe as data availability increases. We propose to explore socio-ecologically similar coastal urban areas as a basis for sharing experience and vulnerability-reducing measures among them."

https://openalex.org/W3004269663,"Low-income, racial/ethnic minority groups have disproportionately high rates of problematic substance use yet face barriers in accessing evidence-based interventions (EBIs). Peer recovery coaches (PRCs), individuals with lived experience with problematic substance use, may provide an effective approach to reaching these individuals. Traditionally PRCs have focused on bridging to other types of care rather than delivering EBIs themselves. The aim of this study was to assess perceptions of the appropriateness of a PRC-delivered adapted behavioral activation (BA) intervention to reduce problematic substance use for individuals not engaged in care. This study was conducted at a community resource center in Baltimore, Maryland serving low-income and homeless clients who have high rates of problematic substance use yet also face barriers to accessing care. Guided by the ADAPT-ITT framework, we conducted semi-structured key informant interviews with clients (n = 30) with past or present problematic substance use, and a focus group with community providers, including staff at the community resource center (n = 5) and PRCs (n = 6) from the community. Thirty percent (n = 9) of clients interviewed reported past problematic substance use and 70% (n = 21) met criteria for current use, most commonly cocaine and opioids. Clients, center staff, and PRCs shared that PRC-delivered BA could be acceptable and appropriate with suggested adaptations, including adding peer-delivered case-management and linkage to care alongside BA, and tailoring BA to include activities that are accessible and feasible in the community. These findings will inform the adaptation of PRC-delivered BA to address problematic substance use in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W3003885991,"Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) is a multielement combat sport where fighters need to quickly react to an opponent’s movements under fatigued conditions. Research indicates that fast reaction time is important in many sports, but the effect of fatigue has shown negative, null, or even positive influences on reaction time. However, few studies have been conducted in a controlled setting, especially using MMA figthers, whose matches are frequently resolved in a split-second. Therefore, this study investigated whether acute neuromuscular fatigue affects reaction and movement times, and their consistency in MMA fighters (N = 45). Before and after an upper-body Wingate test, a simple visual reaction time task was completed. Results showed a significant negative effect of fatigue on the reaction times and their consistency, with longer reactions (1.5% change) and lower consistency (14.7% change) after the Wingate test. Further, greater amounts of fatigue during the Wingate test seemed to negatively affect the consistency of post-Wingate movement time. Due to cumulative fatigue and the dynamic nature of MMA, our data indicate that not only the decrements in aerobic and anaerobic power likely affect a fighter’s performance, but their reaction time and motor time may also be compromised during a fight."
https://openalex.org/W3003665845,"Purpose The purpose was to explore the exercise behavior of the Taiwanese population during leisure time and to examine the gender differences in related influential factors. Methods The Leisure Time and Sport Questionnaire (LTSQ) conducted by the Academia Sinica in 2007 was used for analysis. Participants were drawn from the Taiwanese population aged over 18 years old. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to test the association between the frequency of exercise and related factors in all the participants, male, and female participants, respectively. Results In the total 2,147 participants, 47.8% reported they regularly exercised, 34.1% irregularly exercised, and 18.1% never exercised. There were no significant gender differences in the frequency of exercise, but a significant gender difference was found in the types of exercise most often practiced. Participants in one of following conditions, over 65 and under 40 years old, living in the city, having higher education levels, having a spouse or partner, enjoying exercise, feeling worthwhile to spend money on exercise, and not having to take care of others, were more likely to be engaged in regular exercise in the total population. The “enjoyment” in exercise was a significant influential factor for both sexes. Women were more likely to exercise regularly if they were aged 40–64 years old compared with those over 65 years old, have lower self-rated health scores, felt it was more worthwhile to spend money on exercise and did not have to care for another, whereas men who have higher education level and did not feel a lack of time were more likely to exercise regularly. Conclusions There are gender differences in regular exercise behavior during leisure time and related influential factors among Taiwanese adults. The findings of the present study can be used when designing gender-specific health promotion programs."
https://openalex.org/W3003493811,"Obesity has become an epidemic concern in modern society. The chronic obesity is associated with metabolic disorders, such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver, and cadiovascular disease, which cause high risk for mortality. The novel potential strategy to overcome obesity is to burn out the extra fat via of the white adipose tissues. The phytochemical resveratrol (Res) has attracted substantial attention due to its powerful amelioratory effects in metabolic diseases. However, how Res regulates the browning of adipose tissues remains largely elusive. Our data show that the NAD+ -dependent deacetylase silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) mediates Res-induced browning and fat reduction of adipocytes, as well as other Res-improved metabolic phenotypes including hyperglycemina and hyperlipidemia in mice. Interestingly, we found that the major metabolites of Res in vivo (Res-3-O-glucuronide, Res-4'-O-glucuronide, and Res-3-O-sulfate) were much less potent in promoting browning gene expressions and reducing fat content in comparison to Res itself in mouse and human adipocytes in vitro, suggesting the importance and necessarity to enhance the bioavailability of Res in vivo in consideration of therapeutic application. Taken together, our findings clarify the beneficial effects of Res on excess fat utilization via promotion of browning in a Sirt1-dependent manner, suggesting the potential therapeutic application of Res in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3003395514,"Lady's-slipper orchid (Cypripedium calceolus) is considered an endangered species in most countries within its geographical range. The main reason for the decline in the number of populations of this species in Europe is habitat destruction. In this paper the ecological niche modelling approach was used to estimate the effect of future climate change on the area of niches suitable for C. calceolus. Predictions of the extent of the potential range of this species in 2070 were made using climate projections obtained from the Community Climate System Model for four representative concentration pathways: rcp2.6, rcp4.5, rcp6.0 and rcp8.5. According to these analyses all the scenarios of future climate change will result in the total area of niches suitable for C. calceolus decreasing. Considering areas characterized by a suitability of at least 0.4 the loss of habitat will vary between ca. 30% and 63%. The highest habitat loss of ca. 63% is predicted to occur in scenario rcp 8.5. Surprisingly, in the most damaging rcp 8.5 prediction the highest overlap between potential range of C. calceolus and its pollinators will be observed and in all other scenarios some pollinators will be available for this species in various geographical regions. Based on these results at least two approaches should be implemented to improve the chances of survival of C. calceolus. In view of the unavoidable loss of suitable habitats in numerous European regions, conservation activities should be intensified in areas where this species will still have suitable niches in the next 50 years. In addition, for C. calceolus ex-situ activities should be greatly increased so that it can be re-introduced in the remaining suitable areas."
https://openalex.org/W3003858944,"Arboviruses cause diseases of significant global health concerns. Interactions between mosquitoes and their microbiota as well as the important role of this interaction in the mosquito's capacity to harbor and transmit pathogens have emerged as important fields of research. Aedes aegypti is one of the most abundant mosquitoes in many geographic locations, a vector capable of transmitting a number of arboviruses such as dengue and Zika. Currently, there are few studies on the metavirome of this mosquito particularly in the Americas. This study analyzes the metavirome of A. aegypti from Grenada, a Caribbean nation with tropical weather, abundant A. aegypti, and both endemic and arboviral pathogens transmitted by this mosquito. Between January and December 2018, 1152 mosquitoes were collected from six semi-rural locations near houses in St. George Parish, Grenada, by weekly trapping using BG-Sentinel traps. From these, 300 A. aegypti were selected for analysis. The metavirome was analyzed using the Illumina HiSeq 1500 for deep sequencing. The generation sequencing library construction protocol used was NuGEN Universal RNA with an average read length of 125 bp. Reads were mapped to the A. aegypti assembly. Non-mosquito reads were analyzed using the tools FastViromeExplorer. The NCBI total virus, RNA virus, and eukaryotic virus databases were used as references. The metagenomic comparison analysis showed that the most abundant virus-related reads among all databases and assemblies was Phasi Charoen-like virus. The Phasi Charoen-like virus results are in agreement to other studies in America, Asia and Australia. Further studies using wild-caught mosquitoes is needed to assess the impact of this insect-specific virus on the A. aegypti lifecycle and vector capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3003196811,"Rationale Ineffective peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR) generation in patients using inhalers results in insufficient drug delivery to the lungs and poor clinical outcomes. Low inspiratory muscle strength is associated with suboptimal PIFR. Objective To examine in a prospective study the relationship between PIFR and skeletal muscle strength using hand grip strength (HGS) as a surrogate. Methods Adult patients admitted with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were enrolled. PIFR was measured within 48 hours before discharge. PIFR below 60L/min was considered suboptimal. HGS was measured using a handheld dynamometer. Any readmissions and emergency department visit data were collected. The associations between PIFR, HGS, 30 and 90-day COPD and all-cause readmissions were examined, without and with adjustment for age, race and gender. Results Of the 75 enrolled patients, 56% had suboptimal PIFR; they were older (63.9±9.7 vs. 58.2±7.7 years) and had significantly lower HGS (24.2±11.1 vs. 30.9±10.9 Kg) compared to those with optimal PIFR. There were no significant differences between the two PIFR groups by gender, race, history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension or functional scores. Each kilogram increase in HGS was associated with 0.50 (95%CI 0.18–0.89, p = 0.003) L/min increase in PIFR. We did not observe an association between PIFR and 30 or 90-day readmission rates. Conclusion We found a significant association between HGS and PIFR in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Whether interventions aimed at increasing skeletal muscle strength also result in improvement in PIFR remains unclear and need further study."
https://openalex.org/W3004053027,"Background Anxiety can create serious disruption in the life and mind of youth who are affected. Youth living with anxiety suffer a wealth of physical and psychological challenges, yet little is known about how anxiety influences the sense of the self. The purpose of this research was to explore the experience of the self in a sample of Canadian youth living with anxiety. Materials and methods The qualitative research approach of hermeneutic phenomenology was used. The sample consisted of 58 Canadian youth with anxiety, 44 females and 14 males between the ages of 10 and 22. Youth took part in open-ended interviewing, ecomaps, and photovoice. Data analysis followed a staged process, informed by Max van Manen. All sources of data were included in the analysis to form thematic statements. Results Entering into the lifeworld of youth revealed that they suffered deeply. A fractured sense of self underlined their experience, setting up for a great deal of self-scrutiny and a lack of self-compassion. They experienced a profound sense of responsibility for others at the loss of being-there-for-oneself. Navigating their social sphere presented an additional challenge. However, youth were genuinely interested in self-discovery through awareness and reflection. Conclusions The phenomenological accounts by youth on living with anxiety reinforce the challenges they experienced within themselves that give rise to a great deal of inner turmoil. Care and support to youth with anxiety requires an understanding of the ways in which the self may be fractured by their experiences with anxiety. Providing young people with an opportunity to share with others who had similar lived experiences can serve to contribute to a sense of healing for youth, while also providing a safe space in which young people can let down their guard and openly acknowledge or share their experiences without fear of stigmatization."
https://openalex.org/W3003176037,"Objective Exposure to toxic metals such as mercury has been proposed to be a risk factor for the development of breast cancer since some metals can promote genetic mutations and epigenetic changes. We sought to find what toxic metals are present in normal breast tissue and in the tumours of women who had mastectomies for invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Materials and methods Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks from mastectomies for breast carcinoma were examined from 50 women aged 34–69 years. Paraffin blocks selected for elemental analysis were from breast tissue not involved by carcinoma and from the carcinoma itself. Seven micrometer-thick sections were stained with autometallography to demonstrate the presence of mercury, and subjected to laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to confirm the presence of mercury and to detect other toxic metals. Results Autometallography-detected mercury was seen in intraductal secretions and some luminal epithelial cells of normal breast lobules in 26 (55%) of the 47 samples where lobules were present, and in 10 (23%) of carcinomas from the 44 samples where carcinoma was present. In eight samples ductal carcinoma in situ was present and one of these contained mercury. LA-ICP-MS confirmed the presence of mercury in samples that stained with autometallography, and detected lead, iron, nickel, aluminium, chromium and cadmium in some samples. Conclusions Mercury was present in normal breast lobules in more than half of mastectomy samples that contained an invasive carcinoma, and in a smaller proportion of carcinomas and ductal carcinomas in situ. Other toxic metals that may interact synergistically with mercury could be detected in some samples. These findings do not provide direct evidence that toxic metals such as mercury play a role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, but suggest that future molecular biological investigations on the role of toxic metals in breast cancer are warranted."

However, the intricate functional redundancy between RB1 and the related pocket proteins RBL1/p107 and RBL2/p130 in suppressing tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. Here we performed lineage-restricted parallel inactivation of rb1 and rbl1 by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in the true diploid Xenopus tropicalis to gain insight into this in vivo redundancy. We show that while rb1 inactivation is sufficient to induce choroid plexus papilloma, combined rb1 and rbl1 inactivation is required and sufficient to drive SC-PaNEC, retinoblastoma and astrocytoma. Further, using a novel Li-Fraumeni syndrome-mimicking tp53 mutant X. tropicalis line, we demonstrate increased malignancy of rb1/rbl1-mutant glioma towards glioblastoma upon concomitant inactivation of tp53. Interestingly, although clinical SC-PaNEC samples are characterized by abnormal p53 expression or localization, in the current experimental models, the tp53 status had little effect on the establishment and growth of SC-PaNEC, but may rather be essential for maintaining chromosomal stability. SCLC was only rarely observed in our experimental setup, indicating requirement of additional or alternative oncogenic insults. In conclusion, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delineate the tumor suppressor properties of Rbl1, generating new insights in the functional redundancy within the retinoblastoma protein family in suppressing neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer and glioma/glioblastoma."

https://openalex.org/W3003843311,"Although harmful consumption of alcohol and other drugs (both illicit and pharmaceutical) significantly contribute to global burden of disease, not all harms are captured within existing morbidity data sources. Indeed, harms occurring in the community may be missed or under-reported. This paper describes the National Ambulance Surveillance System, a unique Australian system for monitoring and mapping acute harms related to alcohol and other drug consumption. Data are sourced from paramedic electronic patient care records provided by ambulance services from across Australia. Coding occurs in a purpose-built system, by a team of specialised research assistants. Alcohol, and specific illicit and pharmaceutical drugs, rather than broad drug classes, are manually coded and the dataset is reviewed and cleaned prior to analysis. The National Ambulance Surveillance System is an ongoing, dynamic surveillance system of alcohol and other drug-related harms across Australia. The data includes more than 140 output variables per attendance, including individual substances, demographics, temporal, geospatial, and clinical data (e.g., Glasgow Coma Scale score, naloxone provision and response, outcome of attendance). The National Ambulance Surveillance System is an internationally unique population-level surveillance system of acute harms arising from alcohol and other drug consumption. Dissemination of National Ambulance Surveillance System data has been used to inform and evaluate policy approaches and potential points of intervention, as well as guide workforce development needs and clinical practice at the local and national level. This methodology could be replicated in other countries."
https://openalex.org/W3003325636,"Although organic matter may accumulate sometimes (e.g. lignocellulose in peat bog), most natural biodegradation processes are completed until full mineralization. Such transformations are often achieved by the concerted action of communities of interacting microbes, involving different species each performing specific tasks. These interactions can give rise to novel “community-intrinsic” properties, through e.g. activation of so-called “silent genetic pathways” or synergistic interplay between microbial activities and functions. Here we studied the microbial community-based degradation of keratin, a recalcitrant biological material, by four soil isolates, which have previously been shown to display synergistic interactions during biofilm formation; Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, Xanthomonas retroflexus, Microbacterium oxydans and Paenibacillus amylolyticus. We observed enhanced keratin weight loss in cultures with X. retroflexus, both in dual and four-species co-cultures, as compared to expected keratin degradation by X. retroflexus alone. Additional community intrinsic properties included accelerated keratin degradation rates and increased biofilm formation on keratin particles. Comparison of secretome profiles of X. retroflexus mono-cultures to co-cultures revealed that certain proteases (e.g. serine protease S08) were significantly more abundant in mono-cultures, whereas co-cultures had an increased abundance of proteins related to maintaining the redox environment, e.g. glutathione peroxidase. Hence, one of the mechanisms related to the community intrinsic properties, leading to enhanced degradation from co-cultures, might be related to a switch from sulfitolytic to proteolytic functions between mono- and co-cultures, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W3003262581,"In addition to age, apolipoprotein E4 (E4), female sex, or a combination of both synergistically increase the risk for the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Why these risk factors predispose an individual to developing AD later in life is the target of the current investigation. Central nervous system (CNS) insulin resistance is associated with cognitive impairment and AD. CNS insulin is acquired primarily from the circulation and therefore must negotiate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Thus, changes in BBB transport of insulin could lead to alterations in CNS insulin signaling and resistance, which would then lead to changes in cognition. There has been recent evidence suggesting the relationship between CNS insulin; E4, a risk factor to develop AD as compared to E3; and the female sex in aged individuals and in pre-clinical models. However, this relationship has been largely unexplored at a younger age, in which some of these risk factors could predispose an individual to dysregulation of CNS insulin later in life. Here, we present the first findings of BBB insulin pharmacokinetics in young E3 and E4 male and female targeted replacement (TR) mice. We found that levels of insulin binding the vasculature at the BBB are different due to genotype and sex which could impact the function of the brain endothelial cell. These early alterations could contribute to or fully explain the age-related cognitive changes observed due to CNS insulin signaling in E4 and/or female individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3003917356,"Proteolytic processing of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry protoxins by insect midgut proteases is critical to their insecticidal activities against target insects. Although transgenic Bt cotton expressing Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab proteins have been widely used for control of the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) in the field, the proteolytic cleavage sites in the two protoxins targeted by H. armigera midgut proteases are still not clear. In this study, the proteolysis of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab protoxins by midgut juice prepared from midgut tissue of H. armigera larvae was investigated. Cleavage of Cry1Ac protoxin by midgut proteases formed a major protein fragment of ~65 kDa, and N-terminal sequencing revealed that cleavage occurred at Arg28 in the fore-end of helix α-1 in domain I of Cry1Ac. Cleavage of Cry2Ab protoxin by midgut juice proteases produced a major protein fragment of ~50 kDa, and the cleavage occurred at Arg139 between helices α-3 and α-4 in domain I of Cry2Ab. The amino acids Arg28 of Cry1Ac and Arg139 of Cry2Ab were predicted as putative trypsin cleavage sites. Bioassay data showed that the toxicities (LC50s) of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab protoxins were equivalent to those of their respective midgut juice-activated toxins in the susceptible SCD strain of H. armigera. Identification of the exact sites of N-terminal activation of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab protoxins will provide a basis for a better understanding of the mode of action and resistance mechanisms based on aberrant activation of these protoxins in H. armigera."
https://openalex.org/W3003211257,"Background While women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) face significant health consequences, their patterns of healthcare services (HCS) utilization are unclear, as are the effects of IPV screening and receiving information on these patterns. Objectives 1. Compare utilization patterns of five HCS (visits to family physician, gynecologist, specialist and emergency room, and hospitalization) in a cohort of perinatal women who reported experiencing versus not experiencing any IPV and IPV types (physical and/or sexual; emotional and/or verbal; social and economic); 2. Examine whether IPV screening, receiving information on support services, or both, affect patterns; and 3. Compare these associations between ethnic groups (Arab and Jewish women). Methods We conducted a prospective study using registry data on HCS utilization obtained from Israel’s largest Health Fund (Clalit) in the year following a 2014–2015 survey of a cohort of 868 perinatal women in Israel (327 Arab minority, 542 Jewish) on their reports of experiencing IPV, IPV screening, and receiving information. Using multivariate analysis, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the five HCS utilizations in association with reports of any IPV and IPV types. We adjusted for IPV screening, receiving information about services, and both, in the total sample, and separately among ethnic groups. Results Any IPV and IPV types had significant associations with some HCS utilization variables, with different directions and patterns for the ethnic groups. Experiencing IPV was associated with higher HCS utilization among Arab women, lower utilization in Jewish women. Arab women experiencing IPV were twice as likely to visit a gynecologist than women not experiencing IPV (AOR (95% CI) was 2.00, 1.14–3.51 for any IPV; 2.17, 1.23–3.81 for emotional and/or verbal IPV, and 1.83, 1.04–3.22, for social and economic IPV). Among Jewish women, experiencing any IPV was associated with lower likelihood of emergency-room visits (0.62, 0.41–0.93); and experiencing physical and/or sexual IPV was associated with lower likelihood of family physician visits (OR = 0.20, 0.05–0.82). Both IPV screening and receiving information were associated with lower HCS utilization among Arab women only. Conclusions Different HCS utilization patterns among women who reported experiencing versus not experiencing IPV in different ethnic groups suggest complex relationships that hinge on how HCS address women’s needs, starting with IPV screening and providing information. This might inform tailored programs to tackle IPV at the HCS, particularly for minority women."
https://openalex.org/W3003272603,"Antimicrobial drugs administered systemically may cause the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacteria. To develop logical, research-based recommendations for food animal veterinarians, we must understand how to maximize antimicrobial drug efficacy while minimizing risk of antimicrobial resistance. Our objective is to evaluate the effect of two approved dosing regimens of enrofloxacin (a single high dose or three low doses) on Escherichia coli in cattle. We look specifically at bacteria above and below the epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF), above which the bacteria are likely to have an acquired or mutational resistance to enrofloxacin. We developed a differential equation model for the antimicrobial drug concentrations in plasma and colon, and bacteria populations in the feces. The model was fit to animal data of drug concentrations in the plasma and colon obtained using ultrafiltration probes. Fecal E. coli counts and minimum inhibitory concentrations were measured for the week after receiving the antimicrobial drug. We predict that the antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacteria above the ECOFF pre-treatment strongly affects the composition of the bacteria following treatment. Faster removal of the antimicrobial drugs from the colon throughout the study leads to improved clearance of bacteria above the ECOFF in the low dose regimen. If we assume a fitness cost is associated with bacteria above the ECOFF, the increased fitness costs leads to reduction of bacteria above the ECOFF in the low dose study. These results suggest the initial E. coli susceptibility is a strong indicator of how steers respond to antimicrobial drug treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3003362106,"Over the centuries, the geographical distribution of brown bear (Ursus arctos) across the Iberian Peninsula has been decreasing, with the species currently confined to North Iberia. The Cantabrian brown bear population is one of the smallest in Europe and is structured into two subpopulations, positioned along an east-west axis. Given the current critically endangered status of this population, it is essential to have a clear picture of its within-population genetic patterns and processes. We use a set of three molecular markers (mitochondrial DNA, autosomal microsatellites and sex markers) to clarify the genetic origins and assess the migration patterns and gene flow of the Cantabrian brown bear population. Our results reveal the presence of two different mitochondrial (matrilineal) haplotypes in the Cantabrian population, both belonging to European brown bear clade 1a. The two haplotypes are geographically structured between Eastern (haplotype CanE) and Western Cantabrian (haplotype CanW) subpopulations, which is consistent with the genetic structure previously identified using nuclear markers. Additionally, we show that CanE is closer to the historical Pyrenean (Pyr) haplotype than to CanW. Despite strong structuring at the levels of mtDNA and nuclear loci, there is evidence of bidirectional gene flow and admixture among subpopulations. Gene flow is asymmetrical and significantly more intense from the Eastern to the Western Cantabrian subpopulation. In fact, we only detected first generation male migrants from the Eastern to the Western Cantabrian subpopulation. These results suggest more intense migration from the smaller and more vulnerable Eastern Cantabrian subpopulation towards the larger and more stable Western Cantabrian subpopulation. These new insights are relevant for assessments of on-going conservation measures, namely the role of dispersal corridors and enhanced connectivity. We discuss the importance of complementary conservation measures, such as human-wildlife conflict mitigation and habitat improvement, for the conservation of a viable Cantabrian brown bear population."
https://openalex.org/W3003811915,"Lack of conceptual clarity and measurement methods have led to underdeveloped efforts to measure experience of participation in care by next of kin to older people in nursing homes.We sought to assess the measurement properties of items aimed at operationalizing participation in care by next of kin, applied in nursing homes.A total of 37 items operationalizing participation were administered via a questionnaire to 364 next of kin of older people in nursing homes. Measurement properties were tested with factor analysis and Rasch model analysis.The response rate to the questionnaire was 81% (n = 260). Missing responses per item varied between <0.5% and 10%. The 37 items were found to be two-dimensional, and 19 were deleted based on conceptual reasoning and Rasch model analysis. One dimension measured communication and trust (nine items, reliability 0.87) while the other measured collaboration in care (nine items, reliability 0.91). Items successfully operationalized a quantitative continuum from lower to higher degrees of participation, and were found to generally fit well with the Rasch model requirements, without disordered thresholds or differential item functioning. Total scores could be calculated based on the bifactor subscale structure (reliability 0.92). Older people (≥ 65 years) reported a higher degree of communication and trust and bifactor total scores than younger people (p < 0.05 in both cases). People with a specific contact person experienced a higher degree of participation in the two subscales and the bifactor total score (p < 0.05 in all three instances).Psychometric properties revealed satisfactory support for use, in nursing home settings, of the self-reported Next of Kin Participation in Care questionnaire, with a bifactor structure. Additional research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the scales' abilities to identify changes after intervention.The KUPA project has Clinical Trials number NCT02708498."
https://openalex.org/W3004043043,"P2X7 is an ATP-gated membrane ion channel that is expressed by multiple cell types. Brief exposure to ATP induces the opening of a nonselective cation channel; while repeated or prolonged exposure induces formation of a transmembrane pore. This process may be partially regulated by alternative splicing of full-length P2RX7A pre-mRNA, producing isoforms that delete or retain functional domains. Here, we report cloning and expression of a novel P2RX7 splice variant, P2RX7L, that is, characterized by skipping of exons 7 and 8. In HEK 293 cells, expression of P2RX7L produces a protein isoform, P2X7L, that forms a heteromer with P2X7A. A haplotype defined by six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs208307, rs208306, rs36144485, rs208308, rs208309, and rs373655596) promotes allele-specific alternative splicing, increasing mRNA levels of P2RX7L and another isoform, P2RX7E, which in addition has a truncated C-terminus. Skipping of exons 7 and 8 is predicted to delete critical amino acids in the ATP-binding site. P2X7L-transfected HEK 293 cells have phagocytic but not channel, pore, or membrane-blebbing function, and double-transfected P2X7L and P2X7A cells have reduced pore function. Heteromeric receptor complexes of P2X7A and P2X7L are predicted to have reduced numbers of ATP-binding sites, which potentially alters receptor function compared to homomeric P2X7A complexes."
https://openalex.org/W3004310990,"Identifying and controlling the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a high priority for researchers and public health officials. One critical component of this control effort is timely detection of emerging or increasing resistance using surveillance programs. Currently, detection of temporal changes in AMR relies mainly on analysis of the proportion of resistant isolates based on the dichotomization of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. In our work, we developed a hierarchical Bayesian latent class mixture model that incorporates a linear trend for the mean log2MIC of the non-resistant population. By introducing latent variables, our model addressed the challenges associated with the AMR MIC values, compensating for the censored nature of the MIC observations as well as the mixed components indicated by the censored MIC distributions. Inclusion of linear regression with time as a covariate in the hierarchical structure allowed modelling of the linear creep of the mean log2MIC in the non-resistant population. The hierarchical Bayesian model was accurate and robust as assessed in simulation studies. The proposed approach was illustrated using Salmonella enterica I,4,[5],12:i:- treated with chloramphenicol and ceftiofur in human and veterinary samples, revealing some significant linearly increasing patterns from the applications. Implementation of our approach to the analysis of an AMR MIC dataset would provide surveillance programs with a more complete picture of the changes in AMR over years by exploring the patterns of the mean resistance level in the non-resistant population. Our model could therefore serve as a timely indicator of a need for antibiotic intervention before an outbreak of resistance, highlighting the relevance of this work for public health. Currently, however, due to extreme right censoring on the MIC data, this approach has limited utility for tracking changes in the resistant population."
https://openalex.org/W3004317783,"Financial barriers are a major obstacle to accessing maternal health care services in low-resource settings. In Madagascar, less than half of live births are attended by skilled health staff. Although mobile money-based savings and payment systems are often used to pay for a variety of services, including health care, data on the implications of a dedicated mobile money wallet restricted to health-related spending during pregnancy–a mobile health wallet (MHW)–are not well understood. In cooperation with the Madagascan Ministry of Health, this study aims to elicit the perceptions, experiences, and recommendations of key stakeholders in relation to a MHW amid a pilot study in 31 state-funded health care facilities. We conducted a two-stage qualitative study using semi-structured in-depth interviews with stakeholders (N = 21) representing the following groups: community representatives, health care providers, health officials and representatives from phone provider companies. Interviews were conducted in Atsimondrano and Renivohitra districts, between November and December of 2017. Data was coded thematically using inductive and deductive approaches, and found to align with a social ecological model. Key facilitators for successful implementation of the MHW, include (i) close collaboration with existing communal structures and (ii) creation of an incentive scheme to reward pregnant women to save. Key barriers to the application of the MHW in the study zone include (i) disruption of informal benefits for health care providers related to the current cash-based payment system, (ii) low mobile phone ownership, (iii) illiteracy among the target population, and (iv) failure of the MHW to overcome essential access barriers towards institutional health care services such as fear of unpredictable expenses. The MHW was perceived as a potential solution to reduce disparities in access to maternal health care. To ensure success of the MHW, direct demand-side and provider-side financial incentives merit consideration."
https://openalex.org/W3003950950,"Objectives The R102G variant in complement 3 (C3) results in two allotypic variants: C3 fast (C3F) and C3 slow (C3S). C3F presents at increased frequency in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), our aim is to explore its role in CKD progression and mortality. Methods Delta (Δ) eGFR for 2038 patients in the Salford Kidney Study (SKS) was calculated by linear regression; those with ≤-3ml/min/1.73m2/yr were defined as rapid progressors (RP) and those with ΔeGFR between -0.5 and +1ml/min/1.73m2/yr, labelled stable CKD patients (SP).A group of 454 volunteers was used as a control group. In addition, all biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis (GN) patients were studied regardless of their ΔeGFR. R102G was analysed by real-time PCR, and genotypic and allelic frequencies were compared between RP and SP along with the healthy control group. Results There were 255 SP and 259 RP in the final cohort. Median ΔeGFR was 0.07 vs. -4.7 ml/min/1.73m2/yr in SP vs. RP. C3F allele frequency was found to be significantly higher in our CKD cohort (25.7%) compared with the healthy control group (20.6%); p = 0.008.However, there was no significant difference in C3F allele frequency between the RP and SP groups. In a subgroup analysis of 37 patients with IgA nephropathy in the CKD cohort (21 RP and 16 SP), there was a significantly higher frequency of C3F in RP 40.5% vs. 9.4% in SP; p = 0.003. In the GN group, Cox regression showed an association between C3F and progression only in those with IgA nephropathy (n = 114);HR = 1.9 (95% CI 1.1–3.1; p = 0.018) for individuals heterozygous for the C3F variant, increased further for individuals homozygous for the variant, HR = 2.8 (95% CI 1.2–6.2; p = 0.014). Conclusion The C3 variant R102G is associated with progression of CKD in patients with IgA nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W3004185520,"Scientific research results are traditionally published as articles in peer-reviewed conference proceedings or journals. These articles often use technical jargon, which precludes the general public from consuming the results achieved. New ways to communicate scientific results are thus necessary to transfer scientific insights to non-experts, and this work proposes the concept of interactive guidelines to fill this gap. A web tool, called Interactive Guidelines Tool, was developed as a proof-of-concept for the idea. It was used in the context of the GEO-C project to communicate research outputs in smart cities scenarios to the public. A comparative analysis between the Interactive Guidelines Tool and related tools helps to highlight the progress it enables beyond the current state of the art. Interactive Guidelines Tool is available as an open-source tool and can be customised/extended by any interested researcher, in the process of making scientific knowledge and insights more accessible and understandable to a broader public."
https://openalex.org/W3004343708,"The genus Anastrepha is a diverse lineage of fruit-damaging tephritid flies widespread across the Neotropical Region. Accurate taxonomic identification of these flies is therefore of paramount importance in agricultural contexts. DNA barcoding libraries are molecular-based tools based on a short sequence of the mitochondrial COI gene enabling rapid taxonomic identification of biological species. In this study, we evaluate the utility of this method for species identification of Peruvian species of Anastrepha and assemble a preliminary barcode profile for the group. We obtained 73 individual sequences representing the 15 most common species, 13 of which were either assigned to previously recognized or newly established BINs. Intraspecific genetic divergence between sampled species averaged 1.01% (range 0-3.3%), whereas maximum interspecific values averaged 8.67 (range 8.26-17.12%). DNA barcoding was found to be an effective method to discriminate between many Peruvian species of Anastrepha that were tested, except for most species of the fraterculus species group, which were all assigned to the same BIN as they shared similar and, in some cases, identical barcodes. We complemented this newly produced dataset with 86 published sequences to build a DNA barcoding library of 159 sequences representing 56 Peruvian species of Anastrepha (approx. 58% of species reported from that country). We conclude that DNA barcoding is an effective method to distinguish among Peruvian species of Anastrepha outside the fraterculus group, and that complementary methods (e.g., morphometrics, additional genetic markers) would be desirable to assist sensu stricto species identification for phytosanitary surveillance and management practices of this important group of pestiferous flies."
https://openalex.org/W3003630201,"Duchenne muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive degenerative muscle disease, affecting, among others, the upper extremities. Effective hand rehabilitation can improve the hand function of people with DMD. To reach this goal, we first need to gain more insight into the hand cognitive-motor performance of people with DMD. This is the first study employing a systematic analysis on multi-finger, cognitive-motor performance of people with DMD. For this purpose, we propose an active dynamic visuo-motor task. The task employed six visual stimuli, a subset of which was activated at each trial. The stimuli were activated with a frequency of 1, 2, 3 and 4 Hz. Eight healthy participants and three participants with DMD performed the task. Additionally, the healthy participants performed seven sessions, and we assessed the training effects. Task-related cognitive-motor performance was evaluated using information transfer rate (ITR) and perceived workload. Regarding ITR, healthy participants performed significantly better than DMD participants; however, this was more evident for trials involving more than three fingers. Workload showed no difference between the healthy and the DMD groups. Healthy participants significantly improved their performance during training. Our results suggest that hand rehabilitation of people with DMD should consider multi-finger dynamic training. However, additional research with more people with DMD is needed for further generalization of our conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W3003481705,"The SOD3 variant, SOD3R213G, results from substitution of arginine to glycine at amino acid 213 (R213G) in its heparin binding domain (HBD) and is a common genetic variant, reported to be associated with ischemic heart disease. However, little is understood about the role of SOD3R213G in innate immune function, and how it leads to dysfunction of the cardiovascular system. We observed pathologic changes in SOD3R213G transgenic (Tg) mice, including cystic medial degeneration of the aorta, heart inflammation, and increased circulating and organ infiltrating neutrophils. Interestingly, SOD3R213G altered the profile of SOD3 interacting proteins in neutrophils in response to G-CSF. Unexpectedly, we found that G-CSF mediated tyrosine phosphatase, SH-PTP1 was down-regulated in the neutrophils of SOD3R213G overexpressing mice. These effects were recovered by reconstitution with Wt SOD3 expressing bone marrow cells. Overall, our study reveals that SOD3R213G plays a crucial role in the function of the cardiovascular system by controlling innate immune response and signaling. These results suggest that reconstitution with SOD3 expressing bone marrow cells may be a therapeutic strategy to treat SOD3R213G mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3003527726,"Antibiotic resistance is a powerful model for studying evolutionary biology and population genetics. For the purpose of these evolutionary studies, fitness data have been approximated through susceptibility testing methods designed for clinical use in providing appropriate antibiotic therapies. An alternative approach for measuring fitness of microbes has experienced growing popularity: growth rates are a highly sensitive approach for measuring the fitness effects of antibiotics and resistance genes, but they differ from susceptibility testing in that a single concentration of antibiotic is used for the assay. Here we show that despite this key difference, the results of growth rates correlate well with clinical determination of resistance by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), while providing the sensitivity required for direct input as fitness values into mathematical models. This means that growth rates at a single sublethal inhibitory concentration can help us understand the fitness effects that result in clinical antibiotic resistance. By measuring the growth rates of sequenced clinical isolates obtained from Dignity Health Mercy Medical Center, we detected the fitness effects of individual resistance genes on bacteria exposed to different antibiotics. In our study, the CTX-M-15 gene conferred the highest fitness in assays with cephalosporins. These results show the strong fitness benefit conferred by CTX-M-15. Non-technical summary Antibiotic resistance is a global human health problem. We partnered with Dignity Health Mercy Medical Center to study antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates. We tested whether growth rates, a sensitive assay used to measure the fitness of bacterial samples, correlate with a clinical test to measure antibiotic resistance. We found a strong correlation between these two methods suggesting that growth rates could be reliably applied to evolutionary studies of clinically relevant problems. Moreover, the sensitivity of the growth rates assay enabled us to identify fitness effects of specific antibiotic resistance genes."

Shorter interbirth intervals were associated with an increased risk of parental divorce over a ten-year follow-up. Individuals with birth intervals of up to 1.5 years had 24–49 per cent higher divorce risk compared to individuals whose children were born more than 4 years apart. The pattern was similar in all socioeconomic groups and among individuals with earlier and later entry to parenthood.

https://openalex.org/W3004083070,"“Banks won't give a mortgage loan to someone who is only going to be in the country for 1 year,” declared the real estate agent. His remark shocked me. I was a tenure-track faculty member at the time, but I was deemed unworthy to receive a line of credit because of my visa situation. I'm a citizen of the Philippines, and the visa that my U.S. institution obtained for me had to be renewed each year. So, on paper it looked as though I only had permission to be in the country for 1 year. My wife and I encountered many such hurdles because of my visa—and they ultimately drove me to quit my faculty position and leave the country.

> “Don't sign … until you know that you'll have what you need in your new country.” 

In hindsight, I didn't take the visa application process seriously enough when I was negotiating my job offer. I was so excited about landing a tenure-track position that I didn't take time to think through what kind of visa and accommodations I would need to make my personal life work. I also assumed that the university had a system in place to deal with foreign hires. I said yes to the job offer and signed on the dotted line.

The first sign of trouble came when I tried to buy a house in our new city. I had moved there ahead of my wife and 1-year-old daughter so that I could look for a neighborhood where we could settle down. But as the real estate agent predicted, mortgage lenders didn't want to gamble on someone with a 1-year visa. I signed a lease for an apartment instead.

After my wife joined me, we needed a car because our sprawling community didn't have a strong public transportation system. But we had trouble securing credit for that, too. In the end, we had to put down more than $3000 as a down payment.

The third, and final, straw came when my wife wanted to return to her work as a nurse after her maternity leave. Prior to our move, she had obtained a license to practice nursing in the United States. But she couldn't apply for jobs because of legal restrictions associated with my visa. That left her feeling frustrated and isolated, unable to establish a professional life in a new country.

Stress ran high in our small one-bedroom apartment. The logical fix to our problems was for me to secure permanent residency status, otherwise known as a green card. But that just brought more problems. I pleaded with my department chair, dean, and provost to support my green card application. But it took 6 months for the university to agree to sponsor my application, and I didn't know how long the review and approval process would take on top of that.

Exasperated by the entire ordeal, I applied for jobs in countries that I thought would be more supportive of foreign workers and their families. I was offered a faculty job in the Netherlands and, within 3 months, my family and I moved across the Atlantic.

That was 1 year ago, and we've been much happier ever since. My wife, who is allowed to work in the Netherlands, is completing a course toward a nursing certification while our daughter, now 3 years old, is at government-subsidized day care. We are renting a nice house and are looking for one to buy. And we've been helped by a government policy that grants a 30% tax exemption for foreign hires for a period of 5 years.

I'm glad we've ended up where we are. But when I look back, I wish that I'd been more prepared and proactive when negotiating my first faculty position. I could have asked the university to apply for a multiyear visa—which, I later learned, is what human resources staff had done for other faculty hires. I could have also requested a guarantee that the university would sponsor my application for permanent residency within a certain period of time and would pay for some immigration-related expenses, such as green card application fees.

I hope that other immigrant scientists take heed from my tale. If you land a job, don't sign on the dotted line until you know that you'll have what you need in your new country.

https://openalex.org/W3004131013,"Patients diagnosed with coronary heart disease should follow lifestyle recommendations that can reduce their cardiovascular risk (e.g., avoid smoking). However, some patients fail to follow these recommendations and engage in unhealthy behavior. With the aim to identify psychosocial factors that characterize patients at high risk of repeated cardiovascular events, we investigated the relationship between social support, mental health (coping, self-esteem, and perceived stress), and unhealthy behavior. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 419 patients recently diagnosed with coronary heart disease (myocardial infarction or angina) who participated in the National Health Survey in Spain (2018). Unhealthy behaviors were defined according to the European Guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention. Only 1% of patients reported no unhealthy behaviors, with 11% reporting one, 40% two, 35% three, and 13% four or more unhealthy behaviors. In multiple regression controlling for demographic and traditional risk factors, mental health was the only significant psychosocial factor, doubling the odds of accumulated unhealthy behaviors, OR(high vs. low) = 2.03, 95% CI [1.14, 3.64]. Mental health was especially strongly related to unhealthy behavior among patients with obesity, OR(high vs. low) = 3.50, 95% CI [1.49, 8.45]. The relationship between mental health and unhealthy behaviors suggests that a large proportion of patients may not adhere to lifestyle recommendations not because they purposefully choose to do so, but because they lack coping skills to maintain the recommended healthy behaviors. Low mental well-being may be especially detrimental for behavior change of patients with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3004412691,"Although adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) has been established as a standard of treatment for advanced rectal cancer, there is no guideline regarding the timing of AC initiation. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the oncologic outcome of early AC initiation and clarify the ideal time to AC among rectal cancer patients receiving preoperative chemo-radiotherapy (preCRT).The medical records of 719 patients who underwent curative resection followed by AC for rectal cancer were analyzed retrospectively. Data distributions were compared according to the calculated cut-off for AC initiation, survival results, and chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Additionally, patients were divided into two groups according to preCRT status and compared with respect to differences in the optimal time to AC.Overall, a cut-off time point of 20 days after surgery for AC initiation was identified as the optimal interval; this yielded a significant difference in disease-free survival but no significant difference in AC toxicity. In the cut-off analysis of patients treated without preCRT, 19 days was identified as the optimal time to AC. However, for patients treated with preCRT, no significant value affected the survival outcome.Earlier initiation of AC (within approximately 3 weeks) was associated with better oncological outcomes among patients with rectal cancer. Additionally, the optimal timing of AC was unclear among patients who received preCRT; this might be attributable to an undetermined role of AC after preCRT or the effects of complications such as anastomotic leakage."

OCT of the culprit vessel to determine the plaque type was performed in a subset of patients. Functional relevance of all lesions was examined using quantitative flow reserve (QFR-angiography). Hemodynamically significant lesions were defined as lesions with a QFR <0.8. Signal intensity (contrast-to-noise ratios; CNRs) on native T1-weighted CMR and gadofosveset-enhanced CMR was defined as a measure for intraplaque hemorrhage and endothelial permeability, respectively.Overall 29 coronary segments from 14 patients were examined. Segments containing lesions with a QFR <0.8 (n = 9) were associated with significantly higher signal enhancement on Gadofosveset-enhanced CMR as compared to segments containing a lesions without significant stenosis (lesion-QFR>0.8; n = 19) (5.32 (4.47-7.02) vs. 2.42 (1.04-5.11); p = 0.042). No differences in signal enhancement were seen on native T1-weighted CMR (2.2 (0.68-6.75) vs. 2.09 (0.91-6.57), p = 0.412). 66.7% (4 out of 6) of all vulnerable plaque and 33.3% (2 out of 6) of all non-vulnerable plaque (fibroatheroma) as assessed by OCT were hemodynamically significant lesions.The findings of this pilot study suggest that signal enhancement on albumin-binding probe-enhanced CMR but not on T1-weighted CMR is associated with hemodynamically relevant coronary lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3004261392,"Over the past decades, brain imaging studies in fluently speaking participants have greatly advanced our knowledge of the brain areas involved in speech production. In addition, complementary information has been provided by investigations of brain activation patterns associated with disordered speech. In the present study we specifically aimed to revisit and expand an earlier study by De Nil and colleagues, by investigating the effects of simulating disfluencies on the brain activation patterns of fluent speakers during overt and covert speech production. In contrast to the De Nil et al. study, the current findings show that the production of voluntary, self-generated disfluencies by fluent speakers resulted in increased recruitment and activation of brain areas involved in speech production. These areas show substantial overlap with the neural networks involved in motor sequence learning in general, and learning of speech production, in particular. The implications of these findings for the interpretation of brain imaging studies on disordered and non-habitual speech production are discussed."
