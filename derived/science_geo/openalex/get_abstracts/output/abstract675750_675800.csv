https://openalex.org/W3167129132,"SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen-specific IgG and IgA elicited by infection mediate viral neutralization and are likely an important component of natural immunity, however, limited information exists on vaccine induced responses. We measured COVID-19 mRNA vaccine induced IgG and IgA in serum serially, up to 145 days post vaccination in 4 subjects. Spike antigen-specific IgG levels rose exponentially and plateaued 21 days after the initial vaccine dose. After the second vaccine dose IgG levels increased further, reaching a maximum approximately 7–10 days later, and remained elevated (average of 58% peak levels) during the additional &gt;100 day follow up period. COVID-19 mRNA vaccination elicited spike antigen-specific IgA with similar kinetics of induction and time to peak levels, but more rapid decline in serum levels following both the 1 st and 2 nd vaccine doses (&lt;18% peak levels within 100 days of the 2 nd shot). The data demonstrate COVID-19 mRNA vaccines effectively induce spike antigen specific IgG and IgA and highlight marked differences in their persistence in serum."

This is a site of rich exposure to antigens and commensals, and a tissue susceptible to one of the most prevalent human inflammatory diseases, periodontitis. To aid in understanding tissue-specific pathophysiology, we compile a single-cell transcriptome atlas of human oral mucosa in healthy individuals and patients with periodontitis. We uncover the complex cellular landscape of oral mucosal tissues and identify epithelial and stromal cell populations with inflammatory signatures that promote antimicrobial defenses and neutrophil recruitment. Our findings link exaggerated stromal cell responsiveness with enhanced neutrophil and leukocyte infiltration in periodontitis. Our work provides a resource characterizing the role of tissue stroma in regulating mucosal tissue homeostasis and disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3168111723,"AXIN2 and LGR5 mark intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that require WNT/β-Catenin signaling for constant homeostatic proliferation. In contrast, AXIN2/LGR5+ pericentral hepatocytes show low proliferation rates despite a WNT/β-Catenin activity gradient required for metabolic liver zonation. The mechanisms restricting proliferation in AXIN2+ hepatocytes and metabolic gene expression in AXIN2+ ISCs remained elusive. We now show that restricted chromatin accessibility in ISCs prevents the expression of β-Catenin-regulated metabolic enzymes, whereas fine-tuning of WNT/β-Catenin activity by ZNRF3 and RNF43 restricts proliferation in chromatin-permissive AXIN2+ hepatocytes, while preserving metabolic function. ZNRF3 deletion promotes hepatocyte proliferation, which in turn becomes limited by RNF43 upregulation. Concomitant deletion of RNF43 in ZNRF3 mutant mice results in metabolic reprogramming of periportal hepatocytes and induces clonal expansion in a subset of hepatocytes, ultimately promoting liver tumors. Together, ZNRF3 and RNF43 cooperate to safeguard liver homeostasis by spatially and temporally restricting WNT/β-Catenin activity, balancing metabolic function and hepatocyte proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W3169614482,"Many recent disease outbreaks in humans had a zoonotic virus etiology. Bats in particular have been recognized as reservoirs to a large variety of viruses with the potential to cross-species transmission. In order to assess the risk of bats in Switzerland for such transmissions, we determined the virome of tissue and fecal samples of 14 native and 4 migrating bat species. In total, sequences belonging to 39 different virus families, 16 of which are known to infect vertebrates, were detected. Contigs of coronaviruses, adenoviruses, hepeviruses, rotaviruses A and H, and parvoviruses with potential zoonotic risk were characterized in more detail. Most interestingly, in a ground stool sample of a Vespertilio murinus colony an almost complete genome of a Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was detected by Next generation sequencing and confirmed by PCR. In conclusion, bats in Switzerland naturally harbour many different viruses. Metagenomic analyses of non-invasive samples like ground stool may support effective surveillance and early detection of viral zoonoses."

There has been limited research to understand the consequences of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations in West Africa, and whether such consequences differ by countries’ previous experience with Ebola. Using a media analysis of leading online news sources, this study identified the populations particularly vulnerable to the threats of the COVID-19 pandemic, described the consequences of COVID-19 experienced by these populations, and reported on the solutions to address them. All articles from the selected news sources published between January 1 and June 30, 2020 on 6 West African countries were imported into Dedoose. A total of 4,388 news articles were coded for excerpts on vulnerable populations, only 285 excerpts of which mentioned the existing effects of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations or implemented solutions. News articles from countries with past experience with Ebola were more likely to mention the pandemic’s effects on vulnerable populations, especially on incarcerated people. Vulnerable groups were reported to have experienced a range of effects including economic disruptions, heightened domestic and sexual abuse, arbitrary arrests, health care inaccessibility, and educational challenges throughout the pandemic. With implications for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for 2030 in West Africa, these countries should consider and focus more strategic efforts on vulnerable populations to overcome their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and to achieve the SDG for 2030."

https://openalex.org/W3167205745,"Hypertension is associated with excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in vascular cells. Mitochondria undergo fusion and fission, a process playing a role in mitochondrial function. OPA1 is essential for mitochondrial fusion. Loss of OPA1 is associated with ROS production and cell dysfunction. We hypothesized that mitochondria fusion could reduce oxidative stress that defect in fusion would exacerbate hypertension. Using (a) Opa1 haploinsufficiency in isolated resistance arteries from Opa1+/− mice, (b) primary vascular cells from Opa1+/− mice, and (c) RNA interference experiments with siRNA against Opa1 in vascular cells, we investigated the role of mitochondria fusion in hypertension. In hypertension, Opa1 haploinsufficiency induced altered mitochondrial cristae structure both in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells but did not modify protein level of long and short forms of OPA1. In addition, we demonstrated an increase of mitochondrial ROS production, associated with a decrease of superoxide dismutase 1 protein expression. We also observed an increase of apoptosis in vascular cells and a decreased VSMCs proliferation. Blood pressure, vascular contractility, as well as endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation were similar in Opa1+/−, WT, L-NAME-treated Opa1+/− and WT mice. Nevertheless, chronic NO-synthase inhibition with L-NAME induced a greater hypertension in Opa1+/− than in WT mice without compensatory arterial wall hypertrophy. This was associated with a stronger reduction in endothelium-dependent relaxation due to excessive ROS production. Our results highlight the protective role of mitochondria fusion in the vasculature during hypertension by limiting mitochondria ROS production."
https://openalex.org/W3167912762,"The use of face masks by the general population during viral outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic, although at times controversial, has been effective in slowing down the spread of the virus. The extent to which face masks mitigate the transmission is highly dependent on how well the mask fits each individual. The fit of simple cloth masks on the face, as well as the resulting perimeter leakage and face mask efficacy, are expected to be highly dependent on the type of mask and facial topology. However, this effect has, to date, not been adequately examined and quantified. Here, we propose a framework to study the efficacy of different mask designs based on a quasi-static mechanical model of the deployment of face masks onto a wide range of faces. To illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework, we explore a simple rectangular cloth mask on a large virtual population of subjects generated from a 3D morphable face model. The effect of weight, age, gender, and height on the mask fit is studied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended homemade cloth mask design was used as a basis for comparison and was found not to be the most effective design for all subjects. We highlight the importance of designing masks accounting for the widely varying population of faces. Metrics based on aerodynamic principles were used to determine that thin, feminine, and young faces were shown to benefit from mask sizes smaller than that recommended by the CDC. Besides mask size, side-edge tuck-in, or pleating, of the masks as a design parameter was also studied and found to have the potential to cause a larger localized gap opening."
https://openalex.org/W3110009080,"The global pandemic of COVID-19 poses a huge threat to the health and lives of people all over the world, and brings unprecedented pressure to the medical system. We need to establish a practical method to improve the efficiency of treatment and optimize the allocation of medical resources. Due to the influx of a large number of patients into the hospital and the running of medical resources, blood routine test became the only possible check while COVID-19 patients first go to a fever clinic in a community hospital. This study aims to establish an efficient method to identify key indicators from initial blood routine test results for COVID-19 severity prediction. We determined that age is a key indicator for severity predicting of COVID-19, with an accuracy of 0.77 and an AUC of 0.92. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction, we proposed a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) algorithm, which combines the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier, to further select effective indicators from patients’ initial blood test results. The MCDM algorithm selected 3 dominant feature subsets: {Age, WBC, LYMC, NEUT} with a selection rate of 44%, {Age, NEUT, LYMC} with a selection rate of 38%, and {Age, WBC, LYMC} with a selection rate of 9%. Using these feature subsets, the optimized prediction model could achieve an accuracy of 0.82 and an AUC of 0.93. These results indicated that Age, WBC, LYMC, NEUT were the key factors for COVID-19 severity prediction. Using age and the indicators selected by the MCDM algorithm from initial blood routine test results can effectively predict the severity of COVID-19. Our research could not only help medical workers identify patients with severe COVID-19 at an early stage, but also help doctors understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 through key indicators."
https://openalex.org/W3169985063,"We aimed to examine whether the use of aspirin is associated with change in cognitive performance over time, and whether this association is modified by the cognitive stages. This study included a total of 1866 subjects, including 509 subjects with normal cognition (NC), 985 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 372 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In each group, we further categorized our subjects into two groups based on their aspirin using conditions: Aspirin users and non-aspirin users. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was the cognitive outcome. Linear mixed models were conducted to examine the longitudinal relationship between the use of aspirin and cognitive performance in each diagnostic group. In the cross-sectional analysis, there were no significant differences in MMSE scores between non-aspirin users and aspirin users in subjects with NC, subjects with MCI or patients with AD. In the longitudinal analysis, we detected an association of the baseline use of aspirin with cognitive decline (MMSE) over time in patients with AD, but not in the NC group or MCI group. Specifically, in AD patients, the use of aspirin at baseline was associated with slower cognitive decline over time. Our data may support an association between the use of aspirin and slower cognitive decline, while this association may be dependent on the clinical stages."
https://openalex.org/W3172116721,"Abstract Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key regulatory roles in breast cancer. However, population-level differential expression analysis methods disregard the heterogeneous expression of lncRNAs in individual patients. Therefore, we individualized lncRNA expression profiles for breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) using the method of LncRNA Individualization ( LncRIndiv ). After evaluating the robustness of LncRIndiv , we constructed an individualized differentially expressed lncRNA (IDElncRNA) profile for BRCA and investigated the subtype-specific IDElncRNAs. The breast cancer subtype-specific IDElncRNA showed frequent co-occurrence with alterations of protein-coding genes, including mutations, copy number variation and differential methylation. We performed hierarchical clustering to subdivide TNBC and revealed mesenchymal subtype and immune subtype for TNBC. The TNBC immune subtype showed a better prognosis than the TNBC mesenchymal subtype. LncRNA PTOV1-AS1 was the top differentially expressed lncRNA in the mesenchymal subtype. And biological experiments validated that the upregulation of PTOV1-AS1 could downregulate TJP1 (ZO-1) and E-Cadherin, and upregulate Vimentin, which suggests PTOV1-AS1 may promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition and lead to migration and invasion of TNBC cells. The mesenchymal subtype showed a higher fraction of M2 macrophages, whereas the immune subtype was more associated with CD4 + T cells. The immune subtype is characterized by genomic instability and upregulation of immune checkpoint genes, thereby suggesting a potential response to immunosuppressive drugs. Last, drug response analysis revealed lncRNA ENSG00000230082 ( PRRT3-AS1 ) is a potential resistance biomarker for paclitaxel in BRCA treatment. Our analysis highlights that IDElncRNAs can characterize inter-tumor heterogeneity in BRCA and the new TNBC subtypes indicate novel insights into TNBC immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3170229999,"Background Subgroups of precarious populations such as homeless people are more exposed to infection and at higher risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 compared to the general population. Many of the recommended prevention measures, such as social distancing and self-isolation, are not feasible for a population living in shelters characterised by physical proximity and a high population density. The objective of the study was to describe SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence in homeless shelters in Brussels (Belgium), and to identify risk factors and infection control practices associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. Methods A total of 1994 adults were tested by quantitative PCR tests in 52 shelters in Brussels (Belgium) between April and June, 2020, in collaboration with Doctors of the World. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is here described site by site, and we identify risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. We also investigate associations between seropositivity and reported symptoms. Results We found an overall prevalence of 4.6% for the period, and a cluster of high rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity (20–30% in two shelters). Among homeless people, being under 40 years of age (OR (CI95%) 2.3 (1.2–4.4), p = 0.02), having access to urgent medical care (AMU) (OR(CI95%): 2.4 (1.4–4.4)], p = 0.02), and sharing a room with someone who tested positive (OR(CI95%): 5.3 (2.9–9.9), p&lt;0.0001) were factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. 93% of those who tested positive were asymptomatic. Conclusion This study shows high rates of SARS-COV-2 infection positive tests in some shelters, with a high proportion of asymptomatic cases. The survey reveals how important testing and isolation measures are, together with actions taken by medical and social workers during the outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3172772184,"Light improves mood. The amygdala plays a critical role in regulating emotion, including fear-related responses. In rodents the amygdala receives direct light input from the retina, and light may play a role in fear-related learning. A direct effect of light on the amygdala represents a plausible mechanism of action for light's mood-elevating effects in humans. However, the effect of light on activity in the amygdala in humans is not well understood. We examined the effect of passive dim-to-moderate white light exposure on activation of the amygdala in healthy young adults using the BOLD fMRI response (3T Siemens scanner; n = 23). Participants were exposed to alternating 30s blocks of light (10 lux or 100 lux) and dark (<1 lux), with each light intensity being presented separately. Light, compared with dark, suppressed activity in the amygdala. Moderate light exposure resulted in greater suppression of amygdala activity than dim light. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventro-medial prefrontal cortex was enhanced during light relative to dark. These effects may contribute to light's mood-elevating effects, via a reduction in negative, fear-related affect and enhanced processing of negative emotion."
https://openalex.org/W3170199623,"The pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), has been suggested to be a key factor in the induction of obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction. However, the role that macrophage-derived TNF-α has on regulating metabolic perturbations in obesity is not completely understood. Therefore, we utilized the TNF-αFlox/Flox (F/F), LyzMcre± mouse model to determine the impact that macrophage TNF-α deletion has on the development of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. At 10 weeks of age, male littermates were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: TNF-αF/F low-fat diet (TNF-αF/F LFD), TNF-αF/F, LyzMCre LFD, TNF-αF/F HFD, or TNF-αF/F, LyzMCre HFD (n = 16-28/group) and were fed their respective diets for 18 weeks. Body weight was assessed throughout the course of the experiment. Body composition, hepatic lipid accumulation, and metabolic outcomes were also examined. A microarray gene expression experiment was performed from RNA isolated from epididymal adipose tissue of the HFD-fed groups (n = 10/group) and results were verified via qRT-PCR for all groups. Macrophage-derived TNF-α deletion significantly reduced adipose tissue TNF-α gene expression and circulating TNF-α and downregulated genes linked to the toll-like receptor (TLR) and NFκB signaling pathways. However, macrophage TNF-α deletion had no effect on hindering the development of obesity, hepatic lipid accumulation, or improving glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, macrophage-derived TNF-α is not a causative factor for the induction of obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction."

https://openalex.org/W3168757391,"Underwater video monitoring systems are being widely used in fisheries to investigate fish behavior in relation to fishing gear and fishing gear performance during fishing. Such systems can be useful to evaluate the catch composition as well. In demersal trawl fisheries, however, their applicability can be challenged by low light conditions, mobilized sediment and scattering in murky waters. In this study, we introduce a novel observation system (called NepCon) which aims at reducing current limitations by combining an optimized image acquisition setup and tailored image analyses software. The NepCon system includes a high-contrast background to enhance the visibility of the target objects, a compact camera and an artificial light source. The image analysis software includes a machine learning algorithm which is evaluated here to test automatic detection and count of Norway lobster ( Nephrops norvegicus) . NepCon is specifically designed for applications in demersal trawls and this first phase aims at increasing the accuracy of N . norvegicus detection at the data acquisition level. To find the best contrasting background for the purpose we compared the output of four image segmentation methods applied to static images of N . norvegicus fixed in front of four test background colors. The background color with the best performance was then used to evaluate computer vision and deep learning approaches for automatic detection, tracking and counting of N . norvegicus in the videos. In this initial phase we tested the system in an experimental setting to understand the feasibility of the system for future implementation in real demersal fishing conditions. The N . norvegicus directed trawl fishery typically has no assistance from underwater observation technology and therefore are largely conducted blindly. The demonstrated perception system achieves 76% accuracy (F-score) in automatic detection and count of N . norvegicus , which provides a significant elevation of the current benchmark."

Consequently, the development of technically efficient and economically affordable alternatives as, e.g., biological control agents or practices is highly solicited. Crown gall disease of dicotyledonous plants is caused by ubiquitous soil borne pathogenic bacteria of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens species complex, that comprises the species Agrobacterium fabrum and represents a globally relevant plant protection problem. Within the framework of a screening program for bacterial Agrobacterium antagonists a total of 14 strains were isolated from Tunisian soil samples and assayed for antagonistic activity against pathogenic agrobacteria. One particularly promising isolate, termed strain MBY2, was studied more in depth. Using a Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) approach, the isolate was assigned to the taxonomic species Bacillus velezensis. Strain MBY2 was shown to display antagonistic effects against the pathogenic A. fabrum strain C58 in vitro and to significantly decrease pathogen populations under sterile and non-sterile soil conditions as well as in the rhizosphere of maize and, to a lower extent, tomato plants. Moreover, the ability of B. velezensis MBY2 to reduce C58-induced gall development has been demonstrated in vivo on stems of tomato and almond plants. The present study describes B. velezensis MBY2 as a newly discovered strain holding potential as a biological agent for crown gall disease management."

Therefore, the need to assess the influence of nomophobia within the student population in Ghana. This descriptive cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of nomophobia and the sociodemographic variables, and the association with academic achievement of the understudied population. A self-reporting nomophobia questionnaire, composed of 20 dimensions, was answered by 670 university students to measure the nomophobia prevalence. Raw data were estimated using descriptive statistics, and one-way ANOVA and Independent T-test. While the findings showed diverse grades of nomophobia, statistical significance between academic achievement and the level of nomophobia was observed. This study concludes that there is a high nomophobia prevalence among university students in Ghana as the use of smartphones increases. However, follow-up studies should be conducted in Ghanaian universities to monitor nomophobia and its associates in order to reduce the adverse effects of habitual use of smartphones."
https://openalex.org/W3168370115,"Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are mediators of normal intercellular communication, but exosomes are also used by tumor cells to promote oncogenesis and metastasis. Complement factor H (CFH) protects host cells from attack and destruction by the alternative pathway of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Here we show that CFH can protect exosomes from complement-mediated lysis and phagocytosis. CFH was found to be associated with EVs from a variety of tumor cell lines as well as EVs isolated from the plasma of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Higher levels of CFH-containing EVs correlated with higher metastatic potential of cell lines. GT103, a previously described antibody to CFH that preferentially causes CDC of tumor cells, was used to probe the susceptibility of tumor cell-derived exosomes to destruction. Exosomes were purified from EVs using CD63 beads. Incubation of GT103 with tumor cell-derived exosomes triggered exosome lysis primarily by the classical complement pathway as well as antibody-dependent exosome phagocytosis by macrophages. These results imply that GT103-mediated exosome destruction can be triggered by antibody Fc-C1q interaction (in the case of lysis), and antibody-Fc receptor interactions (in the case of phagocytosis). Thus, this work demonstrates CFH is expressed on tumor cell derived exosomes, can protect them from complement lysis and phagocytosis, and that an anti-CFH antibody can be used to target tumor-derived exosomes for exosome destruction via innate immune mechanisms. These findings suggest that a therapeutic CFH antibody has the potential to inhibit tumor progression and reduce metastasis promoted by exosomes."
https://openalex.org/W3166149382,"The p-value has been debated exorbitantly in the last decades, experiencing fierce critique, but also finding some advocates. The fundamental issue with its misleading interpretation stems from its common use for testing the unrealistic null hypothesis of an effect that is precisely zero. A meaningful question asks instead whether the effect is relevant. It is then unavoidable that a threshold for relevance is chosen. Considerations that can lead to agreeable conventions for this choice are presented for several commonly used statistical situations. Based on the threshold, a simple quantitative measure of relevance emerges naturally. Statistical inference for the effect should be based on the confidence interval for the relevance measure. A classification of results that goes beyond a simple distinction like ""significant / non-significant"" is proposed. On the other hand, if desired, a single number called the ""secured relevance"" may summarize the result, like the p-value does it, but with a scientifically meaningful interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W3167618299,"Bacillus cereus is a foodborne pathogen and can form biofilms on food contact surfaces, which causes food hygiene problems. While it is necessary to understand strain-dependent variation to effectively control these biofilms, strain-to-strain variation in the structure of B. cereus biofilms is poorly understood. In this study, B. cereus strains from tatsoi (BC4, BC10, and BC72) and the ATCC 10987 reference strain were incubated at 30°C to form biofilms in the presence of the extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes DNase I, proteinase K, dispase II, cellulase, amyloglucosidase, and α-amylase to assess the susceptibility to these enzymes. The four strains exhibited four different patterns in terms of biofilm susceptibility to the enzymes as well as morphology of surface-attached biofilms or suspended cell aggregates. DNase I inhibited the biofilm formation of strains ATCC 10987 and BC4 but not of strains BC10 and BC72. This result suggests that some strains may not have extracellular DNA, or their extracellular DNA may be protected in their biofilms. In addition, the strains exhibited different patterns of susceptibility to protein- and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes. While other strains were resistant, strains ATCC 10987 and BC4 were susceptible to cellulase, suggesting that cellulose or its similar polysaccharides may exist and play an essential role in their biofilm formation. Our compositional and imaging analyses of strains ATCC 10987 and BC4 suggested that the physicochemical properties of their biofilms are distinct, as calculated by the carbohydrate to protein ratio. Taken together, our study suggests that the extracellular matrix of B. cereus biofilms may be highly diverse and provides insight into the diverse mechanisms of biofilm formation among B. cereus strains."
https://openalex.org/W3170384202,"To estimate the proportion of men and women aged 50 years and older who would be classified as ""high risk"" for fracture and eligible for anti-fracture treatment.The study involved 1421 women and 652 men aged 50 years and older, who were recruited from the general population in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Fracture history was ascertained from each individual. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck by DXA (Hologic Horizon). The diagnosis of osteoporosis was based on the T-scores ≤ -2.50 derived from either femoral neck or lumbar spine BMD. The 10-year risks of major fractureand hip fracture were estimated from FRAX version for Thai population. The criteria for recommended treatment were based on the US National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF).The average age of women and men was ~60 yr (SD 7.8). Approximately 11% (n = 152) of women and 14% (n = 92) of men had a prior fracture. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 27% (n = 381; 95% CI, 25 to 29%) in women and 13% (n = 87; 95% CI, 11 to 16%) in men. Only 1% (n = 11) of women and 0.1% (n = 1) of men had 10-year risk of major fracture ≥ 20%. However, 23% (n = 327) of women and 9.5% (n = 62) of men had 10-year risk of hip fracture ≥ 3%. Using the NOF recommended criteria, 49% (n = 702; 95% CI, 47 to 52%) of women and 35% (n = 228; 95% CI, 31 to 39%) of men would be eligible for therapy.Almost half of women and just over one-third of men aged 50 years and older in Vietnam meet the NOF criteria for osteoporosis treatment. This finding can help develop guidelines for osteoporosis treatment in Vietnam."
https://openalex.org/W3170982375,"Religion and spirituality play important roles in the lives of many, including healthcare providers and their patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between religion, spirituality, and cultural competence of healthcare providers.Physicians, residents, and medical students were recruited through social platforms to complete an electronically delivered survey, gathering data regarding demographics, cultural competency, religiosity, and spirituality. Four composite variables were created to categorize cultural competency: Patient Care Knowledge, Patient Care Skills/Abilities, Professional Interactions, and Systems Level Interactions. Study participants (n = 144) were grouped as Christian (n = 95)/non-Christian (n = 49) and highly religious (n = 62)/not highly religious (n = 82); each group received a score in the four categories. Wilcoxon rank sum and Chi-square tests were used for analysis of continuous and discrete variables.A total of 144 individuals completed the survey with the majority having completed medical school (n = 87), identifying as women (n = 108), white (n = 85), Christian (n = 95), and not highly religious (n = 82). There were no significant differences amongst Christian versus non-Christian groups or highly religious versus not highly religious groups when comparing their patient care knowledge (p = .563, p = .457), skills/abilities (p = .423, p = .51), professional interactions (p = .191, p = .439), or systems level interaction scores (p = .809, p = .078). Nevertheless, participants reported decreased knowledge of different healing traditions (90%) and decreased skills inquiring about religious/spiritual and cultural beliefs that may affect patient care (91% and 88%). Providers also reported rarely referring patients to religious services (86%).Although this study demonstrated no significant impact of healthcare providers' religious/spiritual beliefs on the ability to deliver culturally competent care, it did reveal gaps around how religion and spirituality interact with health and healthcare. This suggests a need for improved cultural competence education."
https://openalex.org/W3166479552,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that recently caused a major epidemic in the Americas. Although the majority of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, the virus has been associated with birth defects in fetuses and newborns of infected mothers as well as neurological complications in adults. We performed a descriptive analysis on approximately 106,000 suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika virus disease (ZVD) that were reported during the 2015-2017 epidemic in Colombia. We also analyzed a dataset containing patients with neurological complications and recent febrile illness compatible with ZVD. Females had higher cumulative incidence of ZVD than males. Compared to the general population, cases were more likely to be reported in young adults (20 to 39 years of age). We estimated the cumulative incidence of ZVD in pregnant females at 3,120 reported cases per 100,000 population (95% CI: 3,077-3,164), which was considerably higher than the incidence in both males and non-pregnant females. ZVD cases were reported in all 32 departments. Four-hundred and eighteen patients suffered from ZIKV-associated neurological complications, of which 85% were diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome. The median age of ZIKV cases with neurological complications was 12 years older than that of ZVD cases. ZIKV-associated neurological complications increased with age, and the highest incidence was reported among individuals aged 75 and older. Even though neurological complications and deaths due to ZIKV were rare in this epidemic, better risk communication is needed for people living in or traveling to ZIKV-affected areas."
https://openalex.org/W3167194600,"Objective The discrepancy between admission and discharge diagnosis can lead to possible adverse patient outcomes. There are gaps in integrated studies, and less is understood about its characteristics and effects. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the frequency, characteristics, and outcomes of diagnostic discrepancies at admission and discharge. Design and data sources This retrospective study reviewed the admitting and discharge diagnoses of adult patients admitted at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Internal Medicine Department between October 2018 and February 2019. The frequency and outcomes of discrepancies in patient diagnoses were noted among Emergency Department (ED) physician versus admitting physician, admitting physician versus discharge physician, and ED physician versus discharge physician for the full match, partial match, and mismatch diagnoses. The studied outcomes included interdepartmental transfer, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) transfer, in-hospital mortality, readmission within 30 days, and the length of stay. For simplicity, we only analyzed the factors for the discrepancy among ED physicians and discharge physicians. Results Out of 537 admissions, there were 25.3–27.2% admissions with full match diagnoses while 18.6–19.4% and 45.3–47.9% had mismatch and partial match diagnoses respectively. The discrepancy resulted in an increased number of interdepartmental transfers (5–5.8%), ICU transfers (5.6–8.7%), in-hospital mortality (8–11%), and readmissions within 30 days in ED (14.4%-16.7%). A statistically significant difference was observed for the ward’s length of stay with the most prolonged stay in partially matched diagnoses (6.3 ± 5.4 days). Among all the factors that were evaluated for the diagnostic discrepancy, older age, multi-morbidities, level of trainee clerking the patient, review by ED faculty, incomplete history, and delay in investigations at ED were associated with significant discrepant diagnoses. Conclusions Diagnostic discrepancies are a relevant and significant healthcare problem. Fixed patient or physician characteristics do not readily predict diagnostic discrepancies. To reduce the diagnostic discrepancy, emphasis should be given to good history taking and thorough physical examination. Patients with older age and multi-morbidity should receive significant consideration."
https://openalex.org/W3169783410,"Previous empirical evidence suggests that the engagement in social interactions across different everyday contexts occurs in a manner highly responsive to a person's social affiliation needs. As has been shown repeatedly, social engagement (as well as disengagement) can be predicted from earlier situational need states, implying that homeostatic principles underlie a person's social affiliative behaviors. However, little is known about the role of emotion in these regulative processes. For this reason, the present exploratory study investigated the predictive role of state feelings of loneliness in subsequent engagement in social interaction. Since loneliness is conceptually associated with both the need to reaffiliate as well as self-protecting tendencies potentially hindering engagement in social contact, the study investigated the possibility of both increases and decreases in social contacts resulting from state feelings of loneliness. Adopting an experience sampling methodology (ESM), a sample of 65 participants was recruited from a local university and was followed for 14 days. Subjects were prompted several times a day to rate their feeling states and the quantity of social interactions, using a fixed interval assessment schedule. Statistical analyses using multilevel analysis indicated that state feelings of loneliness had complex quadratic effects upon subsequent social interaction, leading to both increases and decreases in subsequent social interaction. Moreover, these effects were contingent upon previous engagement in social interaction, implying spillover effects across social contexts that are conditionally mediated by feelings of loneliness. These findings clearly imply an important, albeit complex role of state feelings of loneliness in the regulation of social affiliation, both as a predictor and a consequence of social interaction. These exploratory findings are discussed against the background of methodological and conceptual limitations, and several recommendations for future studies are made."
https://openalex.org/W3170385149,"In current research, the hydraulic performance prediction and optimization of an engine cooling water pump was conducted by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. Through CFD simulation, the pump head, shaft power and efficiency for the original pump at volume flow rate 25 L/min and impeller rotating speed 4231 r/min were 3.87 m, 66.7 W and 23.09% respectively. For improving hydraulic performance, an optimization study was carried out. After optimization, four potential optimized designs were put forward. The efficiency of the optimized design No.1 for engine cooling water pump was nearly 6% higher than that of the original pump model; and the head of the optimized design No.2 for engine cooling water pump was 9% higher than that of the original pump model. Under the condition of maintaining the pump head and considering comprehensive improvement effect, the optimized design No.3 was considered as the best design and selected as the test case for validating the optimum design. The hydraulic performance predictions for this optimum engine cooling water pump agreed well with experimental data at design condition with relative discrepancies of 2.9% and 5.5% for the pump head and pump efficiency, respectively. It proved that performance prediction calculation model and the automatic optimization model were effective. This research work can provide theoretical basis for the design, development and optimization of engine cooling water pump."

The SpectrumTM app provides antibiotic decision support, based on local antimicrobial resistance rates. We determined the impact of regional implementation of the app on inpatient antimicrobial appropriateness, inpatient antimicrobial usage (AMU), population-based Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) rates and cost, using a retrospective, before and after quasi-experimental design, including a one-year study period.The SpectrumTM app was released to prescribers in February, 2019. We performed two one-day inpatient point prevalence surveys using the National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey tool, six months before (June 25, 2018) and six months after (June 25, 2019) app dissemination. Inpatient AMU in Defined Daily Dose/1000 patient days and CDI incidence were compared, before and after app dissemination.The pre-survey included 184 prescriptions, and the post-survey included 197 prescriptions. Appropriateness was 97/176 (55.1%) pre, and 126/192 (65.6%) post (+10.5%, p = 0.051). Inpatient AMU declined by 6.6 DDD/1000 patient days per month, and CDI declined by 0.3 cases per month. Cost savings associated with reduced AMU were $403.98/bed/year and associated with reduced CDI were $82,078/year.We observed improvement in antimicrobial stewardship indicators following SpectrumTM implementation. We cannot determine the cause of these improvements."
https://openalex.org/W3172649413,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder with chronic hyperglycemia featured by metabolic outcomes owing to insufficient insulin secretion and/or insulin effect defect. It is critical to investigate new therapeutic approaches for T2DM and alternative, natural agents that target molecules in potential signal pathways. Medicinal plants are significant resources in the research of alternative new drug active ingredients. Bolanthus spergulifolius (B. spergulifolius) is one of the genera of the family Caryophyllaceae. In this study, it was explored the potential anti-diabetic effects in vitro of B. spergulifolius extracts on 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The total phenolic contents (TPC) of methanolic (MeOH), ethyl acettate (EA) and aqueous extracts of B. spergulifolius were evaluated via Folin-Ciocateau. B. spergulifolius extracts showing highly TPC (Aqueous< MeOH< EA) and their different concentrations were carried out on preadipocytes differentiated in to mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes to investigate their half-maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC50) value by using Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The IC50 of MeOH, EA and Aqueous extracts were observed as 305.7 ± 5.583 μg/mL, 567.4 ± 3.008 μg/mL, and 418.3 ± 4.390 μg/mL and used for further experiments. A live/dead assay further confirmed the cytotoxic effects of MeOH, EA and Aqueous extracts (respectively, 69.75 ± 1.70%, 61.75 ± 1.70%, 70 ± 4.24%, and for all p< 0.05). Also, effects of extracts on lipid accumulation in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were evaluated by Oil-Red O staining assay. The extracts effectively decreased lipid-accumulation compared to untreated adipocytes (for all p< 0.05). Moreover, effect of extracts on apoptosis regulated by the Bax and Bcl-2 was investigated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The extracts significantly induced apoptosis by up-regulating pro-apoptotic Bax expression but down-regulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene expression compared to untreated adipocytes (for all p< 0.05). The Glut-4 expression linked with insulin resistance was determined by qRT-PCR, Western-blot analysis, and immunofluorescence staining. In parallel, the expression of Glut-4 in adipocytes treated with extracts was significantly higher compared to untreated adipocytes (for all p< 0.05). Extracts significantly suppressed cell migration after 30 h of wounding in a scratch-assay (for all p< 0.05). Cell morphology and diameter were further evaluated by phase-contrast microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Immunofluorescence with F-Actin and Giemsa staining. The adipocytes treated with extracts partially lost spherical morphology and showed smaller cell-diameter compared to untreated adipocytes (for all p< 0.05). In conclusion, these results suggest that extracts of B. spergulifolius cause to an induce apoptosis, decrease lipid-accumulation, wound healing, up-regulating Glut-4 level and might contribute to reducing of insulin-resistance in DM."
https://openalex.org/W3167803761,"Bone marrow derived human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) are an attractive candidate for regenerative medicine. However, their harvest can be invasive, painful, and expensive, making it difficult to supply the enormous amount of pure hMSCs needed for future allogeneic therapies. Because of this, a robust method of scaled bioreactor culture must be designed to supply the need for high purity, high density hMSC yields. Here we test a scaled down model of a novel bioreactor consisting of an unsubmerged 3D printed Polylactic Acid (PLA) lattice matrix wetted by culture media. The growth matrix is uniform, replicable, and biocompatible, enabling homogenous cell culture in three dimensions. The goal of this study was to prove that hMSCs would culture well in this novel bioreactor design. The system tested resulted in comparable stem cell yields to other cell culture systems using bone marrow derived hMSCs, while maintaining viability (96.54% ±2.82), high purity (>98% expression of combined positive markers), and differentiation potential."
https://openalex.org/W3170125341,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes several endopeptidases, including elastase, alkaline proteinase (Apr), a lysine-specific endopeptidase (LysC), and an aminopeptidase (PaAP), all of which are important virulence factors. Activation of the endopeptidases requires removal of an inhibitory N-terminal propeptide. Activation of pro-PaAP, in contrast, requires C-terminal processing. The activating proteases of pro-PaAP and their cleavage site(s) have not yet been defined. Studying pro-PaAP processing in a wild type P . aeruginosa strain and strains lacking either elastase or both elastase and Apr, we detected three processing variants, each ~56 kDa in size (AP56). Activity assays and N- and C-terminal sequence analyses of these variants pointed at LysC as the principal activating protease, cleaving a Lys 512 -Ala 513 peptide bond at the C-terminal end of pro-PaAP. Elastase and/or Apr are required for activation of LysC, suggesting both are indirectly involved in activation of PaAP. To shed light on the function(s) of the N-terminal domain of AP56, we purified recombinant AP56 and generated from it the 28 kDa catalytic domain (AP28). The kinetic constants ( K m and K cat ) for hydrolysis of Leu-, Lys-, Arg- and Met-p-nitroanilide (pNA) derivatives by AP56 and AP28 were then determined. The catalytic coefficients (K cat / K m ) for hydrolysis of all four substrates by AP28 and AP56 were comparable, indicating that the non-catalytic domain is not involved in hydrolysis of small substrates. It may, however, regulate hydrolysis of natural peptides/proteins. Lys-pNA was hydrolyzed 2 to 3-fold more rapidly than Leu-pNA and ~8-fold faster than Arg- or Met-pNA, indicating that Lys-pNA was the preferred substrate."
https://openalex.org/W3170585846,"Successful embryo implantation requires well-functioning endometrial luminal epithelial cells to establish uterine receptivity. Inadequate uterine receptivity is responsible for approximately two thirds of implantation failures in humans. However, the regulatory mechanism governing this functional process remains largely unexplored. A previous study revealed that the expression of Rictor, the main member of mTORC2, in mouse epithelial cells is increased on the fourth day of gestation (D4). Here, we provide the first report of the involvement of Rictor in the regulation of endometrial receptivity. Rictor was conditionally ablated in the mouse endometrium using a progesterone receptor cre (PRcre ) mouse model. Loss of Rictor altered polarity remodeling and the Na+ channel protein of endometrial cells by mediating Rac-1/PAK1(pPAK1)/ERM(pERM) and Sgk1/pSgk1 signaling, respectively, ultimately resulting in impaired fertility. In the endometrium of women with infertility, the expression of Rictor was changed, along with the morphological transformation and Na+ channel protein of epithelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that Rictor is crucial for the establishment of uterine receptivity in both mice and humans. The present study may help improve the molecular regulatory network of endometrial receptivity and provide new diagnostic and treatment strategies for infertility."
https://openalex.org/W3171347650,"Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is important for agricultural production and the hydrological cycle. Knowledge of ET0 can aid the appropriate allocation of irrigation water in arid regions. This study analyzed the trends in ET0 over different timescales in the Tarim River basin (TRB), Central Asia. ET0 was calculated by the Penman-Monteith method using data from 1960-2017 from 30 meteorological stations located in the TRB. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test with trend-free prewhitening and Sen's slope estimator were applied to detect trends in ET0 variation. The results showed that the mean ET0 decreased at a rate of 0.49 mm·10 a-1 on an annual timescale. The mean ET0 exhibited a decreasing trend in summer and increasing trends in other seasons. The effects of climatic factors on ET0 were assessed by sensitivity analysis and contribution rate analysis. Maximum temperature (Tmax), relative humidity (RH) and wind speed (WS) showed important effects on ET0. However, WS, which decreased, was the key element that induced changes in ET0 in the TRB. This work provides an important baseline for the management of agricultural water resources and scientific planning in agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W3167430100,"Background The National Health Service (NHS) abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening programme (NAAASP) in England screens 65-year-old men. The programme monitors those with an aneurysm, and early intervention for large aneurysms reduces ruptures and AAA-related mortality. AAA screening services have been disrupted following COVID-19 but it is not known how this may impact AAA-related mortality, or where efforts should be focussed as services resume. Methods We repurposed a previously validated discrete event simulation model to investigate the impact of COVID-19-related service disruption on key outcomes. This model was used to explore the impact of delayed invitation and reduced attendance in men invited to screening. Additionally, we investigated the impact of temporarily suspending scans, increasing the threshold for elective surgery to 7cm and increasing drop-out in the AAA cohort under surveillance, using data from NAAASP to inform the population. Findings Delaying invitation to primary screening up to two years had little impact on key outcomes whereas a 10% reduction in attendance could lead to a 2% lifetime increase in AAA-related deaths. In surveillance patients, a 1-year suspension of surveillance or increase in the elective threshold resulted in a 0.4% increase in excess AAA-related deaths (8% in those 5–5.4cm at the start). Longer suspensions or a doubling of drop-out from surveillance would have a pronounced impact on outcomes. Interpretation Efforts should be directed towards encouraging men to attend AAA screening service appointments post-COVID-19. Those with AAAs on surveillance should be prioritised as the screening programme resumes, as changes to these services beyond one year are likely to have a larger impact on surgical burden and AAA-related mortality."

We analyzed univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identified independent predicted factor for developing the nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The correlation of ESR with lymphocytes, monocytes, and ML ratio was performed and visualized in osteoarticular TB patients.Compared with the healthy control group in the dataset GSE83456, the xCell score of basophils, monocytes, neutrophils, and platelets was higher, while lymphoid was lower in the EPTB group. The clinical data showed that the cell count of monocytes were much higher, while the cell counts of lymphocytes were lower in the osteoarticular TB group. AUCs of the nomogram was 0.798 for the dataset GSE83456, and 0.737 for the clinical data. We identified the ML ratio, BMI, and ESR as the independent predictive factors for osteoarticular TB diagnosis and constructed a nomogram for the clinical diagnosis of osteoarticular TB. AUCs of this nomogram was 0.843.We demonstrated a significant change between the ML ratio of the EPTB and non-TB patients.

Clofarabine acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis. We demonstrated that clofarabine may have a novel function though inhibiting CD99, a transmembrane protein highly expressed on Ewing Sarcoma (ES) cells. CD99 is a validated target in ES whose inhibition may lead to a high therapeutic index for patients. Here we present additional data to support the hypothesis that clofarabine acts on CD99 and regulates key signaling pathways in ES. Cellular thermal shift assay indicated a direct interaction between clofarabine and CD99 in ES cell lysates. Clofarabine induced ES cell death does not require clofarabine's conversion to its active form by deoxycytidine kinase. A phosphokinase array screen with clofarabine and a CD99 blocking antibody identified alterations in signaling pathways. CD99 inhibition with clofarabine in ES cells caused rapid and sustained phosphorylation of ERK, MSK, and CREB. However, activation of this pathway did not correlate with clofarabine induced ES cell death. In summary, we demonstrated that clofarabine may activate ERK, MSK, and CREB phosphorylation through CD99 within minutes, however this paradoxical activation and subsequent ES cell death requires additional investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3171207614,"Objectives To investigate whether virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) and iodine maps derived from spectral detector computed tomography (SDCT) improve early assessment of technique efficacy in patients who underwent microwave ablation (MWA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in liver cirrhosis. Methods This retrospective study comprised 39 patients with 49 HCC lesions treated with MWA. Biphasic SDCT was performed 7.7±4.0 days after ablation. Conventional images (CI), VMI and IM were reconstructed. Signal- and contrast-to-noise ratio (SNR, CNR) in the ablation zone (AZ), hyperemic rim (HR) and liver parenchyma were calculated using regions-of-interest analysis and compared between CI and VMI between 40–100 keV. Iodine concentration and perfusion ratio of HR and residual tumor (RT) were measured. Two readers evaluated subjective contrast of AZ and HR, technique efficacy (complete vs. incomplete ablation) and diagnostic confidence at determining technique efficacy. Results Attenuation of liver parenchyma, HR and RT, SNR of liver parenchyma and HR, CNR of AZ and HR were significantly higher in low-keV VMI compared to CI (all p&lt;0.05). Iodine concentration and perfusion ratio differed significantly between HR and RT (all p&lt;0.05; e.g. iodine concentration, 1.6±0.5 vs. 2.7±1.3 mg/ml). VMI 50keV improved subjective AZ-to-liver contrast, HR-to-liver contrast, visualization of AZ margin and vessels adjacent to AZ compared to CI (all p&lt;0.05). Diagnostic accuracy for detection of incomplete ablation was slightly higher in VMI 50keV compared to CI (0.92 vs. 0.89), while diagnostic confidence was significantly higher in VMI 50keV (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Spectral detector computed tomography derived low-keV virtual monoenergetic images and iodine maps provide superior early assessment of technique efficacy of MWA in HCC compared to CI."
https://openalex.org/W3171322003,"The brains of smaller animals are smaller than those of their larger relatives, but it is not clear whether their adaptive behavioral flexibility is more limited. Previous interspecific comparisons found that aspects of web construction behavior of very small orb weaving spiders (0.005 mg) were no less precise than those of much larger related orb weavers (30 mg), but the behaviors tested were relatively simple. Here we perform a more sensitive intraspecific test involving the multiple behavioral adjustments of orb web designs made by Leucauge argyra to confinement in very small spaces. Web adjustments of spiderlings as small as ~0.1 mg were compared to previously published observations of ~80 mg conspecific adults. Spiderlings in constrained spaces made all of the complex adjustments made by adults in at least seven independent web design variables, and their adjustments were no less precise. Rough estimates based on previously published data on total brain volumes and the mean diameters of neuron cell bodies suggested that spiderlings and adult females of Leucauge may have similar numbers of neurons, due to spiderlings having smaller neurons and a greater percentage of body tissues dedicated to the brain. We speculate that this neural similarity may explain why L. argyra spiderlings showed no behavioral deficits compared with adults."
https://openalex.org/W3172376027,"Background Two probability surveys, conducted in the same districts of Bihar, India (Aurangabad and Gopalganj) at approximately the same time in 2016 using identical questionnaires and similar survey methods, produced significantly different responses for 37.2% (58/156) of the indicator comparisons. Interviewers for one survey were men while for the other they were women. Respondents were mothers of children aged 0–59 months living in a traditional rural setting. We examined the influence of interviewer gender on mothers’ survey responses and their implications for interpreting survey results. Methods We used qualitative methods including 10 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 33 in-depth interviews (IDIs) in the same locations as the 2016 surveys. FGD participants were purposefully selected mothers with children 0–59 months, husbands and other in-law family members. IDIs were carried out with frontline health-workers, enumerators and supervisors from the two previous household surveys. Results Findings revealed a preference for female interviewers for household surveys in study districts as they facilitated access to mothers and reduced their discomfort as survey participants. However, this gender preference was related to the survey question. Regardless of age, caste and educational level, most mothers were not permitted to communicate with men (aside from husbands) about female-specific health topics, including birth preparedness, delivery, menstrual cycles, contraception, breastfeeding, sexual behaviour, sexually transmitted disease, and domestic violence. Mothers in higher castes perceived these social restrictions more acutely than mothers in lower castes. There was no systematic direction of the resulting error. Mothers were willing to discuss child health issues with interviewers of either gender. Conclusions Interviewer gender is an important consideration when designing survey protocols for maternal and reproductive health studies and when selecting and training enumerators. Female interviewers are optimal for traditional settings in Bihar as they are more likely to obtain accurate data on sensitive topics and reduce the potential for non-sampling error due to their reduced social distance with maternal respondents."
https://openalex.org/W3169854180,"Crowdsourcing systems are evolving into a powerful tool of choice to deal with repetitive or lengthy human-based tasks. Prominent among those is Amazon Mechanical Turk, in which Human Intelligence Tasks, are posted by requesters, and afterwards selected and executed by subscribed (human) workers in the platform. Many times these HITs serve for research purposes. In this context, a very important question is how reliable the results obtained through these platforms are, in view of the limited control a requester has on the workers’ actions. Various control techniques are currently proposed but they are not free from shortcomings, and their use must be accompanied by a deeper understanding of the workers’ behavior. In this work, we attempt to interpret the workers’ behavior and reliability level in the absence of control techniques. To do so, we perform a series of experiments with 600 distinct MTurk workers, specifically designed to elicit the worker’s level of dedication to a task, according to the task’s nature and difficulty. We show that the time required by a worker to carry out a task correlates with its difficulty, and also with the quality of the outcome. We find that there are different types of workers. While some of them are willing to invest a significant amount of time to arrive at the correct answer, at the same time we observe a significant fraction of workers that reply with a wrong answer. For the latter, the difficulty of the task and the very short time they took to reply suggest that they, intentionally, did not even attempt to solve the task."

Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the accuracy provided by different auxiliary devices during retreatment of direct composite veneers. Seventy-five bovine teeth were prepared for direct composite veneers, scanned (T1), and restored. Specimens were divided into 5 groups for retreatment: conventional high-speed handpiece without auxiliary device (WD); high-speed handpiece with a white LED (WL); high-speed handpiece with an UV light (UL); electric motor and multiplier 1/5 handpiece (EM); and conventional high-speed handpiece using magnifying loupe (ML). After retreatments, other scanning was performed (T2). Changes on dental wear or composite residues areas, as well as, the average between wear and presence of residues were measured. Data were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post-test (p≤ 0.05). There were greater areas of wear for ML, being statistically superior to WD and EM groups. The ML presented smaller residues areas, being statistically lower than the WD and EM groups. Regarding the average between wear and the presence of resin residues, additional wear occurred after re-preparation, regardless of the group. Magnifying loupe promoted greater areas of wear and smaller areas of resin residues than conventional high-speed handpiece and electric motor. Both techniques using light accessories did not differ from other ones."
https://openalex.org/W3171897770,"Sex trafficking, a form of human trafficking for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation, with a global prevalence of 4.5 million, has pervasive effects in the mental and physical health of survivors. However, little is known about the experiences and needs of Latinx migrants (the majority of sex trafficking victims in the US) after trafficking, particularly regarding parenting. This QUAL-quant study examines how 14 survivors of sex trafficking (mean age = 30) from Mexico and Central America encounter and respond to parenting experiences after escaping sexual exploitation. Combining a bio-ecological model of parenting with Zimmerman's framework on human trafficking we identified how trauma related to sex trafficking can challenge parenting and how relational and contextual pre and post trafficking factors (dis)enable women to respond to such challenges. Psychological consequences of daily victimization primarily manifested in three ways: overprotective parenting in a world perceived to be unsafe, emotional withdraw when struggling with stress and mental health symptoms, and challenges building confidence as mothers. These experiences were accentuated by pre-trafficking experiences of neglect and abuse, forced separation from their older children, poverty post-trafficking, and migration-related stressors. Yet, finding meaning in the birth of their child, having social support, and faith, also enable mothers to cope with such challenges. We conclude that motherhood after surviving sex trafficking presents new challenges and opportunities in the path to recovery from trauma. Interventions at the policy, community and individual level are needed to support survivors of sex trafficking as they enter motherhood."
https://openalex.org/W3172335584,"Deterrence, a defender’s avoidance of a challenger’s attack based on the threat of retaliation, is a basic ingredient of social cooperation in several animal species and is ubiquitous in human societies. Deterrence theory has recognized that deterrence can only be based on credible threats, but retaliating being costly for the defender rules this out in one-shot interactions. If interactions are repeated and observable, reputation building has been suggested as a way to sustain credibility and enable the evolution of deterrence. But this explanation ignores both the source and the costs of obtaining information on reputation. Even for small information costs successful deterrence is never evolutionarily stable. Here we use game-theoretic modelling and agent-based simulations to resolve this puzzle and to clarify under which conditions deterrence can nevertheless evolve and when it is bound to fail. Paradoxically, rich information on defenders’ past actions leads to a breakdown of deterrence, while with only minimal information deterrence can be highly successful. We argue that reputation-based deterrence sheds light on phenomena such as costly punishment and fairness, and might serve as a possible explanation for the evolution of informal property rights."

We linked the Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care (RAI-HC) (standardized home care assessment tool) and the Discharge Abstract Databases (for hospital deaths). Patients were grouped into four non-cancer disease groups: cardiovascular, neurological, respiratory, and renal (not mutually exclusive). Our outcomes were the average prevalence of these outcomes, each week, across the last 6 months of life: uncontrolled moderate-severe pain as per the Pain Scale, presence of shortness of breath, mild-severe cognitive impairment as per the Cognitive Performance Scale, and presence of caregiver distress. We conducted a multivariate logistic regression to identify factors associated with having each outcome respectively, in the last 6 months.A total of 20,773 non-cancer patient were included in our study, which were analyzed by disease groups: cardiovascular (n = 12,923); neurological (n = 6,935); respiratory (n = 6,357); and renal (n = 3,062). Roughly 80% of patients were > 75 years and half were female. In the last 6 months of life, moderate to severe pain was frequent in the cardiovascular (57.2%), neurological (42.7%), renal (61.0%) and respiratory (58.3%) patients. Patients with renal disease had significantly higher odds for reporting uncontrolled moderate to severe pain (odds ratio [OR] = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.34) than those who did not. Patients with respiratory disease reported significantly higher odds for shortness of breath (5.37; 95% CI, 5.00 to 5.80) versus those who did not. Patients with neurological disease compared to those without were 9.65 times more likely to experience impaired cognitive performance and had 56% higher odds of caregiver distress (OR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.43 to 1.71).In our cohort of non-cancer patients dying in the community, pain, shortness of breath, impaired cognitive function and caregiver distress are important symptoms to manage near the end of life even in non-institutional settings."

An exploratory phase, made up of 200 subjects (19.1%), and another confirmatory phase, made up of 848 (80.9%), where the questionnaire was also applied. The results supported the three-factor structure of the instrument called ""Questionnaire for the Assessment of Guidance and Tutoring in Higher Education"" (Q-AGT), with of a total of 21 items. The indices of goodness of fit, reliability and internal consistency of the model were considered satisfactory. The application of the questionnaire did not show statistically significant differences in the assessment of university guidance and tutoring between men and women, with a high value given by both sexes to the importance of tutoring, the demands and the competences of the teaching staff in the university. The differences were mainly found between universities and branches of knowledge. Among the main conclusions, what stands out is the achievement of a valid and reliable instrument to measure the development of guidance and tutoring in Latin American universities. This contributes to the assessment of university guidance and tutoring as a strategy for the integral development of the student- personally, academically and professionally- and as a possible protective factor against academic dropout."

The conference was organized by the Transplant Ethics and Policy research program at the New York University (NYU) Grossman School of Medicine Division of Medical Ethics (New York, NY, USA), aiming to examine the unique ethical, legal, and social issues at the intersection of translational genomics and organ transplantation. Advances in genetic and genomic studies have identified an increasing number of novel biomarkers of potential use in transplant-related care. These include predictors of disease course, graft survival, response to immunosuppression, and likelihood of post-transplant disease recurrence or other complications. Future clinical applications raise concerns about the significance of genetic variants, fair access to precision medicine therapeutics and participation in research, ethical approaches to data aggregation and analysis, and the interplay with social determinants of health. This conference endeavored to highlight and discuss key ethical questions raised by this scientific progress. Presenters and panelists provided multidisciplinary expertise spanning medical and surgical transplant care, basic and translational research, bioethics, policymaking, and law. Dr. Minnie Sarwal (University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USA) delivered the keynote address, introducing the role of genomics in transplantation. Dr. Sarwal reviewed the relevant “-omics,” current sequencing and analysis technologies, and basic and translational research methods for identification and validation of biomarkers. As she put it, tissue biopsy, the current clinical gold standard for post-transplantation monitoring, is in fact merely a “copper standard.” Biopsies do not adequately recognize the burden of immune injury at early or reversible stages, are invasive and may not provide a representative sample, and rely on considerable interoperator variability in interpretation. She underscored the enormous potential of genomics in evaluating baseline risk prior to transplantation, tracking preclinical rejection processes, assessing risk of post-transplant complications other than graft rejection, and helping to identify pharmacologic targets for development of new medications and the repositioning of drugs with FDA-approval for other indications. Dr. Tamar Schiff (NYU Grossman School of Medicine) then provided a brief overview of the ethical considerations to be explored throughout the conference. The following two sessions were designed to evaluate ethical issues in the current and future applications of genomics in transplantation, including questions of utility, equity, privacy, consent, and adherence to best practices. The first session highlighted ethical questions raised by current applications of genomics in transplantation through case studies. Dr. Jordan Nestor (Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA) explored the use of genomics in disease course prediction and risk stratification with a discussion of APOL1 testing. APOL1 risk alleles increase the risk of kidney disease, but it is hypothesized that a second-hit mutation is required for disease manifestation, impacting the medical actionability of these risk alleles in living donors prior to donor nephrectomy. Her presentation pointed to a genomics knowledge gap among clinicians as a notable barrier to appropriate implementation of APOL1 screening. Dr. Nicole Ali (NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, USA) next examined ethical concerns surrounding transplantation pharmacogenomics. Describing known genetic variants resulting in faster metabolism of the immunosuppressive medication tacrolimus, she discussed the increased cost burden to patients and payors, and the consequent potential for discrimination. Finally, Dr. Brendan Keating (University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA) introduced the International Genetics and Translational Research in Transplantation Network (iGeneTRAiN), aggregating datasets from major transplant-related genetic studies. His discussion highlighted questions raised by databanking in transplant genomics. In the question-and-answer portion that followed, these three presenters discussed approaches to fostering trust among donors and recipients for participation in genetic testing. This underscored the need for adequate explanation of how returned results may impact families or communities, requiring appropriate support from genetic counselors. They also discussed the importance of promoting diverse demographic representation in databanks from which clinical biomarkers will be identified. Building on these discussions, the next session turned to the broader ethical considerations in the future of transplantation genomics. The first panel, exploring disparities specific to transplant genomics, included Dr. Ajay Israni (Hennepin Healthcare, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA), Dr. Alanna Morris (Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA), and Dr. Ana Iltis (Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC, USA). The panel moderator, Brendan Parent (NYU Grossman School of Medicine), began by relaying that Black and Hispanic patients have less access to transplantation and experience worse outcomes compared to the white population. Wider use of genomics in transplant care has the potential to improve or widen these health inequities. Panelists emphasized the need to reevaluate how ancestry and ethnicity are identified and employed in tissue matching, the importance of developing more diverse cell lines for transplant-related research, and the crucial role of wide stakeholder engagement to address questions of health disparities in this realm. The second panel, exploring responsible clinical implementation of transplantation genomics, was moderated by Dr. Howard Trachtman (NYU Grossman School of Medicine), and included Dr. Sumit Mohan (Columbia University Medical Center), Dr. Ramesh Batra (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA), and Dr. Danton Char (Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA, USA). The panelists raised considerations for clinicians, including with whom genetic results should be shared and how these results should be used in deliberations of medical futility in the critically ill pediatric population. They further discussed issues around consent and reconsent for evolving research, and the way this stands to influence public confidence in personalized medicine. The final panel considered how use of genomics will impact policy and regulation, both in research and organ allocation. The panel included Dr. James DuBois (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA), Dr. Elisa Gordon (Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA), and Dr. David Mulligan (Yale University School of Medicine), and was moderated by Dr. Bruce Gelb (NYU Grossman School of Medicine). Panelists discussed the perils of nonstandardized practice across transplant centers and conflicting interests among stakeholders, including donors and recipients, clinical institutions, and payors. They raised considerations pertaining to genetic exceptionalism and how genetic information should be treated compared to other protected health information as genetic results may be integrated into electronic medical records. The afternoon concluded with a final question-and-answer session with conference speakers, moderated by Dr. Arthur Caplan (NYU Grossman School of Medicine). The session considered future directions in transplant medicine including issues raised by more novel organ transplants, such as uterus transplantation, and the development of xenografts. The presentations and discussions throughout the conference highlighted dynamic ethical considerations to promote proactive development of protocols and policies for responsible and equitable clinical practice in transplantation genomics."

(2017) observed that during CVC insertion through Subclavian Vein (SCV) or the Internal Jugular Vein (IJV) the guidewire is sometimes advanced to the Inferior Vena Cava (IVC), and at other times to the right atrium. The rate of IVC wire cannulation and the association with side and point of insertion is unknown.In this study, we describe guidewire migration location during real time CVC cannulation (right atrium versus IVC) and report the association between the insertion site and side of the CVC and the location of guidewire migration, Right Atrium (RA)/Right Ventricle (RV) versus IVC guidewire migration.This is a retrospective study in the medical intensive care unit among patients that have received CVC during the study years 2014-2020. The rate of IVC versus right atrium/right ventricle wire migration during the procedure were analyzed. The association between the side and point of CVC insertion and the wire migration site was analyzed as well.One hundred and sixty-six patients were enrolled. 33.7% of wires migrated to the IVC and 66.3% to the versus right atrium/right ventricle. The rate of wire migration to the IVC was similar in the IJV site and the SCV site. There was no association between the side of CVC insertion and wire migration to the IVC.About a third of all wire migrations, during CVC Seldinger technique insertion, were identified in the IVC, with no potential for wire associated arrhythmia. There was no association between CVC insertion point (SCV versus IJV) nor the side of insertion and the site of guidewire migration."
https://openalex.org/W3171086068,"Root-knot nematodes cause damage to several crops and the importance of each species can vary according with the crop and the agricultural region. In Brazil, Meloidogyne javanica is one of the most important nematode species parasitizing mulberry. To define management strategies, it is important to know if the crop species is damaged by the parasitism of the nematode and the best choices for control, as the use of nematicides. Biological nematicides have been extensively used in Brazil, but no information regarding its efficiency to control M. javanica in mulberry is available. Besides, it is not known if biological nematicides could improve the quality of leaves or if they alter the nutrient composition of leaves, which could interfere in the development of the silkworms that are feed with these leaves or in the quality of the silk produced. With the aim to address these questions, we propose a study that will start in the phenotyping of the main Brazilian mulberry cultivars to Meloidogyne species, passing through the test of efficiency of biological nematicides in the control of M. javanica in mulberry cultivar Miura, evaluation of the amount and quality of leaves produced and, using these leaves to feed silkworms, in the analyzes of the impact of these diet in the health of silkworms, and in the production and quality of the silk."
