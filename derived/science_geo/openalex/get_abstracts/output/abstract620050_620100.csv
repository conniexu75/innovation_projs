Yet such information often belongs to pharmaceutical companies and is rarely accessible to the scientific community at large. Cristescu et al. provide exploratory analysis of a cancer genomics dataset, collected from four separate clinical trials of Merck's PD-1 immunotherapy drug, pembrolizumab. This informative public resource examines more than 300 patient samples representing 22 different tumor types. Two widely used signatures that currently predict immunotherapy response are tumor mutational burden and a “hot” T cell–inflamed microenvironment. The study analyzed these two proposed biomarkers in combination to see what predictive clinical utility they may hold. Science , this issue p. eaar3593"
https://openalex.org/W2897392759,"Currently, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high performances greater than 20% contain bromine (Br), causing a suboptimal bandgap, and the thermally unstable methylammonium (MA) molecule. Avoiding Br and especially MA can therefore result in more optimal bandgaps and stable perovskites. We show that inorganic cation tuning, using rubidium and cesium, enables highly crystalline formamidinium-based perovskites without Br or MA. On a conventional, planar device architecture, using polymeric interlayers at the electron- and hole-transporting interface, we demonstrate an efficiency of 20.35% (stabilized), one of the highest for MA-free perovskites, with a drastically improved stability reached without the stabilizing influence of mesoporous interlayers. The perovskite is not heated beyond 100°C. Going MA-free is a new direction for perovskites that are inherently stable and compatible with tandems or flexible substrates, which are the main routes commercializing PSCs."

Here, we demonstrate that an innate immune signaling pathway protects synapses from inappropriate removal. The expression patterns of CD47 and its receptor, SIRPα, correlated with peak pruning in the developing retinogeniculate system, and mice lacking these proteins exhibited increased microglial engulfment of retinogeniculate inputs and reduced synapse numbers in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. CD47-deficient mice also displayed increased functional pruning, as measured by electrophysiology. In addition, CD47 was found to be required for neuronal activity-mediated changes in engulfment, as microglia in CD47 knockout mice failed to display preferential engulfment of less active inputs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CD47-SIRPα signaling prevents excess microglial phagocytosis and show that molecular brakes can be regulated by activity to protect specific inputs."

Although self-repair has been demonstrated for some polymers, it usually required specialized monomers. Urban et al. demonstrate that for a very narrow range of compositions, simple vinyl polymers based on methyl methacrylate and n -butyl acrylate show repeatable self-healing properties (see the Perspective by Sumerlin). A key characteristic of this system is that it relies on van der Waals interactions rather than the reformation of hydrogen or covalent bonds for repair.

https://openalex.org/W2897820323,"The 26 S proteasome is the primary eukaryotic degradation machine and thus is critically involved in numerous cellular processes. The heterohexameric adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) motor of the proteasome unfolds and translocates targeted protein substrates into the open gate of a proteolytic core while a proteasomal deubiquitinase concomitantly removes substrate-attached ubiquitin chains. However, the mechanisms by which ATP hydrolysis drives the conformational changes responsible for these processes have remained elusive. Here we present the cryo–electron microscopy structures of four distinct conformational states of the actively ATP-hydrolyzing, substrate-engaged 26 S proteasome. These structures reveal how mechanical substrate translocation accelerates deubiquitination and how ATP-binding, -hydrolysis, and phosphate-release events are coordinated within the AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) motor to induce conformational changes and propel the substrate through the central pore."

https://openalex.org/W2896953036,"Cleaving with a metal handle Using adhesive tape to pull off monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials is now a well-established approach. However, the flakes tend to be micrometer scale, and the creation of multilayer stacks for device application can be challenging and time consuming. Shim et al. show that monolayers of a variety of 2D materials, including molybdenum disulfide and hexagonal boron nitride, can be cleaved from multilayers grown as 5-centimeter-diameter wafers. The multilayer is capped with a nickel layer, which can be used to pull off the entire grown stack. The bottom of the stack is again capped with nickel, and a second round of cleaving leaves the monolayer on the bottom nickel layer. The monolayers could be transferred to other surfaces, which allowed the authors to make field-effect transistors with high charge-carrier mobilities. Science , this issue p. 665"

Meier et al. demonstrated a counterintuitive transition in the opposite direction: Controlled fluctuations in the system's parameters caused it to become topologically nontrivial. The starting point was a one-dimensional lattice of ultracold rubidium atoms in momentum space whose band structure was topologically trivial. The researchers then introduced fluctuations in the tunneling between the lattice sites and monitored the atomic “wires” as the amplitude of the fluctuations increased. The wires first became topologically nontrivial and then went back to trivial for sufficient disorder strengths. Science , this issue p. 929"
https://openalex.org/W2896215637,"Pathologizing Staphylococcus , fast Bacteriophages are the main vehicle for gene swapping in bacteria, notoriously of pathogenicity islands and antibiotic resistance genes. Chen et al. noticed that the Staphylococcus aureus prophages do not excise from their host's genome until very late in their life cycles (see the Perspective by Davidson). Thus, the phage DNA is amplified while embedded in the bacterial chromosome. The resulting concatemers are processively packed into virus capsules while still integrated in the host chromosome. Each virion is only set loose when the capsule has reached physical capacity—a process called “headful” packaging. In situ amplification maximizes viral replication, and the headful mechanism means adjacent bacterial-host DNA also gets grabbed to fill the capsule. This process ensures that host genes are transmitted along with the phage. Science , this issue p. 207 ; see also p. 152"

Eldred et al. studied organoids that recapitulate the development of the human retina and found that differentiation of cone cells into their tuned subtypes was regulated by thyroid hormone. Cones expressing short-wavelength (S) opsin developed first, and cones expressing long- and medium-wavelength (L/M) opsin developed later. The switch toward development of L/M cones depended on thyroid hormone signaling through the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor. Science , this issue p. eaau6348"

The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SWR1 complex bound to a nucleosome at 3.6-angstrom resolution reveals details of the intricate interactions between components of the SWR1 complex and its nucleosome substrate. Interactions between the Swr1 motor domains and the DNA wrap at superhelical location 2 distort the DNA, causing a bulge with concomitant translocation of the DNA by one base pair, coupled to conformational changes of the histone core. Furthermore, partial unwrapping of the DNA from the histone core takes place upon binding of nucleosomes to SWR1 complex. The unwrapping, as monitored by single-molecule data, is stabilized and has its dynamics altered by adenosine triphosphate binding but does not require hydrolysis."

It is also possible to pursue radical coupling strategies by adding just one electron to form a ketyl group. However, the strong reductant supplying that electron often limits the reaction's versatility. Wang et al. report a mild means of forming ketyls by first adding acetyl iodides across the C=O bond (see the Perspective by Blackburn and Roizen). A photoactivated manganese catalyst then temporarily pulls the iodine away, leaving a ketyl to couple with alkynes. The iodine then returns to one of the alkyne's carbons, stabilizing the product but remaining poised for further transformations. Science , this issue p. 225 ; see also p. 157"

https://openalex.org/W2950079377,"Breakthroughs in understanding the neural basis of natural behavior require neural recording and intervention to be paired with high-fidelity multimodal behavioral monitoring. An extensive genetic toolkit for neural circuit dissection, and well-developed neural recording technology, make the mouse a powerful model organism for systems neuroscience. However, most methods for high-bandwidth acquisition of behavioral data in mice rely upon fixed-position cameras and other off-animal devices, complicating the monitoring of animals freely engaged in natural behaviors. Here, we report the development of a lightweight head-mounted camera system combined with head-movement sensors to simultaneously monitor eye position, pupil dilation, whisking, and pinna movements along with head motion in unrestrained, freely behaving mice. The power of the combined technology is demonstrated by observations linking eye position to head orientation; whisking to non-tactile stimulation; and, in electrophysiological experiments, visual cortical activity to volitional head movements."
https://openalex.org/W2897665281,"α-Synuclein (αS) regulates vesicle exocytosis but forms insoluble deposits in Parkinson's disease (PD). Developing disease-modifying therapies requires animal models that reproduce cardinal features of PD. We recently described a previously unrecognized physiological form of αS, α-helical tetramers, and showed that familial PD-causing missense mutations shift tetramers to aggregation-prone monomers. Here, we generated mice expressing the fPD E46K mutation plus 2 homologous E→K mutations in adjacent KTKEGV motifs. This tetramer-abrogating mutant causes phenotypes similar to PD. αS monomers accumulate at membranes and form vesicle-rich inclusions. αS becomes insoluble, proteinase K-resistant, Ser129-phosphorylated, and C-terminally truncated, as in PD. These changes affect regions controlling motor behavior, including a decrease in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The outcome is a progressive motor syndrome including tremor and gait and limb deficits partially responsive to L-DOPA. This fully penetrant phenotype indicates that tetramers are required for normal αS homeostasis and that chronically shifting tetramers to monomers may result in PD, with attendant therapeutic implications."

Real et al. transplanted neural progenitors derived from human iPSCs into the brains of adult mice. They used intravital imaging to visualize how resulting neurons grew and connected. The human cells produced neurons that integrated and developed synaptic networks with oscillatory activity. Dendritic pruning was observed and involved a process of branch retraction, not degeneration. Cells derived from individuals with Down syndrome, upon transplantation into the mouse brain, produced neurons that grew normally but showed reduced dendritic spine turnover and less network activity.

A binary NS merger was recently detected from its gravitational wave emission, but it is unclear how such a tight binary system can be formed. De et al. discovered a core-collapse supernova with unusual properties, including the removal of the outer layers of the star before the explosion. They interpret this as the second supernova in an interacting binary system that already contains one NS. Because the explosion probably produced a second NS (rather than a black hole) in a tight orbit, it could be an example of how binary NS systems form. Science , this issue p. 201"

https://openalex.org/W2897476117,"Reactions that form a product with the same reactive functionality as that of one of the starting compounds frequently end in oligomerization. As a salient example, selective aldol coupling of the smallest, though arguably most useful, enolizable aldehyde, acetaldehyde, with just one partner substrate has proven to be extremely challenging. Here, we report a highly enantioselective Mukaiyama aldol reaction with the simple triethylsilyl (TES) and tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) enolates of acetaldehyde and various aliphatic and aromatic acceptor aldehydes. The reaction is catalyzed by recently developed, strongly acidic imidodiphosphorimidates (IDPi), which, like enzymes, display a confined active site but, like small-molecule catalysts, have a broad substrate scope. The process is scalable, fast, efficient (0.5 to 1.5 mole % catalyst loading), and greatly simplifies access to highly valuable silylated acetaldehyde aldols."

https://openalex.org/W2897458141,"Lysine succinylation is one of the dominant post-translational modification of the protein that contributes to many biological processes including cell cycle, growth and signal transduction pathways. Identification of succinylation sites is an important step for understanding the function of proteins. The complicated sequence patterns of protein succinylation revealed by proteomic studies highlight the necessity of developing effective species-specific in silico strategies for global prediction succinylation sites. Here we have developed the generic and nine species-specific succinylation site classifiers through aggregating multiple complementary features. We optimized the consecutive features using the Wilcoxon-rank feature selection scheme. The final feature vectors were trained by a random forest (RF) classifier. With an integration of RF scores via logistic regression, the resulting predictor termed GPSuc achieved better performance than other existing generic and species-specific succinylation site predictors. To reveal the mechanism of succinylation and assist hypothesis-driven experimental design, our predictor serves as a valuable resource. To provide a promising performance in large-scale datasets, a web application was developed at http://kurata14.bio.kyutech.ac.jp/GPSuc/."

We used out-of-equilibrium occupation of QH edge channels in graphene to excite and detect spin waves in magnetically ordered QH states. Our experiments provide direct evidence for long distance spin wave propagation through different ferromagnetic phases in the N=0 Landau level, as well as across the insulating canted antiferromagnetic phase.

https://openalex.org/W2897974793,"Functional up-regulation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) activity through different posttranslational modifications has been implicated in the survival and proliferation of various cancers. It is increasingly recognized that the HSF1 gene is also up-regulated at the transcriptional level, a phenomenon correlated with poor prognosis for patients with different cancers, including breast cancer. Here, we analyzed the transcriptional up-regulation of HSF1 in human cells upon arsenite- or peroxide-induced oxidative stress. Sequential promoter truncation coupled with bioinformatics analysis revealed that this activation is mediated by two antioxidant response elements (AREs) located between 1707 and 1530 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the HSF1 gene. Using shRNA-mediated down-regulation, ChIP of NRF2, site-directed mutagenesis of the AREs, and DNase I footprinting of the HSF1 promoter, we confirmed that nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2, also known as NFE2L2) interacts with these AREs and up-regulates HSF1 expression. We also found that BRM/SWI2-related gene 1 (BRG1), a catalytic subunit of SWI2/SNF2-like chromatin remodeler, is involved in this process. We further show that NRF2-dependent HSF1 gene regulation plays a crucial role in cancer cell biology, as interference with NRF2-mediated HSF1 activation compromised survival, migration potential, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and autophagy in MCF7 breast cancer cells exposed to oxidative stress. Taken together, our findings unravel the mechanistic basis of HSF1 gene regulation in cancer cells and provide molecular evidence supporting a direct interaction between HSF1 and NRF2, critical regulators of two cytoprotective mechanisms exploited by cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2896423589,"Neuronal diversification is a fundamental step in the construction of functional neural circuits, but how neurons generated from single progenitor domains acquire diverse subtype identities remains poorly understood. Here we developed an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based system to model subtype diversification of V1 interneurons, a class of spinal neurons comprising four clades collectively containing dozens of molecularly distinct neuronal subtypes. We demonstrate that V1 subtype diversity can be modified by extrinsic signals. Inhibition of Notch and activation of retinoid signaling results in a switch to MafA clade identity and enriches differentiation of Renshaw cells, a specialized MafA subtype that mediates recurrent inhibition of spinal motor neurons. We show that Renshaw cells are intrinsically programmed to migrate to species-specific laminae upon transplantation and to form subtype-specific synapses with motor neurons. Our results demonstrate that stem cell-derived neuronal subtypes can be used to investigate mechanisms underlying neuronal subtype specification and circuit assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2897685955,"Preterm birth (PTB), the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, urgently requires novel therapeutic agents. Spontaneous PTB, resulting from preterm labor, is commonly caused by intrauterine infection/ inflammation. Statins are well-established, cholesterol-lowering drugs that can reduce inflammation and inhibit vascular smooth muscle contraction. We show that simvastatin reduced the incidence of PTB in a validated intrauterine LPS-induced PTB mouse model, decreased uterine proinflammatory mRNA concentrations (IL-6, Cxcl1, and Ccl2), and reduced serum IL-6 concentration. In human myometrial cells, simvastatin reduced proinflammatory mediator mRNA and protein expression (IL-6 and IL-8) and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression (IL-10 and IL-13). Critically, simvastatin inhibited myometrial cell contraction, basally and during inflammation, and reduced phosphorylated myosin light chain concentration. Supplementation with mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate, abolished these anticontractile effects, indicating that the Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase pathway is critically involved. Thus, simvastatin reduces PTB incidence in mice, inhibits myometrial contractions, and exhibits key anti-inflammatory effects, providing a rationale for investigation into the repurposing of statins to treat preterm labor in women.—Boyle, A.

https://openalex.org/W2895899729,"For most retroviruses, including HIV-1, binding of the Gag polyprotein to the plasma membrane (PM) is mediated by interactions between Gag's N-terminal myristoylated matrix (MA) domain and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the PM. The Gag protein of avian sarcoma virus (ASV) lacks the N-myristoylation signal but contains structural domains having functions similar to those of HIV-1 Gag. The molecular mechanism by which ASV Gag binds to the PM is incompletely understood. Here, we employed NMR techniques to elucidate the molecular determinants of the membrane-binding domain of ASV MA (MA87) to lipids and liposomes. We report that MA87 binds to the polar head of phosphoinositides such as PI(4,5)P2. We found that MA87 binding to inositol phosphates (IPs) is significantly enhanced by increasing the number of phosphate groups, indicating that the MA87–IP binding is governed by charge–charge interactions. Using a sensitive NMR-based liposome-binding assay, we show that binding of MA87 to liposomes is enhanced by incorporation of PI(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylserine. We also show that membrane binding is mediated by a basic surface formed by Lys-6, Lys-13, Lys-23, and Lys-24. Substitution of these residues to glutamate abolished binding of MA87 to both IPs and liposomes. In an accompanying paper, we further report that mutation of these lysine residues diminishes Gag assembly on the PM and inhibits ASV particle release. These findings provide a molecular basis for ASV Gag binding to the inner leaflet of the PM and advance our understanding of the basic mechanisms of retroviral assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2897974860,"Antibiotic resistance is a major public health problem requiring the early optimization of antibiotic prescriptions. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been shown to accurately identify bacteria from positive blood culture. Here, we developed a rapid detection of Escherichia coli resistance to amoxicillin (AMX) and cefotaxime (CTX) from positive blood culture based on MALDI-TOF MS. Potential sparing of broad-spectrum antibiotics was also evaluated. We tested 103 E. coli-positive blood cultures. Blood cultures were subculture 1-hour in antibiotic-free rich liquid media before further incubation with and without AMX for 2.5 h or CTX for 2 h. Protein extracts associated with an internal control were spotted on a MALDI-TOF target and spectra were analyzed with the MBT-ASTRA prototype software (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). Bacterial growth ratio was calculated from the AUC spectra obtained in the presence and absence of the antibiotic and compared to a threshold which classified E. coli as susceptible or resistant. Results were interpreted with MICs determined using agar dilution method as reference technique. MBT-ASTRA recognized 95% and 84% of the AMX- and CTX-susceptible isolates, respectively. Overall, quantitative analysis of mass spectra allows susceptibility testing within 4 hours after the positivity of blood culture with E. coli. At the first report of positive blood culture, MALDI-TOF MS would then provide the prescribers with the bacterial identification and the susceptibility to AMX and CTX, thus limiting the use of broad-spectrum compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2896883548,"Frizzleds (FZDs) are receptors for secreted lipoglycoproteins of the Wingless/Int-1 (WNT) family, initiating an important signal transduction network in multicellular organisms. FZDs are G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are well known to be regulated by phosphorylation, leading to specific downstream signaling or receptor desensitization. The role and underlying mechanisms of FZD phosphorylation remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the phosphorylation of human FZD6. Using MS analysis and a phospho-state– and -site–specific antibody, we found that Ser-648, located in the FZD6 C terminus, is efficiently phosphorylated by casein kinase 1 δ (CK1δ) and that this phosphorylation requires the scaffolding protein Dishevelled (DVL). In an overexpression system, DVL1, -2, and -3 promoted CK1δ-mediated FZD6 phosphorylation on Ser-648. This DVL activity required an intact DEP domain and FZD-mediated recruitment of this domain to the cell membrane. Substitution of the CK1δ-targeted phosphomotif reduced FZD6 surface expression, suggesting that Ser-648 phosphorylation controls membrane trafficking of FZD6. Phospho-Ser-648 FZD6 immunoreactivity in human fallopian tube epithelium was predominantly apical, associated with cilia in a subset of epithelial cells, compared with the total FZD6 protein expression, suggesting that FZD6 phosphorylation contributes to asymmetric localization of receptor function within the cell and to epithelial polarity. Given the key role of FZD6 in planar cell polarity, our results raise the possibility that asymmetric phosphorylation of FZD6 rather than asymmetric protein distribution accounts for polarized receptor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2896085252,"The Gag protein of avian sarcoma virus (ASV) lacks an N-myristoyl (myr) group, but contains structural domains similar to those of HIV-1 Gag. Similarly to HIV-1, ASV Gag accumulates on the plasma membrane (PM) before egress; however, it is unclear whether the phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 binds directly to the matrix (MA) domain of ASV Gag, as is the case for HIV-1 Gag. Moreover, the role of PI(4,5)P2 in ASV Gag localization and budding has been controversial. Here, we report that substitution of residues that define the PI(4,5)P2-binding site in the ASV MA domain (reported in an accompanying paper) interfere with Gag localization to the cell periphery and inhibit the production of virus-like particles (VLPs). We show that co-expression of Sprouty2 (Spry2) or the pleckstrin homology domain of phospholipase Cδ (PH-PLC), two proteins that bind PI(4,5)P2, affects ASV Gag trafficking to the PM and budding. Replacement of the N-terminal 32 residues of HIV-1 MA, which encode its N-terminal myr signal and its PI(4,5)P2-binding site, with the structurally equivalent N-terminal 24 residues of ASV MA created a chimera that localized at the PM and produced VLPs. In contrast, the homologous PI(4,5)P2-binding signal in ASV MA could target HIV-1 Gag to the PM when substituted, but did not support budding. Collectively, these findings reveal a basic patch in both ASV and HIV-1 Gag capable of mediating PM binding and budding for ASV but not for HIV-1 Gag. We conclude that PI(4,5)P2 is a strong determinant of ASV Gag targeting to the PM and budding."

Among the ARSs, glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (ERS; encoded by EARS gene) and prolyl-tRNA synthetase (PRS; encoded by PARS gene) are uniquely present as a single fused bifunctional protein, glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS or GluProRS). EPRS is encoded by a fused gene in all known metazoans, with the unique exception of Caenorhabditis elegans (9Berthonneau E. Mirande M.

Mammalian EPRS resides in the MSC and catalyzes the ligation of both glutamic acid and proline to their respective tRNAs. The two synthetase domains are joined by a flexible linker generally containing one or more helix-turn-helix WHEP domains. The catalytic domains of EPRS are highly conserved; however, the WHEP domains show sequence divergence and duplications (and occasional losses) and are present in a variable number in animals (11Ray P.S. Fox P.L. Origin and evolution of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase WHEP domains reveal evolutionary relationships within Holozoa.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (24968216)e9849310.1371/journal.pone.0098493Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The linker is responsible for two of the noncanonical functions of EPRS. (i) It binds three other proteins (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ribosomal protein L13a, and NSAP1) in interferon-γ–activated myeloid cells to form the interferon-γ–activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex that binds and silences the translation of multiple mRNAs encoding inflammation-related proteins (12Mukhopadhyay R.

ERS and PRS are products of two distinct genes in all bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants, and thus EPRS likely results from an early gene fusion event, i.e. the merger of two previously distinct genes into a single transcription unit (16Long M. Betrán E. Thornton K. Wang W. The origin of new genes: glimpses from the young and old.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4 (14634634): 865-87510.1038/nrg1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The fusion of ERS- and PRS-encoding genes can be traced back to near the origin of animals. Recent sequencing of organisms near the base of metazoans revealed that ERS and PRS are unlinked in the unicellular icthyosporean Sphaeroforma arctica but are linked to form EPRS containing two WHEP domains in the unicellular filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki. Thus, the fusion event occurred in a unicellular opisthokont after the divergence from fungi about 1 billion years ago (11Ray P.S. Fox P.L. Origin and evolution of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase WHEP domains reveal evolutionary relationships within Holozoa.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (24968216)e9849310.1371/journal.pone.0098493Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The advantage underlying the specific selection of the synthetase genes encoding ERS and PRS for fusion, and its maintenance in nearly all animals, is not known. We considered the possibility that a fused EPRS was required for structural integrity of the MSC. Small complexes of two to four ARSs are present in some archaea, trypanosomes, and fungi, all organisms lacking fused EPRS (17Havrylenko S. Mirande M. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complexes in evolution.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015; 16 (25807264): 6571-659410.3390/ijms16036571Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Through a gradual process of accretion and occasional deletion of specific ARSs, a “mega” MSC consisting of eight or more ARSs (plus noncatalytic auxiliary proteins) appeared at about the same time as the linkage of ERS and PRS in metazoan animals or their unicellular animal-like ancestors (Fig. 1). However, the large MSC in C. elegans containing eight ARSs, including ERS but not PRS, suggests that a fused EPRS is not essential for MSC formation or integrity (18Havrylenko S. Legouis R. Negrutskii B. Mirande M. Caenorhabditis elegans evolves a new architecture for the multi-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (21685384): 28476-2848710.1074/jbc.M111.254037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a putative requirement for EPRS in structural integrity of the MSC does not clarify the specific selection of this ARS pair for the fusion. Here, we address an alternate hypothesis and provide support with a mathematical model that a confluence of metabolic, biochemical, and environmental factors contributed to the specific fusion of EARS and PARS genes to form the bifunctional gene, EPRS. We considered the metabolic relationship between glutamic acid and proline, the former is the precursor of the latter, as a potential basis for the fusion event. We have previously reported the deep relationship between glucose catabolism and ARSs and their amino acid substrates (1Eswarappa S.M. Fox P.L. Citric acid cycle and the origin of MARS.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38 (23415030): 222-22810.1016/j.tibs.2013.01.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Nineteen of the 20 amino acids are derived from intermediates of either glycolysis or the citric acid cycle (histidine is the sole exception). Moreover, eight of the nine amino acid substrates of the ARS constituents of the MSC are derived from two intermediates of the citric acid cycle, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and oxaloacetate. Importantly, glutamic acid is derived from α-KG and is the precursor of proline (along with glutamine and arginine) (Fig. 2). In certain organisms, proline can be generated from ornithine; however, ornithine is derived from arginine, which in turn is derived from glutamic acid (19Baich A.

The synthesis of proline from glutamic acid is inhibited by proline-mediated negative feedback of pyroline-5-carboxylate reductase (21Valle D. Downing S.J. Phang J.M.

An important implication of the dependence of proline on glutamic acid is that an increased demand for proline will not only deplete cellular free proline, it can also drain glutamic acid from the cellular pool, which will in turn affect cellular levels of glutamine and arginine. These observations led us to consider the unique metabolic relationship between glutamic acid and proline as the underlying force driving the fusion of their cognate ARSs. In organisms from bacteria to animals, there are multiple examples of depletion of an amino acid inducing up-regulation of the corresponding ARS. The elevated ARS level presumably enables more efficient utilization of the limiting amino acid, thereby providing a survival advantage to the cell when a particular amino acid is in short supply. For example, valine limitation induces the expression of ValRS (23Luo D. Leautey J. Grunberg-Manago M. Putzer H. Structure and regulation of expression of the Bacillus subtilis valyl-tRNA synthetase gene.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179 (9098041): 2472-247810.1128/jb.179.8.2472-2478.1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, the induction is driven by a tRNA-mediated antitermination mechanism during ARS gene transcription (24Putzer H. Laalami S. Brakhage A.A. Condon C. Grunberg-Manago M.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, when lysine is deficient, uncharged tRNALys binds GCN2, thereby increasing the translation of GCN4, a transcriptional activator of LysRS (28Ryckelynck M. Giegé R.

Similar regulation has been reported in higher eukaryotes, but molecular mechanisms remain unclear. For example, expression of PheRS and MetRS is elevated in cultured animal cells grown in media deficient in phenylalanine and methionine, respectively (29Lazard M. Mirande M. Waller J.P. Expression of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Specific depression of the methionyl-tRNA synthetase component upon methionine restriction.J. Biol.

In a related example, expression of EPRS increases in rat salivary glands when the expression of proline- and glutamic acid–rich proteins are induced by isoproterenol, presumably depleting the free amino acid pools (31Ting S.M. Dignam J.D. Post-transcriptional regulation of glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase in rat salivary gland.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (8132637): 8993-8998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these examples, the response is specific, and the ARS gene is induced only by limitation of the cognate amino acid, not by general amino acid starvation. Thus, amino acids are primary regulators of their cognate ARSs in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We propose that the increase in demand for proline, and the consequent reduction in the cellular pools of proline and glutamic acid, would have markedly induced expression of ProRS and GluRS in those early organisms, further reducing the cellular pools of these amino acids. This vicious cycle would cause extremely harmful consequences to the cell and organism, and its avoidance conceivably was the driving force behind the fusion event. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model that captures the relationship between the cellular concentrations of free proline and glutamic acid and the protein levels of their corresponding ARSs in two systems, i.e. organisms with distinct EARS and PARS genes and organisms with a fused EPRS gene. Our dynamic model consists of a system of ordinary differential equations as shown below (for details, see the supporting information). The ERS-PRS system is represented by Equations 1–4. d[E]dt=k1[α-KG]−[k2[E]δ+[P]]−k3[E][ERS]−k4[E](Eq. 1) d[P]dt=[k2[E]δ+[P]]−k5[P][PRS](Eq. 2) d[ERS]dt=kEsynδ+[E]−kEdeg[ERS](Eq. 3) d[PRS]dt=kPsynδ+[P]−kPdeg[PRS](Eq. 4) The EPRS system is represented by Equations 5–7. d[E]dt=k1[α-KG]−[k2[E]δ+[P]]−k3[E][ERS]−k4[E](Eq. 5) d[P]dt=[k2[E]δ+[P]]−k5[P][EPRS](Eq. 6) d[EPRS]dt=kEPsynδ+[E]−kEPdeg[EPRS](Eq. 7) where [E], [P], [ERS], [PRS], [EPRS], and [α-KG] represent cellular concentrations of free glutamic acid (E), free proline (P), ERS, PRS, EPRS, and α-KG, respectively. Parameters designated as ki represent the rate or proportionality constants. All parameters in the model are defined in the supporting information. Units of all constants and variables are listed in Tables S1 and S2. By exploring a range of values for the rate and proportionality constants, we determined a parameter space in which both ERS-PRS and EPRS systems were stable with respect to cellular levels of [E], [P], [ERS], [PRS], and [EPRS]. Values that resulted in [E] or [P] equal to 0 in both systems were eliminated. Initial values of the variables and the rate constants used in the simulations are given in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. The simulations revealed that steady-state levels of E and P are slightly higher in the EPRS system, and [EPRS] is lower than either [ERS] or [PRS] (Fig. 3). Intriguingly, proteome proline content, and presumably total proline incorporated into protein, undergoes an upward shift at the transition from the icthyosporean S. arctica, which contains nonfused ERS and PRS, to the filasterean C. owczarzaki, the earliest known organism with fused EPRS (Table 1). Similarly, the proteome proline contents of compilations (n = 34 per group) of prokaryotes (mean percentage, 4.30 ± 0.16) and nonanimal eukaryotes (mean percentage, 4.56 ± 0.19) are much less than that in Animalia (mean percentage, 5.67 ± 0.19) (p < 0.0001, Mann–Whitney test) (Tables S3 to S5), consistent with a previous report (32Tekaia F. Yeramian E. Dujon B. Amino acid composition of genomes, lifestyles of organisms, and evolutionary trends: a global picture with correspondence analysis.Gene. 2002; 297 (12384285): 51-6010.1016/S0378-1119(02)00871-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). EARS and PARS genes are unfused in C. elegans (9Berthonneau E. Mirande M. A gene fusion event in the evolution of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.FEBS Lett. 2000; 470 (10745085): 300-30410.1016/S0014-5793(00)01343-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and a similar split was found in seven other nematodes (Table S6). Interestingly, the proteome proline content in nematodes (mean percentage, 4.83 ± 0.20) is much less than in other animals (p < 0.005, Mann–Whitney test). These observations support the link between proline demand and the appearance of fused EPRS. The increase in proline content in animal proteomes might be a result of the advent of proline-rich proteins, such as collagen, which have played a vital role in the emergence of colonies and multicellular animals by serving as a support for cell–cell interactions (33Heino J. Huhtala M. Käpylä J. Johnson M.S. Evolution of collagen-based adhesion systems.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2009; 41 (18790075): 341-34810.1016/j.biocel.2008.08.021Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Actual proline utilization in metazoans is likely to be even higher than that reflected by proteome proline content because proline-rich collagen is the most abundant protein in animals. Importantly, collagen first appeared at about the time of the emergence of animals and the appearance of EPRS (Fig. 1) (34Exposito J.Y. Cluzel C. Garrone R. Lethias C. Evolution of collagens.Anat.

A 10% increase in k5 (from 0.10 to 0.11) caused only a small perturbation in steady-state levels of amino acids and ARSs in both systems (Figure 3, Figure 4, A and B). In contrast, a 30% increase in k5 (to 0.13) markedly decreased glutamic acid and proline and increased [ERS] and [PRS], but only in the ERS-PRS system (Fig. 4, C and D). A 50% increase in k5 (to 0.15) in the ERS-PRS system caused a catastrophic effect in which glutamic acid and proline concentrations declined rapidly to near-zero, with a concomitant dramatic induction of ERS and PRS (Fig. 4E). Importantly, the EPRS system was only modestly perturbed, maintaining glutamic acid and proline at only slightly diminished levels (Fig. 4F). These results suggest that organisms with fused EPRS gene have a clear survival advantage in conditions of increased proline demand. At the time of the origin of animals, the atmospheric O2 level was less than 1% of the current amount (35Mills D.B. Canfield D.E. Oxygen and animal evolution: did a rise of atmospheric oxygen “trigger” the origin of animals?.BioEssays. 2014; 36 (25244426): 1145-115510.1002/bies.201400101Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 36Bergman N.M.

Hypoxia inhibits the citric acid cycle, and thus organisms at the root of metazoan evolution would have reduced citric acid flux and consequent diminished levels of α-KG (37Webster K.A. Evolution of the coordinate regulation of glycolytic enzyme genes by hypoxia.J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206 (12878660): 2911-292210.1242/jeb.00516Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 38Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Sonenshein A.L. Anaerobic regulation of Bacillus subtilis Krebs cycle genes.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180 (9642180): 3304-3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, hypoxia reduces α-KG levels by increasing its carboxylation to citrate by isocitrate dehydrogenase (39Wise D.R. Ward P.S. Shay J.E. Cross J.R. Gruber J.J. Sachdeva U.M. Platt J.M. DeMatteo R.G. Simon M.C. Thompson C.B. Hypoxia promotes isocitrate dehydrogenase-dependent carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate to citrate to support cell growth and viability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Moreover, the glyoxylate shunt that bypasses α-KG was likely prevalent in organisms preceding the gene fusion event, further decreasing α-KG generation and the steady-state level of derived amino acids (Fig. 2) (1Eswarappa S.M. Fox P.L. Citric acid cycle and the origin of MARS.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38 (23415030): 222-22810.1016/j.tibs.2013.01.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 40Kondrashov F.A. Koonin E.V. Morgunov I.G. Finogenova T.V.

A 10% decrease (from 5.0 to 4.5) caused a major perturbation in the key synthetases and substrates in the ERS-PRS system only (Fig. 5, A–D). A 20% reduction in the α-KG level led to catastrophic depletion of glutamic acid and proline in the ERS-PRS system (and concomitant increases in ERS and PRS), but both were maintained at nearly half of the original level in the EPRS system (Fig. 5, E and F). We then simulated the effect of concurrent, modest increases in proline demand and reduced α-KG, conditions possibly more representative of the epoch of the gene fusion event. A 10% decrease in [α-KG] combined with a 30% increase in the rate of proline incorporation into protein (k5) was catastrophic for the ERS-PRS system, but only modest reductions in glutamic acid and proline were observed in the EPRS system (Fig. 6). These analyses are consistent with a marked resilience of the EPRS system to altered environmental and metabolic stresses that was possibly a major advantage driving the fusion of the ERS and PRS during early animal evolution.Figure 6Combined influence of increased proline utilization and decreased α-KG on system outputs. The rate of proline utilization, k5, was set at 0.10, and [α-KG] was set at 5.0 (A and B), or k5 was set at 0.13, and [α-KG] was set at 4.5 (C and D) for the ERS-PRS (A and C) and EPRS (B and D) systems. Other system parameters and outputs were as in Fig. 3. To permit direct comparison, Fig. 3, A and B, are redisplayed here in A and B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We considered alternate systems that could also provide protection against the cellular stress conditions described in Fig. 6C. Increasing the rate of synthesis of glutamic acid from α-KG (Fig. 7A), reducing the rate of incorporation of glutamic acid into protein (Fig. 7B), and reducing the rate of synthesis of ERS (Fig. 7C) all enabled survival of the ERS-PRS system under high proline demand and low-level α-KG. These alternative systems are less efficient as the steady-state proline level is lower than that in the fusion system (Fig. 6D). Also, reducing the rate of incorporation of glutamic acid into protein (Fig. 7B) or the steady-state level of ERS by reducing its rate of synthesis (Fig. 7C) (or increasing its degradation rate; not shown) might be detrimental to cell viability as both would compromise protein synthesis. Because α-KG is required to maintain the optimal level of citric acid flux, enhanced synthesis of glutamic acid from already limited α-KG might not be a viable solution. We recognized that the fusion event, by combining the two genes behind the promoter driving ERS, might prevent the regulation of EPRS transcription by proline. We considered the alternate possibility that the EARS and PARS genes remain unfused, but PRS regulation by [P] is lost. The absence of negative regulation of PRS by [P] (termed ERS-PRSΔP system) can be represented by Equations 1–3 and 8. d[PRS]dtkPsyn−kPdeg[PRS](Eq. 8) Unexpectedly, this solution yielded steady-state levels of ERS and PRS and their cognate amino acids similar to that resulting from EPRS fusion, implicating negative regulation of PRS by [P] as a critically important factor (Fig. 7D). We analyzed the relative benefits of the EPRS and ERS-PRSΔP systems, compared with the ERS-PRS system, with respect to the maintenance of cellular proline and glutamic acid under a range of α-KG concentrations. Compared with ERS-PRS, the fused EPRS system led to higher levels of both amino acids at all concentrations of α-KG examined (Fig. 8, A and B). The ERS-PRSΔP system was more effective than ERS-PRS only at α-KG levels below 6. Moreover, at α-KG levels below 4.5, the ERS-PRSΔP system was more effective than EPRS. Thus, the EPRS system might be more versatile than the others: it not only thrives in high proline demand and low α-KG conditions, but it can also take advantage of conditions of relatively high α-KG. Nevertheless, there might be other factors that drove adoption of fusion instead of the alternative solution involving loss of regulation by proline while maintaining distinct EARS and PARS genes. The environmental conditions on Earth a billion years ago were extremely dynamic and contributed to an equally dynamic evolution of life forms, including the critical switch in size and complexity during the transition from unicellular to multicellular eukaryotes. We previously reported that linked EPRS first appeared in an ancestor of the unicellular holozoan, C. owczarzaki (11Ray P.S. Fox P.L. Origin and evolution of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase WHEP domains reveal evolutionary relationships within Holozoa.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (24968216)e9849310.1371/journal.pone.0098493Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this early ancestor of animals exhibited a life cycle during which they formed clusters of cells. In fact, C. owczarzaki is the earliest known example of aggregative multicellularity in a unicellular relative of a multicellular metazoan (41Sebé-Pedrós A. Irimia M. Del Campo J. Parra-Acero H. Russ C. Nusbaum C. Blencowe B.J. Ruiz-Trillo I. Regulated aggregative multicellularity in a close unicellular relative of metazoa.Elife. 2013; 2 (24368732)e0128710.7554/eLife.01287Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cell clusters might deprive interior cell access to the environment, further depleting oxygen levels in an already oxygen-poor atmosphere. The transition to multicellularity necessitated the development of connective tissues as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM receptors. Consistent with its place in the transition to multicellularity, C. owczarzaki expresses genes encoding ECM-like domains and ECM receptors (42Fidler A.L. Darris C.E. Chetyrkin S.V. Pedchenko V.K. Boudko S.P. Brown K.L. Gray Jerome W. Hudson J.K. Rokas A. Hudson B.G. Collagen IV and basement membrane at the evolutionary dawn of metazoan tissues.Elife. 2017; 6 (28418331)e2417610.7554/eLife.24176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the origin of collagens and collagen-like genes might have coincided with the sudden and dramatic increase in atmospheric oxygen that is required for conversion of proline to hydroxyproline, a major collagen constituent. The environmental challenges present a billion years ago are no longer relevant, which begs the question why do extant metazoans maintain the fused EPRS gene? Although the current environment is far different from that present a billion years ago, tissue metabolic conditions might be determinative. For example, localized extremes in tissue hypoxia might provide an adaptive advantage to the fused protein. Alternatively, the RNA- and protein-binding functions of the WHEP domain–containing EPRS linker, required for the noncanonical activities of transcript-selective translation regulation and fatty acid uptake, contributed to its retention (13Arif A. Jia J. Mukhopadhyay R. Willard B. Kinter M. Fox P.L. Two-site phosphorylation of EPRS coordinates multimodal regulation of noncanonical translational control activity.Mol.

The maintenance of fused EPRS in extant animals can also be explained by the constructive neutral evolution hypothesis. According to this theory, complexity in organisms emerges following accumulation of neutral mutations in groups of proteins (or protein subunits or domains) that do not change the functional property of the proteins, but the interdependence of the mutations prevents their deletion, and thus they are essentially unidirectional (43Lynch M. The frailty of adaptive hypotheses for the origins of organismal complexity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mol. Evol. 1999; 49 (10441669): 169-18110.1007/PL00006540Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The EPRS gene likely accrued neutral mutations during its billion-year evolution. Fixation of these mutations could have made ERS and PRS structures or functions of EPRS mutually dependent, thereby decreasing the fitness of animals following a fission event that disconnected the ERS and PRS genes and proteins. A potentially informative exception is the nematode C. elegans in which a fission event generated ERS protein with six C-terminal WHEP domains and PRS with a single N-terminal WHEP domain (46Ray P.S. Sullivan J.C. Jia J. Francis J. Finnerty J.R. Fox P.L. Evolution of function of a fused metazoan tRNA synthetase.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2011; 28 (20829344): 437-44710.1093/molbev/msq246Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The continued presence of the WHEP domains suggests that a noncanonical function was retained, possibly favoring the metabolic and functional hypotheses, rather than the constructive neutral evolution hypothesis, for retention of the linked EPRS in nearly all present-day animals.

https://openalex.org/W2895850984,"A variety of biogas residues (BGRs) have been used as organic fertilizer in agriculture. The use of these residues affects the storage of soil organic matter (SOM). In most cases, SOM changes can only be determined in long-term observations. Therefore, predictive modeling can be an efficient alternative, provided that the parameters required by the model are known for the considered BGRs. This study was conducted as a first approach to estimating the organic matter (OM) turnover parameters of BGRs for process modeling. We used carbon mineralization data from six BGRs from an incubation experiment, representing a range of substrate inputs, to calculate a turnover coefficient k controlling the velocity of fresh organic matter (FOM) decay and a synthesis coefficient η describing the SOM creation from FOM. An SOM turnover model was applied in inverse mode to identify both parameters. In a second step, we related the parameters k and η to chemical properties of the corresponding BGRs using a linear regression model and applied them to a long-term scenario simulation. According to the results of the incubation experiment, the k values ranged between 0.28 and 0.58 d-1 depending on the chemical composition of the FOM. The estimated η values ranged between 0.8 and 0.89. The best linear relationship of k was found to occur with pH (R2 = 0.863). Parameter η is related to the Ct/Norg ratio (R2 = 0.696). Long-term scenario simulations emphasized the necessity of specific k and η values related to the chemical properties for each BGR. However, further research is needed to validate and improve these preliminary results."

However, few studies have investigated the presence of DM in cognitively impaired patients and its effect on brain iron and calcium accumulation. Therefore, we assessed the effects of DM on cognitively impaired patients using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). From June 2012 to Feb 2014, 92 eligible cognitively impaired patients underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There were 46 patients with DM (DM+) and 46 aged matched patients without DM (DM-). QSM was obtained from gradient echo data and analyzed by drawing regions of interest around relevant anatomical structures. Clinical factors and vascular pathology were also evaluated. Measurement differences between DM+ and DM- patients were assessed by t tests. A multiple regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of magnetic susceptibility. DM+ patients showed lower susceptibility values, indicative of lower brain iron content, than DM- patients, which was significant in the hippocampus (4.80 ± 8.31 ppb versus 0.22 ± 10.60 ppb, p = 0.024) and pulvinar of the thalamus (36.30 ± 19.88 ppb versus 45.90 ± 20.02 ppb, p = 0.023). On multiple regression analysis, microbleed number was a predictor of susceptibility change in the hippocampus (F = 4.291, beta = 0.236, p = 0.042) and DM was a predictor of susceptibility change in the pulvinar of the thalamus (F = 4.900, beta = - 0.251, p = 0.030). In cognitively impaired patients, presence of DM was associated with lower susceptibility change in the pulvinar of the thalamus and hippocampus. This suggests that there may be region-specific alterations of calcium deposition in cognitively impaired subjects with DM."

However, research on affective forecasting shows that self-judgments of emotions are inaccurate in hypothetical situations. Here we show a study in which we first presented a hypothetical schadenfreude situation and few months later, due to an exceptional circumstance, the situation turned out to happen in reality. This fortuitous circumstance allowed us to compare people’s imagined emotional reactions with their actual feelings. Results showed that schadenfreude was higher in the real situation than in the hypothetical one. More importantly, participants used different proxies to predict their emotional reaction: while out-group dislike served as a proxy of schadenfreude in both types of scenario, the degree of in-group identification also increased schadenfreude in those who had experienced the real event, arguably a mechanism to promote positive self-evaluation. These results highlight the importance of assessing schadenfreude in the heat of the moment."

Methods PTFV1 was collected manually from baseline electrocardiograms of clinically stroke-free Northern Manhattan Study participants. Investigators read brain MRIs for superficial infarcts, deep infarcts, and white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV). WMHV was adjusted for head size and log transformed, achieving a normal distribution. Logistic regression models investigated the association of PTFV1 with cortical and with all subclinical infarcts. Linear regression models examined logWMHV. Models were adjusted for demographics and risk factors. Results Among 1174 participants with PTFV1 measurements, the mean age at MRI was 70 ± 9 years. Participants were 14.4% white, 17.6% black, and 65.8% Hispanic. Mean PTFV1 was 3587.35 ± 2315.62 μV-ms. Of the 170 subclinical infarcts, 40 were cortical. PTFV1 ≥ 5000 μV-ms was associated with WMHV in a fully adjusted model (mean difference in logWMHV 0.15, 95% confidence interval 0.01–0.28). PTFV1 exhibited a trend toward an association with cortical infarcts (unadjusted OR per SD change logPTFV1 1.30, 95% CI 0.94–1.81), but not with all subclinical infarcts. Conclusion Electrocardiographic evidence of left atrial abnormality was associated with leukoaraiosis."

We examined the longitudinal association between the monetary value of the diet (MVD) and the overall dietary quality across sex, race and income groups.Longitudinal data from 1,466 adult urban participants from Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study were used. Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) and Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR) were computed and a national food price database was used to estimate MVD. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted linking annual rates of change (Δ) in MVD to ΔHEI-2010 and ΔMAR, stratifying by sex, race and income groups. Among key findings, ΔHEI-2010 was comparable across socio-demographic groups, while ΔMAR was higher among women and individuals above poverty. Adjusting for key covariates, ΔMVD was positively associated with both ΔHEI-2010 and ΔMAR, and with a consistently stronger association among individuals above poverty, specifically for the total proteins and empty calories components of HEI-2010 and several nutrient adequacy ratios (NARs: vitamins C, E, B-6 and Zinc). ΔMVD-ΔMAR association was stronger in women, mainly influenced by ΔMVD's positive associations with B-vitamins, copper, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus NARs. ΔMVD-Δvitamin D NAR's positive relationship was stronger among Whites, while ΔMVD-Δvitamin B-12 NAR's association was stronger among African-Americans.In sum, a potential increase in MVD may have a stronger impact on dietary quality among urban adult women and above-poverty individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2897646075,"Future increases in the intensity of heat waves (high heat and low water availability) are predicted to be one of the most significant impacts on organisms. Using six native grasses from Eastern Australia, we assessed their capacity to tolerate heat waves with low water availability. We were interested in understanding differential response between native grasses of differing photosynthetic pathways in terms of physiological and some molecular parameters to ecologically relevant summer heat waves that are associated with low rainfall. We used a simulation heatwave event in controlled temperature cabinets and investigated effects of the different treatments on four stress indicators: leaf senescence, leaf water content, photosynthetic efficiency and the relative expression of two heat shock proteins, Hsp70 and smHsp17.6. Leaf senescence was significantly greater under the combined stress treatment, while declines in leaf water content and photosynthetic efficiency were much larger for C3 than C4 plants, particularly under the combined stress treatment. Species showed an increase in expression of Hsp70 associated with heat treatment, rather than drought stress. In contrast Hsp17.6 was only detected in two species, responding to heat rather than drought, although species’ responses were variable. Overall, the C3 species were less tolerant than C4 species. Variation in individual plants within species was evident, especially under multiple stresses, and indicates that losses of individual plants may occur during a heat wave associated with this variability in tolerance. Heat waves will impose significant stress on plant communities that would not otherwise occur when heat and drought stress are experienced singly. Using ecologically relevant heat stress is likely to yield better predictability of how native plants will cope under a hotter, drier future."

The Nijmegen questionnaire (NQ), which measures severity of SH, had not previously been cross-culturally translated into Korean. In this study, the NQ was cross-culturally translated into Korean (KNQ), using translation and back-translation methods. To examine the reliability and validity levels of the KNQ, as well as its association with HRQoL, 237 college students (21.38 ± 2.45 years) were asked to complete the KNQ, the Korean version of the general health questionnaire (K-GHQ-30) and the short form-36 (K-SF-36). The KNQ showed satisfactory reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.878). In the construct validity test, four factors (neuropsychological, respiratory, neurogastrointestinal, and neuromuscular) were extracted (% of total variance = 59.8). Using a KNQ cut-off score of 23 points, the prevalence of SH was 22.8%. Physical and mental HRQoL levels estimated by the K-GHQ-30 score and the 8 subscale scores of the K-SF-36 were lower in the SH group than in those of the non-SH group. It is concluded that the cross-culturally translated KNQ is reliable and valid, and management of SH may prevent a reduction in physical and mental HRQoL in a young population."

The human brain contains billions of well-connected neurons. Neural neighborhoods perform different tasks: Some coordinate movement, whereas others hum along planning dinner. The mature brain is a complex assembly of networks, structures, and tracts. Like cities and their neighborhoods, however, the brain does not arise fully formed. Rather, operational patterns and developmental constraints guide the proliferating neurons that build the typical adult human brain. Just as cities are governed by both hard and soft infrastructure—e.g., highways channel traffic and laws define what sort of building can occur and where—the placement and function of neurons in the brain respond to multiple cues during development. In this special issue, we look behind the scenes of this elaborate process that places each neuron where it belongs or—sadly, in the cases of neurodevelopmental disorders—does not.

Generation of these neurons, along with the equally numerous accessory cells, requires enthusiastic progenitor cells. Early in development, straightforward proliferative programs morph to produce diverse cell types. With shifting cascades of transcription factors, each newborn neuron is shaped by its unique time and place.

Glia, originally viewed as bystanders in neurodevelopment, are now known to be quite the opposite. Radial glia are builders of both neural neighborhoods and highways along which neurons move. The immune system, once thought to be excluded from the brain, is also crucial to brain formation: Microglial cells regulate circuit formation and convey physiological information. Evolution constrains development according to successful precedents. Think about that with your marvelously formed brain.

https://openalex.org/W2896034849,"Background A multidisciplinary approach has been recommended for the management of patients with infective endocarditis. We evaluated the impact of multidisciplinary case conferences on morbidity, mortality, and quality of care for these patients. Methods We conducted a quasi-experimental study of consecutive patients admitted for infective endocarditis before (2013/10/1–2015/10/12, n = 97) and after (2015/10/13–2017/11/30, n = 80) implementation of case conferences to discuss medical and surgical management. These occurred as face-to-face discussions or electronically (for non-complex patients), and included physicians from cardiac surgery, cardiology, critical care, infectious diseases and neurology. We assessed process-of-care and clinical outcomes, with the primary outcome being complications up to 90 days after hospital discharge. Results A case conference was held for 80/80 (100%) of patients in the post-intervention group. After the intervention, more patients received inpatient cardiology assessment (81.3% [post-intervention] vs. 63.9% [pre-intervention], p = 0.01), and more patients with definite infective endocarditis underwent cardiac surgery treatment (44.6% vs. 21.7%, p = 0.007). All pre-intervention and post-intervention patients received guideline-concordant antimicrobial therapy. There was no difference in rates of complications (40.0% vs. 51.5%, p = 0.13) or mortality up to 90 days after hospital discharge (26.3% vs. 17.5%, p = 0.20). In multivariable analyses, the intervention was not associated with differences in mortality (odds ratio 1.87, 95% confidence interval 0.88–3.99) or a composite measure of complications and mortality (odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.46–1.58). Conclusion We successfully implemented a standardized multidisciplinary case conference protocol for patients with infective endocarditis.

> “I need to make myself visible as a single parent and to advocate for change.” 

I had my daughter several years before I had any thoughts of pursuing a scientific career. My marriage didn't work out, and I moved with my daughter from Russia to the United States. I started working at a tech company, where having a family did not feel out of the ordinary.

Once I entered the academic world, on the other hand, I found that speaking about my daughter with my colleagues and professors usually elicited surprise—or worse. When I finished my master's degree and decided to apply for a Ph.D., for example, a professor told me that pursuing a doctoral degree would be challenging in my “situation.”

In some ways, that professor was right. It is impossible to support myself and my daughter on the standard Ph.D. stipend. My university offers a student parent supplement, which helps, but I still struggle to pay the bills. I miss many social and professional development activities because I want to spend time with my daughter, and academic culture does not leave much room for personal time. Even if the events are scheduled at times when I can attend, going means that I have to work at night or on weekends to catch up.

Even so, I want to do science. Academic research shouldn't only be for people who have the privilege of time and money. So I'm pushing forward with my academic training.

I have also decided that, despite my discomfort and the potential for backlash, I need to make myself visible as a single parent and to advocate for change. I am not shy about telling people that sometimes I don't have money to pay rent. I started bringing my daughter to some social activities. I wrote an open letter to my department about the challenges that student parents face. I created a survey to gather more information about other student parents in the department.

I think my efforts are making some headway. (And, to be fair, my department is much more family-friendly than some others.) Emails about social events are now more likely to include explicit statements that family members, including kids, are welcome. My department chair is always willing to discuss any problems I might be having. Members of my department's graduate student association emailed me recently to ask for input about how they could use university wellness funds to support student parents.

Yet I still worry that my efforts make me more visible as a parent than as a scientist. In August, a fellow Ph.D. student wished me a happy Mother's Day. He is from Costa Rica, where they celebrate mothers at the end of the summer, and he thought that I would appreciate the sentiment—which I did. But it didn't alleviate my concerns about the reputation I'm creating for myself. Studies show that academic mothers tend to be viewed as less serious, whereas fathers are seen as more grounded and more organized.

I figure that, for a while, I will have to accept the fact that my role as a mother may be more interesting to some of my colleagues than my research. But I hold on to the hope that one day, thanks to my efforts and those of many others, grad student parenthood won't seem remarkable at all.
