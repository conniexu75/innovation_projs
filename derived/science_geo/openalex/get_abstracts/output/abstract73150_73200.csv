https://openalex.org/W2089682350,"Vinblastine quantitatively precipitates a protein from supernatants obtained from high-speed centrifugation of homogenates of HeLa cells and of pig brain. This protein migrates as a single band on gel electrophoresis, has a mobility identical to that of purified microtubule protein, and—like microtubule protein—binds colchicine. The precipitation is partially inhibited by 0.9 percent NaCl."

Immune adherence produced by the fourth component of complement is indistinguishable from classical immune adherence in terms of all parameters tested, except that it is entirely independent of the participation of the second and third components of complement."

The amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal portion of the glycine-rich, arginine-rich histone (Residues 1 to 49) has been determined from studies on the tryptic, chymotryptic, and thermolysin peptides. This sequence overlaps with that of the carboxylterminal portion (Residues 50 to 102) defined previously to give the following sequence: acetylSer-Gly-Arg-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly-Lys-Gly-Leu-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly-Ala-Lys(Ac)-Arg-His-Arg-Lys(Me)-Val-Leu-ArgAsp-Asn-Ile-Gln-Gly-Ile-Thr-Lys-Pro-Ala-Ile-Arg-Arg-Leu-Ala-Arg-Arg-Gly-Gly-Val-Lys-Arg-Ile-Ser-Gly-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Glu-Glu-Thr-Arg-Gly-Val-Leu-Lys-Val-Phe-Leu-Glu-Asn-Val-Ile-Arg-Asp-Ala-Val-Thr-Tyr-Thr-Glu-His-Ala-Lys-Arg-Lys-Thr-Val-Thr-Ala-Met-Asp-Val-Val-Tyr-Ala-Leu-Lys-Arg-Gln-Gly-Arg-Thr-Leu-Tyr-Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly-COOH. 2. This sequence agrees with that reported recently by DeLange, Fambrough, Smith, and Bonner (J. Biol. Chem., 244, 319 (1969)) except that the arginine residue they placed at position 44 is found in position 40 (and is italicized) in the above sequence. 3. Four clusters of basic residues (underlined) were present in this sequence. The cluster in the amino-terminal portion contained both the modified amino acids e-Nacetyllysine and e-N-methyllysine at positions 16 and 20. The acetyllysine was present in approximately half of the glycine-rich, arginine-rich histone molecules; the methylated lysine position contained mono and dimethyl groups in a ratio of 1:3. This microheterogeneity makes a total of four possible species of the glycine-rich, arginine-rich histone."

Triploid tumor cells were dissociated and transplanted into activated and enucleated eggs. Pluripotency of the implanted nuclei was evidenced by the formation of swimming triploid tadpoles.
https://openalex.org/W2080362466,"Melatonin in beeswax was implanted in male weasels (Mustela erminea). Brown weasels and white animals undergoing the spring change to the brown pelage and reproductive activity molted, grew a new white coat, and became reproductively quiescent after treatment. Controls retained or acquired the brown coat and developed or maintained enlarged testes. Treated weasels with pituitary autografts under the kidney capsule grew brown hair after hair growth was initiated by plucking. It is suggested that the pineal gland product, melatonin, initiates changes in the central nervous system and endocrines which result in molting, growth of the white winter pelage, and reproductive quiescence in the weasel."
https://openalex.org/W2025313479,"The phenotypes of serum α1-antitrypsin were determined by antigen-antibody crossed electrophoresis. There were five homozygotes and 25 heterozygotes for the deficiency gene found in a group of 103 patients with obstructive lung disease. The frequency of heterozygotes was 14 and 9 percent in two control groups with different mean ages of 36 and 80. There was only one heterozygote among 39 healthy males over 70 years of age. Heterozygosity may be a predisposing factor in chronic obstructive lung disease, especially in the male population."
https://openalex.org/W1547628858,"Abstract Purified bovine α-trypsin which contains an intrachain split between Lys-131 and Ser-132 was allowed to autodigest at pH 8.0 in 0.05 m CaCl2. A new species of trypsin slowly formed; it was isolated from the digest in fair yield by chromatography. The new trypsin was found to contain, in addition to the split of the parent molecule, a new intrachain split between Lys-176 and Asn-177. The affinity of the new form of trypsin for the positively charged ligands, benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester and benzamidine, was greatly decreased compared to the parent enzyme, whereas that for acetyl-l-tyrosine remained essentially unchanged. Furthermore, the new form of trypsin was alkylated by diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate with 1:1 stoichiometry, but was not affected by the specific irreversible inhibitor tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. These results are interpreted as indicating that the locus of the critical peptide chain split is near the cation-binding site for specific trypsin substrates."

Squamous carcinoma cells are deficient in nexuses although a rare nexus is seen. Nexuses may be involved in normal growth regulation, while a deficiency of nexuses may be related to the invasive property of malignant growth."

https://openalex.org/W1485714275,"Abstract The circular dichroism spectra of pancreatic ribonuclease A, RNase S, and RNase S-protein have been measured in the wave length interval 198 to 300 mµ under various conditions. The circular dichroism spectra of RNase A and S are very similar, possibly identical, over this entire wave length interval at neutral pH. That of RNase S-protein is substantially different. It is shown that the portion of the RNase A spectrum in the peptide-absorbing region may be fitted by assuming that 11.5% of the residues are in an α-helical conformation and 33% in a β-conformation. Two of the three characteristic bands of the α-helix (poly-α, L-glutamic acid) and both of the characteristic bands of the β-structure (poly-L-lysine) were not adjusted in any way. However, the shortest wave length α-helical band (192 mµ) and the random coil band at 198 mµ were allowed to vary, in intensity, for best fit. In addition, it was necessary to include a positive band at 226 mµ. Arguments justifying this inclusion are given and depend largely on the presence of a small band observed in native RNase A at or near 240 mµ. The latter is believed to result from overlap of the (assumed) positive band near 226 mµ and the much more intense negative bands due to peptide transitions. In RNase S-protein, the far ultraviolet bands are considerably diminished in intensity, but the maximum near 240 mµ is greatly intensified and shifted by 3 to 4 mµ to shorter wave lengths. It appears lively that the anomalous positive circular dichroism near 240 mµ is generated, or contributed to, by aromatic residues, some of which may be titratable tyrosines. However, titration, acetylation, and nitration results failed to establish this conclusively. A larger, negative, band at 275 mµ is shown, in agreement with others, to arise predominantly from tyrosine residues. In this case, also, modification experiments did not allow us to decide relative contributions to the band by exposed and masked tyrosine residues. There may also be a small component due to optically active disulfide transitions."

https://openalex.org/W1587660928,"Abstract A method is described for the isolation of a phytohemagglutinin from the meadow mushroom, Agaricus campestris. This protein was homogeneous by ultracentrifugation, cellulose acetate electrophoresis, and immunoelectrophoresis. The molecular weight as measured by sedimentation equilibrium was 64,000 and the sedimentation constant, s20,w = 4.8, was independent of protein concentration. There were no disulfide bonds but the hemagglutinin contained 4 buried sulfhydryl residues. About 4% of A. campestris hemagglutinin was carbohydrate. In the presence of dissociating solvents such as 6 m guanidine hydrochloride-0.1 m mercaptoethanol and 35% acetic acid-5 m urea the A. campestris hemagglutinin dissociated. In the guanidine hydrochloride-mercaptoethanol solvent the molecular weight was 16,000 as compared to 64,000 for the native protein. Because this protein contained no disulfide bonds, a noncovalently bonded structure consisting of four polypeptide chains is suggested. In 35% acetic acid-5 m urea, the protein showed two electrophoretic components in equal amounts, suggesting two different subunit types. Tryptic peptide analysis and amino acid composition gave results which were consistent with a molecule consisting of symmetrical halves. A four chain structure of the A2B2 type is proposed for the A. campestris hemagglutinin molecule."

Penicillin administration to pregnant does or newborn rabbits stimulated the developing transport system, but did not increase the peak observed at 4 weeks. Therefore the continued presence of substrate (penicillin) during development significantly enhances the rate of maturation."

https://openalex.org/W1599473790,"Abstract Circular dichroic (CD) spectra are reported for pancreatic ribonuclease A which has been reoxidized under various conditions, and for partially reduced forms of RNase A. Reoxidation of reduced RNase A in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol leads to a product averaging 83% of the enzymatic activity of native RNase but differing in CD spectral bands, most prominently in the vicinity of 240 mµ where native RNase exhibits a positive band and the reoxidized material does not. If the reoxidation is carried out in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, resultant enzymatic activities are about the same, but the anomalous CD spectrum near 240 mµ is not observed. RNase which has been reoxidized in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol can be fractionated on carboxymethyl Sephadex to yield two components, designated CMS-I and CMS-II. CMS-I is enzymatically inactive. CMS-II is fully active toward RNA. Its CD spectrum is identical with that of native RNase everywhere except near 240 mµ. With CMS-II, the positive band is present, but its intensity is only about half that of native RNase. The differences are amplified by cooling to below 5°. Calculated values of molecular ellipticity at 240 mµ for mixtures of CMS-I and CMS-II are similar to those observed with unfractionated reduced-reoxidized RNase; calculated values for mixtures of CMS-I and native RNase do not agree with the observed spectra. RNase, which, on the average, has one disulfide bond reduced, can be air-reoxidized in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol to a material whose CD spectrum is identical with that of RNase A. More extensive reduction, to an average of 4 sulfhydryl residues per molecule, yields on reoxidation a protein whose CD spectrum lacks the positive band at 240 mµ."

https://openalex.org/W2016201102,"Conditioned suppression of feeding, an index of fear, was increased rather than decreased by the administration of benzodiazepine tranquilizers or amobarbital. The drug-induced increase in conditioned fear varied directly with the intensity of the shock used in fear conditioning. The drugs had no fear-increasing effect in unshocked controls or in rats made amnesic by electroconvulsive shock given immediately after fear conditioning. These observations in animals are reminiscent of clinical reports that intraveneous amobarbital facilitates the recall of repressed traumatic experiences. The retrieval of painful memories may be inhibited or repressed in animals as well as in humans. In both cases, tranquilizers may counteract repression by disinhibition of the act of retrieval."

https://openalex.org/W2095499290,"THE beneficial effect of one fungus on another was first reported by Heald and Pool1 and has since been noted frequently. It was soon discovered that the contaminating organism supplied growth factors which the other organism failed to synthesize. Agaricus bisporus produces abundant sporophores in natural soil but not in aseptic environments. This suggests that certain microorganisms in soil trigger the formation of sporophores of A. bisporus. Fungi, bacteria, actinomycetes and yeasts were therefore isolated from the test soil and the role of these in the formation of sporophores was studied. It was interesting to find that only the presence of certain bacteria stimulated the formation of sporophores of A. bisporus. Using these bacteria or their metabolite(s), the production of mature sporophores of A. bisporus was achieved for the first time in aseptic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2002276978,"Treatment of highly purified preparations of the third component of complement (C3) with 0.5M hydroxylamine at 20 degrees C for 15 to 30 minutes, followed by acidification, resulted in dissociation of a peptide from the C3 molecule. The isolated fragment (molecular weight, 7600) resembled enzymatically liberated anaphylatoxin (C3a) with respect to size, charge, amino acid composition, and biological activity. Its capacity to contract smooth muscle was inhibitable by antihistamines; it also produced tachyphylaxis and desensitization of the guinea pig ileum to C3a. Thus native C3 probably contains an esterlike bond and hydroxylamine-liberated anaphylatoxin may represent one of the polypeptide chains of the C3 molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1594698128,"Abstract Flavin adenine dinucleotide has been dissociated from pig heart lipoamide dehydrogenase in the presence of 1.5 m guanidine hydrochloride. Measurements of the circular dichroism on the apoenzyme show evidence of a large change in conformation, based on the molar ellipticity in the region 240 to 200 mµ. When FAD is removed from the holoenzyme in guanidine, but in the presence of approximately equimolar FMN, no change appears in the circular dichroism of the apoenzyme in the 200 mµ region. The ultraviolet absorption of the apoprotein indicates that no FMN remains bound to the apoenzyme. Either FMN stabilizes the protein in the presence of guanidine or, after the loss of FAD, promotes the return of a conformationally different species to the native form of the enzyme. Lipoamide dehydrogenase activity is reconstituted in the presence of FAD and dithiothreitol."

The persistence of these fragments through numerous generations of cells confirmed the holokinetic nature of the milkweed bug chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1636753731,"Abstract Ultraviolet difference spectra are produced by the binding of bivalent metal ions to metal-free phosphoglucomutase. The changes in extinction at 286 and 293 mµ thus produced involve a 1:1 metal-binding stoichiometry. Solvent perturbation studies indicate that the conformation change produced by metal ion binding is relatively minor in magnitude. Thus only 90% D2O perturbs more residues in the free enzyme than in the binary enzyme·Zn complex, while 20% solutions of dimethylsulfoxide, ethylene glycol, or 1,2-propanediol perturb the same number of residues in both forms of the enzyme. A comparison of the ultraviolet difference spectra generated by the addition of various bivalent cations, viz. Mg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+, reveals no metal-specific differences in the structure of the various binary enzyme·metal complexes and thus suggests that all of these metal ions produce the same structural alteration on binding to the enzyme. This observation is supported by a comparison of solvent perturbation spectra of several of the binary enzyme·metal complexes with a variety of perturbants. Phosphoglucomutase contains 14 to 15 tyrosines and four to five tryptophans as deduced by a comparison of the ultraviolet spectra of native enzyme with that of a solution of enzyme in 6 M guanidine·HCl."

https://openalex.org/W1540343205,"Abstract A comparison was made of some physicochemical properties of yeast iso-1-ferricytochrome c and the horse protein. Two heme-linked ionizations of yeast iso-1-ferricytochrome c were followed spectrophotometrically. A pK of 3.1 was estimated for the acid ionization corresponding to the disruption of the two iron-protein bonds, and a pK of 8.1 was found for the weakly alkaline ionization accompanied by the disappearance of the 695 mµ absorption band. Comparison between these and the known analogous pK values for horse cytochrome c indicates that the closed crevice of the yeast protein is weaker to the extent of about 1 kcal per mole. The kinetics and equilibrium of the reaction of yeast iso-1-ferricytochrome c with cyanide were studied. The reaction shows the same characteristics as those found for the horse protein. The derived thermodynamic parameters for the association with CN- are ΔF = -7.6 kcal per mole, ΔH= = -12.9 kcal per mole, and ΔS = -17.8 e.u. The more favorable enthalpy and less favorable entropy changes than for the reaction with horse cytochrome c indicate that in the yeast protein the noncovalent interactions between various residues of the polypeptide chain are weaker and the molecule possesses more degrees of freedom."
https://openalex.org/W1531127753,"Abstract Association of α-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine with lysozyme has been studied over the pH range 4.5 to 8.0, at 4.9° and 22°, Γ/2 = 0.2. Measurements were made under conditions whereby the concentration of β-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine was relatively negligible. Experimental values of the apparent binding constant, Kap, are essentially temperature-independent above pH 7, but become markedly temperature-dependent at lower pH. Kap is much more strongly pH-dependent at 4.9° than at 22°, where the pH dependence is barely significant. The pH dependence of the binding constants may be quantitatively accounted for by assuming that at least two ionizable groups on the enzyme are intimately involved in the binding process. Unique pK values for these groups cannot be assigned, however. The pH dependence of Kap is strikingly different from that observed for the binding of β-d-1-O-methyl-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine to lysozyme, a molecule which competes for the same site on the enzyme (Biochemistry, 7, 3277 (1968)). It is argued that this difference in the pH dependence of Kap reflects a subtle difference between the geometric orientations of the monosaccharides at the binding site."

The [4-isoleucine]-oxytocin and [4-leucine]-oxytocin were tested for a number of biological activities, [4-Isoleucine]-oxytocin possesses about 16% of the avian vasodepressor, 7% of the oxytocic, and 45% of the milk-ejecting activities of oxytocin. This analogue possesses negligible pressor and antidiuretic activities. [4-Leucine]-oxytocin possesses approximately 9% of the avian vasodepressor, 2.5% of the oxytocic, and 16% of the milk-ejecting activities of oxytocin. This analogue has no antidiuretic activity. It has a weak and inconsistent depressor effect on the blood pressure. [4-Isoleucine]-oxytocin and [4-leucine]-oxytocin are both considerably less potent than [4-valine]-oxytocin with respect to their avian vasodepressor, oxytocic, and milk-ejecting activities. Of particular interest is the fact that [4-leucine]-oxytocin exhibits in the rat a potent diuretic and natriuretic effect. Futhermore, it inhibits the antidiuretic activity of arginine-vasopressin."

https://openalex.org/W1598681348,"Abstract Triiodothyroacetic acid is a competitive inhibitor of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase with respect to the coenzyme. The Ki value for triiodothyroacetic acid in this system is 1.3 to 1.9 µM. Triiodothyroacetic acid appears to interact with a hydrophobic portion of the protein since it is able to displace the hydrophobic compound, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid from liver alcohol dehydrogenase. Triiodothyroacetic acid also displaces hydrophobic probes from human globin and bovine serum albumin. The difference spectrum of triiodothyroacetic acid bound to liver alcohol dehydrogenase is very similar to that observed for triiodothyroacetic acid in solvents less polar than water. Yonetani-Theorell plots show that triiodothyroacetic acid binds at the adenosine diphosphate ribose portion of the coenzyme binding site and that bound triiodothyroacetic acid restricts the binding of metal chelators to the zinc of the active center. It is therefore concluded that the adenosine diphosphate ribose portion of the active center resides in a hydrophobic area of the protein and that this area is near the zinc of the active center."
