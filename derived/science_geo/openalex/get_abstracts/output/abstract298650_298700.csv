https://openalex.org/W2031104793,"This year, 1976, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded for research in pure inorganic chemistry, in particular the boranes. May I say that I am most pleased and profoundly grateful. My own orientation to this field has been, as it has in all of my studies, the relationships of the chemical behavior of molecules to their three-dimensional geometrical and electronic structures. The early work on the molecular structures of boranes by X-ray diffraction led to a reasonable basis for a theory of chemical bonding different from that which is typical in carbon chemistry, and yielded an understanding of the pleasing polyhedral-like nature of these compounds. Assimilated by the preparative chemists, the principles helped to establish a large body of a hitherto unknown chemistry, which made a reality of the expectation that boron, next to carbon in the periodic table, should indeed have a complex chemistry. In these nearly thirty years both the theoretical and experimental methods have been applied by us and others to areas of inorganic, physical, organic and biochemistry. For examples, these areas include low temperature X-ray diffraction techniques, and the theoretical studies of multicentered chemical bonds including both delocalized and localized molecular orbitals. An early example is extended Huckel theory, originally developed for studies of the boranes, and even now one of the most widely applicable approximate methods for theoretical studies of bonding in complex molecules. More soundly based theories are presently in use by my research students for studying how enzymes catalyze reactions, details of which are based on the three-dimensional structures by X-ray diffraction methods. Besides illuminating particular problems, these developments may contribute toward the redefinition of areas of chemisttry, and thereby broaden the chemist’s view. Our research in the boranes and their related molecular species crosses areas of inorganic, experimental physical, theoretical and organic chemistry, and includes applications in biochemistry. More simply stated, the area is the study of the relationships of molecular structure to function. BORANES, AND EARLY STRUCTURE STUDIES By now, large numbers of chemical compounds related to polyborane chemistry exist: boron hydrides, carboranes, metalloboranes, metallocarboranes, mixed compounds with organic moieties, and others. These discoveries of preparative chemists are relatively recent. Long ago, Alfred Stock established borane chemistry. He developed the experimental techniques which were required"

https://openalex.org/W2054413054,The semiconductor liquid junction cell n-GaAs/0.8M K2Se-0.1M K2Se2-1M KOH/C has been shown to attain 9 percent photovoltaic power conversion efficiency in sunlight. Accelerated tests under 3100°K light sources of several solar intensities indicate very low photocorrosion currents and high output stability.

https://openalex.org/W2003196785,"Attenuation of seismic waves indicates that the earth is not perfectly elastic. Dispersion accompanying absorption gives frequency-dependent ""elastic"" moduli, a fact that must be taken into account when inverting seismic data. Normal mode data are reinverted after correcting for absorption. The correction removes the discrepancy between body wave and free oscillation interpretations of earth structure."
https://openalex.org/W1973963401,"Identical chemical compounds are present in the Dufour gland secretion of female Andrena bees and in the cephalic secretion of many male Nomada bees. Females of Nomada parasitize the nests of Andrena. Many Nomada species confine their attacks to a single host species. In two such host-parasite pairs, Andrena haemorrhoa-Nomada bifida and Andrena carantonica-Nomada marshamella, all-trans farnesyl hexanoate was found to be the totally dominant component in respective secretions. In two other pairs, Andrena helvola-Nomada panzeri and Andrena clarkella-Nomada leucophthalma, geranyl octanoate is the major component. This pairwise odor correspondence is discussed in relation to critical points of contact in the life cycles of host and parasite, male and female."
https://openalex.org/W2010741900,"Petrolacosaurus, an Upper Pennsylvanian reptile, presents a combination of features that place it within a distinct family of the Eosuchia while also evidencing strong relationships to the ancestral reptiles. It is therefore the earliest and most primitive representative of the largest assemblage of fossil and living reptiles, collectively called diapsids."

https://openalex.org/W2134558712,"Catalytic reactions of carbon monoxide with hydrogen have been studied in which intermetallic compounds of the formula MNi(5) (where M is thorium, uranium, or zirconium) have been used as the catalysts. The materials perform effectively as methanation catalysts; ThNi(5) has a specific activity exceeding that of a typical commercial oxide-supported methanation catalyst by a factor of about 5. This material also shows superior resistance to hydrogen sulfide poisoning. Nickel, formed as a decomposition product of the MNi(5) intermetallic compound, is probably the active species, but its properties are influenced by the nature of M in the precursor MNi(5) system."

https://openalex.org/W4244791411,The 115-gigahertz microwave line of carbon monoxide has been detected in the spectrum of Mars. The measurement is sensitive to carbon monoxide between the surface and an altitude of approximately 50 kilometers in the martian atmosphere. This extends the altitude region to well above that previously sensed.
https://openalex.org/W2040605530,"""Forward-looking"" infrared measurements of water vapor from the C-141A Kuiper Airborne Observatory of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center show large, distinctly identifiable, signal anomalies from 4 to 10 minutes in advance of subsequent encounters with clear air turbulence (CAT). These anomalies are characteristically different from the signals not followed by CAT encounters. Results of airborne field trials in which the infrared radiometer was used indicate that, out of 51 situations, 80 percent were CAT alerts followed by CAT encounters, 12 percent were ""false alarms"" (CAT alerts not followed by CAT encounters), and 8 percent were CAT encounters not preceded by an infrared signal anomaly or CAT alert."
https://openalex.org/W2051043169,The relative migration ratio of plutonium in various rocks is approximately 100 micrometers per meter of waterflow; the corresponding migration ratio for americium is about 500 micrometers per meter of water flow. Under these conditions radioactive decay will have taken place to such an extent that little plutonium and americium can reach the external environment from a well-designed and isolated geological repository site.

https://openalex.org/W2061009652,"An equal dichotomy of an angiosperm vegetative apex, previously suspected on morphological grounds, is demonstrated both externally in whole apices and in histological preparations. Dichotomy is a normal developmental feature with complete continuity in growth from the simple to the bifurcated state. The accessibility of this rare phenomenon in this plant makes further, possibly experimental, approaches feasible."
