https://openalex.org/W2069007287,"The feeding of ethanol increased significantly the activities of hepatic pentobarbital and benzpyrene hydroxylases in rats, and, in human volunteers, doubled pentobarbital hydroxylase activity. In vitro ethanol inhibited aniline, pentobarbital, and benzpyrene hydroxylases. These data may explain, at least in part, the increased tolerance of alcoholics to sedatives when sober, and the enhanced sensitivity to sedatives when inebriated."

https://openalex.org/W1541166329,"Abstract Cytochrome b5 was solubilized with detergents and purified to an essentially homogeneous state from rabbit liver microsomes. The purified hemoprotein, called b5, had a molecular weight of about 25,000 and existed in solution as an oligomer, which could be depolymerized in 4.5 m urea. Tryptic digestion of detergent b5 yielded a hemoprotein which was identical with cytochrome b5 purified from the tryptic digest of microsomes. It was concluded that cytochrome b5 preparations hitherto purified are protease-resistant cores of the native hemoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W47016903,"Diphosphoglycerate mutase has been purified from the red blood cells of rabbits and humans. The enzyme is found only in the soluble fraction of human red cell hemolysates at an average level of 0.93 unit per ml of packed cells. The stoichiometry has been verified as: 1,3-PGA + 3-PGA → 2,3-PGA + 3-PGA where PGA is phosphoglyceric acid. The kinetic studies with the human enzyme indicate Km values of 0.53 µ M for 1,3-diphosphoglycerate and 1 to 1.5 µ M for 3-phosphoglycerate. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate is a competitive inhibitor of 1,3-diphosphoglycerate with a Ki of 0.85 µ M ; it is noncompetitive with 3-phosphoglycerate. Inorganic phosphate inhibits competitively with 3-phosphoglycerate with a Ki of 314 µ M . The Km of 1,3-diphosphoglyceric acid is independent of the level of 3-phosphoglycerate. An ordered bimolecular reaction is proposed in which 1,3-diphosphoglycerate combines with free enzyme, followed by the combination with 3-phosphoglycerate to form a ternary complex. After conversion to the products, 3-phosphoglycerate is released before 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Diphosphoglycerate mutase is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents and purified fractions require the addition of mercaptoethanol for optimal activity. Phosphoglycolic acid is stimulatory at levels below 0.4 m M and inhibitory at higher levels. 2-Phosphoglycerate is an activator of the reaction. It decreases the Km of 3-phosphoglycerate and increases the over-all activity of the enzyme. 2-Phosphoglyceric acid also acts as a phosphate acceptor in the over-all reaction to produce 2,3-diphosphoglycerate."

https://openalex.org/W1502993156,"Abstract The reaction of the extracellular nuclease of Staphylococcus aureus with tetranitromethane yields an inactive enzyme containing 5 nitrotyrosyl residues. If nitration is performed in the presence of deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and Ca++, enzymatic activity is preserved and only 2 or 3 tyrosyl residues are nitrated. Reaction of the nuclease with a small molar excess of tetranitromethane results in selective nitration of the tyrosine residue at position 85. This mononitrotyrosyl nuclease can be purified on phosphorylated cellulose columns and is catalytically inactive. When the reaction of nuclease with small amounts of tetranitromethane is carried out in the presence of deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and Ca++ very little nitration of tyrosine 85 occurs, and instead the tryosyl residue at position 115 is selectively nitrated. Tyrosine 115 is unreactive to nitration in the native enzyme, even with a large excess of tetranitromethane. The mononitrotyrosyl 115 nuclease can also be purified on phosphorylated cellulose. It has full deoxyribonuclease activity, but has lost half of the native ribonuclease activity. Nitration of tyrosine 115 causes tyrosine 85 to lose its specific reactivity to nitration, although this residue remains exposed to solvent and is still nitratable. This effect is probably due to an alteration in some specific interaction between these 2 tyrosine residues rather than to a structural change in the protein. The 2 tyrosyl residues thus appear to be spatially adjacent. Judged principally from spectral studies, tyrosine 115 in the native enzyme appears to be in a hydrophobic region where it is inaccessible to nitration. Binding of substrate appears to cause exposure of this residue to an aqueous environment since its ultraviolet spectrum and pK are normalized, and since it becomes accessible to nitration. These results suggest that a conformational change at the active site may result upon binding of deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate to nuclease. In addition to tyrosyl residues 85 and 115, the one at position 27 may also be in the active site, since its nitration is specifically inhibited by deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and Ca++. The possible functional role of this residue could not be determined, since it could not be selectively nitrated. The 2 unreactive or buried tyrosyl residues of nuclease are probably those at positions 91 and 93, and nitration of these, after protection by reversible acetylation of the other 5 tyrosine residues, does not appear to affect enzymatic activity significantly. The 2 mononitrotyrosyl (115 and 85) derivatives can easily be reduced with sodium dithionite to the corresponding aminotyrosyl derivatives. The latter, owing to the low pK value (4.7) of their aromatic amino groups, can be used for further selective chemical substitutions, such as with the fluorescent dye, dimethylaminonaphthalenesulfonyl chloride, or with p-iodobenzenesulfonyl chloride. The single tryptophanyl residue of nuclease reacts with tetranitromethane to form a yellow derivative, provided this ordinarily buried residue is exposed to the reagent by guanidine hydrochloride or urea."
https://openalex.org/W54343264,"Abstract A staphylococcal nuclease (strain Foggi), very similar in chemical structure to the enzyme from strain V8, is cleaved in a limited way by trypsin in the presence of deoxythymidine-3',5'-diphosphate and Ca++. Such treatment yields fragments P1 (residues 1 to 5), P2 (residues 6 to 48), P3 (P3a, residues 49 to 149; and P3b, 50 to 149), and free lysine (residue 49). None of the products shows enzymatic activity. However, Fragments P2 and P3 (either P3a or P3b) associate to form an active, noncovalently bonded derivative, nuclease-T. Evidence is presented to show that the cleavage of the peptide bonds in nuclease between residues 48 and 49 or between 49 and 50, but not the bond between residues 5 and 6, account for the decreased enzymatic activity and heat stability observed with nuclease-T."

https://openalex.org/W2034226260,"Abstract From a single amethopterin-resistant organism, Streptococcus faecium var. durans strain A, two different dihydrofolate reductases have been obtained as essentially homogeneous proteins in good yield. One of the reductases has a similar substrate specificity and turnover number (about 8000 moles per min per mole of enzyme) to the single reductase found in the amethopterin-sensitive strain of S. faecium var. durans, ATCC 8043, and has therefore been designated type. The other enzyme, which is distinguished by its ability to catalyze the reduction of folate, in addition to dihydrofolate, and by its lower turnover number (about 900 with dihydrofolate), has been designated type. Since the wild type and mutant type reductases have sedimentation constants (s20,buffer) of 2.58 S and 2.04 S, respectively, they are probably significantly different in molecular weight. Each exhibits a single pH optimum at pH 5.8 and is inactivated by urea. Neither is affected by methylmercuric salts but the wild type reductase is inactivated by phenyl-mercuric acetate and p-mercuribenzoate. Monovalent cations increase the activity of the mutant type reductase but decrease that of the wild type reductase. It is suggested that the amethopterin resistance in vivo of strain A depends at least partly on the folate reductase activity of the mutant type reductase."

The reaction requires a divalent cation (preferably Mg++ or Mn++) and a nucleoside triphosphate. Optimal activity was obtained with ATP. Phosphorylation of deoxycytidine was competitively inhibited by both proximal (dCMP) and distal (dCDP and dCTP) end products and by cytosine arabinoside. Phosphorylation of the latter compound was also shown. Deoxycytidine kinase was relatively insensitive to —SH inhibitors and to surface active agents. An approximate molecular weight of 60,000 was found."

https://openalex.org/W1969952876,"There are two classes of photoreceptor cells in the median ocellus of Limulus. One class of cells respond to long wavelength (visible) stimuli with a depolarizing receptor potential and to near ultraviolet light with a biphasic, initially hyperpolarizing, receptor potential. The other class of receptors respond with a depolarization to near ultraviolet and with a biphasic response to visible light. In the latter type of cell, visible light can counteract the depolarization elicited by near ultraviolet light. The evidence suggests that there are two photopigments in each cell and that both are involved in the generation of receptor potential."

https://openalex.org/W1520819629,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of the nuclease produced by the Foggi strain of Staphylococcus aureus is being determined as part of a study comparing it with V8 strain nuclease. Amino acid analyses and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy have suggested that Foggi strain enzyme contains 4 histidine residues, in contrast to the 3 known to be present in the V8 strain material. In the course of analyzing the cyanogen bromide fragments of Foggi nuclease, a 13-residue tryptic peptide was isolated which is identical with the corresponding V8 peptide except for replacement of the leucine residue at position 124 by histidine. In addition, the cyanogen bromide fragments are assigned to their positions in the chain with the help of the overlapping series of fragments of nuclease-T, this being an enzymatically active product of limited trypsin digestion of nuclease composed of two large peptide fragments held together by noncovalent interactions. It is concluded that the two nuclease molecules are very similar and that the replacement of leucine 124 (V8) by histidine (Foggi) is compatible with an active conformation."

https://openalex.org/W144874871,"Abstract 14C-Formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) and γ-32P-ATP (or 14C-ATP) bind to FGAR amidotransferase to form a complex, which may be isolated by Sephadex gel filtration and characterized. The formation of this complex is dependent on the presence of three components, FGAR, ATP, and magnesium ions, but does not require glutamine. The binding sites for FGAR and ATP on the enzyme molecule may be distinguished from that of glutamine. The binding ratio of either FGAR or ATP to the enzyme expressed in molar quantity was approximately 0.7 under the conditions used at pH 6.5. The ratio of FGAR to ATP bound to the enzyme was unity. The analysis of the radioactive materials obtained from the complex of FGAR and γ-32P-ATP with the enzyme indicated that the terminal phosphoanhydride bond of ATP was cleaved to ADP and a phosphate moiety, which remained bound to the enzyme presumably in ester linkage. Furthermore, when the enzyme was incubated with 14C-ATP in the presence of MgCl2, an amount of 14C-ADP nearly equivalent to the moles of enzyme present was obtained. FGAR did not affect this reaction. These results and others including observations on an ATP-ADP exchange reaction indicate strongly that the enzyme itself is phosphorylated in a step of the over-all reaction catalyzed by FGAR amidotransferase. Azaserine and iodoacetate, both of which reacted at the glutamine-binding site, reduced and enhanced, respectively, the stability of the FGAR-ATP-enzyme complex. However, these compounds did not affect the true binding ratios of the substrates. Although both compounds inhibited the reaction in which glutamine was the nitrogen donor, azaserine stimulated and iodoacetate partially inhibited the reaction with ammonium chloride as the nitrogen donor. A mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by FGAR amidotransferase has been discussed on the basis of the above information. The over-all reaction has been broken down into partial reactions, which, however, operate in a highly coordinated manner with one another."

The highly purified preparation showed a single component in the ultracentrifuge. The molecular weight of the enzyme was found to be about 133,000 with a sedimentation coefficient of 6.5 S. The enzyme is rapidly denatured by alkaline or thermal treatment. This denaturation, however, is completely prevented by the addition of all of the substrates and cofactors of the enzyme and partially by various combinations of these substrates and cofactor. The equivalence of the products formed in the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme was studied by the use of various assay procedures. For the formation of 1 mole of formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide, a product of the reaction, 1 mole each of glutamine and of ATP was converted to glutamate and to ADP and orthophosphate, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2004966824,"SHAW et al.1–3 are at present carrying out valuable new work on the chemistry of resistant spore wall materials of the general class of sporopollenins following the pioneer studies of Zetzsche's group in the 1930s4. Shaw and Yeadon1,2 have concluded, from observations on the pollen of Pinus sylvestris and Lycopodium clavatum, that sporopollenin contains a lignin-like fraction of 10–25 per cent and a lipid fraction of 75–90 per cent. They have explained the lack of reactivity of the lignin component by the suggestion that it is masked by the lipid moiety, or present in some unusual combination. Brooks and Shaw3 have proposed that the precursors of sporopollenin in the anthers of Lilium henryi are carotenoids, and that the exine is formed by oxidative polymerization of the mixture of carotenoids and carotenoid esters contained in the anther material."
