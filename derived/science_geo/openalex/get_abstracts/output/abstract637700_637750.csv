This is in part because these materials have larger bandgaps. The cubic crystal phases of these materials also exhibit poor stability. Wang et al. synthesized the tetragonal β-phase of CsPbI 3 from HPbI 3 and CsI. The material exhibited higher stability and a more favorable bandgap, which allowed for PCEs of 15%. Passivation of the surface trap state with choline iodide boosted PCEs to 18%. Science , this issue p. 591"

Improving energy density and other properties may help these materials be more competitive with batteries for energy storage applications. Pan et al. introduced a specific type of nanodomain structure in a BiFeO 3 -BaTiO 3 -SrTiO 3 solid solution that dramatically increased the energy density. The nanodomains were organized so as to minimize energy loss during polarization switching. The enhancement in the dielectric properties suggests that the strategy may be useful for designing high-performance dielectrics. Science , this issue p. 578"
https://openalex.org/W2967948480,"Quantum entanglement involving coherent superpositions of macroscopically distinct states is among the most striking features of quantum theory, but its realization is challenging, since such states are extremely fragile. Using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays with interactions mediated by Rydberg states, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of 'Schr\""odinger cat' states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 20 qubits. Our approach is based on engineering the energy spectrum and using optimal control of the many-body system. We further demonstrate entanglement manipulation by using GHZ states to distribute entanglement to distant sites in the array, establishing important ingredients for quantum information processing and quantum metrology."

At late stages of AD, pathological Aβ accumulations cause neurodegeneration and cell death. However, neuronal dysfunction, consisting of an excessively increased activity in a fraction of brain neurons, already occurs in early stages of the disease. Zott et al. explored the cellular basis of this hyperactivity in mouse models of AD (see the Perspective by Selkoe). Aβ-mediated hyperactivation was linked to a defect in synaptic transmission exclusively in active neurons, with the most-active neurons having the highest risk of hyperactivation. Aβ-containing brain extracts from human AD patients sustained this vicious cycle, underscoring the potential relevance of this pathological mechanism in humans.

Yet decades after the gene's discovery, the biology of cancer-associated missense mutations in p53 is still being debated. Previous studies have suggested that missense mutations confer tumor-promoting functions to p53. Boettcher et al. conducted a detailed analysis of p53 missense mutations in human leukemia, drawing on methodologies including genome editing, a p53 saturation mutagenesis screen, mouse models, and clinical data (see the Perspective by Lane). They found no evidence that p53 missense mutations confer an oncogenic gain of function. Rather, the mutations exerted a dominant-negative effect that reduced the tumor suppressor activity of wild-type p53. Science , this issue p. 599 ; see also p. 539"

Blazejewski et al. developed a computational algorithm to predict de novo sequence entanglement and experimentally generated functional synthetic overlapping genes.

https://openalex.org/W2968454831,"Awareness of task demands is often used during rehabilitation and sports training by providing instructions which appears to accelerate learning and improve performance through explicit motor learning. However, the effects of awareness of perturbations on the changes in estimates of hand position resulting from motor learning are not well understood. In this study, people adapted their reaches to a visuomotor rotation while either receiving instructions on the nature of the perturbation, experiencing a large rotation, or both to generate awareness of the perturbation and increase the contribution of explicit learning. We found that instructions and/or larger rotations allowed people to activate or deactivate part of the learned strategy at will and elicited explicit changes in open-loop reaches, while a small rotation without instructions did not. However, these differences in awareness, and even manipulations of awareness and perturbation size, did not appear to affect learning-induced changes in hand-localization estimates. This was true when estimates of the adapted hand location reflected changes in proprioception, produced when the hand was displaced by a robot, and also when hand location estimates were based on efferent-based predictions of self-generated hand movements. In other words, visuomotor adaptation led to significant shifts in predicted and perceived hand location that were not modulated by either instruction or perturbation size. Our results indicate that not all outcomes of motor learning benefit from an explicit awareness of the task. Particularly, proprioceptive recalibration and the updating of predicted sensory consequences appear to be largely implicit.

https://openalex.org/W2968010842,"Cognitive deficits are frequently found after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but their influence on return to work is largely unknown. To improve identification of those patients at-risk for long-term return to work problems, we aimed to examine the value of cognitive deficits in the prediction of long-term return to work after subarachnoid hemorrhage.SAH patients (N = 71) who were employed before SAH and were able to undergo neuropsychological assessment, were included. Demographic characteristics and acute SAH-related variables (SAH-type and external cerebrospinal fluid drainage) were taken into account. Neuropsychological tests for memory, speed, attention, executive function, and emotion recognition and a questionnaire for executive functions were used. Return to work was assessed using the Role Resumption List.Results showed that patients with incomplete return to work had significantly lower scores on neuropsychological measures for complex attention and executive functions (p < 0.05) compared to patients with complete return to work. Return to work could not be significantly predicted using only demographic characteristics and acute SAH-related variables, but adding measures of complex attention and executive functions resulted in a prognostic model that could reliably distinguish between complete and incomplete return to work. Statistically significant predictors in the final model were cerebrospinal fluid drainage and scores on a questionnaire for executive functions: patients with cerebrospinal fluid drainage and higher scores on the a questionnaire for executive functions were less likely to return to work.Together, these findings show that neuropsychological measures, especially for complex attention and executive functions, have added value to acute SAH-related and demographic variables in the prediction of long-term return to work after SAH."
https://openalex.org/W2967590586,"Wetlands are recognized as one of the most important natural environments for humans. At the same time, heavy metal pollution has an important impact on wetlands. China's Raoyanghe Wetland is one of the most important natural wild species gene banks in China. Eight heavy metal elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in surface layer and deep layer soils were analyzed using statistical-, pollution index-, and Nemerow index-based methods, the Hakanson potential ecological risk index method, and principal component and cluster analyses. The results showed that the maximum concentrations of heavy metals exceeded the background values in the core area and buffer zone of the wetland, but the heavy metal content of the soils was generally low and did not exceed 30%. With the exception of Hg, heavy metal concentrations showed strong spatial differentiation. The differences between the surface layer and deep layer soils of the core area were smaller than in the buffer zone. With the exception of Cd, a clear vertical zonation in the buffer zone soils was observed, showing greater evidence of external influences in this zone than the core. With the exception of partial surface soils, which indicated a safe level of pollution in the core area, all other soils were classified as having a ‘mild’ level of pollution. Thus, the wetland is moderately polluted, with both the core area and the buffer zone presenting a low level of potential ecological risk. According to the results of the present study, heavy metal contaminants in the wetland soils were found to be derived mainly from the natural sources."
https://openalex.org/W2968407320,"Introduction Depressive emotions can lead to subsequent unhealthy behaviors such as Internet addiction, especially in female adolescents; therefore, studies that examine the relationships among depression, health‑related behaviors, and Internet addiction in female adolescents are warranted. Purpose To examine (1) the relationship between depression and health-related behaviors and (2) the relationship between depression and Internet addiction. Method A cross-sectional study design was adopted using a structured questionnaire to measure depression, health-related behaviors, and Internet addiction in female adolescents. The data were collected from students of a junior college in southern Taiwan using convenience sampling to select the participants. The questionnaire was divided into four sections: demographics, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile (HPLP), and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT). Results The final sample comprised 503 female junior college students, with the participants mainly aged between 15 to 22 years (mean age = 17.30 years, SD = 1.34). Regarding the HPLP scores, the overall score, nutrition subscale score, and self-actualization subscale score were significantly and negatively associated with the CES-D depression score (p < 0.05–0.01). In other words, depression level was lower in students who exhibited more healthy behaviors, put more emphasis on dietary health, and had higher levels of self-admiration and confidence toward life. Regarding the IAT scores, the overall score and six domain scores were all positively associated (p < 0.01) to the CES-D depression score. In other words, the higher an individual’s Internet addiction score was, the higher her depression level was. Conclusions The results confirmed the relationship between depression, health-related behaviors, and Internet addiction. The cultivation of health-related behaviors may help in lowering depressive symptoms. Teenagers with depression have higher risks of developing Internet addiction, and such addiction is likely to affect their daily functioning."
https://openalex.org/W2968389279,"Background Increasingly Burden of Disease (BOD) measures are being used to influence policy decisions because they summarise the complete effects of morbidity and mortality in an equitable manner. An important element of producing non-fatal BOD estimates are severity distributions. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study use the same severity distributions across countries due to a lack of available country-specific data. In the Scottish BOD (SBOD) study we developed national severity distributions for cancer types. The main aim of this study was to consider the extent to which the use of worldwide severity distributions in BOD studies are influencing cross-country comparisons, by comparing weighted-average disability weights (DW) based on GBD severity distributions with nationally derived severity distributions in Scotland for cancer types. Methods We obtained individual records from the Scottish Cancer Registry for 21 cancer types and linked these to registered deaths. We estimated prevalent cancer cases for 2016 and assigned each case to sequelae using GBD 2016 study definitions. We compared the impact of using severity distributions based on GBD 2016, a Scotland-wide distribution, and distributions specific to deprivation strata in Scotland, on the weighted-average DW for each cancer type. Results The relative difference in point estimates of weighted-average DW based on GBD 2016 worldwide severity distributions compared with Scottish national severity distributions resulted in overestimates in the majority of cancers (17 out of 21 cancer types). The largest overestimates were for gallbladder and biliary tract cancer (70.8%), oesophageal cancer (31.6%) and pancreatic cancer (31.2%). Furthermore, the use of weighted-average DW based on Scottish national severity distributions rather than sub-national Scottish severity distributions stratified by deprivation quintile overestimated weighted-average DW in the least deprived areas (16 out of 18 cancer types), and underestimated in the most deprived areas (16 out of 18 cancer types). Conclusion Our findings illustrate a bias in point estimates of weighted-average DW created using worldwide severity distributions. This bias would have led to the misrepresentation of non-fatal estimates of the burden of individual cancers, and underestimated the scale of socioeconomic inequality in this non-fatal burden. This highlights the importance of not interpreting non-fatal estimates of burden of disease too precisely, especially for sub-national estimates and those comparing populations when relying on data inputs from other countries. It is essential to ensure that any estimates are based upon country-specific data as far as possible."
https://openalex.org/W2968242297,"Despite the recent malaria burden reduction in the Americas, focal transmission persists across the Amazon Basin. Timely analysis of surveillance data is crucial to characterize high-risk individuals and households for better targeting of regional elimination efforts. Here we analyzed 5,480 records of laboratory-confirmed clinical malaria episodes combined with demographic and socioeconomic information to identify risk factors for elevated malaria incidence in Mâncio Lima, the main urban transmission hotspot of Brazil. Overdispersed malaria count data clustered into households were fitted with random-effects zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. Random-effect predictors were used to characterize the spatial heterogeneity in malaria risk at the household level. Adult males were identified as the population stratum at greatest risk, likely due to increased occupational exposure away of the town. However, poor housing and residence in the less urbanized periphery of the town were also found to be key predictors of malaria risk, consistent with a substantial local transmission. Two thirds of the 8,878 urban residents remained uninfected after 23,975 person-years of follow-up. Importantly, we estimated that nearly 14% of them, mostly children and older adults living in the central urban hub, were free of malaria risk, being either unexposed, naturally unsusceptible, or immune to infection. We conclude that statistical modeling of routinely collected, but often neglected, malaria surveillance data can be explored to characterize drivers of transmission heterogeneity at the community level and provide evidence for the rational deployment of control interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2968546737,"Diet has been shown to influence epigenetic key players, such as DNA methylation, which can regulate the gene expression potential in both parents and offspring. Diets enriched in omega-6 and deficient in omega-3 PUFAs (low dietary omega-3/omega-6 PUFA ratio), have been associated with the promotion of pathogenesis of diseases in humans and other mammals. In this study, we investigated the impact of increased dietary intake of arachidonic acid (ARA), a physiologically important omega-6 PUFA, on 2 generations of zebrafish. Parental fish were fed either a low or a high ARA diet, while the progeny of both groups were fed the low ARA diet. We screened for DNA methylation on single base-pair resolution using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The DNA methylation profiling revealed significant differences between the dietary groups in both parents and offspring. The majority of differentially methylated loci associated with high dietary ARA were found in introns and intergenic regions for both generations. Common loci between the identified differentially methylated loci in F0 and F1 livers were reported. We described overlapping gene annotations of identified methylation changes with differential expression, but based on a small number of overlaps. The present study describes the diet-associated methylation profiles across genomic regions, and it demonstrates that parental high dietary ARA modulates DNA methylation patterns in zebrafish liver."

Because Klotho and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) are associated with ageing process and endothelial dysfunction, it is possible that Klotho has an association with cerebral SVD. We aimed to investigate the association of plasma Klotho concentration with the presence, burden and progression of cerebral SVD. We prospectively enrolled 262 patients with first-ever acute cerebral infarction, performed brain MRI and collected their blood samples within 24 hours of admission. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for evaluating plasma Klotho concentration. We estimated the total SVD score of each patient after determining the presence and burden of high-grade white matter hyperintensities (HWMHs), cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), high-grade perivascular spaces (HPVSs) and asymptomatic lacunar infarctions (ALIs). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to investigate association of Klotho with cerebral SVD and the total SVD score. Of the 262 patients, 152 (58.0%) were men. The mean age of these patients was 64.7 years. The mean ± standard deviation of plasma Klotho concentration was 329.8 ± 194.1 pg/mL. In multivariate analysis, plasma Klotho concentration was negatively associated with the presence of HWMHs [Odds ratio (OR): 0.13, p = 0.047], HPVSs (OR: 0.22, p = 0.024) and ALIs (OR: 0.53, p = 0.021) but not associated with the presence of CMBs (OR: 0.39, p = 0.404). Plasma Klotho concentration was also negatively related to the total SVD score (unstandardized coefficients beta: −0.895, standard error = 0.317, p = 0.005, R2 = 0.239). Furthermore, plasma Klotho concentration was negatively related to the presence (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59–0.96, p = 0.025) and severity of cerebral SVD progression (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56–0.92, p = 0.009).

This study aimed to investigate the spatial distributions of notified TB over the whole territory of Ethiopia and to quantify the role of health care access, environmental, socio-demographic, and behavioural factors associated with the clustering of TB.A spatial analysis was conducted using national TB data reported between June 2016 and June 2017 in Ethiopia. Spatial clustering of TB was explored using Moran's I statistic and the local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA). A multivariate Poisson regression model was developed with a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior structure and with posterior parameters estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation with Gibbs sampling to investigate the drivers of the clustering.A total of 120,149 TB cases were reported from 745 districts in Ethiopia during the study period; 41,343 (34%) were bacteriologically confirmed new pulmonary TB and 33,997 (28%) were clinically diagnosed, new, smear-negative pulmonary TB patients. The nationwide annual incidence rate of notified TB was 112 per 100,000 population. The highest incidence was observed in three city administrative regions, namely Dire Dewa (348 cases per 100,000 population), Addis Ababa (262 per 100,000 population) and Harari (206 per 100,000 population), and the lowest incidence was observed in Somali region (51 per 100,000 population). High-high spatial clustering of notified TB was detected at Humera, Gog, and Surima district, and low-low clustering was detected in some districts located in the Somali region. Poor health care access (IRR = 0.78; 95%CI: 0.66, 0.90) and good knowledge about TB (IRR = 0.84; 95%CI: 0.73, 0.96) were negatively associated with the incidence of notified TB.Substantial spatial clustering of notified TB was detected at region, zone and district level in Ethiopia. Health care access and knowledge about TB was associated with incidence of TB. This study may provide policy makers target hotspot areas, where national control programs could be implemented more efficiently for the prevention and control of TB, and to address potential under-reporting in poor access areas."
https://openalex.org/W2968345006,"Adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has led to clinical benefit in some patients with melanoma but has not demonstrated convincing efficacy in other solid cancers. Whilst the presence of TILs in many types of cancer is often associated with better clinical prognosis, their function has not been systematically evaluated across cancer types. Responses to immunological checkpoint inhibitors in a wide range of cancers, including those for which adoptive transfer of expanded TILs has not shown clinical benefit, has clearly delineated a number of tumor type associated with tumor-reactive lymphocytes capable of effecting tumor remissions. Neuroblastoma is an aggressive childhood solid cancer in which immunotherapy with GD2-directed antibodies confers a proven survival advantage through incompletely understood mechanisms. We therefore evaluated the feasibility of ex vivo expansion of TILs from freshly resected neuroblastoma tumors and the potential therapeutic utility of TIL expansions. TILs were successfully expanded from both tumor biopsies or resections. Significant numbers of NKT and γδT cells were identified alongside the mixed population of cytotoxic (CD8+) and helper (CD4+) T cells of both effector and central memory phenotypes. Isolated TILs were broadly non-reactive against autologous tumor and neuroblastoma cell lines, so enhancement of neuroblastoma killing was attained by transducing TILs with a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting GD2. CAR-TILs demonstrated antigen-specific cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines. This study is the first to show reproducible expansion of TILs from pediatric neuroblastoma, the high proportion of innate-like lymphocytes, and the feasibility to use CAR-TILs therapeutically."
https://openalex.org/W2968925800,"Empirical research has provided mixed evidence regarding the question of whether higher social class promotes prosocial behavior. Recently, Côté et al. [1] hypothesized that these conflicting evidences might result from a hitherto neglected interaction between the individual’s level of income and the degree of inequality in one’s society. They argue that societies with a higher level of inequality foster a sense of entitlement in high-income individuals, which in turn leads them to be less generous. We put this reasoning to a large-scale test using observational data from the European Social Survey (ESS) and push the scope of our investigation towards a broader conception of social class, using next to income two additional measures of class. First, we examine whether high-class individuals in societies with high levels of inequality do in fact feel more entitled than their counterparts in more equal societies. While we find that an individual’s class and the disposition towards entitlement are strongly correlated, our results show a negative interaction with inequality, i.e. the effect of class on the personal sense of entitlement is weaker in societies with high levels of inequality. Second, we test whether the effect of class on prosocial behavior is moderated by economic inequality with respect to two real-life acts of prosocial behavior, namely engaging in volunteer work and donating money to a humanitarian organization. Our results indicate a substantial positive effect of class on prosocial behavior throughout, as well as a moderate, yet positive, interaction effect of class and inequality."

The analysis encompassed individuals of both sexes and all ages, across a range of geographic, environmental and seasonal conditions that the species experiences in Portugal allowing us to account for spatial, temporal and biological factors that contribute to hair cortisol variation. Our results showed that age, sex and storage time had an effect on hair cortisol, but season did not. Hair cortisol was higher in early stage juveniles compared to other age cohorts, in males when compared to females, and decreased with longer storage time. By identifying the factors that influence baseline hair cortisol in this wild population, we establish the basis for its application as an indicator of the effect of natural and anthropogenic stressors."

Materials and methods Both MB excitation and blipped-CAIPI with in-plane parallel imaging were incorporated into a gradient-echo (GE)/spin-echo (SE) EPI sequence for simultaneous tracking of the dynamic MR signal changes in both GE and SE contrasts after the injection of contrast agent. MB and singleband (SB) excitation were compared using a 20-channel head coil at 3 Tesla, and high-resolution MB VAI could be performed in 32 glioma patients. Results Whole-brain covered high resolution VAI can be achieved after applying multiband excitation with a factor of 2 and in-plane parallel imaging with a factor of 3. The quality of the images resulting from MB acceleration was comparable to those from the SB method: images were reconstructed without any loss of spatial resolution or severe distortions. In addition, MB and SB signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) were similar. A relative low g-factor induced from the MB acceleration method was achieved after using a blipped-CAIPI technique (1.35 for GE and 1.33 for SE imaging). Performing quantitative VAI, we found that, among all VAI parametric maps, microvessel type indicator (MTI), distance map (I) and vascular-induced bolus peak-time shift (VIPS) were highly correlated. Likewise, VAI parametric maps of slope, slope length and short axis were highly correlated. Conclusions Multiband accelerated SAGE successfully doubles the number of readout slices in the same measurement time when compared to conventional readout sequences. The corresponding VAI parametric maps provide insights into the complexity and heterogeneity of vascular changes in glioma."

The associations between HRV measurements were analyzed through principal component analysis and k-means clustering. The effects of the time lengths on HRV measurements and post-menstrual age (PMA) were analyzed by linear mixed effect model for repeated measures.The domains of analysis were concordant for their descriptive parameters of short (rMSSD, SD1 and HF) and long-term (SD, SD2 and LF) variability. α1 was correlated with the LF/HF and SD2/SD1. DC and AC were correlated with short-term variability estimates and significantly increased with GA and PMA. Shortening the windows of analysis increased the random measurement error for all the features and increased the bias for all but short term features and HVGs.The linear and non-linear measurements of HRV are correlated each other. Shortening the windows of analysis increased the random error for all the features and increased the bias for all but short term features and HVGs.

In modern day psychology, these interactions can be examined within the frameworks of visual perspective taking and body ownership. Both target similar questions: What does it take, to become one with the avatar? When do we show the same behavior and make the same experiences, as if we were in its place? In this study, we want to address the role of action effect consistency for these concepts. We manipulated the participants' sense of agency over a task-irrelevant avatar in a Simon task by providing either corresponding or random action effects. These effects could be either embodied and therefore linked to the avatar (Experiment 1) or independent of it (Experiment 2). We used stimulus-response compatibility effects from the avatar's point of view as a measure for spontaneous visual perspective taking and a questionnaire to measure the perceived body ownership of the avatar. The results showed that corresponding action effects lead to increased spontaneous perspective taking of the avatar, regardless of whether the effect was linked to the avatar or not. Though the avatar compatibility effects were overall more pronounced in the embodied action effect condition. However, significant differences in perceived body ownership were only observed if the effects were linked to the avatar. The results might prove useful to further our understanding of subjective and objective measurements of interactions with avatars."

Inadequate and inequitable access to essential NCD medicines is a major concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. National Essential Medicines Lists (EMLs) are important policy tools that indicate which medicines are prioritized as essential within a country's health system. This study sought to analyze a wide range of national essential medicines lists (EMLs) for their inclusion of priority non communicable disease (NCD) interventions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).Three lists of WHO endorsed priority NCD interventions were included. A database with 137 national EMLs and the WHO EML was created from the WHO Repository and these EMLs were compared for listing of priority NCD interventions.Across 137 countries with national EMLs, the median percentage of 20 Best Buys interventions listed was 90% (IQR 80-95) and 31 Package of essential noncommunicable disease interventions (PEN) interventions listed was 94% (IQR 90-97), of 9 HEARTS interventions was 100% (IQR 89-100), and of the 43 unique interventions across the three priority lists was 88% (IQR 84-93). Less than 80% of the 43 interventions were listed by 22 (16%) countries and less than half of the interventions were listed by 2 countries: Angola (35%) and Cambodia (23%). Interventions listed on the fewest number of national EMLs were: influenza vaccine, HPV vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, cervical cancer chemotherapy, codeine, promethazine, senna, and oxygen.Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases. The majority of priority medicines for NCDs described within key WHO NCD technical packages are listed on nearly all national EMLs across 137 countries of all income levels. Most NCD interventions have been prioritized in national policy in most cases, but in some countries and for select interventions such as the HPV vaccine, prioritization may be reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W2968097188,"Nowadays CHK2 mutation is studied frequently in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer patients in addition to BRCA1/BRCA2. CHK2 is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase, also involved in pathways such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. CHK2 is a well-studied moderate penetrance gene that correlates with third high risk susceptibility gene with an increased risk for breast cancer. Hence before planning large population study, it is better to scrutinize putative functional SNPs of CHK2 using different computational tools. In this study, we have used various computational approaches to identify nsSNPs which are deleterious to the structure and/or function of CHK2 protein that might be causing this disease. Computational analysis was performed by different in silico tools including SIFT, Align GVGD, SNAP-2, PROVEAN, Poly-Phen-2, PANTHER, PhD-SNP, MUpro, iPTREE-STAB, Consurf, InterPro, NCBI Conserved Domain Search tool, ModPred, SPARKS-X, RAMPAGE, Verify-3D, FT Site, COACH and PyMol. Out of 78 nsSNP of human CHK2 gene, seven nsSNPs were predicted functionally most significant SNPs. Among these seven nsSNP, p.Arg160Gly, p.Gly210Arg and p.Ser415Phe are highly conserved residues with conservation score of 9 and three nsSNP were predicted to be involved in post translational modification. The p.Arg160Gly and p.Gly210Arg may interfere in phosphopeptide binding site on FHA conserved domain. The p.Ser415Phe may interfere in formation of activation loop of protein-kinase domain and might interfere in interactions of CHK2 with ligand. The study concludes that mutation of serine to phenylalanine at position 415 is a major mutation in native CHK2 protein which might contribute to its malfunction, ultimately causing disease. This is the first comprehensive study, where CHK2 gene variants are analyzed using in silico tools hence it will be of great help while considering large scale studies and also in developing precision medicines related to these polymorphisms in the era of personalized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2967810186,"Perceived as a minor transportation mode mainly for recreation, cycling and its related safety issues have not been treated as a citywide concern in Hong Kong and have thus received inadequate research efforts. Our study aimed to illuminate the safety challenges faced by cyclists in Hong Kong.We examined the police crash records from 1998 to 2017 and developed a Bayesian Poisson state space model to evaluate the longitudinal change in traffic injuries to cyclists. We then used quasi-induced exposure to measure the annual relative risk of crash involvement for cycling. Based on an officially published travel characteristics survey, we further measured the risk of injury for cycling per minutes cycled.Between 1998 and 2017, Hong Kong witnessed a more than twofold increase in the number of cyclist injuries, with an average annual increase rate of 5.18% (95% CI: 0.53%-12.77%). By 2017, cyclists were 2.21 (1.82-2.69) times more likely to be involved in traffic crashes than in 1998. Per 10 million minutes, the injury rates for cycling were 28.64 (27.43-29.70) and 42.54 (41.07-44.02) on weekdays during 2001-2003 and 2010-2012. After adjusting for sex and age groups, cyclists were 1.95 (1.43-2.61) times more likely to be injured in 2010-2012 than in 2001-2003. Per minutes traveled, cyclists also sustained significantly higher risks of fatality and injury than pedestrians, private car drivers and passengers, taxi passengers, public bus passengers, and minibus passengers. A comparison of Hong Kong with other regions suggests that Hong Kong is among the most dangerous areas for cycling in terms of fatality rate per minutes cycled.Cyclist injuries have become a substantial public health burden in Hong Kong. A range of countermeasures with proven effectiveness should be promptly implemented to improve the safety of these vulnerable road users."
https://openalex.org/W2968263924,"We investigated the incidences and characteristics of pediatric traumatic injuries requiring emergency department visits, through a complementary approach using both nationwide-sample and single-institutional data. Data for children (aged <15 years) identified with traumatic injuries during a 10-year period from the Korean National Health Insurance Sharing Service (n = 35,064 among 10,114,909 randomly sampled cases from the claim records of the National Health Insurance) and the authors' institute (n = 39,228) were retrospectively reviewed. The incidences and characteristics of the injuries were investigated using both datasets; additionally, detailed information regarding the injury environments was investigated using the single-institutional data. The findings were similar across both datasets. The incidence of injuries increased during the study period; the head was most commonly injured, whereas the trunk or proximal extremities were rarely injured; low-energy head injuries accounted for >50% of the cases in children aged <5 years, although the incidences of lower-extremity injuries and fractures increased in older children. Single-institutional data demonstrated that the proportion of indoor playground and trampoline-related injuries increased rapidly during the study period, and outdoor injuries and seasonal variation (with peak incidences in May and June) were more prominent in older children. Based on similarities between both datasets, the detailed results regarding pediatric traumatic injuries obtained from the single-institutional data could be generalized nationally with adequate external validity. To prevent traumatic injuries, it may be more effective to wear protective equipment covering the head and distal extremities rather than the trunk or proximal extremities; simple clothing, such as caps, could prevent many injuries in preschoolers. Among older children, safety guidelines for outdoor sports/leisure activities are needed. The increase in pediatric traumatic injuries may be partially explained by the increased availability of indoor playgrounds and installation of trampolines. Stricter adherence to the preventive guidelines is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2968332922,"Background Uncontrolled high blood pressure (UBP) can lead to various cardiovascular complications causing an estimated nine million deaths per year worldwide. In Meknes, epidemiologic data on UBP are scarce, depriving programs from evidence-based information that would allow a better management of hypertension. Hence, we aimed to assess UBP prevalence in hypertensive patients treated in Meknes and identify UBP-associated risk factors. Methods Between November and December 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional study enrolling 922 hypertensive patients managed at Meknes’s primary health care facilities using the multistage sampling method. We interviewed patients face to face to collect their socio-demographic-characteristics, lifestyle behaviours, clinical parameters and the triad care system-patient-physician. Another questionnaire was self-administered by physicians to characterize therapeutic inertia. A multivariate logistic regression analysis highlighted the risk factors associated with UBP. Results UBP prevalence was 73% with a mean age of 61±11 years (mean±standard deviation) and a male/female ratio of 1/3. Risk factors associated with UBP were: therapeutic inertia (adjusted odds ratio to other variables (AOR) = 18.2, 95% CI [8.35–39.84]), drug non-adherence (AOR = 1.8, 95% CI [1.07–3.04]), obesity/overweight (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI [1.03–2.58]), unemployment (AOR = 1.9, 95% CI [1.09–3.01]), low income (AOR = 2.6, 95% CI [1.01–6.86]), family history of hypertension (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI [1.07–2.08]) and male sex (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI [1.04–2.58]). Conclusion UBP prevalence is high in Meknes. Prevention should firstly focus on raised awareness of hypertensive patients’ self-care management. Secondly, health professionals should better comply to the guidelines of anti-hypertensive treatments. Lastly, health professionals should frequently be reminded to reach therapeutic goals to overcome therapeutic inertia."
https://openalex.org/W2969175566,"The bacterial strain WD-2, which was capable of efficiently degrading prochloraz-manganese, was isolated from soil contaminated with prochloraz-manganese, selected through enrichment culturing and identified as Bacillus cereus. Test results indicated that the optimal temperature and pH for bacterial growth were 35-40°C and 7.0-8.0, respectively. The highest degradation rate was above 88-90% when the pH was 7.0~8.0 and reached a maximum value (90.7%) at approximately 8.0. In addition, the bacterium showed the greatest growth ability with an OD600 of 0.805 and the highest degradation rate (68.2%) when glucose was chosen as the carbon source, while the difference in nitrogen source had no obvious influence on bacterial growth. The degradation rate exceeded 80% when the NaCl concentration was 0~2% and the rate reached 89.2% at 1%. When the concentration was higher than 7%, the growth of WD-2 and the degradation of prochloraz-manganese were found to be inhibited, and the degradation rate was merely 8.5%. The results indicated that strain WD-2 was able to effectively degrade prochloraz-manganese and might contribute to the bioremediation of contaminated soils."
https://openalex.org/W2968980316,"Numerous factors affect reaction times to vibrotactile cues. Therefore, it is important to consider the relative magnitudes of these time delays when designing vibrotactile displays for real-time applications. The objectives of this study were to quantify reaction times to typical vibrotactile stimuli parameters through direct comparison within a single experimental setting, and to determine the relative importance of these factors on reaction times. Young (n = 10, 21.9 ± 1.3 yrs) and older adults (n = 13, 69.4 ± 5.0 yrs) performed simple reaction time tasks by responding to vibrotactile stimuli using a thumb trigger while frequency, location, auditory cues, number of tactors in the same location, and tactor type were varied. Participants also performed a secondary task in a subset of the trials. The factors investigated in this study affected reaction times by 20–300 ms (reaction time findings are noted in parentheses) depending on the specific stimuli condition. In general, auditory cues generated by the tactors (<20 ms), vibration frequency (<20 ms), number of tactors in the same location (<30 ms) and tactor type (<50 ms) had relatively small effects on reaction times, while stimulus location (20–120 ms) and secondary cognitive task (>130 ms) had relatively large effects. Factors affected young and older adults’ reaction times in a similar manner, but with different magnitudes. These findings can inform the development of vibrotactile displays by enabling designers to directly compare the relative effects of key factors on reaction times."
https://openalex.org/W2967716759,"Determining the distribution of the Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis, YFP) in the Yangtze River has to date relied on traditional visual and counting methods, but such field surveys are time-consuming and expensive. Analyses using environmental DNA (eDNA) to investigate the presence and range of endangered aquatic species have proven to be more economical and effective detection methods, and are a non-invasive approach to sampling. A challenge of relying on eDNA for YFP monitoring is that the Yangtze River is characterized by high turbidity and a strong current. Here, we used an eDNA-based approach to estimate the presence of YFP at 18 sites in the Yangtze River in August 2017 and at an additional 11 sites in January 2018. At each sampling site, we filtered six 1 L water samples with 5 µm pore size filter paper and quantified the amount of YFP eDNA in each water sample using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In addition, YFP eDNA was successfully detected in locations where we visually observed YFP, as well as in locations where YFP were not observed directly. We found that our eDNA-based method had higher detection rates than traditional field survey methods. Although YFP was visually observed in the Yangtze River in winter, water samples collected during the summer contained significantly higher YFP eDNA than winter water samples. Our results demonstrate the potential effectiveness of eDNA detection methods in determining the distribution of YFP in the Yangtze River."
https://openalex.org/W2967623545,"The two main collagen receptors on platelets, GPVI and integrin α2β1, play an important role for the recognition of exposed collagen at sites of vessel injury, which leads to platelet activation and subsequently stable thrombus formation. Both receptors are already expressed on megakaryocytes, the platelet forming cells within the bone marrow. Megakaryocytes are in permanent contact with collagen filaments in the marrow cavity and at the basal lamina of sinusoids without obvious preactivation. The role of both collagen receptors for megakaryocyte maturation and thrombopoiesis is still poorly understood. To investigate the function of both collagen receptors, we generated mice that are double deficient for Gp6 and Itga2. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that the deficiency of both receptors had no impact on platelet number and led to the expected lack in GPVI responsiveness. Integrin activation and degranulation ability was comparable to wildtype mice. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we could demonstrate that both wildtype and double-deficient megakaryocytes were overall normally distributed within the bone marrow. We found megakaryocyte count and size to be normal, the localization within the bone marrow, the degree of maturation, as well as their association to sinusoids were also unaltered. However, the contact of megakaryocytes to collagen type I filaments was decreased at sinusoids compared to wildtype mice, while the interaction to type IV collagen was unaffected. Our results imply that GPVI and α2β1 have no influence on the localization of megakaryocytes within the bone marrow, their association to the sinusoids or their maturation. The decreased contact of megakaryocytes to collagen type I might at least partially explain the unaltered platelet phenotype in these mice, since proplatelet formation is mediated by these receptors and their interaction to collagen. It is rather likely that other compensatory signaling pathways and receptors play a role that needs to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W2967981711,"Background and objective Health status in childhood is correlated with educational outcomes. Emergency hospital admissions during childhood are common but it is not known how these unplanned breaks from schooling impact on education outcomes. We hypothesised that children who had emergency hospital admissions had an increased risk of lower educational attainment, in addition to the increased risks associated with other health, social and school factors. Methods This record-linked electronic birth cohort, included children born in Wales between 1 January 1998 and 31 August 2001. We fitted multilevel logistic regression models grouped by schools, to determine whether emergency hospital inpatient admission before age 7 years was associated with the educational outcome of not attaining the expected level in a teacher-based assessment at age 7 years (KS1). We adjusted for pregnancy, perinatal, socio-economic, neighbourhood, pupil mobility and school-level factors. Results The cohort comprised 64 934 children. Overall, 4680 (7.2%) did not attain the expected educational level. Emergency admission to hospital was associated with poor educational attainment (OR 1.12 95% Credible Interval (CI) 1.05, 1.20 for all causes during childhood, OR 1.19 95%CI 1.07, 1.32 for injuries and external causes and OR 1.31 95%CI 1.04, 1.22 for admissions during infancy), after adjusting for known determinants of education outcomes such as extreme prematurity, being small for gestational age and socio-economic indicators, such as eligibility for free school meals. Conclusion Emergency inpatient hospital admission during childhood, particularly during infancy or for injuries and external causes was associated with an increased risk of lower education attainment at age 7 years, in addition to the effects of pregnancy factors (gestational age, birthweight) and social deprivation. These findings support the need for injury prevention measures and additional support in school for affected children to help them to achieve their potential."
https://openalex.org/W2967879954,"Obesity and lack of physical exercise are associated with the increase of diabetes mellitus in women of reproductive age and during the gestational period. The objective of the present study was to evaluate physical activity levels during the pregnancy and postpartum periods and the influence of body mass index (BMI) in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or low risk pregnancy. The Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ), translated and validated for Portuguese, was used for the evaluation of physical activity (PA) level. The sample was stratified according to preconception BMI and the presence or absence of diagnosis of GDM, resulting in four groups with 66 participants each: low risk pregnancy (LRP) with normal weight (BMI ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 24 kg/m2), LRP and overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2), GDM with normal weight and GDM with overweight/obese. The level of PA of each participant was measured as Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) during the preconceptional period (T0), in the third trimester of gestation (T1), and three months after delivery (T2). The comparison of the MET values showed that the values found in the evaluation three months after delivery (T2) were higher than 1.00 (1.10 MET for the LRP-normal weight, 1.06 MET for LRP-overweight/obese, 1.02 MET for the GDM- normal weight, 1.07 MET for the GDM-overweight/obese). On the pre-gestational (T0) and third trimester (T1) analyzes, the values were less than 1.00 MET. The analysis between groups in relation to BMI and diagnosis of GDM showed no difference."
https://openalex.org/W2968092998,"Therapeutic hypothermia initiated during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in pre-clinical studies appears to be highly protective against sudden cardiac arrest injury. Given the challenges to implementing CPR cooling clinically, insights into its critical mechanisms of protection could guide development of new CPR drugs that mimic hypothermia effects without the need for physical cooling. Here, we used Akt1-deficient mice that lose CPR hypothermia protection to identify hypothermia targets. Adult female C57BL/6 mice (Akt1+/+ and Akt1+/-) underwent 8 min of KCl-induced asystolic arrest and were randomized to receive hypothermia (30 ± 0.5°C) or normothermia. Hypothermia was initiated during CPR and extended for 1 h after resuscitation. Neurologically scored survival was measured at 72 h. Other outcomes included mean arterial pressure and target measures in heart and brain related to contractile function, glucose utilization and inflammation. Compared to northothermia, hypothermia improved both 2h mean arterial pressure and 72h neurologically intact survival in Akt1+/+ mice but not in Akt1+/- mice. In Akt1+/+ mice, hypothermia increased Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation, pyruvate dehydrogenase activation, and NAD+ and ATP production while decreasing IκBα degradation and NF-κB activity in both heart and brain at 30 min after CPR. It also increased phospholamban phosphorylation in heart tissue. Further, hypothermia reduced metabolic and inflammatory blood markers lactate and Pre-B cell Colony Enhancing Factor. Despite hypothermia treatment, all these effects were reversed in Akt1+/- mice. Taken together, drugs that target Akt1 and its effectors may have the potential to mimic hypothermia-like protection to improve sudden cardiac arrest survival when administered during CPR."
https://openalex.org/W2967806786,"The onset of self-organized motion is studied in a poroelastic two-phase model with free boundaries for Physarum microplasmodia (MP). In the model, an active gel phase is assumed to be interpenetrated by a passive fluid phase on small length scales. A feedback loop between calcium kinetics, mechanical deformations, and induced fluid flow gives rise to pattern formation and the establishment of an axis of polarity. Altogether, we find that the calcium kinetics that breaks the conservation of the total calcium concentration in the model and a nonlinear friction between MP and substrate are both necessary ingredients to obtain an oscillatory movement with net motion of the MP. By numerical simulations in one spatial dimension, we find two different types of oscillations with net motion as well as modes with time-periodic or irregular switching of the axis of polarity. The more frequent type of net motion is characterized by mechano-chemical waves traveling from the front towards the rear. The second type is characterized by mechano-chemical waves that appear alternating from the front and the back. While both types exhibit oscillatory forward and backward movement with net motion in each cycle, the trajectory and gel flow pattern of the second type are also similar to recent experimental measurements of peristaltic MP motion. We found moving MPs in extended regions of experimentally accessible parameters, such as length, period and substrate friction strength. Simulations of the model show that the net speed increases with the length, provided that MPs are longer than a critical length of ≈ 120 μm. Both predictions are in line with recent experimental observations."
https://openalex.org/W2967177578,"Introduction While there are no national clinical guidelines for managing primary insomnia in Saudi Arabia, there are also no published studies of physicians’ perceptions of and attitudes towards using international guidelines. The objective of this study was to explore the knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes of physicians practising in Saudi Arabia about using international guidelines for managing insomnia. Methods A qualitative study using in-depth, face-to-face, and semi-structured interviews with 15 physicians held in July 2017 at a tertiary care hospital in Jazan, the distal south-western province in Saudi Arabia. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded using the qualitative software NVivo11 and analysed thematically. Data saturation was assumed as no new understandings of the broad thematic issues were produced by the last three interviews. Results Themes identified were: Knowledge, Resistance, Barriers and Facilitators. Participants acknowledged their lack of awareness of available guidelines and their lack of training and education about Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). They highlighted a lack of education for patients about insomnia and its treatment. Beliefs about dependence on hypnotics and the inappropriateness of international guidelines for Saudi Arabia inclined many to resist using them. Inability to document diagnosis and consultations due to limited time and lack of suitable electronic systems, lack of suitably trained practitioners for referral for CBT-I, and lack of accountability for practice were identified as key barriers to following international guidelines. Development of national guidelines was the most important facilitator suggested by participants. Conclusions The health authorities in the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) should improve general public awareness about sleep disorders and provide focused training for specialists and technologists. Above all, KSA needs its own nationwide guidelines for treating sleep-disorders based on evidence-based clinical trials, consistent with its history, culture, socioeconomic conditions and traditions."

We used our own and citizen science-generated reproductive data acquired through The Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s NestWatch Program, combined with drought and vegetation indices obtained from governmental agencies, to determine drought effects on Eastern Bluebird (Sialia sialis L.) reproduction across their North American breeding range for the years 2006–2013. Our results demonstrate that some aspects of bluebird reproductive success vary with the timing and severity of drought. Clutch size was unaffected by any level of drought at the time of clutch initiation or during the 30 to 60 days prior to clutch initiation. Hatching and fledging rates decreased as drought severity increased. Drought conditions occurring at least 30 days prior to the date eggs should have hatched and 60 days prior to the date offspring should have fledged negatively affected reproduction. We also demonstrate the value of datasets generated by citizen scientists in combination with climate data for examining biotic responses at large temporal and spatial scales."

https://openalex.org/W2967132079,"The heterogeneous nucleation of ice processes involving loess particles that influences the formation of mixed-phase clouds are poorly understood. Here, the ice nucleating ability of wind-blown dust or loess accumulated from the past glaciated area was investigated at three temperatures: -26, -30, and -34 °C and at below and above saturation with respect to liquid water conditions. Total six loess samples from different regions across Columbia Basin province, WA, USA were collected, dry dispersed, size-selected at mobility diameter 200 nm, and investigated for their ice nucleation efficiency. To understand the effect of atmospheric processing during long-range transport on their ice nucleating ability, similar experiments were also performed on acid-treated loess samples. Additionally, the ice nucleating properties of Arizona Test Dust (ATD) were investigated as a surrogate for natural mineral dust particles to test the experimental approach. Results show that treated particles have lower ice nucleation efficiency compared to untreated particles at all temperature and saturation with respect to liquid water conditions. Comparison based on ice-active site density (Ns) metric indicate that loess particles at saturation with respect to liquid water conditions are marginally more efficient than the mineral and soil dust values reported in the literature, but they have lower efficiencies than the predicted Ns efficiency of K-feldspar particles at supercooled temperatures greater than -38 °C."

https://openalex.org/W2968447213,"There is increasing evidence showing that pleiotropy is a widespread phenomenon in complex diseases for which multiple correlated traits are often measured. Joint analysis of multiple traits could increase statistical power by aggregating multiple weak effects. Existing methods for multiple trait association tests usually study each of the multiple traits separately and then combine the univariate test statistics or combine p-values of the univariate tests for identifying disease associated genetic variants. However, ignoring correlation between phenotypes may cause power loss. Additionally, the genetic variants in one gene (including common and rare variants) are often viewed as a whole that affects the underlying disease since the basic functional unit of inheritance is a gene rather than a genetic variant. Thus, results from gene level association tests can be more readily integrated with downstream functional and pathogenic investigation, whereas many existing methods for multiple trait association tests only focus on testing a single common variant rather than a gene. In this article, we propose a statistical method by Testing an Optimally Weighted Combination of Multiple traits (TOW-CM) to test the association between multiple traits and multiple variants in a genomic region (a gene or pathway). We investigate the performance of the proposed method through extensive simulation studies. Our simulation studies show that the proposed method has correct type I error rates and is either the most powerful test or comparable with the most powerful tests. Additionally, we illustrate the usefulness of TOW-CM based on a COPDGene study."
