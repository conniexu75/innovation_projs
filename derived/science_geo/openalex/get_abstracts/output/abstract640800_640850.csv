https://openalex.org/W2979167769,"Atherosclerosis is driven by multifaceted contributions of the immune system within the circulation and at vascular focal sites. However, specific characteristics of dysregulated immune cells within atherosclerotic lesions that lead to clinical events such as ischemic stroke or myocardial infarction are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, we uncovered distinct features of both T cells and macrophages in carotid artery plaques of patients with clinically symptomatic disease (recent stroke or transient ischemic attack) compared to asymptomatic disease (no recent stroke). Plaques from symptomatic patients were characterized by a distinct subset of CD4+ T cells and by T cells that were activated and differentiated. Moreover, some T cell subsets in these plaques presented markers of T cell exhaustion. Additionally, macrophages from these plaques contained alternatively activated phenotypes, including subsets associated with plaque vulnerability. In plaques from asymptomatic patients, T cells and macrophages were activated and displayed evidence of interleukin-1β signaling. The identification of specific features of innate and adaptive immune cells in plaques that are associated with cerebrovascular events may enable the design of more precisely tailored cardiovascular immunotherapies."

https://openalex.org/W2978373708,"Rectal cancer (RC) is a challenging disease to treat that requires chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to optimize outcomes for individual patients. No accurate model of RC exists to answer fundamental research questions relevant to patients. We established a biorepository of 65 patient-derived RC organoid cultures (tumoroids) from patients with primary, metastatic or recurrent disease. RC tumoroids retained molecular features of the tumors from which they were derived, and their ex vivo responses to clinically relevant chemotherapy and radiation treatment correlated with the clinical responses noted in individual patients' tumors. Upon engraftment into murine rectal mucosa, human RC tumoroids gave rise to invasive RC followed by metastasis to lung and liver. Importantly, engrafted tumors displayed the heterogenous sensitivity to chemotherapy observed clinically. Thus, the biology and drug sensitivity of RC clinical isolates can be efficiently interrogated using an organoid-based, ex vivo platform coupled with in vivo endoluminal propagation in animals."
https://openalex.org/W2977871370,"We report the results of a first exploratory study testing the use of vaginal microbiome transplantation (VMT) from healthy donors as a therapeutic alternative for patients suffering from symptomatic, intractable and recurrent bacterial vaginosis (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02236429 ). In our case series, five patients were treated, and in four of them VMT was associated with full long-term remission until the end of follow-up at 5-21 months after VMT, defined as marked improvement of symptoms, Amsel criteria, microscopic vaginal fluid appearance and reconstitution of a Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiome. One patient presented with incomplete remission in clinical and laboratory features. No adverse effects were observed in any of the five women. Notably, remission in three patients necessitated repeated VMT, including a donor change in one patient, to elicit a long-standing clinical response. The therapeutic efficacy of VMT in women with intractable and recurrent bacterial vaginosis should be further determined in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2978231265,"The increasing availability of large healthcare databases is fueling an intense debate on whether real-world data should play a role in the assessment of the benefit–risk of medical treatments. In many observational studies, for example, statin users were found to have a substantially lower risk of cancer than in meta-analyses of randomized trials. Although such discrepancies are often attributed to a lack of randomization in the observational studies, they might be explained by flaws that can be avoided by explicitly emulating a target trial (the randomized trial that would answer the question of interest). Using the electronic health records of 733,804 UK adults, we emulated a target trial of statins and cancer and compared our estimates with those obtained using previously applied analytic approaches. Over the 10-yr follow-up, 28,408 individuals developed cancer. Under the target trial approach, estimated observational analogs of intention-to-treat and per-protocol 10-yr cancer-free survival differences were −0.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) −1.0%, 0.0%) and −0.3% (95% CI −1.5%, 0.5%), respectively. By contrast, previous analytic approaches yielded estimates that appeared to be strongly protective. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly emulating a target trial to reduce bias in the effect estimates derived from observational analyses. Explicitly emulating a target trial using real-world data can avoid common biases in observational studies."

https://openalex.org/W2977826804,"Insulin and other injectable biologic drugs have transformed the treatment of patients suffering from diabetes1,2, yet patients and healthcare providers often prefer to use and prescribe less effective orally dosed medications3-5. Compared with subcutaneously administered drugs, oral formulations create less patient discomfort4, show greater chemical stability at high temperatures6, and do not generate biohazardous needle waste7. An oral dosage form for biologic medications is ideal; however, macromolecule drugs are not readily absorbed into the bloodstream through the gastrointestinal tract8. We developed an ingestible capsule, termed the luminal unfolding microneedle injector, which allows for the oral delivery of biologic drugs by rapidly propelling dissolvable drug-loaded microneedles into intestinal tissue using a set of unfolding arms. During ex vivo human and in vivo swine studies, the device consistently delivered the microneedles to the tissue without causing complete thickness perforations. Using insulin as a model drug, we showed that, when actuated, the luminal unfolding microneedle injector provided a faster pharmacokinetic uptake profile and a systemic uptake >10% of that of a subcutaneous injection over a 4-h sampling period. With the ability to load a multitude of microneedle formulations, the device can serve as a platform to orally deliver therapeutic doses of macromolecule drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2978203211,"Somatic mutations together with immunoediting drive extensive heterogeneity within non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein we examine heterogeneity of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) repertoire. The number of TCR sequences selectively expanded in tumors varies within and between tumors and correlates with the number of nonsynonymous mutations. Expanded TCRs can be subdivided into TCRs found in all tumor regions (ubiquitous) and those present in a subset of regions (regional). The number of ubiquitous and regional TCRs correlates with the number of ubiquitous and regional nonsynonymous mutations, respectively. Expanded TCRs form part of clusters of TCRs of similar sequence, suggestive of a spatially constrained antigen-driven process. CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes harboring ubiquitous TCRs display a dysfunctional tissue-resident phenotype. Ubiquitous TCRs are preferentially detected in the blood at the time of tumor resection as compared to routine follow-up. These findings highlight a noninvasive method to identify and track relevant tumor-reactive TCRs for use in adoptive T cell immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2978258146,"Approximately 50% of patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who undergo surgery with curative intent will relapse within 5 years1,2. Detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) at the time of surgery may represent a tool to identify patients at higher risk of recurrence for whom more frequent monitoring is advised. Here we asked whether CellSearch-detected pulmonary venous CTCs (PV-CTCs) at surgical resection of early-stage NSCLC represent subclones responsible for subsequent disease relapse. PV-CTCs were detected in 48% of 100 patients enrolled into the TRACERx study3, were associated with lung-cancer-specific relapse and remained an independent predictor of relapse in multivariate analysis adjusted for tumor stage. In a case study, genomic profiling of single PV-CTCs collected at surgery revealed higher mutation overlap with metastasis detected 10 months later (91%) than with the primary tumor (79%), suggesting that early-disseminating PV-CTCs were responsible for disease relapse. Together, PV-CTC enumeration and genomic profiling highlight the potential of PV-CTCs as early predictors of NSCLC recurrence after surgery. However, the limited sensitivity of PV-CTCs in predicting relapse suggests that further studies using a larger, independent cohort are warranted to confirm and better define the potential clinical utility of PV-CTCs in early-stage NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2977548937,"Therapies to reduce liver fibrosis and stimulate organ regeneration are urgently needed. We conducted a first-in-human, phase 1 dose-escalation trial of autologous macrophage therapy in nine adults with cirrhosis and a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 10–16 (ISRCTN 10368050). Groups of three participants received a single peripheral infusion of 107, 108 or up to 109 cells. Leukapheresis and macrophage infusion were well tolerated with no transfusion reactions, dose-limiting toxicities or macrophage activation syndrome. All participants were alive and transplant-free at one year, with only one clinical event recorded, the occurrence of minimal ascites. The primary outcomes of safety and feasibility were met. This study informs and provides a rationale for efficacy studies in cirrhosis and other fibrotic diseases. A first-in-human, phase 1 dose-escalation trial demonstrates the safety and feasibility of autologous macrophage therapy in adults with liver cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W2978862345,"Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus–Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV-ZEBOV) is the most advanced Ebola virus vaccine candidate and is currently being used to combat the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Here we examine the humoral immune response in a subset of human volunteers enrolled in a phase 1 rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination trial by performing comprehensive single B cell and electron microscopy structure analyses. Four studied vaccinees show polyclonal, yet reproducible and convergent B cell responses with shared sequence characteristics. EBOV-targeting antibodies cross-react with other Ebolavirus species, and detailed epitope mapping revealed overlapping target epitopes with antibodies isolated from EVD survivors. Moreover, in all vaccinees, we detected highly potent EBOV-neutralizing antibodies with activities comparable or superior to the monoclonal antibodies currently used in clinical trials. These include antibodies combining the IGHV3–15/IGLV1–40 immunoglobulin gene segments that were identified in all investigated individuals. Our findings will help to evaluate and direct current and future vaccination strategies and offer opportunities for novel EVD therapies.

https://openalex.org/W2978549968,"An aim of molecular biomarkers is to stratify patients with cancer into disease subtypes predictive of outcome, improving diagnostic precision beyond clinical descriptors such as tumor stage1. Transcriptomic intratumor heterogeneity (RNA-ITH) has been shown to confound existing expression-based biomarkers across multiple cancer types2-6. Here, we analyze multi-region whole-exome and RNA sequencing data for 156 tumor regions from 48 patients enrolled in the TRACERx study to explore and control for RNA-ITH in non-small cell lung cancer. We find that chromosomal instability is a major driver of RNA-ITH, and existing prognostic gene expression signatures are vulnerable to tumor sampling bias. To address this, we identify genes expressed homogeneously within individual tumors that encode expression modules of cancer cell proliferation and are often driven by DNA copy-number gains selected early in tumor evolution. Clonal transcriptomic biomarkers overcome tumor sampling bias, associate with survival independent of clinicopathological risk factors, and may provide a general strategy to refine biomarker design across cancer types."
https://openalex.org/W2979165129,"The essential product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene is dystrophin1, a rod-like protein2 that protects striated myocytes from contraction-induced injury3,4. Dystrophin-related protein (or utrophin) retains most of the structural and protein binding elements of dystrophin5. Importantly, normal thymic expression in DMD patients6 should protect utrophin by central immunologic tolerance. We designed a codon-optimized, synthetic transgene encoding a miniaturized utrophin (µUtro), deliverable by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Here, we show that µUtro is a highly functional, non-immunogenic substitute for dystrophin, preventing the most deleterious histological and physiological aspects of muscular dystrophy in small and large animal models. Following systemic administration of an AAV-µUtro to neonatal dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, histological and biochemical markers of myonecrosis and regeneration are completely suppressed throughout growth to adult weight. In the dystrophin-deficient golden retriever model, µUtro non-toxically prevented myonecrosis, even in the most powerful muscles. In a stringent test of immunogenicity, focal expression of µUtro in the deletional-null German shorthaired pointer model produced no evidence of cell-mediated immunity, in contrast to the robust T cell response against similarly constructed µDystrophin (µDystro). These findings support a model in which utrophin-derived therapies might be used to treat clinical dystrophin deficiency, with a favorable immunologic profile and preserved function in the face of extreme miniaturization. A gene therapy vector expressing micro-utrophin provides functional replacement of lost dystrophin, and lacks the adverse immunogenicity associated with direct dystrophin therapy, in rodent and canine models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2978130819,"Oncogenesis is driven by germline, environmental and stochastic factors. It is unknown how these interact to produce the molecular phenotypes of tumors. We therefore quantified the influence of germline polymorphisms on the somatic epigenome of 589 localized prostate tumors. Predisposition risk loci influence a tumor’s epigenome, uncovering a mechanism for cancer susceptibility. We identified and validated 1,178 loci associated with altered methylation in tumoral but not nonmalignant tissue. These tumor methylation quantitative trait loci influence chromatin structure, as well as RNA and protein abundance. One prominent tumor methylation quantitative trait locus is associated with AKT1 expression and is predictive of relapse after definitive local therapy in both discovery and validation cohorts. These data reveal intricate crosstalk between the germ line and the epigenome of primary tumors, which may help identify germline biomarkers of aggressive disease to aid patient triage and optimize the use of more invasive or expensive diagnostic assays. Genetic variants in the germ line modulate DNA methylation in tumors and contribute to the aggressiveness of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2979777337,"This paper explores which demographic characteristics substantially bias self-reported physical and cognitive health status of older Europeans. The analysis utilises micro-data for 19 European countries from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe to compare performance-tested outcomes of mobility and memory with their self-reported equivalents. Relative importance analysis based on multinomial logistic regressions shows that the bias in self-reported health is mostly due to reporting heterogeneities between countries and age groups, whereas gender contributes little to the discrepancy. Concordance of mobility and cognition measures is highly related; however, differences in reporting behaviour due to education and cultural background have a larger impact on self-assessed memory than on self-assessed mobility. Southern as well as Central and Eastern Europeans are much more likely to misreport their physical and cognitive abilities than Northern and Western Europeans. Overall, our results suggest that comparisons of self-reported health between countries and age groups are prone to significant biases, whereas comparisons between genders are credible for most European countries. These findings are crucial given that self-assessed data are often the only information available to researchers and policymakers when asking health-related questions."
https://openalex.org/W2979434884,"Kidney fibrosis occurs in almost every type of chronic kidney disease. We found that microRNA (miR)-26a was decreased in the kidney, muscle, and exosomes of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. We hypothesized that exogenous miR-26 could suppresses renal fibrosis and muscle wasting in obstructive kidney disease. For this purpose, we generated exosomes that encapsulated miR-26, then injected these into skeletal muscle of UUO mice. The expression of miR-26a was elevated in serum exosomes from UUO mice following exosome-miR-26a injection. In these mice, muscle wasting has been ameliorated as evidenced by increased muscle weights. In addition, a muscle atrophy marker, myostatin, is increased in UUO muscle; provision of miR-26a abolished this increase. We detected a remote effect of exosomes containing miR-26a in UUO-induced renal fibrosis. The intervention of miR-26a attenuated UUO-induced renal fibrosis as determined by immunohistological assessment of α-smooth muscle actin and Masson's trichrome staining. Furthermore, exogenous miR-26a decreased the protein levels of 2 profibrosis proteins, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and TGF-β1, in UUO kidney. Our data showed that exosomes containing miR-26a prevented muscle atrophy by inhibiting the transcription factor forkhead box O1. Likewise, the exosome-carried miR-26a limited renal fibrosis by directly suppressing CTGF. Our findings provide an experimental basis for exosome-mediated therapy of muscle atrophy and renal fibrosis.-Zhang, A., Wang, H., Wang, B., Yuan, Y., Klein, J. D., Wang, X. H.

Data were analysed (1) prospectively, from baseline to ≥8-month follow-up; and (2) retrospectively, by taking death as index date and comparing results from three cross-sectional subsamples at different stages of illness (time to death ≥6, 5-3 and 2-0 months). Linear mixed models were calculated.A total of 1739 patients (mean age 66, 50% male) from 30 palliative care centers in 12 countries were included.In prospective analyses, quality of life, functioning and symptoms-except nausea/vomiting-remained generally stable over time. In retrospective analyses, patients 2-0 months before death reported significantly lower quality of life and physical functioning scores than those 5-3 months before death, who in turn scored lower than those ≥6 months before death, suggesting progressive decline. Emotional functioning remained initially unchanged, but decreased in the last months. Pain, fatigue and appetite loss showed a stable increase in intensity towards death. Dyspnea, insomnia and constipation increased from 5-3 to 2-0 months before death. Nausea/vomiting only increased when comparing those ≥6 months before death with those 2-0 months before death.While the prospective approach showed predominantly stable patterns for quality of life, functioning and symptom severity throughout study duration, retrospective analyses indicated that deterioration was already apparent before the terminal phase and accelerated close to death. Our findings support the importance of early symptom identification and treatment in this population, and highlight the need for further studies to explore what characterizes those with either lower or higher symptom burden at different time points towards death."

Enzymes that methylate 16S rRNA on N7 of nucleotide G1405 (m7G1405) have been identified in both aminoglycoside-producing and clinically drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria. Using a fluorescence polarization 30S-binding assay and a new crystal structure of the methyltransferase RmtC at 3.14 Å resolution, here we report a structure-guided functional study of 30S substrate recognition by the aminoglycoside resistance-associated 16S rRNA (m7G1405) methyltransferases. We found that the binding site for these enzymes in the 30S subunit directly overlaps with that of a second family of aminoglycoside resistance-associated 16S rRNA (m1A1408) methyltransferases, suggesting that both groups of enzymes may exploit the same conserved rRNA tertiary surface for docking to the 30S. Within RmtC, we defined an N-terminal domain surface, comprising basic residues from both the N1 and N2 subdomains, that directly contributes to 30S-binding affinity. In contrast, additional residues lining a contiguous adjacent surface on the C-terminal domain were critical for 16S rRNA modification but did not directly contribute to the binding affinity. The results from our experiments define the critical features of m7G1405 methyltransferase–substrate recognition and distinguish at least two distinct, functionally critical contributions of the tested enzyme residues: 30S-binding affinity and stabilizing a binding-induced 16S rRNA conformation necessary for G1405 modification.

Most previous work on medication adherence targeting this group of patients has been undertaken across a single year or is questionnaire based. This study aimed to determine medication adherence status and factors affecting adherence 3 years after initiation of hypoglycemic agents, using a nationwide medical claim-based database in Japan.This retrospective study was conducted on data from 884 subjects with T2DM to better understand medication adherence, the effects of polypharmacy, and other factors. We also investigated the effects of medication nonadherence on hemoglobin A1c levels. Proportion of days covered was defined as the number of days for which a hypoglycemic agent was prescribed and in the patient's possession to the number of days in the observation period. A proportion of days covered ≥0.8 were considered adherent, and those with a value <0.8 as nonadherence. Polypharmacy was defined as taking ≥5 medications.Of the 884 patients investigated, 440 were considered adherent during the study period. Significant factors related to adherence included number of medications (3 or 4, or ≥5), male sex, age 50-<60 years, and total number of visits ≥17. Medication adherence was also a factor related to patients with hemoglobin A1c values < 7.0% at the end of the observation period.We surveyed medication adherence for 3 years with post medication initiation, and found that subjects aged 50-<60 years, those with ≥3 concomitant medications, and those with a total number of visits ≥17 were more likely to be adherent and persistent, and more likely to continue their hypoglycemic agents. A high degree of medication adherence was found to have a positive influence on hemoglobin A1c levels."

Methods This prospective, observational cross-sectional study included 93 eyes of 47 healthy subjects with no medical history and ocular history who self-identified as black or white and were matched for age, sex, refractive error, and image quality. Subjects underwent OCTA imaging (RTVue-XR Avanti) of the superficial (SCP) and deep (DCP) capillary plexuses and choriocapillaris. AngioAnalytics was used to analyze vessel density (VD) and choriocapillaris % blood flow area (BFA) in the 1mm-diameter fovea, parafovea, and 3mm-diameter circular area including the fovea and parafovea (3x3mm image). Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) was also analyzed. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate for differences between the study groups. Results Compared to the white subjects in this study, black subjects were found to have: lower foveal VD in the SCP (p<0.05); lower VD in the parafovea and in the 3x3mm image in the DCP (p<0.05); larger FAZ in SCP and DCP (p<0.05); and decreased choriocapillary BFA in the area underlying the fovea, parafovea, and 3x3mm image (p<0.05). Conclusion In our study, our black subjects had decreased macular capillary vasculature compared to matched white subjects, even in early adulthood and the absence of any systemic or ocular conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that retinal and choriocapillary vascular differences may contribute to racial disparities in vulnerability to DR."

Here, we used proteomics to identify proteins associated with Kv2/VAP-containing ER–PM junctions. We found that the VAP-interacting membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) transfer proteins PYK2 N-terminal domain-interacting receptor 2 (Nir2) and Nir3 specifically associate with Kv2.1 complexes. When coexpressed with Kv2.1 and VAPA in HEK293T cells, Nir2 colocalized with cell-surface–conducting and -nonconducting Kv2.1 isoforms. This was enhanced by muscarinic-mediated PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, leading to dynamic recruitment of Nir2 to Kv2.1 clusters. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, exogenously expressed Nir2 did not strongly colocalize with Kv2.1, unless exogenous VAPA was also expressed, supporting the notion that VAPA mediates the spatial association of Kv2.1 and Nir2. Immunolabeling signals of endogenous Kv2.1, Nir2, and VAP puncta were spatially correlated in cultured neurons. Fluorescence-recovery-after-photobleaching experiments revealed that Kv2.1, VAPA, and Nir2 have comparable turnover rates at ER–PM junctions, suggesting that they form complexes at these sites. Exogenous Kv2.1 expression in HEK293T cells resulted in significant differences in the kinetics of PtdIns(4,5)P2 recovery following repetitive muscarinic stimulation, with no apparent impact on resting PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(4)P levels. Finally, the brains of Kv2.1-knockout mice had altered composition of PtdIns lipids, suggesting a crucial role for native Kv2.1-containing ER–PM junctions in regulating PtdIns lipid metabolism in brain neurons.

Causes and predictors of neonatal death are known to vary in different settings and across different contexts. This study aimed to assess predictors, causes, and trends of neonatal mortality amongst neonates admitted to Nekemte Referral Hospital neonatal unit between 2010–2014. Methods Retrospective data was collected for 2090 live born neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Nekemte Referral Hospital by reviewing records between 2010 to 2014. Variables were collected from the neonatal registration book and patient card on the predictors, causes, and trends of neonatal death using a standard checklist developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Data was analyzed using Epi info version 3.5.1, and SPSS version 25 for windows. The level of significance was set at P<0.05 with the corresponding confidence intervals at 95%. A logistic regression model was used for analysis and to control for confounders. Microsoft Excel 2007 was used to construct the trend analysis. Results There were 183 deaths in the cohort equivalent to 8.8% of deaths among total admitted neonates during the study period. Early neonatal deaths accounted for 8% and late neonatal deaths accounted for 0.71% of deaths among total admitted neonates. Main predictors identified for an increased risk of neonatal mortality were; neonates from rural residents [AOR 1.35, (95% CI, 1.35–1.87)], birth order of greater than five [AOR 5.10, (95% CI, 1.15–22.63)], home delivery [AOR 3.41, (95% CI, 2.24–5.19)], very low birth weight [AOR 6.75, (95% CI, 3.63–12.54)] and low birth weight [AOR 2.81, (95% CI, 1.95–4.05)] and inability to cry at birth [AOR 2.21, (95% CI, 1.51–3.22)]. The trend analysis showed a sharp fall for the neonatal mortality over the last five years with a mean reduction of 16%. Conclusions Data from the Nekemte Referral Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit analysis revealed majority of the deaths were occurred during early neonatal period. The main predictors of neonatal mortality identified from this study needs strengthening an appropriate public health intervention through addressing antenatal care, curbing home delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2980090014,"Since 1990, the world's homicide rate has declined by nearly 20%. While prior research has documented parallel homicide declines across many individual countries, the causes of a shared international homicide decline remain unknown. Drawing on a worldwide process of population ageing, and on research linking age to criminal activity, this study investigates the contribution of global demographic shifts to the international homicide decline.We draw from (1) a High Coverage Sample of 126 countries since 1990, and (2) a Long Series Sample of 26 countries since 1960 and utilize fixed-effect regressions to evaluate the impact of age structure on homicide trends. In addition, we use a quantile regression to explore variations in the relationship between age structure and homicide conditional on homicide levels.Results using the High Coverage Sample suggest no relationship between age structure and homicide. However, results from the Long Series Sample suggest that changes in the relative size of countries' youth population is a major predictor of homicide trends since 1960. In exploring this divergence, we find that the influence of age structure on homicide becomes less evident as other risk factors for violence gain prominence. Thus, while high homicide countries had the most to gain from falling homicide rates, the safety benefits of an ageing population have been concentrated among the least violent countries.While the homicide declines of individual countries have often been attributed to domestic policies, the universality of international homicide trends suggests the influence of broader global phenomenon. We find that countries' homicide trends are strongly associated with changes in the size of their youth populations, particularly where there are few competing criminogenic forces. Based on these results, we propose an explanation for the international homicide decline, while highlighting the importance of demographic patterns in explaining homicide trends."

Here, we investigated the effects of various exogenously supplied carbohydrates on capsule production and gene expression in several pneumococcal serotypes. Microscopy analyses indicated a near absence of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) when S. pneumoniae was grown on fructose. Moreover, serotype 7F pneumococci produced much less CPS than strains of other serotypes (6B, 6C, 9V, 15, and 23F) when grown on glucose or sucrose. RNA-sequencing revealed carbon source-dependent regulation of distinct genes of WT strains and capsule-switch mutants of serotypes 6B and 7F, but could not explain the mechanism of capsule thickness regulation. In contrast, 31P NMR of whole-cell extract from capsule-knockout strains (Δcps) clearly revealed the accumulation or absence of capsule precursor metabolites when cells were grown on glucose or fructose, respectively. This finding suggests that fructose uptake mainly results in intracellular fructose 1-phosphate, which is not converted to CPS precursors. In addition, serotype 7F strains accumulated more precursors than did 6B strains, indicating less efficient conversion of precursor metabolites into the CPS in 7F, in line with its thinner capsule. Finally, isotopologue sucrose labeling and NMR analyses revealed that the uptake of the labeled fructose subunit into the capsule is <10% that of glucose. Our findings on the effects of carbon sources on CPS production in different S. pneumoniae serotypes may contribute to a better understanding of pneumococcal diseases and could inform future therapeutic approaches.

https://openalex.org/W2979772778,"In nature, protozoa play a major role in controlling bacterial populations. This paper proposes a microfluidic device for the study of protozoa behaviors change due to their chemotactic response in the presence of bacterial cells. A three-channel microfluidic device was designed using a nitrocellulose membrane into which channels were cut using a laser cutter. The membrane was sandwiched between two glass slides; a Euglena suspension was then allowed to flow through the central channel. The two side channels were filled with either, 0.1% peptone as a negative control, or a Listeria suspension respectively. The membrane design prevented direct interaction but allowed Euglena cells to detect Listeria cells as secretions diffused through the nitrocellulose membrane. A significant number of Euglena cells migrated toward the chambers near the bacterial cells, indicating a positive chemotactic response of Euglena toward chemical cues released from Listeria cells. Filtrates collected from Listeria suspension with a series of molecular weight cutoffs (3k, 10k and 100k) were examined in Euglena chemotaxis tests. Euglena cells were attracted to all filtrates collected from the membrane filtration with different molecular weight cutoffs, suggesting small molecules from Listeria might be the chemical cues to attract protozoa. Headspace volatile organic compounds (VOC) released from Listeria were collected, spiked to 0.1% peptone and tested as the chemotactic effectors. It was discovered that the Euglena cells responded quickly to Listeria VOCs including decanal, 3,5- dimethylbenzaldehyde, ethyl acetate, indicating bacterial VOCs were used by Euglena to track the location of bacteria."

Remarkably, CYD0618 not only strongly inhibited growth of multiple cancer cell lines that harbor constitutive STAT3 activation, but it also suppressed in vivo tumor growth via STAT3 inhibition. Taken together, our findings suggest Cys-542 as a druggable site for selectively inhibiting STAT3 and indicate that CYD0618 represents a promising lead compound for developing therapeutic agents against STAT3-driven diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2979314498,"Background Little has been documented about partner violence among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) who are out of school, a factor associated with HIV acquisition. To understand areas for prioritising HIV prevention intervention efforts, we explored the prevalence and correlates of partner violence among out of school AGYW in Shinyanga, Tanzania. Methods A cross-sectional analysis of data from AGYW aged 15–23 years recruited in a cluster randomised trial conducted between October and December 2017 was used to examine correlates of partner violence. Data were collected through an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-interview. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association. Results 2276 (75.5%) AGYW were sexually active. Of these, 816 (35.9%) reported having experienced violence from partners in the last six months. After adjusting for other covariates, being formerly married (AOR = 1.55, 95% CI:1.02, 2.37), having children (AOR = 1.79, 95% CI:1.47, 2.16), anxiety and depression symptoms (AOR = 3.27, 95%CI: 2.15, 4.96), having engaged in sex work in the past six months (AOR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.45, 2.53) and economic deprivation (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.34,1.92) were significantly associated with partner violence. Conclusions Almost one in three sexually active AGYW had experienced partner violence in the 6 months preceding the survey. The findings underscore the need for future research to focus on understanding the reasons and dynamics underlying high level of partner violence among AGYW. Furthermore, there is a need for implementing intervention programs that aim to reduce economic deprivation among AGYWs and address social norms and structures perpetuating violence against AGYW.

In the present study, a reliable and rapid identification method was established for Escherichia coli and Shigella species based on a short-term high-lactose culture using MALDI-TOF MS and artificial neural networks (ANN).The Escherichia coli and Shigella species colonies, treated with (Condition 1)/without (Condition 2) a short-term culture with an in-house developed high-lactose fluid medium, were prepared for MALDI-TOF MS assays. The MS spectra were acquired in linear positive mode, with a mass range from 2000 to 12000 Da and were then compared to discover new biomarkers for identification. Finally, MS spectra data sets 1 and 2, extracted from the two conditions, were used for ANN training to investigate the benefit on bacterial classification produced by the new biomarkers.Twenty-seven characteristic MS peaks from the Escherichia coli and Shigella species were summarized. Seven unreported MS peaks, with m/z 2330.745, m/z 2341.299, m/z 2371.581, m/z 2401.038, m/z 3794.851, m/z 3824.839 and m/z 3852.548, were discovered in only the spectra from the E. coli strains after a short-term high-lactose culture and were identified as belonging to acid shock protein. The prediction accuracies of the ANN models, based on data set 1 and 2, were 97.71±0.16% and 74.39±0.34% (n = 5), with an extremely remarkable difference (p < 0.001), and the areas under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.72 and 0.99, respectively.In summary, adding a short-term high-lactose culture approach before the analysis enabled a reliable and easy differentiation of Escherichia coli from the Shigella species using MALDI-TOF MS and ANN."

Detailed observations support the establishment of a new allosauroid, Siamraptor suwati gen. et sp. nov. This new taxon is based on a composite cranial and postcranial skeleton comprising premaxilla, maxilla, jugal, surangular, prearticular, articular, vertebrae, manual ungual, ischium, tibia, and pedal phalanx. It is distinguished from other allosauroids by characters such as a jugal with straight ventral margin and dorsoventrally deep anterior process below the orbit, a surangular with a deep oval concavity at the posterior end of the lateral shelf and four posterior surangular foramina, a long and narrow groove along the suture between the surangular and the prearticular, an articular with a foramen at the notch of the suture with the prearticular, an anterior cervical vertebra with a pneumatic foramen (so-called ‘pleurocoel’) excavating parapophysis, and cervical and posterior dorsal vertebrae penetrated by a pair of small foramina bilaterally at the base of the neural spine. The presence of a huge number of camerae and pneumatopores in cranial and axial elements reveals a remarkable skeletal pneumatic system in this new taxon. Moreover, the phylogenetic analyses revealed that Siamraptor is a basal taxon of Carcharodontosauria, involving a new sight of the paleobiogeographical context of this group. Siamraptor is the best preserved carcharodontosaurian theropod in Southeast Asia, and it sheds new light on the early evolutionary history of Carcharodontosauria."
https://openalex.org/W2979871539,"Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion in lakes is a widespread problem and is mainly controlled by the sediment oxygen uptake (SOU) and flux of reduced substances out of the sediments (Fred). Especially in eutrophic lakes, Fred may constitute a major fraction of the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate, but its size and source is often poorly understood. Using a diagenetic reaction-transport model supported by a large data set of sediment porewater concentrations, bulk sediment core data and lake monitoring data, the behavior of Fred was simulated in eutrophic Lake Baldegg. Transient boundary conditions for the gross sedimentation of total organic carbon and for hypolimnetic O2 concentrations were applied to simulate the eutrophication and re-oligotrophication history of the lake. According to the model, Fred is dominated by methanogenesis, where up to70% to the total CH4 is produced from sediments older than 20 years deposited during the time of permanent anoxia between 1890 and 1982. An implementation of simplified seasonal variations of the upper boundary conditions showed that their consideration is not necessary for the assessment of annual average fluxes in long-term simulations. Four lake management scenarios were then implemented to investigate the future development of Fred and SOU until 2050 under different boundary conditions. A comparison of three trophic scenarios showed that further reduction of the lake productivity to at least a mesotrophic state is required to significantly decrease Fred and SOU from the present state. Conversely, a termination of artificial aeration at the present trophic state would result in high rates of organic matter deposition and a long-term increase of Fred from the sediments of Lake Baldegg."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of drug-induced hearing loss (DIHL) by using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database and to obtain profiles of DIHL onset in clinical settings. We relied on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms and standardized queries, and calculated the reporting odds ratios (RORs). Furthermore, we applied multivariate logistic regression analysis, association rule mining, and time-to-onset analysis using Weibull proportional hazard models. Of 534688 reports recorded in the JADER database from April 2004 to June 2018, adverse event signals were detected for platinum compounds, sulfonamides (plain) (loop diuretics), interferons, ribavirin, other aminoglycosides, papillomavirus vaccines, drugs used in erectile dysfunction, vancomycin, erythromycin, and pancuronium by determining RORs. The RORs of other aminoglycosides, other quaternary ammonium compounds, drugs used in erectile dysfunction, and sulfonamides (plain) were 29.4 (22.4–38.6), 18.5 (11.2–30.6), 15.4 (10.6–22.5), and 12.6 (10.0–16.0), respectively. High lift score was observed for patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia treated with pancuronium using association rule mining. The median durations (interquartile range) for DIHL due to platinum compounds, sulfonamides (plain), interferons, antivirals for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, other aminoglycosides, carboxamide derivatives, macrolides, and pneumococcal vaccines were 25.5 (7.5–111.3), 80.5 (4.5–143.0), 64.0 (14.0–132.0), 53.0 (9.0–121.0), 11.0 (3.0–26.8), 1.5 (0.3–11.5), 3.5 (1.3–6.8), and 2.0 (1.0–4.5), respectively. Our results demonstrated potential risks associated with several drugs based on their RORs. We recommend to closely monitor patients treated with aminoglycosides for DIHL for at least two weeks.

There are limited evidences on the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. This study was undertaken in Maharashtra, a province, located in the western region of the country, to inform policy regarding the effectiveness of this programme. The objective was to estimate the unit cost of ART services for pediatric HIV patients and examine the efficiency in the use of resource and treatment compliance resulting from telemedicine initiatives in pediatric HIV compared to usual ART services.We selected 6 ART centers (3 from linked centers linked to Pediatric HIV Centre of Excellence (PCoE) and 3 from non-linked centers) randomly from three high, middle and low ART centers, categorized on the basis of case load in each arm. A bottom up costing methodology was adopted to understand the unit cost of services. Loss to follow up and timeliness of the visits were compared between the two arms and were linked to the cost.The average cost per-visit was INR 1803 in the linked centers and that for the non-linked centers was INR 3412. There has been 5 percentage point improvement in lost to follow-up in the linked centers compared to non-linked centers against a back-drop of a reduction in per-pediatric patient cost of INR 557. The linkage has resulted in increase in timeliness of the visits in linked centers compared to non-linked centers.The telemedicine linkage led to an increase in the case load leading to a decrease in cost. The evidence on efficiency in the use of resource and improvement in treatment compliance as suggested by this study could be used to scale up this initiative."

Although the molecular weight of GL was identical to that of fructoselysine (FL), GL was distinguishable from FL because GL was resistant to acid hydrolysis, which converted all of the FLs to furosine.

https://openalex.org/W2980188983,"Background Malnutrition among children is one of the most pressing health concerns middle- and low-income countries face today, particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Early-life malnutrition has been shown to affect long-term health and income. One hypothesized channel linking early-life malnutrition and long-term outcomes is cognitive development. However, there is limited empirical evidence on the relationship between nutritional status and cognitive achievement in middle childhood. Study design As part of the South India Community Health Study (SICHS), we collected educational attainment and anthropometric data from 1,194 children in rural Vellore district of Tamil Nadu, India, and assessed their math and reading skills. We analyzed the relationship between continuous and binary anthropometric measures of nutritional status and three measures of cognitive achievement (reading, math, and grade level), adjusting for potential confounders, using a regression framework. Results Lower height-for-age and weight-for-age and their corresponding binary measures (stunting, underweight) were associated with lower reading scores, lower math scores, and lower grade level, with the exception of the association between weight-for-age and reading, which was marginally significant. A stunted child had one-third of a grade disadvantage compared to a non-stunted counterpart, whereas an underweight child had one-fourth of a grade disadvantage compared to a non-underweight counterpart. Lower BMI-for-age was associated with grade level and marginally associated with lower math scores, and its binary measure (thinness) was marginally associated with lower math scores. Conclusions Acute and chronic malnutrition in middle childhood were negatively associated with math scores, reading scores, and educational attainment. Our study provides new evidence that cognitive achievement during middle childhood could be an important mechanism underlying the association between early-life malnutrition and long-term wellbeing."

Wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6 and OLFM4 null mice were subjected to intestinal IR injury and then monitored for survival or tissues harvested for further analyses. In vivo intestinal barrier function was determined via functional assay of permeability to FITC-dextran. OLFM4 null mice had a significant 7-d survival benefit and less intestinal barrier dysfunction compared with WT. Early after IR, WT mice had worse mucosal damage on histologic examination. Experiments involving adoptive transfer of bone marrow demonstrated that the mortality phenotype associated with OLFM4-positive neutrophils was transferrable to OLFM4 null mice. After IR injury, WT mice also had increased intestinal tissue activation of NFκB and expression of iNOS, 2 signaling pathways previously demonstrated to be involved in intestinal IR injury. In combination, these experiments show that OLFM4-positive neutrophils are centrally involved in the pathologic pathway leading to intestinal damage and mortality after IR injury. This may provide a therapeutic target for mitigation of intestinal IR injury in a variety of common clinical situations.-Levinsky, N. C., Mallela, J., Opoka, A., Harmon, K., Lewis, H.

https://openalex.org/W2979470121,"Existing algorithms of speech-based deception detection are severely restricted by the lack of sufficient number of labelled data. However, a large amount of easily available unlabelled data has not been utilized in reality. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a semi-supervised additive noise autoencoder model for deception detection. This model updates and optimizes the semi-supervised autoencoder and it consists of two layers of encoder and decoder, and a classifier. Firstly, it changes the activation function of the hidden layer in network according to the characteristics of the deception speech. Secondly, in order to prevent over-fitting during training, the specific ratio dropout is added at each layer cautiously. Finally, we directly connected the supervised classification task in the output of encoder to make the network more concise and efficient. Using the feature set specified by the INTERSPEECH 2009 Emotion Challenge, the experimental results on Columbia-SRI-Colorado (CSC) corpus and our own deception corpus show that the proposed model can achieve more advanced performance than other alternative methods with only a small amount of labelled data."
https://openalex.org/W2979640688,"Gastric emptying (GE) can be either delayed or accelerated in diabetes mellitus (DM). However, most research has focused on delayed GE mediated by a chronic hyperglycemic condition in DM. As such, the function of GE in the early stages of DM is not well understood. Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are pacemaker cells in the gastrointestinal tract. In the present study, we investigated changes in GE and ICC networks in the early stages of DM using a streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mouse model. The changes in GE were measured by the 13C-octanoic acid breath test. ICC networks were immunohistochemically detected by an antibody for c-Kit, a specific marker for ICC. Our results showed that GE in type 1 DM was significantly accelerated in the early stages of DM (2-4 weeks after onset). In addition, acute normalization of blood glucose levels by a single administration of insulin did not recover normal GE. ICC networks of the gastric antrum were significantly increased in DM and were not affected by the acute normalization of blood glucose. In conclusion, our results suggest that GE is accelerated in the early stages of DM, and it is associated with increased ICC networks. This mechanism may help to clarify a link between the onset of DM and GE disorders."

We aimed to develop and validate a diabetes risk score based on easily accessible clinical data. Methods Prospective study including 5277 participants (55.0% women, 51.8±10.5 years) free of diabetes at baseline. Comparison with two other published diabetes risk scores (Balkau and Kahn clinical, respectively 5 and 8 variables) and validation on three cohorts (Europe, Iran and Mexico) was performed. Results After a mean follow-up of 10.9 years, 405 participants (7.7%) developed diabetes. Our score was based on age, gender, waist circumference, diabetes family history, hypertension and physical activity. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.772 for our score, vs. 0.748 (p<0.001) and 0.774 (p = 0.668) for the other two. Using a 13-point threshold, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (95% CI) of our score were 60.5 (55.5–65.3), 77.1 (75.8–78.2), 18.0 (16.0–20.1) and 95.9 (95.2–96.5) percent, respectively. Our score performed equally well or better than the other two in the Iranian [AUC 0.542 vs. 0.564 (p = 0.476) and 0.513 (p = 0.300)] and Mexican [AUC 0.791 vs. 0.672 (p<0.001) and 0.778 (p = 0.575)] cohorts. In the European cohort, it performed similarly to the Balkau score but worse than the Kahn clinical [AUC 0.788 vs. 0.793 (p = 0.091) and 0.816 (p<0.001)]. Diagnostic capacity of our score was better than the Balkau score and comparable to the Kahn clinical one.

The aim of this study was to determine the role of Dam DNA methylation in P. luminescens during the whole bacterial life cycle including during symbiosis with H. bacteriophora. We constructed a strain overexpressing dam by inserting an additional copy of the dam gene under the control of a constitutive promoter in the chromosome of P. luminescens and then achieved association between this recombinant strain and nematodes. The dam overexpressing strain was able to feed the nematode in vitro and in vivo similarly as a control strain, and to re-associate with Infective Juvenile (IJ) stages in the insect. No difference in the amount of emerging IJs from the cadaver was observed between the two strains. Compared to the nematode in symbiosis with the control strain, a significant increase in LT50 was observed during insect infestation with the nematode associated with the dam overexpressing strain. These results suggest that during the life cycle of P. luminescens, Dam is not involved the bacterial symbiosis with the nematode H. bacteriophora, but it contributes to the pathogenicity of the nemato-bacterial complex."
https://openalex.org/W2979901027,"A number of studies carried out since the early ‘70s has investigated the effects of isolation on genetic variation within and among human populations in diverse geographical contexts. However, no extensive analysis has been carried out on the heterogeneity among genomes within isolated populations. This issue is worth exploring since events of recent admixture and/or subdivision could potentially disrupt the genetic homogeneity which is to be expected when isolation is prolonged and constant over time. Here, we analyze literature data relative to 87,815 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which were obtained from a total of 28 European populations. Our results challenge the traditional paradigm of population isolates as structured as genetically (and genomically) uniform entities. In fact, focusing on the distribution of variance of intra-population diversity measures across individuals, we show that the inter-individual heterogeneity of isolated populations is at least comparable to the open ones. More in particular, three small and highly inbred isolates (Sappada, Sauris and Timau in Northeastern Italy) were found to be characterized by levels of inter-individual heterogeneity largely exceeding that of all other populations, possibly due to relatively recent events of genetic introgression. Finally, we propose a way to monitor the effects of inter-individual heterogeneity in disease-gene association studies."
https://openalex.org/W2979973582,"Extrusion of xenobiotics is essential for allowing animals to remove toxic substances present in their diet or generated as a biproduct of their metabolism. By transporting a wide range of potentially noxious substrates, active transporters of the ABC transporter family play an important role in xenobiotic extrusion. One such class of transporters are the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein transporters. Here, we investigated P-glycoprotein transport in the Malpighian tubules of the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria), a species whose diet includes plants that contain toxic secondary metabolites. To this end, we studied transporter physiology using a modified Ramsay assay in which ex vivo Malpighian tubules are incubated in different solutions containing the P-glycoprotein substrate dye rhodamine B in combination with different concentrations of the P-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil. To determine the quantity of the P-glycoprotein substrate extruded we developed a simple and cheap method as an alternative to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, radiolabelled alkaloids or confocal microscopy. Our evidence shows that: (i) the Malpighian tubules contain a P-glycoprotein; (ii) tubule surface area is positively correlated with the tubule fluid secretion rate; and (iii) as the fluid secretion rate increases so too does the net extrusion of rhodamine B. We were able to quantify precisely the relationships between the fluid secretion, surface area, and net extrusion. We interpret these results in the context of the life history and foraging ecology of desert locusts. We argue that P-glycoproteins contribute to the removal of xenobiotic substances from the haemolymph, thereby enabling gregarious desert locusts to maintain toxicity through the ingestion of toxic plants without suffering the deleterious effects themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2979403232,"Two novel and related pathogenic variants of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene were structurally and functionally characterized. These alterations have not been previously described in literature. Two patients with diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) based on the presence of one mutated allele, p.Phe508del, pathological sweat test and clinical symptoms were studied. To complete the genotypes of both patients, an extensive genetic and functional analysis of the CFTR gene was performed. Extensive genetic characterization confirmed the presence of p.Phe508del pathogenic variant and revealed, in both patients, the presence of an insertion of part of intron 10 in intron 9 of the CFTR gene, within the (TG)m repeat, with a variable poly-T stretch. The molecular lesions resulted to be very similar in both patients, with only a difference in the number of T in the poly-T stretch. The functional characterization at RNA level revealed a complete anomalous splicing, without exon 10, from the allele with the insertion of both patients. Consequently, the alleles with the insertions are expected not to contribute to the formation of a functional CFTR protein. Molecular and functional features of these alterations are compatible with the definition of novel CF-causing variants of the CFTR gene. This also allowed the completion of the genetic characterization of both patients."
