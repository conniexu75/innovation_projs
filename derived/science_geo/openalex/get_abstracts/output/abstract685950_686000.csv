https://openalex.org/W4200339067,"High-throughput sequencing projects generate genome-scale sequence data for species-level phylogenies1-3. However, state-of-the-art Bayesian methods for inferring timetrees are computationally limited to small datasets and cannot exploit the growing number of available genomes4. In the case of mammals, molecular-clock analyses of limited datasets have produced conflicting estimates of clade ages with large uncertainties5,6, and thus the timescale of placental mammal evolution remains contentious7-10. Here we develop a Bayesian molecular-clock dating approach to estimate a timetree of 4,705 mammal species integrating information from 72 mammal genomes. We show that increasingly larger phylogenomic datasets produce diversification time estimates with progressively smaller uncertainties, facilitating precise tests of macroevolutionary hypotheses. For example, we confidently reject an explosive model of placental mammal origination in the Palaeogene8 and show that crown Placentalia originated in the Late Cretaceous with unambiguous ordinal diversification in the Palaeocene/Eocene. Our Bayesian methodology facilitates analysis of complete genomes and thousands of species within an integrated framework, making it possible to address hitherto intractable research questions on species diversifications. This approach can be used to address other contentious cases of animal and plant diversifications that require analysis of species-level phylogenomic datasets."
https://openalex.org/W4200081848,"Present-day people from England and Wales have more ancestry derived from early European farmers (EEF) than did people of the Early Bronze Age1. To understand this, here we generated genome-wide data from 793 individuals, increasing data from the Middle to the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age in Britain by 12-fold, and western and central Europe by 3.5-fold. Between 1000 and 875 bc, EEF ancestry increased in southern Britain (England and Wales) but not northern Britain (Scotland) due to incorporation of migrants who arrived at this time and over previous centuries, and who were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from France. These migrants contributed about half the ancestry of people of England and Wales from the Iron Age, thereby creating a plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain. These patterns are part of a broader trend of EEF ancestry becoming more similar across central and western Europe in the Middle to the Late Bronze Age, coincident with archaeological evidence of intensified cultural exchange2–6. There was comparatively less gene flow from continental Europe during the Iron Age, and the independent genetic trajectory in Britain is also reflected in the rise of the allele conferring lactase persistence to approximately 50% by this time compared to approximately 7% in central Europe where it rose rapidly in frequency only a millennium later. This suggests that dairy products were used in qualitatively different ways in Britain and in central Europe over this period. Genome-wide ancient DNA data from individuals from the Middle Bronze Age to Iron Age documents large-scale movement of people from the European continent between 1300 and 800 bc that was probably responsible for spreading early Celtic languages to Britain."
https://openalex.org/W4200386511,"In human embryos, the initiation of transcription (embryonic genome activation [EGA]) occurs by the eight-cell stage, but its exact timing and profile are unclear. To address this, we profiled gene expression at depth in human metaphase II oocytes and bipronuclear (2PN) one-cell embryos. High-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing revealed previously inaccessible oocyte-to-embryo gene expression changes. This confirmed transcript depletion following fertilization (maternal RNA degradation) but also uncovered low-magnitude upregulation of hundreds of spliced transcripts. Gene expression analysis predicted embryonic processes including cell-cycle progression and chromosome maintenance as well as transcriptional activators that included cancer-associated gene regulators. Transcription was disrupted in abnormal monopronuclear (1PN) and tripronuclear (3PN) one-cell embryos. These findings indicate that human embryonic transcription initiates at the one-cell stage, sooner than previously thought. The pattern of gene upregulation promises to illuminate processes involved at the onset of human development, with implications for epigenetic inheritance, stem-cell-derived embryos, and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4200432194,"Morphogen gradients are fundamental to establish morphological patterns in developing tissues1. During development, gradients scale to remain proportional to the size of growing organs2,3. Scaling is a universal gear that adjusts patterns to size in living organisms3-8, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Here, focusing on the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) gradient in the Drosophila wing disc, we uncover a cell biological basis behind scaling. From small to large discs, scaling of the Dpp gradient is achieved by increasing the contribution of the internalized Dpp molecules to Dpp transport: to expand the gradient, endocytosed molecules are re-exocytosed to spread extracellularly. To regulate the contribution of endocytosed Dpp to the spreading extracellular pool during tissue growth, it is the Dpp binding rates that are progressively modulated by the extracellular factor Pentagone, which drives scaling. Thus, for some morphogens, evolution may act on endocytic trafficking to regulate the range of the gradient and its scaling, which could allow the adaptation of shape and pattern to different sizes of organs in different species."

As future physicians, medical students play a critical role in the public's view of the vaccine.To determine the attitude of U.S. medical students toward mandating the COVID-19 vaccine to healthcare workers and patients, as well as whether their knowledge of the vaccine plays a role in their view.The authors emailed a survey link to all U.S. medical schools with request to distribute it to their medical students. The survey remained open from 02/09/2021 to 03/15/2021 and included questions to determine the attitude of the medical students toward recommending the COVID-19 vaccine, and general knowledge questions about the vaccine. Chi square, Fisher's exact test, and linear regression were conducted to determine associations between willingness to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine and general knowledge of the vaccine.Among the 1,899 responses from medical students representing 151 U.S. medical schools, 57.82% approved of making the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory to healthcare workers, and 16.27% approved of making it mandatory to patients. Additionally, those who tested most knowledgeable of the vaccine were less likely to approve of making the vaccine mandatory for patients (66.67% vs. 72.70). Those that tested most knowledgeable were also more likely to personally receive the vaccine (72.35% vs 62.99%) as opposed to those that tested the least knowledgeable who were less willing to personally receive the vaccine (4.12% vs 14.17%).The data revealed that a slight majority of medical students support a vaccine mandate toward healthcare workers while a minority of medical students support a vaccine mandate toward healthcare workers. Additionally, medical students that had relatively high knowledge of the vaccine correlated with not approving of making the vaccine mandatory for patients. However increased knowledge of the vaccine correlated with increased willingness to personally receive the vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4200248806,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, US populations have experienced elevated rates of financial and psychological distress that could lead to increases in suicide rates. Rapid ongoing mental health monitoring is critical for early intervention, especially in regions most affected by the pandemic, yet traditional surveillance data are available only after long lags. Novel information on real-time population isolation and concerns stemming from the pandemic's social and economic impacts, via cellular mobility tracking and online search data, are potentially important interim surveillance resources. Using these measures, we employed transfer function model time-series analyses to estimate associations between daily mobility indicators (proportion of cellular devices completely at home and time spent at home) and Google Health Trends search volumes for terms pertaining to economic stress, mental health, and suicide during 2020 and 2021 both nationally and in New York City. During the first pandemic wave in early-spring 2020, over 50% of devices remained completely at home and searches for economic stressors exceeded 60,000 per 10 million. We found large concurrent associations across analyses between declining mobility and increasing searches for economic stressor terms (national proportion of devices at home: cross-correlation coefficient (CC) = 0.6 (p-value <0.001)). Nationally, we also found strong associations between declining mobility and increasing mental health and suicide-related searches (time at home: mood/anxiety CC = 0.53 (<0.001), social stressor CC = 0.51 (<0.001), suicide seeking CC = 0.37 (0.006)). Our findings suggest that pandemic-related isolation coincided with acute economic distress and may be a risk factor for poor mental health and suicidal behavior. These emergent relationships warrant ongoing attention and causal assessment given the potential for long-term psychological impact and suicide death. As US populations continue to face stress, Google search data can be used to identify possible warning signs from real-time changes in distributions of population thought patterns."
https://openalex.org/W4200285308,"Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the use of digital devices, especially smartphones, remarkably increased. Smartphone use belongs to one's daily routine, but can negatively impact physical and mental health, performance, and relationships if used excessively. The present study aimed to investigate potential correlates of problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity and the mechanisms underlying its development. Data of 516 smartphone users from Germany (Mage = 31.91, SDage = 12.96) were assessed via online surveys in April and May 2021. PSU severity was significantly negatively associated with sense of control. In contrast, it was significantly positively linked to fear of missing out (FoMO), repetitive negative thinking (RNT), and daily time spent on smartphone use. In a moderated mediation analysis, the negative relationship between sense of control and PSU severity was significantly mediated by FoMO. RNT significantly moderated the positive association between FoMO and PSU severity. Specifically, the higher the RNT, the stronger the relationship between FoMO and PSU. The present findings disclose potential mechanisms that could contribute to PSU. Potential ways of how to reduce PSU severity are discussed."

Here, we aimed to determine the effect of COVID-19 severity on the memory B cell response and characterize changes in the memory B cell compartment between recovery and five months post-symptom onset. Using high-parameter spectral flow cytometry, we analyzed the phenotype of memory B cells with reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) in recovered individuals who had been hospitalized with non-severe (n = 8) or severe (n = 5) COVID-19. One month after symptom onset, a substantial proportion of spike-specific IgG+ B cells showed an activated phenotype. In individuals who experienced non-severe disease, spike-specific IgG+ B cells showed increased expression of markers associated with durable B cell memory, including T-bet and FcRL5, as compared to individuals who experienced severe disease. While the frequency of T-bet+ spike-specific IgG+ B cells differed between the two groups, these cells predominantly showed an activated switched memory B cell phenotype in both groups. Five months post-symptom onset, the majority of spike-specific memory B cells had a resting phenotype and the percentage of spike-specific T-bet+ IgG+ memory B cells decreased to baseline levels. Collectively, our results highlight subtle differences in the B cells response after non-severe and severe COVID-19 and suggest that the memory B cell response elicited during non-severe COVID-19 may be of higher quality than the response after severe disease."
https://openalex.org/W4226219605,"Many authors have suggested that the vulnerability of montane biodiversity to climate change worldwide is significantly higher than in most other ecosystems. Despite the extensive variety of studies predicting severe impacts of climate change globally, few studies have empirically validated the predicted changes in distribution and population density. Here, we used 17 years (2000-2016) of standardised bird monitoring across latitudinal/elevational gradients in the rainforest of the Australian Wet Tropics World Heritage Area to assess changes in local abundance and elevational distribution. We used relative abundance in 1977 surveys across 114 sites ranging from 0-1500m above sea level and utilised a trend analysis approach (TRIM) to investigate elevational shifts in abundance of 42 species. The local abundance of most mid and high elevation species has declined at the lower edges of their distribution by >40% while lowland species increased by up to 190% into higher elevation areas. Upland-specialised species and regional endemics have undergone dramatic population declines of almost 50%. The ""Outstanding Universal Value"" of the Australian Wet Tropics World Heritage Area, one of the most irreplaceable biodiversity hotspots on Earth, is rapidly degrading. These observed impacts are likely to be similar in many tropical montane ecosystems globally."
https://openalex.org/W4200364085,"One of the most pressing challenges facing food systems in Africa is ensuring availability of a healthy and sustainable diet to 2.4 billion people by 2050. The continent has struggled with development challenges, particularly chronic food insecurity and pervasive poverty. In Africa’s food systems, fish and other aquatic foods play a multifaceted role in generating income, and providing a critical source of essential micronutrients. To date, there are no estimates of investment and potential returns for domestic fish production in Africa. To contribute to policy debates about the future of fish in Africa, we applied the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agriculture Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) to explore two Pan-African scenarios for fish sector growth: a business-as-usual ( BAU ) scenario and a high-growth scenario for capture fisheries and aquaculture with accompanying strong gross domestic product growth ( HIGH ). Post-model analysis was used to estimate employment and aquaculture investment requirements for the sector in Africa. Africa’s fish sector is estimated to support 20.7 million jobs in 2030, and 21.6 million by 2050 under the BAU . Approximately 2.6 people will be employed indirectly along fisheries and aquaculture value chains for every person directly employed in the fish production stage. Under the HIGH scenario, total employment in Africa’s fish food system will reach 58.0 million jobs, representing 2.4% of total projected population in Africa by 2050. Aquaculture production value is estimated to achieve US$ 3.3 billion and US$ 20.4 billion per year under the BAU and HIGH scenarios by 2050, respectively. Farm-gate investment costs for the three key inputs (fish feeds, farm labor, and fish seed) to achieve the aquaculture volumes projected by 2050 are estimated at US$ 1.8 billion per year under the BAU and US$ 11.6 billion per year under the HIGH scenario. Sustained investments are critical to sustain capture fisheries and support aquaculture growth for food system transformation towards healthier diets."
https://openalex.org/W4200611311,"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an increasingly serious public health problem, and it has caused an outbreak in China every year since 2008. Predicting the incidence of HFMD and analyzing its influential factors are of great significance to its prevention. Now, machine learning has shown advantages in infectious disease models, but there are few studies on HFMD incidence based on machine learning that cover all the provinces in mainland China. In this study, we proposed two different machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to perform our analysis and prediction. We first used Random Forest to examine the association between HFMD incidence and potential influential factors for 31 provinces in mainland China. Next, we established Random Forest and XGBoost prediction models using meteorological and social factors as the predictors. Finally, we applied our prediction models in four different regions of mainland China and evaluated the performance of them. Our results show that: 1) Meteorological factors and social factors jointly affect the incidence of HFMD in mainland China. Average temperature and population density are the two most significant influential factors; 2) Population flux has different delayed effect in affecting HFMD incidence in different regions. From a national perspective, the model using population flux data delayed for one month has better prediction performance; 3) The prediction capability of XGBoost model was better than that of Random Forest model from the overall perspective. XGBoost model is more suitable for predicting the incidence of HFMD in mainland China."
https://openalex.org/W4200031215,"Disordered gaming has gained increased medical attention and was recently included in the eleventh International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization (WHO) after its earlier inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth revision) (DSM-5) as an emerging disorder by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Although many studies have investigated associations between personality and disordered gaming, no previous research compared the differential associations between personality and disordered gaming with time spent gaming. Due to the novelty of the WHO diagnostic framework for disordered gaming, previous research focused mainly on the associations between personality and disordered gaming in relation to the APA framework. Beyond that, these studies are generally limited by small sample sizes and/or the lack of cross-cultural emphasis due to single-country sampling. To address these limitations, the present study aimed to investigate the associations between personality and gaming behavior in a large and culturally heterogeneous sample (N = 50,925) of individuals from 150 countries. The results obtained suggested that low conscientiousness and high neuroticism were robustly associated with disordered gaming across both the APA and WHO frameworks. Interestingly, personality associations with weekly time spent gaming were smaller. The findings of the present study suggest that personality is of higher importance to predict disordered gaming compared to weekly time spent gaming."
https://openalex.org/W4200120981,"Dual-task walking may lead to gait instability and a higher fall risk in older adults, particularly when walking in a busy city street. Challenging street features such as narrow sidewalks not only discourage walking, but are also likely to be taxing for older adults' cognitive resources and gait characteristics. The aim of this study was to assess the way older adults' gait characteristics are affected by walking on a narrow path while performing a challenging cognitive task in lab conditions imitating common urban environments. Nineteen young and eighteen older adults walked on a narrow (40cm) and a wide (80cm) path and performed a cognitive (n-back) task individually adjusted to 80% accuracy. The two tasks were performed separately (Single-Task) and concurrently (Dual-Task). Both groups walked faster, and their step width was narrower on the narrow path. During dual-task walking on the narrow path, older adults showed significant dual-task costs in the cognitive task, gait speed, step width, and stride length. Dual-task walking was associated with decreased gait speed and stride length in both age groups, suggesting that dual-task walking may adversely affect gait, particularly when walking on narrow paths. These conditions may lead to gait instability and an increased fall risk for older adults, particularly when walking along the narrow sidewalks commonly found within the built environment. However, more research is needed in an urban setting to determine the extent of the fall risk narrow sidewalks present for older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4200053053,"Background First reported case of Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Kazakhstan was identified in March 2020. Many specialized tertiary hospitals in Kazakhstan including National Research Cardiac Surgery Center (NRCSC) were re-organized to accept coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients during summer months of 2020. Although many studies from worldwide reported their experience in treating patients with COVID-19, there are limited data available from the Central Asia countries. The aim of this study is to identify predictors of mortality associated with COVID-19 in NRCSC tertiary hospital in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to the NRCSC between June 1 st –August 31 st 2020 with COVID-19. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected from electronic records. In-hospital mortality was assessed as an outcome. Patients were followed-up until in-hospital death or discharge from the hospital. Descriptive statistics and factors associated with mortality were assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results Two hundred thirty—nine admissions were recorded during the follow-up period. Mean age was 57 years and 61% were males. Median duration of stay at the hospital was 8 days and 34 (14%) patients died during the hospitalization. Non-survivors were more likely to be admitted later from the disease onset, with higher fever, lower oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate compared to survivors. Leukocytosis, lymphopenia, anemia, elevated liver and kidney function tests, hypoproteinemia, elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) and coagulation tests (fibrinogen, D-dimer, international normalized ratio (INR), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)) at admission were associated with mortality. Age (OR 1.2, CI:1.01–1.43), respiratory rate (OR 1.38, CI: 1.07–1.77), and CRP (OR 1.39, CI: 1.04–1.87) were determined to be independent predictors of mortality. Conclusion This study describes 14% mortality rate from COVID-19 in the tertiary hospital. Many abnormal clinical and laboratory variables at admission were associated with poor outcome. Age, respiratory rate and CRP were found to be independent predictors of mortality. Our finding would help healthcare providers to predict the risk factors associated with high risk of mortality. Further investigations involving large cohorts should be provided to support our findings."
https://openalex.org/W4200447186,"It is becoming clearer that living cells use water/water (w/w) phase separation to form membraneless organelles that exhibit various important biological functions. Currently, it is believed that the specific localization of biomacromolecules, including DNA, RNA and proteins in w/w microdroplets is closely related to their bio-activity. Despite the importance of this possible role of micro segregation, our understanding of the underlying physico-chemical mechanism is still unrefined. Further research to unveil the underlying mechanism of the localization of macromolecules in relation to their steric conformation in w/w microdroplets is needed.Single-DNA observation of genome-size DNA (T4 GT7 bacteriophage DNA; 166kbp) by fluorescence microscopy revealed that DNAs are spontaneously incorporated into w/w microdroplets generated in a binary aqueous polymer solution with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran (DEX). Interestingly, DNAs with elongated coil and shrunken conformations exhibit Brownian fluctuation inside the droplet. On the other hand, tightly packed compact globules, as well as assemblies of multiple condensed DNAs, tend to be located near the interface in the droplet.The specific localization of DNA molecules depending on their higher-order structure occurs in w/w microdroplet phase-separation solution under a binary aqueous polymer solution. Such an aqueous solution with polymers mimics the crowded conditions in living cells, where aqueous macromolecules exist at a level of 30-40 weight %. The specific positioning of DNA depending on its higher-order structure in w/w microdroplets is expected to provide novel insights into the mechanism and function of membraneless organelles and micro-segregated particles in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W4200143869,"We investigated the contributions of platelet microRNAs (miRNAs) to the rate of growth and regulation of gene expression in primary ectopic tumors using mouse models. We previously identified an inhibitory role for platelets in solid tumor growth, mediated by tumor infiltration of platelet microvesicles (microparticles) which are enriched in platelet-derived miRNAs. To investigate the specific roles of platelet miRNAs in tumor growth models, we implanted pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells as a bolus into mice with megakaryocyte-/platelet-specific depletion of mature miRNAs. We observed an ~50% increase in the rate of growth of ectopic primary tumors in these mice compared to controls including at early stages, associated with reduced apoptosis in the tumors, in particular in tumor cells associated with platelet microvesicles-which were depleted of platelet-enriched miRNAs-demonstrating a specific role for platelet miRNAs in modulation of primary tumor growth. Differential expression RNA sequencing of tumor cells isolated from advanced primary tumors revealed a broad cohort of mRNAs modulated in the tumor cells as a function of host platelet miRNAs. Altered genes comprised 548 up-regulated transcripts and 43 down-regulated transcripts, mostly mRNAs altogether spanning a variety of growth signaling pathways-notably pathways related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition-in tumor cells from platelet miRNA-deleted mice compared with those from control mice. Tumors in platelet miRNA-depleted mice showed more sarcomatoid growth and more advanced tumor grade, indicating roles for host platelet miRNAs in tumor plasticity. We further validated increased protein expression of selected genes associated with increased cognate mRNAs in the tumors due to platelet miRNA depletion in the host animals, providing proof of principle of widespread effects of platelet miRNAs on tumor cell functional gene expression in primary tumors in vivo. Together, these data demonstrate that platelet-derived miRNAs modulate solid tumor growth in vivo by broad-spectrum restructuring of the tumor cell transcriptome."
https://openalex.org/W4200192452,"Introduction In December 2020, the first two COVID-19 vaccines were approved in the United States (U.S.) and recommended for distribution to front-line personnel, including nurses. Nursing students are being prepared to fill critical gaps in the health care workforce and have played important supportive roles during the current pandemic. Research has focused on vaccine intentions of current health care providers and less is known about students’ intentions to vaccinate for COVID-19. Methods A national sample of undergraduate nursing students were recruited across five nursing schools in five U.S. regions in December 2020. The survey measured perceived risk/threat of COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccine attitudes, perceived safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, sources for vaccine information and level of intention to become vaccinated [primary, secondary (i.e., delayed), or no intention to vaccinate]. Results The final sample consisted of 772 students. The majority (83.6%) had intentions to be vaccinated, however of those 31.1% indicated secondary intention, a delay in intention or increased hesitancy). The strongest predictors of primary intention were positive attitudes (OR = 6.86; CI = 4.39–10.72), having lower safety concerns (OR = 0.26; CI = 0.18–0.36), and consulting social media as a source of information (OR = 1.56; CI = 1.23–1.97). Asian (OR = 0.47; CI = 0.23–0.97) and Black (OR 0.26; CI = 0.08–0.80) students were more likely to indicate secondary intention as compared to primary intention. Students in the Midwest were most likely to indicate no intention as compared to secondary intention (OR = 4.6; CI = 1.32–16.11). Conclusions As the first two COVID-19 vaccines were approved/recommended in the U.S. nursing students had overall high intentions to vaccinate. Findings can guide development of educational interventions that reduce concerns of vaccine safety that are delivered in a way that is supportive and affirming to minoritized populations while being respectful of geo-political differences."
https://openalex.org/W4200130710,"Firm's effort on Green technology innovation (hereafter, called G-innovation) is affected by financing constraints, and firm will make a discretionary choice according to its own situation, to achieve the maximization of self-interests. Based on the data of Chinese micro enterprises, firstly, we empirically analyze firms' decision-making towards G-innovation when faced with financing constraints. It supports the view that financing constraints can hinder enterprise technological innovation. And we also make an explanation that the social benefits of green technology innovation are greater than personal benefits, which makes enterprises tend to reduce green technology innovation when facing financing constraints. Then we examine firms' heterogonous behaviors under different internal attributes and external environments. The results reveal that: First, firms are reluctant to pay more efforts to G-innovation when faced with increased financing constraints. Second, firms with different attributes exhibit heterogeneous G-innovation. Political connections will change firms' willingness to innovate, while the structure of property rights and the pollution degree will not. Third, firms under different external environment also exhibit heterogeneous G-innovation. When economic policy uncertainty increases, firms' willingness to innovate weakens.

Structural Vector Auto-regressive techniques have been inducted to explore the relationship between monetary policy effectiveness and financial inclusion. The study covers the secondary data of 10 developed and 30 underdeveloped countries throughout 2004-2018. It is concluded that monetary policy effectiveness and financial inclusion do not have a contemporaneous impact on each other. Nevertheless, the reduced-form Vector Auto-regressive witness the reverse causality between financial inclusion and monetary policy effectiveness in developed countries. Thus, effective monetary policy enhances financial inclusion in a country, and a higher degree of financial inclusion lowers the inflation rate and makes monetary policy effective. One way causality from monetary policy effectiveness to financial inclusion can be observed in under-developed countries. Using the Structural Vector auto-regressive technique and financial inclusion index composed of three-dimension to examine the relationship of monetary policy effectiveness and financial inclusion in developed and developing countries is considered the study's significant contribution."
https://openalex.org/W4200618267,"Military identity and a sense of social connectedness may help explain differences in contemporary veteran wellbeing following transition from military to civilian life. However, it is unclear how these constructs interrelate. The current study quantitatively explored the role of social connectedness in the relationship between military identity and subjective wellbeing among contemporary ex-serving Australian Defence Force veterans. To facilitate analyses, data from 358 veterans were used to first explore the suitability of the factor structure of the Warrior Identity Scale. Subsequently, the potential moderating and mediating effects of social connectedness in the relationship between military identity and wellbeing were explored via path analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis of the Warrior Identity Scale revealed support for the multidimensional construct of military identity, and a revised six-factor measurement model was found suitable for further path analysis. Consistent with past research, social connectedness positively related to quality of life and negatively related to psychological distress. There was no support for a moderation effect of social connectedness. However, results indicated military identity indirectly influenced wellbeing and distress via differential relationships with social connectedness. Specifically, private and public regard for the military and not feeling like an outsider positively related to social connectedness. In contrast, interdependence with other veterans, viewing the military as family, and the centrality of military identity negatively related to social connectedness. The results suggest nurturing the protective aspects of military identity and addressing inhibitory aspects of military identity may support a sense of social connectedness and wellbeing among ex-serving veterans."
https://openalex.org/W4200021053,"Pragmatic challenges remain in the monitoring and return to play (RTP) decisions following suspected Sports Related Concussion (SRC). Reliance on traditional approaches (pen and paper) means players readiness for RTP is often based on self-reported symptom recognition as a marker for full physiological recovery. Non-digital approaches also limit opportunity for robust data analysis which may hinder understanding of the interconnected nature and relationships in deficit recovery. Digital approaches may provide more objectivity to measure and monitor impairments in SRC. Crucially, there is dearth of protocols for SRC assessment and digital devices have yet to be tested concurrently (multimodal) in SRC rugby union assessment.

https://openalex.org/W4200240328,"Drucker's knowledge-worker productivity theory and knowledge-based view of the firm theory are widely employed in many disciplines but there is little application of these theories in knowledge-based innovation among academic researchers. Therefore, this study intends to evaluate the effects of the knowledge management process on knowledge-based innovation alongside with mediating role of Malaysian academic researchers' productivity during the Pandemic of COVID-19. Using a random sampling technique, data was collected from 382 academic researchers. Questionnaires were self-administered and data was analyzed via Smart PLS-SEM. Knowledge management process and knowledge workers' productivity have a positive and significant relationship with the knowledge-based innovation among academic researchers during the Pandemic of COVID-19. In addition, knowledge workers' productivity mediates the relationship between the knowledge management process (knowledge creation, knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing, and knowledge utilization) and knowledge-based innovation during the Pandemic of COVID-19. Results have also directed knowledge sharing as the key factor in knowledge-based innovation and a stimulating task for management discipline around the world during the Pandemic of COVID-19. This study provides interesting insights on Malaysian academic researchers' productivity by evaluating the effects of knowledge creation, acquisition, sharing, and application on the knowledge-based innovation among academic researchers during the Pandemic of COVID-19. These useful insights would enable policymakers to develop more influential educational strategies. By assimilating the literature of defined variables, the main contribution of this study is the evaluation of knowledge creation, acquisition, sharing, and utilization into knowledge-based innovation alongside the mediating role of knowledge workers productivity in the higher education sector of Malaysia during the Pandemic of COVID-19."

A total of 161 (59.4%) of patients had poor glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥8.1%; 95% CI: 53.6 to 65.3%). Poor glycaemic control was significantly associated with high body mass index of the patient (AOR 13.22; 95% CI: 1.95 to 89.80), having only elementary education (AOR 5.22, 95% CI 2.12-12.86, p<0.0001) and being on insulin therapy (AOR 2.88; 95% CI: 1.05 to 7.88). On the other hand, seldom coffee intake (AOR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.64), high physical activity (AOR 1.57, 95% CI 1.06-2.35, p = 0.025) and having a cardiovascular disease (AOR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.46) appeared to positively influence glycaemic control. Self-monitoring of blood glucose and diet interventions did not appear to influence glycaemic control.The study results showing that a high proportion of patients attending the Diabetes Clinic with uncontrolled diabetes has serious implications for the management of T2DM diabetes as it suggests that current hospital-based treatment measures are less effective. Comprehensive management of T2DM targeting all the key factors identified in this study and incorporating a multispectral collaborative effort based on holistic approach, combined with non-pharmacological components are strongly warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4200512652,"The risk of infectious mononucleosis (IM) is affected both by crowding and by sibship structure, i.e., number and signed age differential between an index child and a sibling. Siblings provide protection against IM by pre-empting delayed primary Epstein-Barr virus infection with its associated high risk of IM. The association between childcare attendance and risk of IM, on the other hand, has never been studied in a large, well-characterized cohort.Danish children born in July 1992 through 2016 with a completely known simple childcare attendance history before age 1.5 years (n = 908,866) were followed up for a hospital contact with an IM diagnosis at ages 1.5-26 years. Hazard ratios (HRs) of IM for an additional year of exposure were obtained from stratified Cox regression analyses, stratified by sex and year of birth, with age as the underlying time scale, adjusted for sibship structure, and sociodemographic variables including parental ethnicity and maternal age.An additional year of exclusively attending a daycare home (max 5 children) yielded HR = 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.81-1.00), and similarly, each year of exclusively attending a childcare institution (e.g., crèche) yielded HR = 0.94 (0.84-1.06).Forwarding enrollment in childcare by a year lowers the risk of IM later in life much less than having an additional sibling of comparable age and has no practical public health implications. We find our results suggestive of a random threshold for successful Epstein-Barr virus infection that is more easily reached by a sibling than the collective of playmates in daycare homes or childcare institutions."
https://openalex.org/W4200212525,"The continuous rise of the world's population has made food security a major point of the global agenda, with fisheries providing a key source of nutrition, especially in developing countries. Ensuring their health is key to maintain the availability of the resource, but its effect over accessibility is yet unclear. In this paper, we discuss the relevance of stock health for ensuring the price accessibility of the resource. A Least Square Dummy Variable panel model is proposed for bluefin tuna prices, with a biological explanatory component, and dummy variables reflecting changes in fishing trends. Both have proven to be significant to explain annual price variations, with improvements in stock health achieving price reductions."
https://openalex.org/W4200231996,"Abstract 3′UTR shortening in cancer has been shown to activate oncogenes, partly through the loss of microRNA-mediated repression. This suggests that many reported microRNA-oncogene target interactions may not be present in cancer cells. One of the most well-studied oncogenes is the transcription factor MYC, which is overexpressed in more than half of all cancers. MYC overexpression is not always accompanied by underlying genetic aberrations. In this study, we demonstrate that the MYC 3′UTR is shortened in colorectal cancer (CRC). Using unbiased computational and experimental approaches, we identify and validate microRNAs that target the MYC coding region. In particular, we show that miR-138 inhibits MYC expression and suppresses tumor growth of CRC and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Critically, the intravenous administration of miR-138 significantly impedes MYC-driven tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our results highlight the previously uncharacterized shortening of the MYC 3′UTR in cancer, and identify miR-138 as a potent regulator of the heterogenous MYC transcript population."
https://openalex.org/W4200238645,"Clinical studies on the efficacy of sonic toothbrushes show inconsistent results, most studies have been conducted without sufficient supervision of appropriate toothbrush usage. Aims of the explorative clinical trial were therefore to investigate whether the usage of an activated sonic toothbrush reduces plaque more effectively than an inactivated one used as a manual toothbrush, and to which extent the correct use of such toothbrush plays a role in its efficacy. The clinical trial was designed as a video-controlled interventional study. Thirty participants (mean (±SD) age 22.9 (±2.5) years) were included, areas of interest were the buccal surfaces of the upper premolars and the first molar (partial mouth recording). Toothbrushing was performed without toothpaste in a single brushing exercise under four different conditions: switched off, habitually used as manual toothbrush, no instruction; switched on, habitually used as powered toothbrush, no instruction; switched off, used as manual toothbrush, instruction in the Modified Bass Technique; switched on, used as powered toothbrush, instruction in a specific technique for sonic toothbrushes. Brushing performance was controlled by videotaping, plaque was assessed at baseline (after 4 days without toothbrushing) using the Rustogi modified Navy-Plaque-Index and planimetry. Main study results were that plaque decreased distinctly after habitual brushing regardless of using the sonic brush in ON or OFF mode (p for all comparisons < 0.001). After instruction, participants were able to use the sonic brush in ON mode as intended, with only minor impact on efficacy. Using the toothbrush in OFF mode with the Modified Bass Technique was significantly less effective than all other conditions (p for all comparisons < 0.001). Under the conditions used, the sonic toothbrush was not more effective when switched on than when switched off, and there was no evidence that the correct use of the toothbrush was more effective than the habitual use."
https://openalex.org/W4200315567,"During the first-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, dentists were considered at high-risk of infection. In France, to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2, a nationwide lockdown was enforced, during which dentists suspended their routine clinical activities, working solely on dental emergencies. This measure has had an indisputable mitigating effect on the pandemic. To continue protecting dentists after suspension of nationwide lockdown, implementation of preventive measures was recommended, including adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and room aeration between patients. No study has explored whether implementation of such preventive measures since the end of the first-wave has had an impact on the contamination of dentists.An online survey was conducted within a French dentist population between July and September 2020. To explore risk factors associated with COVID-19, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.The results showed that COVID-19 prevalence among the 3497 respondents was 3.6%. Wearing surgical masks during non-aerosol generating procedures was a risk factor of COVID-19, whereas reducing the number of patients was a protective factor.Considering the similar COVID-19 prevalence between dentists and the general population, such data suggest that dentists are not overexposed in their work environment when adequate preventive measures are applied.Dentists should wear specific PPE (FFP2, FFP3 or (K)N95 masks) including during non-aerosol generating procedures and reduce the number of patients to allow proper implementation of disinfection and aeration procedures. Considering the similarities between COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections, such preventive measures may also be of interest to limit emerging variants spread as well as seasonal viral outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W4200439195,"Domestic dogs display behavioural patterns towards their owners that fulfil the four criteria of attachment. As such, they use their owners as a secure base, exploring the environment and manipulating objects more when accompanied by their owners than when alone. Although there are some indications that owners serve as a better secure base than other human beings, the evidence regarding a strong owner-stranger differentiation in a manipulative context is not straightforward. In the present study, we conducted two experiments in which pet dogs were tested in an object-manipulation task in the presence of the owner and of a stranger, varying how the human partner would behave (i.e. remaining silent or encouraging the dog, Experiment 1), and when alone (Experiment 2). Further, to gain a better insight into the mechanisms behind a potential owner-stranger differentiation, we investigated the effect of dogs’ previous life history (i.e. having lived in a shelter or having lived in the same household since puppyhood). Overall, we found that strangers do not provide a secure base effect and that former shelter dogs show a stronger owner-stranger differentiation than other family dogs. As former shelter dogs show more behavioural signs correlated with anxiety towards the novel environment and the stranger, we concluded that having been re-homed does not necessarily affect the likelihood of forming a secure bond with the new owner but might have an impact on how dogs interact with novel stimuli, including unfamiliar humans. These results confirm the owner’s unique role in providing security to their dogs and have practical implications for the bond formation in pet dogs with a past in a shelter."
https://openalex.org/W4200601281,"An underactive bladder can lead to difficulty in voiding that causes incomplete emptying of the bladder, suggesting the need for a new strategy to increase bladder contractility in such patients. This study was performed to investigate whether human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were capable of restoring bladder contractility in rats with underactive bladder due to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and enhancing their effects by overexpressing hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in hMSCs.The hMSCs were transplanted into the bladder wall of rats. Fifty female Sprague-Dawley rats at six weeks of age were divided into five groups: group 1: control; group 2: sham intervention; group 3: eight-week BOO; group 4: BOO rats transplanted with hMSCs; and group 5: BOO rats transplanted with hMSCs overexpressing HGF. Two weeks after the onset of BOO in groups 4 and 5, hMSCs were injected into the bladder wall. Cystometry evaluation was followed by Masson's trichrome staining of bladder tissues. Realtime PCR and immunohistochemical staining were performed to determine for hypoxia, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.Collagen deposition of bladder increased in BOO but decreased after transplantation of hMSCs. The increased inter-contraction interval and residual urine volume after BOO was reversed after hMSCs transplantation. The decreased maximal voiding pressure after BOO was restored by hMSCs treatment. The mRNA expression of bladder collagen1 and TGF-β1 increased in BOO but decreased after hMSCs transplantation. The decrease in vWF-positive cells in the bladder following BOO was increased after hMSCs transplantation. Caspase 3 and TUNEL-positive apoptosis of bladder cells increased in BOO but decreased after transplantation of hMSCs. These effects were enhanced by overexpressing HGF in hMSCs.Transplantation of hMSCs into bladder wall increased the number of micro-vessels, decreased collagen deposition and apoptosis of detrusor muscle, and improved bladder underactivity. The effects were enhanced by overexpressing HGF in hMSCs. Our findings suggest that the restoration of underactive bladder using hMSCs may be used to rectify micturition disorders in patients following resolution of BOO. Further studies are needed before hMSCs can be used in clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4200007891,"Higher education is considered as the engine of the economic development of a country due to its role in cultivating human capital. The provision of higher education is regarded as a productive investment in human capital for improving nation’s productive capacity. However, there is a large gap in enrollment between students of different socioeconomic statuses. The ever-widening socio-economic inequalities between individuals from disadvantaged and advantaged backgrounds make the government’s efforts to enroll a higher number of students to pursue higher education challenging in developing countries, as the students’ socioeconomic status plays a decisive role in their priority to attain higher education. This study anticipated quantifying the impact of socio-economic indicators and underlying situations on students’ enrollment in higher education in Pakistan. A descriptive study, involving correlation, principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, and stepwise regression using 15-years data of enrollment and socio-economic indicators was conducted. The correlation between different socio-economic indicators and students’ enrollment was positive and highly significant (0.73 to 0.99), except for the unemployment rate (- 0.39 to -0.57). PCA showed that the first two components were the most influential with 93.85% of the total variation. Enrollment (total and male) showed significant relationships with general government expenditure and unemployment rate, while female enrollment showed a significant relationship with general government expenditure. Findings revealed that socio-economic factors can serve as a significant predictor of students’ enrollment in higher education. The minimum values of correlation coefficient (R) and adjusted R 2 for enrollment were ranged from 0.875 to 0.748 (female enrollment), while maximum values (0.987 to 0.993 and 0.973 to 0.983), respectively were observed for total enrollment. The findings will assist educationists, social scientists, and policymakers to better understand the association between socio-economic indicators and student enrollment in higher education for formulating future education policies for enhancing enrollment in higher education."
https://openalex.org/W4200012907,"Falls are a common cause of injury and pose an increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and lifelong disability. Falls encompass a troublesome definition and can pose challenges in epidemiological studies. Data on fall-related hospital admissions in Portugal remain unpublished. This study aimed to examine the epidemiology of fall-related hospital admissions in the Portuguese population between 2010 and 2018. It also aimed to examine annual rates of fall-related hospital admissions using three methodological approaches.The Portuguese Hospital Morbidity Database was used to identify all cases resulting in one or more inpatient admission in public hospitals related to falls from 2010 to 2018. Fall-related hospital admissions were described by age groups, sex, geographical area of residence, and type of fall. Annual rates were computed using three approaches: i) based on the number of inpatient admissions with an ICD code of fall, ii) based on the number of patients admitted to inpatient care with an ICD code of fall, and iii) based on the number of inpatient admissions with a principal diagnosis of injury.Between 2010 and 2018, 383,016 fall-related admissions occurred in 344,728 patients, corresponding to 2.1% of the total number of hospitalizations during the same period. Higher rates were seen among the younger (20-25) and the oldest age groups (+85), males until the age of 60, females from the age of 60, and areas of residence with a higher aging index. An overall rate of falls per 100,000 population was estimated at 414 (based on number of admissions), 373 (based on number of patients) and 353 (based on number of admissions with a principal diagnosis of injury).This study provides an overall picture of the landscape of falls in a scarcely explored setting. The results aim to contribute to identifying appropriate preventive interventions and policies for these populations."
https://openalex.org/W4200189000,"This paper examines how values and professional socialization in business schools impact the formulation of students' contextualized view of social responsibility. We propose the empirical concept of a mental gap between the existing and the wished-for level of a business school's corporate social responsibility and estimate it empirically by using a sample of business school students from Central and South East Europe. Results show that students wish their business schools to reduce their current orientation toward economic outcomes and focus on environmental and social responsibilities. We interpret those empirical results in terms of the students' wish to balance achieving economic prosperity and enjoyment of life with the prosocial outcomes of their education. New student generations' perception of corporate social responsibility is not shaped by the professional socialization patterns but rather by the own perceptions, which can be influenced by experiential approaches to academic teaching and learning. Based on these empirical results, implications for academic practice and future research are explored."
https://openalex.org/W4200237668,"CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Interleukin (IL)-15 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which is over-expressed in SLE patients. In the present study, we investigated the iNKT cell expansion of mononuclear cells (MNCs) from SLE patients following 10 days’ culture with α-galactosylceramide (α-Galcer) and /or IL-15. We sought to determine the phenotypic and functional characteristics of the expanded iNKT cells compared to healthy controls and correlated with disease activity. We observed that 1. The percentages of Vα24+/Vβ11+ iNKT cells following 10-day incubation was lower in SLE groups compared to controls; 2. The percentages and absolute numbers of Vα24+/Vβ11+ iNKT cells were expanded by α-galactosylceramide (α-Galcer), and further enhanced with IL-15 in SLE patient, but the effect of IL-15 was much lower than controls; 3.IL-15 +α-Galcer expanded CD3+/CD56+ NKT-like cells from SLE patients, especially with active disease 4. The CD161+ Vα24+/Vβ11+ iNKT cells in SLE were more responsive to α-Galcer stimulation than the CD161- counterpart; 5. IL-15 decreased apoptosis of α-Galcer activated SLE iNKT cells; 6. IL-15 enhanced CD69, CD1d and CD11a expression on α-Galcer treated iNKT cells; 7. The IL-4 production of iNKT cells was decreased in SLE patients compared to controls; 8. IL-15 increased IFN-γ and IL-4 production of SLE iNKT cells; 8. IL-15 failed to augment the ability of iNKT cells to aid NK-mediated K562 cytolysis in SLE patients; 9. CD161 positivity, granzyme B and perforin expression of α-Galcer+IL-15 expanded iNKT cells correlated with C3 levels in SLE patients. Taken together, our results demonstrated numeric and functional deficiency of iNKT cells and their response to IL-15 in SLE patients. Our finding may provide insight for using adoptive iNKT cell therapy in autoimmune diseases."

The direction and magnitude of voltage production is hypothesized to be dependent on the available substrates. A sensor technology was developed for compounds indicative of anthropological activity by exposing tMFCs to gasoline, petroleum, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, fertilizer, and urea. A machine learning classifier was trained to identify compounds based on the voltage patterns. After 5 to 10 days, the mean voltage stabilized (+/- 0.5 mV). After the entire incubation, voltage ranged from -59.1 mV to 631.8 mV, with the tMFCs containing urea and gasoline producing the highest (624 mV) and lowest (-9 mV) average voltage, respectively. The machine learning algorithm effectively discerned between gasoline, urea, and fertilizer with greater than 94% accuracy, demonstrating that this technology could be successfully operated as an environmental sensor for change detection."
https://openalex.org/W4200386752,"Children can identify who is benevolent or malevolent not only through first-hand experiences and observations but also from the testimony of others. In this study, we investigated whether 5- and 7-year-olds (N = 128) would form their attitudes toward others after hearing testimony about that person's past moral behavior and whether the valence of testimony would differently influence the children. In the positive condition, half of the participants gained information about three puppets: puppet A's prosocial behavior by their own first-hand observation, testimony about puppet B's past prosocial behavior, and testimony about puppet C's past neutral behavior. In the negative condition, the other half also learned information about the three puppets: puppet A's antisocial behavior by their own first-hand observation, testimony about puppet B's past antisocial behavior, and testimony about puppet C's past neutral behavior. Then they engaged in tasks that measured their behavioral attitudes toward the puppets and evaluated the goodness of each puppet to assess their attitudes at a cognitive level. Our results concluded that the children form their behavioral attitudes toward others based on testimony starting at the age of 7, and attitude formation at the cognitive level based on testimony is seen at age 5. Negative testimony, rather than positive testimony, influences the children's attitudes toward others. In addition, the 7-year-olds' use of testimony differs depending whether they are the allocators or the receivers of rewards. Our findings deepen understanding of how children rely on the verbal information around themselves when they navigate interactions with others."

This study explores the present situation on the trade between the Central region of China and ASEAN through empirical assessment and try to find the potential effects and trade flows between them. Firstly, we analysis the trade integration index, HM index, explicit comparative advantage index, and trade complementarity index. Finally, we use the gravity model of international trade and data on 2006-2018. The bilateral trade relations between the central region and ASEAN are getting closer, but the central region has not yet become the major trade area of ASEAN countries in the Chinese market. The bilateral economic development level plays a positive role in promoting the export trade between the Central region and ASEAN, while the bilateral distance plays a negative role in difficulty. The empirical results show that trade potential between the Central region and Indonesia and the Philippines is huge, and there is still opportunity for the development of the trade potential with Thailand. The trade prospective with Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam is limited, and new approaches need to be developed to achieve further trade cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W4200628149,"To realize real-time and accurate performance monitoring of large- and medium-sized seed metering devices, a performance monitoring system was designed for seed metering devices based on LED visible photoelectric sensing technology and a pulse width recognition algorithm. Through an analysis of the of sensing component pointing characteristics and seed motion characteristics, the layout of the sensing components and critical photoelectric sensing system components was optimized. Single-grain seed metering devices were employed as monitoring objects, and the pulse width thresholds for Ekangmian-10 cotton seeds and Zhengdan-958 corn seeds were determined through pulse width threshold calibration experiments employed at different seed metering plate rotational speeds. According to the seeding quantity monitoring experiments, when the seed metering plate rotational speed ranged from 28.31~35.71 rev/min, the accuracy reached 98.41% for Ekangmian-10 cotton seeds. When the seed metering plate rotational speed ranged from 13.78~19.39 rev/min, the seeding quantity monitoring accuracy reached 98.19% for Zhengdan-958 corn seeds. Performance monitoring experiments revealed that the qualified seeding quantity monitoring accuracy of cotton precision seed metering devices, missed seeding quantity monitoring accuracy, and reseeding quantity monitoring accuracy could reach 98.75%, 94.06%, and 91.30%, respectively, within a seeding speed range of 8~9 km/h. This system meets the requirements of real-time performance monitoring of large- and medium-sized precision seed metering devices, which helps to improve the operational performance of seeding machines."

This paper aims at building a framework for analyzing the provincial division of economic zone (DEZ) via considering spatial interaction among regions based on the improved gravity model and clustering approaches. The proposed framework of province DEZ is applied in the case study of Hunan Province, China. The results reveal that Chenzhou city in the south of Hunan Province is always excluded from the DEZ due to its larger external gravity from other cities in neighboring provinces. It also shows that the city components of economic zones (EZs) have experienced a fluctuation at a higher degree from 2002 to 2006 to 2009 while it reached to a stable phase in 2013. Furthermore, cross-provincial regional integration and the highway construction have a significant impact on the change of city components of EZ. The findings are of great potential in regional planning that should be incorporated to the toolkit of regional policy and sustainable development for local governments."

Just over 600 adults were asked to make 25 population estimates for Great Britain, including religious (church/mosque attendance) and economic (income, state benefits, car/house ownership) factors as well as estimates like the number of gay people, immigrants, smokers etc. They were reasonably accurate for things like car ownership, criminal record, vegetarianism and voting but seriously overestimated numbers related to minorities such as the prevalence of gay people, muslims and people not born in the UK. Conversely there was a significant underestimation of people receiving state benefits, having a criminal record or a private health insurance. Correlations between select variables and magnitude and absolute accuracy showed religiousness and IQ most significant correlates. Religious people were less, and intelligent people more, accurate in their estimates. A factor analysis of the estimates revealed five interpretable factors. Regressions were calculated onto these factors and showed how these individual differences accounted for as much as 14% of the variance. Implications and limitations are acknowledged."
https://openalex.org/W4200314210,"Cadherins control intercellular adhesion in most metazoans. In vertebrates, intercellular adhesion differs considerably between cadherins of type-I and type-II, predominantly due to their different extracellular regions. Yet, intercellular adhesion critically depends on actomyosin contractility, in which the role of the cadherin extracellular region is unclear. Here, we dissect the roles of the Extracellular Cadherin (EC) Ig-like domains by expressing chimeric E-cadherin with E-cadherin and cadherin-7 Ig-like domains in cells naturally devoid of cadherins. Using cell-cell separation, cortical tension measurement, tissue stretching and migration assays, we show that distinct EC repeats in the extracellular region of cadherins differentially modulate epithelial sheet integrity, cell-cell separation forces, and cell cortical tension with the Cdc42 pathway, which further differentially regulate epithelial tensile strength, ductility, and ultimately collective migration. Interestingly, dissipative processes rather than static adhesion energy mostly dominate cell-cell separation forces. We provide a framework for the emergence of epithelial phenotypes from cell mechanical properties dependent on EC outside-in signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4200353026,"The transition of patients across care settings is associated with a high risk of errors and preventable medication-related harm. Ensuring effective communication of information between health professionals is considered important for improving patient safety. A National Health Service(NHS) organisation in the North West of England introduced an electronic transfer of care around medicines (TCAM) system which enabled hospital pharmacists to send information about patient's medications to their nominated community pharmacy. We aimed to understand the adoption, and the implications for sustainable use in practice of the TCAM service.We evaluated the TCAM service in a Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and NHS Foundation Trust in Salford, United Kingdom (UK). Participants were opportunistically recruited to take part in qualitative interviews through stakeholder networks and during hospital admission, and included hospital pharmacists, hospital pharmacy technicians, community pharmacists, general practice-based pharmacists, patients and their carers. A thematic analysis, that was iterative and concurrent with data collection, was undertaken using a template approach. The interpretation of the data was informed by broad sociotechnical theory.Twenty-three interviews were conducted with health care professionals patients and carers. The ways in which the newly implemented TCAM intervention was adopted and used in practice and the perceptions of it from different stakeholders were conceptualised into four main thematic areas: The nature of the network and how it contributed to implementation, use and sustainability; The material properties of the system; How work practices for medicines safety were adapted and evolved; and The enhancement of medication safety activities. The TCAM intervention was perceived as effective in providing community pharmacists with timely, more accurate and enhanced information upon discharge. This allowed for pharmacists to enhance clinical services designed to ensure that accurate medication reconciliation was completed, and the correct medication was dispensed for the patient.By providing pharmacy teams with accurate and enhanced information the TCAM intervention supported healthcare professionals to establish and/or strengthen interprofessional networks in order to provide clinical services designed to ensure that accurate medication reconciliation and dispensing activities were completed. However, the intervention was implemented into a complex and at times fragmented network, and we recommend opportunities be explored to fully integrate this network to involve patients/carers, general practice pharmacists and two-way communication between primary and secondary care to further enhance the reach and impact of the TCAM service."
https://openalex.org/W4200360918,"To quickly and efficiently recognize abnormal patterns from large-scale time series and pathological signals in epilepsy, this paper presents here a preliminary RSW&TST framework for Multiple Change-Points (MCPs) detection based on the Random Slide Window (RSW) and Trigeminal Search Tree (TST) methods. To avoid the remaining local optima, the proposed framework applies a random strategy for selecting the size of each slide window from a predefined collection, in terms of data feature and experimental knowledge. For each data segment to be diagnosed in a current slide window, an optimal path towards a potential change point is detected by TST methods from the top root to leaf nodes with O(log3(N)). Then, the resulting MCPs vector is assembled by means of TST-based single CP detection on data segments within each of the slide windows. In our experiments, the RSW&TST framework was tested by using large-scale synthetic time series, and then its performance was evaluated by comparing it with existing binary search tree (BST), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)-statistics, and T-test under the fixed slide window (FSW) approach, as well as the integrated method of wild binary segmentation and CUSUM test (WBS&CUSUM). The simulation results indicate that our RSW&TST is both more efficient and effective, with a higher hit rate, shorter computing time, and lower missed, error and redundancy rates. When the proposed RSW&TST framework is executed for MCPs detection on pathological ECG (electrocardiogram)/EEG (electroencephalogram) recordings of people in epileptic states, the abnormal patterns are roughly recognized in terms of the number and position of the resultant MCPs. Furthermore, the severity of epilepsy is roughly analyzed based on the strength and period of signal fluctuations among multiple change points in the stage of a sudden epileptic attack. The purpose of our RSW&TST framework is to provide an encouraging platform for abnormal pattern recognition through MCPs detection on large-scale time series quickly and efficiently."

https://openalex.org/W4200063988,"Clinical metagenomics is a powerful diagnostic tool, as it offers an open view into all DNA in a patient's sample. This allows the detection of pathogens that would slip through the cracks of classical specific assays. However, due to this unspecific nature of metagenomic sequencing, a huge amount of unspecific data is generated during the sequencing itself and the diagnosis only takes place at the data analysis stage where relevant sequences are filtered out. Typically, this is done by comparison to reference databases. While this approach has been optimized over the past years and works well to detect pathogens that are represented in the used databases, a common challenge in analysing a metagenomic patient sample arises when no pathogen sequences are found: How to determine whether truly no evidence of a pathogen is present in the data or whether the pathogen's genome is simply absent from the database and the sequences in the dataset could thus not be classified? Here, we present a novel approach to this problem of detecting novel pathogens in metagenomic datasets by classifying the (segments of) proteins encoded by the sequences in the datasets. We train a neural network on the sequences of coding sequences, labeled by taxonomic domain, and use this neural network to predict the taxonomic classification of sequences that can not be classified by comparison to a reference database, thus facilitating the detection of potential novel pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4200274142,"Background Bilateral internal thoracic arteries (BITA) are uncommonly used in the every-day practice due to safety concerns and technical challenges with Y-grafts. We hypothesized that in-situ BITA use during coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG) for two vessel disease is equally safe to standard strategy with left internal thoracic artery-left anterior descending artery revascularization and venous graft to other target vessels. Methods A propensity score matched analysis was used to compare elective on-pump CABG patients who received in-situ BITA (BITA-group), versus left internal thoracic artery graft to the left anterior descending artery plus vein (SITA-group). Primary end points were 30-days all-cause-mortality, major adverse cardiac events and incidents and deep sternal wound infections. Results A total of 50 matched pairs (c-statistics 0.769) were selected from patients operated on between January 2015 and April 2020 using BITA (n = 50) and SITA (n = 2170). There were no inter-group differences in demographics and basic clinical characteristics. The total operation time was longer in the BITA-group (4.0 vs 3.6 hours; p = 0.004). The rate of complete revascularization was similar, as was median aortic cross-clamp time, median extracorporeal circulation time, rate of re-explorations for bleeding, deep sternal wound infections or length of stay. One patient died in BITA group, 3 days after surgery, from a non-cardiac cause. After 36 months, the survival rate was 98% for BITA-group and 96% for controls (log-rank, p = 0.577). Conclusions In-situ use of BITA during coronary revascularization for two-vessel disease is as safe and effective, as use of single ITA and vein graft. In-situ strategy abolishes allows to avoid the technically demanding composite graft configuration."
https://openalex.org/W4200318838,"This study examined people's motivations for (repeatedly) utilizing HIV testing services during community-based testing events in urban and rural Shinyanga, Tanzania and potential implications for Universal Health Coverage (UHC).As part of a broader multidisciplinary study on the implementation of a HIV Test and Treat model in Shinyanga Region, Tanzania, this ethnographic study focused on community-based testing campaigns organised by the implementing partner. Between April 2018 and December 2019, we conducted structured observations (24), short questionnaires (42) and in-depth interviews with HIV-positive (23) and HIV-negative clients (8). Observations focused on motivations for (re-)testing, and the counselling and testing process. Thematic analysis based on inductive and deductive coding was completed using NVivo software.Regular HIV testing was encouraged by counsellors. Most participants in testing campaigns were HIV-negative; 51.1% had tested more than once over their lifetimes. Testing campaigns provided an accessible way to learn one's HIV status. Motivations for repeat testing included: monitoring personal health to achieve (temporary) reassurance, having low levels of trust toward sexual partners, feeling at risk, seeking proof of (ill)-health, and acting responsibly. Repeat testers also associated testing with a desire to start treatment early to preserve a healthy-looking body, should they prove HIV positive.Community-based testing campaigns serve three valuable functions related to HIV prevention and treatment: 1) enable community members to check their HIV status regularly as part of a personalized prevention strategy that reinforces responsible behaviour; 2) identify recently sero-converted clients who would not otherwise be targeted; and 3) engage community with general prevention and care messaging and services. This model could be expanded to include routine management of other (chronic) diseases and provide an entry for scaling up UHC."

Food fortification with multiple micronutrients (MMN) is provided for children between 6-23 months, daily for two months at three-time points. We assessed the acceptance and adherence of this nutritional intervention in an urban community setting in Sri Lanka. This cross-sectional study enrolled caregivers of children aged 7 to 23 months with a cluster sampling method. Caregivers ' acceptance of taste and smell, health gains, ease of use, and need perception (Cronbach's reliability: 0.801) were assessed. Also, anemia knowledge (Cronbach's reliability: 0.642), MMN knowledge, and reported adherence (number of sachets consumed per month) were evaluated through a self-administered questionnaire. Adequate adherence was defined as the use of ≥80% sachets. The univariate and multivariate statistical analysis examined the association of acceptability, adherence, and anemia knowledge with independent variables (socio-demographic, household characteristics, and knowledge). The survey included 153 respondents. The Median (range) age of children was 12 months (7-23). The mean (SD) acceptability score was 66.82% (9.78%). Acceptance of sensory qualities (smell/taste) had a lower score than perceived health benefit. Most consumed MMN adequately (72.5%). The mean (SD) anemia knowledge score was 62.20% (25.79%). In multivariate analysis, child's age (OR: -0.360, 95% CI:-0.510,-0.211) and father's education (OR: 2.148, 95% CI: 0.439, 3.857) were independently associated with acceptability. Child's age (OR: -0.108, 95% CI:0.818, 0.985), anemia knowledge (OR:0.016, 95% CI: 1.003, 1.031) and acceptability (OR:0.236, 95% CI:1.140, 1.406) were significant determinants of adherence. Anemia knowledge was significantly associated with the mother's education and household income when adjusted. In conclusion, unpleasant smell/taste and daily schedule were reported as barriers to MMN use. Yet, perception and trust regarding health benefits were encouraging. Reported adherence was somewhat high. Improving acceptability and anemia knowledge could enhance adherence further in this population."
https://openalex.org/W4200461389,"The travel trajectory data of mobile intelligent terminal users are characterized by clutter, incompleteness, noise, fuzzy randomness. The accuracy of original data is an essential prerequisite for better results of trajectory data mining. The Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is one of the most effective trajectory data mining methods, but the selection of input parameters often limits it. The Sage-Husa adaptive filtering algorithm effectively controls the error range of mobile phone GPS data, which can meet the positioning accuracy requirements for DBSCAN spatial clustering having the advantages of low cost and convenient use. Then, a novel cluster validity index was proposed based on the internal and external duty cycle to balance the influence of the distance within-cluster, the distance between clusters, and the number of coordinate points in the process of clustering. The index can automatically choose input parameters of density clustering, and the effective clustering can be formed on different data sets. The optimized clustering method can be applied to the in-depth analysis and mining of traveler behavior trajectories. Experiments show that the Sage -Husa adaptive filtering algorithm proposed further improves the positioning accuracy of GPS, which is 17.34% and 15.24% higher eastward and northward, 14.25%, and 18.17% higher in 2D and 3D dimensions, respectively. The number of noise points is significantly reduced. At the same time, compared with the traditional validity index, the evaluation index based on the duty cycle proposed can optimize the input parameters and obtain better clustering results of traveler location information."
https://openalex.org/W4200525960,"Recent advances in understanding the capture of moving suspended particles in aquatic ecosystems have opened up new possibilities for predicting rates of suspension feeding, larval settlement, seagrass pollination and sediment removal. Drawing on results from both highly-resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and existing experimental data, we quantify the controlling influence of flow velocity, particle size and collector size on rates of contact between suspended particles and biological collectors over the parameter space characterising a diverse range of aquatic ecosystems. As distinct from assumptions in previous modeling studies, the functional relationships describing capture are highly variable. Contact rates can vary in opposing directions in response to changes in collector size, an organism's size, the size of particles being intercepted (related to diet in the case of suspension feeders), and the flow strength. Contact rates shift from decreasing to increasing with collector diameter when particles become relatively large and there is vortex shedding in the collector wake. And in some ranges of the ecologically relevant parameter space, contact rates do not increase strongly with velocity or particle size. The understanding of these complex dependencies allows us to reformulate some hypotheses of selection pressure on the physiology and ecology of aquatic organisms. We discuss the benefits and limitations of CFD tools in predicting rates of particle capture in aquatic ecosystems. Finally, across the complete parameter space relevant to real aquatic ecosystems, all quantitative estimates of particle capture from our model are provided here."
