https://openalex.org/W2154317235,"Freestanding single-crystal complete nanorings of zinc oxide were formed via a spontaneous self-coiling process during the growth of polar nanobelts. The nanoring appeared to be initiated by circular folding of a nanobelt, caused by long-range electrostatic interaction. Coaxial and uniradial loop-by-loop winding of the nanobelt formed a complete ring. Short-range chemical bonding among the loops resulted in a single-crystal structure. The self-coiling is likely to be driven by minimizing the energy contributed by polar charges, surface area, and elastic deformation. Zinc oxide nanorings formed by self-coiling of nanobelts may be useful for investigating polar surface-induced growth processes, fundamental physics phenomena, and nanoscale devices."
https://openalex.org/W2163667214,"Heavy smoke from forest fires in the Amazon was observed to reduce cloud droplet size and so delay the onset of precipitation from 1.5 kilometers above cloud base in pristine clouds to more than 5 kilometers in polluted clouds and more than 7 kilometers in pyro-clouds. Suppression of low-level rainout and aerosol washout allows transport of water and smoke to upper levels, where the clouds appear “smoking” as they detrain much of the pollution. Elevating the onset of precipitation allows invigoration of the updrafts, causing intense thunderstorms, large hail, and greater likelihood for overshooting cloud tops into the stratosphere. There, detrained pollutants and water vapor would have profound radiative impacts on the climate system. The invigorated storms release the latent heat higher in the atmosphere. This should substantially affect the regional and global circulation systems. Together, these processes affect the water cycle, the pollution burden of the atmosphere, and the dynamics of atmospheric circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2139025111,"The transcriptional regulatory networks that specify and maintain human tissue diversity are largely uncharted. To gain insight into this circuitry, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with promoter microarrays to identify systematically the genes occupied by the transcriptional regulators HNF1alpha, HNF4alpha, and HNF6, together with RNA polymerase II, in human liver and pancreatic islets. We identified tissue-specific regulatory circuits formed by HNF1alpha, HNF4alpha, and HNF6 with other transcription factors, revealing how these factors function as master regulators of hepatocyte and islet transcription. Our results suggest how misregulation of HNF4alpha can contribute to type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2158408478,"Urban air pollution and smoke from fires have been modeled to reduce cloud formation by absorbing sunlight, thereby cooling the surface and heating the atmosphere. Satellite data over the Amazon region during the biomass burning season showed that scattered cumulus cloud cover was reduced from 38%in clean conditions to 0%for heavy smoke (optical depth of 1.3). This response to the smoke radiative effect reverses the regional smoke instantaneous forcing of climate from –28 watts per square meter in cloud-free conditions to +8 watts per square meter once the reduction of cloud cover is accounted for."

The photon wave packets are emitted as a Gaussian beam with temporal profile and repetition rate controlled by external driving fields. Each generation attempt is inferred to succeed with a probability near unity, whereas the efficiency for creating an unpolarized photon in the total cavity output is 0.69 +/- 0.10, as limited by passive cavity losses. An average of 1.4 x 10(4) photons are produced by each trapped atom. These results constitute an important step in quantum information science, for example, toward the realization of distributed quantum networking."

https://openalex.org/W2045789066,"Legionella pneumophila, the bacterial agent of legionnaires' disease, replicates intracellularly within a specialized vacuole of mammalian and protozoan host cells. Little is known about the specialized vacuole except that the Icm/Dot type IV secretion system is essential for its formation and maintenance. The Legionella genome database contains two open reading frames encoding polypeptides (LepA and LepB) with predicted coiled-coil regions and weak homology to SNAREs; these are delivered to host cells by an Icm/Dot-dependent mechanism. Analysis of mutant strains suggests that the Lep proteins may enable the Legionella to commandeer a protozoan exocytic pathway for dissemination of the pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W2066815702,"Formins are a conserved class of proteins expressed in all eukaryotes, with known roles in generating cellular actin-based structures. The mammalian formin, FRLα, is enriched in hematopoietic cells and tissues, but its biochemical properties have not been characterized. We show that a construct composed of the C-terminal half of FRLα (FRLα-C) is a dimer and has multiple effects on muscle actin, including tight binding to actin filament sides, partial inhibition of barbed end elongation, inhibition of barbed end binding by capping protein, acceleration of polymerization from monomers, and actin filament severing. These multiple activities can be explained by a model in which FRLα-C binds filament sides but prefers the topology of sides at the barbed end (end-sides) to those within the filament. This preference allows FRLα-C to nucleate new filaments by side stabilization of dimers, processively advance with the elongating barbed end, block interaction between C-terminal tentacles of capping protein and filament end-sides, and sever filaments by preventing subunit re-association as filaments bend. Another formin, mDia1, does not reduce the barbed end elongation rate but does block capping protein, further supporting an end-side binding model for formins. Profilin partially relieves barbed end elongation inhibition by FRLα-C. When non-muscle actin is used, FRLα-C's effects are largely similar. FRLα-C's ability to sever filaments is the first such activity reported for any formin. Because we find that mDia1-C does not sever efficiently, severing may not be a property of all formins.

Non-muscle cells contain a variety of actin filament-based structures, including lamellipodia, ruffles, filopodia, microvilli, and sarcomeric contractile structures (including cytokinetic actin rings and stress fibers). Assembly mechanisms for these structures are being vigorously investigated. Spontaneous nucleation of actin monomers occurs very slowly (1Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and specific actin-associated proteins that promote rapid actin assembly are required for creating each actin-based structure. Arp2/3 1The abbreviations used are: Arp2/3, actin-related protein 2/3 complex; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol; FH1 and FH2, formin homology domains 1 and 2; FRL, formin-related gene in leukocytes; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mDia1, mammalian Diaphanous formin; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide. complex is a well characterized nucleation factor, forming networks of branched actin filaments that are present in lamellipodia and ruffles (2Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). In contrast, the proteins controlling assembly of many other actin-based structures have not been identified. Formins are a conserved class of actin-associated proteins that have been found in all eukaryotes examined and accelerate filament assembly independently of Arp2/3 complex (3Wallar B.J. Alberts A.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 435-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Two unifying structural features of formins are the Formin Homology 1 and 2 (FH1, FH2) domains, generally found in the C-terminal half of the protein. The FH1 domain contains proline-rich sequences capable of binding profilin and SH3 (Src homology 3) domain-containing proteins. The FH2 domain forms a multimeric structure (4Zigmond S.H. Evangelista M. Boone C. Yang C. Dar A.C. Sicheri F. Forkey J. Pring M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1820-1823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 5Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Budding yeast formins Bni1p and Bnr1p are required for the assembly of actin cables and cytokinetic actin rings in vivo (6Evangelista M. Pruyne D. Amberg D.C. Boone C. Bretscher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 7Sagot I. Rodal A.A. Moseley J. Goode B.L. Pellman D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Bni1p has barbed end nucleation activity in vitro, for which the FH2 domain is sufficient (7Sagot I. Rodal A.A. Moseley J. Goode B.L. Pellman D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 626-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 8Pruyne D. Evangelista M. Yang C. Bi E. Zigmond S. Bretscher A. Boone C. Science. 2002; 297: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Bni1p also slows barbed end elongation, while blocking complete barbed end elongation inhibition by capping protein (4Zigmond S.H. Evangelista M. Boone C. Yang C. Dar A.C. Sicheri F. Forkey J. Pring M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1820-1823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 5Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Mol. Biol.

Thus, although Bni1p slows elongation, it allows filaments to elongate in the presence of capping protein. Because capping protein usually caps newly assembled filaments within seconds, formins may allow prolonged filament elongation in cells. In fission yeast, Cdc15 is required for actin ring assembly in vivo. Cdc12 is a barbed end nucleator when bound to the actin monomer-binding protein profilin. In the absence of profilin, Cdc12 tightly caps barbed ends, allowing only pointed end elongation (10Kovar D.R. Kuhn J.R. Tichy A.L. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 875-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Mammals contain at least 15 formin isoforms. Few have been studied in detail, with mDia1 (also called DRF1, Dia1, or p140 Dia) being the most characterized to date. In cells, mDia1 localizes to cytokinetic actin rings, stress fibers, and lamellipodia (11Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Overexpression of constitutively active mDia1 constructs cause increased stress fiber formation (12Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 13Nakano K. Takaishi K. Kodama A. Mammoto A. Shiozaki H. Monden M. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2481-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In vitro, a construct of mDia1 containing FH1, FH2, and C-terminal domains is a potent actin filament nucleator (14Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), severalfold stronger than yeast formins. Similar to Bni1p, mDia1 protects barbed ends from capping protein (Ref. 5Moseley J.B. Sagot I. Manning A.L. Xu Y. Eck M.J. Pellman D. Goode B.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 896-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar and this study). Here we characterize the biochemical properties of the mammalian formin, FRL (formin-related gene in leukocytes), first identified from mouse spleen as the 1094-amino acid FRLα splice variant (15Yayoshi-Yamamoto S. Taniuchi I. Watanabe T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6872-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), although a number of other variants exist in the data base. We restrict our current study to the C-terminal region of FRLα (FRLα-C, amino acids 449–1094), which contains the complete FH1 and FH2 domains, as well as the full C terminus. In several assays, a similar construct of the FRLβ splice variant, differing in its C-terminal 30 amino acids (15Yayoshi-Yamamoto S. Taniuchi I. Watanabe T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6872-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), behaves similarly. FRLα-C is a dimer and has multiple effects on muscle actin. FRLα-C binds filaments tightly, with an apparent Kd < 0.1 μm. In addition, FRLα-C slows barbed end elongation with an IC50 of about 2 nm, demonstrating that it binds preferentially to filament barbed ends. This inhibition of elongation is only partial, and FRLα-C protects the barbed ends from complete elongation inhibition by capping protein. In pyrene-actin polymerization assays, FRLα-C accelerates actin polymerization in a concentration-dependent manner, with a persistent lag being observed even at micromolar FRLα-C concentrations. FRLα-C's polymerization activity is much weaker than that observed for mDia1 (14Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). FRLα-C also severs actin filaments, creating new barbed ends capable of elongation. Additional experiments with platelet actin demonstrate that FRLα-C has similar effects on non-muscle actin. We believe that polymerization acceleration by FRLα-C is due both to weak nucleation and filament severing. In addition, we postulate that FRLα-C's multiple effects on actin dynamics are due to its ability to interact with filament sides, with a preference for the side of the barbed end. DNA Constructs—Our construct of FRLα (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF215666) and FRLβ (GenBank™/EBI accession number AF006466) was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR from 300.19 murine pre-B lymphoma cell RNA. Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cell cultures with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was produced with oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The coding region fragments 449–1094 for FRLα (FRLα-C) and 423–1064 for FRLβ (FRLβ-C) were amplified with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR product was cloned into pGEX-KText vector (a gift from Jack Dixon). Protein Preparation and Purification—For FRLα-C and FRLβ-C, Rosetta DE3 Escherichia coli (Novagen) were transformed with expression construct and grown to A600 0.6–0.8 in TB (12 g/liter Tryptone, 24 g/liter yeast extract, 4.5 ml/liter glycerol, 14 g/liter dibasic potassium phosphate, and 2.6 g/liter monobasic potassium phosphate) with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. After reduction to 16 °C for 30 min, 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the cultures were grown overnight. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in EB (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 pill/50 ml Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and extracted by sonication. After ultracentrifugation, supernatant was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and washed with EB (without protease inhibitors but with 0.05% Polidocanol (Sigma P-9641)). Thrombin (Sigma T-4265) was added to a 50% slurry of the beads to 10 units/ml, and the suspension was mixed for 4 h. Cleaved protein was washed from the column, and thrombin was inactivated with 5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate/1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min, after which DTT was added to a concentration of 10 mm. FRLα-C was further enriched by SourceS15 chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Final protein pools were concentrated with Centricon P-20 (Amicon) and dialyzed in Na50MEPD (50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm DTT). Aliquots were stored at 4 °C or at -70 °C, with no resulting change in protein activity levels from either storage method. MDia1 748–1255 was expressed as lovingly described previously (14Li F. Higgs H.N. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1335-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In contrast to FRLα-C, mDia1 748–1255 lost 90% of its nucleation activity upon freezing, so was stored at 4 °C. For human profilin I, BL21(pLysS)DE3 E. coli (Novagen) were transformed with expression construct (gift from Thomas Pollard) and grown to A600 0.6–0.8 in LB (10 g/liter Tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 10 g/liter NaCl), with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and cultures were incubated an additional 4 h at 37 °C. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in EB and extracted by sonication. After ultracentrifugation supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter and loaded onto poly-l-proline (Sigma P-3886) linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with buffer 1 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), buffer 2 (buffer 1 with 3 m urea), and buffer 3 (buffer 1 with 8 m urea) sequentially. Buffer 3 eluate was dialyzed in DB (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% NaN3) overnight and then for an additional 2 h in fresh DB. Profilin was stored at 4 °C. Capping protein was a kind gift from David Kovar and Thomas Pollard. α-Actinin (AT01-A) and full-length muscle myosin (MY02-A) were purchased from Cytoskeleton. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified from acetone powder (16Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with pyrenyliodoacetamide (17Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Both unlabeled and labeled actin were gel filtered on S200 (18MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Cell. 1980; 20: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), which was crucial to obtain reproducible polymerization kinetics. Platelet actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton (APHL95). Before use, platelet actin was resuspended with water then centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a TLA-120 rotor (Beckman). Supernatant was loaded onto a SourceQ 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with G0 buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm CaCl2). Actin was eluted with a linear gradient from G0 to G300 (G0 plus 300 mm NaCl) and eluted as a single peak at 250 mm NaCl. ATP was added immediately to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Peak fractions were pooled, and actin was polymerized by addition of EGTA, MgCl2, and imidazole (pH 7.0) to 1, 1, and 10 mm, respectively, and incubated at room temperature for 4 h, then overnight at 4 °C. Polymerized actin was centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a TLA-120 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in G buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% NaN3), pushed through a 30-gauge needle, and dialyzed in G buffer for 48 h. After dialysis actin was centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 3 h at 4 °C in a TLA-120 rotor. The upper two-thirds of supernatant was removed and used for subsequent assays. An alternative purification process, in which actin was polymerized, depolymerized, then gel-filtered over a Superdex200 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) in G buffer, was also performed. Both purification procedures produced actin monomers with similar polymerization properties and removed gelsolin and Arp2/3 complex effectively. Protein Size Analysis Techniques—Gel filtration chromatography was conducted using a Superdex200 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) calibrated with both high and low molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences). A Stokes radius was calculated following the manufacturer's instructions. Analytical ultracentrifugation was conducted using a Beckman Proteomelab XL-A and an AN-60 rotor. For sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation, 0.7 μm FRLα-C in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm DTT was centrifuged at 30,000 rpm and 20 °C, and A220 was monitored every 2 min by continuous scan at 0.003-cm steps. Protein partial specific volume, buffer density, and buffer viscosity were determined using the Sednterp program (David Hayes and Tom Laue). Scans 1–200 were analyzed using Sedfit87 (www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com), resulting in one major species (>90%) centered at 4.2 S with a frictional ratio of 2.02. For sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation, various concentrations of FRLα-C (0.25, 0.333, 0.5, 0.667, 0.75, 1, and 1.25 μm) in the same buffer as for velocity centrifugation was centrifuged at 7,000, 10,000, and 14,000 rpm for 15, 10, and 10 h, respectively, at 20 °C. A220 at 0.001-cm steps were recorded every hour. Winmatch software (David Yphantis) was used to confirm equilibrium, and Winreedit software (D. Yphantis) was used to trim the data. Winnonln software (D. Yphantis) was used to fit the data. First, individual concentrations at individual speeds were analyzed, and minor speed-dependent and concentration-dependent changes in apparent molecular mass were detected. Next, data at multiple concentrations and speeds were fit to a single species, resulting in an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa (root mean square deviation = 0.00481). The systematic residual error pattern of this fit suggested non-ideality (19McRorie D.K. Voelker P.J. Self-associating Systems in the Analytical Ultracentrifuge. Beckman Instruments., Inc, Palo Alto, CA1993Google Scholar). Finally, the same multiple concentrations and speeds were fit to a monomer-dimer equilibrium, with a calculated monomer molecular mass of 71,335 Da. The resulting fit (root mean square deviation = 0.00441) had little systematic error and suggested an apparent Kd for dimerization of 0.1 μm. Actin Filament Binding Assays—Actin (10 μm) was polymerized for 2 h at 23 °C in polymerization buffer (G-Mg buffer (2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% NaN3) plus 1× KMEI (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA)), followed by addition of 10 μm phalloidin (Sigma P-2141). This actin stock was diluted to desired concentration in polymerization buffer in the absence or presence of putative binding proteins. Mixing was conducted in polycarbonate 7-× 20-mm centrifuge tubes (Beckman 343775) to a final volume of 200 μl. Filaments were pipetted using cut Pipetteman tips to minimize shearing. After 5 min at 23 °C, samples were centrifuged at 80,000 rpm for 20 min at 20 °C in a TLA-100.1 rotor (Beckman). 150 μl of supernatant was removed, lyophilized, and resuspended in 15 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After removal of the remaining supernatant, pellets were washed briefly with 200 μl of 1× KMEI, then resuspended in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Supernatants and pellets were analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Similar assays omitting phalloidin or adding 5 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, were also conducted. Actin Polymerization by Fluorescence Spectroscopy—A detailed procedure is described in a previous study (20Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Unlabeled and pyrene-labeled actin were mixed in G buffer to produce an actin stock of the desired pyrene-labeled actin percentage (5% unless otherwise stated). This stock was converted to Mg2+ salt by 2-min incubation at 23 °C in 1mm EGTA/0.1 mm MgCl2 immediately prior to polymerization. Polymerization was induced by addition of 10× KMEI (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) to a concentration of 1×, with the remaining volume made up by G-Mg. Added proteins were mixed together for 1 min prior to their rapid addition to actin to start the assay. Pyrene fluorescence (excitation 365 nm, emission 407 nm) was monitored in a PC1 spectrofluorometer (ISS, Champaign, IL). The time between mixing of final components and start of fluorometer data collection was measured for each assay and ranged between 10 and 15 s. Calculating Filament Concentration—Slopes of pyrene fluorescence from polymerization time courses were determined at the 50% point of polymerization with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Slopes were converted initially to filament concentration under the assumption of unrestricted ATP-actin monomer addition to barbed ends with a rate constant (K+) of 11.6 μm-1s-1 (1Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) according to the equation, F = S′/(M0.5 × K+), where F is filament concentration in micromolar, S′ is slope converted to micromolar/s, and M0.5 is micromolar monomer concentration at 50% polymerization. S′ is calculated by the equation S′ = (S × Mt)/(fmax - fmin), where S is raw slope in arbitrary units/s, Mt is micromolar concentration of total polymerizable monomer in micromolar, and fmax and fmin are fluorescence of fully polymerized and unpolymerized actin respectively, in arbitrary units. Because FRLα-C slows elongation rate by 80%, filament concentrations from assays conducted in the presence of FRLα-C were multiplied by 5. Barbed End Elongation Assays—Unlabeled actin (10 μm) was polymerized for at least 1 h at 23 °C, then diluted to 5 μm in the presence of 10 μm phalloidin and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 20 min in a TLA-120 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 3× polymerization buffer to 5 μm, then sheared by two passes through a 27-gauge needle. 37.5 μl of this mixture was aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes and allowed to re-anneal overnight at 23 °C. Polymerization buffer containing FRLα-C, capping protein, or mixtures of both (37.5-μl total) were added to filaments, mixed by gentle flicking, and incubated at 23 °C for 3 min. In competition assays between FRLα-C and capping protein, these two proteins were pre-mixed then added simultaneously to filaments. After 3 min at 23 °C, 75 μl of 2 μm monomers (5% pyrene, Mg2+-converted) and 8 μm profilin in G-Mg buffer were added to the filaments with a cut p200 tip, mixed by pipetting up and down three times, and placed into the fluorometer cuvette. Fluorescence (365/407 nm) was recorded for 180 s. Initial elongation velocity was obtained by linear fitting the initial 100 s of elongation. Final concentrations in the assay were 1.25 μm phalloidin-stabilized polymerized actin (0.1–0.15 nm barbed ends) and 1 μm monomer. In competition experiments between capping protein and formins, apparent Kd of formin binding to barbed end was determined by fitting elongation data to a competition binding model as described previously (20Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), assuming a Kd of 0.1 nm for capping protein binding to barbed ends. Re-annealing Assay—Actin (10 μm) was polymerized for 2 h at 23 °C in polymerization buffer, then diluted to 1 μm in polymerization buffer with 1.5 μm rhodamine-phalloidin (Sigma P-1951). This sample was pulled/pushed four times through a 1-ml syringe with a 27-gauge needle attached, then 10 μl was immediately aliquoted into tubes containing 10 μl of polymerization buffer with or without 200 nm FRLα-C or 200 nm capping protein. To stop the reactions, 1 ml of fluorescence buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm DTT, 0.5% methylcellulose, 3 mg/ml glucose, 18 μg/ml catalase, 100 μg/ml glucose oxidase) was added at various time points. Samples (2 μl) were adsorbed to 12-mm round glass coverslips previously coated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine. Filaments were pipetted with cut Pipetteman tips to reduce shearing. Samples were visualized on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using 100× 1.4 numerical aperture objective, and images were acquired with a Hamamatsu Orca II cooled charge-coupled device camera using Openlab software (Improvisions Inc., Boston, MA). Filament length was measured using Openlab software. At least two images were analyzed for every condition and time point, and all filaments with both ends discernable were measured on each image, resulting in 200–1400 individual filaments being measured for each condition depending on filament length. Severing Assay Using Fluorescence Microscopy—Actin (4 μm) was polymerized for at least 1 h at 23 °C in polymerization buffer. 10-μl aliquots from this stock were carefully pipetted into Eppendorf tubes and incubated 10 min at 23 °C. 10 μl of protein or buffer was added, mixed by gentle flicking, and incubated for the desired time at 23 °C. Polymerization buffer (20 μl) containing rhodamine-phalloidin (1 μm final) was added, and samples were immediately diluted 200-fold with fluorescence buffer. Samples (2 μl) were adsorbed to 12-mm round glass coverslips previously coated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine. Great care was taken during sample preparation to minimize manual severing. Filaments were only pipetted twice during the procedure: once after initial polymerization but before addition of FRLα-C or buffer and once to apply to coverslips. Also, we used cut Pipetteman tips to reduce shearing. Samples were visualized, and images were acquired as described above. Filament length was measured using Openlab software. At least five images were analyzed for every condition, and all filaments with both ends discernable were measured for each image, resulting in 200–1500 individual filaments being measured depending on filament length. Dual Color Filament Assay Using Fluorescence Microscopy—Actin (4 μm) was polymerized for at least 1 h at 23 °C in polymerization buffer. 10 μl of polymerized actin was incubated with 10 μl of 200 nm FRLα-C or buffer for 10 min at 23 °C then 20 μl of rhodamine-phalloidin was added to 1 μm. Samples were diluted 10-fold with 0.5 μm actin monomers and 0.5 μm Alexa 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes A-12379), incubated for 6 min at 23 °C, and diluted with 2 ml of fluorescence buffer. Samples (2 μl) were adsorbed to 12-mm round glass coverslips previously coated with 0.01% poly-l-lysine. Filaments were handled as described for the severing assay. Images were taken through both rhodamine and fluorescein filters. Filament length was measured using Openlab software. For each individual filament with both ends discernable, rhodamine- and Alexa 488-labeled segments were measured separately. At least two images were analyzed for each condition, totaling ∼150 filaments. Kinetic Severing Assay Using Time-lapse Microscopy—This method was adapted from previous studies (10Kovar D.R. Kuhn J.R. Tichy A.L. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 875-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 21Ichetovkin I. Han J. Pang K.M. Knecht D.A. Condeelis J.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Actin (4 μm) was polymerized for 2 h at 23 °C in polymerization buffer, then rhodamine-phalloidin was added to label 50% of polymerized actin. Filaments were diluted to 0.067 μm in modified fluorescence buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm DTT, 0.5% methyl-cellulose, 6 mg/ml glucose, 36 μg/ml catalase, 200 μg/ml glucose oxidase) plus 5 mg/ml BSA. Coverslips (30 × 22 mm) were mounted onto glass slides with two pieces of double stick tape, forming a perfusion chamber. NEM-treated myosin was diluted to 50 nm in high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 600 mm NaCl), and 70 μl was perfused into chambers for 1 min. Chambers were washed once with 70 μl of high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 600 mm NaCl, 1% BSA) and once with 70 μl of low salt buffer (same except with 150 mm NaCl). 70 μl of labeled actin filaments was perfused into chambers using a cut Pipetteman tip and incubated 5 min. Chambers were washed once with fluorescence buffer plus 5 mg/ml BSA to remove any unbound filaments. Time-lapse recording was initiated, and, after the first image was acquired, 70 μlof FRLα-C (diluted to 200 nm in modified fluorescence buffer with 5 mg/ml BSA) was perfused into chamber. Only filaments clearly breaking in the middle, resulting in two discernable pieces that could be tracked, were counted as severing events. Thirteen sequences for both control and FRLα-C were analyzed, and the sequences containing the highest and lowest number of severing events for each condition were excluded. Western Blotting of Actin Preparations—Gel-filtered actin from rabbit muscle, or platelet actin after initial resuspension or additional purification, was Western blotted at 2 μg on polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) against antibodies to human gelsolin (monoclonal GS-2C4 from Sigma), the ARPC1b subunit of Arp2/3 complex, human profilin I, human"
https://openalex.org/W2089310284,"We present the discovery of a circumstellar dust disk surrounding AU Microscopii (AU Mic, GJ 803, HD 197481). This young M star at 10 parsec has the same age and origin as beta Pictoris, another nearby star surrounded by a dust disk. The AU Mic disk is detected between 50 astronomical units (AU) and 210 AU radius, a region where dust lifetimes exceed the present stellar age. Thus, AU Mic is the nearest star where we directly observe the solid material required for planet formation. Because 85% of stars are M-type, the AU Mic disk provides new clues on how the majority of planetary systems might form and evolve."
https://openalex.org/W2012224269,"Death domain-associated protein (Daxx) is a multi-functional protein that modulates both apoptosis and transcription. Within the nucleus, Daxx is a component of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies (NBs) and interacts with a number of transcription factors, yet its precise role in transcription remains elusive. To further define the function of Daxx, we have isolated its interacting proteins in the nucleus using epitope-tagged affinity purification and identified X-linked mental retardation and α-thalassaemia syndrome protein (ATRX), a putative member of the SNF2 family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins that is mutated in several X-linked mental retardation disorders. We show that substantial amounts of endogenous Daxx and ATRX exist in a nuclear complex. Daxx binds to ATRX through its paired amphipathic alpha helices domains. ATRX has ATPase activity that is stimulated by mononucleosomes, and patient mutations in the ATPase domain attenuate this activity. ATRX strongly represses transcription when tethered to a promoter. Daxx does not affect the ATPase activity of ATRX, however, it alleviates its transcription repression activity. In addition, ATRX is found in the PML-NBs, and this localization is mediated by Daxx. These results show that the ATRX·Daxx complex is a novel ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, with ATRX being the core ATPase subunit and Daxx being the targeting subunit.

Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Daxx associates with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, an apical kinase of the JNK pathway, causing it to become active (2Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1860-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have revealed a role for Daxx in apoptosis induced by other stimuli, including transforming growth factor-β and interferons (3Perlman R. Schiemann W.P. Brooks M.W. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 4Gongora R. Stephan R.P. Zhang Z. Cooper M.D. Immunity. 2001; 14: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Despite these cytoplasmic interactions, Daxx is mainly found in the nucleus, and its cytosolic translocation appears to be regulated. For example, the translocation of Daxx to the cytoplasm can be induced by CD95 engagement in a heat shock protein 27-inhibitable manner (5Charette S.J. Landry J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 926: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, ASK1 can enhance the cytosolic localization of Daxx (6Ko Y.G. Kang Y.S. Park H. Seol W. Kim J. Kim T. Park H.S.

On the contrary, accumulation of Daxx in the nucleus is observed during the activation of splenocytes (7Zhong S. Salomoni P. Ronchetti S. Guo A. Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, Daxx is found in the promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) (8Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A.

The PML-NBs are dispersed in over 95% of cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by the PML-retinoid acid receptor fusion protein generated by a t(15,17) translocation. Treatment of APL patients with all-trans-retinoid acid or arsenic oxide induces degradation of the fusion protein, restoration of normal PML-NB appearance, and concomitant remission of the disease, implicating a critical function of the PML-NBs in protecting against APL pathogenesis (11Borden K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5259-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 12Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P.

In addition, the PML-NBs are disrupted by various viral proteins and increase in both size and number in response to anti-viral cytokine interferons that up-regulate PML-NB components, suggesting a role for the PML-NBs in anti-viral responses (14Regad T. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7274-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells deficient in PML are resistant to a wide range of apoptotic stimuli, including UV radiation and engagement of CD95 (15Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and Daxx appears to be able to regulate apoptosis from the PML-NBs (7Zhong S. Salomoni P. Ronchetti S. Guo A. Ruggero D. Pandolfi P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 8Torii S. Egan D.A. Evans R.A. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). How the PML-NBs function in tumor suppression, anti-viral responses, and apoptosis is not well defined. Several cellular proteins have been found in the PMLNBs in addition to PML and Daxx, including p53, pRb, Sp100, SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier), CBP, HAUSP, and BLM, and a role for the PML-NBs in transcription has been proposed (16Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, a better understanding of PML-NB function requires the identification of additional key components that associate with these structures. Daxx has been shown to be a transcription regulatory protein and to associate with several sequence-specific transcription factors, such as Pax3, Pax5, ETS1, and the glucocorticoid receptor (17Hollenbach A.D. Sublett J.E. McPherson C.J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 18Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2003; 278: 15958-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Daxx regulates transcription is not well understood, but it is conceivable that Daxx may associate with chromatin-remodeling complexes. Indeed, the association of Daxx with histone deacetylase chromatin remodeling complexes has been reported (18Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 22Hollenbach A.D. McPherson C.J. Mientjes E.J. Iyengar R. Grosveld G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether Daxx also engages the other major class of chromatin remodeling molecules, the ATP-dependent remodeling complexes. To further define the function of Daxx, we have devised a convenient affinity purification strategy to isolate Daxx-associated proteins. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of ATRX as a Daxx-interacting protein. ATRX is a large protein of ∼280 kDa that contains a putative ATPase/helicase domain homologous to that found in members of the SNF2 family of chromatin-remodeling proteins. In addition, it also contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) zinc finger domain, which is most similar to the DNA methyltransferase 3 family of proteins. Mutations in the X-linked ATRX gene are most commonly located within the putative ATPase/helicase domain and the PHD motif causing a severe mental retardation syndrome that is associated with urogenital abnormalities, facial dysmorphisms, and frequently α-thalassaemia (the ATR-X syndrome) (23Gibbons R.J. Picketts D.J. Villard L. Higgs D.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 24Picketts D.J. Higgs D.R. Bachoo S. Blake D.J. Quarrell O.W. Gibbons R.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1899-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 25Gibbons R.J. Bachoo S. Picketts D.J. Aftimos S. Asenbauer B. Bergoffen J. Berry S.A. Dahl N. Fryer A. Keppler K.

Despite its similarity to chromatin-remodeling proteins, the precise function of ATRX remains largely unknown. We show that endogenous Daxx and ATRX are present in a nuclear complex. Daxx interacts with ATRX through its NH2-terminal paired amphipathic alpha helices (PAH) domains. In addition, we demonstrate that ATRX possesses mononucleosome-stimulated ATPase activity, and patient mutations attenuate this activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ATRX is localized to the PML-NBs. Daxx recruits ATRX to the PML-NBs and inhibits ATRX-mediated transcription regulation. These results suggest that the ATRX·Daxx complex is a novel chromatin remodeling complex and that Daxx may regulate ATRX activity by altering its cellular localization. The localization of ATRX to the PML-NBs also supports the notion that the PML-NBs regulate diverse cellular processes by modulating transcription. Reagents—The following reagents were obtained from the indicated sources: monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (M2) and HA (HA-7) and their agarose affinity gels and corresponding peptides (Sigma); anti-Daxx (M-112), anti-PML (PG-M3), and anti-ATRX (H-300) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); protein A- and G-Sepharose beads, [γ-33P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and DNase I (10 units/μl, fast protein liquid chromatography-pure) (Amersham Pharmacia); protease inhibitors (CompleteMini, EDTA-free) and human interferon-γ (Roche Applied Science). The affinity-purified sheep anti-ATRX (Fxnp5) was previously described (26Berube N.G. Smeenk C.A. Picketts D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Expression Plasmids—For expression in mammalian cells, full-length Daxx protein and the deletion mutants of Daxx and ATRX were fused to an NH2-terminal FLAG tag in pRK5 (27Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). pGal, expressing the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (amino acids 1-148), and pGal-ATRX, expressing a fusion of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain of ATRX, were also made in pRK5. The ATRX-GFP fusion plasmids were made in either pEGFP-C2 (for the full-length protein) or pEGFP-C1 (for deletion mutants) (Clontech), whereas RFP-PML was made in pdsRed-N1 (Clontech). For expression in insect cells, human ATRX and ISWI proteins SNF2H and SNF2L were cloned into pBacPAK (Clontech) with either a COOH-terminal HA tag (for ATRX) or an NH2-terminal FLAG tag (for SNF2H and SNF2L). The ATRX point mutations were made using the XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction and verified by DNA sequencing. The following mutations were made: PHD, the common R246C mutation located in the PHD zinc finger domain; PED3 and PED23, the Y2084H and D2035V mutations in the putative ATPase/helicase domain which have been previously described (23Gibbons R.J. Picketts D.J. Villard L. Higgs D.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar); Mu, a K1600R mutation in the conserved ATP binding site. Biochemical Identification of Daxx-binding Proteins—To prepare nuclear extracts, human HeLa S3 cells from 10-liter suspension culture (obtained from the National Cell Culture Center) were lysed in five cell volumes of buffer A (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were further disrupted by Dounce homogenization, and the nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The nuclei were suspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA), and the soluble fraction was diluted 1:1 with a low salt buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) to yield nuclear extracts. To generate recombinant FLAG-Daxx protein in mammalian cells, FLAG-Daxx/pRK5 or the control vector FLAG/pRK5 was transfected into HeLa cells seeded in thirteen 10-cm plates with 5 μg of DNA/plate by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of IP-lysis buffer (27Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated with M2-agarose beads for 4 h. After extensive washing, the beads were incubated overnight with 10 mg of HeLa nuclear extracts. The beads were washed four times with IP-lysis buffer and three times with buffer C (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA). The bound proteins were eluted with 100 μl of buffer C containing 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide for 1 h. The eluted proteins were stored at -80 °C. An aliquot of eluted proteins was resolved on SDS-PAGE gel, and Daxx-associated proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Gel Filtration Chromatography and Co-immunoprecipitation—Ten milligrams of HeLa S3 nuclear extract were separated on a Superose 6 column driven by an Amersham Biosciences AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system. Proteins in various fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To detect the interaction between endogenous ATRX and Daxx, about 2 × 107 HEK293T cells were lysed in IP-lysis buffer. Cell extracts were incubated with the indicated antibodies, followed by incubation with protein A beads. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses. To map the interaction domain on Daxx, FLAG-tagged wild-type Daxx and various mutant Daxx proteins were expressed in 293T cells. The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with M2 beads and endogenous ATRX protein bound to the beads was detected by immunoblotting. Reciprocally, various FLAG-tagged ATRX constructs were expressed in 293T cells, and their ability to associate with endogenous Daxx was examined by immunoprecipitation assays. Expression and Purification of Recombinant ATRX, SNF2H, and SNF2L—The pBacPak expression plasmids were co-transfected with BacPAK6 viral DNA into insect Sf21 cells (Clontech) to generate recombinant baculoviruses according to the manufacturer's instruction. Following several rounds of amplification, the recombinant virus was used to infect insect Sf21 cells. Forty-eight hours post-infection, the cells were harvested and recombinant proteins were purified as previously described with modifications (28Fyodorov D.V. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6344-6353Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cell pellet was suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 20% of glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) with or without DNase I (100 units/ml) and homogenized thoroughly in a Dounce homogenizer (firm pestle). All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The recombinant proteins in the supernatant were affinity-purified using either Fxnp5 plus protein G-Sepharose beads or anti-HA agarose (for ATRX), or with anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads (for SNFH and SNF2L proteins). After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with either 200 μg/ml HA or FLAG peptide or with 100 mm glycine (pH 3.2). The protein was frozen in dry ice in small aliquots (20-50 μl) and stored at -80 °C. ATPase Assay—The ATPase activities of recombinant human ATRX, SNF2H, and SNF2L were measured as previously described with modifications (29Tsukiyama T. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant proteins (5-200 ng) were incubated with 0.25 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), plus 2.94 nm pUC19 plasmid DNA (100 ng) or 0.83 pmol (250 ng) of mononucleosomes where indicated, in a total volume of 20 μl of ATPase assay buffer (25 mm HEPES-KCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm unlabeled ATP, and 0.005% Nonidet P-40). The mixture was stopped after incubation at 27 °C for 20 min by adding 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 8.0). One microliter of the reaction mixture was separated by thin layer chromatography with a poly(ethyleneimine)-cellulose plate (J.T. Baker) in 0.5 m LiCl and 1 m acetic acid. The ratio of free phosphate to ATP was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Immunofluorescence—HEK293T or HeLa cells were seeded on cover slips placed in 24-well plates. When indicated, cells were treated with interferon-γ at 5 ng/ml concentration for 24 h. Transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min on ice. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with anti-Daxx (M-112), anti-PML (PG-M3), or anti-ATRX (H-300), as indicated, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fluorescence signals were analyzed on a Bio-Rad 1024-ES confocal laser-scanning microscope unless otherwise indicated. Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected on the second day by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, with 0.4 μg of 5xGal-TK-luciferase reporter gene plasmid (30Zhang Y. Sun Z.W. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Mol.

The total amount of DNA was made constant by adding the pRK5 vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity with a firefly luciferase system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of the activities of the co-transfected β-galactosidase. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments done in duplicate. Identification of ATRX as a Novel Daxx-interacting Protein—To identify Daxx-associated proteins, we expressed a FLAG-tagged Daxx protein (FLAG-Daxx) in HeLa cells and affinity-purified the protein using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 beads. The immobilized FLAG-Daxx was then incubated with a large quantity of HeLa nuclear extract to identify its interacting proteins. This approach has two major advantages. First, the bait protein is made in mammalian cells and is therefore likely to have the correct post-translational modification. Second, it avoids the lengthy (and sometimes unachievable) process of establishing stable transfectants. As shown in Fig. 1A, a protein around 300 kDa in size in the HeLa nuclear extract specifically associated with the FLAG-Daxx beads but not the control beads. This protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry, and thirteen peptide sequences were obtained, all of which matched the sequence of ATRX (Fig. 1A). To confirm the Daxx·ATRX interaction in another cell line as well as the interaction between the endogenous proteins, we performed immunoprecipitation assays using extracts of human 293T cells. Endogenous Daxx was immunoprecipitated, and ATRX was readily detected by Western blot analysis in the anti-Daxx immunoprecipitates but not in control immunoprecipitates with an unrelated antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 2 versus 1). Reciprocally, Daxx was present in the anti-ATRX immunoprecipitates (lane 3). These assays also revealed that a significant portion of endogenous Daxx and ATRX are in the same complex (data not shown). To further characterize the Daxx·ATRX complex, we fractionated HeLa cell nuclear extracts using a gel filtration column and analyzed fractions from the column by Western blot analysis with anti-ATRX and anti-Daxx antibodies. The Daxx and ATRX proteins were co-eluted in a complex of ∼350 kDa, suggesting a stoichiometric ratio of Daxx and ATRX in the complex. Recently, ATRX was shown to be present in a larger (1 MDa) complex that contained six polypeptides, including Daxx (31Xue Y. Gibbons R. Yan Z. Yang D. McDowell T.L. Sechi S. Qin J. Zhou S. Higgs D. Wang W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10635-10640Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The differences we observed are likely attributable to the sensitivity of the complex to differing salt concentrations used for purification. Daxx Associates with ATRX via its NH2-terminal PAH Domains—To delineate the region of Daxx that mediates its interaction with ATRX, we constructed various deletion mutants of Daxx, each tagged with an NH2-terminal FLAG epitope (Fig. 2A). The FLAG-Daxx proteins were transiently expressed in 293T cells and precipitated with anti-FLAG M2 beads, and the presence of endogenous ATRX in the immunoprecipitates was examined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2B, all Daxx mutants that contained the NH2-terminal 160 amino acids, including the first paired amphipathic helix (PAH), were able to associate with ATRX (lanes 2-6), albeit the interaction was stronger if the second PAH domain was also present (amino acids 1-260, lanes 2-5 versus lane 6). In contrast, all of the mutations that were missing the first PAH domain failed to bind to ATRX (lanes 7-9). Together, these results demonstrate that the NH2-terminal PAH region of Daxx mediates its interaction with ATRX. Notably, this is the first indication of a function for the PAH domains, as all of the Daxx-interacting proteins previously reported in the literature associate with the COOH region of Daxx (1Yang X.

Mapping the Daxx-interacting Region of ATRX—To determine the Daxx-interacting domain of ATRX, we generated various FLAG-tagged ATRX deletion mutants (Fig. 3A). Our initial analysis demonstrated that both halves of the ATRX protein can interact with Daxx, indicating that ATRX may contain two distinct Daxx-interacting domains (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 7). Further analysis revealed that all of the ATRX fragments containing amino acids 1189-1326 interacted well with Daxx, whereas the COOH fragments of ATRX that were missing these amino acids failed to do so (lanes 11-14). Thus, amino acids 1189-1326 constitute a Daxx-interacting domain. In addition, the region between amino acids 321 and 865 may contain a second Daxx-interacting domain (lanes 4 and 9). However, the first domain bound to Daxx more strongly than the second one and therefore may be the domain mainly responsible for the ATRX·Daxx interaction (lanes 11, 12, and 14 versus lane 9). In contrast, two previously identified domains of ATRX, the NH2-terminal PHD domain and the COOH-terminal ATPase/helicase domains, are not required for the interaction with Daxx (Fig. 3B). ATRX Possesses ATPase Activity That Is Stimulated by Nucleosomes—The ATPase/helicase domain of ATRX shares significant homology with those found in members of the SNF2 family of chromatin-remodeling proteins. We therefore sought to determine whether the ATRX protein had ATPase activity. We expressed recombinant ATRX and, for comparison, recombinant mammalian ISWI proteins-SNF2H and SNF2L-in insect cells using baculovirus expression plasmids. The recombinant ATRX protein was purified by an anti-HA affinity column and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and immunoblotting with either anti-ATRX or anti-HA antibody (Fig. 4A, lanes 3, 6, and 9). Similarly, the recombinant SNF2H and SNF2L proteins containing an NH2-terminal FLAG tag were expressed and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C, ATRX hydrolyzed ATP in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 10-13 versus 1). To determine the relative specific activities of the different proteins, we plotted the dose-dependent ATPase activities of the purified proteins from three independent preparations and found that the ability of ATRX to hydrolyze [γ-33P]ATP, based on the molar concentration of protein, was only slightly less than that of SNF2H but significantly higher than the ATPase activity of SNF2L (Fig. 4D). It is clear that the observed ATPase activity originated from the ATRX protein as opposed to one or more contaminant proteins in the preparation, because the activity was either diminished or completely impaired when ATRX mutations were introduced (see below). Previous studies have shown that the ATPase activity of both the SNF/SWI and the ISWI subfamilies of chromatin remodeling molecules is stimulated by DNA. However, the responses of these molecules to naked and mononucleosomal DNA are different. SNF/SWI proteins are stimulated equally well by both types of DNA, whereas ISWI proteins are stimulated only by nucleosomes (32Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). To characterize the effects of these DNA substrates on the ATPase activity of ATRX, we examined whether naked DNA or mononucleosomes could stimulate the ATPase activity of ATRX. The ATPase activity of ATRX approximately doubled in response to mononucleosomes but was not stimulated by plasmid DNA (Fig. 5A, lanes 10, 11 versus 9). The effect of the mononucleosomes, albeit moderate, was very reproducible. In addition, the response of ATRX alone was slightly different than the activity of the ATRX·Daxx complex, which could be stimulated equally well by both naked DNA and chroma"

The reaction center of PSII is made up of two membrane-spanning polypeptides (D1 and D2) that bear the redox cofactors involved in the main electron transfer route. Absorption of a photon results in a charge separation between a chlorophyll molecule (P680), and a pheophytin molecule. The pheophytin anion transfers the electron to a quinone, QA, and P680+ is reduced by a tyrosine residue, TyrZ, that in turn is reduced by the Mn4 cluster. During the enzyme cycle, the oxidizing side of PSII goes through five different redox states that are denoted Sn, n varying from 0 to 4. Oxygen is released during the S3 to S0 transition in which S4 is a transient state (reviewed in Refs. 1Debus R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Other suggested roles for Ca2+ include: 1) controlling substrate and Cl– access to the active site (22Rutherford A.W. Trends Biochem.

From the strontium-EXAFS done on Sr2+-reconstituted Ca2+-depleted PSII, a manganese-strontium distance of 3.4 Å has been proposed (25Cinco R.M. Robblee J.H. Rompel A. Fernandez C. Yachandra V.K. Sauer K. Klein M.P. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 8248-8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (a value confirmed by calcium-EXAFS done on normal PSII sample (Ref. 26Cinco R.M. Holman K.L.M.

In addition, it was found by mass spectrometry experiments that substitution of Ca2+ by Sr2+ accelerated the slow rate of H 182O exchange by a factor of 3–4 in the S1-, S2-, and S3-states (31Hendry G. Wydrzynski T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6209-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).These experiments were all performed after appropriate biochemical treatments leading to Ca2+/Sr2+ exchange. In general, these treatments consist of washing PSII in high salt buffers in the light (at pH 6.5, Ca2+/Sr2+ exchange occurred in the S3-state) (7Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3476-3483Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 16Boussac A. Zimmermann J.-L. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8984-8989Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) or by treatment at low pHs (≤3) (32Kodera Y. Hara H. Astashkin A.V. Kawamori A. Ono T.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 43-51Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Doubts have been raised in the past concerning potential secondary effects of the biochemical treatments used, and it has been suggested that some of the phenomena associated with Ca2+ depletion, and by implication Sr2+ replacement, may be because of secondary structural effects (1Debus R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 269-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 5Yocun C.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 1-15Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 10Boussac A.

Although good arguments have been made to counter these doubts (1Debus R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 269-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 10Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 32: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 35Han C.-H. Katoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 585-593Google Scholar), these have been revived by related work focused on removal and exchange of chloride ions where secondary biochemical effects have been specifically invoked (36Olesen K. Andreasson L.-E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2025-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The procedures to remove Ca2+ always result in an inhibition (i.e. the release of the Mn4 cluster) of a small proportion of PSII centers (37Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 195-201Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 38Shen J.-R. Katoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1991; 32: 439-446Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, Sr2+ reconstitution is not necessarily 100% efficient and the Sr2+-reconstituted PSII is very often an unstable material. All of these effects rendered the previous Sr2+-reconstituted PSII an heterogeneous enzyme. These have made imperative the development of a new fully stable and fully active strontium-PSII.The focus of PSII research recently has turned to cyanobacterial PSII because of 1) the availability of mutants (39Diner B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1503: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 40Debus R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1503: 164-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 41Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and 2) a move to study thermophilic species of cyanobacteria that have provided excellent spectroscopic material (27Boussac A. Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13788-13799Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 42Noguchi T. Sugiura M.

Acta. 1996; 1274: 1-8Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and have provided the first x-ray crystallographic models of PSII (46Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 47Kamiya N. Shen J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The role of Ca2+ in cyanobacterial PSII is more poorly understood than in plant systems. From a few studies, a less specific ion requirement has been reported (33Pauly S. Schloddler E. Wit H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1099: 203-210Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 48Becker D.W. Brand J.J. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 552-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the biochemical procedures developed for Ca2+ ion removal in plants are inappropriate for cyanobacterial systems, because of differences in the extrinsic polypeptides present in cyanobacteria compared with plants (e.g. Refs. 3Barber J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar and 49Enami I. Iwai M. Akiyama A. Suzuki T. Okumura A. Katoh T. Tada O. Ohta H.S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 820-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The measurement of calcium stoichiometries in PSII has proved particularly problematic. Because of the ubiquitous nature of Ca2+, background levels are often close to the concentration found in the biological samples. Many years of wrangling went on before the field stopped arguing over the stoichiometry in plant material (10Boussac A. Rutherford A.W. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 32: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 11Adelroth P. Lindberg K. Andréasson L.-E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9021-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35Han C.-H. Katoh S. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 585-593Google Scholar). To measure the stoichiometry of calcium in PSII of cyanobacteria, we wished to avoid the difficulties encountered in plant PSII. One approach that seemed worth trying was the biosynthetic replacement of Ca2+ with Sr2+ by growing the cyanobacterial cells in Sr2+-containing media. This approach promised the benefit of providing material not only for the measurement of strontium (and hence calcium) stoichiometries, but also for enzymological and spectroscopic studies in cyanobacteria without the necessity of developing the exchange procedures in vitro and without the risk of preparation artifacts.Here we present (a) the results of this biosynthetic replacement study using Thermosynechococcus elongatus, (b) a procedure for the isolation of the Sr2+-containing enzyme, and (c) the results of kinetics and enzymological studies.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of “Thylakoids” and PSII Core Complexes—T. elongatus (43-H strain) (41Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) were grown in 3-liter Erlenmeyer flasks (1500-ml culture) in a rotary shaker (120 rpm) at 45 °C under continuous illumination from fluorescent white lamps (≈80 μmol of photons·m–2·s–1). The cells were grown in a DTN medium (41Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) containing either 0.8 mm CaCl2 or 0.8 mm SrCl2 in an CO2-enriched atmosphere. Cells were grown until they reached an optical density (OD) close to 1.0 at 800 nm. After harvesting by centrifugation, the cells were washed once with buffer 1 (40 mm MES, pH 6.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1.2 m betaine) and resuspended in the same buffer, with 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm aminocaproic acid, and 50 μg·ml–1 DNase I added, to a chlorophyll concentration of ≈1.5 mg·ml–1. The cells were ruptured with a French press (≈700 p.s.i.). Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (1,000 × g, 5 min). Thylakoids were pelleted by centrifugation at 180,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C and washed twice with buffer 1. Thylakoids were finally resuspended in buffer 1 and stored in liquid N2 at a Chl concentration of 1 mg·ml–1 before use. Thylakoids obtained from cells grown in the presence of either Ca2+ or Sr2+ will be noted as Ca-thylakoids or Srthylakoids, respectively.PSII were purified from freshly prepared thylakoids essentially as described previously (41Sugiura M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 1219-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications. Thylakoids (1 mg·ml–1, final concentration) were treated with 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (β-DM, Biomol, Germany) in buffer 1 supplemented with 100 mm NaCl. After ≈1 min of stirring in the dark at 4 °C the suspension was centrifuged (10 min, 170,000 × g) to remove the non-solubilized material. Then, the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of Probond resin (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer 1. The resulting slurry was transferred to an empty column. After sedimentation of the resin inside the column, the supernatant was removed. The resin was washed with buffer 2 (40 mm MES, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, 0.03% (w/v) β-DM, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1.2 m betaine, pH 6.5) until the OD value of the eluate at ≈670 nm decreased below 0.05. Then, PSII core complexes were eluted with buffer 3 (150 mm MES, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm CaCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 0.1% (w/v) β-DM, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1.2 m betaine, the pH was adjusted to 6.5 by adding concentrated HCl). The eluate was then either precipitated with buffer 1 with 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol-8000 added by centrifugation (10 min, 170,000 × g) or concentrated and washed using centrifugal filter devices (Ultrafree-15, Millipore). PSII core complexes were finally resuspended in buffer 1 at a Chl concentration of 1–1.5 mg·ml–1 and store in liquid N2 before to be used. The estimate of Chl concentration was done by solubilizing the biological material in methanol and by using an extinction coefficient equal to 79.95 mg–1·ml·cm–1 at 665 nm (51Porra R.J. Scheer H. The Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 31-57Google Scholar). PSII core complexes purified from cells grown in the presence of either Ca2+ or Sr2+ will be noted calcium-PSII or strontium-PSII, respectively.Manganese Depletion—Manganese depletion of PSII was done by a washing of the sample in 1.2 m Tris, pH 9.2, in room light at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation (3 h, 170,000 × g), the pellet was submitted to a second washing in 1 m CaCl2 for 30 min at 4 °C. PSII depleted of the manganese cluster and of the three extrinsic proteins was then pelleted by centrifugation (3 h, 170,000 × g) and resuspended in buffer 1.Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Calcium-PSII, strontium-PSII, and manganese-depleted PSII were mixed with 30 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 30 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% lauryl sulfate at a Chl concentration of 0.5 mg·ml–1. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and then applied to a 16–22% gradient of SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5 m urea (52Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 1233-1239Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was done under a current of 10 mA. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue as described previously (52Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1988; 29: 1233-1239Google Scholar).Oxygen Evolution Measurements—Oxygen evolution under continuous light was measured at 25 °C by polarography using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech) with saturating white light. Oxygen evolution of PSII core complexes (5 μg of Chl·ml–1) was measured in buffer 1 in the presence of 0.5 mm DCBQ (2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone, dissolved in Me2SO) or 0.5 mm PPBQ (phenyl-p-benzoquinone dissolved in Me2SO) as electron acceptors. For measurements at various pH values, the following buffers were used: MES, pH 5.5, 6.0, and 6.5; HEPES, pH 7.0 and 7.5; CHES, pH 8.0 and 8.5.Oxygen evolution under flashing light was measured with a laboratory-made rate electrode similar to that already described (53Miyao M. Murata N. Lavorel J. Maison B. Boussac A. Etienne A.-L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 890: 151-159Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cathylakoids or Sr-thylakoids were used at 1 mg·ml–1 without an added electron acceptor. Illumination was done with a xenon flash. The power of the xenon flash was adjusted so that the light intensity was saturating (i.e. the miss parameter was minimum). Measurements were done at room temperature (20–25 °C). The flash-induced oxygen evolution patterns reported here were obtained as follows; the direct current was recorded with a numerical oscilloscope (see the inset to Fig. 8), and then the derivative versus time was computed mathematically. The derivative step (dt) used was dt = 10 ms for Ca-thylakoids and dt = 20 ms for Sr-thylakoids because the oxygen release was slower in Sr-thylakoids than in Ca-thylakoids. Then, the amplitude of the derivative signal was plotted versus the flash number. Analysis of the flash-induced oxygen evolution patterns was done using the classic equations listed below assuming the miss (α) and double hit (β) parameters to be equal on all flashes.[O2]n=(1−α)[S3]n−1+β[S2]n−1(Eq. 1) [O2]n is the amount of O2 evolved after flash n, and [S3]n–1 and [S2]n–1 are the amount of S3 and S2, respectively, before flash n.[Si]n=(1−α−β)[Si−1]n−1+β[Si−2]n−1+α[Si]n−1(Eq. 2) A scaling factor multiplying the experimental data was introduced into the fitting procedure so that the amount of O2 evolved upon each flash corresponded to the percentage of centers by which it was produced.Continuous Wave-EPR Measurements—CW-EPR spectra were recorded using a standard ER 4102 (Bruker) X-band resonator with a Bruker ESP300 X-band spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments cryostat (ESR 900). Continuous illumination of the Sr-thylakoid samples ([Chl] ≈ 3–4mg·ml–1) was done with an 800-W tungsten lamp, light from which was filtered through water and IR filters, in a nonsilvered Dewar flask filled with ethanol cooled to 198 K with solid CO2. Flash illumination at room temperature was provided by a Nd:YAG laser (532 nm, 550 mJ, 8 ns Spectra Physics GCR-230-10). For measurements of the S2-multiline signal after a given number of flashes, strontium-PSII samples at 1 mg·ml–1 were loa"

The lack of a useful system for evaluating the viral replication not only hampers the understanding of the life cycle of this virus but also prevents the development of adequate treatment for HCV infection. In an important development, a subgenomic HCV RNA replicon system containing HCV internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) driving a neomycin resistance (neor) gene and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES driving HCV non-structural (NS) proteins NS3-NS5B has been developed (9Lohmann V.

Another mutant construct, pSGR-JFH1/H2476L, was also used that contains a point mutation A to T at nucleotide position 6113 to change His to Leu at amino acid position 2476 in the NS5B region (12Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Furusaka A. Tokushige K. Mizokami M. Wakita T. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1808-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). RNA Synthesis—The XbaI-digested replicon constructs were further treated with mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to remove four nucleotides and leave the correct 3′ end of the HCV cDNA. Digested plasmid DNAs were purified and used as templates for in vitro RNA synthesis using the MEGAscript™ T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Synthesized HCV subgenomic RNA was treated with DNase I (RQ1™ RNase-free DNase, Promega, Madison, WI) followed by acidphenol extraction to remove any remaining template DNA. RNA Transfection—Synthesized replicon RNA (0.1-100 ng) was adjusted to 10 μg with cellular RNA isolated from untransfected cells and transfected into Huh7 as described previously (12Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Furusaka A. Tokushige K. Mizokami M. Wakita T. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1808-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). HepG2 and IMY-N9 cells were also transfected by electroporation using the following procedures. Between 90 ng and 9 μg of synthesized replicon RNA were adjusted to 30 μg with untransfected cellular RNA, and 30 μg of synthesized or adjusted RNAs were transfected into HepG2 or IMY-N9 cells. Trypsinized cells were washed with Opti-MEM I™ reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) and resuspended with Cytomix buffer at 2.3 × 107 cells/ml for HepG2 cells or at 4.5 × 107 cells/ml for IMY-N9 cells. RNA (30 μg) was mixed with 400 μl of the cell suspensions, transferred to an electroporation cuvette (Precision Universal Cuvettes, Thermo Hybrid, Middlesex, UK), and pulsed at 260 V and 950 microfarads with the Gene Pulser II™ apparatus (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were immediately transferred to 24 ml of MEM-10 or DMEM-10 and divided among three culture dishes (10 cm, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) coated with collagen (Cellgen, Koken Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). G418 (0.8-1.0 mg/ml) (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was added to the culture medium at 16-24 h after transfection, and culture medium supplemented with G418 was replaced twice a week. Three weeks after transfection, cells were fixed with buffered formalin and stained with crystal violet. Analysis of G418-resistant Cells—G418-resistant colonies were collected and used for further analysis as cell pellets; sparsely grown colonies were independently isolated using a cloning cylinder (Asahi Techno Glass Co., Tokyo, Japan) and amplified until they were 80-90% confluent in 10-cm culture dishes for use in nucleic acid and protein analyses. Total RNA and genomic DNA were simultaneously isolated from amplified clones using the ISOGEN™ reagent (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). Another portion of the cell pellet was dissolved in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 0.1% SDS for protein analysis. Northern Blot Analysis—Isolated RNA aliquots (6 or 4 μg) were separated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences), and immobilized by Stratalinker™ UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization was carried out with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probe using Rapid-Hyb™ buffer (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA probes were synthesized from neor and EMCV IRES genes using the Megaprime™ DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA probe of β-actin was also synthesized as a control. Genomic DNA PCR—To detect neor gene integration into the genomic DNA, isolated cellular genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using neor gene-specific primers (NEO-S3, 5′-AACAAGATGGATTGCACGCA-3′; NEO-R, 5′-CGTCAAGAAGGCGATAGAAG-3′). To confirm the integrity of the genomic DNAs isolated from replicon cells, the β-globin gene was also amplified using primers GH-20 (5′-GAAGAGCCAAGGACAGGTAC-3′) and GH-21 (5′-GGAAAATAGACCAATAGGCAG-3′) as described previously (16Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13369) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis of HCV Proteins—The protein samples were separated on 7.5-15% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Biocraft, Tokyo, Japan) and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon™, Millipore). Transferred proteins were incubated with blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk (Snow Brand, Sapporo, Japan) in phosphate-buffered saline. Mouse polyclonal antibody specific for NS5A protein was produced by DNA immunization with the JFH-1 NS5A-expressing construct according to the method described previously (17Zhao Z. Wakita T. Yasui K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4248-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HCV proteins were detected using anti-NS5A mouse polyclonal antibody and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Detection was carried out with a chemiluminescence system (ECL Plus™, Amersham Biosciences) using JFH-1 replicon replicating in Huh7 cells as positive controls (Ref. 12Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M.

Miyamoto, T. Kato, T. Date, and T. Wakita, unpublished. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (12Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Furusaka A. Tokushige K. Mizokami M. Wakita T. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1808-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Briefly cells grown on a cover glass were fixed in cold acetone-methanol, blocked with IF buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mm EDTA), and incubated for 1 h with the above described anti-NS5A mouse antibody diluted 1:50 with IF buffer. Subsequently the cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cappel, Durham, NC) diluted 1:50 with IF buffer. Coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides with Perma-Fluor™ mounting solution (Immunon, Pittsburgh, PA), and cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). RT-PCR and Sequencing Analysis—The cDNAs of the HCV RNA replicon were synthesized from total RNA isolated from replicon RNA-transfected cells. These cDNAs were subsequently amplified with DNA polymerase (TaKaRa LA™ Taq, Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). Five separate PCR primer sets were used to amplify nt 65-390, nt 150-2959, nt 2909-5598, nt 5568-7695, and nt 7627-7930 of the replicon construct to cover the entire open reading frame. The sequence of each amplified DNA fragment was determined with the ABI 3100 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). Quantification of Replicon RNA by Real Time-detection RT-PCR—Copy numbers of replicon RNA in cells were determined by real time detection RT-PCR using the ABI Prism 7700™ sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems) (18Takeuchi T. Katsume A. Tanaka T. Abe A. Inoue K. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Kawaguchi R. Tanaka S. Kohara M. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 636-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The data were adjusted by measuring intracellular glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase concentration with real time detection RT-PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistics—Statistical analysis was conducted with the Mann-Whitney U test, and p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Replication of JFH-1 Replicon in HepG2 and IMY-N9 Cells—To estimate the replication ability of the JFH-1 replicons in various cells, RNA transcribed from linearized pSGR-JFH1 and negative control pSGR-JFH1/GND with a mutation in the NS5B polymerase catalytic domain preventing replication (Fig. 1) were transfected into HepG2 and IMY-N9 along with Huh7. Transfected cells were cultured for 3 weeks with G418 at a working concentration of 0.8-1.0 mg/ml. Three weeks later, visible colonies were observed in all three cell lines that were transfected with transcribed replicon RNA from pSGR-JFH1, although the numbers of colonies in HepG2 and IMY-N9 were substantially lower than that in Huh7 (Fig. 2). All the transfections of synthesized RNA from pSGR-JFH1/GND resulted in no visible colony formation. In our previous study, colony formation efficiency of pSGR-JFH1 RNA in Huh7 was 5.32 × 104 ± 5.02 × 104 colony-forming units/μg of RNA (12Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Furusaka A. Tokushige K. Mizokami M. Wakita T. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1808-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Likewise the colony formation efficiencies in HepG2 and IMY-N9 were estimated to be 1.31 × 102 ± 0.74 × 102 and 1.88 × 101 ± 1.49 × 101 colony-forming units/μg of RNA, respectively, based on three independent assays. Then nine colonies were cloned from pSGR-JFH1 RNA-transfected HepG2 and IMY-N9 cells and cultured for further analysis. We previously determined that a point mutation of His to Leu at amino acid position 2476 (H2476L) in the JFH-1 replicon increases colony formation efficiency and enlarges colony size (12Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Furusaka A. Tokushige K. Mizokami M. Wakita T. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1808-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). We tested the colony formation of this JFH1/H2476L mutant replicon in HepG2 and IMY-N9 cells in this study. Colony formation efficiency of JFH1/H2476L RNA in Huh7 was 1.45 × 105 ± 2.38 × 104 colony-forming units/μg of RNA as reported previously (Ref. 12Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Furusaka A. Tokushige K. Mizokami M. Wakita T. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1808-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). Likewise the colony formation efficiencies when using JFH1/H2476L RNA in HepG2 and IMY-N9 also improved to 3.02 × 102 ± 1.48 × 102 and 6.29 × 101 ± 4.78 × 101 colony-forming units/μg of RNA, respectively, based on five independent assays (Fig. 2). The average colony sizes of JFH-1 replicon were estimated as 0.72 ± 0.15 mm2 in HepG2 and 0.50 ± 0.09 mm2 in IMY-N9 cells, respectively (Fig. 2). Similarly the average colony sizes of JFH1/H2476L were increased to 1.50 ± 0.30 mm2 in HepG2 and 1.35 ± 0.56 mm2 in IMY-N9 cells, respectively (Fig. 2). Detection of Replicon RNA—To estimate the size of the replicating replicon RNA, Northern blot analysis was performed with nine clones of each cell line, HepG2 and IMY-N9. In all of the clones, replicon RNA with the expected size of ∼8 kb was detected using neor and EMCV IRES probes (Fig. 3). The amount of replicon RNA in IMY-N9 was higher than that in HepG2, although it varied among the clones. To rule out the possibility that G418 resistance resulted from integration of the neor gene into the cellular genome, the integrated neor gene was estimated by PCR with genomic DNA isolated from each cell clone. However, the neor gene was not detected in any clones of either cell line, HepG2 or IMY-N9 (Fig. 4). To confirm the integrity of isolated genomic DNA from replicon cells, the β-globin gene was also amplified as described previously (16Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13369) Google Scholar), and positive signals were present in all DNA samples (Fig. 4). Thus, each DNA sample was shown to be sufficiently intact to allow amplification of an endogenous or integrated gene. These results demonstrated that the G418 resistance in JFH-1 replicon RNA-transfected HepG2 and IMY-N9 cells was not due to neor gene integration but replication of JFH-1 replicon RNA. Detection of HCV Protein Expression—Expression of HCV non-structural proteins in replicon RNA-transfected HepG2 and IMY-N9 cells was detected by Western blotting using the mouse polyclonal antibody specific for HCV NS5A. NS5A protein, primarily about 56 kDa in size, was detected by HCV-specific polyclonal antibody in JFH-1 replicon RNA-transfected IMY-N9 clones and in HepG2 clones (Fig. 5A). However, signals of these proteins in IMY-N9 clones were stronger than those in HepG2 clones, and additional smaller bands were observed in IMY-N9 clones (Fig. 5B). HCV antigens were also detected in JFH-1 replicon RNA-transfected HepG2 and IMY-N9 clones using NS5A-specific polyclonal antibody (Fig. 6). Fine reticular and granular cytoplasmic staining was observed in both replicon RNA-transfected cell clones, although no signal was detected in untransfected parental cells. Sequence Analysis of Cloned Replicon Cells—To estimate the adaptive mutations in HepG2 and IMY-N9, replicon RNA isolated from each clone was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced directly. Copy numbers of replicating RNA in clones were also determined by real time detection RT-PCR and compared with the data in Huh7. Based on multiple measurements, the mean copy number of replicating RNA in Huh7 was estimated to be 2.59 × 107 ± 1.97 × 107 copies/μg of RNA.2 Of the nine HepG2 clones, seven clones had one to three non-synonymous mutations, and two clones had no or one synonymous mutation in the HCV-derived region of the replicon (Table I). Most of the non-synonymous mutations were concentrated in NS5B (8 of 11 non-synonymous mutations). Copy numbers of HepG2 clone replicon RNA ranged from 6.67 × 105 to 2.55 × 107 copies/μg of RNA with an average of 6.32 × 106 ± 7.74 × 106 copies/μg of RNA. These replicon titers in clones were almost in agreement with data from Northern blotting. Copy numbers of replicon RNA in clones with no or one synonymous mutation were at the same level as in clones with non-synonymous mutations.Table IMutations of JFH-1 replicon in HepG2 cellsCloneNucleotideaPosition of mutated nucleotide within the subgenomic repliconAmino acidbPosition of mutated amino acid within the complete open reading frame of full-length JFH-1Affected regionReplicon titercRepresented as copies/μg of RNA16826C→AGln2714→LysNS5B2.55 × 10757125T→ANone9.92 × 10677072C→GPro2796→AlaNS5B6.67 × 10586580T→ASer2632→ThrNS5B2.46 × 1067159T→CTyr2825→HisNS5B93342A→GNone2.16 × 1063594C→ANone7230T→AAsn2848→LysNS5B105052T→CNone2.97 × 1066943C→APro2753→ThrNS5B113838A→GArg1718→GlyNS4B4.24 × 1063945T→CNone4355T→CIle1890→ThrNS4B5221C→TNone6601C→APro2639→ThrNS5B12NoneNone1.91 × 106134302C→TNone7.13 × 1065687G→AGly2334→AspNS5A6110A→GTyr2475→CysNS5Ba Position of mutated nucleotide within the subgenomic repliconb Position of mutated amino acid within the complete open reading frame of full-length JFH-1c Represented as copies/μg of RNA Open table in a new tab Of the nine IMY-N9 clones, three clones had no mutations in the HCV-derived region (Table II). Six clones had one or two synonymous mutations, and the affected regions were distributed randomly over the several regions. Copy numbers of replicon RNA in IMY-N9 clones ranged from 1.71 × 107 to 9.36 × 107 copies/μg of RNA with the average being 3.98 × 107 ± 2.78 × 107 copies/μg of RNA. This was significantly higher than in HepG2 cells (p < 0.005) and exceeded that in Huh7. As in HepG2, the replicon RNA titers in all the cloned IMY-N9 replicon cells were similar regardless of whether the replicon RNA contained these mutations. This indicates that the JFH-1 replicon can replicate efficiently without any amino acid mutations in HepG2 and IMY-N9 cells.Table IIMutations of JFH-1 replicon in IMY-N9 cellsCloneNucleotideaPosition of mutated nucleotide within the subgenomic repliconAmino acidbPosition of mutated amino acid within the complete open reading frame of full-length JFH-1Affected regionReplicon titercRepresented as copies/μg of RNA34609C→GPro1975→AlaNS4B3.03 × 1077044C→ANone4NoneNone2.74 × 10754395G→TMet1873→IleNS4B1.71 × 10763087C→AAsp1467→GluNS32.04 × 10775104A→GThr2140→AlaNS5A8.12 × 1075947G→CAla2421→ProNS5A87508T→GVal2941→GlyNS5B2.44 × 1079NoneNone3.89 × 10710NoneNone9.36 × 107112726T→ALeu1347→GlnNS32.54 × 107a Position of mutated nucleotide within the subgenomic repliconb Position of mutated amino acid within the complete open reading frame of full-length JFH-1c Represented as copies/μg of RNA Open table in a new tab The HCV replicon system is the only system able to mimic HCV replication in cultured cells, and it is utilized to assess antiviral drugs or to clarify the alteration of gene expression in host cells during HCV replication. However, the limited availability of isolate genotype 1 and culture cell line Huh7 posed a limitation to the investigations of viral and host characteristics in nature because it is questionable whether the data from these limited conditions reflect the general situation. Thus, studies with clones of multiple genotypes in multiple cell lines were required. We previously demonstrated that the genotype 2a replicon could efficiently replicate in Huh7, and here we showed that it can also replicate in other hepatocyte-derived cells, HepG2 and IMY-N9 cells. Sufficiently replicable cell culture systems or infection models with small animals are essential for understanding the viral life cycle. With regard to HCV, many studies on the infection or replication system in culture cells have been undertaken (7Bartenschlager R. Lohmann V. J. Gen.

Mitamura K. Yasui K. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Fournier C. Sureau C. Coste J. Ducos J. Pageaux G. Larrey D. Domergue J. Maurel P. J. Gen.

Trepo C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3007-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), but this susceptibility is limited to 90 days (25Rumin S. Berthillon P. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Trabaud M.A. Bizollon T. Gouillat C. Gripon P. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Inchauspe G. Trepo C. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 3007-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that some important cellular factors that support the HCV replication may be present only in differentiated human hepatocytes. As an HCV replication system with culture cells, IMY-N9 cells were developed by fusing human primary cultured hepatocytes and HepG2 (13Ito T. Yasui K. Mukaigawa J. Katsume A. Kohara M. Mitamura K. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 566-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and can support HCV replication at a higher level than the parental HepG2. However, HCV replication in these culture cells seems to be insufficient as replicated RNA could only be detected by RT-PCR. Thus, we exploited the IMY-N9 cell line for the HCV replicon system and obtained evidence of HCV replicon replication not only by RT-PCR but also by Northern blotting. After transfection of JFH-1 replicon RNA and selection with G418, visible colonies were observed in IMY-N9 and HepG2 as in Huh7 (Fig. 2). No replicon DNA integration was detected by genomic PCR analysis (Fig. 4). The colony-forming efficiencies were better for HepG2 than for IMY-N9, although both were substantially lower than that of Huh7. The reasons for these differences are unclear, but one possible explanation is the difference in transfection efficiency. In fact, the transfection efficiency of IMY-N9 was lower than that of HepG2 and Huh7 (data not shown). On the other hand, the ability of IMY-N9 to support HCV replication seemed to be higher than that of HepG2 or even that of Huh7. The amount of replicating replicon RNA was higher in IMY-N9 clones than in HepG2 clones in Northern blotting (Fig. 3). Likewise the mean replicon titer was higher in IMY-N9 clones than in HepG2 or Huh7. In Western blotting, the expression levels of HCV antigens were also stronger in IMY-N9 clones than in HepG2 clones (Fig. 5). Thus, IMY-N9 may contain some yet unidentified cellular factors that are advantageous for supporting HCV replication and that may be acquired by fusing with human primary hepatocytes. In Western blotting, additional smaller bands were observed in IMY-N9 clones using anti-NS5A. They may result from degraded proteins because of instability of HCV-related proteins in IMY-N9. Another possibility is that the incomplete translated proteins may be related to the robust replication of replicon RNA in IMY-N9 cells. Blight et al. (26Blight K.J. McKeating J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13001-13014Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) reported that RNA replication can only be detected in a subpopulation of Huh7 cells and that self-replicating subgenomic RNA could be eliminated from Huh7 clones by prolonged treatment with α interferon. For cells from which self-replicating subgenomic RNA was eliminated, a higher proportion could support HCV replication. Selection of subclones by interferon treatment may be an especially valuable step in the process of achieving increased HCV replication efficiency of HepG2 and IMY-N9 cells. Thus, interferon sensitivity of JFH-1 replicon in Huh7, HepG2, and IMY-N9 cells should be evaluated to establish such subclones. In our previous study, the JFH-1 replicon was found to replicate in Huh7 cells without non-synonymous mutation in the HCV-derived region, although the RNA titer of the replicon was lower than that of clones with mutations (12Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Furusaka A. Tokushige K. Mizokami M. Wakita T. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1808-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The H2476L mutation found in Huh7 replicon cells was recognized as an adaptive mutation since the replicons containing this mutation had increased colony formation efficiency and colony size (12Kato T. Date T. Miyamoto M. Furusaka A. Tokushige K. Mizokami M. Wakita T. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 1808-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). JFH1/H2476L mutant replicon was tested for its ability to form colonies in HepG2 and IMY-N9 cells in this study and found to also increase colony formation efficiency and colony size (Fig. 2). Thus, H2476L also functions as an adaptive mutation in HepG2 and IMY-N9 cells. It should be determined whether a portion of the mutations found in HepG2 and IMY-N9 replicon clones may also function as adaptive mutations. In this study, two of nine HepG2 clones and three of nine IMY-N9 clones had no or one synonymous mutation in the HCV-derived region (Tables I and II). However, unlike in Huh7, the RNA titer in these clones was not lower than that of clones with mutations in HepG2 and IMY-N9 cell lines. Therefore, adaptive mutation might not be needed in the JFH-1 replicon to replicate efficiently. Based on sequence analysis of isolated clones in HepG2, mutated amino acids were concentrated in the NS5B region. On the other hand, there were fewer mutated amino acids in IMY-N9 than in HepG2, and they were distributed randomly. These differences may be due to differences in cellular factors between HepG2 and IMY-N9. In HepG2, mutations of NS5B in the JFH-1 replicon may enhance the colony-forming ability or replication capacity. In IMY-N9, replicon RNA was found to replicate efficiently using the native genome of JFH-1 replicon, and mutations are not introduced as frequently. However, the effect of these mutations in HepG2 and IMY-N9 replicon clones should be determined by examining the replication of mutations introduced in replicon constructs. Although many attempts have been made to establish the replicon system with other human hepatocyte-derived cell lines, these efforts have been unsuccessful with the exception of Huh7. Our investigation revealed that incorporating the HCV replicon system in two other hepatocyte-derived cell lines, HepG2 and IMY-N9, is possible. The major factor of this accomplishment is the difference in the replicon clone used. The HCV clone used to produce the JFH-1 replicon was of genotype 2a and was isolated from a fulminant hepatitis patient. This replicon clone has potent replication ability beyond that previously reported in a clone that had adaptive mutations in its genome. Furthermore it can replicate in Huh7 without any adaptive mutations. To estimate the tissue tropisms of HCV using this robust replicable replicon, further trials in non-hepatocyte-derived cells should be undertaken. Recently replication of HCV genotype 1b replicon in HeLa and mouse hepatoma cells has been reported (27Zhu Q. Guo J.T. Seeger C. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9204-9210Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, RNA replication was only observed when cellular RNA isolated from Huh7 replicon cells was transfected, and the replicon isolated from these clones contained several adaptive mutations. It will be informative to assess whether the JFH-1 replicon can replicate in these cell lines without mutations. The full-length RNA replicon with isolates Con1 and HCV-N has already been investigated (28Ikeda M. Yi M. Li K. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2997-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 29Pietschmann T. Lohmann V. Kaul A. Krieger N. Rinck G. Rutter G. Strand D. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4008-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, no evidence of HCV particle assembly and release from Huh7 has been observed. Thus, Huh7 may be devoid of the factors associated with these steps. By using the full-length replicon with JFH-1 clone in HepG2 or IMY-N9 cells, HCV particle assembly and release may be accomplished, but further investigation is required. In summary, HCV genotype 2a replicon could replicate in HepG2 and IMY-N9 cells. Studies using this replicon system will shed light on understanding the mechanisms of HCV replication, host-virus interaction, and antiviral drug evaluation."

We report here the presence of a 13 C depletion associated with a 15 N enrichment in an anhydrous interplanetary dust particle. Our observations suggest that the anomalies are carried by heteroatomic organic compounds. Theoretical models indicate that low-temperature formation of organic compounds in cold interstellar molecular clouds can produce carbon and nitrogen fractionations, but it remains to be seen whether the specific effects observed here can be reproduced."
https://openalex.org/W2025318615,"The DNA of most vertebrate sperm cells is packaged by protamines. The primary structure of mammalian protamine I can be divided into three domains, a central DNA binding domain that is arginine-rich and amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains that are rich in cysteine residues. In native bull sperm chromatin, intramolecular disulfide bonds hold the terminal domains of bull protamine folded back onto the central DNA binding domain, whereas intermolecular disulfide bonds between DNA-bound protamines help stabilize the chromatin of mature mammalian sperm cells. Folded bull protamine was used to condense DNA in vitro under various solution conditions. Using transmission electron microscopy and light scattering, we show that bull protamine forms particles with DNA that are morphologically similar to the subunits of native bull sperm chromatin. In addition, the stability provided by intermolecular disulfide bonds formed between bull protamine molecules within in vitro DNA condensates is comparable with that observed for native bull sperm chromatin. The importance of the bull protamine terminal domains in controlling the bull sperm chromatin morphology is indicated by our observation that DNA condensates formed under identical conditions with a fish protamine, which lacks cysteine-rich terminal domains, do not produce as uniform structures as bull protamine.

During vertebrate spermiogenesis, chromatin is dramatically reorganized in developing spermatids as histones and other nonhistone-chromosomal proteins are replaced by arginine-rich oligopeptides known as protamines (1Lewis J.D.

Each protamine-DNA particle is estimated to contain on the order of 50 kb of DNA (21Hud N.V. Allen M.J. Downing K.H. Lee J. Balhorn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Few attempts have been made to reconstitute mammalian sperm cell chromatin using purified mammalian protamines, and reported efforts have not yielded protamine-DNA condensates with DNA as highly condensed as that found in mature sperm cell chromatin (8Allen M.J. Bradbury E.M. Balhorn R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2221-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Some mammalian sperm cells contain two different types of protamine, referred to as protamine I and protamine II. Protamine I is present in all mammalian sperm cells, and its amino acid sequence is relatively conserved among mammals. The protamines of other vertebrates, such as fish, are similar to protamine I of mammals. Protamine II is less conserved and is found only in a subset of mammals, including humans (22Balhorn R. Adolph K.W. Molecular Biology of Chromosome Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 366-395Crossref Google Scholar). Fish protamines and mammalian protamine I have been the focus of most studies concerning DNA condensation by protamines, primarily because protamine I is more widely distributed than protamine II and because species from which sperm cells are most readily obtained do not contain protamine II (e.g. salmon, bull). Mammalian protamine I is typically 50 amino acids in length. Each protamine I sequence has a central arginine-rich domain that binds in the major groove of DNA and is flanked by cysteine-rich domains at both ends (9Prieto M.C. Maki A.H. Balhorn R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11944-11951Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Hud N.V. Milanovich F.P. Balhorn R.

An alignment of mammalian protamine I amino acid sequences reveals a significant degree of conservation of the cysteine residue positions in comparison with other sequence elements of protamine (22Balhorn R. Adolph K.W. Molecular Biology of Chromosome Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 366-395Crossref Google Scholar, 23Adroer R. Queralt R. Ballabriga J. Oliva R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 609Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between protamines bound to DNA apparently creates a network of cross-linked protamines that accounts for the greater stability of mammalian sperm cell chromatin in comparison with the sperm cell chromatin of species with protamines that lack cysteine residues (e.g. salmon protamine) (16Balhorn R. Corzett M. Mazrimas J. Watkins B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Several models have been presented to explain how protamines package DNA in sperm cells (16Balhorn R. Corzett M. Mazrimas J. Watkins B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Raukas E. Mikelsaar R.H. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25Verdaguer N.

However, no model has provided a complete explanation for the specific positions of cysteine residues in mammalian protamines or for the possibility of an active role for the cysteine-rich ends in the condensation of DNA. We have sought to determine the role of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of mammalian protamine I. These end domains are absent from fish protamines and do not condense DNA as isolated peptide sequences (28Brewer L. Corzett M. Lau E.Y. Balhorn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42403-42408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Bull sperm cells use only protamine I; therefore, bull protamine is an ideal model system for the study of DNA packing by protamine I in mammalian sperm cells. Here we report transmission electron microscopy and light-scattering studies of bull protamine-DNA condensates prepared in vitro. As part of these investigations, we have condensed DNA with bull protamine in the presence of varying concentrations of salt and the disulfide reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol. Bull protamine was found to condense DNA into spherical particles that are within the size range of protamine-DNA condensates observed in bull sperm cell nuclei. We also demonstrate that the in vitro formation of disulfide cross-links by bull protamine cysteines produces salt-stable protamine-DNA condensates. A comparison of results with condensates formed by the condensation of DNA with salmon protamine indicates that the cysteine-rich ends of mammalian protamine play an active role in DNA condensation, even before intermolecular disulfide bond formation. Based upon these observations and previously reported disulfide bond assignments, we sought to determine whether folded bull protamine would be expected to bind to DNA in a unique manner that promotes intermolecular disulfide bond formation. A model is presented that illustrates how the native folding of bull protamine is expected to place specific cysteine residues at positions that would allow the formation of an extensive network of intermolecular disulfide bonds in bull sperm chromatin. The ability to prepare native-like mammalian sperm cell chromatin with purified bull protamine, as described in the current work, could prove of value in further studies of protamine function, such as investigations of sperm chromatin reorganization by egg cell extracts. DNA and Protamine Preparation—Bluescript II SK-(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was grown in DH5α (Invitrogen), isolated using the Qiagen Maxi-Prep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and linearized by digestion with the restriction enzyme HindIII (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Following digestion, the DNA buffer was changed to 20 mm sodium cacodylate, 200 μm EDTA (pH 7.5) by washing at least five times on a Microcon YM-30 spin column (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After the final rinse, DNA was resuspended from the spin column membrane in 20 mm sodium cacodylate, 200 μm EDTA (pH 7.5). DNA concentration was verified spectrophotometrically. Bluescript II SK- is 2961 bp long and is abbreviated as 3-kb DNA throughout the text. Bull protamine was isolated from intact bull sperm cells (American Breeders Services, DeForest, WI) following a previously described protocol (29Balhorn R. Gledhill B.L. Wyrobek A.J. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4074-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated native bull sperm cell chromatin was solubilized in 2.6 m urea, 1.1 m NaCl, 0.9 m guanidine hydrochloride (GuCl), and 150 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. DNA was precipitated from the solution of solubilized sperm chromatin with concentrated HCl. After dialysis of the bull protamine solution against 10 mm HCl, bull protamine was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed in acetone, and dissolved in dH2O. The bull protamine was then loaded on an equilibrated CM Sephadex C25 cation-exchange column for additional purification. The column was rinsed with dH2O and then with 4 m NaCl. Bull protamine was eluted with 4 m GuCl. The GuCl fraction was collected, dialyzed extensively against 10 mm HCl, freeze-dried, and resuspended in dH2O. The concentration of bull protamine in the purified stock solution was determined by comparing the intensity of naphtol blue-black-stained bull protamine bands on an acid urea slab gel (30Ammer H. Henschen A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 1619-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) against a set of salmon protamine bands of known concentrations. Gel band intensities were determined using an AlphaImager 2200 gel imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The number of reduced cysteines/molecule of bull protamine in the purified stock solution was determined colorimetrically with the Ellman reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's protocol in a reaction buffer containing 6.7 m GuCl and 0.2 m bicine, pH 8.0. The concentration of reduced cysteines in bull protamine stock solution was divided by bull protamine molar concentration to obtain an average number of reduced cysteines/bull protamine molecule. An aliquot of the purified bull protamine stock solution was completely reduced at 4 °C in 3.5 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m Tris (pH 8) and then dialyzed three times against 10 liters of 10 mm HCl and freeze-dried. The average number of reduced cysteines/fully reduced bull protamine was determined using Ellman reagent as described above. The folded state of purified bull protamine was evaluated by gel mobilities of samples of purified and fully reduced bull protamine stock solutions on an acid urea slab gel (14Balhorn R. Corzett M. Mazrimas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Ammer H. Henschen A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1987; 368: 1619-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Salmon protamine sulfate (Sigma) was converted to the chloride salt by dissolving in dH2O, dialyzing against 10 liters of 10 mm HCl three times, and freeze-drying. The amount of salmon protamine chloride recovered was determined gravimetrically. DNA Condensation—All solutions were filtered through Amicon Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filters with 0.22-μm pore diameter (Millipore) prior to use in condensation reactions. 7.5 μl of 60 μm DNA (units of base pair moles/liter) in 20 mm sodium cacodylate, 200 μm EDTA (pH 7.5) was mixed with an equal volume of 4.5 μm bull protamine or 5.6 μm salmon protamine in dH2O. The resulting condensation reaction buffer conditions (10 mm sodium cacodylate, 100 μm EDTA, pH 7.5) are referred to in the text as low ionic strength buffer. DNA was allowed to condense at room temperature for varying times (0–60 min) and then was diluted 2-fold by mixing with an equal volume of 10 mm sodium cacodylate, 100 μm EDTA (pH 7.5). Electron Microscopy—Protamine-DNA condensate reaction mixtures were deposited on carbon-coated grids (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). After 10 min on the grid, 2% uranyl acetate (Ted Pella) was added momentarily to the condensate mixture; the grids were then rinsed in 95% ethanol and air-dried. Images of DNA condensates were recorded on film using a JEOL-100C transmission electron microscope (TEM) 1The abbreviations used are: TEM, transmission electron microscope; BP, bull protamine; GuCl, guanidine hydrochloride. at ×100,000 magnification. TEM negatives were scanned at 300 pixels/inch, and a graphics program was used to measure the size of DNA condensates. Condensate Stability Studies—To determine the salt stability of protamine-DNA condensates, particles were prepared as described above except that in the last step the condensate reaction solutions were diluted 2-fold with 2 m NaCl in 10 mm sodium cacodylate, 100 μm EDTA (pH 7.5). DNA condensates were imaged with TEM as described above. DNA condensate stability was also monitored by measuring the average intensity of light scattering of the solutions using a DynaPro MS/X dynamic light-scattering instrument (Proterion, Piscataway, NJ) with a laser of wavelength 824.8 nm and a constant scattering collection angle of 90°. To determine the salt stability of protamine-DNA condensates in the presence of a disulfide bond-reducing agent, DNA condensates were prepared as described above except that in the last step the condensate solutions were diluted 2-fold by adding a high salt/urea denaturing solution containing 2.6 m urea, 1.1 m NaCl, 0.9 m GuCl, and varying concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol. The DNA condensates were monitored with static as well as dynamic light scattering. Condensation of DNA by Folded Bull Protamine—The principle goal of the present study was to determine whether purified bull protamine (BP) is able to condense DNA in vitro in a manner similar to that observed in native mammalian sperm cell chromatin. One of the outstanding features of BP is a high percentage of cysteine residues (Fig. 1A). In mature bull sperm cells, four of the seven cysteines of BP participate in the formation of two intramolecular disulfide bonds (Cys-6–Cys-14 and Cys-39–Cys-47) (16Balhorn R. Corzett M. Mazrimas J. Watkins B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These native intramolecular disulfides constrain the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains to be folded back toward the central arginine-rich domain (Fig. 1B); the remaining three cysteines, Cys-5, -22, and -38, form inter-molecular disulfide bonds between neighboring protamine molecules in mature bull sperm cell chromatin (16Balhorn R. Corzett M. Mazrimas J. Watkins B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In sperm cells, the intramolecular disulfide bonds are formed while protamines are bound to DNA and before the formation of the inter-molecular disulfide bonds (22Balhorn R. Adolph K.W. Molecular Biology of Chromosome Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 366-395Crossref Google Scholar). For proteins that contain multiple cysteine residues, correct disulfide bond formation is essential for the protein to fold and function properly, either as an enzyme or in a structural role (31Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1993Google Scholar). To create native-like sperm cell chromatin in vitro, we believed it prudent to begin with BP in a folded state with preformed intramolecular disulfide bonds. Using BP folded with native intramolecular disulfides would greatly reduce the possibility of unnatural disulfide bond formation in our protamine-DNA condensates and therefore more likely produce DNA condensates that resemble native sperm cell chromatin. The folded state of purified BP with two intramolecular disulfide bonds was verified by Ellman-free thiol analysis and PAGE (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purified BP stock solution was determined to have, on average, 2.6 free thiols/molecule, which is within experimental error of three free thiols/molecule. This result is consistent with the presence of two disulfide bonds/bull protamine molecule. As a control, the average number of free thiols in a fully reduced BP sample was determined to be seven cysteines/molecule. The folded and unfolded (fully reduced) forms of BP have been shown to exhibit different electrophoretic mobilities in acid-urea polyacrylamide gels (14Balhorn R. Corzett M. Mazrimas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The greater electrophoretic mobility of purified BP with respect to a fully reduced sample (Fig. 1C) verified that the disulfide bonds in purified BP are two intramolecular disulfides bonds. It should be noted that some of our folded BP might have participated in intramolecular disulfide bond exchange during the isolation process. However, it has been shown that even completely reduced BP will refold to a small number of folded conformers, with the majority closely resembling the native fold of BP containing two intramolecular disulfides (14Balhorn R. Corzett M. Mazrimas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Linear 3-kb DNA was mixed with folded BP in a low ionic strength buffer (10 mm sodium cacodylate, 100 μm EDTA, pH 7.5) at a charge ratio of 1:1 (DNA phosphate:BP arginine). The absolute concentration of DNA in the final sample was 15 μm in nucleotide base pair. Mixing BP with DNA resulted in the formation of spherical DNA condensate particles that showed little tendency for aggregation (Fig. 2A). Based upon electron microscopy measurements, the average diameter of the DNA condensates obtained with BP was 60 nm. A spherical particle of this size corresponds to ∼20 3-kb DNA molecules/condensate, based upon the previously measured density of DNA packing by protamines (i.e. hexagonal close-packed with a helix-to-helix spacing of 2.7 nm) (32Loir M. Bouvier D. Fornells M. Lanneau M. Subirana J.A. Chromosoma. 1985; 92: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 33Blanc N.S. Senn A. Leforestier A. Livolant F. Dubochet J. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 134: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The smallest particles observed among the BP-DNA condensates were ∼22 nm in diameter (Fig. 2A), which corresponds to the condensation of a single 3-kb DNA packed at the same density. The linear 3-kb DNA was also condensed with salmon protamine (salmine) at the same 1:1 charge ratio of DNA phosphate:salmine arginine. Salmine lacks the cysteine-rich amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains of BP that are a common feature of mammalian protamine I (Fig. 1A). Thus, comparison of DNA condensates formed by BP and salmine can be employed as a means to investigate the effects of the cysteine-rich amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of mammalian protamines on DNA condensation. DNA condensation by salmine, under the same experimental conditions, resulted in the formation of DNA condensates with a wider diversity of particle morphologies (Fig. 2B). Spherical particles were still the predominant morphology; however, toroidal condensates were also observed. In contrast to BP-DNA condensates, salmine-DNA condensates vary more in size and exhibit a greater tendency to aggregate (Fig. 2). The variety of salmine-DNA condensate morphologies observed in the present study is in agreement with previous reports (21Hud N.V. Allen M.J. Downing K.H. Lee J. Balhorn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 34Sorgi F.L. Bhattacharya S. Huang L. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The lack of the cysteine-rich domains in salmine and the similarity between the arginine-rich central domains of salmine and BP suggest that the terminal domains of bull protamine play an active role in controlling particle structure. This result was unexpected, because the cysteine-rich domains of protamine I have typically been considered to provide additional stability to protamine-DNA condensates (16Balhorn R. Corzett M. Mazrimas J. Watkins B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Balhorn R. Adolph K.W. Molecular Biology of Chromosome Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 366-395Crossref Google Scholar) but have not previously been suggested to have a role in controlling DNA condensate particle size or morphology. Formation of Salt-stable Bull Protamine-DNA Condensates—The stability of mammalian sperm cell chromatin at high salt concentrations is a hallmark of the intermolecular disulfide bonds that exist between protamine molecules because the arginines of protamines bind to DNA through electrostatic interactions that are subject to competition by salts. High ionic strength solution conditions were used to investigate the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds within BP-DNA condensates prepared in vitro. BP-DNA condensates produced in low ionic strength buffer were allowed to incubate at room temperature for different condensation times; then the ionic strength of the solution was increased to 1 m by the addition of an equal volume of 2 m NaCl. Prior to the addition of NaCl, the size and morphology of the BP-DNA condensates at low ionic strength did not change appreciably with increasing condensation time (Fig. 3, A–D). However, the stability of BP-DNA condensates to high ionic strength increased with time between condensation and the addition of NaCl (Fig. 3, E–H). In general, for condensation times between 5 to 30 min, aggregation and partial decondensation of BP-DNA condensates were observed (Fig. 3, E–G). After a condensation time of 60 min (Fig. 3H), BP-DNA condensates were completely stable upon the addition of 1 m NaCl, as particles both maintained their shape and did not aggregate after the substantial increase in ionic strength. BP-DNA condensates challenged with 1 m NaCl were not as numerous on electron microscopy grids as on those produced under low ionic strength conditions (Fig. 3). This is likely because of a lower affinity of the BP-DNA particles to the grids at high ionic strength. The time constant for the stabilization of BP-DNA condensates in 1 m NaCl was determined more precisely by measuring the average light-scattering intensity of condensate solutions after the addition of NaCl to the low ionic strength condensation reaction. As shown in Fig. 4, the average light-scattering intensity of a BP-DNA condensate solution in 1 m NaCl increases exponentially with condensation time. Given the 90° detection angle used to detect scattered light, the increase in average light scattering can be attributed to the increase in concentration of densely packed DNA condensates as well as a decrease in the extent of aggregation of condensate particles (35Bloomfield V.A. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 36Berne B.J. Pecora R. Dynamic Light Scattering with Applications to Chemistry, Biology, and Physics.

These light-scattering results are perfectly consistent with the BP-DNA condensates shown by the TEM images in Fig. 3. A least-squares best fit of the light-scattering data with a single exponential function revealed a time constant for the stabilization of BP-DNA condensates to high ionic strength conditions of ∼7 min. To illustrate that the salt stability of BP-DNA condensates was because of the cysteine-rich amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, a similar set of experiments was carried out with salmine. Salmine-DNA condensates were also prepared in the low ionic strength buffer and challenged by the addition of an equal vo"

OPN is a target gene for β-catenin-T cell factor signaling, which is commonly disturbed during mammary oncogenesis, but the understanding of OPN regulation is incomplete. Data base-assisted bioinformatic analysis of the OPN promoter region has revealed the presence of T cell factor-, Ets-, and AP-1-binding motifs. Here we report that β-catenin, Lef-1, Ets transcription factors, and the AP-1 protein c-Jun each weakly enhanced luciferase expression from a OPN promoter-luciferase reporter construct, transiently transfected into a rat mammary cell line. OPN promoter responsiveness to β-catenin and Lef-1, however, was considerably enhanced by Ets transcription factors including Ets-1, Ets-2, ERM, and particularly PEA3. PEA3 also enhanced promoter responsiveness to the AP-1 protein c-Jun. Co-transfection of cells with β-catenin, Lef-1, PEA3, and c-Jun in combination increased luciferase expression by up to 280-fold and induced expression of endogenous rat OPN. In six human breast cell lines, those that highly expressed OPN also expressed PEA3 and Ets-1. Moreover, there was a significant association of immunocytochemical staining for OPN and one of β-catenin, Ets-1, Ets-2, PEA3, or c-Jun, in the 29 human breast carcinomas tested. This study shows that β-catenin/Lef-1, Ets, and AP-1 transcription factors can cooperate in a rat mammary cell line in stimulating transcription of OPN and that their independent presence is associated with that of OPN in a group of human breast cancers. These results suggest that the presence of these transcription factors in human breast cancer is responsible in part for the overexpression of OPN that, in turn, is implicated in mammary neoplastic progression and metastasis.

Hota C. Wilson S.M. Chambers A.F. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). OPN transcription may be activated by the Ras oncogene (2Guo X. Zhang Y.P. Mitchell D.A.

Transfection of an expression vector for OPN induces malignant transformation and induction of metastasis in a benign rat mammary epithelial cell line (9Oates A.J. Barraclough R. Rudland P.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 97-104PubMed Google Scholar), whereas transfection of OPN antisense cDNA inhibits these processes in a cell line already overexpressing osteopontin (10Su L. Mukherjee A.B.

These results suggest that OPN overexpression may represent a key molecular event in tumor progression and metastasis, particularly that of the breast. Unlike many proto-oncogenes activated by a gain of function mutation, OPN is not typically mutated during stepwise tumorigenesis (3Weber G.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1552: 61-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Instead various responsive elements in its promoter regulate OPN expression for its diverse physiological roles (12Sato M.

Xia W. Wang J.C. Kwong K.Y. Spohn B. Wen Y. Pestell R.G. Hung M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 16Miyoshi K. Rosner A. Nozawa M.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5548-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). β-Catenin translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to the Tcf/Lef family to initiate transcription of responsive genes (17Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar, 18Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V.

Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). β-Catenin and OPN overexpression may coincide (20Nagai S. Hashimoto S. Yamashita T. Toyoda N. Satoh T. Suzuki T. Matsushima K. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and activated β-catenin may induce OPN expression in migrating cells (21Muller T. Bain G. Wang X. Papkoff J. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 280: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). OPN may be a transcriptional target of the β-catenin-Tcf complex (22El-Tanani M. Barraclough R. Wilkinson M.C. Rudland P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5619-5629PubMed Google Scholar). Lef/Tcf factors are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that have a single high mobility group domain, located in the middle or near their C terminus (23Giese K. Pagel J. Grosschedl R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The ability of Lef-1 to regulate transcription may involve its association with different DNA-binding proteins (24Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 25Carlsson P. Waterman M.L. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2418-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Giese K. Grosschedl R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4667-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The OPN promoter also contains inter alia, AP-1 (27Kim H.J. Lee M.H. Shin H.I. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. J. Cell Biochem. 2002; 87: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and Ets transcription factor-binding domains (12Sato M. Morii E. Komori T. Kawahata H. Sugimoto M. Terai K. Shimizu H. Yasui T. Ogihara H. Yasui N. Ochi T. Kitamura Y. Ito Y. Nomura S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1517-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of AP-1 or Ets sites separately impede OPN transcription in several cell lines and reporter-promoter systems, suggesting their involvement at this promoter (27Kim H.J. Lee M.H. Shin H.I. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. J. Cell Biochem. 2002; 87: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In a data base-assisted bioinformatics analysis, we identified three Lef-1/Tcf-binding sites (CAAAG) in addition to one AP-1-binding domain (TGAGTCA) and three Ets-binding motifs (AGGAAR) within the rat OPN promoter. Although Ets proteins bind to DNA recognition sites bearing a 5′-AGGA(A/T)-3′ central core, flanking sequences influence their binding specificity (28Oikawa T. Yamada T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 303: 11-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). AP-1 and Ets proteins participate in transcriptional regulation of metastasis-associated matrix metalloproteinases (29Himelstein B.P. Lee E.J. Sato H. Seiki M. Muschel R.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1995-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and synergize with β-catenin-Lef-1 in regulation of tumor associated matrilysin (30Crawford H.C. Fingleton B. Gustavson M.D. Kurpios N. Wagenaar R.A. Hassell J.A. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1370-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Activation of transcription factors AP-1 and members of the Ets family may therefore represent key events in cell transformation (31Wasylyk B. Wasylyk C. Flores P. Begue A. Leprince D. Stehelin D. Nature. 1990; 346: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that β-catenin-Lef-1 synergizes with AP-1 and Ets in regulation of OPN expression, we have transfected Rama 37 rat mammary epithelial cells with an OPN promoter-luciferase reporter construct and cDNA expression vectors for β-catenin, Lef-1, the AP-1 protein c-Jun, and for the Ets family of transcription factors, alone and in combination. PEA3 (polyomavirus enhancer activator protein 3), an Ets family member, rendered the OPN promoter strongly responsive to transactivation by β-catenin/Lef-1 or c-Jun. Ets family members PEA3 and Ets-1 were overexpressed in human breast cancer cell lines that highly expressed OPN. Moreover, Ets family members as well as c-Jun and β-catenin were highly expressed in the primary breast tumors that highly expressed OPN. We conclude that β-catenin, AP-1, and Ets pathways can synergize to provoke transcriptional up-regulation of OPN expression in a cultured rat mammary cell line. The co-incident expression of β-catenin, AP-1, Ets family members, and OPN in breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors suggest that they may be implicated in the dysregulation of OPN in breast cancer.

Mutagenesis of the Osteopontin Promoter—The OPN promoter firefly luciferase reporter constructs with mutated Lef-1-, AP-1-, and Ets-binding sites were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A mutant of one Lef-1-binding site was generated at position –1954 to –1960 (Mut –1960) using CAC TCA GGG GTC CGC GGT AGT CCT GGA AGG GTC and GAC CCT TCC AGG ACT ACC GCG GAC CCC TGA GTG forward and reverse primers, respectively. The start of the 2285-bp promoter fragment is defined as –1, the TATA box is in positions –28 to –23, and the start of the primary transcript from the OPN gene is at +1. A double mutant in two Lef-1-binding sites was generated at positions –1457 to –1463 in addition to the mutated site above (Mut –1960/–1463), using GAT GGC TAG TAC CCG CGG TGT TTG ACT TAA TTC and GGA TTA AGT CAA ACC CCG CGG GTA CTA GCC ATC as forward and reverse primers, respectively. A triple mutant in three Lef-1-binding sites was generated at positions –1115 to –1121 in addition to the two mutated sites above (Mut –1960/–1463/–1121) using CTT AAA GAT CGA CCG CGG TAC CTT ACA AAT C and GAT TTG TAA CGT ACC GCG GTC GAT CTT TAA G as forward and reverse primers, respectively.

Cell Lines and Transient Transfections—Rama 37, ZR-75, T47-D, MDA-MB-231, Huma 7, Huma 109, and Huma 123 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were harvested and seeded in multiwell plates at 2.5 × 105 cells/3.5-cm-diameter well in 1 ml of serum-free medium. After 24 h, the cells were co-transfected with the predetermined optimal amounts of the following, where indicated: 200 ng of Ets-1, Ets-2, ERM, and PEA3 in their respective expression vectors; 300 ng of Lef-1 and β-catenin expression vectors; and 1 μg of wild type or mutant OPN promoter firefly luciferase reporter constructs. The assays for the firefly luciferase-linked promoter also contained a control expression vector of 5 ng of pRL Renilla luciferase (Promega). The concentration of pRL Renilla luciferase was reduced to avoid interference with the firefly luciferase assay, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were incubated for a further 24 h and harvested in 300 μl of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and firefly luciferase and control Renilla luciferase were simultaneously assayed, as described in the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and reported previously (40El-Tanani M. Fernig D.G. Barraclough R. Green C. Rudland P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41675-41682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Maximum activity was reached by 48 h, and the results at 72 h were similar. Gel Shift Assays—Gel shift assays were performed as described previously (22El-Tanani M. Barraclough R. Wilkinson M.C. Rudland P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5619-5629PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded 20-mer oligonucleotides containing one wild type Lef-1-binding site (specific activity ∼5 × 108 cpm/μg), either GGG GTT ACA AAG AGT CCT GG and AGA TCG ATT CAA AGA CGT TA or one mutated Lef-1-binding site, AGA TCG ACC GCG GTA CGT TA (specific activity, ∼5 × 108 cpm/μg) with 8 μl of protein extract from a reticulocyte cell-free transcription-translation protein synthesizing lysate for 1 h at 20 °Cin30 μl of 0.03 m KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.01 m HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1.4 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), 1 μg of single-stranded salmon sperm DNA, 0.01% (w/v) SDS for 40 min at 0 °C. The samples were electrophoresed through nondenaturing 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, which were dried, exposed to Fuji X-Omat film for 18 h with an intensifying screen, and processed for autoradiography. The reticulocyte lysate was incubated with the expression vectors for Lef-1 or with buffer alone in a cell-free protein-synthesizing transcription-translation system to generate the relevant protein, as described previously (40El-Tanani M.

Northern Blotting—Complementary DNA probes were generated by digestion of OPN, Ets-1, or PEA3 expression vectors with EcoRI/KpnI, Hind III/NotI, or EcoRI restriction enzymes, respectively. Fifty ng of each purified cDNA probe was radioactively labeled using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) to a specific activity of 5 × 108 dpm/μg. Total cellular RNA was isolated from the relevant cell lines using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and 10 μg of total RNA was run on a 1% (w/v) agarose denaturing formaldehyde gel. Nucleic acids were blotted on to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary transfer in 10× SSC buffer (1× SSC in 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate). The probe was hybridized to a blot in UltraHyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences), which was washed to high stringency. The washed membrane was exposed to x-ray film (Fuji) for 3 days at –70 °C, using an intensifying screen. The resultant autoradiographs were analyzed by densitometry using a CS-9000 dual wavelength Flying Spot scanner (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). The OPN, Ets-1, and PEA3 densitometer readings were corrected for differences in the amounts of RNA loaded in each lane by normalizing them relative to the GAPDH mRNA reading for each lane (41El-Tanani M.K.

After staining of representative sections with hematoxylin and eosin, all of the specimens proved to be invasive breast carcinoma of no special type. For subsequent immunocytochemical staining for β-catenin, PEA, and c-Jun, the sections were subjected to antigen retrieval by immersing them in 0.01 m sodium citrate (pH 6.0) and heating in a domestic microwave oven at 850 watts for 15 min. The slides were allowed to cool for a further 15 min in citrate buffer (44Platt-Higgins A.M. Renshaw C.A. West C.R. Winstanley J.H. De Silva Rudland S. Barraclough R. Rudland P.S. Int. J.

All of these antibodies recognized the correct size antigens on Western blots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Blocking antigens for OPN, β-catenin, Tcf-4, Ets-1, Ets-2, PEA3, and c-Jun, respectively, were human recombinant OPN (cc-1074), blocking peptide to β-catenin (sc-1496P), blocking peptide to Tcf-4 (sc-8631P), blocking peptide to Ets-1 (sc-350P), blocking peptide to Ets-2 (sc-351P), general blocking peptide for Ets family (sc-112P), and reticulocyte cell-free transcription translation protein synthesizing lysate primed with expression vector for PEA3 as described earlier under “Experimental Procedures” (40El-Tanani M.

https://openalex.org/W2007665513,"IFI16 is a member of the PYRIN superfamily that has been implicated in BRCA1-mediated apoptosis and inflammation signaling pathways. Here we report that most breast cancer cell lines examined expressed decreased mRNA and protein levels of IFI16, although IFI16 is expressed in human primary normal mammary epithelial cells. Significantly, immunohistochemical analysis of tissues from 25 breast cancer patients demonstrated that carcinoma cells showed negative or weaker staining of IFI16 compared with positive nuclear staining in normal mammary duct epithelium. si-RNA-mediated reduction of IFI16 resulted in perturbation of p53 activation when treated with ionizing radiation (IR). Expression of IFI16 enhanced p53 transcriptional activity in cells exposed to IR. Adenovirus expression of IFI16 in IFI16-deficient MCF7 induced apoptosis, which was enhanced by radiomimetic neocarcinostatin treatment. Tetracycline-regulated IFI16 also induced apoptosis when coexpressed with p53 in p53-deficient EJ cells subjected to IR, suggesting that IFI16 is involved in p53-mediated transmission of apoptosis signaling. Consistent with these results, expression of IFI16 enhanced activation of the known p53 target genes, including p21, Hdm2, and bax in MCF7 cells. These results suggest that loss of IFI16 results in deregulation of p53-mediated apoptosis, leading to cancer development.

These results suggest that loss of IFI16 results in deregulation of p53-mediated apoptosis, leading to cancer development. IFI16 has been identified as a target of interferon α and γ and is a member of the HIN-200 family (1Johnstone R.W. Trapani J.A. Mol. Cell.

GAL4DBD-fused full-length IFI16 acts as a potent transcription repressor when positioned in proximity to a promoter containing consensus GAL4DBD binding sequences (3Johnstone R.W. Kerry J.A.

Each of the 200 amino acids repeat regions contains this transrepression activity independently, and the N-terminal can bind DNA (4Dawson M.J. Trapani J.A. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A nuclear function of IFI16 was postulated by the findings that IFI16 and its mouse homolog p202 interact with p53, Rb, E2F, AP1, and NFκB proteins (5Datta B. Li B. Choubey D. Nallur G. Lengyel P. J.

More recently, the PYRIN domain, which is commonly found among cell death-associated proteins such as PYRIN, ASC, and zebra fish caspase and is also known as the PAAD/DAPIN domain, has been found in the N-terminal of IFI16, suggesting that IFI16 has a role in the apoptosis pathway (9Aravind L.

Presumably, IFI16 regulates the activity of certain transcription factors in the nucleus that are involved in the commitment to cell death. Recent studies have demonstrated that IFI16 is detected in the nuclei of lymphocytes in the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and palatine tonsil but is also found in epithelial cells in these tissues (14Wei W. Clarke C.J.P. Somers G.R. Cresswell K.S. Loveland K.A. Trapani J.A. Johnstone R.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Gariglio M. Azzimonti B.

Significantly, IFI16 protein was also expressed in non-lymphoid tissues, including trachea, gastrointestinal tract, skin, and testis. Thus, IFI16 expression is not restricted to cells of the immune system but is also found in epithelial cells. Given the selective expression of IFI16 in epithelial cells, it is likely that IFI16 may be important for some epithelial cell-specific functions. However, whether IFI16 expression is directly linked to human diseases remains to be determined. Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene occurs in more than half of all human cancers, indicating that loss of this gene represents a fundamentally important step in the pathogenesis of cancer (16Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). The p53 protein functions at least in part as a transcription factor and can transactivate cellular genes through sequence-specific binding to their promoters (17Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar, 18Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 19Prives C.

In the present study, we investigated a physiological function of IFI16 by means of si-RNA-mediated suppression of endogenous IFI16, adenovirus IFI16, and tetracycline-inducible IFI16 and found that IFI16 is involved in p53-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, immunohistochemical analysis of breast tissues demonstrated that expression of IFI16 is frequently lost in breast carcinoma, suggesting a role of this protein in malignant transformation. Taken together, our studies suggest that IFI16 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and that loss of IFI16 expression results in derailed regulation of p53-mediated apoptosis, leading to cancer development. Cell Culture—Primary human normal mammary epithelial cells were established from reduction mammoplasties obtained through the Cooperative Human Tissue Network and designated 12N, 15N, and 17N. These cells were grown in DFCI-1 medium (D-complete) and were used at early to mid-passage, i.e. 5-10 population doublings (20Band V. Zajchowski D. Kulesa V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). MCF7, MCF10A, T47D, U2OS, and MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from ATCC. MDAMB-361, -453, and -468 breast cancer cell lines were obtained from Dr. Stuart Aaronson at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Tetracycline-regulatable IFI16 in EJ human bladder carcinoma cells was established by following previously described protocols (21Lee S.W. Fang L. Igarashi M. Ouchi T. Lu K.-P. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8302-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). MCF10A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 medium supplemented with 2.5% horse serum, 0.02 μg/ml of epidermal growth factor, 0.5 μg/ml of hydrocortisone, 10 μg/ml of insulin, and 0.1 μg/ml of cholera toxin. Other cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-10% fetal bovine serum. EJtet cells were maintained in the presence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml). Ionizing radiation was administrated using a MARK2 IRRADIATOR (J. L. Stephen & Associate). Western Blotting Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with the addition of 100 mm NaF, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μg/ml polymethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Fifty micrograms of whole cell extract were loaded per lane by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Transfer to nitrocellulose was performed using a semidry transfer method (Trans-Blot; Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol (for 1.5 h at 15 V). After blocking with 1% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline/0.05% Tween 20, the primary antibody 1G7 for IFI16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline/1% nonfat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody was peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L; Jackson Immunoresearch) at 1:10,000 in 1% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline-T. Signals were developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies used in these studies are ATM (GeneTex); ATMSer1981 (Rockland); p53, Hdm2, p14ARF, and p21WAF1 (Calbiochem); p53Ser15 (Cell Signaling); p14ARF and Actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and BAX (BD Biosciences). Plasmids and Luciferase Assay—Full-length IFI16 cDNA was PCR-amplified using primers 5′-AAAGGATCCATGTCTGTAAAGATGGGAAAAAAATAC-3′ and 5′-AGCGGCCGCTTAGAAGAAAAAGTCTGGTGAAGTTTC-3′ from a HeLa cell cDNA library. An amplified fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. p53-pcDNA3 was described previously (22Aglipay J.A. Lee S.W. Okada S. Fujiuchi N. Ohtsuka T. Kwak J.C. Wang Y.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). Cells at ∼70% confluence in 60-mm plates were transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science), 1 μg of CAT reporter gene plasmid, 0.5 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid, and 2 μg of p53-pcDNA3 and/or IFI16-pcDNA3. After 48 h, transfected cells were resuspended in 50 μl of 0.25 m Tris (pH 7.8), subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min to obtain supernatants for measurements of CAT and β-galactosidase activity as described previously (24Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Adenovirus and Retrovirus—All adenoviral vectors were generated using the AdEasy System (kindly provided by B. Vogelstein). Briefly, Adp53 and Ad-IFI16 were constructed by subcloning wild type p53 and IFI16 cDNA into pAd-TRACK-CMV vector. After recombination with the wild type adenovirus DNA, all viruses were propagated, purified, and titrated. Adenovirus infections were carried out at multiplicity of infections at 10-50. Retrovirus-expressing human papilloma virus E6 protein was produced in Phoenix packaging cells with amphotropic envelope (kindly provided by G. Nolan, Stanford University) by transfecting with pZE67B (25Yutsudo M. Okamoto Y. Hakura A. Virology. 1988; 166: 594-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). MCF7 cells were infected with E6 virus and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-10% fetal bovine serum containing 700 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Northern Blot—Twenty micrograms of total RNA/sample were then denatured, subjected to electrophoresis through a 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel, and transferred by capillarity onto a nylon membrane. IFI16 and 36B4 probes were 32P-labeled using the random primed DNA labeling technique. Blots were exposed on x-ray film after washing. Immunohistochemical Analysis—Immunohistochemical studies were done using paraffin blocks of breast tissues provided from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network. Briefly, deparaffinized samples were treated with 1mMEDTA (pH8.0) and microwaved for 5 min. After blocking with horse serum buffer, 1G7 antibody (1:10 dilution), biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibody (Vector Lab) and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used for the detection of IFI16. si-RNA Assay—The following si-RNAs were generated by Dharmacon: 5′-GCUGGUCCUAACCAAACGU-3′ (IFI16 nucleotide 1106-1126). MCF10A cells were seeded at 30% density the day before transfection. Cells were transfected with OlgofectAMINE (Invitrogen) transfection reagent; 40 μl of si-RNA stock (20 μm) and 15 μl of OligofectAMINE were diluted with 650 or 350 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen), respectively. After 10 min at room temperature, they were combined and incubated for 30 min. Reaction mixtures were overlaid on cell culture for 24 h. Flow Cytometry—For cell cycle analysis of EJ-tetIFI16 cells, tetracycline-removal cells were infected with adenovirus for 24 h and treated with ionizing radiation (IR) 1The abbreviations used are: IR, ionizing radiation; NCS, neocarcinostatin; Gy, gray; CAT, chloramphenycol acetyltransferase; NCS, neocarcinostatin. (10 Gy) for 12 h. Cells undergoing apoptosis were analyzed using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Propidium iodide and Annexin V analyses were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Calbiochem). The results of both procedures were analyzed using FACSCalibur. Trypan Blue Exclusion and Giemsa Staining—For trypan blue exclusion assay, trypsinized cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5 ml of trypan blue solution (0.4% w/v) was added. After 5 min, cells were counted with a hemocytometer. For Giemsa staining, cells on the plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with Giemsa solution as described elsewhere (26Watkins S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. Greene and Wiley-Interscience, New York1993: 14.5.1-14.5.2Google Scholar). Frequent Loss of IFI16 Expression in Breast Cancer Cells—Previous studies have demonstrated that IFI16 is involved in tumor-suppressive functions of both p53 and BRCA1 proteins, suggesting the roles of IFI16 in cancer development (22Aglipay J.A. Lee S.W. Okada S. Fujiuchi N. Ohtsuka T. Kwak J.C. Wang Y. Johnstone R.W. Deng C.X. Qin J. Ouchi T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8931-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 27Johnstone R.W. Wei W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 40899-40904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We carried out an immunocytochemical analysis of IFI16 in human cancer and evaluated levels of IFI16 in breast cancer cell lines and mammary epithelial cells. Western and Northern blot analyses detected higher levels of IFI16 protein and mRNA in normal human mammary epithelial cells (12N, 15N, MCF10A), but most human breast cancer cell lines, including T47D, MCF7, 21PT, SKBR3, BT20, ZR75, and MDA-MB-468, -431, and -453 showed no level of expression (Fig. 1, A and B). Low-level protein expression was detected in such breast cancer cells as HCC1937, Hs578T, and 21MT2 (data not shown). These results indicate that expression of IFI16 is frequently lost in human breast cancer cells. Frequent Loss of IFI16 Protein in Mammary Epithelial Carcinoma—Previous immunohistochemical analysis has shown that IFI16 expression is not restricted to the hematopoietic compartment but may take place in some epithelial cells, such as those of trachea, spleen, and thymus; expression in mammary epithelial cells has not been studied (14Wei W. Clarke C.J.P. Somers G.R. Cresswell K.S. Loveland K.A. Trapani J.A. Johnstone R.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 119: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Gariglio M. Azzimonti B. Pagano M. Palestro G. Andrea M.D. Valente G. Voglino G. Navino L. Landolfo S. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2003; 22: 815-821Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To further understand IFI16 roles in mammary carcinogenesis, immunohistochemical analyses of IFI-16 expression was performed on breast tissue from 25 patients (12 carcinomas, 10 normal samples, 3 benign lesions (fibroadenomas)); 5 matched normal and tumor samples were included. Normal mammary epithelium expressed nuclear IFI16 moderately to strongly; cytoplasmic expression, though variable, tended to be weaker than nuclear expression (Fig. 2, a and c). Autologous carcinoma cells showed negative or only weakly positive nuclei but weak to moderate cytoplasmic expression. (Fig. 2b). In this regard, benign fibroadenoma was like normal epithelial cells (Fig. 2d); other carcinoma samples showed reduced IFI16 expression (Fig. 2, e and f). Thus, the IFI16 expression pattern differs in benign versus malignant breast epithelial cells, demonstrating loss of IFI16 from the nucleus in carcinoma cells. Accordingly, IFI16 may play a role in the normal mammary epithelial cell phenotype, but IFI16 function is lost in malignancy. Loss of IFI16 Results in Reduced p53 Activation by Ionizing Radiation—We studied whether IFI16 is required for the maximal activation of p53 under conditions of DNA damage, because IFI16 is involved in p53-mediated regulation of transcription (22Aglipay J.A.

Transfection of MCF10A cells with si-RNA specific for down-regulation of the IFI16 gene resulted in significant reduction of IFI16 protein 48 h after transfection compared with the control si-RNA (Fig. 3, top). Cells were treated with ionizing radiation (10 Gy, time 0), and cell lysates were prepared at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12 h after IR treatment. Recent studies have revealed that phosphorylation of ATMSer1981 is crucial for the activation of the catalytic activity of ATM when cells are damaged by IR (29Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-1981 was similarly induced in both control MCF10A cells and cells in which IFI16 is reduced, indicating that ATM activation by IR damage is not affected by loss of IFI16. Previous results have demonstrated that phosphorylation of p53Ser15 by ATM protein kinase results in increased stability of p53 (17Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Consistent with the increased phosphorylation of ATM upon IR treatment, induction of both protein levels and phosphorylation of Ser-15 of p53 was similar in control and IFI16-reduced cells. After 6 h in IFI16-reduced cells, protein levels of p53 and phosphorylation of p53Ser15 were decreased, whereas they were sustained in control cells for ∼12 h. It has been demonstrated that p14ARF inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 degradation by sequestering MDM2 from p53 (30Sherr C.J. Weber J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 3689-3695Crossref Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In MCF10A cells transfected with IFI16 si-RNA, p14ARF was transiently decreased in 2∼4 h after IR treatment, and levels of Hdm2 (human MDM2) were slightly higher in IFI16-si-RNA cells. Reduced activation of p53 by the loss of IFI16 was further studied in U2OS, human osteosarcoma cell line (Fig. 3, bottom). Levels of IFI16 were decreased by si-RNA, and cells were treated with IR (10 Gy). Although activation of ATM by IR was not affected by loss of IFI16, it slightly decreased in 6 h after IR treatment. Phosphorylation of p53Ser15 was weaker and levels of p53 were lower in cells in which IFI16 was decreased compared with control U2OS cells. These results demonstrate that loss of IFI16 results in lower p53 activation under conditions of DNA damage. IFI16 Enhances p53-mediated Apoptosis—Previous results demonstrated that the reporter construct containing the p53-binding element and the CAT gene is enhanced by ectopic expression of p53 and IFI16 (27Johnstone R.W. Wei W. Greenway A. Trapani J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6033-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To elucidate the physiological roles of IFI16 in p53-mediated regulation of cell proliferation, we studied whether IFI16 can stimulate endogenous p53 activated by DNA damage. MCF7 cells expressing wild type p53 were transfected with the minimal reporter plasmid PGluc, which contained two copies of p53 binding sites cloned upstream of the luciferase gene (31Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and reporter activity was examined with or without IFI16 under conditions of IR (10 Gy) treatment (Fig. 4A). IFI16 transfection and IR treatment activated PGluc ∼3- and ∼11-fold, respectively. When IFI16-transfected cells were irradiated, PGluc showed ∼19-fold induction. These results suggest that IFI16 is involved in the p53-mediated DNA damage pathway. Next, we examined the biological activity of IFI16 by infecting MCF7 cells with adenovirus IFI16 under DNA damage (Fig. 4B). Subconfluent MCF7 cells were infected with GFP-(Ad-TRACK) or IFI16-(Ad-IFI16) adenovirus for 24 h and then subjected to DNA damage with neocarcinostatin (NCS). After 12 h, flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V staining was performed to study the apoptosis fraction counted in the lower-right quadrants of each panel. Whereas AdTRACK induced apoptosis with NCS treatment (from 3.82 to 9.42%), AdIFI16 alone induced significant apoptosis (24.4%), which was enhanced by NCS treatment (36.0%). These results suggest that IFI16 can potentially induce apoptosis. After induction of apoptosis of MCF7 cells infected with Ad-IFI16, the remaining cells did not grow as quickly as the control MCF7 cells infected with Ad-TRACK virus. It has been shown that human papilloma virus protein E6 induces p53 degradation through the ubiquitin pathway (32Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5019-5022PubMed Google Scholar). We studied apoptosis of MCF7 cells and MCF7-E6 cells that stably express retrovirus E6 to clarify the collaboration of IFI16 and p53 in p53-mediated DNA damage pathway in breast cancer cells (25Yutsudo M. Okamoto Y. Hakura A. Virology. 1988; 166: 594-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Reduced levels of p53 in MCF7-E6 cells were confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4C). Both cell types (5 × 105 cells) were infected with Ad-TRACK or Ad-IFI16 and treated with NCS as described in Fig. 4B. After 12 h of NCS treatment, cell viability was studied by trypan blue staining (Fig. 4D, left). Consistent with results shown in Fig. 4B, MCF7 cells expressing IFI16 showed reduced viability (about 48% reduction) when treated with NCS compared with NCS alone or Ad-IFI16 alone (∼20 and ∼25% reduction, respectively). Significant reduction of cell viability was not observed in MCF7-E6 cells. Cell survival was further studied by Giemsa staining. MCF7 and MCF-E6 cells (1 × 106 cells) were infected with Ad-TRACK or Ad-IFI16 as described. After adenovirus infection, cells were maintained for 7 days in the presence of NCS. Cells were stained with Giemsa and survived colonies were counted (Fig. 4D, right). MCF7 cells treated with Ad-TRACK, Ad-IFI16, or AD-TRACK plus NCS showed similar numbers of colonies (∼180-190 colonies); however, Ad-IFI16 plus NCS treatment markedly reduced the numbers of colonies (∼60 colonies). Decreased cell survival was not observed in MCF7-E6 cells. IFI16 induction of apoptosis was further examined by means of tetracycline-regulatable IFI16 in human bladder carcinoma EJ cells (Fig. 4E), which do not express endogenous p53. When tetracycline was removed, cells were infected with Ad-TRACK or Ad-p53 for 24 h followed by IR treatment (10 Gy). Cells undergoing apoptosis were studied with Annexin V staining as described above. As shown in Fig. 4F, Ad-p53 alone or Ad-p53 plus IR treatment did not induce apoptosis without IFI16 induction (2.5 and 3.8%, respectively). When IFI16 was induced, weak induction of apoptosis by Ad-p53 (4.2%) was strongly enhanced by IR treatment (29%). Ad-TRACK did not induce apoptosis in IFI16-induced or -uninduced cells. Expression of p53 and IFI16 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4D, bottom). Taken together, these results demonstrate that IFI16 is involved in the p53-mediated apoptosis pathway induced by DNA damage. IFI16 Enhances Expression of p53 Target Proteins—Increasing numbers of apoptosis- and cell cycle-related genes that are transcriptionally regulated by p53 have been identified. These are candidates for implementing p53 effector functions. Because our results suggest that IFI16 is involved in apoptosis pathway mediated by p53, we examined whether IFI16 affects p53-induced expression of the target proteins. A Bcl-2 family member, BAX, is a transcriptional target of p53 and one of the well characterized proapoptosis proteins (23Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar, 24Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To study the activity of IFI16 in p53-mediated gene expression, we examined bax promoter activation by coexpressing p53 and IFI16 (Fig. 5). MCF7 cells were transfected with p53 and/or IFI16 together with the reporter gene containing 370 bp of the human bax promoter subcloned upstream of the CAT gene (24Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). IFI16 and p53 alone activated the bax promoter ∼3- and 8-fold, respectively. When both proteins were coexpressed, promoter activity was enhanced up to 17-fold. Immunoblot analysis indicated that MCF7 cells express an undetectable level of endogenous IFI16 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 5, lower panel) and confirmed increased levels of p53 when cells were transfected with p53 (Fig. 5, lower panel). Consistent with the results showing the collaboration of p53 and IFI16 in transcription, endogenous levels of BAX, p21WAF1, and HDM2 were synergistically induced by expressing both proteins. These results demonstrate that IFI16 enhances expression of p53 target proteins. In this study, we first evaluated the distribution of IFI16 immunohistochemically in 25 breast tissues. Although IFI16 was originally isolated from mRNA of a lymphocyte cell culture and is highly expressed in lymphocytes, our results showing that strong nuclear staining of IFI16 is also detected in breast epithelial cells demonstrate that expression of IFI16 is not restricted to cells of the immune system. It is noteworthy that expression levels of IFI16 are also reduced in 6 of 18 pancreatic cancer cell lines examined, suggesting that the loss of IFI16 is associated not only with breast cancer development but also pancreatic cancer. 2N. Maehara, F. Sahin, and G. H. Su, manuscript in preparation. Gene silencing that arises from methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism of gene inactivation (33Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Trends Genet. 1998; 16: 168-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1388) Google Scholar, 34Robertson K.D. Jones P.A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Methylated CpGs are recognized by proteins that recruit histone deacetylases, leading to stable transcriptional repression, which can often be reversed by the methylation inhibitor 5aza2dC (5azaC, Ref. 35Bird A.P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). To determine whether IFI16 is repressed by methylation, breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDAMB468, MDAMB431, and MDAMB453) were treated with 5 mm 5azaC for 2-3 population doublings and IFI16 expression was examined. Only in several cell lines did 5azaC produce a 3-5 fold increase in IFI16 protein (not shown). Although this indicates that transcriptional silencing by methylation may contribute to IFI16 inactivation in subsets of breast cancer, it is also possible that a transactivating regulator of IFI16 may be modulated by methylation or that methylation affects an enhancer or other regulatory element outside the IFI16 promoter because CpG islands could not be identified in ∼1.7 kb of the IFI16 promoter upstream from the transcriptional starting site (GenBank™ accession number NT_079484). Further studies are in progress using methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. Previous studies have demonstrated that IFI16 physically binds to and activates p53 in the reporter activation assay (27Johnstone R.W. Wei W. Greenway A. Trapani J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6033-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our current studies reinforce the hypothesis that IFI16 is involved in p53-mediated transmission of apoptosis signaling under conditions of DNA damage. We studied tetracycline-regulatable IFI16 and adenovirus p53 in the p53-deficient human bladder carcinoma cell line, EJ, and in MCF7 cells, respectively, to clarify the functional collaboration between IFI16 and p53. It is noteworthy that increased expression of p53 in EJ cells has been shown to result in permanent growth arrest with the senescence marker, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (21Lee S.W. Fang L. Igarashi M. Ouchi T. Lu K.-P. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8302-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Expression of IFI16 in these cells, however, showed apoptosis when expressed with p53 under IR treatment, suggesting that IFI16 may play a role in commitment to growth arrest or apoptosis. Although our results indicate that IFI16 induces apoptosis with IR or NCS treatment, it remains to be clarified whether proapoptosis activity of IFI16 is specific to a certain type of DNA damage. We are currently studying proapoptosis activity of IFI16 under different conditions of DNA damage. More recently, we have found that loss of IFI16 resulted in accumulation of p53, leading to accumulation of p21WAF1 and growth suppression without DNA damage (28Kwak J.C. Ongusaha P.P. Ouchi T. Lee S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40899-40904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results and our current studies suggest a model that IFI16 is required for the immediate activation of p53 under conditions of DNA damage and that loss of IFI16 provides a stress to cells that also causes p53 activation. Although the mechanism of p53 activation induced by loss of IFI16 remains to be elucidated, Hdm2 might induce degradation of p53 when p14ARF is transiently reduced (Fig. 3). Considering our findings in the whole, it is possible that functional interaction between p53 and IFI16 is relevant to p53 signaling and to breast cancer. This model is reinforced by an observation showing increased apoptosis induced by DNA damage in cells expressing IFI16. Given that AIM2, a member of the PYRIN family of the protein, is a tumor-suppressor protein of human melanoma (36De Young K.L. Ray M.E. Su Y.A. Anzick S.L. Johnstone R.W. Trapani J.A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), loss of apoptosis regulation by IFI16 is likely closely associated with tumor malignancy. We thank Michael Meyer and members of the Ouchi laboratory for critical discussion of the results."

We report here that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from individuals with the CX3CR1-IM haplotype adhered more potently to membrane-bound CX3CL1 than did PBMC from homozygous CX3CR1-VT donors. Similar excess adhesion was observed with CX3CR1-IM-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell lines tested with two different methods: the parallel plate laminar flow chamber and the dual pipette aspiration technique. Suppression of the extra adhesion in the presence of pertussis toxin indicates that G-protein mediated the underlying transduction pathway, in contrast to the G-protein-independent adhesion previously described for CX3CR1-VT. Surprisingly, HEK and PBMC that expressed CX3CR1-IM and -VT were indistinguishable when tested with the soluble form of CX3CL1 for chemotaxis, calcium release, and binding capacity. In conclusion, only the membrane-anchored form of CX3CL1 functionally discriminated between these two allelic isoforms of CX3CR1. These results suggest that each form of this ligand may lead to a different signaling pathway. The extra adhesion of CX3CR1-IM may be related to immune defenses and to atherogenesis, both of which depend substantially on adhesive intercellular events.

The causal mechanism of these effects remains unclear. Previous studies, including ours, have hypothesized that the mutation might decrease the affinity of CX3CL1 to its receptor (18Faure S. Meyer L.

Moreover the CX3CR1-Ile249 variant has repeatedly been found to be expressed less often by PBMC than is CX3CR1-Val249 (18Faure S. Meyer L. Costagliola D. Vaneensberghe C. Genin E. Autran B.

We show here that the situation is more complex. We investigated possible differences in the molecular properties of these variants and found that, although they responded similarly to soluble CX3CL1, they behaved very differently as adhesion molecules. Surprisingly, the mutated Ile249 CX3CR1 genotype was associated with enhanced adhesiveness. CX3CR1 Variant Constructs—Open reading frames corresponding to CX3CR1-Val249–Thr280 (CX3CR1-VT) and CX3CR1-Ile249–Met280 (CX3CR1-IM) were amplified from genomic DNA prepared from PBMC from two healthy donors with the corresponding genotypes. To do that, we used HindIII-tailed forward primer (LT5-CX3CR1, GCGCATATAAGCTTGCCACCATGGATCAGTTCCCTGAATCAG) and XhoI-tailed reverse primer (LT3-CX3CR1, GCGGATATGTCGACCTCGAGTCACGAGTCAGAGAAGGAGCAA). The PCR-cycling conditions were 95 °C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR product was then digested with HindIII and XhoI (Promega, Charbonnières, France), subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France), and then sequenced on both strands with the BigDye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). To generate stably transfected clones, we used Transfast (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. We transfected 106 HEK cells in 3-cm dishes with 2 μg of each pcDNA3.1 construct (Invitrogen) with CX3CR1 inserts encoding the CX3CR1 variant gene. Clones were derived by selection in 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The clones thus obtained were assayed for CX3CL1 binding, and those expressing high levels of CX3CR1 were selected for further study. The clones were maintained in DMEM medium containing G418 and were checked with CX3CL1 binding for CX3CR1 expression before each experiment. To obtain transiently transfected HEK cells, we used JetPei™ (cationic polymer transfection reagent, Qbiogene, Illkirch, France) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. We used 3 μg of each pcDNA3.1 construct to transfect 4 × 105 HEK cells in a 6-well plate. After 2 days, transfected cells were resuspended by incubation with PBS for 30 min at 37 °C and were checked with CX3CL1 binding for CX3CR1 expression before use. For CX3CL1 transfection in HEK, we used pBlast plasmid (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France) with a CX3CL1 insert or with no insert. For stable expression, clones were derived by selection in 5 μg/ml blasticidin (Euromedex, Mundolsheim, France) for at least 1 month. The clones thus obtained were assayed for CX3CL1 staining by flow cytometry, and those expressing high levels of CX3CL1 were selected for further study. The clones were maintained in DMEM medium containing blasticidin and were checked before each experiment for CX3CL1 expression by flow cytometry. PBMC were isolated from heparinized venous blood from healthy volunteers by one-step centrifugation on a Ficoll-separating solution (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany). Flow Cytometry—The cells (105 PBMC or 2.5 × 105 HEK) were tested for CX3CR1 expression by flow cytometry after staining by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CX3CR1 monoclonal antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). As a control, the cells were incubated without any antibody. We verified that this produced the same signal as an isotype antibody control. The different PBMC subsets were quantified sequentially, in 2 ways: first, by discriminating lymphocytes and monocytes according to their width and granulometry (SSC versus FSC diagram), and second, by staining with various antibodies as follows. The lymphocytes (CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+) and the NK cells (CD4-, CD8low, CD16+, CD56+) were analyzed with FITC-anti-CD3, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD16 plus anti-CD56, and AlloPhycoCyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD4 or anti-CD8. The monocytes (CD3-, CD4 low, CD8-, CD14+) were analyzed with FITC-anti-CD4, PE anti-CD14, APC anti-CD8, and peridinin chlorophyll A protein (PerCP) anti-CD3. All antibodies were from BD Biosciences (Le Pont de Claix, France). FACScalibur™ performed fluorescent analysis with CellQuestPro™ software (BD Biosciences). 125I-CX3CL1 Binding Assay—PBMC (106 cells per sample) or HEK cells (2 × 105 or 2 × 106 cells per sample, for stable clones or transiently transfected cells, respectively) were washed in PBS and suspended in 200 μl of PBS containing 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V, Sigma) and 0.005% azide with 50 pm 125I-CX3CL1 (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence or absence of 50 nm unlabeled human CX3CL1 (TEBU, Le Perray en Yvelines, France). After 2 h at 37 °C, unbound chemokines were separated from cells by centrifugation in 1 ml of PBS supplemented with 10% sucrose. Gamma emissions were then counted in the cell pellet. For association studies, cells were incubated with 50 pm 25I-CX3CL1 under the same conditions as above (PBS+BSA+azide, 37 °C) for increasing periods of time and washed. Calcium Response Assay—Intracytoplasmic free calcium was measured with Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands). HEK cells (3 × 106) were washed once and loaded for 45 min at 37 °C, in the dark, with 2 μm Fura-2/AM and 2 μm pluronic acid in 1 ml of HBSS buffer supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of the same buffer and transferred to a quartz cuvette for reading. CX3CL1 was added to the cell volume at various concentrations. Fluorescence was monitored with a SAFAS spectrofluorometer (SAFAS S.A., Monaco) in cuvettes thermostatically controlled at 37 °C and stirred continuously. The cell suspension was excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm and fluorescence measured at 510 nm. 10-nm slit widths were used for both excitation and emission. Graphic representation of intracellular calcium concentrations were computed with Equation 1, [Ca++]=225×R/(Rmax−R)×Sf380/Sb380(Eq. 1) which was previously determined by Grynkiewicz (30Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), with R the ratio of the fluorescence measured at the 340 and 380 nm excitations. Rmax was evaluated by lysing the cells with 0.5% Triton X-100, and Rmin determined by adding the excess EGTA. Sb380 and Sf380 were the fluorescence levels at 380-nm excitation, both determined under the same conditions. Chemotactic Migration Assay—Chemotaxis was assayed in a 96-well chemotaxis chamber with a filter porosity of 10 μm (NeuroProbe, Cabin John, MD) for HEK cells and 5 μm for PBMC. The cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5 mg/ml BSA, then labeled for 30 min at 37 °C with 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) in RPMI 1640. Cells were then washed in PBS and resuspended in HBSS buffer supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2 (106 cells/ml). 80 μl of this cell suspension was loaded onto the filter. A final volume of 28 μl of medium with various concentrations of CX3CL1 was placed in the lower chamber. The 96-well plate was then incubated for 2–3 h at 37 °C, 100% humidity, and 5% CO2. The filter top surface was rinsed with PBS, and the plate centrifuged for 2 min at 1500 rpm. Fluorescence was measured with a Packard Fusion microplate analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Parallel Plate Laminar Flow Chamber Adhesion Assay—Adhesion experiments used the parallel plate flow technique and the chamber previously described (31Pierres A. Feracci H. Delmas V. Benoliel A.M. Thiery J.P. Bongrand P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9256-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The coverslips we used were either cultured with adherent HEK cells (HEK-pBlast or HEK-FKN clones) or coated with CX3CL1 (Fig. 1C), as follows: the coverslip was coated with 10 μl of anti-His6 antibody (25 μg/ml in PBS plus 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed in PBS, coated with 10 μl of 100 nm CX3CL1-His6 (RnD Systems, Lille, France) for 1 h at 37 °C, and then coated with saturating solution (PBS plus 3 mg/ml BSA and 50 mg/ml sucrose) for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslip was pressed by a screwed steel plate against a drilled plexiglass block that contained a cavity measuring 0.1 × 8 × 20 mm3 surrounded by a toric gasket (Satim, Evenos, France). The chamber was set on the stage of an inverted microscope (TE300, Nikon, France) equipped with a phase contrast 10× objective (Nikon, n.a. 0.25) and a cooled CCD camera (Sensicam, PCO, Kelheim, Germany). HEK-CX3CR1 clone cells or PBMC were suspended in PBS, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 μm 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes), for labeling and resuspended in flow buffer (HBSS supplemented with 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mg/ml BSA) at 106 cells per ml for HEK clones and at 4 × 106 cells per ml for transiently transfected HEK and PBMC. For the tests assessing the impact of divalent cations, the buffer contained 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2 rather than EGTA or EDTA. A syringe pump (PHD 2000; Harvard Apparatus, Les Ulis, France) drove 0.5 ml of cell suspension through the chamber at a wall shear stress of 1.5 dynes·cm–2. The buffer was warmed to 37 °C before the syringes were filled and maintained at 37 °C by plunging the tubing into a thermostatically controlled bath. After a 10-min wash at 1.5 dynes·cm–2, fluorescent images of two separate 0.5 mm2 fields were recorded to count the adherent cells (excitation 450–500 nm, emission 510–560 nm, dichroic filter Q505lp, Chroma, Brattleboro, VT). The shear stress was then set at 15 dynes·cm–2 for 5 min, 75 dynes·cm–2 for 2 min, and finally 150 dynes·cm–2 for 2 min. The adherent cells were counted at each step. The number of cells was expressed as the mean of the count of the two 0.5 mm2 fields. The number of adherent PBMC cells was expressed as the percentage of the total number of CX3CR1+ injected cells, evaluated by flow cytometry with a CX3CR1-specific monoclonal antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). Specific adhesion was obtained by subtracting the number of cells adhering to the HEK-pBlast coverslip from the number adhering to the HEK-CX3CR1. The results were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of four or more measurements. Dual Pipette Aspiration Technique—The dual pipette adhesion assay was performed on the stage of a Leica inverted microscope, positioned on an anti-vibration platform with a digitally controlled thermostat and equipped with ×10 and ×63 objectives. The incubation chamber consisted of the bottom of a 90-mm Petri dish covered with the inverted bottom of a second dish of the same size. All surfaces in contact with the cells were precoated with BSA, inactivated for 3 min at 80 °C (3 mg/ml). Before the assay, the chamber was loaded with CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 2.5 mm EGTA, and 2.5 mm EDTA. To obtain an inner diameter of between 4.0 and 5.5 μm, we pulled (with a Sutter instrument, model P-2000), cut, and then fire-polished micropipettes with a homemade microforge. Before the adhesion assay, pipettes were filled with sterile isotonic sucrose solution (300–330 mosm) and preincubated in BSA. Cells were manipulated with two micropipettes, each held in its own micromanipulator and connected to a combined hydraulic/pneumatic system that provided the necessary control of the aspiration force applied to the cells. The protocol we used is very similar to that of Chien and co-workers (32Sung K.L. Sung L.A. Crimmins M. Burakoff S.J. Chien S. Science. 1986; 234: 1405-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Two cells, collected by gentle aspiration onto the tip of each pipette (cell number 1 in pipette A, cell 2 in pipette B), were brought into contact through the use of the micromanipulators and allowed to remain in contact for different periods of time (Fig. 3C, 2–30 min). To separate the cells, aspiration in pipette B was maintained at a level sufficiently high to hold cell number 2 tightly, while the aspiration in pipette A was increased in steps measured with a pressure sensor (Validyne: model DP103–38; ranging from 0 to 50,000 Pascal units). After each step, the pipettes were moved apart in an effort to detach the adherent cells from one another. A pair pulled intact from pipette A was moved back to the pipette orifice, the aspiration in the pipette was increased, and another attempt was made to detach the cells from each other. The cycle was repeated until the level of aspiration in pipette A was sufficient to pull one cell apart from the other. The aspiration employed in each cycle was monitored continuously. In most cases, cell deformation and contact area variation during the separation process were very limited (less than 20% for the contact area), and the separation took place suddenly, in less than a tenth of a second. The cells appeared to behave more like rigid structures than like two adhering deformable capsules. The usual approach (33Tozeren A. Sung K.L. Chien S. Biophys. J. 1989; 55: 479-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Evans E. Berk D. Leung A. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 838-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) of measuring contact angles at the end of the pipette and at the edge of the contact thus did not seem useful. The separation force (F) for rigid structures can be deduced from the data. 2Y.-S. Chu, S. Dufour, J. P. Thiery, E. Perez, and F. Pincet, submitted manuscript. The values recorded for each of the last two cycles in the series (Pn–1 and Pn) were used to calculate F for the pair tested, with Equation 2, F=π(d/2)2(Pn−1+Pn)/2(Eq. 2) with d the internal diameter of pipette A. This relation assumes that the pressure inside the cell is the same as that in the chamber; valid in our case since the tension of the cell is essentially zero. The results were expressed as mean ± S.E. for 13 or more measurements. Western Blot Analysis of p44/42 MAP Kinase Phosphorylation— HEK cells were starved for 18 h in DMEM without SVF and suspended at 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1 mm HEPES and 1 mg/ml BSA. After addition of 50 nm CX3CL1 for the indicated time, the samples (106 cells) were washed in 1 ml of PBS at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of Tris, 20 mm, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA 1 mm orthovanadate, 25 mm NaF, 5 mm pyrophosphate (Sigma), and 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor from Roche Applied Science for 30 min at 4 °C. Nuclear and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10 000 × g. The samples were then assayed for protein content, diluted in sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue) and heated for 3 min at 95 °C. Proteins were separated by standard SDS-PAGE. Gels were electrotransferred to Hybond-P nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and the blots probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/Tyr204) or p44/42 MAP kinase (Cell Signaling, New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. For detection, we used horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, on Curix Blue x-ray film (Agfa, Mortsel, Belgium). LY-294002 and PD-98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone) were purchased from New England Biolabs and Biomol, respectively.

Upon duplex DNA binding, the N terminus of the beta' subunit (amino acids 1 to 314) and amino acids 94 to 507 of the sigma subunit, together comprising less than one-fifth of RNAP holoenzyme, were able to melt an extended -10 promoter in a reaction remarkably similar to that of authentic holoenzyme.

Cryptdins kill microbes by forming pores in their limiting membranes. The cryptdin isoforms 2 and 3 also can form anion-conductive pores in eukaryotic cell membranes, thus affecting cell physiology. Here, we find that when applied to apical membranes of the human intestinal cell line T84, cryptdin 3 (Cr3) induces secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 8 (IL-8) in a dose-dependent manner. The induction of IL-8 secretion is specific to the cryptdins that form channels in mammalian cell membranes because cryptdin 4, which does not form pores in T84 cells, does not induce IL-8 secretion. Cr3 induces inflammatory cytokine secretion by activating NF-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in a Ca2+-dependent manner, but influx by extra-cellular Ca2+ is not involved. Unlike other known inflammatory agonists, signal transduction by Cr3 occurs slowly, suggesting a novel mechanism of action.

We also find that certain cryptdins, cryptdins 2 and 3, can form apical anion-conductive channels in eukaryotic cell membranes. The formation of such channels in the apical membrane of crypt epithelial cells causes a salt and water secretory response that flushes the intestinal crypt of noxious agents (10Lencer W.I. Cheung G.

Crypt epithelial cells may further contribute to innate intestinal host defense by orchestrating the recruitment of immune cells via the secretion of chemokines into the lamina propria, such as the neutrophil chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8). 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; Cr3, cryptdin 3; Cr4, cryptdin 4; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester; HBSS, Hanks' buffered saline solution; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MIP, macrophage inhibitory protein. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; Cr3, cryptdin 3; Cr4, cryptdin 4; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester; HBSS, Hanks' buffered saline solution; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MIP, macrophage inhibitory protein. IL-8 secretion initiates the first step in neutrophil recruitment into the mucosa and ultimately in the formation of the crypt abscess, which represents the hallmark of acute and chronic intestinal inflammation. Although Paneth cells respond to microbial pathogens by discharging their granule contents, it is not known whether the Paneth cell or the secreted cryptdins function as intrinsic components of the intestinal inflammatory response.Pore formation in eukaryotic cells by a variety of agents causes many biological effects including cytokine release (11Bhakdi S.

In some cell types, however, staphylococcal α-toxin forms a pore that conducts only monovalent ions, but it still can induce release of the cytokine IL-1β or the induction of apoptosis (11Bhakdi S.

The activity is specific to the pore-forming activity of Cr3 in mammalian cell membranes because cryptdin 4 (Cr4) that does not form ion-conducting pores in T84 cells fails to induce an inflammatory response. Unlike most other pore-forming agonists, however, Cr3 does not act by inducing an influx of extracellular Ca2+. Signal transduction occurs through activation of NF-κB and MAPK, but the time course of activation and transcription is very slow. These results suggest that certain cryptdins may act in vivo via a novel mechanism of paracrine signal transduction to amplify their role in innate immunity by coordinating the antimicrobial activities of Paneth cell secretions with the induction of an intestinal inflammatory response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell and Bacterial Culture—T84 cells, an intestinal cell line originally obtained from metastatic human colorectal carcinoma, were used to model intestinal epithelia. Confluent monolayers of T84 cells were grown on collagen-coated inserts (Costar Corning, Cambridge, MA) as described previously (18Dharmsathaphorn K. Madara J.L.

Briefly, T84 cells on 0.33-cm2 inserts were washed and incubated in 50 μl of apical and 300 μl of basolateral HBSS (unless otherwise indicated) for at least 10 min. Appropriate agonists were added for 5 h and then basolateral solutions were collected for IL-8 measurement.Drug Treatments—To chelate intracellular Ca2+, T84 cells were treated with 30 μm BAPTA-AM (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) for 45 min before agonist addition in HBSS with reduced Ca2+ as described previously (24Gewirtz A.T.

To chelate extracellular Ca2+, T84 cells were treated with 10 mm EGTA (Sigma) 1 h prior to agonist addition. Recombinant TNF-α (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), carbachol, and ionomycin (Sigma) were added as described in the figure legends.Western Blot Analysis—After experimental treatment, T84 cells (0.33 cm2) were washed in ice-cold HBSS. Then cells were harvested, and whole cell extracts were prepared by removing the cell-coated filters and placing them directly into SDS loading buffer for rapid lysis. Lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using antiphospho-IκB-α (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-IκB-α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA), and anti-p38 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). Because phospho-IκB-α is rapidly degraded in vivo, we pretreated monolayers analyzed for phospho-IκB-α with the cell-permeant proteasome inhibitor MG-262 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.). p65 Immunostaining—Following experimental treatment, T84 cells were fixed and immunostained for the p65 subunit of NF-κB as described previously (25Neish A.S.

Total RNA was reverse transcribed from random hexamer primers using Multiscribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis (SYBR Green real-time PCR assay, Applied Biosystems) was performed on the reverse transcription cDNA products using primers for IL-8 (Primer Express software, Applied Biosystems) and 18 S ribosomal RNA (Taqman ribosomal RNA control reagents kit, Applied Biosystems) as described previously (26Collier-Hyams L.S.

IL-8 expression level was normalized to the 18 S rRNA level of the same sample. Fold difference was the ratio of the normalized value of each sample to that of untreated control cells. (IL-8 primer sequences are: forward, 5′-aaaccaccggaaggaaccat; reverse, 5′-gccacgttggaagtcatgt.)RayBio™ Inflammation Antibody Array Analysis—After 5 h agonist treatment, the basolateral-conditioned media from stimulated T84 cells (0.33 cm2, 4 inserts per condition) was isolated and assessed for cytokine secretion. Antibody array membranes were incubated in the conditioned media, and cytokines were detected per the manufacturer's guidelines (inflammation antibody array III, Ray Biotech, Inc., Norcross, GA).Statistical Methods—Data were analyzed for significance by Student's t test.RESULTSCr3 Induces IL-8 Secretion from T84 Cells—To test whether certain cryptdins may participate differentially in an in vitro intestinal inflammatory response, we utilized the human intestinal cell line T84 and purified refolded synthetic or recombinant mouse Cr3 and Cr4. The inflammatory response was assessed by immunoassay for IL-8 secretion. When applied to apical membranes of T84 cells, Cr3 induced IL-8 secretion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a, first through third columns). The IL-8 secretory response induced by Cr3 is comparable to that induced by the proinflammatory apical agonist S. typhimurium (Fig. 1a, compare third and fourth columns). Because pore-forming toxins and complement also induce cytokine secretion from target cells, we tested whether signal transduction by Cr3 depended on the ability of Cr3 to form anion-conductive channels in eukaryotic cell membranes. Consistent with this idea, Cr4, which cannot form pores in T84 cells (10Lencer W.I. Cheung G. Strohmeier G.R. Currie M. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8585-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), had no effect on IL-8 secretion (Fig. 1b, second column). In contrast, both Cr3 and the proinflammatory basolateral agonist TNF-α induced robust IL-8 secretory responses of comparable magnitudes (Fig. 1b, third and fourth columns). These results show that Cr3 can act apically to induce IL-8 cytokine secretion from T84 intestinal cells and suggest that the mechanism of action may require channel formation in the apical membrane.Cr3 Induces IL-8 Secretion via Activation of the Transcription Factor NF-κB and MAPK—To examine the mechanism of signal transduction by Cr3, we tested for the induction of phospho-IκB-α by immunoblot (Fig. 2a). Phospho-IκB-α was first detected after 2 h of incubation with Cr3 (Fig. 2a, lane 3) and increased with time (compare lanes 1–4). In contrast, the inflammatory agonist TNF-α applied to basolateral membranes of T84 cells induced phosphorylation of IκB-α within 5 min (Fig. 2a, lane 5). This study shows that Cr3 acts via the apical membrane of intestinal cells to induce phosphorylation of IκB-α, but the time course of activation was slow compared with the classic inflammatory cytokine TNF-α.Fig. 2Cr3 induces phosphorylation of IκB-α and NF-κB nuclear translocation. a, Western blot analysis of phospho-IκB-α levels in T84 cells stimulated with apical Cr3 (100 μg/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml), or buffer alone at the indicated time points. Equal loading was confirmed by assessment of total IκB-α levels. b–g, immunostaining for the p65 unit of NF-κB in T84 cells. b, unstimulated cells demonstrating cytoplasmic NF-κB staining. c, cells demonstrating nuclear NF-κB staining after 1 h of TNF-α stimulation. c–g, cells demonstrating increasing nuclear NF-κB staining after 1, 2, 3, and 4 h of Cr3 stimulation, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next we tested whether Cr3 induced the translocation of NF-κB from the cytosol to the nucleus as would be predicted for an inflammatory agonist acting via the phosphorylation of IκB-α. Translocation of NF-κB from the cytosol to the nucleus in T84 cells was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy for the p65 subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 2, b–g). Unstimulated cells had cytoplasmic staining but no nuclear staining for the p65 subunit (Fig. 2b). In cells treated basolaterally with TNF-α, p65 was readily visualized inside the nucleus 1 h after application of the agonist (Fig. 2c). In cells treated apically with Cr3, the p65 subunit also was visualized inside the nucleus, but translocation to the nucleus was first visualized only 3–4 h after addition of Cr3 (Fig. 2, d–g). These data are consistent with the slower time course of IκB-α phosphorylation induced by Cr3 and confirm that Cr3 acts as an inflammatory agonist via the transcription factor NF-κB.To determine whether Cr3 may also act via activation of p38 MAPK, we tested for agonist-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK by immunoblot (Fig. 3). Cr3 causes phosphorylation of p38 that was first observed 30 min after application to T84 cells and peaked at 2 h (Fig. 3, lanes 1–6). In contrast, Cr4, which does not form pores in T84 cells, had no effect (lanes 13–18). Like Cr3, TNF-α also induced an increase in phospho-p38, but the phosphorylation occurred more rapidly with peak levels observed at 30 min (lanes 7–12).Fig. 3Cr3 induces activation of p38 MAPK. Western blot analysis of phospho-p38 levels in T84 cells stimulated with Cr3 (100 μg/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml), or Cr4 (100 μg/ml) at the indicated time points. Equal loading was confirmed by assessment of total p38 on each Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm the slower time course of signal transduction and also the transcriptional regulation of IL-8 secretion by Cr3, we assessed agonist-induced IL-8 mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 4). T84 cells stimulated with TNF-α expressed increasing IL-8 mRNA levels over time with strong expression at 2 h and peak expression 3 h after the application of the agonist (Fig. 4, dark bars). IL-8 mRNA levels also increased over time after stimulation by Cr3 but with almost no expression until 3 h and peak expression at 4 h (Fig. 4, light bars), consistent with the slower time course of Cr3-induced activation of NF-κB and p38 MAPK. These results show that Cr3, like TNF-α, induces IL-8 secretion in intestinal T84 cells via signaling cascades that involve both NF-κB and p38 MAPK but with slower kinetics.Fig. 4Cr3 induces transcription of IL-8 mRNA. IL-8 mRNA levels in T84 cells stimulated with apical Cr3 (100 μg/ml, light bars) or basolateral TNF-α (10 ng/ml, dark bars) as assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR at the indicated time points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Proinflammatory Signal Transduction by the Pore-forming Cr3 Does Not Require Influx of Extracellular Ca2+—Because other pore-forming proteins may induce proinflammatory signaling cascades by permeabilizing the plasma membrane to extracellular Ca2+, we tested whether Cr3 acts on intestinal cells by this mechanism. First we asked whether Cr3 acts by increasing intracellular Ca2+. Cr3 was applied to T84 intestinal cells alone or together with the muscarinic agonist carbachol, which induced IL-8 secretion by elevating [Ca2+]i, or with TNF-α, which acted independently of [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5, a and b). Here, we found that Cr3 acts synergistically with TNF-α to induce a proinflammatory response (Fig. 5b, compare the fourth column with the second and third). In contrast, Cr3 did not act synergistically with the Ca2+-dependent agonist carbachol (Fig. 5a, compare the fourth column with the second and third). These results suggest that the signaling cascade induced by Cr3 overlaps with that induced by carbachol and may indeed involve the induction of intracellular Ca2+ transients.Fig. 5Cr3-induced IL-8 secretion depends upon intracellular Ca2+. a, IL-8 secretion induced in T84 cells stimulated with 100 μg/ml apical Cr3, 100 μm basolateral carbachol (CCh), or Cr3 with carbachol. Cr3 exhibited no synergy with carbachol (mean ± S.D., representative of three independent experiments performed in duplicate). b, IL-8 secretion induced in T84 cells stimulated with 100 μg/ml apical Cr3, 10 ng/ml basolateral TNF-α, or Cr3 with TNF-α. Cr3 and TNF-α acted synergistically to induce more IL-8 secretion than either agonist alone (mean ± S.D., representative of three independent experiments performed in duplicate). c, IL-8 secretion induced in T84 cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml basolateral TNF-α, 100 μm basolateral carbachol, or 100 μg/ml apical Cr3 in the presence (gray bars) or absence (white bars) of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (30 μm) (mean ± S.E., representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate; *, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To test this idea, we used the membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. BAPTA-AM had no effect on IL-8 secretion from T84 cells induced by the Ca2+-independent agonist TNF-α (Fig. 5c, compare the third and fourth columns) but inhibited the IL-8 secretory response induced by the Ca2+-dependent agonist carbachol (Fig. 5c, compare the fifth and sixth columns). BAPTA-AM also inhibited IL-8 secretion induced by Cr3 (Fig. 5c, the seventh and eighth columns). These results suggest that Cr3 causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+ in intestinal cells that activates the proinflammatory signaling cascade involving NF-κB and p38 MAPK.To test whether Cr3 acts by permeabilizing the apical plasma membrane to Ca2+, we examined the IL-8 secretory response to inflammatory agonists in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Ca2+ was removed from the apical buffer by using the non-membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelator EGTA. As predicted, apical EGTA strongly inhibited IL-8 secretion induced by application of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin to apical membranes of T84 cells (0.7 versus 0.1 ng/ml) (Fig. 6a). Unexpectedly, however, EGTA also caused a 50% reduction in the IL-8 secretory response to the basolateral application of the Ca2+-independent agonist TNF-α. The reason for this effect on TNF-α signal transduction was not explained. Nonetheless, apical EGTA had no detectable effect on the IL-8 secretory response induced by apical Cr3. Thus, Cr3 cannot act by permeabilizing the apical membrane to Ca2+ and inducing extracellular Ca2+ influx.Fig. 6Cr3-induced IL-8 secretion does not depend upon extracellular Ca2+. a, IL-8 secretion induced in T84 cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α,10 μg/ml ionomycin (Ion), or 100 μg/ml Cr3 in the presence (gray bars) or absence (white bars) of the extracellular Ca2+ chelator EGTA (mean ± S.D., representative of two independent experiments performed in duplicate; *, p < 0.05). b, IL-8 secretion induced in T84 cells stimulated with 30 ng/ml basolateral TNF-α, 100 μg/ml Cr3, or 10 μg/ml ionomycin. Cells were bathed in HBSS with Ca2+ (white bars, HBSS+) or without Ca2+ (gray bars, HBSS-) (mean ± S.D., representative of three independent experiments performed in duplicate; *, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm these results, we measured IL-8 secretion induced by Cr3 in T84 cells bathed apically and basolaterally in nominally free Ca2+ buffer (Fig. 6b). Consistent with our results using EGTA, IL-8 secretion induced by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (0.8 versus 0.2 ng/ml) was strongly inhibited by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. The removal of extracellular Ca2+, however, had no effect on IL-8 secretion induced by the Ca2+-independent agonist TNF-α (1.9 versus 1.6 ng/ml) or by Cr3 (1.1 versus 0.8 ng/ml) (Fig. 6b). Thus, signal transduction by Cr3 does not require influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell.Cr3 Induces Secretion of Multiple Proinflammatory Cytokines from T84 Cells—To determine whether the Paneth cell cryptdins act in a general pathway to initiate an inflammatory response, using a commercially available immunoblot array to 40 known proinflammatory proteins, we tested for the production and release of other cytokines. Apically applied Cr3 induced the basolateral secretion of 6 proinflammatory cytokines: macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP)-1α (Fig. 7, compare control and Cr3-treated monolayers, lane 1), MIP-1β (lane 2), MIP-1δ (lane 3), IL-17 (lane 4), IL-12 p70 (lane 5), and IL-8 (lane 6). Basolateral TNF-α induced the same inflammatory cytokines and served as our positive control. These results show that Cr3 induces a general inflammatory response.Fig. 7Cr3 induces secretion of multiple inflammatory cytokines from T84 cells. Immunoblot array analysis of cytokine secretion induced in T84 cells stimulated with 100 μg/ml Cr3 apically or 10 ng/ml TNF-α basolaterally. Cr3 and TNF-α induced basolateral secretion of 6 (of 40 tested) cytokines. Positive dot doublets were excised from each membrane and aligned for visual clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe results of this study show that Paneth cells may play a critical role in coordinating the innate immune response to invading pathogens in the intestine. Somehow, Paneth cells respond to the presence of microbial pathogens by discharging their granule contents (1Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The exocytosis of Paneth cell granules delivers high concentrations of antimicrobial α-defensins, termed cryptdins, into the intestinal crypt lumen. At these concentrations, the cryptdins disrupt microbial cell membranes, thus exerting their anti-microbial activities (1Ayabe T. Satchell D.P. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Cryptdins 2 and 3 also can form pores in eukaryotic cell membranes in vitro (10Lencer W.I. Cheung G. Strohmeier G.R. Currie M. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8585-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Such activity may be cytolytic in vivo. In our first studies on these peptides, however, we discovered that the cryptdins have their own cytoprotective mechanism that could prevent such potential damage to the intestine precisely because they can insert anion-conducting pores into the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and presumably in epithelial cells lining the intestinal crypt in vivo (10Lencer W.I. Cheung G. Strohmeier G.R. Currie M. Ouellette A.J. Selsted M.E. Madara J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8585-8589Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Such pore formation that causes a Cl- secretory response would flush the crypt lumen and reduce the concentration of cryptdins below cytotoxic levels. We now find that this same activity allows the cryptdins to act as novel apical paracrine factors that induce an inflammatory response.The proinflammatory activity of the cryptdins depends on their pore-forming activities. The cryptdins that cannot form pores in eukaryotic cell membranes do not induce an inflammatory response. Here, it is interesting to point out that Cr4, which cannot form pores in T84 cells and does not induce an inflammatory response, is nonetheless the most bactericidal of the cryptdin peptides and is highly membrane disruptive in bacteria (20Satchell D.P.

Here we report the development of a transgenic mouse expressing such a reporter and its use to examine postsynaptic signaling in smooth muscle. The circularly permutated, Ca2+-sensing molecule G-CaMP (Nakai, J., Ohkura, M., and Imoto, K. (2001) Nat.

Intrinsic nerve stimulation evoked rapid, whole-cell Ca2+ transients, or “Ca2+ flashes,” and slowly propagating Ca2+ waves. We show that Ca2+ flashes occur through P2X receptor stimulation and ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ release, whereas Ca2+ waves arise from muscarinic receptor stimulation and inositol trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ release. The distinct ionotropic and metabotropic postsynaptic Ca2+ signals are related at the level of Ca2+ release. Importantly, individual myocytes are capable of both postsynaptic responses, and a transition between Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and inositol trisphosphate waves occurs at higher synaptic inputs.

Genetically encoded cell reporters of cell signaling hold great promise for the study of in vivo cell physiology. This field has advanced rapidly recently with the development of fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based probes such as cameleons (2Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A.

The use of these tools as transgenes in mammals has been quite limited, however, because of difficulties associated with a limited signal/noise ratio of the probes and toxic consequences of cellular expression.

Here we report the production of transgenic mice expressing G-CaMP under control of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoter and the use of these mice to resolve nerve-evoked, postsynaptic signaling in smooth muscle. Postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling shows a graded shift from ryanodine receptor to inositol trisphosphate receptor signaling; these postsynaptic signals have discreet thresholds and are mediated by different neurotransmitters. G-CaMP-signaling mice provide an effective tool to examine Ca2+ signaling in single lineages from complex tissues.

The transgene (17.6 kb) was released by NotI, purified using a QIAEX II kit, and injected into fertilized mouse eggs by standard methods. Animals were genotyped by PCR using primers specific for the circularly permutated eGFP, using an N-terminal probe (758-778: 5′-CTT CAG CTC GAT GCG GTT CAC) and a C-terminal probe (286-306: 5′-GAG CAA AGA CCC CAA CGA GAA G-3′) to amplify a 493-bp fragment (Fig. 1A). Tail DNA was extracted by standard methods and 1 μl of the digest used as a template. Immunostaining—Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were immunostained with rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies, 1:50 dilution (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), and counterstained by standard methods (7Xin H.B. Deng K.Y. Rishniw M. Ji G. Kotlikoff M.I. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 10: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were deparaffinized and rehydrated, blocked with 0.5% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min at room temperature, incubated with Pronase for 20 min at room temperature, and blocked with normal goat serum (prediluted; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and 5% bovine serum albumin. Tissues were then incubated with the primary antibody for 2 h at 37 °C and the secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit, Zymed Laboratories Inc., prediluted) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with Streptavidin peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., prediluted) and then aminoethyl carbazole substrate (Zymed Laboratories Inc. kit) for 5 min at room temperature. Sections were then washed and counterstained with hematoxylin before mounting with fluoromount. Imaging—smGC mice were euthanized with CO2 and tissues rapidly removed and dissected on ice. Segments of the urinary bladder running along the axis from the neck to the fundus were cut to preserve nerve conduction pathways. The segments were placed with the serosal surface on the bottom of an optical recording chamber and a retaining clip containing a stimulating electrode and kevlar fibers placed on top to maintain physiological length of the tissue. The muscle segments were perfused with buffered extracellular solution consisting of (mm): 137 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4). Stimulation pulses were generated by a Grass S48 stimulator controlled by computer-generated TTL pulses and confocal images obtained with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal head attached to a Nikon TMIII inverted microscope. Confocal x-y images were obtained at 71-ms intervals and the stimulation signal encoded in the confocal image. Transmitted light images indicated contractions in individual myocytes, particularly during sustained or high frequency stimulations. The effect of individual cell movement on fluorescence in the isometric preparation was minimized by using low frequency stimulations and excluding from analysis myocytes that undergo prominent shortening. Data were analyzed and pseudolinescans generated by custom-written Matlab routines or by ImageJ. Pseudocolor images were scaled linearly, using the lowest and highest pixel values for the entire image series; pseudolinescans are presented as F/Fo by dividing all pixels by the mean value for that pixel before the event and then scaled between 0.5 and 3. Descriptive parameters for Ca2+ flashes and waves were obtained by least squares fit using custom-written routines in Matlab. An event was considered a Ca2+ wave if wave propagation could be distinguished in consecutive images. Single cells were dissociated as previously described (8Ji G. Barsotti R.J. Feldman M.E. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mesenteric artery images were recorded at 2 frames/s using a Nipkow spinning disk confocal head. Images showing cross-sections of the arterial walls were captured through the center, parallel to the long axis, of an intact pressurized (70 mm Hg) mesenteric artery at 35 °C. The lung slice preparation was similar to that previously described (9Bergner A. Sanderson M.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Briefly, the trachea was cannulated and the lungs filled with 2% agarose (type VII-A: low gelling temperature) before removal. Following cooling, single lobes were sectioned at 100 μm using a vibrated tissue sectioner (OTS-5000; Electron Microscopy Sciences). Confocal images were obtained using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal scan head coupled to a Nikon inverted microscope. In both cases, fluorescence profiles were normalized by dividing the time-dependent fluorescence (F) by the average prestimulation fluorescence (Fo). In Situ Calibration of G-CaMP—Individual muscle segments from smGC mice were incubated in 100 μg/ml saponin in physiological solution at room temperature for 1 h. Segments were mounted on the microscope and fluorescence measured at fixed excitation strength and photomultiplier gain during exposure to solutions in which EGTA and Ca2+ were added at mm concentrations to fix the [Ca2+]free, using the WINMX programs (10Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Mean fluorescence was averaged for 3-5 myocytes within each image for each solution condition, these values were averaged, and the means of all experiments were fit by least squares to the Hill equation: ((F - Fo)/(Fmax - Fo) = 1/(1 + 10n(x-Kd)), where F, Fo, and Fmax are the observed, zero Ca2+, and saturating Ca2+ fluorescence, respectively, n the Hill coefficient, Kd the affinity constant, and x the pCa. Production of Smooth Muscle G-CaMP Transgenic Mice—The Ca2+-sensitive, circularly permutated eGFP variant G-CaMP (1Nakai J. Ohkura M. Imoto K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar) was used to construct a transgene by insertion downstream of the transcriptionally active first intron of the smMHC promoter (6Madsen C.S. Regan C.P. Hungerford J.E. White S.L. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 908-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Regan C.P. Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), which we have previously used to direct robust, smooth muscle-specific eGFP expression in mice (7Xin H.B. Deng K.Y. Rishniw M. Ji G. Kotlikoff M.I. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 10: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The G-CaMP Ca2+ reporter utilizes a circularly permutated eGFP fusion protein that obtains a photoactive conformation upon binding of the C-terminal Ca2+/calmodulin with the N-terminal M13 recognition peptide from myosin light chain kinase. Three founders were crossed with C57BL/6 mice and experiments conducted in two of these lines with the highest expression (smGC-2 and smGC-3, Fig. 1B). Hemizygous smGC mice produce litters of normal size and sex ratio and have expected longevity; histopathological analysis revealed no discernable phenotype associated with the expression of the Ca2+-sensing reporter. Transgene expression was examined by immunostaining with an anti-eGFP polyclonal antibody that recognizes the circularly permutated G-CaMP. As shown in Fig. 1C, the transgene is robustly expressed in vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle and expression is confined to tissues of smooth muscle lineage. Importantly, expression is observed in virtually all cells within a muscle tissue, an obvious advantage in the context of examining cell signaling. Ca2+-sensing in Transgenic Mouse Cells—We examined the function of G-CaMP in a range of smooth muscle tissues. To confirm Ca2+ signaling under optimal optical conditions, G-CaMP was first examined in single myocytes dispersed from the urinary bladder of smGC mice. As shown in Fig. 2A, enzymatically dispersed myocytes display a low but detectable level of fluorescence at rest and respond to Ca2+-mobilizing stimuli (application of 100 μm methacholine) with a greater than 2-fold increase in fluorescence. The Ca2+ reporter is diffusely distributed in the cytosol with no evidence of organellar accumulation, in organelles, which is a common problem associated with membrane-permeant small molecule indicators, and the indicator reports typical Ca2+ oscillations and waves in myocytes despite the slower fluorescence kinetics than achieved, for example, with small organic molecules with low Kd, such as Fluo-4 (1Nakai J. Ohkura M. Imoto K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 12Minta A. Kao J.P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A significant advantage of genetically encoded reporters is the ability to monitor intracellular signaling events in defined cell lineages within complex multicellular tissues without disrupting cell-cell contacts or permeabilizing membranes, a frequent necessity for efficient loading of small molecule reporters. Because G-CaMP does not retain fluorescence emission at 37 °C (1Nakai J. Ohkura M. Imoto K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar), experiments were conducted at room temperature in ex vivo tissues. The Ca2+ dependence of G-CaMP fluorescence was calibrated in saponin-permeabilized urinary bladder muscle segments exposed to solutions with fixed free Ca2+ ranging from 50-1.8 mm and 1 μm Mg2+. As shown in Fig. 2B, in three such experiments the fluorescence of individual cells within muscle segments increased sharply over the physiological range of cellular free Ca2+. The fit of these data to the Hill equation yielded a Kd of 328 nm and a Hill coefficient of 2.9, which may be compared with the values of 235 nm and 3.3 for the recombinant protein measured in vitro (1Nakai J. Ohkura M. Imoto K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). There is a well documented increase in the apparent Kd of Ca2+ indicators measured in the presence of cellular proteins compared with in vitro measurements in physiological salt solutions, probably due to substantial protein binding of the indicator molecules (13Kurebayashi N. Harkins A.B. Baylor S.M. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 1934-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Bassani J.W. Bassani R.A. Bers D.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1453-1460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 15Baylor S.M. Hollingworth S. News Physiol Sci. 2000; 15: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). Given the numerous cellular calmodulin-binding proteins and the effect of protein binding on the Ca2+ affinity of calmodulin (16Olwin B.B. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8081-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), it is likely that interactions between G-CaMP and cellular proteins markedly influence the apparent affinity of the complex for Ca2+. The apparent Kd and Hill coefficient of G-CaMP in smGC mice indicate that ∼93% of the total Ca2+-dependent fluorescence occurs over the range between 100 nm and 1 μm free [Ca2+]i. Thus, G-CaMP is a useful tool for the measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ signaling, although the high Hill coefficient relative to small molecule dual wavelength (17Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) or single wavelength (12Minta A. Kao J.P. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8171-8178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Ca2+ indicators indicates that G-CaMP will be fully bound (and fluorescence thus saturate) under conditions of maximal Ca2+ signaling. The function of G-CaMP was verified in lung, arterial, and urinary bladder smooth muscle. As shown in Fig. 2, Ca2+ signaling was observed in bronchial smooth muscle during constriction of a small airway produced by application of 50 μm methacholine and in arterial myocytes during adrenergic vasoconstriction. Dynamic changes in [Ca2+]i in myocytes within these complex tissues could easily be resolved, and Ca2+ oscillations in individual myocytes were routinely observed. These measurements confirm the utility of smGC mice for the examination of dynamic Ca2+ signaling in a range of physiological preparations. Moreover, Ca2+ signaling can be measured in what is often a single layer of smooth muscle during physiological contractions without disturbing the essential integrity of the tissues. Dual Modes of Postsynaptic Ca2+ Signaling in Urinary Bladder Smooth Muscle—Neuromuscular coupling in many smooth muscles, including the urinary bladder, is known to result from the co-release of acetylcholine and ATP (for review, see Ref. 18Burnstock G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), although little is known about the nature of nerve-evoked Ca2+ signals or the precise role of specific neurotransmitters in mediating distinct postsynaptic Ca2+ events. We used smGC mice to examine postsynaptic neuromuscular signaling in the intact mouse detrusor (urinary bladder) by field-stimulating intrinsic nerves at a distance of several centimeters from imaged myocytes (Fig. 3A). All postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling was eliminated by application of 1 μm tetrodotoxin (data not shown), confirming that the responses consisted of conducted action potentials in intrinsic nerves. Low frequency (0.5-1.0 Hz) stimulation evoked random Ca2+ responses in individual myocytes (Fig. 3B) rather than synchronous responses in all cells, which likely reflects the low probability of neurotransmitter release at individual synapses (19Brain K.L. Jackson V.M. Trout S.J. Cunnane T.C. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Postsynaptic Ca2+ responses resulted in 1.5-3-fold increases in fluorescence of the genetically encoded reporter in situ, similar to the responses observed in single cells (Fig. 2). Interestingly, two distinct postsynaptic Ca2+ transients were observed. The most common events, which we term Ca2+ flashes, were transient increases in [Ca2+]i confined to individual myocytes, or occasionally 2-3 myocytes, characterized by a rapid, almost simultaneous rise in [Ca2+]i throughout the entire myocyte (Fig. 3B). This mode of Ca2+ signaling is quite similar to spontaneous events reported in arterial smooth muscle loaded with fluo-3 (20Asada Y. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Takasaka T. Iino M. J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Less frequently, a second pattern of Ca2+ firing was observed, consisting of slowly propagating, asynchronous Ca2+ waves. Asynchronous Ca2+ waves dominated the postsynaptic response at higher stimulation frequencies (4-10 Hz), suggesting different thresholds for the modes of Ca2+ signaling. Examples of these markedly different postsynaptic Ca2+ signals within the same tissue segment are shown in Fig. 4; pseudolinescans constructed from a line of pixels drawn along the length of myocytes demonstrate slow Ca2+ waves proceeding from one end of a cell to the other at a propagation rate of roughly 15 μm/s, whereas in Ca2+ flashes wave propagation was not detected in x-y image sets acquired at ∼14 Hz. Pharmacologic Dissection of Postsynaptic Ca2+ Responses—We reasoned that the two distinct modes of postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling likely reflect distinct neurotransmitter responses, which have been related to specific contractile responses in the detrusor (21Brading A.F. Williams J.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Previous reports in fluo-4-loaded smooth muscle tissues have identified nerve-evoked or spontaneous asynchronous, propagating Ca2+ waves (22Iino M. Kasai H. Yamazawa T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5026-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Stevens R.J. Publicover N.G. Smith T.K. Nature. 1999; 399: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Lamont C.

Physiol. 2002; 283: H2169-H2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and purinergic, postsynaptic subcellular junctional Ca2+ transients (19Brain K.L. Jackson V.M. Trout S.J. Cunnane T.C. J. Physiol. 2002; 541: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Lamont C. Vainorius E. Wier W.G. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in smooth muscle cells in situ. Asada et al. (20Asada Y. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Takasaka T. Iino M. J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have reported spontaneous Ca2+ flashes in arterial myocytes. Dual modes of nerve-evoked Ca2+ signaling in the same myocytes have not been reported in smooth muscle, however, and we therefore further investigated the nature of these Ca2+ signals. Ca2+ flashes occurred with a shorter lag time following stimulation, the kinetics of the rise and decay of the [Ca2+]i transients were markedly faster, and the peak [Ca2+]i obtained was significantly lower than observed in Ca2+ waves (Fig. 5A). Nerve-evoked postsynaptic Ca2+ flashes were resistant to atropine (1 μm; Fig. 5B) (although the frequency of events was decreased) and to xestospongin (a selective inhibitor of InsP3 receptors) (1 μm, not shown), and the atropine-resistant Ca2+ flashes were completely blocked by ryanodine (10 μm), indicating that they resulted from a rapid Ca2+ release from ryanodine receptors (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus Ca2+ flashes do not arise from the release of acetylcholine or the generation of InsP3. Conversely, Ca2+ waves were never observed in the presence of atropine (1 μm; Fig. 5C) and were virtually abolished following the application of xestospongin (not shown), indicating that cholinergic signaling through InsP3 Ca2+ release results in asynchronous Ca2+ waves, consistent with previous reports (22Iino M. Kasai H. Yamazawa T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5026-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 24Lamont C. Vainorius E. Wier W.G. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that these signals arise from cholinergic signaling. Conversely, the purinergic receptor antagonist suramin blocked all Ca2+ flashes, and all postsynaptic responses were also abolished by the combined action of atropine and the non-selective purinergic receptor antagonist suramin (data not shown). Selective desensitization of P2X receptors with α,β methyleneATP (α,β meATP) further demonstrated that Ca2+ flashes arise by stimulation of P2X receptors (see below). The rapid and synchronous nature of Ca2+ flashes suggested that they arise through P2X-mediated depolarization and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, rather than simply by Ca2+ influx through nonselective P2X channels. This hypothesis was confirmed in two ways. First, incubation with 10 μm ryanodine abolished virtually all Ca2+ flashes without decreasing the probability of Ca2+ waves (Fig. 5D), indicating that ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+-release results in Ca2+ flashes. Second, rapid inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels with nitrendipine (10 μm) also almost completely eliminated Ca2+ flashes (Fig. 5D) without diminishing the probability of postsynaptic asynchronous Ca2+ waves. Relationship between Postsynaptic Ca2+ Responses—Several aspects of the myocyte Ca2+ signals were striking relative to the relationship between the two types of neurotransmitter responses. First, as stated, the probability of observing Ca2+ flashes was markedly higher than that of Ca2+ waves at low stimulation frequencies, which may result largely from prejunctional effects related to the stimulus-dependent release of ATP and acetylcholine (26Burnstock G. Prog. Brain Res. 1986; 68: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) but may also relate to the intrinsic efficiency of the downstream coupling events. Second, we commonly observed Ca2+ flashes followed by a Ca2+ wave in the same cell (Fig. 6A), whereas Ca2+ waves were never followed by Ca2+ flashes during a single stimulation train, suggesting that Ca2+ release by P2X/CICR occurred at a lower threshold of neural input and that muscarinic/InsP3 release depleted Ca2+ stores sufficiently to render myocytes refractory to subsequent CICR. Third, low frequency stimulation commonly evoked repeated Ca2+ flashes, whereas higher frequency stimulation resulted in a wave in the same cell (Fig. 6B), further indicating a higher threshold for muscarinic postsynaptic Ca2+ responses. The role of P2X receptors in rapid Ca2+ flashes and the relationship between postsynaptic signaling modes in individual cells was established by using the selective P2X agonist α,β meATP, which rapidly desensitizes P2X1 receptors, highly expressed in urinary bladder smooth muscle (27Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 28Hoyle C.H. Burnstock G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 114: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the presence of α,β meATP, Ca2+ flashes were almost completely abolished and all postsynaptic signaling shifted to prominent, asynchronous Ca2+ waves, the probability of which was markedly enhanced by P2X receptor desensitization (Fig. 6, C and D). The augmented probability of Ca2+ waves at low stimulation frequency under conditions of P2X1 desensitization (and the increase in the probability of Ca2+ waves in the presence of ryanodine or nitrendipine (Fig. 5D)) further suggest that the rapid release of Ca2+ by ionotropic receptor stimulation and CICR raises the threshold for the slower activating and more sustained Ca2+ release occurring through InsP3R gating. Thus, these data suggest a degree of postsynaptic signal integration within myocytes. The combination of transgenic, molecular engineering, and imaging technologies provides remarkable opportunities to design and target the expression of molecules that can be used to report critical cellular events in vivo (29Wang J.W. Wong A.M. Flores J. Vosshall L.B. Axel R. Cell. 2003; 112: 271-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 30Liu L. Yermolaieva O. Johnson W.A. Abboud F.M. Welsh M.J. Nat.

Neurophysiol. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). smGC mice reported here provide a means to efficiently examine physiological, postsynaptic signaling in vascular and nonvascular smooth muscle, and additional lines of mice with lineage-restricted expression of G-CaMP are likely to provide an important experimental advantage for the study of multicellular physiological processes in mammals. Moreover, crosses of these and other signaling mice with gene-targeted mice will provide a powerful tool to evaluate mammalian gene function in vivo. G-CaMP is robustly expressed in smGC mice and can be used to examine vascular and nonvascular Ca2+ signaling in situ. We have used G-CaMP transgenic mice to investigate postsynaptic Ca2+ responses in individual myocytes in intact muscle of the urinary bladder. Our results indicate that individual visceral smooth muscle cells respond to motor nerve depolarization by two distinct modes of postsynaptic Ca2+ responses: rapid Ca2+ flashes that occur through CICR mediated by ATP binding to P2X receptors and slower, InsP3-mediated Ca2+ waves mediated by acetylcholine-activating muscarinic receptors. These data are consistent with numerous previous studies identifying cholinergic and purinergic excitatory neurotransmission and a prominent P2X component in visceral smooth muscles (27Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 28Hoyle C.H. Burnstock G. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), extending information about these processes to the postsynaptic Ca2+ responses within individual myocytes in intact tissues. Evoked Ca2+ responses arising from the separate actions of ATP and acetylcholine on ionotropic (P2X) and metabotropic (muscarinic) receptors are remarkably distinct at the level of intracellular Ca2+ release; rapid purinergic Ca2+ flashes result from CICR, mediated by P2X and channel gating and ryanodine receptor gating. Although the CICR process likely initiates with one or more localized Ca2+ sparks (36Collier M.L. Ji G. Wang Y. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the imaging bandwidth employed, as well as the poor quantum efficiency and slow transition kinetics of G-CaMP at low Ca2+ concentration (1Nakai J. Ohkura M. Imoto K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar), precluded identification of such events in these experiments. Measurements of Ca2+ signals in single myocytes correspond extremely well with a previous study of the neural basis of contractile responses in the urinary bladder in which atropine inhibited high frequency contractions in the rat and guinea pig detrusor but had little effect at low stimulation frequencies, whereas α,β meATP maximally inhibited low frequency stimulations (21Brading A.F. Williams J.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 99: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, distinct modes of postsynaptic Ca2+ release in single myocytes strongly correlate with force production in the intact muscle. Our findings also highlight the specific relationship between the different modes of postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling in smooth muscle. The rapid ionotropic response occurs with a distinctly lower stimulus threshold than metabotropic Ca2+ signaling, and the occurrence of Ca2+ release through an ionotropic response appears to increase the threshold for the metabotropic response, indicating an interdependence at the level of intracellular Ca2+ release. That is, by releasing Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, rapid Ca2+ flashes appear to decrease the probability of Ca2+ waves, thereby modulating the kinetics and intensity of muscle contraction. Our data do not exclude other interactions, however, such as the participation of ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels in the propagation of Ca2+ waves. Importantly, individual myocytes are capable of both postsynaptic responses, which are functionally linked at the level of Ca2+ release. These findings suggest a general mechanism by which a low frequency of firing of autonomic motor nerves results in a rapid mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and graded, transient contractions, whereas increases in motor nerve depolarizations, through presynaptic mechanisms that result in augmented release of acetylcholine and shifts in the mode of postsynaptic signaling, result in slower Ca2+ waves and sustained contractions. This mechanism likely facilitates the rapid activation of detrusor muscle. In summary, we report the production and use of transgenic mice for the investigation of Ca2+ signaling in living tissues. Advances in the quantum yield and stability of protein-based signaling molecules, as well as the generalization of this approach to the detection of other intracellular molecules, will likely markedly extend the scope and physiological relevance of studies of cell function.

https://openalex.org/W2091687594,"The CD28 co-stimulatory pathway is well established for T cell activation; however, results from CD28 -/- mice suggest the existence of additional co-stimulatory pathways. Here we report the further characterization of a new member of the CD2 superfamily, NTB-A, important in T cell co-stimulation. NTB-A is expressed on T cells, and its expression is up-regulated on activated cells. Triggering of NTB-A with monoclonal antibodies in the absence of CD28 signals leads to T cell proliferation and interferon-γ secretion but not interleukin-4. Cross-linking of NTB-A also induces phosphorylation of NTB-A and the association of SAP (SLAM-associated protein), the protein absent in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease. T helper cells differentiated by cross-linking NTB-A and CD3 developed predominantly into Th1 cells not Th2 cells. In vivo blocking of NTB-A interactions with its ligands by using soluble NTB-A-Fc fusion protein inhibits B cell isotype switching to IgG2a and IgG3, commonly induced by Th1-type cytokines. Most important, treatment of mice with NTB-A-Fc delays the onset of antigen-induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in myelin basic protein-T cell receptor transgenic mice, suggesting a role in T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Regulation of interferon-γ secretion, and not interleukin-4 in vitro, as well as inhibition of Th1 cell-induced isotype switching and attenuation of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis indicate that NTB-A is important for Th1 responses. The observation that cross-linking of NTB-A induces T cell activation, expansion, and Th1-type cytokine production suggests NTB-A is a novel co-stimulatory receptor. The identification of NTB-A as a regulator of T cell response paves the way to provide novel therapeutic approaches for modulation of the immune response. The CD28 co-stimulatory pathway is well established for T cell activation; however, results from CD28 -/- mice suggest the existence of additional co-stimulatory pathways. Here we report the further characterization of a new member of the CD2 superfamily, NTB-A, important in T cell co-stimulation. NTB-A is expressed on T cells, and its expression is up-regulated on activated cells. Triggering of NTB-A with monoclonal antibodies in the absence of CD28 signals leads to T cell proliferation and interferon-γ secretion but not interleukin-4. Cross-linking of NTB-A also induces phosphorylation of NTB-A and the association of SAP (SLAM-associated protein), the protein absent in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease. T helper cells differentiated by cross-linking NTB-A and CD3 developed predominantly into Th1 cells not Th2 cells. In vivo blocking of NTB-A interactions with its ligands by using soluble NTB-A-Fc fusion protein inhibits B cell isotype switching to IgG2a and IgG3, commonly induced by Th1-type cytokines. Most important, treatment of mice with NTB-A-Fc delays the onset of antigen-induced experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in myelin basic protein-T cell receptor transgenic mice, suggesting a role in T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Regulation of interferon-γ secretion, and not interleukin-4 in vitro, as well as inhibition of Th1 cell-induced isotype switching and attenuation of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis indicate that NTB-A is important for Th1 responses. The observation that cross-linking of NTB-A induces T cell activation, expansion, and Th1-type cytokine production suggests NTB-A is a novel co-stimulatory receptor. The identification of NTB-A as a regulator of T cell response paves the way to provide novel therapeutic approaches for modulation of the immune response. T cell activation requires two distinct signals as follows: the first signal through the T cell receptor (TCR), 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; EAE, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis; MBP, myelin basic protein; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; XLP, X-linked lymphoproliferative; NP-KLH, nitrophenol-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; m, murine; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; SAP, SLAM-associated protein. which maintains antigen specificity, and a second co-stimulatory signal, from another receptor such as CD28 (1Carreno B.M. Collins M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 29-53Google Scholar). Interaction of CD28 with its ligands B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86) expressed on activated antigen-presenting cells is thought to provide T cells with the necessary signals for proper activation and development into effector T cells. Although CD28 is considered a primary receptor for the second signal, CD28-deficient mice can still mount an antigen-specific T cell response, suggesting the existence of other co-stimulatory molecules (2Lucas P.J. Negishi I. Nakayama K. Fields L.E. Loh D.Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5757-5768Google Scholar, 3Shahinian A. Pfeffer K. Lee K.P. Kundig T.M. Kishihara K. Wakeham A. Kawai K. Ohashi P.S. Thompson C.B. Mak T.W. Science. 1993; 261: 609-612Google Scholar). For instance, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are still functional in CD28-deficient mice, and these mice also exhibit delayed type hypersensitivity in response to viral infection. Several other receptors in the CD28 family have been subsequently cloned in recent years. ICOS is a positive regulatory receptor in the family, which can provide co-stimulatory signals to T cells, although ICOS does not activate naive T cells and is thought to be involved primarily in T helper cell development (4Tafuri A. Shahinian A. Bladt F. Yoshinaga S.K. Jordana M. Wakeham A. Boucher L.M. Bouchard D. Chan V.S. Duncan G. Odermatt B. Ho A. Itie A. Horan T. Whoriskey J.S. Pawson T. Penninger J.M. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W.

Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 97-101Google Scholar). The current data in the field indicate that there may be other positive regulatory receptors yet to be identified. In addition to CD28 family members, other receptors such as those belonging to the CD2 superfamily can also provide the second signal for co-stimulation. Included in the CD2 super-family are CD2 (LFA-2), CD48, CD58 (LFA-3), CD84, CD150 (SLAM), and CD244 (2B4) (7Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1993; 178: 1397-1406Google Scholar). The CD2 family of receptors and ligands are expressed throughout the immune system and play an important role in immune responses. Although CD2 can act as a co-stimulatory molecule on T cells, CD2-deficient mice exhibit normal T cell responses, suggesting a redundant role for CD2 in T cell co-stimulation (15Killeen N. Stuart S.G. Littman D.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4329-4336Google Scholar). The importance of CD2 becomes much clearer when analyzed in the context of CD28 deficiency. CD2-/-/CD28-/- double knockout mice exhibit a much more severe T cell activation defect when compared with CD28-deficient mice, underscoring the important contribution of CD2 in T cell co-stimulation (16Green J.M. Karpitskiy V. Kimzey S.L. Shaw A.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3591-3595Google Scholar). Still, in the absence of both of these receptors, T cells can be activated under certain circumstances. Clearly, other molecules in addition to CD28 and CD2 are involved in early T cell activation. Another CD2 superfamily member, CD150, can also provide a co-stimulatory signal to T cells (10Cocks B.G. Chang C.C. Carballido J.M. Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Aversa G. Nature. 1995; 376: 260-263Google Scholar, 11Aversa G. Chang C.C. Carballido J.M. Cocks B.G. de Vries J.E. J.

CD150 is included in a subfamily of receptors that are characterized by extracellular immunoglobulin-like repeats and intracellular binding sites for SAP (SH2D1A), the protein associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) disease (9de la Fuente M.A. Pizcueta P.

Science's STKE. 2002; http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2002/E8Google Scholar). The basis for the lymphoproliferation defect seen in XLP patients has been attributed to defects in T cell and NK cell function, although there is no clear understanding of how SAP deficiency contributes to this disease at this time. A better understanding of SAP will come from studying the function of receptors associated with SAP. The most well studied SAP-associated receptor is CD150. CD150 can provide a co-stimulatory signal to T cells, inducing proliferation and IFN-γ expression. There is also evidence for CD150 involvement in Th1 cell responses, suggesting the importance of this molecule in inflammation and autoimmune disease (10Cocks B.G. Chang C.C. Carballido J.M. Yssel H. de Vries J.E. Aversa G. Nature. 1995; 376: 260-263Google Scholar, 11Aversa G. Chang C.C. Carballido J.M. Cocks B.G. de Vries J.E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4036-4044Google Scholar, 12Aversa G.

Recently, CD84, another CD2/CD150 family member, was found to possess co-stimulatory activity on T cells (25Martin M. Romero X. de la Fuente M.A. Tovar V. Zapater N. Esplugues E. Pizcueta P. Bosch J. Engel P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3668-3676Google Scholar). Clearly this family of receptors plays an important role in co-stimulation and lymphocyte regulation, based on its role in lymphocyte activation and association with XLP. Given the important role of CD2 superfamily members in the immune system, we sought to identify novel members of this family. In our search, we have identified a protein referred to as TCOM (for T cell co-stimulatory molecule), which shares high amino acid similarity with CD2/CD150 family members. TCOM is identical to NTB-A and SF2000, cloned by Bottino et al. (26Bottino C. Falco M. Parolini S. Marcenaro E. Augugliaro R. Sivori S. Landi E. Biassoni R. Notarangelo L.D. Moretta L. Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 235-246Google Scholar) and Fraser et al. (27Fraser C.C. Howie D. Morra M. Qiu Y. Murphy C. Shen Q. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Coyle A. Kingsbury G.A. Terhorst C. Immunogenetics. 2002; 53: 843-850Google Scholar), respectively; therefore, we refer to our molecule as NTB-A. We show that NTB-A enhances the Th1 cell phenotype, and cross-linking of NTB-A induces phosphorylation of NTB-A and SAP association. An NTB-A-Fc fusion protein inhibits Th1 cytokine-induced isotype switching and attenuates EAE, indicating that NTB-A is important for in vivo T cell responses including Th1 cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Generation of Anti-NTB-A Monoclonal Antibody and NTB-A Fusion Proteins—NTB-A-His consists of the first 226 amino acids of NTB-A, which compose the extracellular region of the protein, fused to six His residues. NTB-A-Fc consists of the first 226 amino acids of NTB-A fused to the Fc portion of murine IgG1. For monoclonal antibody generation, mice were immunized with NTB-A-His protein. Several hybridomas were screened for recognition of NTB-A. Specificity of the antibody was confirmed by ELISA binding to NTB-A-Fc as well as by binding to 293 cells transfected with full-length NTB-A. Homotypic Binding of NTB-A—Human NTB-A-His or 19A-His was coated onto Nunc Maxisorb plates at 2 μg/ml and washed off. After blocking in 10% fetal calf serum, NTB-A-Fc or 19A-Fc was titrated on the plate starting at 20 μg/ml. Binding of the Fc fusion proteins was detected using Fc-specific goat anti-human IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). For detection of cell surface binding, full-length human NTB-A or human 19A was transfected into 293T cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed in PBS and incubated with 5 μg/ml NTB-A-Fc plus 5% normal goat serum for 1 h. Cells were then washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Biotinylated goat anti-human Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added to the cells at 1:400 dilution and incubated for 30 min, followed by washing in PBS. Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used at 1:400 dilution for detection. Cell staining was analyzed using a ×40 objective and SPOT camera. NTB-A Co-stimulation Assay—Costar 96-well U-bottom plates were coated overnight with 0.1 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody (Pharmingen), 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 (Pharmingen), 1 μg/ml IgG1, or 1 μg/ml anti-NTB-A antibody generated against the extracellular domain of human NTB-A. Human CD4+ T cells were purified from whole blood by negative selection using the CD4 T cell MACs separation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The resulting CD4 T cell population was 95% pure. Naive CD4 T cells were separated by positive selection of CD45RA+ cells. The remaining CD4 T cells were saved as the memory CD4 T cell fraction. Naive and memory T cells were plated at 0.5 × 106 T cells per well in RPMI. On the 3rd day, supernatant was removed for cytokine analysis (by ELISA or Luminex, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and the cells were pulsed for 16 h with [3H]thymidine. For Jurkat cell stimulation, Costar plates were coated as described above and 0.5 × 106 Jurkat cells were stimulated for 24 h. At 24 h, the cells were analyzed by FACS for expression of the activation marker, CD69 (Pharmingen). Co-stimulation of mouse T cells was carried out by coating a plate with 0.1 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody (Pharmingen), 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 (Pharmingen), 1 μg/ml IgG1, or 1 μg/ml anti-NTB-A that cross-reacted to mouse form. CD4 T cells were isolated from the spleen of a C57/B6 mouse by negative selection using the CD4 T cell isolation kit from Miltenyi Biotec. 0.5 × 106 CD4 T cells were activated for 3 days, and on the 3rd day, supernatant was removed for cytokine analysis, and the cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine. T Helper Cell Differentiation—Naive human CD4 T cells were isolated from peripheral blood by negative selection and Automacs sorting. Cells were either stimulated with anti-CD3 coated at 2 μg/ml plus anti-CD28 coated at 1 μg/ml (Pharmingen) or with anti-CD3 coated at 2 μg/ml plus anti-NTB-A coated at 1 μg/ml. For Th0 conditions, cells were cultured with IL-2, anti-INF-γ, anti-IL-12, and anti-IL-4 antibody. For Th1 conditions, cells were cultured with IL-2, IL-12, and anti-IL-4 in RPMI. For Th2 conditions, cells were cultured with IL-2, IL-4, anti-IL-12, and anti-INF-γ in RPMI. Concentrations of antibodies and cytokines were as follows: IL-2, 2 ng/ml; IL-4, ng/ml; IL-12, 5 ng/ml; anti-IFN-γ,1 μg/ml; anti-IL-12, 1 μg/ml; anti-IL-4, 1 μg/ml (R & D Systems). Three days after the initial activation, the T cells were washed and left to rest with only IL-2 in the media. After 7 days, cells were re-stimulated for 24 h with anti-CD3 only coated at 2 μg/ml in 96-well plates. The cell number per well was 0.5 × 106. Supernatants were then removed for cytokine analysis by Luminex (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). NTB-A Immunoprecipitation and Western Blots—107 Jurkat T cells were treated with pervanadate for 15 min at 37 °C and lysed in RIPA buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were pre-cleared with 10 μg of mIgG1 and protein G; then NTB-A was immunoprecipitated using 10 μg of a mixture of IgG1 monoclonal antibodies raised against the extracellular domain of NTB-A. LAIR was also immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody DX26 (Pharmingen). Beads were washed with RIPA buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Association of SAP was detected by Western blot (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), along with SHP-1 and SHP-2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Human T cells were isolated by AutoMACS sorting of CD4 positive cells from blood. 4 × 107 T cells were used per condition. Cells were first incubated with 8 μg of anti-CD3 (Pharmingen) and 8 μg of anti-NTB-A antibodies. Cells were then washed, left to rest in PBS, and then stimulated with 4 μg of goat anti-mouse Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 min to cross-link the receptors. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot were carried out as described above. In Vivo T-dependent B Cell Responses—C57/B6 mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 100 μg of NP(23)-KLH emulsified 1:1 in Complete Freund's Adjuvant. Mice were injected intraperitoneally daily with 100 μg of mNTB-A-Fc fusion protein or mIgG1 as a control. After 10 days, serum was obtained, and NP-specific immunoglobulins were measured by ELISA. Nunc maxisorb plates were coated overnight with NP(23)-bovine serum albumin at 10 μg/ml. After washing and blocking with 10% fetal calf serum, dilutions of serum were then added to the plate for 2 h. After washing the serum from the plate, biotinylated anti-isotype-specific antibodies were added to the plate. The antibodies used included biotinylated anti-IgM, anti-IgG1, anti-IgG2a, and anti-IgG3 (Pharmingen). Detection was carried out with streptavidin-horse-radish peroxidase and TMB (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate. Induction of EAE—Two groups of MBP TCR transgenic mice were immunized with 10 μg of Ac1–11/Complete Freund's Adjuvant subcutaneously on day 0. One group of 8 mice was injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of mNTB-A-Fc daily, and the other group of 9 mice was injected with 100 μg of mIgG1 daily. On days 1 and 2, mice were given 200 ng of pertussis toxin intraperitoneally. Mice were evaluated daily for signs of disease. Disease scores were as follows: 0, no disease; 1, tail droop or hind limb weakness; 2, paralysis involving one limb; 3, paralysis involving two limbs; 4, death. Characterization of NTB-A Expression—In a search for novel CD2 family members, we identified a protein referred to as TCOM (for T cell co-stimulatory molecule). Shortly thereafter, this novel protein was described by Bottino et al. (26Bottino C. Falco M. Parolini S. Marcenaro E. Augugliaro R. Sivori S. Landi E. Biassoni R. Notarangelo L.D. Moretta L. Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 235-246Google Scholar) and Fraser et al. (27Fraser C.C. Howie D. Morra M. Qiu Y. Murphy C. Shen Q. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Coyle A. Kingsbury G.A. Terhorst C. Immunogenetics. 2002; 53: 843-850Google Scholar) as NTB-A and SF2000, respectively. NTB-A has been show to play a role in NK cell activity; however, a physiological role in T cells has yet to be examined. Like other family members NTB-A has two predicted immunoglobulin-like repeats in the extracellular domain as well as three tyrosine motifs in the intracellular domain. Two of these domains bear the TXYXX(V/I) motif, which is commonly found in the cytoplasmic domains of CD2 family members, and act as a SAP-binding domain in CD150. The murine form of NTB-A was also cloned based on sequence homology with the human form and is identical to Ly108 (28Peck S.R. Ruley H.E. Immunogenetics. 2000; 52: 63-72Google Scholar). The amino acid similarity between the mouse and human NTB-A is 46%, and the two TXYXX(V/I) motifs are highly conserved between species. By using both the human and murine form of NTB-A, our studies define a novel role for NTB-A in T cell activation. Expression of human NTB-A on cell lines was evaluated using a monoclonal antibody raised against the extracellular domain of NTB-A. Our monoclonal antibody detected NTB-A expression on several T cells lines including Jurkat, MOLT3, and MOLT4 (Fig. 1A). Some, but not all, B cell lines were also positive for NTB-A expression, including Raji, Ramos, and Daudi cell lines. No cell surface expression of NTB-A was detected on other cell lines including a breast adenocarcinoma (MDA231), a monocyte line (THP-1), and a kidney epithelial cell line (293). In addition to cells lines, cell surface expression of NTB-A on human peripheral T cells was also detected (Fig. 1B). Stimulation of T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies led to up-regulation of NTB-A surface expression at 24 h (data not shown), with even higher expression seen at 48 h post-activation (Fig. 1B). Human peripheral B cells also express NTB-A and NTB-A expression increased upon stimulation with anti-CD40 and IL-4 (Fig. 1C). High expression of NTB-A on CD4+CD45RO+ memory T cells was also observed (Fig. 1D). Our data indicate that NTB-A is expressed on both naive and activated lymphocytes. Homotypic Binding of NTB-A—Homotypic interaction has been demonstrated for CD150 (29Mavaddat N. Mason D.W. Atkinson P.D. Evans E.J. Gilbert R.J. Stuart D.I. Fennelly J.A. Barclay A.N. Davis S.J. Brown M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28100-28109Google Scholar, 30Punnonen J. Cocks B.G. Carballido J.M. Bennett B. Peterson D. Aversa G. de Vries J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 993-1004Google Scholar), and it is suggested that other closely related family members (CD84 and Ly9) may also exhibit homotypic binding (25Martin M. Romero X. de la Fuente M.A. Tovar V. Zapater N. Esplugues E. Pizcueta P. Bosch J. Engel P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3668-3676Google Scholar). To determine whether NTB-A can also act as a self-ligand, we looked for NTB-A:NTB-A association in a number of assays. First, the ability of NTB-A to bind to cell-surface-expressed NTB-A was analyzed by transfection of 293T cells with the full-length form of human NTB-A or human 19A, a member of the CD150 family of receptors (Fig. 2A). The transfected cells were incubated with an NTB-A-Fc fusion protein. Binding of NTB-A-Fc to the cell surface was observed only in 293T cells transfected with NTB-A and not in cells transfected with 19A, suggesting that NTB-A can bind to cell-surface-expressed NTB-A and that this interaction is specific. No significant binding of NTB-A-Fc was found to cells transfected with other CD2 family members, including CD150, BLAME, or 2B4 (data not shown). In an ELISA, we find that NTB-A-Fc can specifically associate with NTB-A-His protein coated on a plate (Fig. 2B). 19A-Fc does not associate with NTBA-His bound to a plate, and NTBA-Fc does not bind to 19A-His bound to a plate. BIAcore assays were also carried out to determine the affinity of His-tagged NTB-A protein for itself. Homotypic binding of His-NTB-A was found to be a very weak interaction (Kd >100 μm) (data not shown). Most interesting, the CD150-CD150 interaction has been reported to be very weak as well at 200 μm (29Mavaddat N. Mason D.W. Atkinson P.D. Evans E.J. Gilbert R.J. Stuart D.I. Fennelly J.A. Barclay A.N. Davis S.J. Brown M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28100-28109Google Scholar). Our data indicate that NTB-A can bind to itself very weakly, and because the interaction is to weak, we cannot rule out the existence of other ligands for NTB-A. Co-stimulation of T Cells by NTB-A—To determine whether NTB-A is capable of providing a co-stimulatory signal to T cells, we isolated naive and memory human peripheral CD4 T cells and stimulated them with anti-NTB-A antibody and a suboptimal dose of anti-CD3 antibody. Anti-CD3 treatment alone only induced minimal proliferation in the naive T cells, whereas higher proliferation was seen in the memory T cells because these cells do not require co-stimulation for activation (Fig. 3A). Treatment with anti-NTB-A or anti-CD28 antibody alone did not induce proliferation or IFN-γ secretion in naive or memory T cells. The combination of anti-NTB-A with a suboptimal dose of anti-CD3 in the absence of anti-CD28 antibody led to a substantial level of proliferation that was higher than anti-CD3 alone and slightly lower than the proliferation induced with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 treatment. Increase in IFN-γ expression corresponded to the increase in proliferation induced by anti-CD3 plus anti-NTB-A treatment. The effect of anti-NTB was more dramatic in the naive T cells, presumably due to the fact that memory cells respond very strongly to anti-CD3 treatment alone. IFN-γ secretion induced by anti-CD3 treatment was not augmented by the addition of anti-NTB-A. The ability of NTB-A to activate Jurkat T cells was assessed by culturing Jurkat cells on plates coated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, anti-NTB-A, or a combination of these antibodies. Twenty four hours after activation, Jurkat cells that were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-NTB-A up-regulated expression of the activation marker CD69 (Fig. 3B). Co-stimulation of murine CD4 T cells was also carried out by using antibody that cross-reacts to the murine form of NTB-A (Fig. 3C). We find similar results as with human T cells, including induced proliferation and IFN-γ expression with NTB-A co-stimulation, indicating the murine and human forms of NTB-A function similarly in T cells. Thus, our results suggest that NTB-A is capable of co-stimulating T cells to a level similar to CD28. NTB-A Promotes Th1 Cell Phenotype—Given that NTB-A cross-linking can induce proliferation and INF-γ secretion, we next sought to determine whether NTB-A influences Th1 or Th2 cell differentiation. Purified human CD4 T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-NTB-A under Th1-inducing conditions or under Th2-inducing conditions. This stimulation was independent of a CD28 signal because no anti-CD28 agonistic reagents were used where anti-NTB-A antibody was used. For comparison, cells were also stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 under appropriate Th1 or Th2 conditions. After 3 days of stimulation, the cells were washed and rested for 4 days with IL-2. After that time, all cells were re-stimulated with anti-CD3 only. Th1 cells stimulated with anti-NTB-A secreted more IFN-γ compared with Th1 cells stimulated with anti-CD28, and Th0 cells also had slightly higher levels of INF-γ (Fig. 4). Levels of IL-4 and IL-5, Th2-type cytokines, were comparable in all samples, indicating that NTB-A had no effect distinguishable from CD28 on the differentiation of Th2 cells. These results suggest that NTB-A helps to enhance the Th1 cell phenotype by inducing more Th1-type cytokine expression. Most interesting, effects of NTB-A in enhancing differentiation of T cells to Th1 were completely independent of CD28 signals. Phosphorylation of NTB-A and SAP Association—We have demonstrated that cross-linking of CD3 and NTB-A on T cells leads to proliferation and IFN-γ expression. We next sought to analyze the molecular events associated with CD3 and NTB-A cross-linking. A hallmark of CD2 family members is the presence of two to four SAP-binding motifs (TXYXX(V/I)) in the intracellular domain; SAP can bind to the both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of CD150, although SAP has a higher affinity for the phosphorylated form (31Li S.C.

Both human and mouse NTB-A have two SAP-binding motifs in the intracellular domain. To determine whether NTB-A also associates with these CD150-associated proteins, Jurkat T cells were treated with pervanadate to induce phosphorylation of NTB-A. NTB-A was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the association of SAP, SHP-1, and SHP-2 was determined by Western blot. SAP association with NTB-A was not detected in untreated cells. However, SAP did associate with NTB-A in pervanadate-treated cells, suggesting a phosphorylation-dependent association of SAP with NTB-A. SHP-1 and SHP-2, although expressed in Jurkat cells, were not found associated with NTB-A in either untreated or in pervanadate-treated cells (Fig. 5A). This lack of association with SHP-1 or SHP-2 suggests a signaling mechanism distinct from CD150 in T cells. The inhibitory receptor LAIR does associate with SHP-1 and SHP-2 in pervanadate-treated Jurkat cells, ruling out the possibility that SHP-1 and SHP-2 are not capable of being immunoprecipitated in our system (Fig. 5A). To study the signaling events following co-stimulation with NTB-A in T cells, we next analyzed the phosphorylation of NTB-A induced by cross-linking CD3 and NTB-A in freshly isolated human T cells (Fig. 5B). NTB-A is phosphorylated upon cross-linking of CD3 and NTB-A in human T cells as shown by immunoprecipitation of NTB-A and Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Most interesting, SAP does not associate with NTB-A in untreated human T cells, but SAP does associate with co-stimulation-induced phosphorylated NTB-A. Similar to Jurkat cells, SHP1 and SHP2 do not associate with NTB-A in human T cells, although both proteins are expressed. These findings suggest a mechanism by which cross-linking of NTB-A induces NTB-A phosphorylation and SAP association in T cells. It is possible that these signaling events then lead to proliferation and IFN-γ secretion. NTB-A-Fc Inhibits Th1 Cell-induced Isotype Switching—Our data thus far suggest that NTB-A may act to induce Th1 T cell responses. We next analyzed whether NTB-A plays a role in T-dependent B cell responses. To block a possible ligand interaction with NTB-A in vivo, we used a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular portion of murine NTB-A fused to an Fc domain (mNTB-A-Fc). C57/B6 mice were immunized with NP(23)-KLH and treated daily with mNTB-A-Fc or mIgG1 as a control. Ten days after immunization, serum was analyzed for the expression of NP-specific immunoglobulin isotypes (Fig. 6). Generally, Th2-type cytokines such as IL-4 induce the increase of switching to the IgG1 isotype and suppress the switching to IgG2a and IgG3. Th1-type cytokines such as IFN-γ suppress switching to IgG1 and increase switching to IgG2a and IgG3. Mice treated with mNTB-A-Fc demonstrated decreased levels of IgG2a and IgG3 and increased levels of IgG1, which is indicative of the presence of Th2-type cytokines such as IL-4. These results suggest that mNTB-A-Fc suppressed B cell isotype switching to IFN-γ-induced isotypes, possibly by inhibiting the activation of Th1 cells during immunization. Although we have demonstrated a homotypic interaction for NTB-A, the weak binding affinity suggests that there may be an additional ligand for NTB-A. The addition of the fusion protein in vivo may act to block this ligand in vivo and prevent the activation and development of Th1 cells. NTB-A-Fc Delays Onset of EAE—The increase in IFN-γ expression induced by NTB-A suggests that NTB-A may act to skew T cell responses to a Th1 response. To determine the effect of NTB-A in Th1-mediated autoimmune disease, we analyzed the effect of an NTB-A-Fc fusion protein in a murine model for multiple sclerosis, EAE. MBP TCR transgenic mice were immunized with Ac1-11 (NH2-terminal peptide from MBP) and treated daily with either NTB-A-Fc or mIgG1 control protein. Disease progression was monitored each day, and the onset of disease began at day 5 in the control mice (Fig. 7). Mice treated with mNTB-A-Fc showed a delayed onset of disease at day 8, and 20% of the mice never developed disease. The ability of mNTB-A-Fc to delay the onset of EAE in MBP TCR transgenic mice suggests that the fusion protein may dampen effector functions of T cells because EAE is a predominantly a Th1 cell-mediated disease. Based on the ability of NTB-A-Fc to decrease Th1 cytokine-induced isotype switching, we hypothesize that NTB-A-Fc delays EAE development by inhibition of the generation of Th1 responses. Recognition of antigen by TCR is not sufficient for proper T cell activation. Additional co-stimulatory molecules are required, and this provides the basis for the “two signal model” of lymphocyte activation. Members of the CD28/B7 family of co-stimulatory molecules are generally considered to provide the major pathway for co-stimulation. However, data including analysis of CD28-deficient T cells suggest that other co-stimulatory molecules exist that can provide the second signal for T cells. The CD2 superfamily has been implicated in T cell co-stimulation. Included in this superfamily is the CD150 subfamily of receptors, which associate with SAP. Human patients who lack expression of SAP have major defects in cell-mediated immunity and succumb to massive lymphocyte infiltration to multiple organs, a syndrome called X-linked proliferative disease (XLP). Thus, the CD2/CD150 family members may play a significant part in cellular immunity. We have identified a new T cell function for the CD2 family member, NTB-A. We find that NTB-A can co-stimulate T cells to proliferate and secrete IFN-γ. NTB-A cross-linking leads to phosphorylation of the receptor and association of SAP, but not SHP-1 or SHP-2, in human T cells. Our data suggest that NTB-A plays a role in Th1 cell responses because Th1 cells stimulated with NTB-A secrete more Th1- and not Th2-type cytokines. An NTB-A-Fc fusion protein inhibits IFN-γ-induced isotype switching. NTB-A-Fc also delays development and severity of a mouse model for multiple sclerosis. NTB-A contains two ITSM (TXYXX(V/I)) motifs in its intracellular domain. These motifs have been shown to bind SAP in other receptors including CD150 and 2B4. Co-stimulation induced by cross-linking of CD3 and NTB-A leads to early phosphorylation of NTB-A and association of SAP but not SHP-1 or SHP-2. SAP is composed largely of an SH2 domain, and it was previously thought to block interaction of SH2 domain-containing proteins such as SHP-2 (22Sayos J. Wu C. Morra M. Wang N. Zhang X. Allen D. van Schaik S. Notarangelo L. Geha R. Roncarolo M.G. Oettgen H. De Vries J.E. Aversa G. Terhorst C. Nature. 1998; 395: 462-469Google Scholar). Unlike CD150, NTB-A does not associate with SHP-2. Lack of association of NTB-A with SHP-2 in T cells suggests that the regulation of NTB-A signaling and IFN-γ production is distinct from CD150. Recently, it has been suggested that SAP may act to recruit other molecules such as FynT (19Latour S. Gish G. Helgason C.D. Humphries R.K. Pawson T. Veillette A. Nat. Immun. 2001; 2: 681-690Google Scholar), and this could help drive the specificity of the signal through different SAP-associated receptors. It will be interesting to determine whether FynT also associates with NTB-A. Given that XLP patients are deficient in SAP, understanding the mechanism by which SAP helps regulate signals through NTB-A may give us insight into the pathology of XLP disease. Our preliminary data suggest that T cells from XLP patients cannot be activated through NTB-A, suggesting an important role for SAP and NTB-A in T cell activation. We have demonstrated a critical role for NTB-A in T cell activation and disease by using an NTB-A-Fc fusion protein. NTB-A-Fc was able to suppress T-dependent B cell class switching to Th1 cytokine-induced isotypes, most likely by blocking interaction with an NTB-A ligand and interfering with activation of T cells to Th1-type cells. The contribution of NTB-A to early activation events versus later effector functions is not clear. We do find that naive cells can respond to NTB-A cross-linking and that initial cross-linking with NTB-A skews development to the Th1 cell type. Stimulation of Th1 or Th2 cell clones with NTB-A has little effect (data not shown), suggesting that NTB-A may play a greater role in the early phase of activation. When tested in a Th1-mediated autoimmune disease model, EAE, NTB-A-Fc delayed the onset of disease. These results further suggest that NTB-A may play an important role in T cell activation and effector functions. The block in disease by NTB-A-Fc is not complete, and it may be the case that NTB-A-Fc does not block NTB-A activity completely. As we have shown, NTB-A exhibits weak homotypic interaction, similar to CD150 and other family members. It is possible that NTB-A-Fc may provide a weak activation signal while blocking a stronger signal at the same time. Thus, disease is not completely blocked during EAE progression. Another possibility for the lack of a complete block in disease is that other molecules important for T cell functions are present. Other co-stimulatory molecules such as ICOS have been implicated in autoimmunity (36Sperling A.I. Bluestone J.A. Nat. Immun. 2001; 2: 573-574Google Scholar, 37Ozkaynak E. Gao W. Shemmeri N. Wang C.

Coyle A.J. Nat. Immun. 2001; 2: 597-604Google Scholar). How NTB-A regulates T cell function along with other co-stimulatory molecules will be an interesting focus. Our results suggest an important role for NTB-A in T cell-mediated functions, including T cell activation and T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. The identification of NTB-A as a new SAP-associated receptor may help to further understand the XLP disease process in human patients. Our findings implicate a role for NTB-A in T cell activation, suggesting a possible mechanism by which SAP-deficient T cells fail in their response to pathogens, including virally infected cells and tumor cells. The identification of NTB-A and new SAP-associated receptors, as well as understanding the signaling mechanisms involved, will help shed new light on XLP disease. Given its role as a co-stimulatory molecule, inducing proliferation and IFN-γ secretion by T cells, as well as the ability of the fusion protein to suppress Th1-induced isotype switching and EAE, NTB-A is a potential target for therapeutic intervention in Th1-type autoimmune disease as well as inflammation.

CooA is a CO-sensing heme protein from the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum, which can grow anaerobically using CO as a sole energy source (1Kerby R.L. Hong S.S. Ensign S.A. Coppoc L.J. Ludden P.W.

The heme group of one subunit is coordinated to the Nα atom of the N-terminal Pro-2 residue from the adjacent subunit in the symmetric dimer. Upon reduction of the ferric form of the protein, the proximal Cys-75 ligand, is replaced by His-77, (4Shelver D. Kerby R.L. He Y.P. Roberts G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The active, DNA-binding structure of the closely related CAP protein has been known for some time (8Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), but the inactive structure (i.e. lacking the cAMP effector) has not been determined. The conformational change that occurs upon effector binding is poorly understood. However, active CooA almost certainly assumes a conformation approximately similar to that of the CAP protein (Fig. 1), given its amino acid sequence homology and specificity for similar DNA sequences. Comparison of the active form of CAP to the inactive form of CooA suggests that CO binding to the heme is communicated to the DNA-binding regions by repositioning of the C-helices (6Lanzilotta W.N.

The C-helices run the length of each dimer subunit, passing close to the heme and ending at the DNA-binding domain. Helix repositioning appears to be initiated by displacement of Pro-2 when CO binds to the heme iron. The CO-binding pocket of CooA-CO appears to be tightly packed. Geminate recombination of CO is remarkably rapid, τ = ∼70 and ∼300 ps, indicating sequestering of the photodissociated CO in the immediate vicinity of the iron atom (12Uchida T. Ishikawa H.

Details regarding CO-binding pocket interactions and axial coordination geometry are emerging from spectroscopic studies of CooA variants, and a model for the protein conformational change was recently proposed (15Coyle C.M.

In the present work the equilibria and kinetics of CO binding to CooA have been measured and used to develop a kinetic model that can explain cooperative CO binding in terms of two successive Pro-2 displacement reactions. Rates of CO binding to and release from CooA were measured in stopped-flow, rapid mixing experiments. Studies were performed with both wild-type protein and a truncated CooA variant, ΔP3R4, in which the N terminus of each subunit is shortened by about 6 Å, causing strain on the Pro-2–Fe(II) bond and facilitating its dissociation. Direct determination of the rate constants for Pro-2 coordination and CO binding to five-coordinate heme intermediates was achieved by analyzing nanosecond and microsecond laser photolysis experiments and monitoring rebinding by absorbance and resonance Raman changes. Our results indicate that Pro-2 coordination serves to inhibit CO binding to prevent transcriptional activation unless the bacteria are exposed to moderately high and sustained levels of CO. Sample Preparation—CooA was purified as previously described (16Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F. Parks R.B. Burstyn J.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2669-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), stored in 25 mm MOPS/0.1 m NaCl (pH 7.4), and then diluted into an appropriate buffer solution to give concentrations of ∼2–5 μm for the equilibrium binding titrations, ∼5–25 μm for the rapid mixing experiments, and ∼50 μm for time-resolved resonance Raman and microsecond laser photolysis experiments. CooA concentrations are expressed in terms of heme. CooA and its CO adduct were prepared by adding the protein to a syringe or cuvette that contained buffer equilibrated with 1 atm of N2 or CO/N2 mixtures, respectively. If not stated otherwise, solid sodium dithionite (∼100 μm) was added to the buffer prior to protein addition to reduce CooA[Fe(III)] to CooA[Fe(II)] and scavenge any residual O2. The oxidation state, extent of CO binding, and heme concentrations were confirmed by recording UV-visible absorption spectra (Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer). A Shindengen pH meter was used to measure the pH values of the solutions. Determination of Equilibrium Constants for CO Binding—CO binding to CooA was monitored by spectral changes in the 400- to 600-nm region of the visible spectrum (Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer), and absorbance changes (ΔA) in the Soret wavelength region were used to determine fractional saturation, Y. Each cuvette was filled with 1.5 ml of 3.8 μm wild-type CooA in 25 mm MOPS, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4. Two stock solutions were prepared, both containing 150 mm sodium dithionite. One was purged with argon, and the other with CO, both at 1 atm; the concentration of dissolved CO was assumed to be 1000 μm. The CooA sample was titrated by making mixtures of the two stock solutions in a Hamilton syringe and then adding 20 μl of the appropriate mixture to each cuvette to obtain the concentration of CO needed. A separate CO/CooA mixture was prepared for each spectrum shown below in Fig. 2A. The cuvette headspace was minimized to ∼30 μl, approximately equal to the volume of the added solution, to avoid degassing of CO. Complete saturation of CooA was achieved by addition of 1 atm of CO gas. The concentration of CO was corrected for the bound fraction: [CO] = [CO]total - Y × [CooA]total, because CO binds tightly to CooA. The fractional saturation, Y, was determined experimentally by the fractional change between the absorbance of the CooA/CO mixture and that of the unliganded protein normalized to the maximum change, at 1 atm CO: Y = ΔA/ΔAmax. The data were initially fitted to the Hill equation, Y=[CO]nKH+[CO]n(Eq. 1) where KH is defined as the Hill equilibrium constant for the dissociation of n ligand molecules from the protein. [CO] was initially set to [CO]total and then iteratively readjusted by the calculated value of Y until convergence occurred. The final parameters obtained by the above procedure were applied to Reaction 1 and Equation 2 to extract Adair constants, (CooA)2+COK1=k1/k−1 k1⇌k−1(CooA)2(CO)+COK2=k2/k−2 k2⇌k−2(CooA)2(CO)2Reaction 1 Y=k1[CO]+2k1k2[CO]22(1+K1[CO]+K1K2[CO]2)(Eq. 2) where K1 and K2 are the association equilibrium constants for the binding of the first and second CO molecules to the CooA dimer. Determination of CO Association Rate Constants by Rapid Mixing— Reduced CooA was mixed with CO at various concentrations, and binding was followed by measuring absorbance changes in the visible or Soret wavelength regions. In one set of experiments, ∼25 μm CooA was mixed with CO and visible spectra from 335 to 650 nm were recorded using a HI-TECH Scientific SF-61 DX2 Double Mixing Stopped-Flow System in diode array mode. In other experiments (Fig. 5), a Gibson-Dionex stopped-flow apparatus equipped with an OLIS data collection system was used to mix 5 μm CooA with various concentrations of CO while monitoring the absorbance at wavelengths in the Soret band region. Detection in the Soret wavelength region permitted use of dilute CooA and a wider range of CO concentrations. Determination of CO Dissociation Rate Constants—Two types of experiments were used to examine CO dissociation from CooA-CO. In the first, a solution of the CO adduct (5 μm) was rapidly mixed with 1 mm NO, and the displacement of CO was measured by the absorbance change at 422 nm. In the second experiment, the CO adduct was rapidly mixed with H64L mesoheme deoxyMb, which acts as an efficient scavenger of CO (k′CO ≈ 30 μm-1 s-1, KCO ≈ 11,000 μm-1) and has a Soret peak for MbCO at ∼416 nm. The decrease in absorbance due to the loss of CO from CooA-CO was again monitored at 422 nm. In both cases the solution contained little or no free CO, and conditions were adjusted so that the rate-limiting step was CO dissociation. Flash Photolysis of CooA-CO; Absorbance Measurements—Two types of experiments were conducted. In the first, time-resolved UV-visible spectra were recorded to identify and characterize the intermediates in CO rebinding after short, ∼7-ns, YAG laser excitation pulses (Spectra Physics Quanta Ray GCR-170 Nd:YAG laser/MOPO-710 operated at 10 Hz with 20-mJ pump pulses). The configuration of photolysis laser and UV-visible probe laser has been described (17Moffet D.A. Case M.A. House J.C. Vogel K. Williams R.D. Spiro T.G. McLendon G.L. Hecht M.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2109-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A solution of the CO adduct was transferred to an airtight 2-mm path length quartz cuvette that had been flushed with 1 atm of CO. The protein was excited at 535 nm, in the β absorption band of the heme group. UV-visible absorption spectra before and after the pump pulse were acquired at different time intervals (10 ns to 10 ms after photolysis). Difference spectra were calculated by subtracting the spectrum of the unphotolyzed complex from the pumped spectra. Each time point was averaged over 16 shots, and a background difference spectrum, acquired without the pump pulse, was subtracted from the difference spectra. Data analysis was performed with MATLAB (Mathworks Inc.). Rate constants and basis spectra for the absorbance changes were extracted by singular value decomposition of time/wavelength/intensity matrices as described by Hofrichter et al. (18Hofrichter J. Ansari A. Jones C.M. Duetsch R.M. Sommer J.H. Henry E.R. Hemoglobins. 1994; 232: 387-415Google Scholar). In the second set of experiments, CO rebinding was measured after excitation with an intense ∼0.3-μs pulse from a Phaser-2100B dye laser using rhodamine 577 in ethanol. In these experiments, 30–50 μm CooA-CO was placed in a 1-mm path length cuvette containing a small amount of sodium dithionite and an appropriate concentration of CO. Because complete photolysis could be achieved, the dye laser system was used to determine the kinetic parameters that define the competition between CO rebinding and Pro-2 coordination to five-coordinate intermediates. Time courses were recorded at multiple [CO], fitted to exponential expressions, and analyzed in terms of the dependences of the fast and slow phase rates and amplitudes on CO concentration as described by Hargrove (19Hargrove M.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for similar six-coordinate plant HbCO systems. The rapid phase was followed at 420 nm, the Soret peak for CooA-CO, and represents CO recombination to five-coordinate heme on 50- to 500-μs time scales. The slow phase was followed at ∼429 nm, close to the Soret absorbance maximum of reduced hexacoordinate CooA, and represents CO displacement of recombined Pro-2 on 0.1- to 10-s time scales. The dye laser was also used to determine the overall quantum yield for complete photolysis of CooA-CO, using MbCO as a reference (20Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. Mckinnie R.E. Rohlfs R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 228-239Google Scholar). The value obtained, qoverall ≈ ∼0.02 for CooA-CO, is in agreement with the more direct picosecond rebinding studies of Aono and coworkers (12Uchida T.

Time-resolved Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—The experimental setup for the time-resolved resonance Raman measurements has been described elsewhere (21Zhao X.J. Chen R.P. Tengroth C. Spiro T.G. Appl. Spectrosc. 1999; 53: 1200-1205Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 22Zhao X.J. Balakrishnan G. Moore E.G. Spiro T.G. J. Raman Spectrosc. 2000; 31: 349-352Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The second harmonic of a Q-switched Nd:YLF laser (Photonics International GM-30-527) was used to pump a Ti:sapphire laser (Photonics International TU-UV), which gave a narrowed laser frequency output (<0.1 cm-1) tunable between 810 and 920 nm. The Ti:S laser output (∼25 ns at 1 kHz) was frequency doubled using a non-linear lithium triborate crystal to get a 419-nm pulse. A parallel laser system was used to obtain 426-nm probe pulses. The optimum pump laser power to achieve maximum photolysis was 140 milliwatts. Photolysis due to the probe laser itself was minimized by keeping the power at ∼1 milliwatt. A DG535 delay generator controlled the time delay between the two laser pulses (200 ns to 300 μs). The beams were overlapped and then focused with a pair of cylindrical lenses onto the sample. The sample solution was contained in a NMR tube and spun around a stationary stirring wire for vertical mixing of the sample. Above the sample surface a continuous stream of CO was delivered through a stainless-steel tube to maintain the CO concentration at 1 mm. The scattered light was collected and focused onto a single spectrograph (SPEX 1269, 3600 grooves/mm) equipped with a gated intensified photo diode array detector. Six 30-s acquisition scans were averaged. Spectra were calibrated with acetone, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane. The spectra were deconvoluted using the GRAMS/32 version 5.10 software. Parameters for the curve fitting included use of a mixed Gaussian/Lorentzian band shape and the incorporation of fixed bandwidths. The fractional composition after photolysis was calculated from the corrected intensities, e.g. f[CooA(5c)] = I[CooA(5c)]/(I[CooA(5c)] + I[CooA] + I[CooA-CO]). Multiplying f[CooA(5c)], f[CooA], and f[CooA-CO] by the total protein concentration provides the concentration of each of the species. The concentrations measured from probe-only spectra were subtracted to calculate the change in the concentration. The relative change was then obtained by dividing these numbers by the total protein concentration. Equilibrium Binding of CO Is Cooperative—CooA was carefully titrated with CO at pH 7.4 while monitoring the visible absorption spectrum (Fig. 2). The spectral changes (Fig. 2A) were used to calculate fractional saturation changes as a function of the concentration of free CO in the sample (Fig. 2B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When the binding data were analyzed in terms of the Hill equation (Equation 1), the fitted value of P50 was 2.2 μm, with n = 1.4, indicating substantial positive cooperativity; theoretical binding curves for a non-cooperative dimer (n = 1), and one showing maximum cooperativity (n = 2), are shown for comparison. The data were also used to extract Adair association constants, with fitted values of 0.17 and 1.25 μm-1 for K1 and K2, respectively (Equation 2). CO Binding Kinetics Are Biphasic and Limited by Pro-2 Dissociation—In stopped-flow mixing experiments, CO binding to reduced CooA occurs on time scales of minutes and is biphasic (Fig. 3; [CO] = 500 μm). The data, followed over 1000 s, were fit to a two exponential expression, yielding fast and slow pseudo-first-order rate constants, kf and ks. When the experiments were repeated at 250 and 100 μm CO, both rates diminished, but the changes were not proportional to [CO]. This result suggested rate limitation by a step prior to CO binding, presumably dissociation of the coordinated internal Pro-2 ligand present in reduced CooA dimers (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Scheme for CO binding to hexacoordinate CooA with a transient five-coordinate Fe(II)-His intermediate that reacts rapidly with endogenous Pro-2 or exogenous CO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This interpretation is supported by the time course for CO binding to the CooA variant, ΔP3R4, in which residues Pro-3 and Arg-4 are deleted (Fig. 3) (23Youn H. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2333-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This variant is fully active in the presence of CO, and the Fe(II) form is predominantly six-coordinate and low spin, suggesting that Pro-2 remains bound to the heme. However, the ligand field is weaker (15Coyle C.M. Puranik M. Youn H. Nielsen S.B. Williams R.D. Roberts G.P. Spiro T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35384-35393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), indicating that shortening the N terminus strains the Pro-2–Fe bond. Consistent with this finding, the pseudo first order rate constant for the fast phase at 500 μm [CO] is much larger than that for wild-type CooA, kf = 100 s-1 and 0.37 s-1 for ΔP3R4 and WT CooA, respectively. A slow phase is also seen for the ΔP3R4 variant, and its rate (ks = 0.11 s-1) is much closer to that for the slow phase of WT CooA (ks = 0.07 s-1) (Fig. 3). To define the mechanism of binding more accurately, stopped-flow experiments were conducted at lower CooA concentrations (2.5 μm), following absorbance changes at 420 nm, the Soret band maximum of the CO adduct. The [CO] was varied from 10 to 500 μm. Biphasic kinetics were still observed (Fig. 5), and the fitted values of kf and ks show a clear hyperbolic dependence on [CO] (Fig. 6). The observed fast and slow pseudo first order rate constants shown in Fig. 6 were analyzed in terms of the mechanism shown in Fig. 4, which involves the pre-dissociation of Pro-2 followed by CO binding to a transient pentacoordinate (5c) intermediate. This intermediate is spectrally undetectable in the stopped-flow experiments, because, as will be shown in the next section, the rates of bimolecular CO binding, k′CO[CO], and Pro rebinding, kPro, to the 5c intermediate are very rapid compared with the rate constant for Pro-2 dissociation, k-Pro. The latter rate constant limits the overall rate of CO binding in the rapid mixing experiments. Consequently, a steady-state assumption can be made for the rate of change of [CooA(5c)], and the observed pseudo first order rate constant for overall CO binding to CooA containing bound Pro-2 (19Hargrove M.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2733-2738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Hargrove M.S. Brucker E.A. Stec B. Sarath G. Arrendondo-Peter R. Klucas R.V. Olson J.S.

The limiting rates for both phases are the rate constants for Pro-2 dissociation, k-Pro,f and k-Pro,s. The solid lines in Fig. 6 represent fits to Equation 4, with k-Pro,f = 0.4 s-1, kPro/k′CO(fast phase) = 50 μm and k-Pro,s = 0.07 s-1, kPro/k′CO (slow phase) = 60 μm. CO Rebinding to the 5-Coordinate Intermediate—The kinetics of CO rebinding to the five-coordinate intermediate, CooA(5c), were determined via flash-photolysis techniques. Initial experiments employed short (7–25 ns) flashes and detection of early transients, using absorption or resonance Raman spectroscopy. The experiments in the next section employed longer (300 ns) flashes to achieve complete photolysis and monitor more directly the competition between CO and Pro rebinding on longer time scales. Fig. 7 shows transient absorption difference spectra, collected at 10 ns and 100 μs after CooA-CO photolysis with a 7-ns, 535-nm YAG laser pulse (Fig. 7B). These spectra have the same features (438-nm maximum and 421-nm minimum) as the transient (10 ns) difference spectrum of the CO adduct of myoglobin, MbCO (Fig. 7C) and not those of the equilibrium difference spectrum of CooA and its CO adduct (Fig. 7A). This result established that the intermediate contains a five-coordinate heme, analogous to that in deoxyMb. Moreover, singular value decomposition of time/wavelength/intensity matrices (18Hofrichter J. Ansari A. Jones C.M. Duetsch R.M. Sommer J.H. Henry E.R. Hemoglobins. 1994; 232: 387-415Google Scholar) showed that the transient absorbance changes at pH 7.4 exhibit only one basis spectrum, the one seen in Fig. 7B. However, data obtained at pH 11 (not shown) contained an additional, low amplitude basis spectrum, corresponding to the CooA/CooA-CO absorption difference spectrum. Hence, Pro-2 rebinding begins to compete with CO rebinding at high pH, even at 1000 μm CO. The absorbance changes indicated low photolysis yields at 7 ns, consistent with the fast geminate rebinding found by Aono and coworkers (12Uchida T. Ishikawa H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nakajima H. Aono S. Mizutani Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12747-12752Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The estimated yield was ∼10% at pH 7.4 but increased to ∼30% at pH 11, suggesting that more of the photogenerated CO escapes into solution at high pH. These inferences are supported by time-resolved resonance Raman spectra (Fig. 8). The intense ν4 porphyrin band (26Spiro T.G. Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. 3. John Wiley and Sons, New York1988: 1-38Google Scholar) can be resolved (Fig. 9, inset) into well separated contributions from CooA (1360 cm-1), CooA-CO (1372 cm-1), and the five-coordinate (5c) photoproduct (1356 cm-1), allowing all three to be monitored and quantitated independently.

https://openalex.org/W2072135987,"Using a differential display of mRNA technique we discovered that the juvenile hormone (JH) esterase gene (Cfjhe) from Choristoneura fumiferana is directly induced by juvenile hormone I (JH I), and the JH I induction is suppressed by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). To study the mechanism of action of these two hormones in the regulation of expression of this gene, we cloned the 1270-bp promoter region of the Cfjhe gene and identified a 30-bp region that is located between –604 and –574 and is sufficient to support both JH I induction and 20E suppression. This 30-bp region contains two conserved hormone response element half-sites separated by a 4-nucleotide spacer similar to the direct repeat 4 element and is designated as a putative juvenile hormone response element (JHRE). In CF-203 cells, a luciferase reporter placed under the control of JHRE and a minimal promoter was induced by JH I in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, 20E suppressed this JH I-induced luciferase activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Nuclear proteins isolated from JH I-treated CF-203 cells bound to JHRE and the binding was competed by a 100-fold excess of the cold probe but not by 100-fold excess of double-stranded oligonucleotides of unrelated sequence. JH I induced/modified nuclear proteins prior to their binding to JHRE and 20E suppressed this JH I induction/modification. These results suggest that the 30-bp JHRE identified in the Cfjhe gene promoter is sufficient to support JH induction and 20E suppression of the Cfjhe gene.

Through indirect action, JH was shown to modulate 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) action by affecting the expression of genes in a 20E-induced cascade (13Zhou B. Hiruma K. Shinoda T. Riddiford L.M. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Zhou X. Riddiford L.M. Development. 2002; 129: 2259-2269PubMed Google Scholar). Totally different from the above genomic actions, in ovarian follicular epithelium, JH acts through a membrane receptor to bring about rapid enzyme activation without the need for new transcription (15Sevala V.L. Davey K.G. Experientia. 1989; 45: 355-356Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Numerous attempts have been made to identify JH receptors. Palli et al. (16Palli S. Hiruma K. Riddiford L. Insect Biochem. 1991; 21: 7-15Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) used human retinoic acid receptor cDNA as a probe and identified a steroid/thyroid superfamily member from Manduca sexta. Further characterization of this cDNA revealed that this is not a JH receptor but, rather, an ecdysone-induced transcription factor that plays a critical role in ecdysone signal transduction and is related to Drosophila hormone receptor 3 (17Koelle M.R. Segraves W.A. Hogness D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6167-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), subsequently named Manduca hormone receptor 3 (18Palli S.R. Hiruma K.

The 29-kDa nuclear protein identified in M. sexta epidermis turned out to be a low affinity JH-binding protein (19Palli S.R. Touhara K. Charles J.P. Bonning B.C. Atkinson J.K. Trowell S.C. Hiruma K.

The mammalian retinoid X receptor (RXR) forms a heterodimer with several nuclear receptors including the farnesoid X-activated receptor (FXR). JH III but not JH acid or methoprene can bind/activate the FXR and RXR heterodimer (21Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J. Oro A.E. Bradley D.J. Perlmann T. Noonan D.J. Burka L.T. McMorris T. Lamph W.W. Evans R.M. Weinberger C. Cell. 1995; 81: 687-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Methoprene and methoprene acid but not JH III can activate RXR (22Harmon M.A. Boehm M.F. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6157-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These two studies suggested that RXR or its insect homologue ultraspiracle (USP) could play an important role in signal transduction of JH or JH-related compounds. Jones and Sharp (23Jones G. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13499-13503Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) showed that both JH III and JHB3 bind to a USP homodimer from Drosophila melanogaster. Subsequent studies showed that USP from D. melanogaster can bind to the DR12 response element and a reporter gene placed under the control of the DR12 response element fused to the jhe core promoter was induced by JH III (24Xu Y. Fang F. Chu Y. Jones D. Jones G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6026-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A D. melanogaster mutant tolerant to methoprene (Met) was identified (25Wilson T.G. Fabian J. Dev. Biol. 1986; 118: 190-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). An 85-kDa protein isolated from Met flies showed a 6-fold lower affinity than the wild-type protein for JH III (26Shemshedini L. Lanoue M. Wilson T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1913-1918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Met gene was cloned and found to be a member of the basic helix-loop-helix-PER-AHR/ARNT-SIM (PAS) family of transcriptional regulators (27Ashok M. Turner C. Wilson T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Met is not a vital gene, as shown by the production of a null mutant allele that is viable (28Wilson T.G. Ashok M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14040-14044Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but this finding could reflect functional redundancy of Met. The Met gene product was detected in several tissues, including known JH response tissues (29Pursley S. Ashok M. Wilson T.G. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 30: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To clone JH receptor cDNA, several approaches, including characterization of JH response gene promoters to identify JH response elements to be used for screening expression libraries to isolate JH receptors, are being pursued. Several JH-responsive genes, including calmodulin, vitellogenin, and diapause protein have been identified (9Iyengar A.R. Kunkel J.G. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Hirai M. Yuda M. Shinoda T. Chinzei Y. Insect Biochem. Mol.

Another JH response gene, jhp21, was identified in Locusta migratoria, and a response element has been identified in the promoter region of this gene (6Zhang J. Saleh D.S. Wyatt G.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 122: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Characterization of protein that binds to this response element lead to the hypothesis that this protein is a transcription factor activated by JH and that participates in regulation of expression of JH response genes (31Zhou S.

Most of these genes show a relatively slow rate of induction in response to JH application indicating that they may not be directly regulated by a JH-receptor complex. In Manduca sexta fat body cells, a JH-binding protein gene is induced by JH I within 2 h of application and appears to be a primary response gene (32Orth A.P. Lan Q. Goodman W.G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 149: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CF-203 cells were developed from larval midguts of Choristoneura fumiferana and respond to both 20E and JH (8Feng Q.L.

Sohi S.S. Cook B.J. Retnakaran A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We have used differential display of mRNAs technique and identified Cfjhe gene as a primary JH response gene (8Feng Q.L. Ladd T.R. Tomkins B.L. Sundaram M. Sohi S.S. Retnakaran A. Davey K.G. Palli S.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 148: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This gene is directly induced by JH I within 1 h after adding the hormone even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. The expression of Cfjhe gene is completely suppressed by 20E even in the presence of cycloheximide. Both induction by JH I and suppression by 20E are dose- and time-dependent (8Feng Q.L. Ladd T.R. Tomkins B.L. Sundaram M. Sohi S.S. Retnakaran A. Davey K.G. Palli S.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 148: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the Cfjhe gene is one of the few examples of genes whose expression is directly regulated by both JH and 20E. Identification and characterization of the promoter region of Cfjhe gene is essential for studying the mechanism of JH induction and 20E suppression of Cfjhe gene expression. We screened a C. fumiferana genomic library and identified a 1270-bp fragment that is located upstream of the Cfjhe gene transcription start site. Analysis of this 1270-bp genomic fragment using reporter assays in CF-203 cells identified a 30-bp region located between –604 and –574 that is sufficient to support both JH induction and 20E suppression of JH induction of Cfjhe gene. Nuclear proteins isolated from CF-203 cells that were exposed to JH specifically bound to this 30-bp JH response region. CF-203 Cells—CF-203, a continuous cell line was developed from the midgut of C. fumiferana (33Sohi S.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 39: 397-412PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were grown in SF 900 (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells grow attached to the substrate and were subcultured by trypsinization for a short time using 0.05% trypsin solution (Invitrogen). New cultures were seeded at 1.5 × 105 cells/ml medium in 5-ml flasks and kept at 28 °C. They were subcultured every 3–4 days during which time they grew to about 1.5 × 106 cells/ml. Transfection—CF-203 cells were set up at 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates. The next day, 5 μg of DNA was mixed separately and made up to 100 μl with neat SF900 medium. In a separate tube 15 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 was mixed with 85 μl of neat SF900 medium and was left for 30 min at room temperature. Both the solutions (100 μl of DNA mix plus 100 μl of lipofectomine 2000 mix equals 200 μl of transfection mix) were combined and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were treated with trypsin for about 10 s and were washed twice with neat SF900 medium. Then, 800 μl of neat SF900 was mixed with 200 μl of transfection mix, and the mixture was added to the cells in each well. After rocking the cells for 24 h, the transfection mixture was removed and 2 ml of fresh growth medium (SF900 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum) containing hormones was added to each well. Cells were collected at 24 h after adding the hormones. To harvest cells, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer was added to each well and the cells were collected and assayed for luciferase reporter activity using the Luciferase™ reporter assay system from Promega (Madison, WI). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—The cells were collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was disrupted in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, homogenized, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 100 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.4 m (NH4)2SO4). After incubation for 30 min on ice, the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The nuclear proteins were precipitated by adding 0.3 g/ml (NH4)2SO4 followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the precipitate was dissolved in nuclear dialysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT) and dialyzed against 200 ml of the same buffer for 12 h. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was stored at –80 °C. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—To test the binding of JHRE to nuclear proteins isolated form CF-203 cells, we produced double-stranded DNA probes by synthesizing complimentary oligonucleotides based on 30-bp JHRE (5′-CCCTTATAAAAAGATTATTATAGATTATTA-3′). The oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and purified by passing them through a Sephadex G-50 column. The labeled oligonucleotides were then annealed to produce a double-stranded probe. DNA-binding reactions were carried out in a 20-μl volume containing 5–6 μg of nuclear extract, 2 μl of 10× assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 20 μm single-stranded, nonspecific DNA. After 20-min incubation at room temperature, 0.05 pmol of labeled probe was added and the incubation continued for another 20 min at room temperature. For the competition experiments, unlabeled double-stranded probe or double-stranded oligonucleotides of unrelated sequence, but of the same length as the probe and used at a concentration of 100-fold molar excess, were added to the binding reaction at the same time as the labeled probe. Free and protein-bound DNA complexes were separated on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer at a constant voltage of 100. The gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film using an intensifying screen and kept at –80 °C. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers, 5′-GTACCCTTATAAAAAAATTATTATAGATTATTATG-3′, 5′-CTTATAAAAAGATTATTATAAATTATTATGGAAAC-3′, 5′-CCGTGTATGGACAAAGTCATCAGAGTTTGATAG-3′, and their complements were used for producing mutants G-598A, G-588A, and G-208A, respectively. Genomic Library Construction and Screening—A genomic library was constructed using genomic DNA isolated from the spruce budworm larvae and EMBL3 genomic library construction kit form Promega (Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. A library containing 500,000 clones with an average insert size of 20 kb was prepared. The genomic library was screened using CfJHE cDNA as probe and following the methods described for cDNA library screening (35Palli S.R. Ladd T.R. Sohi S.S. Cook B.J. Retnakaran A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Identification Cfjhe Promoter Region—To identify JH and 20E response regions in the Cfjhe promoter, we screened a C. fumiferana genomic library with Cfjhe gene cDNA as a probe and identified six genomic clones with an average insert size of 20 kb. Restriction digestion of phage DNA followed by Southern blotting and hybridization using the Cfjhe gene cDNA as a probe identified a genomic fragment containing a 1270-bp region that is located upstream to the transcription start site. This genomic fragment was subcloned into pBSK– (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced completely from both directions (Fig. 1). The sequence of this genomic fragment showed a conserved transcription start site at 27 bp upstream from the JHE mRNA translation start site (8Feng Q.L. Ladd T.R. Tomkins B.L. Sundaram M. Sohi S.S. Retnakaran A. Davey K.G. Palli S.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 148: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and a typical TATA box at 22 bp upstream to the transcription start site. A search of the 1270-bp sequence (–1 to –1270) that is present upstream to the transcription start site using Patch, Match, and AliBaba2 programs available at TRANSFAC public site (transfac.gbf.de/) showed a match with half-sites of several known response elements (REs), including hsp27EcRE, TATAA-binding protein, FXRRE, RXRRE, and E74RE. However, when considered together, both half-sites of none of these REs showed a significant match with the 1270-bp sequence. Some of the putative REs are shown in Fig. 1. This sequence also contained a repeat of 161-bp sequence separated by 93-bp sequence (boxed in Fig. 1). This 1270-bp sequence showed 61% identity with the 1200-bp nucleotide sequence found in the 5′ flanking region of Trichoplusia ni jhe (36Venkataraman V. O'Mahony P.J. Manzcak M. Jones G. Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). But, a hormone response element that is similar to DR-1 RE identified in T. ni jhe promoter is not found in the Cfjhe promoter. Identification of the JH Response Region—We prepared six 5′ to 3′ truncations of the 1270-bp Cfjhe promoter region and cloned them into pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega Corp.). The nucleotide sequence is numbered relative to the transcription start site of CfJHE mRNA. The 27-nucleotide sequence that is present between transcription and translation start site of CfJHE mRNA was included in all constructs. These six constructs were assayed in CF-203 cells. The constructs that contained the Cfjhe promoter region from –1270 to +1, –1013 to +1, –956 to +1, and –641 to +1 showed 10- to 15-fold induction of luciferase reporter activity in the presence of JH I when compared with the activity in the presence of Me2SO (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the constructs that contained the Cfjhe promoter region from –424 to +1 showed only 2-fold induction, and the constructs that contained –74 to +1 did not show any induction of reporter activity in the presence of JH I. These results showed that the JH I response region in the Cfjhe promoter is located between –641 and –424 bp upstream from the transcription start site. The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) did not induce reporter activity through any of the constructs tested, but it was able to prevent JH I-induced reporter activity when both hormones were administered simultaneously. These results showed that the 217-bp region of the Cfjhe promoter that lies between –641 and –424 was able to support both JH induction and 20E suppression as observed for Cfjhe gene (8Feng Q.L. Ladd T.R. Tomkins B.L. Sundaram M. Sohi S.S. Retnakaran A. Davey K.G. Palli S.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 148: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although, the construct containing –424 to +1 showed a small increase in reporter activity in the presence of JH I, further analysis of this region did not show any JH I-mediated response. As will be shown later, the only recognizable hormone response element (a half-site) in this region, AGGTCA, present at –208 appears to play no role in JH 1 induction of the reporter gene regulated by the 1270-bp Cfjhe promoter. The 217-bp fragment that lies between –641 and –424 was further analyzed by preparing three truncations containing lengths of 217 bp (–641 to –424), 150 bp (–574- to –424), and 75 bp (–499 to –424). Each of these three fragments was fused with the Cfjhe gene core promoter (which includes a 46-bp sequence containing the TATA box and the transcription start site, –30 to +15) and cloned into pGL3-basic vector. These three truncation constructs were assayed in CF-203 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, only the construct containing the 217-bp Cfjhe promoter fragment showed induction by JH I suggesting that the JH response region in the Cfjhe promoter is located between –641 and –574 bp upstream from the transcription start site. We prepared three truncations of the 67-bp fragment that lies between –641 and –574. Three fragments of the Cfjhe promoter 67 bp (–641 to –574), 50 bp (–624 to –574), and 30 bp (–604 to –574) were fused to the Cfjhe gene core promoter (–30 to +15) and cloned into pGL3-basic vector and assayed in CF-203 cells. All three constructs showed 10- to 15-fold induction of reporter activity in JH I-treated cells when compared with the reporter activity in Me2SO-treated cells indicating that the 30-bp region between –604 and –574 is sufficient for a JH induced response observed for Cfjhe gene (Fig. 4). This sequence contains direct repeat elements separated by a four-nucleotide spacer and shows 100% identity with consensus direct repeat 4 (DR4) element (Fig. 1). This 30-bp region is designated as a putative juvenile hormone response element (JHRE). JHRE Is Sufficient to Support JH Induction and 20E Suppression—To test if the 30-bp fragment that supported JH I induction is also sufficient for 20E suppression of JH I-induced reporter activity, we transfected pGL3JHRE(1270) (where the luciferase reporter was regulated by the 1270-bp fragment) or pGL3JHRE (30Glinka A.V. Kleiman A.M. Wyatt G.R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 35: 323-328PubMed Google Scholar) (where the luciferase reporter gene is regulated by 30-bp JHRE fused to the Cfjhe gene core promoter, –30 to +15) or pGL3 alone into CF-203 cells. The transfected cells were exposed to Me2SO, JH I, 20E, or JH I plus 20E. As shown in Fig. 5A, the 30-bp region from the Cfjhe promoter is sufficient to support JH I induction as well as 20E suppression of JH I-induced reporter activity. The luciferase reporter in pGL3 vector was not induced by either JH I or 20E or both in combination. Dose response and Time Course of JH I Induction—The JH I induction of reporter activity through the 30-bp Cfjhe promoter is both JH I dose- and exposure time-dependent. The induction of reporter activity started at as low as 40 nm JH I and increased with the increased concentration of JH I and reached peak levels at 1000 nm concentration of JH I (Fig. 5B). There was a slight decrease in reporter activity at higher concentration of JH I (5000 nm). This may be due to the cytotoxicity of hormone to the cells. The induction of reporter activity increased with an increase in time and reached peak levels by 24 h after adding the hormone (Fig. 5C). There was a decrease in reporter activity by 48 and 72 h after adding hormone. Nuclear Proteins Isolated from CF-203 Cells Specifically Bind to JHRE—To determine whether JHRE from the Cfjhe promoter binds to nuclear proteins that are present in CF-203 cells, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Nuclear extracts were prepared from JH I-treated and Me2SO-treated CF-203 cells, and the nuclear proteins were incubated with end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides synthesized based on 30-bp JHRE sequence (Table I). As shown in Fig. 6A, the nuclear proteins isolated from JH I-treated CF-203 cells bound to the JHRE, and the binding was competed by a 100-fold excess cold probe but not by a 100-fold excess double-stranded oligonucleotides of unrelated sequence indicating that the binding is specific. To determine if nuclear proteins that bind to JHRE need prior exposure to JH, we cultured CF-203 cells in the presence of Me2SO or 1 μm JH I for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, and the nuclear proteins were isolated and assayed by EMSA. Nuclear proteins from the cells that were exposed to JH I, but not from the cells that were exposed to Me2SO, bound to JHRE suggesting that JH I induces/modifies one or more nuclear proteins that bind to JHRE (Fig. 6B). To test whether 20E suppresses JH I induction/modification of nuclear proteins prior to their binding to JHRE, we cultured CF-203 cells in medium containing Me2SO or 1 μm JHIor1 μm 20E or 1 μm each of JH I and 20E for 24 h, the nuclear proteins were isolated and analyzed for their binding to JHRE by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 6C, nuclear proteins isolated from JH I-treated cells bound to JHRE, but the nuclear proteins isolated from Me2SO, 20E, or 20E plus JH I treated cells did not bind to JHRE. These data show that JH I induces/modifies nuclear proteins prior to their binding to JHRE and that 20E can suppress this action of JH I.Table IPrimers used in the mutagenesis experimentWTCCCTTATAAAAAGATTATTATAGATTATTAM1CCCTTATAAAAAGATTATTATAAATTATTAM2CCCTTATAAAAAAATTATTATAAATTATTAM3CCCTTATAAAAAAATTATTATAGATTATTAM4CCCTTATAAAAAGATTATTATAGATTATTATAM5TTATAAAAAGATTATTATAGATTATTATAM6TAAAAAGATTATTATAGATTATTATAM7AAAGATTATTATAGATTATTATAM8GATTATTATAGATTATTATAM9TAAAATGATTATTATTGATTATTATAM10TAAAAAAATTATTATAAATTATTATAM11TAAAAAGATTTTTATAGATTTTTATAM12TAAAAAGTTTATTATAGTTTATTATAM13TAAAAAGATAATTATAGATAATTATAM14TAAAAAGGTCATTATAGGTCATTATA Open table in a new tab Identification of Nucleotides Critical for Binding of 30-bp JHRE to Nuclear Proteins—To further characterize JHRE and to identify nucleotides critical for binding to nuclear proteins, we produced mutant versions of 30-bp JHRE (Table I) and used them in competition experiments. Nuclear proteins isolated from CF-203 cells bound to the 30-bp JHRE and the binding was competed by 25-fold excess cold probe (Fig. 7A). A 25-fold excess of a 30-bp oligonucleotide containing a mutation changing G to A in the left half-site (MI, Table I) or in both the half-sites (M2, Table I) or in the right half-site (M3, Table I) showed reduced competition (Fig. 7B). These results showed that G residues present in repeat elements are important for binding of nuclear proteins to this JHRE. To determine the influence of nucleotides upstream to the repeat elements, truncated oligonucleotides where some of the nucleotides at the 5′ end of JHRE were eliminated were synthesized (M5–M8, Table I). These truncated oligonucleotides showed reduction in competition as more nucleotides were eliminated (Fig. 7). Mutant 8, in which all nucleotides upstream to the repeat elements were eliminated, showed significantly less competition when compared with the cold probe. The 30-bp JHRE we identified through promoter analysis had two nucleotides (TA) missing at the 3′ end of the second repeat. We produced a 32-bp oligonucleotide that included these two nucleotides (M4, Table I). The 32-bp JHRE competed well for the binding of 30-bp JHRE to nuclear proteins. The above results showed that the G residue in the AGATTA repeat is critical for binding of nuclear proteins to JHRE. These results also showed that most of the residues that are present upstream to the AGATTA sequence are not very important in binding of nuclear proteins to JHRE suggesting that the two AGATTA direct repeat elements with a 4-nucleotide spacer is probably the binding site for nuclear proteins. Consequently, we prepared six additional mutants of JHRE (M9 –M14) changing conserved nucleotides in the AGATTA element to non-conserved residues (the consensus sequence for DR4 is RGRNYANNNNRGRNYA, where R = AorG,N = A, G, T, or C, and Y = A or T). In mutant 14, the AGATTA was changed to AGGTCA, a common half-site found in hormone response elements. Analysis of these mutants by EMSA showed that Mutants 10, 11, and 12 showed significantly less competition when compared with the other mutants. These three mutants had changes in conserved residues of the DR4 element (mutant 10; G in AGATTA was changed to A, mutant 11; the sixth residue, A in AGATTA was changed to T and mutant 12; the third residues in AGATTA changed to T) (Fig. 8, A and B). Mutant 14, where the AGATTA elements were changed to AGGTCA, competed well with the probe for binding of nuclear proteins (Fig. 8, A and B). These data suggest that the DR4 element present in the 30-bp JHRE is responsible for binding to nuclear proteins isolated from CF-203 cells. To determine whether the G residue in the AGATTA element that is critical for binding of nuclear proteins is also important for JH I induction of a reporter gene placed under the control of JHRE, we prepared three mutants of pGL3JHRE(1270) where the G residues in each AGATTA element (G-588A and G-598A) as well as the G residue in AGGTCA found at –208 were changed to A (G-208A). Analysis of mutant and wild type (WT) constructs in CF-203 cells showed that both mutants where G residues in AGATTA element was changed to A (G-588A and G-598A) reduced JH I induction of reporter gene by 70% when compared with WT (Fig. 9). The suppression by 20E worked in these mutants, because 20E was able to reduce JH I-induced reporter activity. On the other hand, changes to G residues in AGGTCA at –208 (G-208A) did not effect JH I induction or 20E suppression. These data suggest that the G residues in the DR4 element present in the Cfjhe promoter are important for JH I induction of this gene. The major contribution of current study is the identification of a 30-bp JHRE within the Cfjhe promoter that is sufficient for JH induction and 20E suppression of this induction observed for Cfjhe gene. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, when the luciferase gene was placed under the control of this 30-bp JHRE and the Cfjhe core promoter (–25 to +15), JH I induced reporter activity, and, in turn, 20E suppressed this JH I-induced reporter activity. Second, nuclear proteins isolated from CF-203 cells exposed to JH I specifically bound to this 30-bp JHRE. Third, other regions of the 1270-bp Cfjhe promoter did not support JH I induction. Taken together, these data conclusively show that the identified 30-bp JHRE is responsible for the JH induction and 20E suppression observed for the Cfjhe gene (8Feng Q.L. Ladd T.R. Tomkins B.L. Sundaram M. Sohi S.S. Retnakaran A. Davey K.G. Palli S.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 148: 95-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 30-bp JHRE contains two direct repeats of AGATTA with a four nucleotide spacer and these elements show 100% similarity with the consensus DR4 element (RGRNYANNNNRGRNYA, where R = A or G, N = A or G or T or C and Y = A or T). Mutagenesis experiments showed that changing the two residues G and A that are present in the consensus DR4 elements to A and T respectively, significantly reduced its competition with WT probe for binding to nuclear proteins suggesting that these two residues are critical for binding of nuclear proteins to these JHRE. Mutagenesis experiments also showed that the oligonucleotides containing two AGGTCA (common hormone response element half-site) elements that are separated by a 4-nucleotide spacer competed well with WT 30-bp JHRE probe for binding of nuclear proteins isolated from CF-203 cells. These results suggest that the DR4 elements present in the Cfjhe promoter are involved in binding of nuclear proteins isolated from CF-203 cells. In transactivation assays, the mutant versions of the 1270-bp Cfjhe promoter in which the G in each of the AGATTA element in the 30-bp JHRE was mutated to A (G-588A and G-598A) reduced JH I induction by 70%. On the other hand, changing of G to A (G-208A) in AGGTCA single element found at –208 of Cfjhe promoter did not effect JH I induction of luciferase gene regulated by the Cfjhe promoter. These data suggest that the DR4 elements present in the promoter region of the Cfjhe gene are involved in JH induction. The JHRE (GAGGTTCGAG(A/T)CCT(T/C)) found in the promoter region of another JH-induced gene, jhp21, from L. migratoria (6Zhang J. Saleh D.S. Wyatt G.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 122: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 31Zhou S. Zhang J. Hirai M. Chinzei Y. Kayser H. Wyatt G.R. Walker V.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 190: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) resemble known hormone response elements especially the IR-1 (inverted repeat elements with one spacer). Ecdysone receptor and ultraspiracle complexes bind to both DR4 and IR-1 elements (37Wang S.F. Miura K. Miksicek R.J. Segraves W.A. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27531-27540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The aGATTa motif present in each of the two repeat sequences in JHRE is similar to some of the GATA binding sites identified in the promoter region of the vitellogenin gene from Aedea aegypti (38Kokoza V.A. Martin D. Mienaltowski M.J. Ahmed A. Morton C.M. Raikhel A.S. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 274: 47-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine if the GATA family of transcription factors can bind to JHRE identified in the Cfjhe promoter, we performed supershift in EMSA using antibodies made against BmGATAβ2 protein (39Drevet J.R. Skeiky Y.A. Iatrou K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10660-10667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These antibodies did not supershift the JHRE-nuclear protein complexes indicating that the nuclear proteins binding to JHRE are not similar to BmGATAβ2 protein (data not shown). Nuclear proteins isolated from CF-203 cells that were exposed to JH I but not to Me2SO bound specifically to the 30-bp JH response region of the Cfjhe promoter indicating that JH I either induces the expression of mRNA or modifies the nuclear proteins prior to their binding to JHRE. Because only short exposure of 3 h to JH I is sufficient to increase the nuclear protein binding to JHRE, we favor the hypothesis that the nuclear proteins that bind to JHRE are modified rather than their mRNA expression being induced by JH I. Nuclear proteins that bind to the JHRE present in the promoter region of jhp21 gene from L. migratoria are phosphorylated through C-type protein kinase that prevents them from binding to JHRE (31Zhou S. Zhang J. Hirai M. Chinzei Y. Kayser H. Wyatt G.R. Walker V.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 190: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is likely that the nuclear proteins that bind to JHRE present in the Cfjhe promoter are also phosphorylated, and phosphorylated nuclear proteins may not be able to bind to JHRE. However, exposure to JH I might result in dephosphorylation of nuclear proteins leading to their binding to JHRE. Experiments are in progress to test this hypothesis. The identified JHRE would be useful for cloning cDNAs for receptors/transcription factors through which JH/20E transduce their signals to bring about opposite effects on the expression of Cfjhe gene. The JHRE identified would also be useful for developing reporter-based assays to screen for new more potent environmentally friendly JH analogs for controlling pests and disease vectors.

https://openalex.org/W1965875870,"By using the MIN6 cell line and pancreatic islets, we show that in the presence of a low glucose concentration, corresponding to physiological glucagon release from α cells, glucagon treatment of the β cell caused a rapid, time-dependent phosphorylation and activation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) independently from extracellular calcium influx. Inhibition of either cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or MEK completely blocked ERK1/2 activation by glucagon. However, no significant activation of several upstream activators of MEK, including Shc-p21Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, was observed in response to glucagon treatment. Chelation of intracellular calcium (intracellular [Ca2+]) reduced glucagon-mediated ERK1/2 activation. In addition, internalization of glucagon receptors through clathrin-coated pits formation is required for ERK1/2 activation. Remarkably, glucagon promotes the nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 and induces the phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Miniglucagon, produced from glucagon and released together with the mother hormone from the α cells in low glucose situations, blocks the insulinotropic effect of glucagon, whereas it does not inhibit the glucagon-induced PKA/ERK1/2/CREB pathway. We conclude that glucagon-induced ERK1/2 activation is mediated by PKA and that an increase in [Ca2+]i is required for maximal ERK activation. Our results uncover a novel mechanism by which the PKA/ERK1/2 signaling network engaged by glucagon, in situation of low glucose concentration, regulates phosphorylation of CREB, a transcription factor crucial for normal β cell function and survival.

Diabetologia. 1995; 38: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Glucagon has been shown to potentiate the glucose-stimulated insulin release from β cell lines and from pancreatic islets (9Dalle S. Smith P. Blache P. Le-Nguyen D. Le Brigand L. Bergeron F.

In β cells models, glucagon increases cAMP, activates PKA which, in turn, phosphorylates the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC), leading to an increased glucose-induced calcium entry elicited through membrane depolarization, thus potentiating insulin secretion (9Dalle S.

This observation is intriguing and paradoxical in that glucagon, which exhibits gluconeogenetic and glycogenolytic effects that are necessary for fighting against hypoglycemia, is also able to release insulin that drives the system in the opposite direction (3Unger R.H. Orci L. de Groot L.J. Endocrinology. 3rd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1995: 1337-1353Google Scholar, 4Cryer P.E. Horm.

LeNguyen D. Bataille D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that miniglucagon, the C-terminal glucagon fragment also present in mature secretory granules of the α cells, is released together with glucagon in a low glucose situation (hypoglycemia). Miniglucagon completely blocks any possible insulinotropic action of glucagon, because this peptide is very potent in inhibiting insulin release by closing the β cell VDCC consecutively to plasma membrane repolarization (9Dalle S.

Fully consistent with these findings, endogenously released glucagon from α cells has no effect on the magnitude of glucose-induced insulin secretion (13Moens K. Berger V. Ahn J.M. Van Schravendijk C. Hruby V.J. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although exogenous glucagon stimulates insulin secretion. On the other hand, glucagon has been shown to exert important long term effects on the pancreatic β cells. Glucagon contributes to the maintenance of the glucose-competent phenotype of native β cells, a key feature commonly impaired in physiopathology of type 2 diabetes (14Huypens P. Ling Z. Pipeleers D. Schuit F. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and is required for the differentiation of precursor cells into insulin-secreting β cells in the embryonic pancreas (15Prasadan K. Daume E. Preuett B. Spilde T. Bhatia A. Kobayashi H. Hembree M. Manna P. Gittes G.K. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 3220-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although attention has been focused on the biological role of glucagon in the pancreatic islet physiology, much less is known about the identity and the role of the downstream signaling pathways linked to the Gcgr present in the pancreatic β cells. We first addressed the question of a possible positive coupling of endogenous β cell Gcgr, via cAMP-PKA pathway, to signaling components known to be linked to the tyrosine kinase receptor system. By using the MIN6 cell line and isolated rat pancreatic islets, we report that glucagon treatment of β cells caused a time-dependent activation of ERK1/2 at a low glucose concentration. We used pharmacological approaches to identify the signaling pathway leading from Gcgr activation to ERK1/2 activation. We observed that glucagon-induced MEK-ERK1/2 activities are mediated by the cAMP-PKA pathway but independently from p21Ras, PI 3-kinase, and extracellular calcium influx. An increase in intracellular [Ca2+] through mobilization of intracellular calcium pools was required for a maximal activation of ERK1/2 by PKA. In addition, Gcgr internalization process appears to participate in the ERK1/2 activation. Through nuclear translocation of ERK1/2, we found that glucagon induces phosphorylation of CREB, a major transcription factor allowing, by regulation of gene expression, the maintenance of the glucose-competent phenotype of the β cell, and the disruption of which in the β cell leads to type II diabetes (16Jhala U.S. Canettieri G.

Hoeffler J.P. Horm. Res. 1989; 32: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In a second part of our study, we evaluated whether or not miniglucagon, which we have shown to be co-released with glucagon from α cell (12Dalle S. Fontes G. Lajoix A.D. LeBrigand L. Gross R. Ribes G. Dufour M. Barry L. LeNguyen D. Bataille D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), exerts a counter-regulation on the signaling network engaged by Gcgr in the β cells. Most interesting, we found that miniglucagon, which blocks the insulinotropic effect of glucagon (9Dalle S. Smith P. Blache P. Le-Nguyen D. Le Brigand L. Bergeron F. Ashcroft F.M. Bataille D. J.

Measurement of cAMP Production—MIN6 cells were grown in 24-well plates and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal calf serum containing 1% BSA, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine as an inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, and the test substances. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, cells were extracted using 60% perchloric acid. Samples were neutralized with 9 n KOH and succinylated to increase the sensitivity of the assay, and cAMP was quantified by radioimmunoassay (9Dalle S. Smith P. Blache P. Le-Nguyen D. Le Brigand L.

Measurement of Ca2+ Influx—MIN6 cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in KRB containing 0.1% BSA and 1 mm glucose in a 5% CO2 environment. The preincubation solution was then replaced by KRB containing 8 μCi/ml 45CaCl2 (5-50 mCi/mg Ca+) and the test agents. The reaction, performed at 37 °C, was stopped by aspiration of the medium. Cells were then washed with ice-cold buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm LaCl2, 10 mm HEPES) and solubilized in KRB containing 0.1% Triton for 1 h at room temperature. An aliquot of the solution (100 μl) was then assayed for 45Ca2+ content in a β counter after addition of a liquid scintillation medium (Complete Phase Combining system, Amersham Biosciences).

MIN6 cells were then lysed in a cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mm pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, and 1 mg/ml bacitracin. After a 30-min incubation in lysis buffer, cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min to remove insoluble materials. Protein content was determined by Bradford assay. Cell lysates were denatured by boiling for 3 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Equal amounts of lysate proteins (25-35 μg of protein per lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatants (400-800 μg of total protein) were incubated with primary antibody as indicated for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated from the supernatant with protein A/G-Plus agarose, washed three times with ice-cold cell lysis buffer, and boiled for 3 min in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked, probed with the specific antibodies, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Visualization and quantification of the bands were obtained using a Kodak Image Station 2000 system (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunostaining for Phospho-p44/42 MAP Kinase—MIN6 cells were grown on glass coverslips for 3-5 days. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBST buffer) for 10 min. After incubation in blocking buffer (5% normal horse serum in TBST buffer) for 1 h at room temperature, coverslips were probed with the anti-phospho-ERK1/2 primary antibody in 5% BSA TBST buffer overnight at 4 °C (1:400 dilution). After washing, phospho-ERK1/2 antibody was detected by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) diluted 1:100 in 3% BSA TBST, for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted using a polyvinyl alcohol medium at least 1 h before observation using a Zeiss dual photon confocal microscope (Oberkocher, Germany). Subcellular Fractionation—After 2 h of starvation in KRB, 10-cm dishes plated MIN6 cells were stimulated with 10 nm glucagon for 5 min. Cells are washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES; 10 mm NaCl; 1 mm KH2PO4; 5 mm NaHCO3; 1 mm CaCl2; 0.5 mm MgCl2; 5 mm EDTA, pH 8; 1 mm PMSF; 10 μg/ml aprotinin; 10 μg/ml leupeptin; 1 μg/ml pepstatin). After 15 min of incubation, cells were disrupted (50 times) using a Dounce homogenizer (pestle B) at 4 °C and centrifuged for 5 min at 7500 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatant containing cytosol and membranes was collected and preserved for protein content determination and Western blot analysis, and the pellet containing nuclei was disrupted (30 times) using a Dounce homogenizer (pestle B) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin (TSE buffer) and centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm at 4 °C.

Because the cAMP/PKA pathway has been shown to activate the ERK1/2 signaling cascade in β cells (19Gomez E. Pritchard C. Herbert T.P. J. Biol.

In this glucose situation, glucagon has no effect on insulin secretion (9Dalle S. Smith P. Blache P. Le-Nguyen D. Le Brigand L. Bergeron F. Ashcroft F.M. Bataille D. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), in the presence of a non-insulinotropic glucose concentration (2.8 mm), MIN6 cells exhibited a small but significant transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 1A). The amounts of phosphorylated ERK2 (p42 MAP kinase) peaked at 5 min and returned to the basal level by 10-20 min (Fig. 1B). Addition of 10 nm glucagon significantly enhanced glucose-induced activation of ERK1/2 at all time points (Fig. 1, A and B). We also tested the hypothesis whether activated Gcgrs transduce ERK1/2 cascade in MIN6 cells in the absence of glucose. Most interesting, we observed that, even under these extra-physiological conditions, glucagon alone induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 with a maximal effect observed at 5 min which returned to basal by 30 min (Fig. 1, C and D). Mechanisms of Glucagon-induced ERK1/2 Activation—We used pharmacological approaches to identify the mechanisms of glucagon-induced ERK1/2 activation in the absence of glucose during the glucagon stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that, under non-physiological conditions in which there is no calcium influx, a mechanism linked to the cAMP/PKA pathway exists in the β cells, activating the ERK1/2 cascade independently from calcium entry. In line with the fact that glucagon alone had no significant effect on basal calcium uptake (Fig. 7A), we observed that glucagon-mediated ERK1/2 activation in the absence of glucose (10 min) (Fig. 2, A and B), or in the presence of 2.8 mm glucose (data not shown), was not significantly inhibited by the VDCC blocker nifedipine. The role of PKA in the ERK1/2 activation by glucagon was addressed in this context. The complete suppression of the glucagon-induced ERK1/2 activation by a non-cytotoxic treatment with a low concentration of PKA-specific inhibitor (H89) clearly indicated that the glucagon-stimul"

Here, recombinant collagen VIII was expressed to study its supramolecular assembly following secretion. Cells transfected with α1(VIII) or α2(VIII) assembled and secreted homotrimers that were stable in denaturing conditions and had a molecular mass of ∼180 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels. Co-transfection with prolyl 4-hydroxylase generated homotrimers with stable pepsin-resistant triple-helical domains. Size fractionation of native recombinant collagen VIII molecules expressed with or without prolyl 4-hydroxylase identified urea-sensitive high molecular mass assemblies eluting in the void volume of a Superose 6HR 10/30 column and urea-resistant assemblies of ∼700 kDa, all of which were composed of homotrimers. Immunofluorescence analysis highlighted the extracellular deposition of recombinant α1(VIII)3, α2(VIII)3, and co-expressed α1(VIII)3/α2(VIII)3. Microscopy analysis of recombinant collagen VIII identified rod-like molecules of 134 nm in length that assembled into angular arrays with branching angles of ∼114° and extensive networks. Based on these data, we propose a model of collagen VIII assembly in which four homotrimers form a tetrahedron stabilized by central interacting C-terminal NC1 trimers.

Tetrahedrons may then act as building blocks of three-dimensional hexagonal lattices generated by secondary interactions involving terminal and helical sequences. Collagen VIII was initially identified in the culture medium of endothelial cells and designated EC collagen (endothelial cell collagen) (1Benya P.D. Padilla S.R. J. Biol.

It is a non-fibrillar collagen with a short triple-helical domain that is flanked by non-collagenous C-terminal NC1 and N-terminal NC2 domains (3Sage H. Pritzl P. Bornstein P.

It is a prominent component of Descemet's membrane, the basement membrane separating corneal endothelial cells from corneal stroma (5Kapoor R. Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3930-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and of blood vessel walls where it occurs within the vascular subendothelium and in association with medial elastic fibers (6Sinha S.

Kielty C. Shuttleworth A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Some tissue extraction studies have suggested that collagen VIII exists in vivo as heterotrimers (2Yamaguchi N. Benya P.D. van de Rest M. Ninomiya Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16022-16029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kapoor R. Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3930-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In another study, data from biochemical, immunohistochemical, and molecular biological experiments showed that α1 and α2 chains of collagen VIII exist as homotrimers in cells and tissues (8Greenhill N.S. Ruger B.M. Hasan Q. Davis P.F. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Both α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) were present in equimolar concentrations in Descemet's membrane, immunoprecipitation of collagen VIII from Descemet's membrane extracts using chain-specific antibodies yielded fractions that contained either α1(VIII) or α2(VIII), transcription of both genes was not always coordinated, and both polypeptides were present in cornea, optic nerve, aorta, and umbilical cord but did not always co-localize. Collagen VIII is structurally closely related to collagen X (19Shuttleworth C.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Both collagens form unusually stable trimers through strong non-covalent interactions of their C-terminal NC1 domains (20Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot Handford R.P.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Modeling of the crystal structure of collagen X NC1 domain revealed a buried Ca2+ cluster that may contribute to trimer stability and an aromatic surface patch that may be involved in supramolecular assembly (25Bogin O. Kvansakul M. Rom E. Singer J. Yayon A. Hohenster E. Structure. 2002; 10: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This Ca2+ cluster involves Asp-626 and Asp-634 residues forming coordinated interactions with the Ca2+ ions. Three hydrophobic residues, Trp-611, Tyr-625, and Tyr-667, in collagen X NC1 domain comprise a hydrophobic external face on collagen X trimers that can bind the steroid moiety of the zwitterionic non-denaturing detergent CHAPS. 1The abbreviations used are: CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; EBNA, Epstein-Barr nucleating antigen; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SMC, smooth muscle cells; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. These residues may be responsible for supramolecular assemblies of collagen X by NC1 hydrophobic interactions (25Bogin O. Kvansakul M. Rom E. Singer J. Yayon A. Hohenster E. Structure. 2002; 10: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The resolution of the α1(VIII)3 NC1 trimer crystal structure has shown that, although lacking a buried Ca2+ cluster, the hydrophobic region interacts with CHAPS and may contribute to the organization of collagen VIII supramolecular assembly (26Kvansakul M. Bogin O. Honhenster E. Yayon A. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These hydrophobic residues are conserved in both α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) and may regulate assembly of collagen VIII by a similar mechanism. In this study, we have expressed recombinant α1(VIII)3 and α2(VIII)3 in mammalian cells and investigated their supramolecular assembly. Stable secreted triple-helical collagen VIII homotrimers were obtained after co-transfection with prolyl 4-hydroxylase that were deposited in the extracellular matrix. A novel intermediate of higher order extracellular assembly has been identified that suggests a tetrahedron model of collagen VIII lattice formation.

Gel filtration columns and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were purchase from Amersham Biosciences. Expression Constructs—Human full-length α1(VIII) was isolated from a λgt11 aorta cDNA library, subcloned into pBluescript(+), and designated pBlu-Hal8. It contained a 210-bp 5′-untranslated region, the entire coding sequence including the putative translation start and termination signals, and 24 bp of 3′-untranslated region. The α1(VIII) cDNA was isolated from pBlu-Ha18 by restriction digestion with NotI/XhoI and directly subcloned into pCEP4 for transfection into 293-EBNA cells. This clone was designated pCEP4α1(VIII). A 6-kb α2(VIII) murine genomic clone containing the entire coding sequence (kindly supplied by Dr B. R. Olsen, Boston, MA) was used as a template for overlap PCR. This clone contained exons 3 and 4, which contain the entire coding sequence of α2(VIII). The 6-kb clone was cloned into Bluescript(+) BamHI and NotI restriction sites. Exon 3 was generated by PCR using a 25-bp forward primer for exon 3 with an engineered EcoRI restriction site inserted three bases downstream from the ATG initiation site (A2E3F, 5′-CGAATTCGCCATGCAGGGGGCTCTG-3′) and a 41-bp reverse primer (A2E3R, 3′-CGTTTCCGGTCATGAACCTTTACGGAGATGGCGACGACGGC-5′). Exon 4 was generated by PCR using a 44-bp forward primer, A2E4F, containing an 18-bp sequence complementary to the 5′ end of the α2(VIII) human exon 4 coding region position 29-46 (A2E4F, 5′-CCGAGAGGGCAAAGGCCAGTACTTGGAAATGCCTCTACCGCTGC-3′], and a 25-bp reverse primer including the stop codon TTA (A2E4R, 3′-GGCTCCGAATTATGTGGGGCAGAGC-5′). The overhang primers (A2E4F and A2E3F) were engineered to terminate on a base preceding a thymine in the complementary strand to prevent addition of further adenine bases by Taq polymerase and subsequent disruption of the reading frame during the second round of PCR when products were used to self-prime. Products generated from these PCR reactions were isolated using agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, purified, and then used in a second PCR reaction to generate the full-length sequence. The products were self-primed for six PCR cycles and then A2E3F and A2E4R primers were added to amplify the fusion product. The fusion product was gel-purified and then subcloned into TA cloning vector pCR 2.1. Correct insertion into a clone designated pCR 2.1 MFa28 was confirmed by EcoRI digestion and sequencing. The α2(VIII) cDNA was isolated from pCR 2.1 MFa28 by restriction digestion with NotI and directly subcloned into pCEP4 for transfection into 293-EBNA cells. This clone was designated pCEP4α2(VIII). The full-length α subunit of prolyl 4 hydroxylase (αSU P4H) was inserted within a pBluescript(+) (supplied by Dr. Kari Kivirikko, Oulu, Finland) vector designated PA59. The αSU P4H cDNA was isolated from PA59 by restriction digestion with KpnI and BamHI and directly subcloned into pREP8 for transfection into 293-EBNA cells. This clone was designated pREP8αP4H. Recombinant Expression of Collagen VIII—293-EBNA cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate and pyroxidine and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 μg/m streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm l-ascorbate-2-phosphate. The EBNA cassette was maintained in the 293-EBNA cells using 500 μg/ml geneticin. Stable cell lines expressing α1(VIII) or α2(VIII), respectively, were obtained by transfecting these cells with pCEP4α1(VIII) and pCEP4α2(VIII) by Lipofectin transfection and then selecting with 500 μg/ml hygromycin B. Control cells were produced by transfecting the pCEP vector into 293-EBNA cells. Recombinant protein expression and secretion into the cell medium was confirmed by Western blotting. Confluent 293-EBNA expression cells were washed with PBS and then cultured for 48 h in defined T6 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 1 mm l-ascorbate-2-phosphate. Cell medium was then removed to collect secreted protein. Control cells lines and cells expressing α1(VIII) or α2(VIII) were designated pCEP4293E, α1(VIII)293E, and α2(VIII)293E, respectively. Cell lines co-expressing α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) were designated α1α2(VIII)293E. The clone pREP8αP4H was transfected into α1(VIII)293E and α2(VIII)293E cells using Lipofectin to increase hydroxylation of proline residues and thereby increase helical stability. Cell lines containing the P4H construct were designated α1(VIII)P4H293E and α2(VIII)P4H293E. The pREP8 vector was also transfected into α1(VIII)293E and α2(VIII)293E cell lines to produce controls lacking the P4H construct. These were designated α1(VIII)PREP8293E and α2(VIII)PREP8293E. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.11 g/liter sodium pyruvate, pyroxidine, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 μg/m streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm l-ascorbate-2-phosphate. Cells were then washed with PBS and then cultured in defined T6 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 1 mm l-ascorbate-2-phosphate. Cell medium was removed after 48 h to collect secreted protein. Smooth Muscle Cell Cultures—Primary umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (SMC) were isolated from umbilical vein tissue by collagenase digestion and then maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4500 mg/liter glucose supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 μg/m streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm l-ascorbate-2-phosphate. Only SMC below passage 6 were used. Collagen VIII expression and secretion into the cell medium was confirmed by Western blotting. SMC were then washed with PBS and cultured in defined T6 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 1 mm l-ascorbate-2-phosphate. Cell medium was removed after 48 h to collect secreted protein. Immunofluorescence—The cell lines α1(VIII)293E, α2(VIII)293E, α1(VIII)P4H293E, α2(VIII)P4H293E, and α1α2(VIII)293E were cultured on glass chamber slides. Untransfected 293-EBNA cells were grown as controls for the transfected cells, and SMC were grown to compare collagen VIII immunolabeling with the transfected 293-EBNA cell lines. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells per chamber and then grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4500 mg/liter glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 μg/m streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm l-ascorbate-2-phosphate until confluent. Cells were washed in PBS and then fixed in 95% (v/v) methanol for 10 min before further washing in PBS. Cells were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and then incubated with primary antibody against collagen VIII, either monoclonal antibody at 1:200 (v/v) (10MacBeath J.R.E.

Cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit FITC antibodies (1:200 (v/v)), respectively. Antibodies were prefiltered prior to use through a 0.22 μm membrane to remove any aggregated material. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and covered with DAPI mounting fluid. Coverslips were placed over the cells, which were then sealed with nail varnish and stored at 4 °C in darkness. Cells were visualized with a Leica immunofluorescence microscope. Images of DAPI-stained cell nuclei and FITC-stained collagen VIII were overlaid using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Isolation and SDS-PAGE Analysis of Recombinant Collagen VIII—Transfected 293-EBNA cell culture medium was concentrated and then denatured by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue). Samples were run at 150 V on 4-12% Bis-Tris gels. In some experiments, 0.05 m dithiothreitol was added. Samples resolved on SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Transfer of proteins to the membranes was confirmed by visualization of pre-stained protein standards. Invitrogen SeeBlue Plus-2 markers (L C5925; Invitrogen) were run on all SDS-PAGE gels in this study. Previous reports of collagen VIII and X trimers on SDS-PAGE indicate varying molecular mass on SDS-PAGE (within a 180 to 220-kDa range) (17Illidge C. Kielty C. Shuttleworth A. J. Biol.

A comparison of commercial prestained markers on 4-12% Bis-Tris gels revealed that the high molecular mass Invitrogen marker (188 kDa) migrated slower than both the Bio-Rad Kaleidoscope 201-kDa marker and the Bio-Rad broad range standard 250-kDa marker. Thus, apparent discrepancies in trimer mass may reflect the use of different markers and SDS-PAGE gel systems. Nitrocellulose membranes were washed with TBST (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.5% polyoxyethylene-sorbitan monolaurate) and then blocked using 5% Marvel (w/v) TBST overnight at 4 °C. Subsequent wash or antibody incubation steps were supplemented with 2% (w/v) Marvel to maintain blocking of any nonspecific antibody binding sites. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in Marvel-TBST overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with TBST, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times in TBST before addition of enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and exposure to Bio-Rad MR film. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Transfected cell medium from the pCEP4 collagen VIII transfections was concentrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 and chromatographed on gel filtration columns (Sephacryl 200 16/60 and Superose 6 10/30) using AKTA Prime and AKTA Explorer systems (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions obtained following size fractionation of medium samples on a Superose 6 10/30 column were analyzed by immuno-slot blots (probed as outlined above for Western blotting), which provided a means of monitoring the molecular mass of recombinant collagen VIII preparations in native conditions. Samples were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Elution positions of native collagen VIII assemblies were compared with three other non-globular extracellular matrix molecular mass standards of laminin (900 kDa), fibronectin (500 kDa), and thrombospondin (450 kDa), as well as IgG (167 kDa). Recombinant collagen VIII expressed with or without co-transfection with prolyl 4-hydroxylase, dialyzed into column buffer containing 2 m urea, was also chromatographed on the Superose 6 10/30 column pre-equilibrated in 2 m urea to determine whether the high molecular mass assemblies were dissociated in these conditions. Pepsin Digestions—Medium containing collagen VIII was digested for 2 h with 100 μg/ml pepsin in 0.05 m acetic acid at temperatures of 4 and 37 °C. Samples were then resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-collagen VIII antibody that recognizes epitopes within α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) collagenous regions. Medium containing collagen VIII were also treated with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin after incubation at a range of temperatures from 30 to 90 °C, as described previously (17Illidge C. Kielty C. Shuttleworth A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22091-22095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Atomic Force Microscopy—Metal support stubs (15-mm diameter) were obtained from Veeco Instruments Inc. (Santa Barbara, CA), and muscovite mica sheets were obtained from Agar Scientific (Stansted, Essex, UK). Trimmed mica sheets were adhered to the sample stubs using clear nail varnish. Cleaved mica surfaces were prepared by peeling off the top layer of mica with adhesive tape immediately prior to sample deposition. Aliquots of collagen VIII from Superose 6 10/30 column fractions were diluted 1:2 with distilled H2O and incubated on the mica surface for 1 min. Excess liquid was removed by capillary action, and the surface was washed three times with 300 μl of distilled H2O. Prepared samples were allowed to air dry for at least 2 h prior to microscopical analysis. All samples were imaged by intermittent tapping mode in air using a Multimode atomic force microscope with a Nanoscope IIIa controller and an E scanner. Olympus high aspect ratio etched silicon probes with a spring constant of 42 n/m were obtained from Veeco Instruments Inc. (Santa Barbara, CA). Cantilever oscillation varied between 200 and 300 kHz, the drive amplitude was determined by the Nanoscope software, and images were captured at a scan rate of 1.2 Hz. The setpoint was adjusted to just below the point at which tip-sample interaction was lost. All measurements were conducted on height data, which was flattened using the Nanoscope software and exported to routines written in Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 for averaging. Gaussian curve fitting to α2(VIII) angle and distance data was performed in SigmaPlot 8.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Rotary Shadowing Electron Microscopy—Recombinant collagen VIII from Superose 6 10/30 column runs (void volume, 700-kDa fractions) were diluted with distilled H2O and then adsorbed onto mica and shadowed with tungsten/platinum, using a modification of the mica sandwich technique, as described previously (29Sherratt M.J. Graham H.K. Kielty C.M. Holmes D.F. Streuli C. Grant M.E. Methods in Molecular Biology. 39. Humana Press Inc., Totawa, NJ2000: 119-132Google Scholar). Samples were visualized using a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope. Expression of Recombinant Collagen VIII—cDNA fragments encoding α1(VIII) and α2(VIII) were inserted into pCEP4 episomal vectors and then transfected into 293-EBNA cells for recombinant collagen VIII expression (Fig. 1). In this system, 293-EBNA cells maintain cell plasmid population and efficient episomal expression. 293-EBNA cells transfected with pCEP4 alone were generated as an empty vector control. Primary SMC were isolated and cultured for production of endogenous collagen VIII. Collagen VIII secreted into transfected 293-EBNA or SMC culture medium was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in reducing and non-reducing conditions and Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-collagen VIII antibody (Fig. 1A). Immunoreactive bands at 180 kDa were detected that corresponded to α1(VIII)3 and α2(VIII)3 homotrimers and to SMC collagen VIII trimers. Collagen VIII was not detected in the empty vector control cells (not shown), and 293-EBNA cells did not produce detectable endogenous collagen VIII. No collagen VIII α-chains (∼60 kDa) were detected. More recombinant α2(VIII) was consistently produced than α1(VIII). The pREP8αP4H expression construct, which contains the full-length sequence of the α-subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, was transfected into 293-EBNA cells already stably transfected with α1(VIII) or α2(VIII) to ensure efficient prolyl hydroxylation and stable triple-helix formation. The empty vector pREP8 was transfected into α1(VIII)- and α2(VIII)-expressing cell lines as a control. Recombinant α1(VIII)3, α2(VIII)3, and α1(VIII)3/α2(VIII)3 expressed in these co-transfected cells also migrated as 180-kDa homotrimers on SDS-PAGE gels under reducing and non-reducing (Fig. 1B). Recombinant secreted collagen VIII, with and without co-expression with prolyl 4-hydroxylase, was subjected to pepsin digestion (100 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 or 37 °C and then compared for helical stability with SMC collagen VIII (Fig. 2, A and B). Pepsin-resistant fragments corresponding to those observed in SMC preparations were detected following digestion of recombinant α1(VIII)3 and α2(VIII) 3 that had been expressed by the co-transfected cells. Thus, co-expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase with recombinant collagen VIII had ensured the formation of stable triple-helical collagen VIII molecules. However, digestion experiments using chymotrypsin and trypsin digestion, after incubation at a range of temperatures from 30 to >90 °C, showed no differences in banding patterns (not shown). In all subsequent experiments, recombinant collagen VIII was co-expressed with prolyl 4-hydroxylase to ensure that stable helical collagen VIII assemblies were analyzed. Size Exclusion Chromatography of Native Collagen VIII Assemblies—Size exclusion chromatography of recombinant collagen VIII (α1(VIII)3, α2(VIII)3, and α1/α2(VIII)3) in native conditions was conducted to determine whether collagen VIII formed higher order assemblies in vitro, as shown previously for collagen X (24Kwan A.P.L. Cummings C.E. Chapman J.A. Grant M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Recombinant collagen VIII and SMC collagen VIII were eluted over a Sephacryl 200 16/60 column with a volume of 120 ml, exclusion limit of 2.5 × 105 kDa, and a void"

Here we show that the carboxyl EWV motif of MT5-MMP serves as a retrieval signal for internalized MT5-MMP by interacting with Mint-3, a protein with two type III PDZ domains. Deletion of the EWV signal impairs the recycling of MT5-MMP without affecting its internalization, leading to decreased activity on the cell surface. A yeast two-hybrid screening identified Mint-3 as the EWV-binding protein. Mint-3 stimulates MT5-MMP activity when expressed at low levels in an EWV-dependent fashion, but inhibits its activity at higher levels independent of the EWV motif. siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Mint-3 decreased MT5-MMP activity. Furthermore, Mint-3 significantly increased the level of MT5-MMP on the cell surface without affecting its synthesis and internalization. Therefore, Mints may be the adaptor proteins that regulate the trafficking of MT-MMPs.

Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2630) Google Scholar). The MMP family is composed of at least 21 MMPs that fall into two major groups according to their cellular localization: secreted MMPs and membrane-anchored MMPs (also known as membrane-type MMPs, MT-MMPs) (5Lopez-Otin C. Overall C.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 6Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). While virtually all members of the MMP family have been implicated in the progression of cancer, the MT-MMPs have been demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo, to play a more critical role than their soluble counterparts (2Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that MT-MMPs can overcome the inhibitory effects exerted by the type I collagen matrix to allow cells to grow and proliferate in a three-dimensional model (7Kang T. Yi J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In particular, MT1-MMP has been shown to possess the greatest activity to usurp the inhibitory effect of type 1 collagen in a three-dimensional model when expressed in various cells including tumor cells (2Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Through domain-swapping experiments, we have recently shown that both the catalytic and hemopexin domains of MT1-MMP are required for MT1-MMP to express optimal activity against type I collagen and promote cell growth in a three-dimensional model (8Jiang A. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38765-38771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have identified the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP as a strong negative regulator of its activity against both type I collagen and pro-MMP-2 in cell-based assays (8Jiang A. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38765-38771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting that the proteolytic activity on the cell surface of MT1-MMP may be regulated through the interaction of its cytoplasmic tail with cellular trafficking machinery.As important cell surface molecules, a critical question concerning the mechanisms by which MT-MMPs are regulated is how the cells deliver them to specialized areas through trafficking events. Recently, we and others (9Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10Uekita T.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3905-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have shown that MT1-MMP is internalized by a dynamin-dependent process. Deletion or mutation of the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP significantly impairs its internalization. Moreover, our recent study has shown that internalized MT1-MMP could be recycled back to the cell surface through the trans-Golgi network (12Wang X. Ma D. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 9331-9336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although the carboxyl-terminal three residues have been identified as the recycling signal (12Wang X. Ma D. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 279: 9331-9336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), little is known about the cellular machinery that controls the dynamic trafficking of MT-MMPs.The cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP has been shown to interact with the adaptor protein AP2 through its μ2 subunits (10Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The LLY motif was identified as the μ2 binding site (10Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Recently, a protein named gC1qR was demonstrated as a binding protein for the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP (13Rozanov D.V. Ghebrehiwet B. Ratnikov B. Monosov E.Z. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, there have been no reports demonstrating the functional significance of the observed interactions, i.e. increasing or decreasing the proteolytic activity of MT-MMPs on the cell surface. It remains unclear if other cellular factors can regulate the function of MT-MMPs via interaction with their cytoplasmic tails. Likewise, the mechanism by which the cytoplasmic domains regulate MT-MMP activity remains to be discovered.MT5-MMP, the last member of the type I MT-MMP subfamily, is expressed predominantly in the brain and at low levels in the kidney, pancreas, and lung (14Llano E. Pendas A.M. Freije J.P. Nakano A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression of MT5-MMP can be detected in various cancer cells and tissue, suggesting that MT5-MMP may play a role in the progression of cancer (14Llano E. Pendas A.M. Freije J.P. Nakano A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar). MT5-MMP has been shown to play a role in axonal growth (15Hayashita-Kinoh H. Kinoh H. Okada A. Komori K. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Kajita M. Yana I. Seiki M. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 573-580PubMed Google Scholar). However, the best established function for MT5-MMP is its ability to activate pro-MMP2, a secreted proteinase implicated widely in physiological and pathological conditions such as tumor invasion and metastasis (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). While sharing similar domain structure with other MT-MMPs, the cytoplasmic tail of MT5-MMP is the most divergent, having only 50% identity with those of MT1-MMP, MT2-MMP, and MT3-MMP (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Indeed, Uekita et al. (10Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) concluded that MT5-MMP is not internalized, given the fact that it lacks the conserved LLY motif shown to interact with the μ2 subunit of AP2. In this report, we analyzed the trafficking of MT5-MMP and present evidence that it is internalized, albeit slower than MT1-MMP. More interestingly, we present evidence that the internalized MT5-MMP recycles back to the cell surface in a process dependent on its last three residues EWV. Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified Mint-3 as the EWV-binding protein. With two type III PDZ domains, Mint-3 is localized to the TGN with MT5-MMP, where it mediates the recycling of MT5-MMP to the cell surface. This represents the first report that a PDZ protein regulates the trafficking of MT-MMPs.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—All general chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Rabbit anti-MT5-MMP antibodies were raised against the purified catalytic domain of mouse MT5-MMP and affinity-purified as described previously (17Kang T. Yi J. Guo A. Wang X. Overall C. Jiang W. Elde R. Borregaard N. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21960-21968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Anti-Mint-3 and anti-p230 antibodies were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Goat anti-rabbit or mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Alexa 488- and 595-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). BB94 was a gift from British Biotechnology (Oxford, UK).Yeast Two-hybrid System—The MATCHMAKER GAL4 two-hybrid System3 and the human leukocyte cDNA library were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The bait for library screening was the cytoplasmic tail of mouse MT5-MMP. Two-hybrid screening was done according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer.Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, N2A cells and MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. All cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method as described previously (6Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For all transfection experiments, pcDNA3 or PCR3.1 vector was used to equalize total DNA input to the same level.Plasmids—Full-length mouse MT5-MMP was cloned into expression vector PCR3.1uni as described (16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The deletion and point mutation of MT5-MMP were generated by PCR using this plasmid as template. Rat Mint-3 (NM_031781), human Mint-3 (NM_004886), and Mint-2 (NM_005503) were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector in-frame with HA at the amino terminus. Mint-3 deletion mutants were subcloned by PCR from rat Mint-3 into pcDNA3.1 with the HA tag at the amino terminus. The CMV-GST fusion proteins were subcloned from pGEX4T-1 to pcDNA3 by PCR. The vector-based small hairpin inhibitory RNA (siRNA) of Mint-3 was cloned into PBS-U6. The targeted sequence was in the middle of the open reading frame for human Mint-3 (5′-AGGTACCTGGGGTCCA-3′). Expression constructs for dynamin and dynamin K44A were generously provided by Dr. Lefkowitz (Duke University, Durham, NC) and characterized as described (9Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30219-30226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation—48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 150m M NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated at 4 °C with anti-HA (1 μg) antibody or anti MT5-MMP antibody for 2 h. Immune complexes were immobilized on protein-A beads for 3 h, washed three times with lysis buffer, and water-bathed in SDS sample buffer in 50 °C for 20 min. Prepared samples were subjected to Western blotting analysis.GST Pull-down Assay—HEK293 cells were co-transfected with Mint-3 using HA-tagged GST, GST-V614G, or GST-CT. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer, and cell extracts were cleared and incubated with GST beads at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The prepared samples were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody.Zymography and Western Blotting—Zymography was performed as previously described (7Kang T. Yi J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in 6- or 12-well plates. After transfection, cells were washed three times with PBS, and the medium was changed to 5% fetal bovine medium (the source of pro-MMP2) (0.5 ml per well for a 12-well plate or 1 ml for a 6-well plate). After 24 h of incubation, the medium was harvested and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and subjected to analyze by SDS-PAGE impregnated with 1 mg/ml gelatin as described (6Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The gels were incubated at 37 °C overnight, stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, and images were captured by scanning. The active species of MMP2 were quantified by densitometry using an Eagle-Eye system (Stratagene). For Western blotting, cells were lysed in lysis buffer, cleared by centrifugation, and analyzed using specific antibody.Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with indicated plasmids. 24 h later, cells were fixed with 4% polyformaldehyde for 20 min and incubated with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. HA-tagged fusion protein was detected with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and MT5-MMP was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Coverslips were analyzed on a confocal microscope in the Biomedical Image Processing Laboratories (BIPL) at the University of Minnesota as described (9Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). For internalization experiments, cells on coverslips were washed three times with PBS and kept at 4 °C. Anti-MT5-MMP antibodies were added to the cells at 0.2 μg/ml for 2 h at 4 °C. Antibodies were subsequently removed, and cells were washed before being heated to 37 °C with prewarmed medium for the indicated time. Cells were then processed as described previously (9Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The coverslips were mounted with NO-FADE (10% glycerol in PBS, 0.1% p-phenylenediamine, pH 8.0). Confocal images were collected from a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 system attached to an Olympus microscope (Melville, NY) with a ×60-oil objective at the BIPL, University of Minnesota. Quantification was performed with Openlab (Improvision, Coventry, UK). The statistical analysis was carried out with GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA).Cell Surface Labeling with Biotin—Briefly, cells were grown in 6-well plates and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. Then the cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. After extensive washing with ice-cold PBS containing 50 mm glycine, the cells were lysed and incubated with strepavidin-conjugated beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting as previously described (9Jiang A. Lehti K. Wang X. Weiss S.J. Keski-Oja J. Pei D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13693-13698Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).Growth of MCF-7 Cells in the Three-dimensional Collagen Gel—MCF-7 stable transfectants (1 × 103) were mixed with 300 μl of type I collagen (2 mg/ml, Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) and allowed to gel at 37 °C in 24-well plates to give rise to a three-dimensional collagen matrix. Fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with or without 5 μm BB94 were added to the wells and changed every 2 days. After 12 days, cells were photographed by a video camera at the University of Minnesota BIPL as described (7Kang T. Yi J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).RESULTSMT5-MMP Recycles through the trans-Golgi Network—Recently, we have shown that MT1-MMP is internalized constantly through dynamin-regulated endocytosis such that most of the MT1-MMP resides intracellularly in the trans-Golgi network, and little MT1-MMP activity is detected on the cell surface as measured by pro-MMP-2 activation (9Jiang A.

Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) identified a di-leucine motif as the signal for MT1-MMP internalization. Interestingly, while MT2-MMP and MT3-MMP have similar di-leucine motifs at their cytoplasmic tails, MT5-MMP lacks such a di-leucine motif and was reported to be defective in internalization as well (10Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We re-evaluated the internalization of MT-MMPs and discovered that MT5-MMP was internalized efficiently, albeit slower than MT1-MMP (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, MT5-MMP labeled with anti-MT5-MMP antibodies commenced internalization around 30 min (panel c) at permissive temperature and reappears on the cell surface between 70 and 90 min (panels e and f), compared with 60 min observed for MT1-MMP (data not shown). To track the intracellular compartments that MT5-MMP is routed through, we co-stained the internalized MT5-MMP with various markers at different time points. As shown in Fig. 1B, internalized MT5-MMP was co-localized with RUFY1, an early endosomal marker, suggesting that MT5-MMP is delivered to the early endosomes after internalization. Furthermore, the internalized MT5-MMP was also routed to the TGN evidenced by their co-localization with p230, a well-known marker for the TGN (Fig. 1C). Together, these data demonstrate for the first time that MT5-MMP is not only internalized, but also recycled back to the cell surface via the trans-Golgi network.MT5-MMPΔ3 Is Defective in Recycling—To evaluate the signals responsible for the internalization and recycling of MT5-MMP, we performed systematic deletion experiments on the cytoplasmic tail of MT5-MMP. Among the mutants analyzed, a deletion mutant lacking the last three residues, EWV, is shown in Fig. 2A. While wild-type MT5-MMP was internalized and recycled as shown in Fig. 1A, MT5Δ3 was internalized rapidly, appearing 10 min at the permissible temperature and remained intracellular even at prolonged periods of time (Fig. 2B, panels a-f), suggesting that it does not recycle back to the cell surface. Indeed, careful quantification of the cell surface MT5-MMP demonstrates that MT5Δ3 is indeed defective in recycling (Fig. 2C).Fig. 2Recycling of MT5-MMP mediated by carboxyl-terminal EWV motif.

S, signal peptide; Pro, prodomain; R, RXKR furin recognition motif; CAT, catalytic domain; H, hinge; Pexin, hemopexin-like domain; T, transmembrane domain; C, cytosolic domain. B, MT5Δ3 is defective in recycling. MDCK cells transfected with MT5Δ3 were labeled with anti-MT5 antibody at 4 °C and allowed to internalize for indicated periods of time at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Representative cell images for every slide were collected by confocal microscope. C, quantification for internalization assay. Five typical cells for each time point in the internalization assay in B were recorded with three layers each. The total fluorescent intensity and the surface signal intensity for every recorded cell were measured in Openlab. The statistical analysis was done with GraphPad software.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Recycling-defective MT5-MMPΔ3 Has Diminished Activity on the Cell Surface—The lack of recycling of MT5-MMPΔ3 should diminish the level of MT5-MMP on the cell surface. To test this possibility, we performed dose response experiments by transfecting increasing amounts of both wild-type and mutant MT5-MMP into HEK293 cells, and the resulting MT5-MMP proteins (and their cell surface activity against pro-MMP-2) were analyzed by Western blotting and zymography. As shown in Fig. 3B, while both wild-type and MT5Δ3 were expressed at similar levels as expected (upper panel), the deletion mutant exhibited significant reduction in its ability to activate pro-MMP-2 (lower panel, lanes 1-6 versus 7-12).Fig. 3Deletion of the putative PDZ binding motif decreased MT5-MMP-mediated pro-MMP2 activation on the cell surface.

B, activation of pro-MMP2 by MT5 or MT5Δ3. HEK293 transfected with different amounts of MT5 or MT5Δ3 were grown in 12-well plates and treated with 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum per well overnight. 5 μl of conditioned medium were analyzed by gelatin zymography (1 mg/ml gelatin in 8.5% PAGE, incubated at 37 °C overnight). For Western blotting analysis, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The expression was analyzed using anti-MT5 antibody. C, activation of pro-MMP2 by MT5 and MT5V614G in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with different amounts of MT5 or MT5Δ3. Their activity and expression were analyzed as described in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further refine the requirement for the EWV motif, a point mutation V614G of MT5-MMP was generated. In a similar dose-dependent pro-MMP-2 activation assay, this point mutant behaved similar to MT5-MMPΔ3 (Fig. 3C, lower panel, lanes 1-6 versus 7-12), suggesting that Val614 is a critical residue of the EWV motif. Since MT-MMPs have been shown to enhance the growth of tumor cells in type I collagen lattice (2Hotary K.B. Allen E.D. Brooks P.C. Datta N.S. Long M.W. Weiss S.J. Cell. 2003; 114: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 7Kang T. Yi J. Yang W. Wang X. Jiang A. Pei D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we have generated stable cell lines that express wild-type and MT5Δ3 in MCF-7 cells, and their ability to grow in three-dimensional type I collagen gel was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 4, while MCF7 cells harboring wild-type MT5-MMP grew into significantly larger cysts than MCF7 cells with only the expression vector (B versus A), the cells with MT5Δ3 grew less robustly than those with wild-type MT5-MMP (C versus B). As expected, the MMP inhibitor BB-94 inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells grown in type I collagen three-dimensional gels (Fig. 4, panels E-G versus A-C). Thus, these data suggest that the EWV motif behaves as a positive signal for MT5-MMP-mediated pro-MMP2 activation and growth in the type I collagen gel.Fig. 4Deletion of EWV decreased MT5-MMP-mediated MCF-7 cells growth in type I collagen three-dimensional gels. MCF7 cells stably transfected with empty vector (A and E), MT5 (B and F), or MT5Δ3 (C and G) were grown in type I collagen three-dimensional gels (2 mg/ml) treated with (A-C) or without (E-G) BB94 for 12 days. The cells in the three-dimensional gels were photographed, and representative images are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of Mint-3 as a Binding Partner for MT5-MMP—Our data strongly suggest that the terminal motif, EWV, plays a key role in mediating MT5-MMP trafficking. We hypothesized that this motif binds to proteins in the trafficking pathway through its carboxyl-terminal valine to regulate the surface expression and activity of MT5-MMP. To identify those proteins that directly bind to MT5-MMP, we used the cytoplasmic tail of MT5-MMP fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human leukocyte complementary DNA library, which we have demonstrated to be an efficient library. About thirty positive clones were obtained in the screening from ∼1 million transformants. Sequencing revealed that one positive clone encoded fusion proteins of the GAL4 activation domain with a portion of Mint-3 (residues 421-575). Mint-3 belongs to the Mint protein family with three members (Mint 1-3, also known as X11 α, β, γ) that all contain a conserved PTB domain and two carboxyl-terminal PDZ domains (19Okamoto M. Sudhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has been reported that Mints can bind to some membrane proteins, and overexpression of the Mints protein leads to an increase of βAPP production in cells (20Okamoto M. Nakajima Y. Matsuyama T. Sugita M. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The insert we obtained encoded a part of PDZa and the entire PDZb domains of Mint-3, suggesting that the PDZ domains may bind to the EWV motif in MT5-MMP.To confirm the interaction between MT5-MMP and Mint-3 in intact cells, we co-expressed an HA-tagged version of Mint-3 with MT5-MMP in HEK293 cells. The HA-Mint-3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that MT5-MMP co-precipitates with Mint-3 (Fig. 5A). To our surprise, three MT5-MMP species were detected in Mint-3 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5A) and all appear to be insensitive to both Endo H and PNGase F, which can remove the N-linked sugars (data not shown). Reciprocal assays also demonstrated that Mint-3 was present in the MT5-MMP immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5B). Moreover, another member of the Mint protein family, Mint-2, could also bind to MT5-MMP in transfected cells efficiently (data not shown).Fig. 5Interaction between MT5-MP and Mint-3. A, MT5-MMP co-immunoprecipitated (IP) with HA-tagged Mint-3 (HA-Mint-3). MT5 was co-expressed with control vector or HA-Mint-3 in HEK293 cells. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (IB) to detect the co-immunoprecipitated MT5 with the anti-MT5 antibody (top panel). Immunoprecipitated Mint-3 was detected with anti-HA antibody. The amount of MT5-MMP in the whole cell lysates was examined using immunoblot analysis (bottom panel). B, MT5 co-IP Mint-3. HA-Mint-3 was co-expressed with control vector or MT5 in HEK293 cells. Immunoprecipitated MT5 was examined with anti-MT5 antibody and co-immunoprecipitated Mint-3 was examined with antibody to HA. C, mapping the interacting domains of MT5 in Mint-3. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with MT5 and full-length or truncated HA-Mint-3. Full-length and truncated Mint-3 were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and the presence of MT5-MMP in the IP was detected using anti-MT5-MMP"
https://openalex.org/W2088977611,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is the mRNA cap-binding protein required for translation of cellular mRNAs utilizing the 5′ cap structure. The rate-limiting factor for mRNA recruitment to ribosomes, eIF4E is a major target for regulation of translation by growth factors, hormones, and other extracellular stimuli. When overexpressed, eIF4E exerts profound effects on cell growth and survival, leading to suppression of oncogene-dependent apoptosis, causing malignant transformation and conferring tumors with multiple drug resistance. We found previously that overexpressed eIF4E interdicts the apoptotic pathway induced by growth factor withdrawal and cytotoxic drugs by selectively activating the expression of Bcl-XL, thus preventing mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. In this study, we examined the impact of ectopic eIF4E expression on apoptosis mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here we show that eIF4E rescued cells from the ER stressors brefeldin A, tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. In addition, we found that cells rescued from Ca2+ ionophore-triggered apoptosis did not release calcium from their ER nor did they translocate caspase-12 from the ER to the cytoplasm. These data lend strong support to the concept that eIF4E functions as a pleiotropic regulator of cell viability and that integration of critical organelle-mediated checkpoints for apoptosis can be controlled by the cap-dependent translation apparatus.

Intracellular membrane-bound organelles are the principal loci where processes regulating the functions of caspases reside (1Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, the mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; eIF4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; AMC, amino-methylcoumarin; AFC, amino-trifluoromethyl coumarin. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; eIF4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; AMC, amino-methylcoumarin; AFC, amino-trifluoromethyl coumarin. are the best documented integrators of intrinsic and extracellular signals leading to cell death. The function of these organelles in apoptosis is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which controls critical decision nodes in the apoptotic cascade and shares homology in up to four conserved regions termed BH domains (2Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar, 3Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S. Cell. 2003; 112: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The “multidomain” anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak have three or four BH domains and reside in the cytosol, perinuclear membrane, outer membrane of mitochondria, and membranes of the ER (4Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar, 5Zong W.X. Li C. Hatzivassiliou G. Lindsten T. Yu Q.C. Yuan J. Thompson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The intramembrane balance between these opposing Bcl-2 family members controls an essential gateway for apoptotic signals (2Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic “BH-3-only” members of the family, such as BID, BIM, and BAD, have sequence homology within the α-helical BH3 region and function upstream of membrane organelles. They select and connect proximal death signals to Bax and Bak by targeting cytosolic apoptotic agonists to membranes with subsequent activation by homooligomerization (6Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). When activated, Bax and Bak change organelle membrane permeability for a set of critical metabolites, which efflux from membrane-bound compartments, resulting in dramatic perturbations of intracellular homeostasis, activation of effector caspases, and cell death. Pro-apoptotic signals activate Bax- and Bak-driven membrane alterations in both mitochondria and the ER (4Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), providing a means to integrate and coordinate the role of these compartments in controlling intrinsic apoptosis. Despite sharing these upstream signaling pathways and downstream effector molecules, apoptotic checkpoints controlled by the mitochondrion and ER require distinct categories of death stimuli and utilize upstream regulators and downstream effectors that are unique to each organelle (4Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). In this regard, altered permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane results from signals mediated by BH3-only proteins. This leads to an efflux of transmembrane proteins including cytochrome c, which associates with dATP, Apaf-1, and procaspase-9 to form the apoptosome, which in turn activates downstream effector caspases (7Saleh A.

Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) but is highly responsive to signals that induce ER stress and ER membrane protein misfolding, such as lipid messengers (11Li C. Fox C.J. Master S.R. Bindokas V.P. Chodosh L.A. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9830-9835Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or oxidative stimuli (12Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7233) Google Scholar). Bax- and Bak-induced alterations in ER membrane permeability result in Ca2+ release from the ER lumen with subsequent activation of caspase-12 (13Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). Localized in the ER, caspase-12 is activated by ER stressors targeting the transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi body (e.g. brefeldin A), inhibiting their N-glycosylation (e.g. tunicamycin), disrupting ER calcium homeostasis (e.g. thapsigargin), or augmenting cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (e.g. calcium ionophore A23187) (14Mehmet H. Nature. 2000; 403: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Accumulation of unfolded protein intermediates in the ER activates an integrated set of stress signals designated the unfolded protein response (15Liu C.Y. Kaufman R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1861-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 827-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Caspase-12-deficient cells are resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis (13Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar), and ER stressors can activate caspase-12, -9, and -3 independently of cytochrome c and Apaf-1 (17Morishima N. Nakanishi K.

Thus, available data suggest that caspase-12 is a specific mediator of ER stressor-triggered apoptosis (13Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J.

Despite evidence documenting their unique and distinctive features, the mitochondrial and ER apoptosis checkpoints frequently function in an interconnected and integrated manner. For example, administration of exogenous ER stressors or interventions that target ectopic Bax to the ER result in the release of Ca2+ from the ER, with a subsequent increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and the enhanced efflux of cytochrome c (4Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar, 19Nutt L.K. Pataer A. Pahler J. Fang B. Roth J. McConkey D.J. Swisher S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9219-9225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A variety of apoptotic triggers including genotoxic agents and growth factor withdrawal can activate the Bax/Bad-mediated checkpoints in both mitochondria and the ER (4Scorrano L. Oakes S.A. Opferman J.T. Cheng E.H. Sorcinelli M.D. Pozzan T. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). This coupling of ER stress to the mitochondrial death pathway strongly implies the existence of a mechanism to coordinate control of the apoptotic functions in these organelles with proapoptotic signals from the extracellular environment. However, the mechanisms by which extracellular events modulate the organelle-specific set points of susceptibility to apoptosis are incompletely understood. In this report, we sought to identify an apical regulator capable of coordinating the responses of mitochondria and the ER to pro- and anti-apoptotic forces in the extracellular milieu. We found previously (36Li S. Takasu T. Perlman D.M. Peterson M.S. Burrichter D. Avdulov S. Bitterman P.B. Polunovsky V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3015-3022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that the set point for cellular susceptibility to apoptosis through the mitochondrial checkpoint is governed by pre-translational and translational control of Bcl-XL mediated by the cap-dependent translation initiation apparatus. A trimolecular complex designated eIF4F, the initiation apparatus is required for recruitment of capped mRNAs to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. It comprises the mRNA cap-binding protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), eIF4A (an ATP-dependent RNA helicase), and eIF4G (a docking protein) (20Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Here we show that activation of the cap-dependent translational apparatus also rescued cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis in this case by mediating the blockade of calcium release from the ER to the cytosol and by preventing activation of caspase-12. These findings indicate that the integration of critical organelle-mediated checkpoints for apoptosis can be controlled by the cap-dependent translation apparatus. Cell Lines—Parental NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and cells constitutively expressing eIF4E (3T3/4E) have been described previously (21Polunovsky V.A. Rosenwald I.B. Tan A.T. White J. Chiang L. Sonenberg N. Bitterman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6573-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Both NIH 3T3 and 3T3/4E cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 5.9 g/liter HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin. Analysis of Apoptosis—To trigger apoptosis, cells were treated with the ER stressors thapsigargin, brefeldin A, tunicamycin, and calcium ionophore A23187 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. Pilot dose-response studies were carried out to determine the optimal concentration of each agent in our cell system. After treatment with the designated ER stressor, both detached and adherent cells were collected for analysis. The cells were fixed with 70% ethanol, washed with PBS, and stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, 32 μg/ml EDTA, 2.5 μg/ml RNase in PBS) for 45 min at 37 °C. DNA content was determined by quantitative flow cytometry using the CellQuest program. Measurement of Calcium Permeability Changes in Response to A23187—Cells were seeded on glass coverslips coated with fetal calf serum and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 4 μm of fura-2-AM. The cells were washed with fura-out buffer (139 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 10 μm glycine, and 15 μm sucrose), excited, and monitored. After adding 5 μm A23187 in fura-out buffer, fluorescence was measured at 340- and 380-nm wavelengths every 5 min for 1 h. Caspase Assays—Cells were treated with 5 μm A23187 for the indicated time intervals, both detached and adherent cells were collected, washed with PBS, and disrupted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate) supplemented with proteinase/phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerolphosphate) by three cycles of freeze and thaw (15 min at -70 °C, 5 min at 37 °C). Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and resultant supernatants were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. Protein concentration was quantified using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit. For caspase-3 activity, 16 μg of lysates were added to a fluorogenic substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC) (Calbiochem) that contains the caspase-3 cleavage site, DEVD, for 2 h at 37 °C. The release of free AMC was measured by a fluorometer. Caspase-8 activity was detected by adding the fluorometric substrate IETD-AFC (Biovision) by a 96-well fluorescent plate reader. Caspase-9 activity was determined by cleavage of LEHD-p-nitroanilide using a caspase-9 colorimetric assay (R & D Systems). Immunoblot—Cells were rinsed with PBS, released from the dish with trypsin, centrifuged, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A). The cells were disrupted by forcing them through a 25-gauge needle, centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant retained. For each sample to be analyzed, 50 μg of protein was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked in buffer with 5% dry milk and incubated with the following antibodies: anti-caspase-12 (Cell Signaling) and anti-actin (Sigma). The blots were then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody followed by ECL development. Caspase-12 Immunostaining—Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells/cm2 onto fetal calf serum-coated glass coverslips and cultured for 24 h in complete medium. The cultures were continued either in complete medium or in medium containing 5 μm A23187 for 24 h. The cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% normal donkey serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 min and for an additional 2 h in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal donkey serum with rabbit anti-caspase-12 antibody (1:50) (Cell Signaling). To label the ER, we also included an antibody recognizing grp78 (Bip, a chaperone protein localized to the ER) in the incubation mixture (goat anti-GRP78 antibody, Santa Cruz). The cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% normal donkey serum with donkey anti-rabbit-IgG cyanine-2 antibody (1:50) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc., West Grove, PA) and donkey anti-goat-IgG cyanine-3 antibody (1:50) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc, West Grove, PA). To label the nuclei, the cells were rinsed with PBS and treated with 0.1 μg/ml DAPI for 30 min in the dark. The coverslips were mounted, and the images were acquired with a Zeiss Atto Arc HBO 110-watt upright microscope (13Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). Measurement of Intracellular Calcium Level—Cells were grown in complete medium with or without 5 μm A23187 for the time interval indicated previously. Floating and adherent cells were collected, centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 5 min, and washed with PBS. The cells were stained with 3 μm indo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (indo-1 AM) (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 30 min prior to analysis. Indo-1 AM was excited by an Innova 300 UV laser with a 50 nm band-pass filter used for detection. Intracellular calcium ion concentration was assessed by calculating the 325/450 nm ratio (22Lee S.T.

Data Analysis—All data points represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Overexpression of eIF4E Rescues Cells from Endoplasmic Reticulum Stressor-induced Apoptosis—Cellular perturbations leading to apoptosis primarily operate through two organelles, the mitochondrion and the ER. We reported previously that ectopic expression of the mRNA 5′ cap-binding protein, eIF4E, rescues cells from growth factor withdrawal and cell cycle-active drugs, which are apoptogenic stimuli that activate the mitochondrial death pathway (23Tan A. Bitterman P. Sonenberg N. Peterson M. Polunovsky V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Li S. Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Peterson M. Avdulov S. Polunovsky V.A. Bitterman P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2853-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). ER stress can be exerted by inhibiting one of its Ca2+ pumps with thapsigargin by disrupting cytosolic calcium homeostasis with Ca2+ ionophores or by triggering the unfolded protein response with the protein glycation inhibitors tunicamycin and brefeldin A. Treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with each class of ER stressor resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis, ranging from 15.35% for brefeldin A to 78.845% for A23187 (peak responses shown in Fig. 1A). In marked contrast, ectopic overexpression of eIF4E (3T3/4E) nearly abolished apoptosis in response to each of the ER stressors. Detailed analysis of NIH 3T3 cell apoptosis in response to calcium ionophore A23187 showed it to be strictly concentration- and time-dependent, whereas only minimal apoptosis was triggered in 3T3/4E cells (Fig. 1, B and C). These data indicate that eIF4E potently antagonizes ER stressor-mediated apoptosis and identify Ca2+ ionophore as the most potent ER stressor in our cell system. Calcium Ionophore A23187 Has Similar Potency in Cells Expressing either Physiological or Ectopic eIF4E—Because calcium ionophore A23187 is thought to trigger apoptosis by disrupting intracellular calcium homeostasis (13Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar), it was possible that A23187 affects calcium permeability differently in NIH 3T3 and 3T3/4E cells. To evaluate this, we treated NIH 3T3 and 3T3/4E cells with 5 μm A23187 for up to 60 min and measured intracellular calcium levels. Under basal conditions, the Ca2+ concentration is higher in the ER (10-100 μm) than in the cytoplasm (100-300 nm), and this gradient is maintained by an ATP-dependent pump designated SERCA (smooth ER Ca2+ ATPase) (25Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. Chan S.L. Leissring M.A. Shepel P.N. Geiger J.D. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 222-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). To measure intracellular calcium levels, cells were loaded with 4 μm fura-2-AM, washed with buffer, and monitored every 5 min for 1 h. When the cells were treated with A23187, there was a rapid increase in cytoplasmic calcium, which returned to the base line after a few minutes. The amplitude and duration of the Ca2+ elevation was comparable in both NIH 3T3 and 3T3/4E cells (Fig. 2). Thus, eIF4E rescue does not result from differential efficacy of the ionophore. Ectopic Expression of eIF4E Prevents A23187 Activation of Caspase-3 and Upstream Caspases—The cleavage of procaspase-3 (32 kDa) into its active 17-kDa form is a downstream step common to most forms of apoptosis (7Saleh A.

To investigate the impact of overexpressed eIF4E on this critical node in apoptotic signaling, we quantified caspase-3 activity in NIH 3T3 and 3T3/4E cells after imposition of an ER stress. Treatment of NIH 3T3 cells with 5 μm A23187 activated caspase-3 as early as 18 h, with a peak level measured at 24 h (Fig. 3). In marked contrast, the cells ectopically expressing eIF4E did not activate caspase-3 (Fig. 3). Caspase-8 and caspase-9 lie upstream of caspase-3. For death receptor-mediated apoptosis, oligomerization of death receptors through adaptor proteins leads to caspase-8 activation, which in turn cleaves and activates caspase-3 (27Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5126) Google Scholar, 28Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). For the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, various noxious stimuli cause cytochrome c release, which promotes formation of the cytochrome·Apaf-1·procaspase-9 complex, which leads to caspase-9 activation. Activated caspase-9 in turn cleaves and activates caspase-3 (7Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar). Even though these pathways are distinct in some cell systems, in others, cross-talk between them has been documented (29Hacki J. Egger L. Monney L. Conus S. Rosse T. Fellay I. Borner C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2286-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 30Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3773) Google Scholar). Cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 in response to the activation of cell surface death receptors causes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and leads to apoptosis (30Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3068) Google Scholar, 31Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3773) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that ER stressors do not directly activate caspase-8 but could activate caspase-9 in an Apaf-1- and cytochrome c-independent manner (17Morishima N. Nakanishi K. Takenouchi H. Shibata T. Yasuhiko Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34287-34294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 18Rao R.V. Castro-Obregon S. Frankowski H. Schuler M.

We therefore examined whether A23187 causes apoptosis by direct or indirect activation of caspase-8 or caspase-9 in our system rather than through the posited activation of caspase-12. When NIH 3T3 cells were treated with A23187, neither caspase-8 nor caspase-9 were activated (Fig. 4), indicating that in our cell system, A23187-induced apoptosis was independent of the classical death receptor or mitochondria-dependent pathways. Overexpressed eIF4E Prevents Activation of ER Caspase-12—Caspase-12 localizes in the ER and mediates ER-specific apoptosis (13Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). To determine whether caspase-12 played a role in our system, we treated cells with A23187 for 24 h and detected caspase-12 activation by immunoblot. Caspase-12, like other caspases, requires cleavage of its prodomain for its enzymatic function (10Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar). We used a caspase-12 antibody, which detects both full-length and cleaved caspase-12, and found cleaved caspase-12 only in NIH 3T3 cells but not in 3T3/4E (Fig. 5A). Caspase-12 is reported to be predominantly associated with the ER (13Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, morphological analysis demonstrated that caspase-12 was localized mainly in a punctate cytoplasmic pattern (green granules) in both NIH 3T3 and 3T3/4E cells in their basal state. The caspase-12 signal was frequently found to be co-localized (orange granules) with the ER marker grp78 (Bip) (red granules) (Fig. 5B). However, after treatment with A23187, the caspase-12 signal in NIH 3T3 cells appeared in a diffuse pattern, suggesting it was translocated from the ER to the cytosol (Fig. 5B). As expected from the apoptosis data, condensed nuclei and decreased cell numbers were also apparent. In contrast, the morphological pattern of the eIF4E signal remained punctate in cells ectopically expressing eIF4E (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that caspase-12, the signature ER stress caspase, is not activated in cells rescued from calcium ionophore-induced apoptosis by eIF4E. Ectopic Expression of eIF4E Inhibits ER Calcium Release—Calcium release from the ER is the hallmark apoptotic event after prolonged calcium ionophore treatment and is thought to lie upstream of caspase-12 activation in the ER-mediated apoptotic pathway (13Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). To examine intracellular calcium concentration in our system, NIH 3T3 and 3T3/4E cells were incubated in complete medium with or without 5 μm A23187 for the time intervals indicated (Fig. 6). The cells were collected and stained with the calcium-binding dye indo-1, and the signal was quantified by flow cytometry. In response to A23187, the intracellular calcium level increased more than"

https://openalex.org/W1998876947,"c-Myc plays an essential role in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Because of its relevance to cancer, most studies have focused on the cellular consequences of c-Myc overexpression. Here, we address the role of physiological levels of c-Myc in drug-induced apoptosis. By using c-MYC null cells we confirm and extend recent reports showing a c-Myc requirement for the induction of apoptosis by a number of anticancer agents. In particular, we show that c-Myc is required for the induction of apoptosis by doxorubicin and etoposide, whereas it is not required for camptothecin-induced cell death. We have investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in executing doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and show caspase-3 activation by both mitochondria-dependent and -independent pathways. Moreover, serine proteases participate in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis partly by contributing to caspase-3 activation. Finally, a complete rescue from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis is obtained only when serine proteases, caspase-3, and mitochondrial activation are inhibited simultaneously. Interestingly, doxorubicin requires c-Myc for the activation of all of these pathways. Our findings therefore support a model in which doxorubicin simultaneously triggers multiple c-Myc-dependent apoptosis pathways. c-Myc plays an essential role in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

Interestingly, doxorubicin requires c-Myc for the activation of all of these pathways. Our findings therefore support a model in which doxorubicin simultaneously triggers multiple c-Myc-dependent apoptosis pathways. The nuclear proto-oncogene c-MYC (hereafter called MYC) encodes a sequence-specific transcription factor, which plays an essential role in important cellular processes as different as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis (1Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). A role for Myc in regulating apoptosis was first demonstrated by studies in which overexpression of Myc under growth-limiting conditions resulted in cell death (2Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922PubMed Google Scholar, 3Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). The dual capacity of Myc to stimulate cell proliferation in the presence of the appropriate survival factor(s) and to trigger apoptosis in their absence ensures that cell growth is strictly controlled by the microenvironment (3Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). Subsequent results have shown that Myc-induced apoptosis requires interaction at the cell surface between Fas and its ligand (FasL) and that Myc acts downstream of the Fas receptor by sensitizing cells to the Fas death signal (4Hueber A.O. Zornig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G.I. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that this sensitization step is represented by cytochrome c release (5Juin, P., Hueber, A. O., Littlewood T., and Evan, G. I. Genes Dev. 13, 1367-1381Google Scholar). Myc has also been reported to sensitize cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis (6Klefstrom J. Vastrik I. Saksela E. Valle J. Eilers M. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5442-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, deregulation or overexpression of Myc enhances the apoptotic response to different inducers, such as cytokine withdrawal, glucose deprivation, hypoxia, DNA damage, and cancer therapeutics (7Sears R.C. Nevins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11617-11620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Most data presented so far have dealt with the role of overexpressed Myc in inducing apoptosis. However, Myc also appears to have a role in regulating apoptosis when it is expressed at physiological levels. For instance, antisense oligonucleotides specifically blocking Myc expression resulted in a reduction of T-cell receptor activation-induced death (8Shi Y. Glynn J.M. Guilbert J. Cotter T.G. Bissonnette R.P. Green D.R. Science. 1992; 257: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In addition, Sedivy and co-workers (9Adachi S. Obaya A.J. Han Z. Ramos-Desimone N. Wyche J.H. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) recently reported that cells lacking Myc are resistant to cell death induced by etoposide. Moreover, they showed that the defect in DNA damage-initiated apoptosis in the G2 phase of the cell cycle was rescued by ectopic expression of Cyclin A, thus linking DNA damage-induced apoptosis and cell cycle progression (9Adachi S. Obaya A.J. Han Z. Ramos-Desimone N. Wyche J.H. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Somewhat contrasting results using the same cell line was reported by Soucie et al. (10Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In fact, these investigators showed that in absence of Myc, cells could undergo cytochrome c-independent cell death when treated with etoposide and suggested that Myc regulates a mitochondrial amplification step (10Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To clarify these contrasting results we decided to use the same cellular model to further investigate the role of Myc in drug-induced apoptosis. In this study we have confirmed that the absence of Myc impairs the apoptotic response to etoposide and to another topoisomerase II inhibitor, doxorubicin. Moreover, we have shown that the absence of Myc does not affect camptothecin-induced apoptosis and that it has intermediary effects of the ability of taxol and staurosporine to induce apoptosis. Furthermore, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Here, we report that together with the classical mitochondrial pathway, doxorubicin triggers two other pathways involved in executing cell death. Interestingly, we show that all these apoptotic pathways are impaired in Myc-deficient cells. Finally, we demonstrate that one of the pathways contributing to the cell death process induced by doxorubicin is represented by the activation of serine proteases, which occurs in parallel and upstream of caspase activation. Reagents—Etoposide, doxorubicin, taxol, camptothecin, staurosporine, tosyl lysine chloromethyl ketone, pepstatin A, CA-074 Me, MDL28170, and E64d were purchased from Calbiochem Pharmaceuticals. The Fas ligand kit was from Upstate Biotechnology. MFL4 was from Pharmingen. Cell Culture and Stable Cell Lines—TGR-1 and HO15.19 Rat1 fibroblasts were a kind gift of J.

All the derived clones described in this paper were obtained by retroviral infection and selection with the appropriate antibiotic as described previously (13Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G. Cartwright P. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6379-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Briefly, Phoenix cells were plated at a density of 2 million cells/10-cm diameter dish, and 2 days later cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA. Supernatants were collected after 1 and 2 days, filtered, and used to infect HO15.19 cells. The viral supernatant was left on the cells in the presence of Polybrene (8 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 h, and the procedure was repeated twice for 2 days to increase the efficiency of infection. Two days after infection, infected cultures were split, and resistant cells were selected in medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic (5 μg/ml puromycin or 250 μg/ml hygromycin) and used as bulk populations or cloned by limiting dilution. Clones successfully re-expressing Myc were screened for reconstitution of the apoptotic phenotype upon doxorubicin treatment. Only clones achieving levels of apoptosis similar to parental TGR-1 and clones overexpressing BclXL levels comparable with those observed in HO15.19 were used. In case of cells infected with GFP-crmA vector, after the infection cells were FACS-sorted to isolate only GFP-positive cells. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Assessment of Apoptosis—Subconfluent growing cells were seeded at a density of 0.3 × 106 in a 6-well plate and were treated with the indicated drugs 8-12 h after plating. At different time points after apoptosis induction, floating cells were pooled with those harvested by trypsinization, and the cells were fixed by gently resuspending the solution in 70% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were kept at 4 °C until further processing. Fixed cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin before staining for 1 h at room temperature with a solution of 5 mg/ml propidium iodide containing 2.5 mg/ml RNase. Cytofluorimetric analysis was performed by FACStar using the CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Each experiment was repeated 3-5 times, and standard deviation values were calculated. Colony Assay—Subconfluent growing cells were seeded at a density of 0.3 × 106 in a 6-well plate and were treated with 0.01 mg/ml doxorubicin 12 h after plating. Twenty-four hours after doxorubicin addition cells were trypsinized, counted, and reseeded at a low density (10,000 cells in a 10-cm dish) in duplicate. Medium was replaced every 3 days, and after 2 weeks colonies were fixed and stained in 1% crystal violet, 35% ethanol. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze/thawing in CHAPS buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, aprotinin 10 mg/ml, leupeptin 10 mg/ml, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol). For PARP immunodetection cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (10% glycerol, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Protein concentration was determined on cleared lysates using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH), and Western blots were performed as described previously (13Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G. Cartwright P. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6379-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-p53 (FL-393), anti Bax (B-9), and anti-caspase-3 (H-277) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-vinculin (V9131) and anti-Actin (AC-40, Sigma-Aldrich); anti poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (clone C2-10) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN); anti-Bcl-X (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp-175) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Permeabilization and staining with monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (clone 6H2.B4, Pharmingen) was performed according to Goldstein et al. (14Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Cells were counterstained with DAPI. Fluorogenic Assay for Caspase-3/7 Activity—Cell lysates were obtained as described for immunoblotting. 30 mg/ml proteins were used for fluorogenic assays as described (15Del Bello B.

Briefly, lysates were incubated with the synthetic substrate ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (ac-DEVD-AMC, Alexis) (40 μm) in an assay buffer containing 100 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 10% sucrose, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, supplemented with the protease inhibitors aprotinin and leupeptin (20 mg/ml each), pepstatin (1 mg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate was monitored for 15 min by amido-4-methylcoumarin release in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (excitation/emission wavelengths 380/460 nm). Caspase activity was expressed as arbitrary units of fluorescence/min/mg of protein, and the values obtained at each time point were divided by the value of the relative untreated sample to obtain the -fold increase. Myc-deficient Cells Are Resistant to Topoisomerase II Inhibitors and Display Different Levels of Sensitivity toward Other Cytotoxic Drugs—To confirm previous reports in which Myc was shown to play a physiological role in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (9Adachi S.

Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), Myc wild type (wt) (TGR-1) and MYC null (HO15.19) cells were incubated with increasing doses of a selection of chemotherapeutic drugs, and the level of apoptosis was assessed by FACS analysis at different time points between 24 and 72 h (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The drugs tested are currently employed in cancer therapy and are representative of different classes of compounds known to affect different targets. As evident from the data presented in Fig. 1 MYC null cells, despite showing a higher rate of spontaneous cell death than the parental cells in untreated cultures, were resistant to topoisomerase II inhibitors up to relative high concentrations. In fact, a 20-fold higher concentration of etoposide was needed to induce apoptosis to a similar extent in MYC null fibroblasts as compared with wt fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). The difference was even more striking in the case of doxorubicin where a 30-fold higher concentration of the drug killed 25% less MYC null cells as compared with wt cells (Fig. 1B). Loss of Myc expression also partially impaired the apoptotic response toward taxol and staurosporine (Fig. 1, C and D), though to a different extent. As reported previously (9Adachi S. Obaya A.J. Han Z. Ramos-Desimone N. Wyche J.H. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), MYC null cells are not resistant to all apoptotic stimuli, because a normal apoptotic response was triggered when HO15.19 cells were treated with camptothecin (Fig. 1E). To study in more detail the mechanism by which MYC null cells are resistant to drug-induced apoptosis, we decided to use doxorubicin as a model drug, because even at very low doses it is very active toward wt cells but completely ineffective toward MYC null cells. Myc Status Determines the Resistance to Apoptosis of HO15.19 Cells—The apoptotic defect in HO15.19 cells was revealed using drugs whose apoptotic effect is known to be dependent, completely or in part, on the presence of wild type p53 (reviewed in Ref. 16Chang E.H. Pirollo K.F. Bouker K.B. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 358-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Previous data have suggested (9Adachi S. Obaya A.J. Han Z. Ramos-Desimone N. Wyche J.H. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4929-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that TGR-1 and HO15.19 cells contain wild type p53 and that the induction of p53 in HO15.19 is partly impaired upon treatment with etoposide and cisplatin. To understand whether the treatment of TGR-1 and HO15.19 cells with doxorubicin results in stabilization of p53, we treated the cells with 0.01 μg/ml doxorubicin for 24 h and determined the level of p53 by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, the treatment of the cells resulted in a robust accumulation of p53 with no differences observed between the MYC null and wt cell lines. Moreover, the accumulation of Bax, a classical p53 target involved in apoptosis (17Shen Y. White E. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 55-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), following doxorubicin treatment strongly suggests that functional p53 is induced in the two cell lines (Fig. 2B). Our data therefore suggest that, at least for some kinds of drugs, p53 induction alone is not sufficient but that a concomitant presence of Myc is necessary to induce apoptosis after DNA damage. Moreover, the apoptotic defect was specifically due to the loss of Myc and not to secondary mutations accumulated as a consequence of Myc absence, because re-expression of Myc in HO15.19 cells rescued doxorubicin-induced apoptosis both in short term (Fig. 2C) and in long term (Fig. 2D) assays. Lack of Effector-Caspase Activation in myc Null Cells—The signaling cascades triggered once the apoptotic stimulus is recognized as such (induction phase) can be largely modulated, mainly by the Bcl2 family of apoptotic regulators (decision phase), before the apoptotic program is executed via activation of the caspases (execution phase). Because we observed that the Bcl2 family member Bax is induced both in TGR-1 and HO15.19 cells, we concluded that the induction phase and at least part of the decision phase are not impaired even in absence of functional Myc. To assess whether the apoptotic process is blocked at the level of the execution phase in MYC null cells, we monitored the integrity of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) as a marker of caspase activation (Fig. 2E). The cleavage product of PARP is evident upon doxorubicin treatment of TGR-1 and 7M3 cells but is absent in HO15.19 cells, indicating that Myc is required to activate the execution program in response to doxorubicin treatment. Defective activation of caspases however, is not a generic defect of MYC null cells, because PARP is normally cleaved when HO15.19 cells are exposed to camptothecin. The Activation of the Fas (CD95) Receptor Is Not Required for Doxorubicin-induced Apoptosis—Chemotherapeutic drugs have been reported to activate effector caspases either via death receptor-mediated activation of caspase-8 (extrinsic pathway) or via mitochondria-mediated activation of caspase-9 (intrinsic pathway) (18Reed J.C. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). To understand whether the resistance to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in MYC null cells is because of a defective activation of Fas/FasL, we incubated TGR-1 and HO15.19 cells with 25 ng/ml purified FasL and assessed the level of apoptosis by FACS analysis (Fig. 3A). Because no differences were evident, we concluded that the resistance of MYC null cells to doxorubicin is not because of an intrinsic defect in the activation of the Fas receptor. Subsequently, we tested whether doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in wt cells requires Fas/FasL engagement at the cell surface. TGR-1 cells were exposed to 0.01 μg/ml doxorubicin in the presence or absence of 30 μg/ml MFL4, an antagonistic antibody able to block the activation of Fas. As a control we treated TGR-1 cells with 25 ng/ml purified FasL in the presence or absence of 30 μg/ml MFL4. As expected, MFL4 co-incubation prevented FasL-induced apoptosis. However, it did not decrease the percentage of cell death induced by doxorubicin (Fig 3B) demonstrating that blocking Fas/FasL engagement at the cell surface does not affect doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Anticancer drugs may trigger apoptosis also by acting directly on different components of the Fas signaling pathway, e.g. by triggering a Fas ligand-independent, FADD-mediated activation of the Fas death pathway (19Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Dimanche-Boitrel M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7987-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Moreover, anticancer drugs can directly activate caspase-8, the upstream caspase in the Fas pathway, in a Fas-independent manner (20Kim P.K. Mahidhara R. Seol D.W. Drug Resist. Updat. 2001; 4: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To assess the involvement of FADD or caspase-8 in doxorubicin-induced cell death, TGR-1 cells were infected with retroviruses expressing dominant negative (DN) versions of human caspase-8 or human FADD. The “empty” retrovirus (Pinco) was used as control. Forty-eight hours after infection the cells were treated with 0.01 μg/ml doxorubicin or 25 ng/ml FasL as a positive control, and 72 h after treatment the percentage of apoptosis was evaluated by FACS analysis of GFP-positive cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, DN caspase-8 and FADD proteins efficiently blocked FasL-induced apoptosis. However, doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was neither inhibited nor delayed by the two DN proteins. These data demonstrate that Fas/FasL and caspase-8 are dispensable for doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Subsequently, we sought to determine whether the mitochondrial pathway mediates doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in TGR-1 cells (Fig. 3D). Cytochrome c release was studied by immunofluorescence in cells treated with doxorubicin or, as a positive control, with camptothecin. In healthy cells cytochrome c is mitochondrial as indicated by the typical punctuate distribution of the staining in all cell lines (Fig. 3D, a, c, and e). Following doxorubicin treatment of TGR-1 and 7M3 cells, the staining becomes intense and diffuse, which is consistent with a cytoplasmic distribution of cytochrome c released from mitochondria, (Fig. 3D, g and k). This staining pattern was not observed in HO15.19 cells (Fig. 3D, i) indicating that the block in the apoptotic machinery resides upstream of the mitochondria. Once again, the defect is specifically related to the inability of MYC null cells to die in response to doxorubicin, because cytochrome c is released as result of camptothecin treatment (Fig. 3D, o). Overexpression of BclXL Is Not Sufficient to Inhibit Doxorubicin-induced Apoptosis—To understand whether the inability to activate the mitochondrial pathway could account for the lack of drug-induced apoptosis in MYC null cells, we tested whether an exogenously applied mitochondrial block would be sufficient to abolish doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. To this end, we infected TGR-1 cells with a retrovirus overexpressing human BclXL, a member of the Bcl2 family, which blocks the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (21Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 21-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Several clones were obtained that overexpressed BclXL, and when we tested BclXL expression we discovered that compared with TGR-1 HO15.19 cells expressed very high levels of endogenous BclXL, similar to those of the overexpressing clones. We found that the high levels of BclXL are a consequence of the absence of Myc, because re-expression of Myc in 7M3 cells restored BclXL expression to normal levels (Fig. 4A). The finding that HO15.19 cells express high levels of BclXL could account for the inability of these cells to release cytochrome c upon doxorubicin stimulation. We then tested several clones for their biological response to doxorubicin, and to our surprise none of the tested clones was protected from apoptosis, despite expressing high levels of BclXL (Fig. 4B and data not shown). A possible explanation for the lack of protection could be that the overexpressed BclXL is mislocalized and/or non-functional. However, immunofluorescence studies showed that BclXL was correctly localized at the mitochondria, because in untreated cells the signal from BclXL colocalized with that from cytochrome c (Fig. 4C, f). Moreover, we observed that overexpressed BclXL is functional, because it blocks cytochrome c release after doxorubicin exposure (Fig. 4D, compare d with h). Despite that, BclXL is not able to prevent apoptosis as evident from the typical morphological features such as condensation and fragmentation of the nuclei (Fig. 4D, c and g). However, a modest but reproducible delay in the onset of the apoptotic process was observed in all of the experiments performed with BclXL overexpressing clones (data not shown). These findings suggest that the mitochondrial pathway is not the only executor of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in TGR-1 cells and that an alternative pathway is activated upstream or concomitantly when cells are exposed to the drug. A corollary emerging directly from these observations is that this second pathway is also under the control of Myc, because the mitochondrial block described in MYC null cells cannot account solely for the resistant phenotype. Inhibition of Caspase-3 Activation Does Not Protect TGR-1 Cells from Doxorubicin-induced Apoptosis—As shown in Fig. 5A, we observed cleaved, and therefore active, caspase-3 in the presence of a mitochondrial block obtained by BclXL overexpression. We therefore sought to determine whether caspase-3 is the pivotal activator/effector of the alternative pathway triggered by doxorubicin. To this end we infected both TGR-1 and TGR-1-BclXL with a XIAP point mutant (W310A) that does not interact with caspase-9 and only inhibits caspase-3/7 (22Bratton S.B. Lewis J. Butterworth M. Duckett C.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, the W310A mutant suppressed most of the caspase-3/7 activity elicited by doxorubicin treatment in both TGR-1 and in TGR-1-BclXL. Unexpectedly, W310A overexpression, although being able to slightly delay the onset of cell death in TGR-1-BclXL, did not prevent the cumulative number of cell deaths (Fig. 5C). A later Smac- and/or HtrA2/Omi-mediated relief of caspase inhibition, following the release of these proteins from activated mitochondria, might explain the finding that W310A overexpression is not able to suppress cell death in TGR-1 cells. In agreement with such a notion, we detected a residual caspase-3/7 activity in cells expressing W310A (Fig. 5B). However, residual caspase-3/7 activity is present also in TGR-1-BclXL-W310A where Smac and/or HtrA2/Omi release should be blocked as a consequence of mitochondrial protection afforded by BclXL overexpression. These observations led us to search for additional and non-conventional mechanisms of caspase-3 activation triggered by doxorubicin. Serine Protease Activation Occurs prior to Early Caspase Activation in Doxorubicin-induced Apoptosis—Recent studies (reviewed in Refs. 23Johnson D.E. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2000; 14: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar and 24Leist M. Jäättelä M. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 1-10Crossref Scopus (1380) Google Scholar) have indicated that proteases other than caspases (including cathepsins, calpains, and serine proteases) also have roles in mediating and promoting apoptosis. In fact, their inhibition completely, or in some cases partially, prevents cell death induced by different stimuli. Moreover, depending on the cell type and on the inducer non-caspase proteases can be activated either upstream or downstream of caspases. To investigate whether non-caspase proteases could play a role in activating caspase-3 and/or executing cell death upon doxorubicin treatment, we induced apoptosis in presence or absence of increasing concentrations of different protease inhibitors. No protection was observed when pre-incubating cells with 0-200 μm pepstatin A (cathepsin D inhibitor), 0-800 μm CA-074 Me (cathepsin B inhibitor), 0-200 μm MDL28170 (calpain I/II inhibitor), and 0-400 μm E64d"
https://openalex.org/W2082544879,"RNA interference of Sm proteins in Trypanosoma brucei demonstrated that the stability of the small nuclear RNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5) and the spliced leader RNA, but not U6 RNA, were affected upon Sm depletion (Mandelboim, M., Barth, S., Biton, M., Liang, X. H., and Michaeli, S. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 51469–51478), suggesting that Lsm proteins that bind and stabilize U6 RNA in other eukaryotes should exist in trypanosomes. In this study, we identified seven Lsm proteins (Lsm2p to Lsm8p) and examined the function of Lsm3p and Lsm8p by RNA interference silencing. Both Lsm proteins were found to be essential for U6 stability and mRNA decay. Silencing was lethal, and cis- and trans-splicing were inhibited. Importantly, silencing also affected the level of U4.U6 and the U4.U6/U5 tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes. The presence of Lsm proteins in trypanosomes that diverged early in the eukaryotic lineage suggests that these proteins are highly conserved in both structure and function among eukaryotes. Interestingly, however, Lsm1p that is specific to the mRNA decay complex was not identified in the genome data base of any kinetoplastidae, and the Lsm8p that in other eukaryotes exclusively functions in U6 stability was found to function in trypanosomes also in mRNA decay. These data therefore suggest that in trypanosomes only a single Lsm complex may exist. RNA interference of Sm proteins in Trypanosoma brucei demonstrated that the stability of the small nuclear RNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5) and the spliced leader RNA, but not U6 RNA, were affected upon Sm depletion (Mandelboim, M., Barth, S., Biton, M., Liang, X.

Pre-mRNA splicing requires five small nuclear RNPs 1The abbreviations used are: RNP, ribonucleoprotein; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; SL, spliced leader; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; EST, expressed sequence tag; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA. 1The abbreviations used are: RNP, ribonucleoprotein; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; SL, spliced leader; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; RT, reverse transcriptase; EST, expressed sequence tag; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA.: the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs. The first four snRNPs consist of an RNA molecule and core proteins, known as Sm proteins, as well as particle-specific proteins. In vertebrates, the binding of Sm proteins to the snRNA takes place in the cytoplasm and is required for the hypermethylation of the 5′ cap structure and for the import of snRNPs into the nucleus (1Will C.L. Lührmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 290-301Google Scholar). The Sm proteins are low molecular mass proteins ranging in size from 8 to 28 kDa and are characterized by bipartite sequence motifs, termed Sm 1 and Sm 2 (2Hermann H. Fabrizio P. Raker V.A. Foulaki K. Hornig H. Brahms H. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2076-2088Google Scholar, 3Seraphin B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2089-2098Google Scholar). The Sm motifs function in protein-protein interactions (4He W. Parker R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 346-350Google Scholar) and are separated by a variable loop sequence. The seven Sm proteins, SmB, D1, D2, D3, E, F, and G, assemble to snRNP from B.D3, D1.D2, and E.F.G sub-particles to form a doughnut-shaped complex (5Kastner B. Bach M. Lührmann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1710-1714Google Scholar). None of the individual Sm proteins binds stably to RNA; instead, the Sm proteins interact via their Sm motifs to form a heptameric ring around the snRNAs. The RNA binding site is generated only after the formation of Sm protein heteromers (6Raker V.A. Plessel G. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2256-2269Google Scholar). In addition to the canonical Sm proteins, other proteins carrying the Sm motifs have been identified in many eukaryotes. In yeast, nine such proteins exist that were designated Lsm (Sm-like) proteins. Two functionally distinct heptameric complexes of these Lsm proteins were characterized. One complex containing Lsm2p-Lsm8p binds to the 3′ end U tract of U6 snRNA in the nucleus and is required for the stable accumulation of U6 snRNA (7Terns M.P. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3032-3040Google Scholar, 8Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Google Scholar). In addition, these proteins are required for the formation of the U4.U6 and U4.U6/U5 complexes (8Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Google Scholar, 9Mayes A.E. Verdone L. Legrain P. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4321-4331Google Scholar). Depletion of Lsm proteins caused splicing defects, resulting in the accumulation of pre-mRNA (9Mayes A.E. Verdone L. Legrain P. Beggs J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4321-4331Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Lsm2p-Lsm8p complex purified from human cells was found to form a doughnut-shaped structure analogous to the structure formed in the canonical Sm complex, except that the Lsm complex formation can occur in the absence of RNA (8Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Google Scholar). Among these Lsm proteins, five (Lsm2p-5p and Lsm8p) are essential for cell growth (10Kufel J. Allmang C. Verdone L. Beggs J.D. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5248-5256Google Scholar). The second Lsm complex, consisting of Lsm1p-Lsm7p, functions in mRNA decay in the cytoplasm, most probably in the decapping step. By tagging the Lsm1p protein in yeast, it was demonstrated that the complex also carries, in addition to the Lsm1p-7p proteins, the Pat1 and Xrn1 exonucleases (11Bouveret E. Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1661-1671Google Scholar). It was also shown that the yeast Lsm1p mutant stabilized mRNAs (12Boeck R. Lapeyre B. Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5062-5072Google Scholar) and that depletion of Lsm1p, 6p, and 7p in yeast affected mRNA stability, suggesting that the Lsm1p-7p complex is required for mRNA decay (11Bouveret E. Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1661-1671Google Scholar). The function and components of these complexes seem to be also conserved in humans, because the Lsm1p homologue, CaSm, was not found in human U4.U6/U5 complex (8Achsel T. Brahms H. Kastner B. Bachi A. Wilm M. Lührmann R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5789-5802Google Scholar), and Lsm8p was not co-localized with mRNA degradation enzymes (Dcp1/2 and Xrn1) in cytoplasm (13Ingelfinger D. Arndt-Jovin D.J. Lührmann R. Achsel T. RNA. 2002; 8: 1489-1501Google Scholar). Lsm proteins appear to have additional functions apart from stabilization of U6 snRNA and mRNA. The Lsm2p-8p complex was also shown to bind U8 snoRNA in Xenopus (14Tomasevic N. Peculis B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4101-4112Google Scholar), and yeast U7 snoRNA binds to Lsm proteins (15Pillai R.S. Will C.L. Lührmann R. Schumperli D. Muller B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5470-5479Google Scholar), suggesting that Lsm proteins may play a role in the stabilization of other small stable RNAs. In yeast, Lsm proteins were shown to be required for pre-tRNA and pre-rRNA processing (10Kufel J. Allmang C. Verdone L. Beggs J.D. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5248-5256Google Scholar, 16Kufel J. Allmang C. Petfalski E. Beggs J. Tollervey D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2147-2156Google Scholar). Lsm2p-7p but not other Lsm proteins associate with pre-RNase P RNA (17Salgado-Garrido J. Bragado-Nilsson E. Kandels-Lewis S. Seraphin B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3451-3462Google Scholar). The existence of a Sm-like protein SmAP in Archaea implies that Sm proteins had an ancient origin in nature (18Mura C. Cascio D. Sawaya M.R. Eisenberg D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5532-5537Google Scholar). In fact, an Sm motif containing protein, Hfq, was also found in Escherichia coli (19Arluison V. Derreumaux P. Allemand F. Folichon M. Hajnsdorf E. Regnier P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 705-712Google Scholar). These proteins are active only after the formation of a ring structure (20Collins B.M. Harrop S.J. Kornfeld G.D. Dawes I.W. Curmi P.M. Mabbutt B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 915-923Google Scholar, 21Zhang A. Wassarman K.M. Ortega J. Steven A.C. Storz G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 11-22Google Scholar). Hfq protein was shown to interact with many different regulatory RNAs and to affect the translation and stability of several mRNAs (19Arluison V. Derreumaux P. Allemand F. Folichon M. Hajnsdorf E. Regnier P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 705-712Google Scholar). In addition, Hfq also mediates RNA-RNA interactions (22Moller T. Franch T. Hojrup P. Keene D.R. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Valentin-Hansen P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 23-30Google Scholar). Trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that diverged very early in the eukaryotic lineage (23Stevens J.R. Gibson W. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 432-437Google Scholar). These organisms participate in unique RNA processing events such as trans-splicing and RNA editing (24Liang X.H. Haritan A. Uliel S. Michaeli S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 830-840Google Scholar, 25Simpson L. Sbicego S. Aphasizhev R. RNA. 2003; 9: 265-276Google Scholar). Trans-splicing evolved to separate long polycistronic transcripts. In trypanosomes, all mRNAs undergo trans-splicing, but cis-splicing also exists (26Mair G. Shi H. Li H. Djikeng A. Aviles H.O. Bishop J.R. Falcone F.H. Gavrilescu C. Montgomery J.L. Santori M.I. Stern L.S. Wang Z. Ullu E. Tschudi C. RNA. 2000; 6: 163-169Google Scholar). All spliceosomal U snRNAs were identified in this organism (24Liang X.H. Haritan A. Uliel S. Michaeli S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 830-840Google Scholar). As opposed to their eukaryotic counterparts, the trypanosome U snRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase III (27Nakaar V. Dare A.O. Hong D. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6736-6742Google Scholar). Trypanosome SL RNA, U1, U2, U4, and U5 RNAs associate with Smcore proteins (28Palfi Z. Gunzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9097-9101Google Scholar, 29Goncharov I. Palfi Z. Bindereif A. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12217-12221Google Scholar, 30Palfi Z. Lucke S. Lahm H.W. Lane W.S. Kruft V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 51469-51478Google Scholar). The Sm binding sites on the snRNAs were found to be divergent compared with the canonical site (32Mottram J. Perry K.L. Lizardi P.M. Luhrmann R. Agabian N. Nelson R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1212-1223Google Scholar). The first Sm protein was identified as an SL RNP core protein in Leptomonas collosoma (29Goncharov I. Palfi Z. Bindereif A. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12217-12221Google Scholar). Later, the full set of seven Sm proteins was identified in Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi (30Palfi Z. Lucke S. Lahm H.W. Lane W.S. Kruft V. Bragado-Nilsson E. Seraphin B. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8967-8972Google Scholar), and the proteins have the potential to form the canonical heptameric ring-like structure. The Sm proteins carry bipartite Sm motifs including interesting deviations from the Sm consensus (30Palfi Z. Lucke S. Lahm H.W. Lane W.S. Kruft V. Bragado-Nilsson E. Seraphin B. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8967-8972Google Scholar). In addition, the SmD1 and SmD3 lack the C-terminal RG dipeptide repeats of the human homologues (30Palfi Z. Lucke S. Lahm H.W. Lane W.S. Kruft V. Bragado-Nilsson E. Seraphin B. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8967-8972Google Scholar). The arginine in this domain is methylated in the mammalian protein, constituting an important determinant of the Sm epitope (33Brahms H. Raymackers J. Union A. de Keyser F. Meheus L. Lührmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Google Scholar). The lack of these modifications on the trypanosome proteins may partly explain why the trypanosome Sm proteins are not recognized by the Sm antibodies (28Palfi Z. Gunzl A. Cross M. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9097-9101Google Scholar). Recently, we silenced two Sm proteins by RNAi in T. brucei. Interestingly, whereas the level of U1, U2, U4, and U5 RNAs was reduced, no changes were observed on the level of U6 and the trypanosome-specific small RNA (SLA1) that was shown to guide pseudouridylation on the SL RNA (34Liang X.H. Xu Y.X. Michaeli S. RNA. 2002; 8: 237-246Google Scholar). These data suggest that neither U6 nor SLA1 binds to the canonical Sm proteins. In this study, seven Lsm proteins homologous to the complex Lsm2p-8p were identified in the T. brucei genome data base. The function of two proteins, Lsm3p and Lsm8p, was examined by RNAi silencing. The results indicate that these Lsm proteins associate with U6 snRNA and are required for both trans- and cis-splicing. In the Lsm8-silenced cell line, the level of the U4/U6 and U4.U6/U5 complexes was reduced. Interestingly, Lsm8p that exclusively function in U6 stability in other eukaryotes was found to function in trypanosomes also in mRNA decay. These results suggest that in trypanosomes that diverged early in evolution of eukaryotes the Lsm proteins are highly conserved in both structure and function. However, this organism may possess a single complex that functions in both U6 RNP biogenesis and mRNA decay. Constructs and Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—The stem-loop construct for silencing Lsm8 was established as described in (35Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Google Scholar). Briefly, a 400-bp coding region sequence derived from the Lsm8 (GenBank™ accession number AY551266) gene obtained from the genome data base was amplified with oligonucleotides L8001 and L8003, containing the XbaI and HindIII sites, respectively, and subcloned into the NheI and HindIII site of the pJM326 vector. The PCR fragment was fused with the Pex 11 sequence present in the vector and the 950-bp fused fragment was released from the XbaI and HindIII sites. The same region was PCR-amplified with primers L8001 and L8004, containing the XbaI and MluI sites, respectively. This fragment was subcloned into the Plew 100 vector. The plasmid was further linearized with XbaI and HindIII and ligated with the 950-bp fused fragment derived from pJM326 vector. To silence the Lsm3 gene expression, a 300-bp coding sequence (GenBank™ accession number AY551261) was amplified from the T. brucei genome with oligonucleotides L3001 and L3002, and the PCR fragment was cloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pZJM vector, in between the two opposing T7 promoters. The constructs expressing dsRNA were transfected into the 29–13 parental cell line, and the transformants were selected with 5 μg/ml phelomycin and cloned by limited dilution. The expression of dsRNA was triggered by the addition of 5 μg/ml tetracycline. Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides used were as follows: L8001, 5′-GCTCTAGAATGCTTTCCCAATATCTCAGG-3′, sense, specific to the Lsm8 gene, from position 1 to 20 relative to the start codon, containing an XbaI site; L8003, 5′-CCCAAGCTTCTATCCACCTTTAACTGAA-3′, antisense, complementary to the Lsm8 gene, from position 371 to 389, containing a HindIII site; L8004, 5′-CGACGCGTCTATCCACCTTTAACTGAA-3′, antisense, complementary to the Lsm8 gene, from position 371 to 389, containing a MluI site; L8002, 5′-GCCTCCTCCACCGTATTA-3′, antisense, complementary to the Lsm8 gene, from position 282 to 299; L3001, 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGCAAACTTCTCGCGCC-3′, sense, specific to Lsm3, from –13 to –30, relative to the start codon, containing a XhoI site; L3002, 5′-CCCAAGCTTAACCTGATACGATTGGGG-3′, antisense, complementary to Lsm3, from 223 to 240, relative to the start codon, containing a HindIII site; 45338, 5′-CGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTG-3′, sense, specific to SL RNA, from position 7 to 29; Tubulin-3A, 5′-ATGCAGATAGCCTCACGC-3′, antisense, complementary to the α-tubulin gene, from position 3 to 20, relative to the start codon; SLA-S, 5′-AAAGCTCTTTTATGTAGTGTG-3′, sense, specific to SLA1 RNA, from position 1 to 21; 76A,5′-TCAGTCTGGGCACAATT-3′, antisense, complementary to snoRNA-76 in the SLA1 locus, from position 54 to 70; 92A, 5′-TCAACGTCCATCTGCGACGG-3′, antisense, complementary to snoRNA-92 in the SLA1 locus, from position 31 to 50; TBU1–3A, 5′-CGCTTTCGTTCCCAC-3′, antisense, complementary to U1 snRNA, from position 54 to 68; 14824, 5′-AGCTAAAAAGCCGAGAAGATAT-3′, antisense, complementary to U2 snRNA, from position 34 to 45; 31253, 5′-TCTYGCTCTCCAGTTTCRTG-3′, antisense, complementary to SLA1 RNA, from position 51 to 70; 12407, 5′-AGCTATATCTCTCGAA-3′, antisense, complementary to U6 snRNA, from position 81 to 95; 17036, 5′-GTACCGGATATAGT-3′, antisense, complementary to U4 snRNA, from 60 to 75; 16513, 5′-CCGCTCGAGGACACCCCAAAGTTT-3′, antisense, complementary to U5 snRNA, from position 48 to 62; 76S, 5′-AACATCACAGACTTTGA-3′, sense, specific to snoRNA-76 in the SLA locus, from position 18 to 34; TB7SL-5A, 5′-GAACCCCCGCTTGTCC-3′, antisense, complementary to 7SL RNA, from 60 to 75; P0001, 5′-CCCAACGAAACCACTAGAGG-3′, sense, specific to the first exon of PAP gene, from 223 to 242, relative to the start codon; P0004, 5′-CTGTTCGTCGTCGTGGCA-3′, sense, specific to PAP cis-spliced intron, upstream from 3′ SS, from –133 to –150; P0003, 5′-ATCGACAGCTGTGCCTCTG-3′, antisense, complementary to PAP gene, located 136 bp downstream from the 3′ SS; 9091, 5′-TGCGTCTGTTGGCCC-3′, antisense, complementary to SL RNA, from position 65 to 79; 19796, 5′-CGCCGTTTGCGTTCA-3′, antisense, complementary to 5.8S rRNA, from position 101 to 115; Sno1–5XH, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTACCTATTCCATGCACATT-3′, sense, carrying a XhoI site, specific to the upstream flanking sequence of T. brucei TBC-4 snoRNA, from position –44 to –63; Sno1–3H, 5′-CCCAAGCTTGAGAAGAGTGTGCACTAACC-3′, antisense, carrying a HindIII site, complementary to the downstream flanking sequence of T. brucei TBH1 snoRNA, from position +16 to +35; and 44252, 5′-GGGTGAACAATCCAACCCTT-3′, antisense, complementary to 28 S rRNA, from position 3673 to 3692 (T. brucei, GenBank™ accession number X14553). Northern Analysis—Total RNA (∼30 μg/lane) from induced and uninduced cells was separated on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred onto the membrane. The blot was hybridized at 42 °C overnight with a randomly labeled DNA fragment specific to Lsm3 mRNA or with an end-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to α-tubulin. The same membrane was hybridized again with a 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to 7SL RNA, to examine the amount of RNA in each lane. After hybridization, the membrane was washed at 55 °C when DNA probes were used or at 42 °C when oligonucleotide probes were used. Washing was performed twice, 20 min each with 2× SSC in the presence of 0.1% SDS. To detect the snRNAs, RNA was prepared from sucrose gradient fractions and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel. The membrane was hybridized at 42 °C with 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotides complementary to U4, U5, and U6 RNA, respectively. Primer Extension Analysis—Total RNA (10 μg) from induced and uninduced cells was subjected to primer extension analysis as described (36Xu Y. Liu L. Lopez-Estrano C. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14289-14298Google Scholar). 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotides were used in the extensions to detect the level of U1, U2, U4, U5, U6, SLA1, and SL RNA. To determine the amount of RNA, the level of snoRNA-92 was examined. The extension products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. RT-PCR—Total RNA (50 μg) was incubated with 50 units of RNase-free DNase (RQ I; Promega) at 37 °C for 1 h. After phenol:chloroform extraction, 5 μg of RNA (DNA-free) was used in reverse transcription with 1 unit of reverse transcriptase (RT; Roche Applied Science) in the presence of 100 pmol random primer (Promega). The reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 1 h. The cDNA was used in subsequent PCR reactions. To detect the level of Lsm8 mRNA, oligonucleotides 45338 and L8002 were used to detect the mature mRNA. Oligonucleotides SLA-S and TB-76 were used to detect the level of SLA1 precursor that serves as a control for the quantity and quality of cDNA. To detect the level of mature PAP mRNA, oligonucleotides P0001 and P0003 were used. P0004 and P0003 were used to detect the level of pre-mRNA in PAP.To examine the amount of template used in the PCR reaction, oligonucleotides 76S and 92a were used in the analysis of Lsm8 silencing to amplify the snoRNA precursor in the SLA1 locus or Sno1–5XH and Sno1–3H in the analysis of Lsm3 silencing to detect the TBh1 snoRNA locus. The PCR reaction was performed under the following conditions: 94 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min; 30 cycles. To detect the DNA contamination, DNA-removed total RNA was directly used in a PCR reaction with oligonucleotides SLA-S and Tb-76 to amplify the SLA1 locus in the analysis of Lsm8 mRNA (see Fig. 2) or 92a and 76S in the PAP analysis (see Fig. 6). The RT-PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel and visualized by EtBr staining.Fig. 6Cis-splicing of PAP was affected upon the silencing of both Lsm8 and Lsm3. A, schematic representation of the RT-PCR reaction. B, RT-PCR to detect the level of PAP transcript upon the silencing of Lsm8. RT-PCR was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The PCR reaction was analyzed on 2% agarose gel and visualized by EtBr staining. The mature mRNA is designated by a white arrow, and the precursor is indicated by an open arrow. The precursor of SLA1 locus is marked with a sharp arrow. Templates used in the reactions were as follows: lanes 1, 3, and 5, cDNA from unsilenced cells; lanes 2, 4, and 6, cDNA from induced cells; lanes 7 and 8, RNA from uninduced and induced cells, respectively (control for DNA contamination). Primers used were as follows: lanes 1 and 2, primers for the mature PAP mRNA; lanes 3 and 4, primers for the precursor of PAP; lanes 5–8, primers for the precursor of SLA1 locus (control for the quantity and quality of the cDNA). M, the 1-kb ladder. C, silencing of Lsm3. RT-PCR was performed as described in B. Templates used in the reactions were as follows: lanes 1, 3, and 7, cDNA from uninduced cells; lanes 2, 4, and 8, cDNA from induced cells; and lanes 5 and 6, RNA from uninduced and induced cells, respectively. Primers used were as follows: lanes 1 and 2, primers for the mature PAP mRNA; lanes 3 and 4, primers for the precursor of PAP; lanes 5–8, primers to detect the precursor from the snoRNA TBH1 locus (control for the quality and quantity of cDNA). The products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—Lsm8 silenced or unsilenced cells (109 log-phase) were harvested and washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and Buffer A (35 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 24 mm KCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Cell pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of Buffer A, and Nonidet P-40 was added to make a 0.1% final concentration. Cells were broken by pouncing 20 times with a type A pestle. Salt extracts were prepared by the stepwise addition of KCl to 200 mm. The cell lysate was cleared by 20 min of centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The whole cell extract was layered on 10–30% sucrose gradient containing 200 mm KCl. The gradient was fractionated by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 22 h using an SW41 rotor. Aliquots were collected from top to bottom, and RNA was prepared from fractions and subjected to Northern analysis. Measuring the Half-life of mRNA during Lsm Silencing—About 2 × 108 log phase of Lsm8 and Lsm3 silenced cells (3 days after adding tetracycline) or unsilenced T. brucei cells were harvested. The cell pellet was resuspended with fresh medium carrying all antibiotics required for dsRNA expression. The cells were separated into five tubes, 5 ml in each. Next, actinomycin D was added to make a 10 μg/ml final concentration, and the cells were incubated for 0 to 2 h at 27 °C. RNA was prepared and subjected to Northern analysis as described above. The blot was hybridized with randomly labeled probes specific to SRP19, RHS1 mRNA (kindly provided by Elisabetta Ullu) and subsequently with 5′ end-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to 28 S rRNA to control the amount of RNA on the blot. Identification of Lsm Proteins in Trypanosoma brucei—Silencing of the Sm proteins showed no effect on the level of U6 snRNA (31Mandelboim M. Barth S. Biton M. Liang X.H. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51469-51478Google Scholar), suggesting that Lsm proteins should exist in T. brucei. To identify such proteins, we screened the T. brucei genome data base for Sm motif-containing proteins. In addition to the seven canonical Sm proteins (30Palfi Z. Lucke S. Lahm H.W. Lane W.S. Kruft V. Bragado-Nilsson E. Seraphin B. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8967-8972Google Scholar), several additional proteins were revealed that carry the conserved Sm motifs. Seven of these proteins were identified as Lsm proteins. The results, presented in Fig. 1, align these proteins with their eukaryotic homologues. The T. brucei Lsm2p-8p proteins share 48.4, 40, 42.5, 30, 35, 56.5, and 42% similarities with their yeast homologues, respectively. Alignment of the Sm1 and Sm2 motifs of these proteins is presented in Fig. 1B, and the consensus profile derived from these sequences is depicted in panel C. Using this profile, we searched different data bases and were able to selectively identify Lsm but not Sm proteins. Interestingly, there are unique features of this profile when it is compared with the profile recently published for the Sm1 motif of T. brucei Sm proteins (panel C) (30Palfi Z. Lucke S. Lahm H.W. Lane W.S. Kruft V. Bragado-Nilsson E. Seraphin B. Bindereif A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8967-8972Google Scholar). The Lsm Sm motif 1 starts with the sequence VXV; it is longer in the N terminus but shorter at the C terminus; lacking the sequence E, it always carries a leucine at position 15 and an asparagine at position 23 and not MN as in the Sm proteins (Fig. 1C). Although trypanosome Lsm proteins carry the conserved Sm motifs, they possess unique features compared with their counterparts in other organisms. Lsm2p (the homologue to SmD1) is longer at both the N and C termini. The C terminus carries multiple arginines. Interestingly, the SmD1 of T. brucei lacks the RG repeats present in the mammalian homologue. This arginine carries the dimethyl modification, which constitutes an important determinant of the Sm epitope. The Lsm3p is shorter at the N terminus. Also, Lsm6p (SmF homologue) is shorter at both the C and N termini. Several differences exist for Lsm8p. First, the gap between the two Sm motifs is much longer in the trypanosome protein. The sequence in this loop is not conserved among the different trypanosome species. Second, most strikingly, an EST exists for this gene (T. brucei EST accession number gb T26050.1) that lacks the extended sequence between the two motifs, suggesting that this long loop may be removed by splicing. Surprisingly, the intron removed from this cDNA is not flanked by canonical cis-splicing signals (see “Discussion”). Despite these interesting changes, the trypanosome Lsm proteins carry characteristic features specific to individual Lsm proteins. For example, the N terminus of Lsm4p is rich in hydrophobic amino acids, whereas the C terminus is more hydrophilic. This feature also exists in trypanosome Lsm4p protein. In yeast and humans, the gap between the two Sm motifs in Lsm5p and Lsm6p is composed of hydrophilic sequences. The trypanosome counterparts also have such characteristics. This information suggests that the trypanosome Lsm proteins do contain the conserved Lsm motifs and domain features that specify the different Lsm proteins in other organisms. Lsm3 and Lsm8 Are Essential for Cell Growth—To characterize the role of Lsm proteins, we chose Lsm3p and Lsm8p for functional analysis. We were especially interested in examining the function of Lsm8p, which possesses interesting characteristics described previously. The expression of Lsm proteins was silenced by the two approaches. The Lsm8 was silenced by producing dsRNA in the form of a stem-loop structure, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (35Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Google Scholar, 37Shi H. Djikeng A. Mark T. Wirtz E. Tschudi C. Ullu E. RNA. 2000; 6: 1069-1076Google Scholar). For silencing the Lsm3 gene, PCR was used to amplify the gene that was clone"
https://openalex.org/W2132740087,"A fundamental question in biology is how the various motifs in G protein-coupled receptors participate in the divergent functions orchestrated by these molecules. Here we describe a fundamental role for a serine residue at position 312 in the third intracellular loop of the human β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) in endocytic recycling of the agonist-internalized receptor. In receptor recycling experiments that were monitored by confocal microscopy, the agonist-internalized wild-type (WT) β1-AR recycled with a t0.5 of 14 ± 3 min. Mutagenesis of Ser312 to alanine (Ser312 → Ala β1-AR) or to the phosphoserine mimic aspartic acid (Ser312 → Asp β1-AR) resulted in β1-AR constructs that were pharmacologically indistinguishable from the WT β1-AR. The internalized Ser312 → Asp β1-AR recycled efficiently with a t0.5 of 11 ± 3 min, whereas the internalized Ser312 → Ala β1-AR was not recycled or functionally resensitized through the endosomal pathway. Because this serine is a putative residue for phosphorylation by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), we examined the role of this kinase in recycling of the internalized β1-AR. Inhibition of PKA biochemically or genetically using a dominant negative PKA construct blocked the recycling of the internalized WT β1-AR. Phosphorylation studies revealed that the β1-AR is partially phosphorylated by PKA and that phosphorylation of the β1-AR by the catalytic subunit of PKA occurs exclusively at Ser312. Our results identify a new signaling paradigm in which homologous activation of a kinase provides a reversible modification that shifts the itinerary of the internalized receptor toward recycling and resensitization. Therefore, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptors might result in motif-dependent desensitization or resensitization.

Activation of the β1-AR and other GPCR in turn causes marked changes in the receptor protein and its associated signaling components (reviewed in Ref. 3Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the case of GPCR, the activated receptor becomes a substrate for modification by specific kinases that serve to uncouple the receptor from the G protein (4Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). One such example is homologous desensitization of the β2-AR by β-agonists, whereby ligand-dependent phosphorylation of the β2-AR by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) is rapidly followed by receptor interaction with cytoplasmic β-arrestins that disrupt the interaction between the receptor and the G protein (5Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Calapierto A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar).

The results of many studies indicate that the itinerary of the internalized GPCR is receptor- and cell-specific (13Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol.

For example, in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, the μ-opioid receptor is internalized and then recycled, whereas the internalized ∂-opioid receptor is significantly degraded (14Chu P.

Cell-specific outcomes have been encountered with the β2-AR, which is recycled in HEK-293 cells but degraded in A-431 cells (17Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms or the motifs within the GPCR that are involved in its various outcomes. The carboxyl-terminal tails of the β1-AR and the β2-AR have distinct PDZ-like domains. The PDZ-like domain of the β1-AR interacts with PSD-95 (postsynaptic associated protein 90) and membrane-associated guanylate-inverted-2 (24Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 410: 286-290Crossref Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The motifs involved in regulating the recycling of the β1-AR are more obscure. Our results demonstrate that a critical serine in the third intracellular loop of the human β1-AR that is a substrate for reversible phosphorylation by PKA is involved in recycling and functional resensitization of the human β1-AR. Measurement of β1-AR Cell Surface Expression by Radioligand Binding Assays—Membranous β1-AR expression in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type or the Ser312 point mutants was evaluated with 125I-cyanopindolol binding studies performed at 20 °C for 2 h. Cell lines expressing equivalent amounts of β1-AR were used in these studies. The densities of the β1-AR in these cell lines were 0.95 ± 0.12 pmol of WT β1-AR/mg, 1.1 ± 0.2 pmol of Ser312 → Ala β1-AR/mg, and 0.85 ± 0.1 pmol of Ser312 → Asp β1-AR/mg of protein. The affinity of each receptor to 125I-cyanopindolol was 24 ± 1pm for WT β1-AR, 21 ± 1 pm for the Ser312 → Ala β1-AR, and 27 ± 2 pm for the Ser312 → Asp β1-AR. Cell surface expression and receptor sequestration after exposure of intact cells to agonist (10 μm isoproterenol) were measured with 10 nm [3H]CGP-12177 binding at 13 °C for 3 h (28Staaehelin M.

Determination of β1-AR Surface Expression by Biotinylation—HEK-293 cells expressing the WT β1-AR or the Ser312 → Ala β1-AR were exposed to buffer or to 10 μm isoproterenol for 15 min at 37 °C to induce receptor internalization. Then the medium containing isoproterenol was replaced with warm culture medium containing a 100 μm concentration of the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist alprenolol to block further internalization in order to compare unambiguously the effect of mutagenesis of Ser312 to Ala on recycling. After 3 h at 37 °C, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were surface-biotinylated with 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in Hanks' balanced salt solution with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (HBSS) at 4 °C (30Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The unreacted biotin was quenched with ice-cold 50 mm glycine in HBSS, and the cells were scraped into cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, plus phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1 mm NH4MoO3) and protease inhibitors (10 units/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine plus 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, pepstatin, antipain, and leupeptin)). The homogenate was sonicated and then centrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 20 min at 2 °C. The membrane pellet was dissolved in lysis buffer (precipitation buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100) and recentrifuged at 100,000 × gav for 20 min at 2 °C. The resulting supernatant was collected, and equal amounts of protein from all samples were mixed with 50 μl of bovine serum albumin-blocked ultralink-neutra avidin beads (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. The resin was collected by centrifugation, washed several times with lysis buffer without SDS, and then extracted with 10 μl/100 μg of input protein of 2× Laemmli sample buffer with 20 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 40 min. The supernatant was subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-containing 4–12% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the anti-FLAG antibody. The density of the Mr 73,000 β1-AR monomer from each condition was quantified using a Chemi DOC XRS densitometer (Bio-Rad) equipped with Quantity One software. Biotinylation Assay of β1-AR Recycling with Cleavable Biotin—β1-AR recycling was measured by the loss of internalized β1-AR prelabeled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. In this assay, cells expressing the WT β1-AR or the Ser312 → Ala β1-AR were pretreated with 100 μg/ml of the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin, beginning 1 h prior to biotinylation. The cells were biotinylated on ice for 20 min, and the excess biotin was quenched with glycine. Biotinylated cells were exposed to isoproterenol for 30 min and then cooled to 4 °C to stop membrane trafficking, and the remaining surface biotin was quantitatively cleaved with glutathione cleavage buffer (50 mm glutathione in 75 mm NaCl and 10 mm EDTA containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.075 n NaOH) twice for 15 min at 4 °C. Cultures were then returned to the culture medium at 37 °C for 1, 12, and 24 h to allow internalized receptor to recycle before the cells were cooled to 4 °C and incubated with glutathione cleavage buffer (twice for 15 min at 4 °C) to ensure complete cleavage of any newly appearing surface biotin. Residual biotinylated (internalized) receptors were then isolated from cell lysates as described above. Adenylyl Cyclase Assays for β-AR Desensitization and Resensitization—HEK 293 cells stably expressing the WT β1-AR, Ser312 → Ala β1-AR, and Ser312 → Asp β1-AR were incubated for 1 h in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES prior to assay. Four identical sets of cells were set up; the first set was used as a control for desensitization, and the second set was used for resensitization assays. Cells for desensitization were exposed to 1 mm ascorbic acid (control) or 10 μm isoproterenol for 10 min at 37 °C and then washed with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and processed for the preparation of membranes as described below. The third set was used as the control for resensitization, and the fourth set was used for resensitization assays. Cells for resensitization were exposed either to 1 mm ascorbic acid (control) or to 10 μm isoproterenol for3hat37 °C and then washed with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES. The cells were then incubated with 100 μm alprenolol for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 10 mm HEPES. Membranes were prepared from all cells by hypotonic lysis of the cells with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol supplemented with 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin for 10 min on ice. The cells were transferred into a glass-glass homogenizer and lysed by 30 up-and-down strokes. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 2,500 × gav for 5 min to pellet the nuclei, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × gav for 20 min to pellet the membranes. Then 50 μg of membrane proteins were incubated at 30 °C in a final volume of 0.1 ml containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 1 mm cyclic AMP, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.4 mm EGTA, 2 mg/ml creatine kinase, 0.2 mm ATP containing 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, 1 mm GTP, and the various concentrations of isoproterenol. The assay was initiated by the addition of membranes and terminated after 10 min (31Bahouth S.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cyclic AMP that formed was isolated by column chromatography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting (31Bahouth S.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate and replicated n = 4 times. The Kact ± S.E. for each β1-AR was calculated using the Graphpad Prism 4 program and statistical comparisons were analyzed using Graphpad Instat program. Confocal Microscopy—HEK-293 cells stably transfected with FLAG-tagged WT β1-AR or its Ser312 mutants were grown on poly-l-lysine-covered glass coverslips and serum-starved at 37 °C for 1 h in DMEM supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The receptors were labeled with the M2 anti-FLAG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (0.5 μg/ml) for 1 h. Cells were treated with 10 μm isoproterenol for 30 min, followed by an acid wash with (0.2 m NaCl, 0.5 m acetic acid) to strip off the excess of antibodies. Then 100 μm alprenolol was added, and the coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 10 min at room temperature at different time points to establish the recycle time. In those experiments where the slides were fixed after 1 h from the removal of isoproterenol, the slides were pretreated with 100 μg/ml of the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin for 1 h in serum-free medium. In another series of experiments, a 1 μm concentration of the specific PKA inhibitor H-89 (32Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 1 μm concentration of the myristoylated PKA peptide inhibitor (PKI), TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD (33Walsh D.A. Glass D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 304-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), that inhibits phosphorylation of target proteins by binding to the protein-substrate site of the catalytic subunit of PKA were added to cells prior to isoproterenol. Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed using Zeiss Axiovert LSM 510 (100 × 1.4 DIC oil immersion objective). Fluorescein isothiocyanate was excited with the 488-nm argon-krypton laser and imaged through the 520-nm long-pass emission filter. Z-stacks of images were exported as TIFF files, and individual sections were analyzed with Zeiss LSM 510 and NIH Image 1.6 software. A minimum of 10 images/panel was quantified. Confocal images were analyzed using the same threshold setting. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Generation of HEK-293 Cells Expressing Dominant Negative PKA— Two dominant negative PKA vectors, MT-REVAB and MT-REVAB-neo, were used in our studies (34Rogers K.V. Goldman P.S. Frizzell R.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8975-8979Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In both vectors, the metallothionine gene promoter drives the expression of a PKA RIα subunit mutant in which the two cyclic AMP-binding sites were mutagenized. MT-REVAB was used for transient expression, whereas MT-REVAB-neo was used to generate a stable construct in HEK-293 cells. The metallothionine promoter is induced by Zn2+ ions and inhibited in the absence of Zn2+. The activity of PKA in these cells was determined by an in vitro kinase assay in which cyclic AMP-mediated phosphorylation of biotinylated Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) was used to assess PKA activity (SignaTECT for PKA from Promega Corp.). An MT-REVAB-neo-expressing cell line was selected in which basal PKA activity was undetectable and cyclic AMP-mediated induction of the activity of PKA was 1.8 ± 0.3-fold compared with about 20 ± 4-fold in the cell line expressing the empty MT-neo vector. The HEK-293 cells stably expressing the MT-REVAB-neo were grown on coverslips and transiently transfected with the WT β1-AR for 2 days. The cells were then cultured with MEM supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 1 μm ZnSO4 overnight to induce MT-REVAB-neo expression or in the absence of zinc to repress MT-REVAB-neo expression. Slides were processed for the recycling assay by confocal microscopy as described earlier. Intact and in Vitro Cell Phosphorylation and MAPK Activity Assays—Intact cell phosphorylation of HEK-293 cells expressing the WT β1-AR were performed at 37 °C in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The medium was supplemented with 350 μCi of 32Pi/ml (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h with either 0.03% Me2SO or 1 μm H-89. Stimulation with 10 μm isoproterenol or with 20 μm forskolin were for 10 min, followed by the addition of RIPA extraction buffer composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Equivalent amounts of dissolved proteins were incubated with M2-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. For in vitro cell phosphorylation, 50 μg of membrane protein from HEK-293 cells stably expressing the WT β1-AR or the Ser312 → Ala β1-AR were incubated in 200 μl of PKA kinase buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2,5mm EGTA, 2 mg/ml sodium fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. At the beginning of the experiment, the buffer was supplemented with 1 nm ATP and 0.3 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP. To some samples, ascorbic acid or 10 μm isoproterenol without or with 20 units of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Promega) were added and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation, the tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The membrane pellets were dissolved in RIPA extraction buffer (35Bahouth S.W. Gokmen-Polar Y. Coronel E. Fain J.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 1049-1057PubMed Google Scholar), and the cleared supernatant was collected. Equal amounts of proteins were mixed with 50 μl of anti-M2-FLAG antibody coupled to agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the resins were washed in RIPA buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gels. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography and analyzed quantitatively with Packard Instantimager software. HEK-293 cells were exposed to 50 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 24 h. Pertussis toxin-treated and untreated cells were grown in serum-free DMEM for 2 h and then exposed to 10 μm isoproterenol for 5 min. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in MAPK lysis buffer composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 0.75 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–12% gels, electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 P42/44 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology). The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-P42/44 MAPK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) to ascertain that equal amounts of protein were loaded onto the gels. Human WT β1-AR expressed in HEK 293 cells that were exposed to isoproterenol for 30 min followed by agonist washout, exhibited rapid internalization and recycling (Fig. 1A). These data are consistent with the effect of isoproterenol on β2-adrenergic receptors in this cell line (6von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, mutagenesis of the serine residue at position 312 in the third intracellular loop to alanine (Ser312 → Ala β1-AR) prevented the recycling of the agonist-internalized receptor as determined by radioligand binding (Fig. 1A). Surface biotinylation of cells after 3 h from the removal of isoproterenol showed that the incorporation of biotin into the Ser312 → Ala β1-AR was less than the WT β1-AR (Fig. 1B). Functional assays were used to determine whether this mutation affected the coupling of the WT β1-AR or the Ser312 → Ala β1-AR to adenylyl cyclase in response to isoproterenol (Fig. 1C). Expression of the β1-AR did not markedly increase basal activity of adenylyl cyclase when compared with its activity in cells expressing the empty expression pCDNA vector. Increasing concentrations of isoproterenol increased the activities of adenylyl cyclase by ∼7-fold in each β1-AR-expressing cell line with comparable coupling affinities (Fig. 1C) (36Rapacciuolo A. Suvarna S. Barki-Harrington L. Luttrell L.M. Cong M. Lefkowitz R.J. Rockman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35403-35411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of Ser312 in the trafficking of the β1-AR, we visualized membrane trafficking of antibody-labeled receptors using confocal microscopy. Both the WT β1-AR and Ser312 → Ala β1-AR underwent rapid endocytosis following their activation by isoproterenol, as indexed by the translocation of antibody labeled β1-AR from the plasma membrane to endocytic vesicles (Fig. 2, b and j). Acid treatment of these cells removed the surface-exposed antibody and revealed that intracellular β1-AR staining was in discrete punctate vesicular structures (Fig. 2, c and k). In a confocal recycling assay, involving initial exposure of the cells to isoproterenol, followed by an acid wash and then the addition of the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist alprenolol to prevent further β1-AR internalization, it was revealed that the WT β1-AR recycled rapidly and completely (Fig. 2A, d–g). The t0.5 for recycling of the WT β1-AR was 14 ± 3 min (Fig. 2B). Under the same experimental conditions, the agonist-internalized Ser312 → Ala β1-AR did not recycle even after 24 h (Fig. 1A, l–p). The recycling rate of the phosphoserine mimic generated by substituting an aspartic acid for Ser (Ser312 → Asp β1-AR) was comparable with that of the WT β1-AR with a t0.5 of 11 ± 3 min (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the recycled WT β1-AR is reinserted into membranes and to verify the microscopy results in Fig. 2A, a biochemical recycling assay was performed (Fig. 3A). In this assay, cells expressing the WT β1-AR or the Ser312 → Ala β1-AR were surface-biotinylated with cleavable biotin and then exposed to isoproterenol or buffer for 30 min, followed by cleavage of the remaining cell surface biotin. The first cleavage step permits the analysis of the recycling kinetics of internalized biotinylated receptors without interference from de novo synthesized nonbiotinylated receptors. The data reveal complete cleavage of cell surface biotin from cells exposed to buffer only (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 3A). Exposure of the biotinylated cells to isoproterenol protected a significant amount of internal biotin from cleavage (compare lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 3A). The biotinylated fraction of WT β1-AR that was resistant to cleavage in lane 4 was less than the comparable fraction of Ser312 → Ala β1-AR because some WT β1-AR apparently recycled during the period when isoproterenol was present. After the first cleavage, the cells were returned to 37 °C to allow the WT β1-AR and the Ser312 → Ala β1-AR to recycle for 1, 12, or 24 h. After each time period, the cells were cooled to 4 °C and cleaved for the second time to ensure cleavage of any newly appearing surface biotin. The data reveal that by 1 h, no biotin was detected in the WT β1-AR blots, reflecting membrane recycling of the WT β1-AR and subsequent biotin cleavage (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–7). In contrast, the internalized (biotinylated) Ser312 → Ala β1-AR was not changed after 1, 12, or 24 h from the addition of isoproterenol, reflecting their internal distribution (compare lanes"
https://openalex.org/W2068546264,"LNX was originally cloned as a Numb PTB-binding molecule, and it was subsequently found to act as a RING finger-type E3 ubiquitin ligase for the ubiquitylation and degradation of mNumb. Numb is a PTB domain-containing protein that functions as an intrinsic determinant of cell fate in asymmetric cell division. In mammals, four protein isoforms arise from alternative mRNA splicing. Here we report that while all four protein isoforms bind to LNX, only p72 and p66 Numb isoforms are ubiquitylated and degraded. The p72 and p66 Numb proteins differ from the other two isoforms by the presence of an 11-amino acid sequence insert in the PTB domain (PTBi). We demonstrate that the isoform-specific ubiquitylation of mNumb is due to a novel interaction between the first PDZ domain (PDZ1) of LNX and the PTBi variant. Deletion of LNX PDZ1 domain resulted in loss of ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of the PTBi form of Numb. Interestingly efficient PTBi ubiquitylation not only depends on association with the LNX PDZ1 domain but also requires binding to the canonical PTB-binding motif NPAY in LNX. Thus two distinct modes of PTBi-mediated interaction with LNX work in concert to allow the effective and specific degradation of the p72 and p66 isoforms of mNumb.

Controlled protein degradation mediated by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis underlies the regulation of many critical biological events during the life and death of a cell as well as in health and disease (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 82: 373-428Crossref Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation of a target protein is achieved through a cascade involving at least three enzymes, namely E1, 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; SH, Src homology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. E2, and E3, which activate and transfer ubiquitin to the substrate in a sequential manner. Polyubiquitylated proteins are recognized by the 26 S proteasome and are subsequently degraded into small peptides (2Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

E3 ubiquitin ligases are responsible for the specific recognition of a multitude of substrates. Two major classes of E3 have been identified to date characterized by the presence of either a HECT (homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain or a RING finger domain. HECT-type E3s catalyze ubiquitylation of a substrate by first forming an E3-ubiquitin thioester intermediate followed by the direct transfer of ubiquitin onto the substrate. On the other hand, RING-type E3s function as scaffolds that bring together the E2 and the target substrate to facilitate efficient transfer of the activated ubiquitin moiety from the E2 to the substrate protein (4Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). In addition to HECT or RING finger domains, E3 ligases also contain protein interaction modules for substrate recognition. Diversity in the repertoire of E3 substrate selection is achieved by linking a variety of protein interaction modules to the HECT or RING domains. For example, many HECT domain-containing E3s share the WW domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and has a role in targeting substrates containing a PY motif for ubiquitylation (5Rotin D. Staub O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 176: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The RING-type E3 family is composed of two distinct groups, single and multisubunit proteins. Single subunit E3s such as c-Cbl contain the substrate recognition element and the RING finger on the same polypeptide (3Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The ability of c-Cbl to recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor protein-tyrosine kinases requires its amino-terminal variant SH2 domain (7Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.-C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Multisubunit E3s are composed of a complex of proteins including a small RING finger protein and a member of the CULIN family of proteins in addition to other subunits important for functions such as substrate recognition. Among the multisubunit E3s are the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome involved in degradation of cell cycle regulators (8Page A.M. Hiete P. Annu. Rev. Bioch. 1999; 68: 583-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), the von Hippel-Lindau-Elongins B and C-Cul2-RING finger complex involved in the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (10Iwai K. Yamanaka K. Kamura T. Minato N. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Klausner R.D. Pause A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12436-12441Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and the Skp1-Cullin/Cdc53-F-box protein-RING finger complexes involved in degradation of signal- and cell cycle-induced phosphorylated proteins (9Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Given the importance of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in cellular regulation, high selectivity and specificity of substrate recognition is required. Several distinct modes of substrate recognition by E3 ubiquitin ligases have been described. First, E3s can recognize substrates via their amino-terminal residue known as the N-end rule pathway (11Varshavsky A. Turner G. Du F. Xie Y. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Second, the binding specificity of protein interaction modules, such as WW domains found in the Nedd4 family of E3s, can dictate substrate selection (12Kanelis V. Rotin D. Forman-Kay J.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, substrate phosphorylation can serve as a regulator of E3 recognition and activity. For instance, substrate recognition by F-box proteins in Skp1-Cullin/Cdc53-F-box protein complexes is regulated by serine and threonine phosphorylation (13Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Similarly tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the interaction of receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase substrates with c-Cbl through its variant SH2 domain (14Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl itself has been proposed to promote its ligase activity. LNX is a RING finger-containing E3 ligase first identified as a binding partner for Numb, an adaptor protein implicated in the control of cell fate decisions during development (15Dho S.E. Jacob S. Wolting C.D. French M.B. Rohrschneider L.R. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9179-9187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Nie J. McGill M.A. Dermer M. Dho S.E. Wolting C.D. McGlade C.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). LNX also contains four PDZ domains and interacts directly with the PTB domain of mNumb via the PTB domain-binding motif NPAY (15Dho S.E. Jacob S. Wolting C.D. French M.B. Rohrschneider L.R. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9179-9187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Numb is an LNX substrate and that Numb binding to LNX promotes its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. A highly related protein called LNX2 has also been characterized (17Rice D.S. Northcutt G.M. Kurschner C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 525-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that is capable of binding to the PTB domain of mNumb, although its potential function as an E3 ligase was not tested. In addition to mNumb, the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor was identified as an LNX binding partner (18Sollerbrant K. Raschperger E. Mirza M. Engstrom U. Philipson L. Ljungdahl P.O. Pettersson R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7439-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The association with coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor is mediated by the second PDZ domain of LNX binding to the cytoplasmic tail of receptor. Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, therefore, may represent a second LNX substrate, although this has not been reported. While only one form of Numb has been identified in Drosophila, mammals express four alternative spliced isoforms with predicted molecular masses of 65, 66, 71, and 72 kDa. The four Numb protein isoforms differ by the inclusion of two inserts, one of 11 amino acids within the PTB domain and the other of 49 amino acids within the central proline-rich region of the protein. Previously we characterized LNX activity against the p72 Numb isoform that includes both sequence inserts. Since all four isoforms of Numb bind to LNX in vitro, we predicted that all would be susceptible to LNX-mediated ubiquitylation and degradation. However, here we report that only the p72 and p66 Numb isoforms containing the 11-amino acid insert in the PTB domain are ubiquitylated and degraded by LNX. In addition, we show that this selectivity in substrate recognition by LNX requires the first PDZ domain, which mediates a PDZ-PTB domain interaction specific to the variant form of the Numb PTB domain found in p72 and p66. Plasmids Constructs and Mutagenesis—Wild-type and truncation mutant LNX constructs have been described previously (15Dho S.E. Jacob S. Wolting C.D. French M.B. Rohrschneider L.R. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9179-9187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Nie J. McGill M.A. Dermer M. Dho S.E. Wolting C.D. McGlade C.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). LNX ΔPDZ1 was constructed by ligation of two PCR-generated cDNA fragments containing nucleotides 1–984 and 1296–2372 and subcloning into either pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences) or FLAG-CMV2 mammalian expression vector (Sigma). His-tagged PDZ1 of LNX was generated by PCR encoding amino acids 216–446 and then subcloned into pET28a (+) vector (Novagen). GST fusion proteins were constructed by subcloning PCR products into pGEX-4T-3 vectors (Amersham Bioscience). GST-PDZ1 of LNX encodes amino acids 216–446. GST-PDZ2 of LNX encodes amino acids 365–478. GST-PDZ3 of LNX encodes amino acids 495–606. GST fusion protein of the third PDZ domain of PSD95 encodes amino acids 320–427. The cDNAs for the Numb isoforms were subcloned into either pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma). Point mutations were introduced into the Numb using PCR-based mutagenesis. pcDNA-Numb PTBi or PTBo or pFLAG-Numb PTBi or PTBo were generated by PCR and encode amino acids 1–246 and 1–235, respectively. GST-PTBi and GST-PTBo have been described previously (15Dho S.E. Jacob S. Wolting C.D. French M.B. Rohrschneider L.R. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9179-9187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All cDNA expression constructs and mutations generated by PCR were verified by sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Wisent) plus 10% fetal bovine serum. DNA constructs (1–2 μg) were transfected into 293T cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—[35S]Methionine-labeled Numb was synthesized by in vitro transcription-translation in wheat germ lysates using the TnT kit (Promega). Aliquots (5 μl) of in vitro translated proteins were added into each in vitro ubiquitylation reaction as described previously (16Nie J. McGill M.A. Dermer M. Dho S.E. Wolting C.D. McGlade C.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly in vitro ubiquitylation assays were carried out using 0.6–1.0 μg of purified GST-LNX fusion proteins, 2 μl of E2-containing lysate, 500 mm E1 from yeast (Affinity UW 8545), 2 mm ATP, 5 μm ubiquitin (Sigma), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 90 min and stopped by adding 2× SDS sample buffer. The E2 used was prepared from Escherichia coli BL21 transformed with histidine-tagged Ubc5B DNA in pT7-7 following induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside. The bacteria were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus protease inhibitors, and the clarified supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), which was then washed three times with PBS and was aliquoted and stored at –20 °C. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (∼1–3 mg of protein) were incubated with appropriate antibody and HNTG-ZE lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm ZnCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) at 4 °C for 2–4 h. The immune complex was bound to protein A-Sepharose beads, washed three times with cold HNTG-ZE, and eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For immunoblotting experiments, 50-μg samples of total cellular lysate in SDS loading buffer were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Anti-Numb and anti-LNX antibody polyclonal antisera were generated and affinity-purified as described previously (15Dho S.E. Jacob S. Wolting C.D. French M.B. Rohrschneider L.R. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9179-9187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Dho S.E. French M.B. Woods S.A. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33097-33104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and anti-tubulin (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were purchased. In Vitro Binding Assays—Numb PTBi and PTBo expression constructs were individually transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine using wheat germ lysates (TnT kit, Promega). pGEX-LNX constructs were expressed in the BL21 strain of E. coli. Expression of the GST fusion protein was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-β-d-thio-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 2–4 h. The bacterial pellets were sonicated in PBS plus protease inhibitors. The cleared bacterial lysates were incubated for overnight at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), which were then washed four times with PBS. For the in vitro binding assay, radiolabeled Numb PTBi or PTBo was incubated with purified GST fusion LNX proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C in PBS with mixing. Following the incubation, the glutathione-Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times in PBS. After washing, pelleted beads were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS sample loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. Denatured proteins released into the supernatant were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Fluorescence Polarization Measurements—The PDZ1 domain tagged with His6 was expressed in bacteria and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Fluorescein labeling and polarization measurements were performed as described previously (37Li C. Iosef C. Jia C.Y.H. Han V.K.M. Li S.S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3852-3859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding isotherms were obtained by titrating a fixed concentration of fluorescent PDZ1 with an increasing amount of purified PTBi or PTBo protein (as GST fusions). The curves were fit by non-linear regression using Prism curve-fitting software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), which also gave the corresponding dissociation constant (Kd) values. GST alone did not show appreciable binding under the same conditions. LNX Promotes Numb p72 and p66 Ubiquitylation and Degradation—We have previously shown that LNX interacts with all four isoforms of mNumb through its PTB domain-binding motif, NPAY (Fig. 1A) (19Dho S.E. French M.B. Woods S.A. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33097-33104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Therefore, LNX could presumably mediate ubiquitylation of all four Numb isoforms through this interaction. To test this hypothesis, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay. Numb p72 was transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and then incubated with recombinant E1, E2 (Ubc5B), and ubiquitin in the presence of GST-LNX fusion protein as E3. The ubiquitinated Numb was shown as a high molecular weight smear (Fig. 1B). To further confirm that the high molecular weight smear is caused by the conjugation of polyubiquitin to Numb, we substituted the untagged ubiquitin (8 kDa) with amino-terminal histidine-tagged ubiquitin, which is 10 kDa, in the in vitro ubiquitination assay. In the presence of His-ubiquitin, the modified Numb proteins were shifted to a higher molecular weight in comparison with that of untagged ubiquitin (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2) indicating that the high molecular weights of Numb proteins detected in this assay are indeed modified by ubiquitin. Moreover, in the absence of either E2, ubiquitin, or GST-LNX, Numb p72 failed to be ubiquitinated in vitro (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5). These results demonstrate that LNX-dependent Numb ubiquitylation can be detected efficiently and specifically in an in vitro ubiquitylation assay. We then used this assay to examine whether all four isoforms of Numb are ubiquitinated by LNX in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1C, only two isoforms of Numb, p72 and p66, containing the 11-amino acid sequence insert in the PTB domain (PTBi), were efficiently ubiquitinated by LNX in vitro. Since LNX-mediated Numb ubiquitylation further promotes its degradation, we then tested whether LNX-mediated Numb degradation is also isoform-specific. Cells were co-transfected with LNX and each of the four isoforms of Numb, and cell lysates were separated and immunoblotted with anti-Numb antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D, the p72 and p66 Numb isoforms were significantly degraded upon co-expression with LNX, whereas levels of the p71 and p65 isoforms remained relatively unaffected (Fig. 1D). To further investigate whether endogenous Numb degradation is isoform-specific, 293T cells were transfected with LNX, and 24 h later endogenous p72 and p66 numb were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an isoform-specific antibody raised against the PTBi insert sequence (19Dho S.E. French M.B. Woods S.A. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33097-33104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1E, a dose-dependent degradation of endogenous PTBi containing isoforms of Numb was observed. In contrast, no appreciable degradation was detected when endogenous Numb was immunoprecipitated with anti-Numb antibody that recognizes all four isoforms (Fig. 1E, lower panel). Numb PTBi Domain Is Sufficient for Ubiquitylation by LNX—Since ubiquitylation of full-length Numb isoforms was dependent on the presence of the insert in the PTB domain, we considered whether the PTBi domain alone is sufficient for ubiquitylation. To address this, two truncation mutants of Numb lacking all amino acids carboxyl-terminal to the PTBi or PTBo domain were generated. The 25 residues at the amino terminus of Numb immediately preceding the PTB domain were retained. The PTBi and PTBo proteins were in vitro translated and used in LNX-dependent ubiquitylation assays. LNX catalyzed ubiquitylation of Numb PTBi but not PTBo in vitro (Fig. 2A). Typically a polyubiquitin chain is linked to the ϵ-amino group of one or more internal lysine residues of a substrate. Since there are three lysine residues present within the 11-amino acid PTB insert (Lys-70, Lys-73, and Lys-78 in p72 Numb), we tested whether one of these lysine residues might be the site of Numb ubiquitination and thus mediates the PTBi-specific ubiquitination event. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute each of the lysine residues within the PTB insert with arginine, and mutant forms of Numb p72 were in vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine. In vitro ubiquitination assays showed that mutation of single lysine residues (K70R, K73R, and K78R) or replacement of all three lysine residues (K70R/K73R/K78R) had no effect on LNX-dependent ubiquitination of p72 in vitro (Fig. 2B). The stability of these Numb mutants was further tested in vivo in cells co-transfected with wild-type LNX. These mutants were degraded as efficiently as wild-type p72 Numb (Fig. 2C). To test the ability of these mutants to bind to LNX, K70R, K73R, K78R, or K70R/K73R/K78R forms of Numb were transiently transfected into 293T cells, and total lysates were incubated with the immobilized GST-LNX fusion protein. Proteins that bound to GST-LNX were identified by Western blotting using anti-Numb antibody. As shown on Fig. 2D, all of the Numb mutants still bound to GST-LNX. Together these data suggest that the three lysine residues within the PTB insert are not sites of ubiquitination that direct the PTBi-specific ubiquitination of Numb. Moreover mutation of these three lysines to arginine did not affect the binding of Numb to LNX. LNX PDZ1 Domain Specifically Interacts with mNumb PTBi—Since the lysine residues specific to the PTBi domain did not appear to be the basis for isoform-specific ubiquitination, we examined the interaction of PTBi and PTBo domains with LNX. We have previously shown that LNX contains a canonical PTB domain-binding motif, NPAY, located between the RING finger domain and the first PDZ domain (15Dho S.E. Jacob S. Wolting C.D. French M.B. Rohrschneider L.R. McGlade C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9179-9187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This PTB-binding motif was required for the Numb-LNX association and for Numb ubiquitination; however, the first PDZ domain of LNX (PDZ1) was also required for Numb p72 ubiquitination both in vitro and in vivo (16Nie J. McGill M.A. Dermer M. Dho S.E. Wolting C.D. McGlade C.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To further define the role of LNX PDZ1 in substrate recognition, we examined whether LNX PDZ1 interacts specifically with the Numb PTB domain. The PTBi and PTBo truncated mutants were labeled with [35S]methionine by in vitro translation and incubated with purified GST-PDZ1. GST-PDZ1 bound to PTBi, and the binding was enhanced with increasing input of GST-PDZ1 fusion protein (Fig. 3A). In contrast, only weak binding to the PTBo domain was observed. To further confirm this interaction, we expressed FLAG-tagged PTBi and PTBo in HEK293T cells and incubated transfected cell lysates with purified GST-PDZ1 protein. GST-PDZ1 bound FLAG-tagged PTBi but not PTBo (Fig. 3B), indicating that the LNX PDZ1 domain interacts specifically with the PTBi isoform. To explore whether this interaction is specific for the PDZ1 domain, we generated GST fusion proteins of isolated PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains and incubated them with PTBi-containing 293T cell lysates. GST-PDZ4 was not tested because a stable GST fusion protein could not be produced. Only LNX PDZ1, but not PDZ2, PDZ3, or GST alone, bound to the Numb PTBi domain (Fig. 3C). Based on the primary amino acid sequence of LNX PDZ1, it most closely resembles those of class I PDZ domains (20Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). To test whether another member of the same class of PDZ domains could interact with Numb PTBi, we used a GST fusion of the third PDZ domain of PSD-95, which is most similar to LNX PDZ1. No detectable amount of FLAG-tagged PTBi bound the PSD-95 PDZ domain (Fig. 3C). Collectively these data suggest that the first PDZ domain of LNX binds specifically and directly to Numb PTBi. To ascertain whether the PDZ-PTBi interaction can occur in the context of full-length Numb, we overexpressed all four isoforms of Numb (FLAG-tagged) in 293T cells and performed pull-down assays using GST-LNX PDZ1. GST-PDZ1 preferentially associated with the p72 and p66 Numb isoforms that contain the PTBi variant (Fig. 3D). The much weaker binding of PDZ1 to full-length p65 and p71 may represent nonspecific binding or the presence of a cross-reacting protein. These results lend additional support to the notion that LNX PDZ1 domain associates specifically with Numb PTBi domain and that this association directly contributes to the isoform-specific ubiquitylation of Numb. To gain a quantitative measure of the interaction between LNX and the Numb PTBi and PTBo variants, we synthesized a peptide corresponding to the NPAY site in LNX and labeled it with fluorescein. Binding of PTBi and PTBo (as GST fusion) to the peptide was measured using fluorescence polarization. As shown in Fig. 4A, both variants were capable of binding to the NPAY peptide with corresponding dissociation constants (Kd) of 7.4 μm for the PTBo and 5.9 μm for the PTBi domain. Interestingly these Kd values are significantly greater than that obtained for the Drosophila PTB domain binding to similar peptide, which measured 2.4 μm (data not shown). The contribution of the LNX PDZ1 domain to Numb binding was analyzed using bacterial expressed, purified, and fluorescein-labeled PDZ1. Titration of the PTBi domain protein into fluorescein-PDZ1 produced a saturable binding curve indicative of specific binding between the two proteins (Fig. 4). The corresponding Kd value for this interaction was estimated to be 12.5 μm. In contrast, the PTBo protein exhibited significantly weaker binding (Kd > 50 μm) under the same conditions (Fig. 4). Collectively these data suggest that while both PTB variants can bind to the NPAY site, only the PTBi domain interacts specifically with the PDZ1 domain of LNX. Substitution of Lysine Residues within the 11-amino Acid Insert to Alanine Reduced Binding of PTBi Domain to LNX PDZ1—Because the only difference between the PTBi and PTBo variant is an 11-amino acid insert, it seems reasonable to assume that residues within this insert contribute to the preferential binding of PTBi to PDZ1. To explore this possibility, each of the 11 residues, with the exception of the two glycines (Gly-74 and Gly-77), which are not expected to directly participate in specific protein-protein interactions due to the lack of a side chain, was substituted for alanine. These PTBi mutants were subsequently expressed in 293T cells and subjected to pull-down experiments by GST-PDZ1. The PTBi mutants K70A, K73A, and K78A, exhibited significantly reduced binding to the PDZ1 protein compared with wild-type PTBi, suggesting that these residues play important roles in the Numb PTBi-LNX PDZ1 interaction (Fig. 5A). This assertion was confirmed using PTBi mutants bearing double Lys to Ala substitutions. The binding of the double mutants K70A/K78A and K73A/K78A to PTBi were significantly decreased, whereas that of mutant K70A/K73A was completely abolished (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that residues Lys-78, Lys-73, and Lys-70 in the PTB insert are important for binding to PDZ1 of LNX. This association may require the presence of several positively charged residues rather than a linear sequence motif since the PTBi domain mutants containing Arg substitutions at these positions still effectively bound LNX and were ubiquitinated as shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore a peptide corresponding to the PTBi sequence was unable to compete for PDZ1 binding (data not shown) indicating that PTBi-PDZ1 binding involves the intact PTBi domain rather than recognition of the insert peptide sequence by PDZ1. Since mutation of K70A/K73A severely attenuated the binding of Numb PTBi to LNX PDZ1 we tested whether this mut"
https://openalex.org/W2020589005,"G protein-coupled receptors form the largest family of membrane receptors and transmit diverse ligand signals to modulate various cellular responses. After activation by their ligands, some of these G protein-coupled receptors are desensitized, internalized (endocytosed), and down-regulated (degraded). In HEK 293 cells, the Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor was postulated to initiate a second wave of signaling, such as the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway after the receptor is internalized. The tyrosine kinase c-Src plays a critical role in these events. Here we used mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells deficient in Src family tyrosine kinases to examine the role of Src in β2-adrenergic receptor signaling to the MAPK pathway and in receptor internalization. We found that in Src-deficient cells the β2-adrenergic receptor could activate the MAPK pathway. However, the internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors was blocked in Src-deficient MEF cells. Furthermore, we observed that in MEF cells deficient in β-arrestin 2 the internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor was impaired, whereas the activation of the MAPK pathway by the β2-adrenergic receptor was normal. Our data demonstrate that although Src and β-arrestin 2 play essential roles in β2-adrenergic receptor internalization, they are not required for the activation of the MAPK pathway by the β2-adrenergic receptor. In other words, our finding suggests that receptor internalization is not required for β2-adrenergic receptor signaling to the MAPK pathway in MEF cells.

We found that in Src-deficient cells the β2-adrenergic receptor could activate the MAPK pathway. However, the internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors was blocked in Src-deficient MEF cells. Furthermore, we observed that in MEF cells deficient in β-arrestin 2 the internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor was impaired, whereas the activation of the MAPK pathway by the β2-adrenergic receptor was normal. Our data demonstrate that although Src and β-arrestin 2 play essential roles in β2-adrenergic receptor internalization, they are not required for the activation of the MAPK pathway by the β2-adrenergic receptor. In other words, our finding suggests that receptor internalization is not required for β2-adrenergic receptor signaling to the MAPK pathway in MEF cells. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; β2-AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; GFP, green fluorescent protein. mediate transmembrane signaling for a large number of ligands including hormones, neurotransmitters, photons, odorants, pheromones, chemokines, and other stimuli (1Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar, 2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

These receptors relay the signals to heterotrimeric G proteins, which directly modulate the activity of enzymes or other effector molecules. One of the prototypes of GPCRs is the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) that transduces signals from catecholamines, norepinephrine, and epinephrine to the Gs protein, which in turn activates downstream effectors (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). After agonist activation, β2-AR is phosphorylated by GPCR kinases with the subsequent binding of β-arrestin 2 to the phosphorylated β2-AR leading to the internalization (endocytosis) through clathrin-coated pits (4Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). GPCRs can relay ligand signals to various cellular signaling pathways. One of these cellular pathways is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (6Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The MAPK cascade, an evolutionarily conserved signaling module, stimulates numerous physiological responses including cell growth and differentiation (7Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). The pathway consists of a MAP kinase kinase kinase that phosphorylates and activates a MAP kinase kinase, which in turn phosphorylates the TXY activation loop of MAP kinase (8Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar). The first characterized subfamily of MAP kinases, termed extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), and is activated by growth factor receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, and other types of receptors. The most common MAPK pathway involves Ras, Raf kinase (a MAP kinase kinase kinase), and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (a MAP kinase kinase) (9Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L. Pearson G. Xu B. Wright A. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). GPCRs seem to activate the ERK MAPK pathway by diverse signaling pathways depending on the receptors and the cell types. Some of these activation pathways from GPCRs to ERK MAPK involve tyrosine kinases (10Chen J. Iyengar R. Science. 1994; 263: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Wan Y. Kurosaki T.

For example, previously we showed that Src family tyrosine kinases are essential for Gq signaling to ERK MAPK in DT40 chicken B lymphoma cells (11Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In other GPCR signaling to ERK MAPK or in other cell types, tyrosine kinases might not be essential. We have shown that in S49 mouse T lymphoma cells, Gs signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway is independent of Src family tyrosine kinases. Instead, a protein kinase A-dependent pathway was used (17Wan Y.

In HEK 293 cells, it was reported that isoproterenol stimulation of β2-AR leading to the activation of ERK MAPK requires Src and receptor internalization (19Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Src family tyrosine kinases are a major group of cellular signal transducers (20Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). c-Src was the first identified protein tyrosine kinase (21Bishop J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 301-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 22Hunter T. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 897-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These tyrosine kinases can be activated by various extracellular signals and modulate a variety of cellular functions including proliferation, survival, adhesion, and migration (20Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). GPCRs have been shown to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (20Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). Various G protein-mediated physiological functions are sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Many GPCRs are able to increase the activity of Src family tyrosine kinases (10Chen J. Iyengar R. Science. 1994; 263: 1278-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Wan Y. Kurosaki T.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1199-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which other G proteins activate Src family tyrosine kinases is not known, we have shown previously that Gαs and Gαi can directly interact with and activate Src (18Gu C. Ma Y.C. Benjamin J. Littman D. Chao M.V. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20726-20733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). During our investigation of the role of tyrosine kinases in G protein signaling, we notice that in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells deficient in Src family tyrosine kinases (SYF cells) a constitutively active mutant of Gαs (GαsQ227L) is able to increase the kinase activity of ERK MAPK. Indeed stimulation of the endogenous Gs-coupled β2-AR also activates ERK MAPK in SYF cells. However, the internalization of β2-AR is blocked in SYF cells. Thus, these observations implicate that receptor internalization might not be necessary for the activation of the ERK MAPK pathway by β2-AR. To confirm this, we used MEF cells deficient in β-arrestin 2 because β-arrestin 2 has been shown to be essential for β2-AR internalization (29Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). We found that although β-arrestin 2 deficiency impairs β2-AR internalization, it does not affect β2-AR signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway. Together, these data demonstrate that Src plays different roles in β2-AR signaling to MAPK and in receptor internalization and that receptor internalization is not required for β2-AR signaling to ERK MAPK in MEF cells. Cell Lines and Plasmid Constructs—The MEF cells deficient in Src family tyrosine kinases (SYF cells) were purchased from ATCC. The SYF/Src cells were established by stably transfecting human c-Src into SYF cells (28Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The MEF cells deficient in either β-arrestin 2 or deficient in β-arrestin 1 and 2 were kindly provided by Dr. R. Lefkowitz (Duke University) (29Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmid cDNAs for human G proteins were purchased from Guthrie Research Institute. The cDNA for the human β2-AR was kindly provided by Dr. C. Malbon (State University of New York at Stony Brook) and subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector. A GFP tag was inserted into the 3′ end of β2-AR. ERK MAPK Assay—The p44/42 MAP kinase assay was performed using kits from Cell Signaling Technology as described previously (11Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared from MEF, SYF, SYF/Src, β-arrestin --/-, or β-arrestin 1-/-2-/- fibroblast cells. Cells were either treated or not with isoproterenol (10 μm) for 5 min. A monoclonal antibody to the phospho-p44/42 ERK MAPK (cross-linked to agarose beads) was added to immunoprecipitate the active ERK MAPK from cell lysates. Substrates (200 μm ATP and 2 μg glutathione S-transferase-Elk-1 fusion protein) were added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 30 min. After SDS-PAGE, the ERK MAPK activity (the phosphorylation of glutathione S-transferase-Elk-1 by ERK MAPK) was measured by Western blotting with an anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Receptor Internalization—Cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid carrying a GFP-tagged human β2-adrenergic receptor (pcDNA3-β2-AR-GFP). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were split onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were treated with or without 10 μm isoproterenol at 37 °C for 30 min, rinsed quickly three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and further incubated in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After being rinsed again three times in phosphate-buffered saline, the coverslips were mounted on a microscope slide with Vecta Shield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) before imaging by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope. Src Family Tyrosine Kinases Are Not Required for GαsQ227L Stimulation of ERK MAPK in MEF Cells—To genetically test the role of Src family tyrosine kinases in Gs signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway, we investigated the stimulation of ERK MAPK by the constitutively active mutant of Gαs (GαsQ227L) in Src family tyrosine kinase knock-out MEF cells. We used the SYF cells that were derived from Src, Yes, and Fyn triple knock-out mouse embryos (30Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Because Src, Yes, and Fyn are the three ubiquitously expressed members of the Src family tyrosine kinases, no Src family tyrosine kinase activity was detected in these SYF cells (30Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). We found that transient expression of GαsQ227L in the control wild-type MEF cells led to increased activity of ERK MAPK (Fig. 1A). In SYF cells, expression of GαsQ227L also increased the ERK MAPK activity to a similar degree (Fig. 1B). These genetic data demonstrated that Src family tyrosine kinases are not required for GαsQ227L signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway. As controls, we also examined the requirement for Src family tyrosine kinases by some other G proteins signaling to ERK MAPK in MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, transient expression of constitutively active mutants of Gα12 (Gα12Q231L), Gα13 (Gα13Q226L), Gαq (GαqQ209L), Gαi2 (Gαi2Q205L), and Gβ1γ2 led to the activation of ERK MAPK to different degrees. Interestingly, in SYF cells, except for Gα13Q226L, the other G protein mutants (Gαi2Q205L, Gα12Q231L, GαqQ209L, and Gβ1γ2) failed to stimulate ERK MAPK (Fig. 1D). These data suggest that Gα13Q226L does not require Src family tyrosine kinases signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway in MEF cells, whereas Gαi2Q205L, Gα12Q231L, GαqQ209L, and Gβ1γ2 require Src family tyrosine kinases for the activation of ERK MAPK in MEF cells. In this work, we focused on the Gs signaling to ERK MAPK. Thus, we did not examine further the Src-dependent signaling by other G proteins to the ERK MAPK pathway in MEF cells. Src Family Tyrosine Kinases Are Not Required for β2-Adrenergic Receptor Stimulation of ERK MAPK in MEF Cells—The above study examined the role of Src family tyrosine kinases in signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway by exogenously expressing constitutively active Gs mutant proteins. Next we examined the requirement of endogenous Gs protein-coupled receptors for Src family tyrosine kinases. We used the β2-adrenergic receptor as a representative for Gs-coupled receptors. Treatment of MEF cells with the β2-AR agonist isoproterenol increased the cAMP levels in MEF and SYF cells, indicating the presence of endogenous β2-adrenergic receptors in these cells (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, treatment of SYF cells with isoproterenol led to an increased activity of ERK MAPK, indicating that Src family tyrosine kinases are not essential for β2-AR signaling to ERK MAPK. Isoproterenol also increased the activity of ERK MAPK in SYF/Src cells (re-expression of Src in SYF cells) (Fig. 2B). Similar results also were observed with another β2-AR agonist, terbutaline (data not shown). This is consistent with the above data that showed that Gαs-mediated activation of ERK MAPK is independent of Src family tyrosine kinases. Hence, the endogenous β2-AR still was able to stimulate ERK MAPK in SYF cells. β-Arrestin 2 Is Required for β2-Adrenerigc Receptor Internalization but Not for β2-Adrenergic Receptor Signaling to ERK MAPK in MEF Cells—It has been reported that β2-AR internalization might initiate a second wave of intracellular signaling, including the activation of the ERK MAPK pathway in HEK 293 cells (19Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). To investigate whether that is the case in MEF cells, we genetically examined the role of β-arrestin proteins in β2-AR stimulation of ERK MAPK. Radioligand binding studies with β-arrestin 2-/-, β-arrestin 1-/-, and β-arrestin 1-/-2-/- MEF cells showed that the internalization of β2-AR in β-arrestin 2-/- cells and β-arrestin 1-/-2-/- cells was significantly impaired (29Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the β2-AR internalization was normal in β-arrestin 1-/-cells (29Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). In the control wild-type MEF cells, transient expression of a C-terminal GFP-tagged β2-AR showed membrane staining as well as cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 3A). Thirty min after the addition of isoproterenol to these cells, an increased level of internalization of these GFP-tagged β2-adrenergic receptors was observed (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, in β-arrestin 2-/- cells, treatment with isoproterenol did not lead to internalization of the GFP-tagged β2-ARs. These results are consistent with the previous report that β-arrestin 2 plays a critical role in β2-AR internalization (29Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, C and D). Next we investigated the potential role of β-arrestin proteins and thus receptor internalization in β2-AR-initiated activation of ERK MAPK. As shown in Fig. 4, addition of isoproterenol to the β-arrestin 1-/-2-/- cells led to increased ERK MAPK activity (same as in the wild-type MEF cells and β-arrestin 2-/- cells) (Fig. 4). Moreover, similar results also were observed with another β2-AR agonist, terbutaline (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that in MEF cells, β-arrestin proteins and thus receptor internalization are not essential for β2-AR signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway. Src Family Tyrosine Kinases Are Required for β2-Adrenergic Receptor Internalization—Because we did not find an essential role for receptor internalization in the activation of the ERK MAPK pathway by β2-AR in MEF cells and because Src has been reported to form a complex with β-arrestin 2, we examined the genetic requirement for Src family tyrosine kinases in β2-AR internalization. In contrast to what was observed in the control wild-type MEF cells (Fig. 3, A and B), isoproterenol did not induce the internalization of the GFP-tagged β2-AR in SYF cells (Fig. 5, A and B). To confirm that this defect in receptor internalization was caused by the absence of Src family tyrosine kinases, we re-introduced Src into SYF cells. Re-expression of Src in these SYF cells rescued the receptor internalization phenotype (Fig. 5, C and D). These data indicate that even though Src family tyrosine kinases are not required for β2-AR signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway they are essential for β2-AR internalization. Therefore, Src family tyrosine kinases play distinct roles in β2-AR signaling to ERK MAPK and in receptor internalization. Role of Src Family Tyrosine Kinases in β2-Adrenergic Receptor Signaling to ERK MAPK—Although prolonged exposure to cAMP leads to the inhibition of ERK MAPK in some types of cells, ligand stimulation of β2-AR is able to transiently stimulate ERK MAPK in most reported cases (17Wan Y.

In S49 mouse lymphoma cells, we previously reported a Gs-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-protein kinase A-dependent pathway leading to ERK MAPK activation (17Wan Y. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14533-14537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This classical Gs-protein kinase A signaling pathway also has been implicated in activating the ERK MAPK pathway through β2-AR stimulation in other cells such as the HEK 293 cells (38Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25342-25350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this Gs signaling pathway via protein kinase A to ERK MAPK also has been reported for other Gs-coupled receptors (36Verheijen M.H. Defize L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3423-3429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 41Jiang Y. Cypess A.M. Muse E.D. Wu C.R. Unson C.G. Merrifield R.B. Sakmar T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10102-10107Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because this pathway is independent of Ras, it is different from the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway. However, there are disagreements on whether Src family tyrosine kinases are involved in β2-AR signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway. In HEK 293 cells, β-arrestin was reported to form a complex with Src and brought Src to the β2-AR, leading to the receptor desensitization/internalization process, which initiates a second wave of signaling including the ERK MAPK pathway (19Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we show here that in MEF cells Src is not essential for β2-AR stimulation of ERK MAPK. Moreover, treatment of HEK 293 cells with Src family kinase inhibitors did not block Gs-coupled A2A-adenosine receptor signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway (42Klinger M. Kudlacek O. Seidel M.G. Freissmuth M. Sexl V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32490-32497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The different roles of Src in β2-AR stimulation of ERK MAPK in these reports might reflect either the different cell types used or the methods used. Interestingly, we noticed that the basal activity of ERK MAPK in SYF cells was consistently higher than in MEF cells and SYF/Src cells (Fig. 2B; also Fig. 1, A-D). This difference in basal activity of ERK MAPK is not caused by a difference in ERK MAPK protein expression levels in MEF and SYF cells. These data imply that the basal ERK MAPK activity in MEF cells was suppressed by c-Src. Inhibition of ERK by activated c-Src was reported recently in fibroblast cells (43Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, because MEF cells were serum-starved, c-Src was likely in the down-regulated (inactive) state. Thus, it seems that the down-regulated c-Src has an unexpected function here. This might be reminiscent of the MAPK Kss1 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Kss1 in its inactive form is a potent negative regulator of invasive growth (44Cook J.G. Bardwell L. Thorner J. Nature. 1997; 390: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 45Madhani H.D. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Cell. 1997; 91: 673-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The nature of this potential negative regulation of basal ERK MAPK by c-Src needs further investigation. Role of Src Family Tyrosine Kinases in β2-Adrenergic Receptor Internalization—For β2-AR internalization, ligand stimulation of β2-AR leads to the activation of G protein-coupled receptor kinases and the phosphorylation of some C-terminal Ser/Thr residues of β2-AR by G protein-coupled receptor kinases. This phosphorylation in turn promotes the association of β2-AR with β-arrestin 2 and subsequent internalization (4Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The essential role of β-arrestin 2 in β2-AR internalization was confirmed in MEF cells from β-arrestin 2 knock-out mice (29Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). β-Arrestins can interact directly with clathrin (46Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar), which could promote receptor internalization through clathrin-coated pits (4Marchese A. Chen C. Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 5Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Following the above β2-AR internalization scheme, it was surprising to see the inhibition of β2-AR internalization in SYF cells. Our data strongly indicate that Src family tyrosine kinases are involved in the β2-AR internalization process. There was some suggestive evidence that Src family tyrosine kinases might act upstream of G protein-coupled receptor kinases in β2-AR internalization. First, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of c-Src, treatment with PP2 inhibitor, and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides in human epidermoid A431 carcinoma cells inhibited ligand-induced β2-AR internalization (47Fan G. Shumay E. Malbon C.C. Wang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13240-13247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It was proposed that ligand stimulation of β2-AR leads to the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 350 at the C-terminal tail of the β2-AR by a yet to be identified tyrosine kinase. Src then uses its Src homology 2 domain to bind this phosphorylated tyrosine 350. This association to the β2-AR also activates Src (47Fan G. Shumay E. Malbon C.C. Wang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13240-13247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Second, it was reported that Src might phosphorylate and activate G protein-coupled receptor kinases (48Sarnago S. Elorza A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34411-34416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism by which Src family tyrosine kinases participate in the β2-AR internalization needs further investigation (49Ma Y.C. Huang X.Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 46-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our data clearly show that Src is essential for β2-AR internalization in MEF cells. Role of Receptor Internalization in β2-Adrenergic Receptor Signaling to ERK MAPK—Previous studies that used a dominant-negative dynamin mutant and/or mutant arrestin proteins to examine the potential role of receptor internalization in the β2-AR signaling to ERK MAPK yielded inconsistent results. In HEK 293 cells and COS-7 cells, although some researchers reported that receptor internalization was required for β2-AR initiated activation of the ERK MAPK pathway (19Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Our genetic data clearly demonstrate that the receptor internalization is not essential for β2-AR signaling to ERK MAPK in MEF cells. For GPCRs as a whole, whether the receptor internalization is needed for the activation of the ERK MAPK pathway remains to be fully clarified. Some researchers suggested that receptor internalization seems to be needed for activation of the ERK MAPK pathway by some GPCRs (51Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24575-24578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Quite a few reports used dominant-negative mutants of dynamin to evaluate the role of receptor endocytosis in ERK MAPK activation, but caution needs to be exercised when interpreting the results because it has now been reported that dynamin is required for the activation of ERK MAPK by its upstream kinase MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) in cells (59Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35301-35304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It might be helpful to use genetic tools such as loss-of-function mutants or deletions of specific signaling components to demonstrate whether receptor internalization is indeed essential for the signaling of a particular GPCR to ERK MAPK. In summary, we have shown that Src family tyrosine kinases are not required for GαsQ227L stimulation of ERK MAPK in MEF cells. Ligand stimulation of the endogenous Gs-coupled β2-AR also activates ERK MAPK in SYF cells, whereas the internalization of β2-AR is blocked in SYF cells. Furthermore, we found that although the β-arrestin 2 deficiency impairs β2-AR internalization, it has no effect on β2-AR signaling to the ERK MAPK pathway. Therefore, Src and β-arrestin 2 play different roles in β2-AR signaling to ERK MAPK and in receptor internalization, and receptor internalization is not required for β2-AR signaling to ERK MAPK in MEF cells. We thank Dr. R. Lefkowitz for the MEF cells deficient in β-arrestin proteins. We thank T. Maack, D. McGarrigle, and X. Zhou for reading the manuscript."

This process involves formation of an enzyme-bound acyl phosphate (γ-glutamylcysteinyl phosphate), followed by attack of the glycine and formation of an enzyme-product complex, which finally dissociates with the release of GSH, ADP, and phosphate (Pi), as shown in Reaction 1. Glutathione is present in the majority of living cells and is also the most abundant intracellular thiol. It has a number of vital functions: it protects cells against oxidative damage, facilitates the formation of deoxyribonucleotides, reacts with toxic compounds, participates as a coenzyme for enzymes such as glyoxalase (5Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 190: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (6Uotila L. Koivtjsalo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7664-7672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione is also involved in amino acid transport, in metabolism of therapeutic drugs, mutagens, and carcinogens, and in the maintenance of protein thiol groups and ascorbic acid in its reduced form (7Anderson M.E. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 111-112: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Lowered levels of glutathione have been associated with some diseases, for example, human immunodeficiency, hepatitis C, type II diabetes, ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and cataracts (7Anderson M.E. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 111-112: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Substantial attention has been given to human glutathione synthetase because of the biological implications for human patients with hereditary glutathione synthetase deficiency (8Wellner V.P. Sekura R. Meister A. Larsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2505-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In generalized glutathione synthetase deficiency, lowered levels of GSH induce an overproduction of γ-glutamylcysteine due to the lack of feedback inhibition of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase by GSH. Even though γ-glutamylcysteine can compensate for GSH in many aspects of cellular defense against oxidative stress (9Ristoff E. Hebert C. Njalsson R. Norgren S. Rooyackers O. Larsson A. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2002; 25: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the increased amounts of γ-glutamylcysteine lead to accumulation of 5-oxoproline (8Wellner V.P. Sekura R. Meister A. Larsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2505-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 10Larsson A. Mattsson B. Clin. Chim.

On the basis of clinical symptoms, patients with glutathione synthetase deficiency can be classified into three phenotypes: mild, moderate, and severe (or generalized). Patients with mild glutathione synthetase deficiency have hemolytic anemia as their only clinical symptom. Those with moderate glutathione synthetase deficiency usually display symptoms starting from the neonatal period, i.e. metabolic acidosis, 5-oxoprolinuria, and hemolytic anemia. Those with severe glutathione synthetase deficiency also develop progressive neurological symptoms such as seizures and psychomotor retardation (12Ristoff E. Mayatepek E. Larsson A. J. Pediatr. 2001; 139: 79-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The severe form of glutathione synthetase deficiency is caused by mutations in the coding sequence of human glutathione synthetase that lead to a reduction of enzyme activity (13Shi Z.Z. Habib G.M. Rhead W.J. Gahl W.A. He X. Sazer S. Lieberman M.W. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, studies on patients affected by this genetic disorder indicate a residual activity of glutathione synthetase, suggesting that a complete loss of its function is probably lethal (14Dahl N.

Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5184-5190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then was cloned and sequenced in 1995 (25Huang C.S. He W. Meister A. Anderson M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

J. 1995; 310: 353-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported the amino acid sequence for human glutathione synthetase. Currently, the rat and human forms are the most studied mammalian glutathione synthetases. The sequence analysis of the glutathione synthetase enzymes showed that human glutathione synthetase is very similar to rat glutathione synthetase, sharing 88.6% identity, whereas the amino acid sequence comparison to other eukaryotic enzymes revealed a lower identity (18.2-68.8%) (23Meierjohann S.

EMBO J. 1999; 12: 3204-3213Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both human and rat glutathione synthetase enzymes are homodimers with 474 amino acids in each unit, whereas E. coli glutathione synthetase is 158 residues shorter and exists as a tetramer. Despite sharing the same function, the lack of sequence similarity between the two enzymes makes the previous studies of E. coli glutathione synthetase unsuitable for establishing the structure-function relationship of the human enzyme. Extensive kinetic studies of mammalian glutathione synthetase were carried out on the rat and recombinant human enzymes (38Luo J.L. Huang C.S. Babaoglu K. Anderson M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 39Njalsson R. Norgren S. Larsson A. Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Luo J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The results suggested that there is a close catalytic dependence between the two substrates of the homodimer, generating a negative cooperativity for binding of γ-glutamylcysteine substrate. Little was known about the structure of human glutathione synthetase until recently, when Polekhina et al. (37Polekhina G. Board P.C. Gali R. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. EMBO J. 1999; 12: 3204-3213Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) reported its crystal structure. Human glutathione synthetase was cocrystallized with the products: glutathione, ADP, one sulfate ion, which mimics the cleaved γ-phosphate from the ATP, and two magnesium ions (Fig. 1). The three-dimensional structure of human glutathione synthetase shows that it belongs to the glutathione synthetase ATP-binding domain-like superfamily, which consists of enzymes with ATP-dependent carboxylate-amine ligase activity and whose catalytic mechanisms are likely to involve acyl-phosphate intermediates (40Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2639-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The ATP-grasp members display a unique nucleotide-binding fold, referred to as a palmate, or ATP-grasp fold. Even though the catalytic mechanism of human glutathione synthetase is not fully understood, it appears to resemble those of the other ATP-grasp members. Therefore, structural comparison and analysis of the binding sites of the members, especially the ATP-binding site, can provide an insight into the catalytic mechanism of human glutathione synthetase. Additionally, structural and molecular properties investigations of human glutathione synthetase (wild type) compared with human glutathione synthetase (mutants) should reveal significant information about the function of the involved residues in the ATP-grasp superfamily.

After the A600 reached 1.0 (isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; 0.8 mm) was added. After induction (4-6 h), cells were harvested by centrifugation (4225 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) and washed with cold 0.85% NaCl. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in metal chelate affinity chromatography-0 buffer (MCAC-0 buffer; 20 mm Tris-Cl, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0) and disrupted by sonication (three pulses of 2 min with cooling between pulses). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (11,950 × g, 20 min). The clear lysate (∼25 ml) was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Novagen) column previously equilibrated with MCAC-0 buffer. After loading, the column was washed with MCAC-0 buffer. Nonspecific bound proteins were removed by adding MCAC-50 buffer (MCAC-0 buffer plus 50 mm imidazole). Glutathione synthetase enzymes were eluted with MCAC-100 buffer (MCAC-0 buffer plus 100 mm imidazole). The fractions containing human glutathione synthetase were pooled and dialyzed twice against 20 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 8.0 containing 1 mm EDTA, 4 liters). The purified human glutathione synthetase proteins were deemed pure by SDS-PAGE standards (at least 99%). Enzyme Assays and Kinetic Analysis—All kinetic analyses were done in duplicates using purified recombinant glutathione synthetase. The enzyme activity was measured at 37 °C using a spectrophotometric assay, which couples ADP production to NADH oxidation and is monitored at 340 nm (38Luo J.L. Huang C.S. Babaoglu K. Anderson M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 39Njalsson R. Norgren S. Larsson A. Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Luo J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, the standard assay contained buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.2, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium phospho(enol) pyruvate, 0.2 mm NADH), 10 units of pyruvate kinase (Type III rabbit muscle), 10 units of lactic acid dehydrogenase (Type II rabbit muscle), and glutathione synthetase substrates (see below) (final volume of 0.2 ml) and was initiated by the addition of human glutathione synthetase. For Vmax and kcat determinations, the concentration of ATP, gluABA, and glycine were 10, 20, and 10 mm, respectively. Instead of γ-glutamylcysteine, gluABA was used to avoid the complication of thiol oxidation. The apparent Km values were determined using the standard assay where two substrates were held at saturating levels, whereas the third was varied by about 10-fold around the putative Km value. Control reactions contained the standard mix minus gluABA. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic equation was used for glycine and ATP data analysis. For gluABA kinetic analysis, the initial velocity (v), concentration (S), and Vmax are substituted into the Adair equation (Equation 1) for negative cooperativity, and the first Km and alpha (α), or interaction factor are calculated. The second “estimated” Km is obtained by multiplying the first Km by the interaction factor α. The level of negative cooperativity is assessed by use of the Hill plot (V/Vmax - V) versus S, to obtain a Hill coefficient, h. A unit of enzyme is defined as the amount that catalyzes 1 μmol of product per minute at 37 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method (42Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Kinetic data were plotted and nonlinear regression analysis was performed using SigmaPlot software (SPSS Science Inc.). ν=Vmax([S]Km+[S]2αKm2)1+2[S]Km+[S]2αKm2(Eq. 1) Computational Methods—Crystallographic coordinates of the x-ray structure of human glutathione synthetase (glutathione synthetase, human form), reported to a resolution of 2.10 Å, and those of the other proteins were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org/pdb/) (43Berman H.M.

The K2 program (available at zlab.bu.edu/k2/), an automated method that uses a genetic algorithm for aligning the three-dimensional structures of proteins, was employed to study the similarities between human glutathione synthetase and all the other members of the ATP-grasp superfamily. The K2 software first aligns the secondary structure elements of the proteins, starting with the more conserved ones, and then the alignment is extended to include any equivalent positions in loops and turns until the best fit is obtained (44Szustakowski J.D. Weng Z. Proteins. 2000; 38: 428-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Identification of the ATP-grasp members was established using the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) data base (available at scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/index.html) where proteins are clustered into classes, folds, superfamilies, families, and domains, which represent hierarchy levels based on their evolutionary and structural relationships (45Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar). The FSSP (Fold classification based on Structure-Structure alignment of Proteins) data base (www2.ebi.ac.uk/dali/fssp/fssp.html) (46Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), another classification tool, was also employed to obtain structural neighbors of human glutathione synthetase. The active sites of the K2 aligned structures were visualized and analyzed with Swiss Pdb-Viewer (us.expasy.org/spdbv/) (47Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar), a graphics program for studying macromolecular structure, in connection with the LPC software (Ligand-Protein Contacts) (sgedg.weizmann.ac.il/lpc/) (48Sobolev S. Sorokine A. Prilusky A. Abola E.E. Edelman M. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant 2HGS were modeled with the MOE 2002.03 software (Molecular Operating Environment) 2Chemical Computing Group Inc., www.chemcomp.com. using the Amber'94 force field (50Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11589) Google Scholar). Starting with the crystal structure coordinates of human glutathione synthetase, the water molecules were removed, hydrogen atoms were added, and then the resulting structure was minimized with molecular mechanics. Mutants were built by altering distinct residues of the wild type enzyme, followed by energy minimization, before submitting them to the same molecular dynamics protocol (vide infra) employed for wild type human glutathione synthetase. All energy minimization procedures comprised three phases: first the steepest descent algorithm was employed (until r.m.s. gradient < 1000), then the conjugate gradient technique (until r.m.s. gradient < 100), and finally truncated Newton method (until r.m.s. gradient < 0.01). Molecular dynamics simulations with constant NVT (thermodynamic ensemble where the number of particles, the volume, and the temperature are held fixed) and a time step of 0.001 ps were employed to find the lowest energy conformation of each structure (wild type and mutants). Initially, the temperature was raised progressively from 0 to 300 K in 1 ps. The system was then equilibrated at 300 K for 1000 ps during which the atomic coordinates were saved every 100 ps. Tests were carried out with different time length simulations before arriving at 1000 ps as the optimal combination of computational efficiency and accuracy. Finally, the 10 saved geometries were energy minimized and the lowest energy conformation among these was stored for further analysis. Investigations of the active site were carried out for both wild type and mutant human glutathione synthetase enzymes. Hydrogen bonds and atomic distances were computed with the MOE 2002.03 program while interaction enthalpies between the considered constituents of the active site (residues Glu-144, Asn-146, Lys-305, and Lys-364 and ligands ADP2-, ν=Vmax([S]Km+[S]2αKm2)1+2[S]Km+[S]2αKm2, and 2Mg2+) were determined at the semiempirical quantum mechanics level using the Spartan'02 software. 3Wavefunction Inc., www.wavefun.com. The single point enthalpies (heats of formation) of the active site residues and cofactors were computed with the PM3 Hamiltonian (52Stewart J.J.P. J. Comput. Chem. 1989; 10: 221-264Crossref Scopus (3800) Google Scholar). The interaction enthalpy between the two active site elements, denoted in Equation 2 as X and Y, was then estimated. ΔHf(X…Y)=Hf(X+Y)−{Hf(X)+Hf(Y)}(Eq. 2) Similarities between Glutathione Synthetase and Members of ATP-grasp Superfamily—SCOP (45Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar) analysis shows that human glutathione synthetase (PDB code = 2HGS) belongs to the Pre-ATP-grasp superfamily, which is the only member of the Pre-ATP-grasp fold. All members of the Pre-ATP-grasp fold are also members of the ATP-grasp fold. Consequently, human glutathione synthetase is also a member of the glutathione synthetase ATP-binding domain-like superfamily that is one of the two superfamilies included in the ATP-grasp fold. The glutathione synthetase ATP-binding domain-like superfamily consists of 51 proteins that are clustered into six families. A fold, which has one or more superfamilies, consists of proteins with similar major secondary structures in identical arrangement and topological connections. Superfamilies are subsets of a fold and consist of proteins with low sequence identities but whose structural and functional features suggest that a common evolutionary origin is probable. Thus, in the SCOP hierarchy, a common fold indicates a major structural similarity, whereas a common superfamily indicates a probable common evolutionary origin. A common family indicates a clear evolutionary relationship, proteins from the same family share ≈30% or greater sequence identity (45Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar). However, two families (succinyl-CoA synthetase and pyruvate phosphate dikinase) from the glutathione synthetase ATP-binding domain-like superfamily are slightly more different than the other families, because their members are not included in the Pre-ATP-grasp domain superfamily. The members of the two aforementioned families display the same manner of binding the nucleotide inside the active site, but their similarity to the members of the Pre-ATP-grasp is limited to only two domains (pyruvate phosphate dikinase) or one domain (succinyl-CoA synthetase), whereas the members of the other families (eukaryotic and prokaryotic glutathione synthetases, d-alanine-d-alanine ligase, biotin carboxylase, and synapsin Ia) have three common domains. The six most similar proteins to 2HGS were chosen from the Pre-ATP-grasp fold using FSSP data base (Table II). Only those proteins with an FSSP Z score higher than 4 (level of similarity is analogous to second cousins (46Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar)) are desired, because all structural neighbors display a Z score of at least 2, which means that they belong to the same fold as 2HGS.

Conserved residues in the active site of human glutathione synthetase were identified by using LPC analysis and K2 structural alignment for 2HGS and selected proteins. The LPC analysis listed 40 residues in the active site of 2HGS and each one was verified against the alignment output generated by K2 with each of the six proteins just mentioned.Table IIConserved residues in the active site of 2HGS and other closely related ATP membersProtein nameSpeciesPDB IDFSSP Z s"

During S-phase, collisions with replication forks convert these complexes into cytotoxic DNA lesions that trigger cell cycle arrest and cell death. To investigate cellular responses to CPT-induced DNA damage, a yeast genetic screen identified conditional tah mutants with enhanced sensitivity to self-poisoning DNA topoisomerase I mutant (Top1T722Ap), which mimics the action of CPT. Mutant alleles of three genes, DOA4, SLA1 and SLA2, were recovered. A nonsense mutation in DOA4 eliminated the catalytic residues of the Doa4p deubiquitinating enzyme, yet retained the rhodanase domain. At 36 °C, this doa4-10 mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to CPT, osmotic stress, and hydroxyurea, and a reversible petite phenotype. However, the accumulation of pre-vacuolar class E vesicles that was observed in doa4Δ cells was not detected in the doa4-10 mutant. Mutations in SLA1 or SLA2, which alter actin cytoskeleton architecture, induced a conditional synthetic lethal phenotype in combination with doa4-10 in the absence of DNA damage. Here actin cytoskeleton defects coincided with the enhanced fragility of large-budded cells. In contrast, the enhanced sensitivity of doa4-10 mutant cells to Top1T722Ap was unrelated to alterations in endocytosis and was selectively suppressed by increased dosage of the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor Sml1p. Additional studies suggest a role for Doa4p in the Rad9p checkpoint response to Top1p poisons. These findings indicate a functional link between ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and cellular resistance to CPT-induced DNA damage.

These findings indicate a functional link between ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and cellular resistance to CPT-induced DNA damage. DNA topoisomerases catalyze changes in the linkage of DNA strands, allowing for DNA unwinding or decatenation during DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and chromosome segregation (1Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I (Top1p) transiently cleaves a single strand of duplex DNA and forms a covalent tyrosyl linkage with a 3′-phosphoryl DNA end. The covalent Top1p-DNA intermediate allows for DNA rotation while conserving the energy of the cleaved phosphodiester bond. DNA topoisomerase I is the cellular target of the antitumor drug, camptothecin (CPT), 1The abbreviations used are: CPT, camptothecin; ts, temperature-sensitive; HU, hydroxyurea; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DUB, deubiquitinating enzyme; FOA, fluoroorotic acid; DIC, differential interference contrast. which reversibly stabilizes the covalent Top1p-DNA complex by inhibiting DNA religation (3Pizzolato J.F.

The ternary CPT-Top1p-DNA complexes per se are insufficient to induce a cytotoxic response. Rather, collisions with advancing replication forks convert the drug-stabilized complexes into the irreversible DNA lesions that trigger cell cycle arrest and cell death. This model is consistent with the S-phase specificity of CPT and the observation that inhibition of DNA synthesis by aphidicolin abrogates the cytotoxic action of the drug (6Reid R.J.D. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA topoisomerase I is nonessential (6Reid R.J.D. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Fiorani P. Bjornsti M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 922: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). top1Δ strains are resistant to CPT, although drug sensitivity may be restored by expressing plasmid-borne yeast or human TOP1. Thus, the cytotoxic action of CPT does not derive from the inhibition of Top1p catalytic activity; rather the drug converts this nonessential enzyme into a cellular toxin. Biochemical and structural data have begun to reveal the domainal organization of Top1p critical for DNA binding, enzyme catalysis, and CPT sensitivity (8Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S.

Hypomorphic alleles of CDC45 and DBP11, isolated in our screen for top1T722A- hypersensitive (tah) mutants, induce a transient accumulation of Okazaki-sized DNA fragments and enhance cell sensitivity to Top1p-induced DNA damage (39Reid R.J.

These results link processive DNA replication with cellular resistance to CPT. Here we report the characterization of three additional tah mutants, doa4-10, sla1-10, and sla2-10, that exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the self-poisoning Top1T722Ap at 36 °C. We provide evidence that the Doa4 deubiquitinating enzyme and the cortical actin proteins, Sla1p and Sla2p, function to protect cells from Top1p-induced DNA damage. Doa4p is a ubiquitin-specific protease that physically associates with the 26 S proteasome and recycles ubiquitin from proteins targeted for proteolytic degradation (41Papa F.R. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 42Swaminathan S. Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2583-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Doa4p also functions in the endocytic pathway to remove ubiquitin from plasma membrane proteins targeted for vacuolar degradation (43Amerik A.Y. Nowak J. Swaminathan S. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36679-36683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), functions as a specific dosage suppressor of doa4-10 sensitivity to Top1T722Ap-induced lethality. Further studies of checkpoint mutants, such as rad9Δ, mec1Δ, and tel1Δ, suggest doa4-10-mediated alterations in the Rad9p DNA damage checkpoint. These results are discussed in terms of a functional link between ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, cortical actin organization, and cellular responses to Top1p poisons. Strains and Plasmids—Yeast strains are listed in Table I. Gene disruptions were made by PCR (48Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R.

ARS/CEN vectors expressing TOP1 and top1T722A from constitutive TOP1 promoters, YCpScTOP1 and YCpSctop1T722A, respectively, were described (26Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

Analogous LEU2-based vectors, YCpScTOP1·L or YCp-Sctop1T722A·L, were constructed by ligating an ApaI/SacII DNA fragment into plasmid pRS415. pRS416 and pRS415 served as vector controls (49Sikorski R.S.

A YEp-FY250 yeast genomic DNA library was similarly constructed by ligating size-fractionated (6-10 kbp) and partially Sau3A-digested DNA into the dephosphorylated BamHI ends of vector YEp24-PL, followed by amplification in Escherichia coli.Table IYeast strainsStrainGenotypeRef.EKY2MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::HIS356EKY3MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP156RRY72-3MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, cdc45-1039RRY76-3MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, sla1-10This workPFY83MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, sla1-10, rho°This workRRY84-3MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, sla2-10This workRRY90MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, sla1-20This workRRY92-3MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10This workPFY52MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, rho°This workMSY6MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, cdc45-10This workMSY61MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, sla1-10This workPFY84MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, sla1-10, rho°This workMSY75MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, sla2-10This workMSY85MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4Δ::URA3This workPFY53MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4Δ::URA3, rho°This workMMY3MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, rad9Δ::hisG26PFY74MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, rad9Δ::his5+This workPFY50MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, sml1Δ::his5+This workPFY48MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, sml1Δ::his5+This workPFY68MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, tdp1Δ::his5+This workPFY67MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, tdp1Δ::his5+This workPFY60MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, sla1Δ::his5+This workPFY61MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4Δ::URA3, sla1Δ::his5+This workPFY62MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, sla1Δ::his5+This workPFY73MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, rad17Δ::his5+This workPFY72MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, rad17Δ::his5+This workPFY81MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, chk1Δ::his5+This workPFY80MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, chk1Δ::his5+This workPFY90MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, tof1Δ::his5+This workPFY91MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, tof1Δ::his5+This workPTY15MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, tel1Δ::his5+This workPTY12MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, tel1Δ::his5+This workPTY4MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, rad24Δ::his5+This workPTY5MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, rad24Δ::his5+This workPFY79MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, sml1Δ::HIS3, mec1Δ::KANThis workPTY13MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, sml1Δ::his5+, mec1Δ::KANThis workPTY6MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, sml1Δ::HIS3, rad53Δ::KANThis workPTY14MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, sml1Δ::his5+, rad53Δ::KANThis workHJY6MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, DOA4-HAThis workHJY7MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10-HAThis workHGY1MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, vps4Δ::his5+This workHGY2MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, doa4-10, vps4Δ::his5+This workPTY44MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, ubp5Δ::his5+This workLBY11MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, ubp11Δ::TRP1This workPTY43MATa, ura3-52, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, trp1Δ63, top1Δ::TRP1, ubp12Δ::his5+This work Open table in a new tab tah Mutant Isolation—A genetic screen for tah mutants exhibiting temperature sensitivity to top1T722A was described (39Reid R.J. Fiorani P. Sugawara M. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11440-11445Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, top1Δ cells, transformed with YCpSctop1T722A, were subjected to ethyl methonesulfonate mutagenesis and screened for colonies exhibiting temperature-sensitive (ts) growth at 36 °C. Plating on 5-FOA eliminated mutants where ts growth was not linked to plasmid-encoded Top1T722Ap. Backcrossing to TAH+, top1Δ strains identified 10 tah mutants, where a single recessive gene defect was linked to top1T722A hypersensitivity. Complementation analysis determined that tah6 and tah20 were allelic. Cloning DOA4, SLA1, and SLA2 by Complementation—tah22, tah20, and tah14 strains, transformed with YCp-FY250 library DNA, were screened for plasmid-dependent growth at 36 °C on SC-uracil media containing 10 mg/ml HU. The smaller of the overlapping TAH22 clones contained 5.9 kbp of chromosome IV including YDR068, DOA4, and YDR070. A TAH20 clone contained 5.7 kbp of chromosome II encompassing SLA1 and YBL006. This clone also complemented the HU hypersensitivity of the tah6 strain. TAH14 clone contained 8.4 kbp of chromosome XIV with only one gene, SLA2. Subcloning confirmed that DOA4, SLA1, and SLA2 complemented the HU and top1T722A hypersensitivity of tah22, tah6/tah20, and tah14, respectively. A YEpDOA4 vector was made by ligating a 5.4-kbp SpeI DNA fragment, excised from TAH22 clone, into YEp24-PL. To confirm the genetic identity of TAH22 as DOA4, TAH6/20 as SLA1, and TAH14 as SLA2, a selectable URA3 (or LEU2) marker was integrated into the genomic sequences flanking DOA4, SLA1, and SLA2, respectively. After mating with respective tah22, tah6, and tah14 mutants, meiotic products were assessed for segregation of uracil (or leucine) prototrophy and the tah phenotype. Integration constructs were as follows: a 2.7-kbp NotI DNA fragment from TAH22 clone was ligated into pRS406 to yield YIpDOA4·U or pRS405 to make YIpDOA4·L. Transformation of EKY2 cells with MscI-digested DNA targeted integration 5′ to DOA4. A LEU2-based YIpSLA1·L vector was made by ligating a 2.1-kbp PstI DNA fragment from TAH20 clone, into pRS405. AvrII digestion targeted URA3 integration 3′ to SLA1. To target URA3 integration to sequences 3′ to SLA2, a 2.4-kbp NotI/XbaI DNA fragment excised from the TAH14 clone was ligated into pRS406. EKY2 cells were transformed with HpaI-digested YIpSLA2. Mutant doa4-10 and sla1-10 alleles were recovered after targeted integration of YIpDOA4·L and YIpSLA1·L, respectively. Purified genomic DNA was restricted with HindIII (doa4-10) or ClaI (sla1-10). Size-selected DNA fragments were ligated and transformed into E. coli. DNA sequencing defined the mutations in doa4-10 and sla1-10. A C-terminal HA tag was introduced into wild type DOA4 using a URA3 marker flanked by 3× HA tags (50Schneider B.L. Seufert W. Steiner B. Yang Q.H. Futcher A.B. Yeast. 1995; 11: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A C-terminal HA tag and stop codon were introduced after residue 387 in DOA4 to generate doa4-10-HA. HA-URA3-HA was integrated into a single DOA4 locus in diploid EKY23 cells. Meiotic products were screened for uracil prototrophy and sensitivity to HU. Excision of URA3 was selected on 5-FOA plates, and the generation of doa4-10-HA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. DOA4-HA and doa4-10-HA cell sensitivity to top1T722A, CPT, and HU was indistinguishable from that of DOA4 and doa4-10 strains, respectively. Cell Viability Assays—Exponentially growing cells, transformed with YCpScTOP1, YCpSctop1T722A, or pRS416, were 10-fold serially diluted, and 5-μl aliquots were spotted on SC-uracil plates. Cell viability was assessed after incubation at 26 °C or 36 °C. To assay CPT sensitivity, YCpScTOP1-transformed cells were spotted onto SC-uracil media plus 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.125% Me2SO and 0 or 5 μg/ml CPT. To quantitate colony formation, serial dilutions of transformed cells were plated onto SC-uracil media (+ or - CPT) and incubated at 26 or 36 °C. Cell sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate (0.0125 or 0.025%), HU (5 or 10 mg/ml), or UV (10 or 20 μJ/M2) was assayed as described (39Reid R.J. Fiorani P. Sugawara M. Bjornsti M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11440-11445Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to high salt was assayed on YPD, 6% NaCl plates. Cell growth on nonfermentable carbon sources was assessed on yeast extract, peptone, 3% glycerol plates. To quantitate HU sensitivity, cultures exponentially growing at 26 °C were divided, and half was treated with 15 mg/ml HU. After 30 min, the cultures were shifted to 36 °C(t = 0). At various times, aliquots were diluted and plated onto YPD media at 26 °C. Colony formation was assessed at 26 °C. Aliquots of cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stored at -20 °C for subsequent DAPI staining and microscopy. Actin Localization and DAPI Staining—Exponentially growing DOA4, doa4-10, and sla1-10 cells, in YPD at 26 and 36 °C, were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. After 2 h, the pelleted cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. For actin staining (51Adams A.E. Pringle J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, stained with 0.66 μm rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes), and then mixed with mounting media (Molecular Probes) on polylysine-coated Teflon slides. For DAPI staining of DNA, cells spotted on polylysine-coated Teflon slides were suspended in 0.2 μg/ml DAPI and mounting media. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope equipped with DIC, epifluorescence, and UV blocking filter sets. Images were acquired with a Micromax CCD camera and IP lab software (Scanalytics). Electron Microscopy—Cells were fixed, embedded, and stained as described (52Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I.

Cells, pelleted by centrifugation, were resuspended in freshly prepared 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.7, 1 m sorbitol, 0.5% glutaraldehyde, and 3% formaldehyde for 1 h, washed three times with 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.7, and resuspended in 1% NaIO4 for 10 min. After quenching free aldehyde groups with 50 mm NH4Cl, cells were washed with water and successively dehydrated in EtOH (50, 70, 80, 85, 90, and 95% and two washes in 100% EtOH) at 4 °C, followed by 100% EtOH at room temperature. Infiltration and polymerization of LR White embedding media were as per manufacturer's instructions (Polysciences). Thin sections (50 nm) were cut with a Leica UltraCut ultramicrotome, mounted on copper grids coated with a 2% collodium film, stained with 2% uranyl acetate and Reinold lead citrate, and observed in a Jeol Jem 10-10 microscope at 80 kV. Magnifications were corrected using a tropomyosin crystal standard. DNA Topoisomerase I Activity and Immunoprecipitation—Top1 protein levels in DOA4 and doa4-10 cells transformed with YCpScTOP1 or YCpSctop1T722A were assessed in crude extracts prepared from exponential cultures grown at 26 °C or shifted to 36 °C for 4-24 h.

In vitro transcription with the galP1 promoter having a natural or unnatural base in either strand at position –11 showed that only a purine base with no side group at C2 in the nontemplate strand is transcriptionally potent; neither a purine with an amino group at C2 nor a pyrimidine support transcription. The amino group at C6 in the omnipresent adenine at –11 does not play any role in promoting transcription. The nature of the base, complementary or noncomplementary, at –11 in the template strand also does not influence transcription.

Transcription initiation executed by a bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme (Eσ) starts with its binding to a promoter DNA sequence (formation of a closed complex) and is followed by a multistep process leading to the formation of an open complex. The open complex is competent to initiate polymerization of ribonucleotides according to the DNA sequences of the template strand (1Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev.

It is believed that in a fully mature open complex, about 15 base pairs in DNA (from –12 to +3 relative to the transcription start site) become single-stranded by the so-called “melting” process, which we will refer to as DNA deformation (16Roberts C.W.

Several amino acid residues in the 2.3–2.4 region of the σ subunit were inferred to make consequential contacts with bases in the –10 region of the promoter: Phe427, Tyr430, and Trp433 in the formation of the open complex, Lys414, Lys415, Tyr425, Phe427, and Tyr430 in binding to single-stranded DNA following DNA deformation, and Tyr430 in the stabilization of the open complex (4deHaseth P.L.

Although these amino acid residues were shown to strategically lie on one face of the σ subunit to be able to perform the two functions in open complex formation, RNA polymerase binding and DNA deformation (10Malhotra A.

Studies of transcription initiation with specifically designed DNA templates suggested that DNA deformation nucleates at around position –10/–11 (9Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D.

The omnipresent A:T base pair at the position –11 was specifically suggested to play a “master” role in signaling DNA deformation (29Lim H.M. Lee H.J. Roy S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14849-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We investigated the properties of the –11 base pair, which are critical in interacting with σ and in signaling base pair deformation. In Vitro Transcription Assay—In vitro transcription reactions were performed in a 25-μl volume following the procedure of Choy and Adhya (30Choy H.E. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 472-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The σ70-saturated RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli was purchased from Epicenter Technologies (Madison, WI). The reaction mixture (22.5 μl) contained 4 nm PCR-generated DNA template (2 nm for negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA), 20 nm RNA polymerase, 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 200 mm potassium glutamate, and 20 units of rRNasin (Promega, Madison, WI). The reactions were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min and started by the addition of 2.5 μl of NTP (2 mm of ATP, GTP, and CTP, 0.2 mm UTP, and 2.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP). They were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and stopped by the addition of 25 μl of RNA loading buffer (95% deionized formamide, 5 mm EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol). Samples were boiled for 2 min and chilled on ice, and 2.5 μl of samples were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gels. The transcripts were quantified by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosceinces). DNA Template Preparation—Synthetic oilgonucleotides (105 nucleotides long) containing various nucleotides at –11 position of the gal P1 promoter were obtained from Genosys (The Woodlands, TX) and were purified by PAGE. 358-bp-long DNA templates for transcription containing adenine, 2-aminopurine, 2,6-diaminopurine, or purine (experiments 1, 8, 12, and 16 in Table I) were prepared by PCR using the pSA852 plasmid DNA as template as described previously (29Lim H.M. Lee H.J. Roy S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14849-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The position and the size of the primers are indicated in Fig. 2. The PCR products were treated with the PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and electrophoresed in agarose gel. The desired product embedded in the gel was cut out and electroeluted. The resulting DNA fragments were further cleaned by G-50 spin column (Amersham Biosciences). DNA templates with mismatched base pairs (experiments 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15) were prepared as follows. The complementary strands of DNA templates containing mismatched bases at –11 position were synthesized individually using an asymmetric PCR method that employs only a single primer, and the relevant pairs of amplified single-stranded DNA were duplexed by mixing the corresponding PCR reaction products. After hybridization, the products were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. The hybridized DNA band was cut out and purified as described above for double-stranded PCR products. All PCR and hybridization-generated DNA templates contained two mutations (–19 G to T and –20T to G), which largely inactivate the P2 promoter (31Busby S. Aiba H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 154: 211-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A site-directed mutagenesis method (32Barik S. Galinski M.S. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 489-490PubMed Google Scholar) was used to change the pSA852 plasmid into one carrying guanine, thymine, or cytosine instead of adenine at the –11 position (experiments 2–4 in Table I). The latter constructs were directly used for in vitro transcription as supercoiled DNA templates.Table IBase pairs at - 11 position versus in vitro transcription at the P1 promoter of galTemplatePPPPHHHPHHHPHHHPSourceExperiment12345678910111213141516NontemplateAGCTAGC2AP2AP2AP2APPuPuPuPu26APTemplateTCGAAAATAGCTAGCTTranscriptionYNNNYNNNNNNYYYYN Open table in a new tab The fact that the presence of 2-aminopurine at –11 of the nontemplate strand in the gal promoters made the promoter defective for transcription suggested that the position of the substitution group in the purine ring at –11 of the nontemplate strand is the source of the inhibitory effect. Substitution of the Nontemplate Strand Adenine C2H at –11 Is Deleterious—The structural difference between 2-aminopurine and adenine (6-aminopurine) is in the position of the amino group (Fig. 1). We addressed the question whether the presence of an amino group at the C2 position or the absence of an amino group at the C6 position or both in 2-aminopurine prevented transcription. We performed in vitro transcription assays with Eσ70 on DNA templates that contained various unnatural bases at –11 position of the P1 promoter of gal. The DNA templates were supercoiled plasmid or fragments generated by PCR or hybridization of single-stranded PCR products (Fig. 2). The bases used were purine, adenine, 2-aminopurine, 2,6-diaminopurine, guanine, as well as the two pyrimidines, thymine, and cytosine. The P2 promoter of gal in the templates used in these studies was inactivated unless mentioned (31Busby S. Aiba H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 154: 211-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The sample results of the transcription assays are shown in Fig. 3, and the entire data set are summarized in Table I. As shown in Fig. 3, the wild type template (with adenine at –11) produced two transcripts, a 135-nt 1The abbreviation used is: nt, nucleotide. -long P1 RNA and a 121-nt-long P3 RNA (lanes 1 and 2). The P3 RNA was not made when a supercoiled plasmid DNA was the template (29Lim H.M. Lee H.J. Roy S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14849-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Ponnambalam S. Spassky A. Busby S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The DNA template having 2-aminopurine at –11 of the P1 promoter did not yield transcripts from P1 (lane 3). When 2,6-diaminopurine with amino groups at both C2 and C6 positions of the purine ring was present at –11 of P1, the DNA template did not yield P1 transcripts either (lane 4). These results showed that the presence of an amino group at C6 does not ensure the ability of a purine base at –11 to allow transcription from P1. However, we observed that a DNA template having a purine base (no amino group in either position) at –11 of P1 made RNA from the promoter as much as the wild type template (lane 5). DNA sequencing confirmed that the template strand base complementary to the unnatural bases (2-aminopurine, 2,6-diaminopurine, and purine) in the template strand was thymine (Table I), showing that the substitutions at the –11 position of the nontemplate strand were solely responsible for the observed behavior of the templates.Fig. 3In vitro transcription of gal DNA containing different base pairs at –11. The gal transcripts are identified in the margin. The P2 promoter was largely inactivated in the PCR generated templates. The P3 RNA were not made in the plasmid DNA templates (lanes 1 and 6). The base at the –11 position of the nontemplate strand was adenine (lanes 1 and 2), 2-aminopurine (lane 3), 2,6-diaminopurine (lane 4), purine (lane 5), and guanine (lane 6). Lanes 1 and 6 are supercoiled DNA. Other details are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above results demonstrated that if an amino group is placed at C2 of the purine ring at –11 in the nontemplate strand of the P1 promoter, the substitution becomes detrimental to transcription initiation. The presence of an amino group at C6 of the purine base is not important. This conclusion was further supported by the use of guanine at the –11 position of the nontemplate strand (lane 6). Guanine has an amino group at C2 and oxygen at C6 of the purine ring (Fig. 1). The template with guanine in the nontemplate and cytosine in template strand was inactive for P1 transcription (Fig. 3, lane 6). The –11 position did not accept a pyrimidine base (cytosine or thymine) either, suggesting a strict requirement of an adenine or a purine at –11 (Table I). Our observation of the essential nature of a purine base with an unmodified C2 hydrogen at –11 for promoter activity is consistent with a previous report that depurination of adenine, while stimulating open complex formation when at position –12, –10, or +1, inhibited the process when at position –11 (28Li X.Y. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23558-23566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The Nature of the Template Strand Base at –11 Is Inconsequential—To test whether the base in the template strand at the –11 position plays any role, several templates were made in which the base at –11 nontemplate strand, adenine, 2-amin-opurine, purine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine, was paired against a non-Watson-Crick complement. The templates were tested for P1 transcription. The results showed that the transcriptional ability of the templates does not depend upon the nature of the base in the nontemplate strand (Table I). A mismatch did not change the behavior of the base in the non-template strand; adenine and purine remained transcriptionally active, and 2-aminopurine, guanine, and cytosine showed a mutational effect irrespective of the nature of the base in the other strand. Thus, having a heteroduplex pairing at the most critical position of the –10 region of the promoter is not a problem in the promoter function. (Thymine paired with a noncomplementary base was not tested.) The PCR-generated DNA templates containing different bases at –11 of P1 did not significantly change the P3 RNA synthesis. The innocuous effect of base substitutions at some positions of the template strand as opposed to that in the nontemplate strand was reported before (16Roberts C.W. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We established that an unsubstituted C2 hydrogen of a purine base is essential and sufficient at the nontemplate strand of the critical –11 position for the promoter to be transcriptionally competent. If an amino acid side chain(s) in the σ 2.3–2.4 region makes a direct contact with the –11 adenine, then either the interaction involves the C2 hydrogen (a likely hydrophobic linkage) or the substitution of the C2 hydrogen causes a steric problem for the interaction. In B-DNA structure, the C2 hydrogen of an adenine is available in the minor groove (34Dickerson R.E. Drew H.R. Conner B.N. Wing R.M. Fratini A.V. Kopka M.L. Science. 1982; 216: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, the line-up of base-edge interaction potential (with a protein) through the minor groove in an A:T base pair is practically the same as that in a T:A base pair: H bond acceptor-H atom-H bond acceptor (Fig. 4). Since the consensus sequence (TATAAT) of the –10 element has only A:T or T:A base pair, it is difficult to imagine how an amino acid side chain in the σ protein can discriminate between the –11 and other positions in the neighborhood while establishing a contact using the minor groove. One likelihood is that the –11 adenine becomes extrahelical thus providing specificity to σ. Indeed it was suggested previously that –11 adenine interacts with σ by becoming stacked between two aromatic amino acid residues, Tyr430 and Trp433, in the 2.3 region of the subunit (9Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, we believe that a base intercalation between two adjacent planar aromatic side chains, e.g. Trp433 and Trp434 (a separation of about 3.5 Å) or between Tyr430 and Trp433 (a separation of 5.1 Å) in the protein α-helix may not be energetically feasible. An alternative idea is that the extrahelical base contacts amino acid side chain(s) through base edge. As opposed to the sandwich structure, an extrahelical base interaction with a single aromatic residue, prevalent in many reported structures of DNA-protein complexes with flipped out bases, is favored by deHaseth and colleagues (35Tomsic M.

Proteins. 1999; 35: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Whether the –11 adenine interaction with σ involves base intercalation between aromatic rings or base edge and a single amino acid side chain, our results suggest that an unsubstituted C2 hydrogen in the slipped out –11 adenine is critical for the contact. Although the adenine residue at –11 is the first base to be distorted to initiate the process of isomerization (29Lim H.M. Lee H.J. Roy S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14849-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the subsequent deformation of the base pairs in the –10 region is not a sequential process beginning at –11 (42Roy S. Lim H.M. Lui M. Adhya S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We postulate that the –11 adenine interaction (intercalation or base edge-amino acid side chain interaction) induces major changes in the structure of RNA polymerase instructing other amino acid residues in σ to make individual contacts with the remaining base pairs of the –10 region and deform them with a pattern that is detected by the DNA sequence of the promoter. Incidentally, about 5% of E. coli promoters do not have an adenine at position –11 (43Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2237-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar). We presume that these promoters use another position in the –10 region to initiate open complex formation."

In this report, we have shown that the assembled complexes (intasomes) formed in vitro with linear 3.6-kbp DNA donors possessing 3′-OH-recessed attachment (att) site sequences and avian myeloblastosis virus IN (4 nm) were as competent for full-site integration as isolated retrovirus PIC. The att sites on DNA with 3′-OH-recessed ends were protected by IN in assembled intasomes from DNase I digestion up to ∼20 bp from the terminus. Several DNA donors containing either normal blunt-ended att sites or different end mutations did not allow assembly of complexes that exhibit the ∼20-bp DNase I footprint at 14 °C. At 50 and 100 mm NaCl, the ∼20-bp DNase I footprints were produced with wild type (wt) U3 and gain-of-function att site donors for full-site integration as previously observed at 320 mm NaCl. Although the wt U5 att site donors were fully competent for full-site integration at 37 °C, the ∼20-bp DNase I footprint was not observed under a variety of assembly conditions including low NaCl concentrations at 14 °C. Under suboptimal assembly conditions for intasomes using U3 att DNA, DNase I probing demonstrated an enhanced cleavage site 9 bp from the end of U3 suggesting that a transient structural intasome intermediate was identified. Using a single nucleotide change at position 7 from the end and a series of small size deletions of wt U3 att site sequences, we determined that sequences upstream of the 11th nucleotide position were not required by IN to produce the ∼20-bp DNase I footprint and full-site integration.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17358-17364Google Scholar). Characterization of IN interactions with the viral DNA in purified intasomes by MM-PCR footprinting revealed protection and enhancements near the termini (∼20 bp from the ends) with an extended region of protection mapping several hundred bp from the ends (6Wei S.Q. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10535-10540Google Scholar, 8Chen H. Wei S.Q. Engelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17358-17364Google Scholar). The requirement for a large footprint in relationship to the requirement of having a <12-bp att site at the termini necessary for efficient integration in vivo is unclear (1Brown P.O. Coffin J. Hughes S. Varmus H. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 161-203Google Scholar, 8Chen H. Wei S.Q. Engelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17358-17364Google Scholar). DNase I protection analysis of reconstituted AMV and recombinant Rous sarcoma virus IN-DNA intasomes that are capable of efficient full-site integration in vitro showed that the interactions of IN with viral DNA substrates produced a defined outer boundary mapping ∼20 bp from the DNA ends (13Vora A. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3556-3567Google Scholar, 14Chiu R. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6482-6492Google Scholar). The number and structural configuration of IN subunits that are required with either retrovirus intasomes or reconstituted intasomes performing concerted integration are unknown. Molecular modeling has also been used to describe potential interactions of IN at the viral DNA ends for integration (15Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6667-6678Google Scholar, 16Yang Z.N. Mueser T.C. Bushman F.D. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 535-548Google Scholar, 17Chen J.C. Krucinski J. Miercke L.J. Finer-Moore J.S.

Biol. 2001; 8: 302-307Google Scholar). The shared premise of these independent approaches suggest that IN forms multimers at the viral DNA ends for concerted integration. In this report, we have shown that assembled avian retrovirus intasomes in vitro possess equivalent full-site integration activity compared with that reported for HIV-1, MLV, and Rous sarcoma virus intasomes purified from virus-infected cells. We characterized the Mg2+ and the structural DNA att site end requirements for assembling intasomes using purified AMV IN with linear 3.6-kbp donor DNA substrates for full-site integration (Fig. 1). Although wt U5 att donors possessing 3′-OH-recessed termini are competent for full-site integration, IN does not produce the ∼20-bp footprint even at low NaCl (100 mm) and relatively high IN concentrations (∼15 nm) in contrast to ∼20-bp footprints on U3 att sequences under these same conditions. Under suboptimal assembly conditions for intasomes, DNase I probing demonstrated an enhanced cleavage site 9 bp from the end of the U3 att DNA suggesting that a transient structural intasome intermediate was identified. With a series of small size deletions of wt U3 att site sequences and a single nucleotide change at position 7 from the end, we demonstrated that sequences only up to the 11th nucleotide from the end were required by IN to produce the minimum outer boundary ∼20-bp footprint observed with full-site integration. In summary, the results suggested that the organization of IN at the att sites in reconstituted intasomes is similar to intasomes purified from virus-infected cells. Production of DNA Substrates—Linear 4.5-kbp donors containing terminal avian retrovirus (Schmidt-Ruppin strain A) wt U3 and U5 LTRs (each 330 bp in length) were previously described (13Vora A. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3556-3567Google Scholar). In brief, an NdeI site was placed at the circle junction of the joined U3 and U5 ends. NdeI digestion produced a linear 4.5-kbp donor containing 3′-OH-recessed ends. Numbering of the nucleotides originated from the blunt-ends of the donors. Modifications of the 5th, 6th, and 7th nucleotides on the termini of the catalytic strand are indicated in Table I (21Vora A.C. Chiu R. McCord M. Goodarzi G. Stahl S.J. Mueser T.C. Hyde C.C.

The extension of each LTR blunt-end by one nucleotide in the original viral circle junction DNA clone produced a unique DraI site between the wt U5 and U3 ends.Table IStructure-functional relationships for full-site integrationFull-site integrationDNase I footprint protection (≈20 bp)3′-OH-recessed LTRwtawt represents wild-type, whereas G and L represent gain and loss-of-function, respectively.

Some of the data were previously published (13Vora A. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3556-3567Google Scholar) and are summarized in this table Open table in a new tab Another series of large size donors containing wt U5 and mutant U3 att sites were constructed. A single nucleotide change and a series of deletions were introduced into wt U3 terminal LTR sequences. Oligonucleotides containing different mutations in U3 att sequences, immediately adjacent to wt U5 att sequences, were produced for cloning into pGEM-3. The top strand always contained 74 nucleotides and the bottom complementary strand 66 nucleotides to maintain the same spatial arrangements of restriction sites and nucleotide sequences. The arrangements were: BamHI-BglII-U3 sequences-NdeI-U5 sequences-KpnI. The sequence of the top strand for wt U3 and U5 with the above arranged restriction sites is 5′-GATCCAGATCTTGTTGCAAGACTACAAGAGTATTGCATAAGACTACATATGAAGCCTTCTGCTTCATGCGGTAC, respectively. The overlapping terminal BamHI and KpnI sites were used for forced ligation of the annealed oligonucleotides into pGEM-3 digested with BamHI and KpnI. The U3 sequences were 36 nucleotides in length including the CA dinucleotide located in the internal NdeI site, whereas the U5 sequences were 22 nucleotides in length. The modifications in wt U3 sequences were: a single nucleotide change C to A at position 7; deletions from 8 to 12, 12 to 15, 15 to 18, 18 to 22, 20 to 26, and 24 to 38. The deleted sequences were always replaced with the next upstream adjacent U3 LTR sequences. All of the plasmid constructs were sequenced to verify the inserted LTR oligonucleotides. NdeI digestion of the constructs produced 2.9-kbp linear donors possessing 3′-OH-recessed U3 and U5 ends. ScaI and BglI digestions of the NdeI-digested plasmid were used to isolate unlabeled ∼1600-bp DNA fragments containing only the U5 and U3 att sites, respectively. Labeling of DNA Donors—The linear 2.9- and 4.5-kbp donors were 5′ end-labeled on the noncatalytic strand with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. The specific activities were ∼1,600–2,000 cpm (Cererkov) per ng of DNA. For assembly and DNase I footprint studies, the 5′ end-labeled 4.5-kbp donors were digested at either the NheI or XhoI sites to produce 3.6-kbp single-end labeled U3 or U5 donors, respectively (13Vora A. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3556-3567Google Scholar). The 2.9-kbp donors were digested with either BamHI or KpnI to produce nearly 2.9-kbp single-ended att donors. For measuring the 3′-OH processing activity of IN, several of the above 3′-OH-recessed 4.5-kbp DNA donors were filled in with [32P]dTTP and unlabeled dATP using Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) at 7 °C (23Vora A.C. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7483-7488Google Scholar). Purification of AMV IN—IN was purified to near homogeneity as previously described (24Grandgenett D.P. Vora A.C. Schiff R.D. Virology. 1978; 89: 119-132Google Scholar, 25Knaus R.J. Hippenmeyer P.J. Misra T.K. Grandgenett D.P. Muller U.R. Fitch W.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 350-359Google Scholar). Full-site integration and 3′-OH Processing Assays—Assembly of IN for strand transfer with 3.6-kbp single-ended U3 or U5 DNA donors (8 ng) was accomplished in the presence of 320 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 8% polyethylene glycol (6,000 daltons), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The standard reaction volumes were 20 μl or higher multiples. The time and temperature for assembly of IN with the donors were routinely 45 min and 14 °C, respectively. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 50 ng of supercoiled 2.8-kbp DNA (pGEM-3) as target and immediately incubated at 37 °C for either 5 min or as indicated. The reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA, SDS, and proteinase K digestion followed by phenol extraction. Equivalent amounts of labeled products from the reactions were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The amounts of donor incorporated into target DNA as full-site and half-site products were determined with a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager™. Half-site integration is defined as the insertion of one donor molecule into the target. For the 3′-OH processing reactions, IN was assembled with single att blunt end-labeled 3.6-kbp donors at 14 °C as described above for strand transfer with no target added. The release of the labeled dinucleotides from the blunt-ended LTR donors by IN at either 37 or 14 °C for 5 min were measured as acid-soluble counts (Cererkov). The acid-soluble counts were expressed as a percentage of the input donor substrate. DNase I Footprinting—For assembly at ∼300 mm NaCl and DNase I footprint analyses, IN and the single end-labeled 3.6-kbp donors (8 ng or 0.17 nm) and the 2.9-kbp U3 deletion mutants donors (10 ng or 0.26 nm) were assembled at 14 °C for 45 min (Fig. 1). For some experiments with either the 3.6-kbp donors or the 2.9-kbp donors, different mixtures of labeled and unlabeled donors were mixed together (13Vora A. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3556-3567Google Scholar, 26McCord M. Chiu R. Vora A.C. Grandgenett D.P. Virology. 1999; 259: 392-401Google Scholar). An aliquot was removed from the mixture for measuring strand transfer activities just prior to the addition of DNase I to 750 ng/ml for 90 s digestion at 14 °C. When measuring strand transfer activity at 50 and 100 mm NaCl concentrations, the DNase I concentrations were reduced to 75 ng/ml for footprint analysis. The DNase I reactions were stopped by the addition of phenol and equivalent amounts of each reaction were subjected to denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The dried gels were analyzed by phosphorimaging and exposure to x-ray films. Restriction enzyme digestion at two internals sites on linear viral DNA packaged within purified HIV-1 intasomes, followed by size purification of the separated products, demonstrated that the synapsed DNA ends in the intasomes are held together by a protein bridge (4Miller M.D. Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5382-5390Google Scholar). A similar bimolecular event holding together the two viral DNA ends by purified IN (Fig. 1) mirrors the coordinated integration of two independent viral DNA ends into target DNA. The total amount of viral DNA integrated by HIV-1 and MLV intasomes purified from cells varies between 10 and 50% into target DNA following incubation for 45–90 min at 37 °C (4Miller M.D. Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5382-5390Google Scholar, 7Brown H.E. Chen H. Engelman A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9011-9020Google Scholar, 8Chen H. Wei S.Q. Engelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17358-17364Google Scholar, 27Chen H. Engelman A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8188-8193Google Scholar, 28Wei S.Q. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7511-7520Google Scholar). Purified retrovirus intasomes generally produce only concerted integration products equivalent to the full-site integration products described in this report although side reactions (autointegration of viral DNA into itself) can also occur (29Lee Y.M. Coffin J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5958-5965Google Scholar, 30Lee M.S. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1528-1533Google Scholar). Equivalence of Reconstituted Avian Retrovirus Intasomes to Purified Retrovirus Intasomes from Cells for Full-site Integration Activity—Assembled AMV IN-viral DNA complexes (45 min at 14 °C) produced significant amounts of full-site integration products in 20 min at 37 °C at low IN concentrations (Fig. 2) equivalent to the amounts observed with purified retrovirus intasomes. With this assay configuration, saturation of the donor substrate (3.6 kbp) containing a single LTR end by IN occurs at ∼4 nm (Fig. 2A). Approximately 40% of the donor is incorporated into full-site products with ∼5% of the donor being incorporated into half-site products at 37 °C (Fig. 2B). The results suggest that the reconstitution of AMV IN with viral DNA donors appears equivalent to purified retrovirus intasomes for production of full-site integration products. The divalent metal ion Mg2+ is essential for proper 3′-OH processing and strand transfer activities as well as promoting structural changes in IN (1Brown P.O. Coffin J. Hughes S. Varmus H. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 161-203Google Scholar, 31Craigie R. Craig N. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Bethesda, MD2002: 613-630Google Scholar). At optimal AMV IN-DNA molar ratios, Mg2+ also assists in assembly of intasomes at 14 °C. With Mg2+ in the assembly mixtures, a typical IN titration profile for full-site integration was observed (Fig. 2). Without Mg2+ in the assembly mixture, the formation of full-site integration products was diminished ∼50% compared with that observed when Mg2+ was present (data not shown). The presence of Ca2+ (5 mm) in the assembly mixtures had no or a slightly detrimental effect on the yield of competent intasomes capable of full-site integration after addition of Mg2+ necessary to measure strand transfer activity. The results suggest that Mg2+ assists IN at low concentrations in assembling proper intasomes at 14 °C but it is not absolutely essential. AMV IN Does Not Form a Stable Association with Blunt-ended att Ends during Assembly at 14 °C—The majority of mature cytoplasmic retrovirus intasomes contain 3′-OH-recessed LTR ends suggesting the recessed termini are a stabilizing factor for intasomes prior to nuclear import and integration (2Fujiwara T. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1988; 54: 497-504Google Scholar, 5Lee Y.M. Coffin J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1419-1430Google Scholar, 7Brown H.E. Chen H. Engelman A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9011-9020Google Scholar). HIV-1 intasomes that have unprocessed blunt-ends on the viral DNA (because of att site mutations) lack an MM-PCR footprint (9Chen H. Engelman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6758-6767Google Scholar). Recombinant HIV-1 IN forms stable complexes with oligonucleotides possessing 3′-OH-recessed LTR ends for half-site strand transfer but not with the same substrate containing blunt-end LTR ends necessary for 3′-OH processing (32Ellison V. Brown P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7316-7320Google Scholar). Inhibitor studies also suggest that HIV-1 IN forms a unique “strand transfer” conformation upon binding to 3′-OH-recessed LTR ends in the presence of target DNA (33Hazuda D.J. Felock P. Witmer M. Wolfe A. Stillmock K. Grobler J.A. Espeseth A. Gabryelski L. Schleif W. Blau C. Miller M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 646-650Google Scholar, 34Espeseth A.S. Felock P. Wolfe A. Witmer M. Grobler J. Anthony N. Egbertson M. Melamed J.Y. Young S. Hamill T. Cole J.L. Hazuda D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11244-11249Google Scholar). We investigated if AMV IN forms a stable structure with blunt-ended LTR donor ends under assembly conditions at 14 °C as measured by DNase I footprint protection. To perform the coupled 3′-OH processing and protection studies, we filled-in the 3′-OH-recessed ends of the 4.5-kbp DNA containing gain-of-function (“G”) sequences at both the U3 and U5 ends (13Vora A. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3556-3567Google Scholar). After restriction digestion of the 4.5-kbp DNA, the 3.6-kbp donor DNA containing only the labeled blunt-ended G U5 end sequences was isolated (Table I). A series of three experiments were performed simultaneously with assembled IN-DNA complexes with the blunt-ended substrate. Assembly of DNA at various concentrations of IN was for 45 min at 14 °C (Fig. 3A). Aliquots from the assembly mixtures were taken at various times to measure activities at different temperatures. First, at 14 °C, minimal 3′-OH processing occurs in the assembly mixture even at 21 nm IN, but significant amounts of labeled dinucleotides are released by IN after 5 min incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 3A). Second, minimal strand transfer activity also occurred with the same blunt-ended DNA substrate upon incubation at 37 °C for only 5 min (Fig. 3B, lanes 6–10). Prolonged incubations at 37 °C (>30 min) with the blunt-ended donor primarily resulted in half-site products with a minor population of full-site integration products (23Vora A.C. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7483-7488Google Scholar). Third, no DNase I footprint protection by IN was observed on the blunt-ended DNA at 14 °C suggesting the lack of a stable association by IN under these assay conditions (Fig. 3C). Similarly, negative DNase I footprint protection by IN was obtained using a 3.6-kbp DNA containing either wt U3 or wt U5 blunt-ends that were extended by one nucleotide (Table I). In contrast, IN at the same concentrations and assay conditions using a 3′-OH-recessed donor was fully capable of significant full-site integration activity (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–5; lane 2 at 3 nm IN had 15% donor incorporated into full-site products at 37 °C in 5 min). The results suggest that IN does not form a stable complex with G U5 DNA with blunt-ends at 14 °C although these IN-DNA complexes mediate efficient 3′-OH processing at 37 °C. Taken together, the ∼20-bp DNase I footprints observed with 3′-OH-recessed viral DNA ends at 14 °C (13Vora A. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3556-3567Google Scholar, 14Chiu R. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6482-6492Google Scholar) and its correlation with full-site integration suggests that the stable strand transfer conformational structure of IN is different from what is associated with blunt-end viral DNA at 14 °C. DNase I Footprint Is Observed on G U3 att Sites but Not on Wild Type U5 at Low IN and NaCl Concentrations—We had previously shown that AMV IN was not able to produce a ∼20-bp DNase I footprint on wt U5 DNA possessing 3′-OH-recessed ends at 0.32 m NaCl in the assembly mixture at 14 °C even though the strand transfer activities appeared normal at 37 °C (13Vora A. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3556-3567Google Scholar). The possibility existed that IN was not stably associated with U5 at 0.32 m NaCl but could be at lower NaCl concentrations. A variety of new conditions were tested to determine whether IN was able to produce the ∼20-bp footprint on U5 at 14 °C. The NaCl concentrations were varied from 50 to 320 mm using different concentrations of IN (5–42 nm). The ∼20-bp footprints were not observed at the termini (data not shown). We also tested whether the presence of target facilitated the formation of stable IN-DNA complexes at 14 °C (33Hazuda D.J. Felock P. Witmer M. Wolfe A. Stillmock K. Grobler J.A. Espeseth A. Gabryelski L. Schleif W. Blau C. Miller M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 646-650Google Scholar, 34Espeseth A.S. Felock P. Wolfe A. Witmer M. Grobler J. Anthony N. Egbertson M. Melamed J.Y. Young S. Hamill T. Cole J.L. Hazuda D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11244-11249Google Scholar). We observed no DNase I footprints if, target DNA was added after 30 min of assembly time with U5 att DNA followed by 15 min of further incubation at 14 °C, prior to DNase I digestion. In contrast, we were able to demonstrate that IN at low concentrations produced the normally observed ∼20-bp DNase I footprint using G U3 att DNA containing 3′-OH-recessed ends at 50 and 100 mm NaCl (Fig. 4A). When IN was increased to 30 nm under these low salt conditions, the entire length of the DNA was essentially protected from DNase I digestion suggesting nonspecific multimerization of IN subunits on the DNA (data not shown). Aliquots of the same above samples (Fig. 4A) were analyzed for strand transfer activities at 37 °C for 5 min (Fig. 4B). Relatively higher quantities of all half-site products at 50 mm (Fig. 4B, lanes 2–4) or 100 mm NaCl (Fig. 4B, lanes 5–7) were observed than with IN at 0.32 m NaCl (Fig. 4B, lanes 8–10). The quantities of full-site products produced with 4 nm IN at 50, 100, and 320 mm NaCl were 22, 32, and 15% of the total donor incorporated (Fig. 4B, lanes 2, 5, and 8, respectively). The ratio of full-site to half-site integration products produced with the U3 att donor were effected by both IN and NaCl concentrations. In summary, the lack of the ∼20-bp footprint on the U5 att donor by IN was not apparently because of higher salt concentrations. DNase I Cleaves at Sensitive att Site Nine Nucleotides from the End Terminus in Suboptimal Assembled Intasomes—Physical interactions of IN with att site sequences suggest that the first ∼12 nucleotides from the end are functionally important for 3′-OH processing and strand transfer activities both in vivo and in vitro (31Craigie R. Craig N. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Bethesda, MD2002: 613-630Google Scholar, 35Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Google Scholar). Detailed MM-PCR footprinting of HIV-1 intasomes revealed the major area of enhancements at nucleotides 9 and 10 from the end on U3 and, nucleotides 11 and 13 nucleotides from the end on U5 (7Brown H.E. Chen H. Engelman A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9011-9020Google Scholar). We investigated whether probing of suboptimal assembled avian intasomes by DNase I would provide molecular insights into the contacts between IN and the viral att site near the terminus. Under normal assembly conditions at 14 °C and 45 min, complete DNase I protection by IN mapping up to ∼20 bp of att terminal sequences is observed with wt U3, G U3, or G U5 donors containing 3′-OH-recessed ends (Fig. 4) (Table I). The same footprints were observed on the 32P 5′-labeled wt U3 att donor in the presence of 2-fo"
