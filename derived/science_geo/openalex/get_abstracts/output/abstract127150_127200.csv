https://openalex.org/W2064864838,"Global anterograde amnesia is described in three patients with brain injuries that occurred in one case at birth, in another by age 4, and in the third at age 9. Magnetic resonance techniques revealed bilateral hippocampal pathology in all three cases. Remarkably, despite their pronounced amnesia for the episodes of everyday life, all three patients attended mainstream schools and attained levels of speech and language competence, literacy, and factual knowledge that are within the low average to average range. The findings provide support for the view that the episodic and semantic components of cognitive memory are partly dissociable, with only the episodic component being fully dependent on the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W1992864103,"The three-dimensional structure of the complex between human H-Ras bound to guanosine diphosphate and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating domain of the human GTPase-activating protein p120GAP (GAP-334) in the presence of aluminum fluoride was solved at a resolution of 2.5 angstroms. The structure shows the partly hydrophilic and partly hydrophobic nature of the communication between the two molecules, which explains the sensitivity of the interaction toward both salts and lipids. An arginine side chain (arginine-789) of GAP-334 is supplied into the active site of Ras to neutralize developing charges in the transition state. The switch II region of Ras is stabilized by GAP-334, thus allowing glutamine-61 of Ras, mutation of which activates the oncogenic potential, to participate in catalysis. The structural arrangement in the active site is consistent with a mostly associative mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and provides an explanation for the activation of Ras by glycine-12 and glutamine-61 mutations. Glycine-12 in the transition state mimic is within van der Waals distance of both arginine-789 of GAP-334 and glutamine-61 of Ras, and even its mutation to alanine would disturb the arrangements of residues in the transition state."
https://openalex.org/W2161641464,"Proteins of the Bcl-2 family are intracellular membrane-associated proteins that regulate programmed cell death (apoptosis) either positively or negatively by as yet unknown mechanisms. Bax, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, was shown to form channels in lipid membranes. Bax triggered the release of liposome-encapsulated carboxyfluorescein at both neutral and acidic pH. At physiological pH, release could be blocked by Bcl-2. Bcl-2, in contrast, triggered carboxyfluorescein release at acidic pH only. In planar lipid bilayers, Bax formed pH- and voltage-dependent ion-conducting channels. Thus, the pro-apoptotic effects of Bax may be elicited through an intrinsic pore-forming activity that can be antagonized by Bcl-2."

https://openalex.org/W2004060523,"CD1 represents a third lineage of antigen-presenting molecules that are distantly related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in the immune system. The crystal structure of mouse CD1d1, corresponding to human CD1d, at 2.8 Å resolution shows that CD1 adopts an MHC fold that is more closely related to that of MHC class I than to that of MHC class II. The binding groove, although significantly narrower, is substantially larger because of increased depth and it has only two major pockets that are almost completely hydrophobic. The extreme hydrophobicity and shape of the binding site are consistent with observations that human CD1b and CD1c can present mycobacterial cell wall antigens, such as mycolic acid and lipoarabinomannans. However, mouse CD1d1 can present very hydrophobic peptides, but must do so in a very different way from MHC class Ia and class II molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1998418805,"Cell divisions that produce progeny differing in their patterns of gene expression are key to the development of multicellular organisms. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mother cells but not daughter cells can switch mating type because they selectively express the HO endonuclease gene. This asymmetry is due to the preferential accumulation of an unstable transcriptional repressor protein, Ash1p, in daughter cell nuclei. Here it is shown that ASH1 messenger RNA (mRNA) preferentially accumulates in daughter cells by a process that is dependent on actin and myosin. A cis-acting element in the 3'-untranslated region of ASH1 mRNA is sufficient to localize a chimeric RNA to daughter cells. These results suggest that localization of mRNA may have been an early property of the eukaryotic lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2035504758,"Mutations in the gene encoding copper/zinc superoxide dismutase enzyme produce an animal model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), a fatal disorder characterized by paralysis. Overexpression of the proto-oncogene bcl-2 delayed onset of motor neuron disease and prolonged survival in transgenic mice expressing the FALS-linked mutation in which glycine is substituted by alanine at position 93. It did not, however, alter the duration of the disease. Overexpression of bcl-2 also attenuated the magnitude of spinal cord motor neuron degeneration in the FALS-transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2012040490,"Transport of membrane proteins between intracellular compartments requires specific sequences in the protein cytoplasmic domain to direct packaging into vesicle shuttles. A sequence that mediates export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has proved elusive. A di-acidic signal (Asp-X-Glu, where X represents any amino acid) on the cytoplasmic tail of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) and other cargo molecules was required for efficient recruitment to vesicles mediating export from the ER in baby hamster kidney cells. The existence of such a signal provides evidence that export from the ER occurs through a selective mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2058876174,"Most cases of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) are caused by mutations in the genes encoding the presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 proteins, both of which undergo regulated endoproteolytic processing. During apoptosis, PS1 and PS2 were shown to be cleaved at sites distal to their normal cleavage sites by a caspase-3 family protease. In cells expressing PS2 containing the asparagine-141 FAD mutant, the ratio of alternative to normal PS2 cleavage fragments was increased relative to wild-type PS2-expressing cells, suggesting a potential role for apoptosis-associated cleavage of presenilins in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1990827407,"C-peptide, a cleavage product from the processing of proinsulin to insulin, has been considered to possess little if any biological activity other than its participation in insulin synthesis. Injection of human C-peptide prevented or attenuated vascular and neural (electrophysiological) dysfunction and impaired Na + - and K + -dependent adenosine triphosphate activity in tissues of diabetic rats. Nonpolar amino acids in the midportion of the peptide were required for these biological effects. Synthetic reverse sequence (retro) and all– d –amino acid (enantio) C-peptides were equipotent to native C-peptide, which indicates that the effects of C-peptide on diabetic vascular and neural dysfunction were mediated by nonchiral interactions instead of stereospecific receptors or binding sites."

https://openalex.org/W2118484018,"A genetic block was introduced in the first condensation step of the polyketide biosynthetic pathway that leads to the formation of 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-dEB), the macrocyclic precursor of erythromycin. Exogenous addition of designed synthetic molecules to small-scale cultures of this null mutant resulted in highly selective multimilligram production of unnatural polyketides, including aromatic and ring-expanded variants of 6-dEB. Unexpected incorporation patterns were observed, illustrating the catalytic versatility of modular polyketide synthases. Further processing of some of these scaffolds by postpolyketide enzymes of the erythromycin pathway resulted in the generation of novel antibacterials with in vitro potency comparable to that of their natural counterparts."

https://openalex.org/W1971478983,"The yeast cytoplasmically inherited genetic determinant [ PSI + ] is presumed to be a manifestation of the prion-like properties of the Sup35 protein (Sup35p). Here, cell-free conversion of Sup35p from [ psi − ] cells (Sup35p psi − ) to the prion-like [ PSI + ]-specific form (Sup35p PSI + ) was observed. The conversion reaction could be repeated for several consecutive cycles, thus modeling in vitro continuous [ PSI + ] propagation. Size fractionation of lysates of [ PSI + ] cells demonstrated that the converting activity was associated solely with Sup35p PSI + aggregates, which agrees with the nucleation model for [ PSI + ] propagation. Sup35p PSI + was purified and showed high conversion activity, thus confirming the prion hypothesis for Sup35p."
https://openalex.org/W2319190863,"The Microphthalmia basic-Helix-Loop-Helix-Leucine Zipper (bHLH-LZ) transcription factor (Mi) plays a crucial role in the genesis of melanocytes; mice deficient for a functional (Microphthalmia) gene product lack all pigment cells. We show here that the Mi activation domain resides N-terminal to the DNA-binding domain and that as little as 18 amino acids are sufficient to mediate transcription activation. The minimal activation region of Mi is highly conserved in the related transcription factor TFE3 and is predicted to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation. This region of Mi is also highly conserved with a region of E1A known to be essential for binding the CBP/p300 transcription cofactor. Consistent with these observations, the Mi activation domain can interact in vitro with CBP specifically through a region of CBP required for complex formation with E1A, P/CAF and c-Fos, and anti p300 antibodies can co-immunoprecipitate Mi from both melanocyte and melanoma cell lines. In addition, co-transfection of a vector expressing CBP2 (aas 1621-1891) fused to the VP16 activation domain potentiated the ability of Mi to activate transcription, confirming the significance of the CBP-Mi interaction observed in vitro. These data suggest that transcription activation by Mi is achieved at least in part by recruitment of CBP. The parallels between transcription regulation by Microphthalmia in melanocytes and MyoD in muscle cells are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1993262260,"The mycobacterial lipoglycans, lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), are potent immunomodulators in tuberculosis and leprosy. Little is known of their biosynthesis, other than being based on phosphatidylinositol (PI), and they probably originate in the phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs; PIMans). A novel form of cell-free incubation involving in vitro andin situ labeling with GDP-[14C]Man of the polyprenyl-P-mannoses (C35/C50-P-Man) and the simpler PIMs of mycobacterial membranes, reisolation of the [14C]Man-labeled membranes, and in situ chase demonstrated the synthesis of a novel α(1→6)-linked linear form of LM at the expense of the C35/C50-P-Man. There was little or no synthesis under these conditions of PIMan5with its terminal α(1→2)Man unit or the mature LM or LAM with copious α(1→2)Man branching. Synthesis of the linear LM, but not of the simpler PIMan2, was susceptible to amphomycin, a lipopeptide antibiotic that specifically inhibits polyprenyl-P-requiring translocases. A mixture of P[3H]I and P[3H]IMan2 was incorporated into the linear LM, supporting other evidence that, like the PIMs, LM and LAM, it is a lipid-linked mannooligosaccharide and a new member of the mycobacterial glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipoglycan/glycolipid class. Hence, the simpler PIMs originate in PI and GDP-Man, but further growth of the linear backbone emanates from C35-/C50-P-Man and is amphomycin-sensitive. The origin of the α(1→2)Man branches of mature PIMan5, LM, and LAM is not known at this time but is probably GDP-Man.

The cell wall of Mycobacterium spp. consists of a core composed of peptidoglycan linked to the heteropolysaccharide arabinogalactan which, in turn, is attached to the mycolic acids (1Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar). Complementing the mycolyl residues is a variety of free lipids, and interspersed in this framework are lipoarabinomannan (LAM), 1The abbreviations used are: LAM, lipoarabinomannan; LM, lipomannan; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIMs/PIMans, phosphatidylinositol mannosides; PIMan2, phosphatidylinositol dimannoside; Ac1PIMan2, monoacylphosphatidylinositol dimannoside; Ac2PIMan2, diacylphosphatidylinositol dimannoside; PIMan5, phosphatidylinositol pentamannoside; Ino, inositol; Dol-P-Man, dolichyl-P-Man; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: LAM, lipoarabinomannan; LM, lipomannan; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIMs/PIMans, phosphatidylinositol mannosides; PIMan2, phosphatidylinositol dimannoside; Ac1PIMan2, monoacylphosphatidylinositol dimannoside; Ac2PIMan2, diacylphosphatidylinositol dimannoside; PIMan5, phosphatidylinositol pentamannoside; Ino, inositol; Dol-P-Man, dolichyl-P-Man; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. lipomannan (LM), and various proteins (1Brennan P.J.

LAM has emerged as a major modulator of the host immune response in the course of tuberculosis and leprosy, through generalized suppression of immunity (2Sibley L.D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Krahenbuhl J.L. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1232-1236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), induction of inflammatory cytokines (3Roach T.I.A. Barton C.H. Chatterjee D. Blackwell J.M. J.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 4070-4079PubMed Google Scholar). The biological importance of LAM dictates an understanding of its biosynthesis. Both LM and LAM are based on phosphatidylinositol (PI) (6Hunter S.W. Gaylord H. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12345-12351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hunter S.W.

LAM contains an additional arabinan, similar but not identical to the arabinan of arabinogalactan (13Chatterjee D. Bozic C.M. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol.

The structural progression from PI to PIMan2 to Ac1PIMan2 to LM and LAM has suggested a similar biosynthetic order (8Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6228-6233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, to date, this was mere speculation. In this present study, we have defined the origins of the Man units of the PIMs and LM and, in the course of the work, identified an α1→6-linked linear form of LM, the apparent precursor of mature LM and LAM. The transformable strain of Mycobacterium smegmatis, mc2155 (15Mikušová K. Mikuö M. Besra G.S. Hancock I. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7820-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), was grown in Bacto Nutrient broth (Difco Labs, Detroit, MI) to mid-log phase (about 24 h), harvested, washed with physiological saline, and stored at −20 °C.M. tuberculosis H37Ra (ATCC 25177) was grown in a liquid medium containing glycerol, alanine, and salts (16Takayama K. Schnoes H.K. Armstrong E.L. Boyle R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1975; 16: 308-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 14–16 days before harvesting. Mycobacteria (20 g, wet weight) were first washed and then resuspended at 4 °C in a buffer (20 ml) containing 50 mm MOPS (adjusted to pH 7.9 with KOH), 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2 (buffer A), 150 μg of DNase I (type IV, Sigma), and 250 μg of RNase (microsomal nuclease (Sigma)) and subjected to five passes through a French pressure cell (Aminco, Silver Spring, MD) at 10,000 p.s.i. The preparation was centrifuged initially at 600 × g to remove large particles and then at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the membranes were obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. These (i.e. membranes arising from 20 g wet weight of cells) were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A or buffer B (0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), containing 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm EDTA-Na2) (17Rush J.S. Shelling J.G. Zingg N.S. Ray P.H. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13110-13117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) to yield a total of ∼20 mg of protein that was frozen in small aliquots; the enzyme activity in membranes was slightly diminished (∼20%) by prolonged (2 months) storage at −20 °C. The pellet from the 27,000 ×g centrifugation was resuspended in 7 ml of buffer A (20 mg protein/ml) or occasionally in the same volume of buffer B and used directly as an enzymatically active cell envelope fraction containing both cell walls and some membranes; the enzyme activity of this preparation was unaffected by prolonged storage (2 months) in small aliquots at −20 °C. Alternatively, the 27,000 × gpellet was resuspended in 40 ml of buffer A divided equally among four 40-ml centrifuge tubes to which were added 15 ml of Percoll (Pharmacia, Sweden) and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C (18Lee R.E. Mikušová K. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 11829-11832Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The particulate, upper diffuse band, containing both cell walls and membranes, was removed, collected by centrifugation, washed three times in buffer A, and finally resuspended in 4 ml of buffer A. The final concentration of this Percoll-60-purified cell envelope fraction (P-60) was 8–10 mg of protein/ml. Over 80% of the enzyme activity was lost on freezing and thawing, and hence, this fraction was freshly prepared. Early assays involved incubation of membranes (50 μl; 0.5 mg of protein) or cell envelope (50 μl; 1 mg of protein) in either buffer A or B in the presence of 10 μmMgCl2 and 10 μm (5 μCi) GDP-[2-3H]Man (35 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in a total volume of 100 μl. Subsequent assays involved incubation of membranes (100 μl; 2 mg of protein) in buffer A with 9.7 μm (1 μCi) GDP-[U-14C]Man (321.4 mCi/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and 62.5 μm ATP in a total volume of 320 μl. Enzymatically active membranes containing in situ [14C]Man-labeled lipids, generated as a result of a 10-min pulse incubation with GDP-[14C]Man, were recovered by centrifugation of combined multiple reaction mixtures (either 10 or 20) at 100,000 × g, for 60 min. The supernatants from these centrifugations were removed, and the [14C]Man-labeled membranes were washed in place several times with cold buffer A to remove residual GDP-[14C]Man. The [14C]Man-labeled membranes were then carefully resuspended in buffer A (e.g. 1.0 ml for the proceeds from 10 replicate reactions), and 100-μl aliquots (2 mg of protein) were then redistributed into 10 fresh tubes, each containing 62.5 μm ATP and usually 2 mg (200 μl) of the Percoll-purified cell envelope (P-60) in a total volume of 320 μl and incubated further. Amphomycin (calcium salt) was a gift to C. J. Waechter from Bristol Laboratories and R. Bedensky, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH. The lipopeptide (up to 2 mg) was dissolved in 500 μl of 0.1 nacetic acid, and the solution was adjusted to 0.05 m sodium acetate (pH 7.0) with 0.1 n NaOH for a final concentration of 2 mg/ml (19Banerjee D.K. Scher M.G. Waechter C.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1561-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Membranes with or without the in situlabeled [14C]Man lipids were preincubated with amphomycin (10 μg/100 μl of reaction mixture) at 37 °C for 10 min prior to various manipulations such as the addition of the P-60-purified cell envelope fraction and further incubation. At the end of incubations, the reactions were terminated by the addition of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) (2.5 ml per 100 μl of reaction mixture) followed by centrifugation to separate the pellet (17Rush J.S.

Chem. 1975; 250: 1992-2002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was extracted once more with one-half the volume of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). The combined CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) extracts were washed with 0.9% NaCl followed by CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:48:47) to yield the washed CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) lipids. The resulting insoluble pellet, in the case of reactions involving membranes with in situ labeled [14C]Man lipids, was directly extracted twice with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3). The insoluble pellets derived from membranes that were directly labeled with GDP-[3H]Man or GDP-[14C]Man were first washed with 0.9% NaCl in CH3OH, H2O/CH3OH (1:1) and pure CH3OH (17Rush J.S. Shelling J.G. Zingg N.S. Ray P.H. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13110-13117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to remove residual GDP-[14C]Man before extracting with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3). In an effort to determine whether the insoluble [14C]Man-containing products associated with the final insoluble residue were LM/LAM, it was successively extracted with refluxing 50% ethanol and 88% phenol, as described (7Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9272-9279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the various PIMs followed earlier work (9Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J.

Bloom B.R. Tuberculosis: Pathogenesis, Protection and Control. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 285-306Google Scholar). Thus, characterizations were based on fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy analysis (9Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and chromatographic patterns of the intact PIMs (23Brennan P. Ballou C.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1968; 243: 2975-2984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the deacylated forms (21Lee Y.C. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), e.g. the deacylated PIMan2s produced a single product with anR f compared with deacylated PI of 0.8 on paper chromatograms in 2-propyl alcohol/NH4OH (2:1), whereas the deacylated PIMan5s produced a single product with a comparative R f of 0.30. To prepare P[3H]I and P[3H]IMan2s,M. smegmatis was grown in 100 ml of the glycerol/alanine/salts medium to mid-log phase (24 h) at which stage 250 μCi of [2-3H]myo-inositol (21 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) was added to the medium and growth continued for another 12 h to late-log phase. Cells were harvested aseptically, and the recovered medium was re-inoculated with freshM. smegmatis and the cycle repeated. The combined harvested cells were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline, lyophilized (184 mg), extracted several times with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1), the extracts washed (25Folch J. Lees M.

Two-dimensional TLC, first in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (60:30:6) and then in CHCl3/CH3COOH/CH3OH/H2O (40:25:3:6), followed by treatment with EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products), and autoradiography demonstrated the presence of mostly P[3H]I and Ac2P[3H]IMan2 with small amounts of P[3H]IMan1 and P[3H]IMan2. To examine the incorporation of the P[3H]I and P[3H]Man2s into the linear LM, the dry preparation containing them was suspended by sonication in buffer A, and 500,000 cpm aliquots were added to each of five standard reaction mixtures (320 μl) containing membranes (8 mg), ATP, P-60 and buffer, which were incubated for 1 h, extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) followed by CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3). Conditions for the preparation of the P[3H]IMan5s and PI[14C]Man5s from growing cells labeled with [3H]Ino and [14C]Glc, respectively, are described in the figure legends. This study resulted in an excellent protocol for the selective purification of the PIMan5s. We had observed that little of the PIMan5s (21Lee Y.C. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1395-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were present in the CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) extracts of M. smegmatis. However, extraction of the resulting residue (from 40 g wet weight of cells) three times with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3) resulted in 30.7 mg of material. Two-dimensional TLC, first in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (60:30:6) and then in CHCl3/CH3COOH/CH3OH/H2O (40:25:3:6), followed by staining with an α-naphthol-containing reagent (26Slakotos A.N. Rouse G. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1965; 42: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), demonstrated the presence only of the two PIMan5s, PIMan5 and AcPIMan5(27Pangborn M.C. McKinney J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 627-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TLC was conducted in one- and two-dimensions on aluminum-backed plates of silica gel 60 F254 (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in the solvents described in the text. An α-naphthol spray (26Slakotos A.N. Rouse G. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1965; 42: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and the molybdenum blue (28Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) dip reagent were used to detect carbohydrate and phosphorus in lipids, respectively. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver periodic acid-Schiff staining was performed as described (29Prinzis S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing chromatograms to Kodak X-Omat AR films at −70 °C, usually for 4–5 days. To locate3H-labeled products, EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products) was used according to instructions. Plates were also scanned for radioactivity using the Bio-Scan System 200 Imaging Scanner with the Autochanger 3000 (plates were read stepwise, using the 10-mm collimator, in 3-mm stops, each stop reading for 15 min). Mild acid hydrolysis of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1)-soluble lipids was conducted in 0.5 n HCl tetrahydrofuran (1:4) for 2 h at 50 °C (30Robbins P.W. Krag S.S. Liu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1780-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were neutralized with 200 μl of 0.1 n NaOH in 0.02n sodium phosphate, dried, resuspended in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (4:2:1), centrifuged, and the aqueous and organic phases separated and analyzed. For mild acid hydrolysis of the CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3)-soluble lipids, samples (∼100 μg) were suspended in 50 μl of 1-propyl alcohol, sonicated, treated with 100 μl of 0.02 n HCl at 60 °C for 30 min, neutralized with 15 μl of 0.2 n NaOH (20Lucas J.J. Waechter C.J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1992-2002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Turco S.J. Wilkerson M.A. Clawson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3883-3889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and subjected to gel filtration chromatography. For mild alkaline hydrolysis of both sets of lipids, samples were dissolved or suspended in 900 μl of ethanol by sonication, followed by the addition of 100 μl of 1 n NaOH and incubation at 40 °C for 1 h. The NaOH was neutralized with ethyl formate (∼144 μl), held at 40 °C for 5 min, and dried. In the case of the CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1)-soluble lipids, the products were partitioned within CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (4:2:1) and analyzed separately. The products from the CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3)-soluble lipids were not partitioned but were applied directly to columns. Gel filtration chromatography was conducted on columns (1 × 116–175 cm) of various Bio-Gel P resins (Bio-Rad) in 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 6.5). Repeated efforts to fully methylate the linear LM by the NaOH method (32Dell A. Reason A.-J. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. Successful methylation was accomplished by the method of Hakomori (33Hakomori S.I. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1964; 55: 205-208PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications, particularly the additions of fresh CH3I and 4.8m dimethyl sulfinyl carbanion. The final reaction mixture was applied to a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA) and the permethylated linear LM recovered in the CH3CN eluant as determined by counting 1% of the eluants. The per-O-methylated linear LM was hydrolyzed in 2 mtrifluoroacetic acid at 110 °C for 2 h, the acid evaporated, reduced with NaBH4, per-O-acetylated, and the alditol acetate characterized by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as described (34Besra G.S. Khoo K.-H. McNeil M.R. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4257-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The immediate question was the manner of biosynthesis of LM with a view to ultimate LAM synthesis. Work in the late 1960s provided possible clues. Brennan and Ballou (23Brennan P. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3046-3056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Brennan P. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2975-2984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Ballou (35Ballou C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 493-500Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) demonstrated that membranes from M. smegmatiscatalyzed the transfer of [14C]Man from GDP-[14C]Man to PI to produce PI[14C]Man2 with the further addition of palmitate residues from palmitolyl-CoA to yield a mixture of PIMan2, the monoacyl (Ac1PIMan2) and the diacyl (Ac2PIMan2) derivatives. It was later recognized that LAM, in its various forms, i.e. ManLAM and AraLAM (22Besra G.S. Chatterjee D. Bloom B.R. Tuberculosis: Pathogenesis, Protection and Control. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 285-306Google Scholar), and LM contain a mannan core linked to PI similar to that in the family of PIMs (PIMan1–6) (6Hunter S.W. Gaylord H. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12345-12351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6228-6233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, it was shown that these lipoglycans contain thed-myo-inositol 2,6-bis-α-Manp unit and thus to be based on PIMan2, and hence, it was assumed that PIMan2 (and probably PIMan3) was the immediate precursor of LM/LAM. Moreover, since Khoo et al. (9Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of a palmitate substituent on C-6 of the Manp unit that is linked directly to C-2 of the Ino within LM/LAM, it was further assumed that Ac1PIMan2was the precise precursor. Throughout, it was thought that GDP-Man was the immediate donor of all of the Manp units of LM/LAM simply because it was the demonstrated precursor of the Manpunits of the PIMan2 family (23Brennan P. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3046-3056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Brennan P. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2975-2984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, shortly after this initial work, Takayama et al. (36Takayama K. Armstrong E.L. FEBS Lett. 1971; 18: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 37Takayama K. Schnoes H.K. Semmler E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 136: 217-221Google Scholar) and Schultz and Elbein (38Schultz J. Elbein A.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 160: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) described two alkali-stable mannophospholipids in M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis, a mannosyl-1-phosphoryl-decaprenol (C50-P-Man) and a mannosyl-1-phosphoryl heptaprenol (C35-P-Man), which, in light of their group transfer potential and known role in mannolipid synthesis from other organisms (39Adamany A.M. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2842-2854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could be donors of polymerized Man in mycobacterial cell walls. Indeed, Schultz and co-workers (38Schultz J. Elbein A.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 160: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 40Schultz J.C. Takayama K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 381: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) demonstrated indirectly that C50/C35-P-Man was the Man donor of undefined polymers. In addition, more recently, Yokoyama and Ballou (41Yokoyama K. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21621-21628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the β-mannosylphosphoryldecaprenol (C50-P-βMan) was the direct Man donor of a series of α(1→6)-linked oligosaccharides, clearly not LM or LAM with their copious α(1→2) branches. Hence, the questions posed at the outset of this work concerned the metabolic relationships among GDP-Man, C35/C50-P-Man, the PIMs, LM/LAM, and the connection, if any, between the α(1→6)-linked mannooligosaccharides and LM/LAM. A variety of incubation conditions was applied as follows: those developed in the context of PIM biosynthesis (23Brennan P. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3046-3056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Brennan P. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2975-2984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); those (17Rush J.S. Shelling J.G. Zingg N.S. Ray P.H. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13110-13117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) designed to examine the specificity of dolichyl-P-Man-dependent mannosyltransferase activity in mammalian glycoprotein synthesis; those for the incorporation of Man from GDP-Man and C50-P-βMan into the α(1→6)-linked oligosaccharides of M. smegmatis (41Yokoyama K. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21621-21628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and a more universal assay appropriate for the incorporation of [14C]GlcNAc, [14C]Rha, [14C]Gal, and [14C]Ara from their corresponding donors into the mycobacterial cell wall “core” (15Mikušová K.

Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 11829-11832Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Incorporation in all cases was quantitatively and qualitatively comparable. However, replacement of 10 mm MgCl2(17Rush J.S. Shelling J.G. Zingg N.S. Ray P.H. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13110-13117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 10 mm MnCl2 or 10 mmCaCl2 resulted in about 35% reduction of activity but no change in product profile; inclusion of 5 mm EDTA reduced incorporation by about 90%, pointing to the need for divalent cations for these mannosyltransferase activities. Under all of these conditions, the majority (∼89%; ∼0.4 × 106 cpm/mg protein/reaction mixture) of the incorporated [3H]Man was present in the CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1)-soluble membrane lipids with only about 10% in other material (Table I). Substitution of membranes with active cell envelope preparations resulted in lower specific activity, but still ∼80% of the incorporated [3H]Man appeared in the membrane lipids. Obviously, under these conditions, there was little or no synthesis of LM/LAM or large mannooligosaccharides which are not extracted by those solvents and would be in the insoluble residue. TLC autoradiography (see below) of the lipids synthesized by membranes and cell envelope preparations showed no significant differences in profile; about 75% of the total radioactivity was distributed between C50-P-Man and C35-P-Man, with the remainder in the PIMan2s. Short pulses (10 min) of membranes with GDP-[3H]/[14C]Man showed lesser synthesis of the PIMan2s; the C35-P-Man and C50-P-Man predominated. Longer incubations showed increased synthesis of the PIMan2s.Table IIncorporation of [3 H]Man from GDP-[3 H]Man into mycobacterial membrane or envelope mannolipidsFractionMembranesEnvelopeNature of productscpm/assaycpm/assayCHCl/CH3OH (2:1)-soluble lipids0.41 × 106 (89%)0.172 × 106 (83%)C35/C50–P-Man; PIMan2sCHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3)-soluble lipids0.01 × 106 (2%)0.017 × 106 (8%)NondescriptInsoluble residue0.04 × 106 (9%)0.019 × 106 (9%)—Reaction mixtures contained 10 mm MgCl2, 1.0 × 106 cpm (10 μm) GDP-[2-3H]Man, membranes from M. smegmatis (100,000 × gpellet; 0.52 mg of protein) or cell envelope from M. smegmatis (27,000 × g pellet; 1.02 mg of protein) (50 μl) in buffer A in a total volume of 100 μl.

https://openalex.org/W2032091621,"The Galileo spacecraft performed six radio occultation observations of Jupiter's Galilean satellite Europa during its tour of the jovian system. In five of the six instances, these occultations revealed the presence of a tenuous ionosphere on Europa, with an average maximum electron density of nearly 10 4 per cubic centimeter near the surface and a plasma scale height of about 240 ± 40 kilometers from the surface to 300 kilometers and of 440 ± 60 kilometers above 300 kilometers. Such an ionosphere could be produced by solar photoionization and jovian magnetospheric particle impact in an atmosphere having a surface density of about 10 8 electrons per cubic centimeter. If this atmosphere is composed primarily of O 2 , then the principal ion is O 2 + and the neutral atmosphere temperature implied by the 240-kilometer scale height is about 600 kelvin. If it is composed of H 2 O, the principal ion is H 3 O + and the neutral temperature is about 340 kelvin. In either case, these temperatures are much higher than those observed on Europa's surface, and an external heating source from the jovian magnetosphere is required."
https://openalex.org/W2069156525,"The gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF) is a newly identified transcription factor that contains three C2H2 Krüppel-type zinc fingers. Previous immunocytochemical studies indicate that GKLF is exclusively localized to the nucleus. To identify the nuclear localization signal (NLS) within GKLF, cDNA constructs with various deletions in the coding region of GKLF were generated and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence in transfected COS-1 cells. In addition, constructs fusing regions representing putative NLSs of GKLF to green fluorescent protein (GFP) were generated and examined by fluorescence microscopy in similarly transfected cells. The results indicate that GKLF contains two potent, independent NLSs: one within the zinc fingers and the other in a cluster of basic amino acids (called 5′ basic region) immediately preceding the first zinc finger. In comparison, putative NLSs within the zinc fingers and the 5′ basic region of a related Krüppel protein, zif268/Egr-1, are relatively less efficient in their ability to translocate GFP into the nucleus. A search in the protein sequence data base revealed that despite the existence of numerous Krüppel proteins, only two, the lung Krüppel-like factor (LKLF) and the erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF), exhibit similar NLSs to those of GKLF. These findings indicate that GKLF, LKLF, and EKLF are members of a subfamily of closely related Krüppel proteins.

These findings indicate that GKLF, LKLF, and EKLF are members of a subfamily of closely related Krüppel proteins. Various mechanisms that are responsible for nuclear localization of eukaryotic transcription factors have been proposed. Most transcription factors contain one or more nuclear localization signal (NLS), 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; BKLF, basic Krüppel-like factor; BTEB2, basic transcription element binding protein 2; EKLF, erythroid Krüppel-like factor; EZF, epithelial zinc finger; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GKLF, gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor; LKLF, lung Krüppel-like factor; aa, amino acid(s). which, when recognized by nuclear transport proteins, results in the translocation of the transcription factor to the nuclear pore complex. Subsequent translocation across the nuclear membrane occurs in an ATP-dependent fashion (1Richardson W.D. Mills A.D. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1988; 50: 655-664Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (374) Google Scholar). By inspecting the amino acid sequences of a large number of transcription factors, two types of NLSs have been defined (2Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 193-227PubMed Google Scholar, 3Boulikas T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 55: 32-58Google Scholar). The first type, called a “core” NLS, contains four or more arginine and lysine residues within a hexapeptide and is frequently flanked by acidic residues or “helix-breakers” such as proline and glycine (3Boulikas T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 55: 32-58Google Scholar). The second type of NLS is “bipartite” and consists of two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a short nonbasic peptide. It is hypothesized that the two clusters of basic amino acids in a bipartite NLS are brought to a juxtaposed position due to protein folding and are subsequently recognized by the nuclear import machinery (2Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 193-227PubMed Google Scholar). In an analysis of the sequences of 117 transcription factors, 106 were found to contain one or more core NLS, whereas relatively few contain a bipartite NLS (2Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 193-227PubMed Google Scholar, 3Boulikas T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 55: 32-58Google Scholar). Interestingly, many putative NLSs are present in close proximity to the DNA-binding domains of transcription factors, exemplified by the bZIP proteins c-Fos and c-Jun, and the bHLH proteins Myc, Max, and Myo D1 (3Boulikas T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 55: 32-58Google Scholar). This conserved arrangement seems to suggest that DNA-binding motifs and nuclear localization signals may have coevolved. We recently identified a novel transcription factor named gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF) which contains three C2H2 Krüppel-type zinc fingers (5Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Expression of GKLF is enriched in the intestinal tract with the highest level of transcript found in the post-mitotic epithelial cells of the colon. In vitro, expression of GKLFis increased in culture conditions that induce growth arrest such as serum deprivation or contact inhibition. Furthermore, enforced expression of GKLF in transfected cells results in the inhibition of DNA synthesis. Together, these results indicate thatGKLF is a growth arrest-associated, epithelial-specific gene. Subsequently, GKLF was independently identified by another group, which named it epithelial zinc finger (EZF), and shown also to be expressed at high levels in the epidermal layers of the skin (6Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that GKLF/EZF may be involved in growth regulation and perhaps terminal differentiation of specific epithelial tissues. The primary amino acid sequence in the zinc finger region of GKLF exhibits a high degree of identity with several previously identified Krüppel proteins, including lung Krüppel-like factor (LKLF (7Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.S. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar)), erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF (8Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar)), and basic transcription element-binding protein 2 (BTEB2 (9Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar)). Because of the highly homologous nature of the zinc finger sequences of LKLF, EKLF, and BTEB2, it has been proposed that the three belong to the same multigene family (7Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.S. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that GKLF localized exclusively to the nucleus of cells transfected with a GKLF-expressing plasmid construct (5Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). To further investigate the structure-function relationship of GKLF with regard to nuclear localization, we determined its NLS in the present study. We show that GKLF contains two potent NLSs, each of which is sufficient to direct GKLF or an unrelated polypeptide into the nucleus. One of the NLSs resides in the zinc fingers and the other in a region (called 5′ basic region) immediately amino-terminal to the first zinc finger. In contrast, by our studies and previous reports, nuclear localization of a related Krüppel protein, zif268/Egr-1, appears to require the participation of both the 5′ basic region and the zinc fingers (4Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the Krüppel family of transcription factors can further be divided into subfamilies based on the sequences required for nuclear localization. A GKLF cDNA containing the entire 483 amino acid (aa) open reading frame cloned into the mammalian expression vector, PMT3 (11Swick A.G. Janicot M. Cheneval-Kastelic T. McLenithan J.C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Three mutant constructs with progressive deletions from the 3′ end of the GKLF coding region were generated by digesting the full-length cDNA with appropriate restriction endonculeases (Fig. 1 a). PMT3-GKLF-(1–441) contains the 5′ basic region (broadly defined as the 20 amino acids (residues 382–401) immediately preceding the first cysteine of the first zinc finger of GKLF) and a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 1½ zinc fingers. PMT3-GKLF-(1–401) contains the 5′ basic region and a deletion of all three zinc fingers. PMT3-GKLF-(1–349) contains a deletion of both the 5′ basic region and the zinc fingers. In addition, a construct containing only the 5′ basic region and the three zinc fingers of GKLF was generated (PMT3-GKLF-(350–483)). All green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins were generated in the expression vector, pEGFP-C3 (ClontechLaboratories, Inc.). cDNAs corresponding to peptides of those shown in Fig. 2 a were generated by the polymerase chain reaction using appropriate primers and fused to the carboxyl terminus of GFP. All constructs were sequenced to ensure the accuracy of the reading frames and to verify the fidelity of the polymerase chain reaction. Transient transfections were performed in COS-1 cells by lipofection (Life Technology, Inc.) as described previously (5Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The procedure for indirect immunofluorescence analysis of GKLF in transfected cells using a primary polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against GKLF and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit serum has also been described (5Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). For visualization of cells transfected with the GFP fusion constructs, cells were fixed and permeabilized in an identical manner to those described for indirect immunofluorescence (5Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop 20 microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Nuclear localization of GKLF was first examined by indirect immunofluorescence of COS-1 cells that had been transiently transfected with the full-length or various deletion constructs of GKLF in PMT3. Fig. 1 shows the results of one such experiment, which is representative of three independent experiments performed. The expressed GKLF protein was found to be present in the nucleus of cells transfected with constructs that retained the 5′ basic region of GKLF (constructs A, B, C, and E (Fig. 1)). In contrast, deletion of the 5′ basic region resulted in a significant distribution of the protein to the cytoplasm (construct D(Fig. 1)). Cells transfected with the empty PMT3 vector showed only minimal background staining (construct F (Fig. 1)). These results indicate that the 5′ basic region of GKLF is both necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization. To further delineate the NLS of GKLF, DNA constructs fusing various regions of GKLF to the carboxyl terminus of GFP were generated and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. As seen in Fig. 2, GFP alone was localized throughout the cell (construct F (Fig. 2)). In contrast, the three zinc fingers of GKLF, devoid of the 5′ basic region, were able to redistribute the GFP fusion protein exclusively to the nucleus (construct A (Fig. 2)). Moreover, not all three zinc fingers were required for nuclear localization, since a construct retaining only the amino-terminal 1½ fingers also localized to the nucleus (construct B (Fig. 2)). This latter observation is different from that of a previous study involving a GKLF-related protein, zif268/Egr-1, in which deletion of any of its zinc fingers resulted in a loss of nuclear localization (10Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a construct containing only the 5′ basic region of GKLF was also able to drive the GFP fusion protein into the nucleus (construct C (Fig. 2)). These results indicate that the 5′ basic region as well as the zinc fingers of GKLF function as potent NLSs and that each is capable of independently translocating a heterologous protein into the nucleus. The NLS of zif268/Egr-1 has been examined in detail in two previous studies (4Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While one study suggests that the three zinc fingers of zif268/Egr-1 are sufficient for nuclear localization (10Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), another study indicates that the 5′ basic region of zif268/Egr-1 in combination with its zinc fingers are necessary for full localization to the nucleus (4Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Because the 5′ basic region of GKLF alone is a sufficient and strong NLS, we compared the ability of this region of zif268/Egr-1 to that of GKLF to localize GFP to the nucleus. Our results confirmed the previous observations (4Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the 5′ basic region of zif268/Egr-1 functions as an NLS (construct D (Fig. 2)). However, the potency of this region to localize GFP to the nucleus appears to be relatively lower than that of the corresponding region of GKLF since in cells transfected with construct D, nuclear fluorescence was relatively weak and cytoplasmic fluorescence could be seen in a fair number of transfected cells when compared with cells transfected with construct C (Fig. 2). Last, it was previously shown that a point mutation converting an arginine to a glycine in the third zinc finger of zif268/Egr-1, a region with a core NLS sequence, destroyed its nuclear localization (10Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed the ability of this putative NLS to direct nuclear localization by the GFP fusion approach. Surprisingly, the results show that despite the presence of a core NLS in this region, the fusion protein was only weakly localized to the nucleus (construct E (Fig. 2)). Combining the results of our study and the two previous reports, it appears that the relative nuclear localizing activity of the 5′ basic region and the zinc fingers of GKLF are stronger than that of the corresponding regions of zif268/Egr-1 (Figs. 1 and 2; Refs. 4Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar and 10Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein nuclear localization is a relatively new topic in the field of protein transport. In the last decade, significant progress has been made toward the understanding of the mechanisms that mediate localization of proteins to the nucleus. This is in part due to the availability of data bases containing amino acid sequences of a large number of transcription factors. By comparing these sequences, it becomes clear that most transcription factors depend on specific nuclear localization signals to achieve efficient translocation into the nucleus (2Boulikas T. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 193-227PubMed Google Scholar, 3Boulikas T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 55: 32-58Google Scholar). Further investigation of the function of individual NLSs should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for nuclear localization. In addition, it is becoming clear that many transcription factors contain more than one NLS and that the rate of nuclear import may be directly related to the number of NLSs present (22Dworetzky S.I. Lanford R.E. Feldherr C.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus, the process of nuclear localization may reflect yet another level of regulation in transcription factors. The goal of the present study was to delineate the NLS within a newly identified zinc finger-containing transcription factor, GKLF (5Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), also known as EZF (6Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The results of our study clearly demonstrate that GKLF contains two NLSs, each capable of functioning independently and efficiently to translocate either GKLF or a heterologous protein into the nucleus. One of these NLSs resides in the 5′ basic region of GKLF, which includes a core NLS sequence (four arginines and lysines within a hexapeptide) from aa residues 385–390 (PKRGRR). The second NLS is located within the zinc finger portion of GKLF within the amino-terminal 1½ zinc finger region, which alone is sufficient to confer nuclear localization. The finding that the zinc fingers of GKLF contain an NLS is both surprising and interesting, since no putative NLS (core or bipartite) is found within the finger region. Nonetheless, our results are consistent with the conclusion from a previous study that a “global” structure of zinc fingers, rather than specific sequences, serves as an NLS for zif268/Egr-1 (10Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A notable difference between GKLF and zif268/Egr-1 is that the latter requires the participation of all three zinc fingers for efficient nuclear translocation while GKLF requires only the first 1½ fingers. It appears that while both these proteins belong to the Krüppel family of transcription factors due to conservation of their zinc finger sequences, they appear to have diverged sufficiently that their signals for nuclear localization are structurally different. A comparison of GKLF's aa sequence with those stored in the GenBank™ data base revealed several transcription factors with highly homologous sequences to the zinc finger region of GKLF. These proteins include LKLF, EKLF, and BTEB2 (5Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In fact, before the publication of our study on the identification of GKLF, Lingrel and colleagues proposed that LKLF, EKLF, and BTEB2 belong to the same multigene family (7Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.S. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Indeed, the percent amino acid identity between the zinc finger regions of GKLF and LKLF, EKLF, and BTEB2, is 91, 85, and 82%, respectively. If instead, the 20 amino acids within the 5′ basic region of these proteins are compared, GKLF and LKLF are 90% identical while GKLF and EKLF are 65% identical (Fig. 3). More importantly, the 5′ basic region of GKLF contains an identical core NLS to that of LKLF (PKRGRR), which is nearly identical to that of EKLF (SKRGRR). Since the 5′ basic region of GKLF was shown to function as a potent NLS, and since GKLF is highly similar to both LKLF and EKLF in the corresponding region, we would predict that the 5′ basic region of LKLF and EKLF would also function as a strong NLS. The one exception to the hypothesis proposed by Lingrel and colleagues (7Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.S. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) seems to be BTEB2. Despite an overall similarity in the aa sequence between the zinc fingers of GKLF and BTEB2 (82%), the sequences in the 5′ basic region of the two proteins are very different, sharing only 15% identity (Fig. 3). In fact, when other Krüppel proteins with conserved zinc finger sequences are compared, the 5′ basic region of BTEB2 is more related to a different group of proteins, which include BKLF, CPBP, and SP1 (Fig. 3). The 5′ basic region of two of these proteins, BTEB2 and SP1, do not even contain a core NLS. The aa sequences of the 5′ basic region of another group of zinc finger proteins, including early growth response α, transforming factor β-inducible early gene, and GC box-binding protein, are even more divergent from those of the GKLF family of proteins (Fig. 3). In fact, no sequences that even resemble an NLS can be identified in this group. Taken together, our study suggests that the Krüppel family of transcription factors can be divided into subfamilies based on homology of the 5′ basic region, a region clearly shown to be important for the nuclear localization of GKLF. Our study also demonstrates that GKLF, LKLF, and EKLF are indeed closely related members of the same subfamily whereas BTEB2 belongs to a different subfamily. Our study indicates that the 5′ basic region of zif268/Egr-1 contains an NLS, which functionally does not appear to be as strong as that of GKLF. This result is consistent with those of two previous studies. In one study (4Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), the 5′ basic region of zif268/Egr-1 was fused to β-galactosidase, and in another study (10Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the region was retained in constructs in which all three zinc fingers of zif268/Egr-1 were deleted. In each case, an incomplete nuclear localization was observed. An inspection of the aa sequence in the 5′ basic region of zif268/Egr-1 and other related proteins such as Egr-2 and Egr-3 (Fig. 3) showed that they do not contain a core NLS but exhibit characteristics of a bipartite NLS. It is possible that secondary or tertiary structure may contribute to the function of this region as an NLS. More likely, however, is that this region contributes to the overall nuclear localization of zif268/Egr-1 when it is associated with the protein's zinc fingers as suggested previously (4Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another interesting finding derived from the analysis of the zif268/Egr-1's NLS is the effect of the carboxyl half of its third zinc finger in translocating GFP to the nucleus (construct E(Fig. 2)). Previous studies indicate that a mutation of the first arginine residue in this region in the context of the whole protein destroyed nuclear localization despite the fact that the zinc finger structure was maintained (10Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that this peptide sequence should be a potent NLS. Indeed, a core NLS sequence is present in this region, although it appears in an infrequently observed pattern where an arginine residue is separated from a lysine residue by two nonbasic aa residues (RKRHTK). In the study by Boulikas (3Boulikas T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 55: 32-58Google Scholar), NLSs with this type of configuration account for only 5% of 271 core NLSs examined. When determined empirically, this particular motif was shown to be relatively inefficient in directing a fused albumin protein into the nucleus (21Goldfarb D.S. Gariepy J. Schoolnik G. Kornberg R.D. Nature. 1986; 322: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with our finding that this region by itself confers fairly poor nuclear localization (construct E (Fig. 2)). In conclusion, we have shown that GKLF contains two potent and independent nuclear localization signals, the sequences of which are highly conserved in two other Krüppel-like factors, LKLF and EKLF. In addition, by sequence and/or structural analysis of the 5′ basic regions of other Krüppel proteins, three additional subfamilies are identified, each predicted to utilize this region to a somewhat different extent for nuclear localization. These differences allow the separation of the various Krüppel proteins into distinct subfamilies and may reflect differences in the mechanisms regulating nuclear import among the subfamilies.

The high temperature of the sunspot (3200 K) gave rise to a highly congested pure rotational spectrum in the 10-micrometer region that involved energy levels at least halfway to dissociation. Traditional spectroscopy, based on perturbation theory, is inadequate for this problem. Instead, accurate variational solutions of the vibration-rotation Schrödinger equation were used to make assignments, revealing unexpected features, including rotational difference bands and fewer degeneracies than anticipated. These results indicate that a shift away from perturbation theory to first principles calculations is necessary in order to assign spectra of hot polyatomic molecules such as water."

However, the physical structures and molecular interactions that mediate these effects are entirely unknown. Interaction sites on the pore-forming α subunit have been identified for several voltage-dependent ion channel auxiliary subunits, including the Ca2+ and K+ channel β subunits. The binding site of the Ca2+ channel β subunit has been localized to a region of approximately 18 amino acids in the α1 subunit I-II cytoplasmic linker (15Pragnell M.P. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T.

Interaction sites between K+ channel α and β subunits have been mapped to the amino-terminal A and B box (17Yu W. Xu J. Li M.

Unlike the previously described cytoplasmic interactions, assessment of interactions between two transmembrane proteins has generally been more challenging. Transmembrane proteins such as the Ca2+channel α2δ subunit are often extensively glycosylated, which may preclude the use of bacterial, insect, or in vitroexpression systems because glycosylation is frequently species-dependent. Likewise, the expression and correct formation of disulfide linkages is also difficult to reproduce in anin vitro expression system. Also, although there are reports of successful uses of the two-hybrid yeast expression system to map interaction sites of two transmembrane proteins (21Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), these have often been performed on a more limited basis after initial investigations localized interaction domains using mammalian expression systems. Using transiently transfected human tsA201 cells, we have implicated the extracellular domain of the α2δ subunit in the assembly with the α1 subunit and have also shown that this region is responsible for modulation of dihydropyridine binding affinity to the α1 subunit. tsA201 cells (SV40 large T antigen transformed HEK 293 cells) (Cell Genesis, Foster City, CA) were maintained at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method on 50–70% confluent cells. Generally 30 μg of each channel subunit DNA (for 150-mm dish) was added to 1.25 ml of 250 mm sterile filtered CaCl2. An equal volume of 2 × sterile HEBS (274 mm NaCl, 40 mmHEPES, 12 mm dextrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, adjusted to final pH 7.05) was added drop by drop to the Ca2+/DNA mixture with constant agitation. The precipitate was allowed to form for 30 min and added dropwise to the plated cells. The medium was changed the next day. The cDNA encoding the rat brain α2δ subunit and truncated forms were all transferred to pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and have been described previously (10Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1996; 16: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The α1S repeat III was created by polymerase chain reaction utilizing a forward primer beginning at nucleotide 2544 and a reverse primer beginning at nucleotide 3489. A Kozak initiation start consisting of CCACCATGG (where the methionine start site is underlined) was created in the forward primer along with aKpnI site for insertion into polylinker of pcDNA3. The reverse primer contained an in frame termination site and aXbaI site for ligation. tsA201 cells were harvested 48 h after transfection by washing two times with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min. Cell membranes were prepared immediately by resuspending cell pellet from one 150-mm plate in 20 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 with 0.64 mmbenzamidine, and 0.23 mmPMSF). 2The abbreviations used are: PMSF, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; [3H]PN200-110, isopropyl-4-(2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-([3H]methoxycarbonyl)-pyridine-3-carboxylate; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin. After a 15-min incubation on ice, swollen cells were disrupted by five strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 37 min to collect the membranes. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer I (0.3 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm PMSF, and 0.75 mm benzamidine) and passed through a 28 gauge needle. Binding assays were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.23 mm PMSF, 0.64 mm benzamidine, and 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (binding buffer) in a final assay volume of 500 μl. For saturation analysis, 0.05–2 nm (+)-[3H]PN200-110 (Amersham Corp.) were incubated in the dark with 80 μg of membrane protein for 60 min at 37 °C. Nonspecifically bound ligand was determined by the addition of 50 μm nitrendipine. Specific binding sites were determined by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. Radiolabeled membranes were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold binding buffer on a GF/B glass fiber filter (Whatman) using a Brandel cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD). Data were fitted by a single-site binding model applying nonlinear regression analysis using GraFit software (Trithacus Software, Staines, UK). Cell membranes (500 μg) were solubilized in 1 ml of total volume of 1% (w/v) digitonin and 1m NaCl (final concentrations) for 1 h at 4 °C on a rolling platform. Protease inhibitors were added at a concentration of 0.23 mm PMSF and 0.64 mm benzamidine. Solubilized protein was isolated by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and subsequently diluted 2-fold with ice-cold double distilled H20. Solubilized protein was added to 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose that had been preincubated overnight with sheep 41 antiserum (α1C II-III loop) (4Liu H. De Waard M. Scott V.E.S. Gurnett C.A. Lennon V.A.

Trypsin concentrations were varied from 1:1000 to 1:10 (trypsin:protein), and the incubation time was variable between 0 and 160 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mm PMSF. Trypsin digested triads were then solubilized in 1% digitonin and 0.5 mNaCl for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 70,000 rpm for 30 min. Solubilized protein was added to WGA-Sepharose (Sigma) and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Bound protein was eluted in 300 mm N-acetylglucosamine in Buffer I. For sucrose gradient fractionation, samples were concentrated to 600 μl in a YM100 (Amicon) concentration unit. Samples were loaded onto 16-ml linear gradients of 5–20% (w/w) sucrose in 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm PMSF. Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 28 rotor with SW 28.1 buckets for 2 h at 150,000 rpm at 4 °C. Gradients were then fractionated (1.2 ml) from the top with an Isco gradient fractionator, and 100 μl of each was analyzed on a 5–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted with monoclonal antibody IIF7 or rabbit 136 polyclonal against the Ca2+ channel α2 subunit (23Gurnett C.A.

Imagawa T. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7943-7946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to screen 2 × 104 clones of α1S subunit epitope library in Y1090 Escherichia coli. Inserts were amplified from pure phage positives by polymerase chain reaction using primers directed to λgt11 phage arms. These were directly inserted into a T-vector (made from Bluescript Sk− plasmid) for sequencing. All inserts were sequenced using either the dideoxy chain termination method Sequenase II (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Because of the extensive post-translational processing events involved in the formation of the α2δ subunit (N-linked glycosylation, disulfide linkages, and subunit cleavage), we chose to utilize the mammalian tsA201 cell line for expression. The endogenous proteolytic cleavage between the α2 and δ subunits was investigated by Western blot analysis of membranes from cells transfected with the full-length α2δ subunit. In nonreducing conditions, an antibody directed against the α2 subunit recognized a protein of 175 kDa in both skeletal muscle triads and in membranes prepared from tsA201 cells transfected with the full-length α2δ subunit (Fig. 1). One apparent difference between native and transfected α2δ protein is that the transfected α2δ protein ran as a broader band. This may reflect larger amounts of incompletely processed forms including untrimmed glycosylation and immature noncleaved protein that often result from transient expression. Cells expressing only the α2subunit produced a protein migrating at 150 kDa in both the presence and the absence of reducing agents, which is consistent with the addition of more than 40 kDa of N-linked oligosaccharide. When identical cell membranes were electrophoresed in reducing conditions, native skeletal muscle α2δ subunit shifted to an apparent molecular mass of 150 kDa. Likewise, there was a noticeable shift in molecular mass of the transfected α2δ protein, suggesting that the cleavage site and disulfide linkages are similar to native protein. To test the involvement of the extracellular domain of the α2δ subunit in the interaction with the α1 subunit, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using cells transfected with both α1C subunit and either the full-length α2δ subunit or any one of the truncated α2δ subunit constructs (Fig.2 A). Cell membranes were solubilized in 1% digitonin and 1 m NaCl prior to immunoprecipitation. The full-length α2δ subunit assembles with the α1C subunit as demonstrated by its coimmunoprecipitation with an anti-α1C antibody and detection by Western blot analysis with an anti-α2 antibody (Fig. 2 B). No α2δ protein was immunoprecipitated from control untransfected cells. In addition, no α2δ protein was precipitated from cells in the absence of the α1 subunit (data not shown). Truncation of 450 extracellular amino-terminal amino acids of the α2δ subunit abolished the ability of this protein to assemble with the α1C subunit, despite its abundance in the starting material. Likewise, the α2subunit expressed in the absence of the δ subunit was also unable to coimmunoprecipitate with the α1C subunit. We also investigated the role of the transmembrane domain of the δ subunit in assembly with the α1C subunit (Fig.2 B). Substitution of the transmembrane domain from adhalin, an unrelated type I transmembrane protein (recently renamed α-sarcoglycan), did not appear to alter the ability of the protein to assemble with the α1C subunit. In this chimera, the 5 cytoplasmic amino acids of the α2δ protein were also substituted with adhalin sequence. Therefore, we conclude that neither intracellular or transmembrane sequences of the α2δ subunit are required for interaction with the α1subunit. The region of the α2δ subunit responsible for modulation of dihydropyridine binding to the α1C subunit was also investigated. Although [3H]PN200-110 binding to whole cell tsA201 cell membranes was often low and nonsaturable when α1C was transfected in the absence of any auxiliary subunit, several experiments resulted in significant and saturable binding that allowed us to determine the binding affinity (K d) and binding capacity (B max) using saturation analysis (TableI). Cells expressing α1C alone had an average B max of 94.6 ± 51.7 fmol/mg (n = 4).Table IComparison of K d and saturable [3 H]PN200–110 binding to total microsomes from tsA201 cells transfected with α 1C and α 2 δ constructsMembranesK d ± S.E.Saturable/totalnmα1C1.34 ± 0.794 /7α1Cα2δ1-aPaired t test, p < 0.05 versus α1C.0.16 ± 0.085 /5α1Cα20.65 ± 0.263 /5α1CNΔ28–4731.31 ± 0.743 /5α1Cα2δAd1-aPaired t test, p < 0.05 versus α1C.0.21 ± 0.164 /4tsA201 cells were transfected with the cDNAs encoding Ca2+channel subunits in the combinations indicated.

Data are presented as the means ± S.E. Also shown are the number of experiments (separate transfections) in which saturable binding was measured and the total number of experiments that were performed. Coexpression of the full-length α2δ subunit with the α1C subunit resulted in a significant increase in binding, most of which could be accounted for by a significant mean increase in the binding affinity (Table I). Binding was saturable in all experiments. There appeared to be little effect of the α2δ subunit on B max(B max = 133 ± 73.5 fmol/mg), although there was significant error between experiments in theB max depending on the transfection efficiency. Likewise, Western blot analysis on whole cell membranes from transfected cells showed no effect of coexpression of the α2δ subunit on the protein expression of the α1 subunit (data not shown). The binding affinity, however, was not affected by the differences in transfection efficiency. As expected, when the α2 subunit was coexpressed with the α1C subunit, there was no effect on [3H]PN200-110 binding. This is consistent with coimmunoprecipitation experiments that demonstrated the inability of the α2 subunit to associate with α1 in the absence of the δ subunit. However, coexpression of the α2δAd chimera, in which the transmembrane domain of the α2δ subunit was replaced with that of adhalin, increased [3H]PN200-110 binding affinity to approximately the same extent as full-length α2δ protein. Because the α1 subunit is very large and difficult to express, we chose an alternative approach to identify regions interacting with the α2δ subunit. Our approach was to trypsinize skeletal muscle microsomes containing native dihydropyridine receptors and follow the α1S subunit fragments remaining in association with the α2δ subunit during WGA affinity chromatography. By taking advantage of the selective ability of the glycosylated α2δ subunit to bind WGA, any α1S fragment identified is presumed to bind WGA only through its interaction with the α2δ subunit. With increasing concentrations of trypsin, an α1Ssubunit-specific monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope within the first extracellular loop of the IIIS5-IIIS6 linker (amino acid 955–1005) (IIF7) detected 28- and 18-kDa α1S subunit fragments eluted from a WGA-Sepharose column (Fig. 3). Sucrose gradient fractionation was subsequently used to demonstrate cosedimentation of the α1S subunit fragments with the intact full-length α2δ subunit (Fig. 4). Multiple tryptic fragments of α1 did not bind WGA and were identified in the starting material, including carboxyl-terminal fragments (identified by monoclonal antibody IIC12) and fragments of repeat I and II and the II-III loop (identified by polyclonal antibody sheep DHPR) (data not shown).Figure 4Sucrose gradient fractionation of trypsinized skeletal muscle WGA eluate. Trypsinized skeletal muscle triads were loaded onto WGA-Sepharose and eluted with 300 mm N-acetylglucosamine. Samples were loaded onto 5–20% linear sucrose gradients, centrifuged, and fractionated from the top. Alternate fractions were analyzed on a 5–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel and immunoblotted with either monoclonal antibody IIF7 against the α1S subunit (top) or polyclonal antibody against the α2δ subunit (Rabbit 136) (bottom).

Although the α2δ subunit and repeat III were well expressed, we were unable to detect stable interactions between these two proteins using coimmunoprecipitation assays after solubilization in 1% digitionin and 1 m NaCl (data not shown). This suggests that expression of the α1S subunit repeat III by itself is not sufficient to form stable interactions with the α2δ subunit. Our data support a model whereby the interaction sites between the α2δ and α1 subunits are entirely extracellular, because transmembrane modifications of the α2δ subunit did not appear to alter coassembly with the α1 subunit. Morever, our data suggest a requirement for nontransmembrane domains of the δ subunit in determining a stable association between the α2δ and α1proteins, because the α2 protein by itself could not support interaction. δ may contain the interaction site, or the tertiary structure it confers on α2 through its disulfide linkages may enable α2 to directly interact with the α1 subunit. Low expression of δ expressed alone resulted in our inability to distinguish between these possibilities. However, δ was shown to be able to compete with full-length α2δ protein in Xenopus oocytes and inhibit its stimulatory effects on current amplitude (10Gurnett C.A. De Waard M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1996; 16: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and expression studies in tsA201 cells demonstrated that coexpression of δ can significantly modulate the biophysical properties of the α1C subunit.1 Interestingly, our data are consistent with reports regarding a functionally related pair of proteins, the Na+,K+-ATPase α and auxiliary β subunit, in which the interaction sites have also been localized to extracellular domains (24Hamrick M. Renaud K.J. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24367-24373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lemas M.V. Hamrick M. Takeyasu K. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the yeast two-hybrid assay was successful in further localizing the site of interaction on the β subunit to the 61 amino acids most proximal to the membrane (21Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the interaction sites between the voltage-dependent Na+ channel α and β1 or β2 subunits have not been mapped, it is interesting to note that deletion of the β1intracellular domain does not alter functional effects of β1 subunit coexpression (26Chen C. Cannon S. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 431: 186-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that this interaction may also be in the extracellular domain. Repeat III of the Ca2+ channel α1S subunit appears to interact strongly with the α2δ subunit after extensive trypsinization, although we cannot exclude the involvement of other unidentified fragments (especially in repeat IV) based on our inability to recognize small tryptic fragments with specific antibodies. Interestingly, whereas repeat III remains in association with the α2δ subunit after extensive trypsinization, we were unable to reconstitute the interaction between this small region and α2δ in an expression system. This suggests that multiple regions of the α1 subunit may be involved in assembly with the α2δ subunit. In analogous studies on the voltage-dependent Na+ channel, multiple domains within the carboxyl-terminal half of the skeletal muscle Na+ channel α subunit were shown to be required for functional response of the coexpressed Na+ channel β1 subunit on inactivation kinetics (27Makita N. Bennett P.B. George A.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Association of the α2δ subunit with the carboxyl-terminal half of the α1 subunit is consistent with the significant effects that we and others have measured of the α2δ subunit on dihydropyridine binding affinity (28Wei X. Pan S. Lang W. Kim H. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27106-27111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The membrane spanning segments IIIS6 and IVS6 of the α1Ssubunit have recently been shown to contain amino acids critical for dihydropyridine binding (29Peterson B.Z. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18201-18204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), although the S5-S6 extracellular linkers of the III and IV repeats also confer dihydropyridine sensitivity (30Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Streissnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of the α2δ subunit, which is capable of modulating dihydropyridine binding, may be interacting with sites at or near these dihydropyridine binding sites within the III and IV repeats. Based on several observations regarding the extracellular regions of the α1 subunit, we can speculate on the exact sites of interaction. Most extracellular loops of the α1 subunit are small in size, the smallest being only 7 amino acids. The largest extracellular loops, and thus the regions with the highest probability of interacting with the α2δ subunit, are the S5-S6 linkers, which also contain the pore. Experimental evidence regarding the folding pattern of the α1 subunit suggests that the S5-S6 regions of all four repeats closely interact to form the central pore (31MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 889-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These amino acids near the pore, while neighboring each other in tertiary structure, are far apart in primary structure, and thus it may be difficult to reconstitute the structure of this region by expression of a single repeat. Based on the substantial effects of the α2δ subunit on dihydropyridine binding affinity, we predict that the smallest regions of interaction may be within the S5-S6 extracellular loops, particularly of repeat III, because this region copurifies with the α2δ subunit on WGA chromatography.

https://openalex.org/W2317853404,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10 has been observed in several human cancers including glioblastomas, meningiomas, melanomas and endometrial and prostate carcinomas. We have investigated the incidence of LOH on chromosome 10 in 36 human transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) of the bladder, three upper urinary tract TCCs and one lymph node metastasis, using a panel of 27 highly polymorphic markers spanning 10p (short arm) and 10q (long arm). Fourteen bladder tumours (39%), the three upper urinary tract tumours and the lymph node metastasis showed LOH for at least one locus on chromosome 10. Remarkably, LOH on chromosome 10 was observed mainly in muscle-invasive (P=0.01) and high grade tumours (P=0.03). For five tumours and the lymph node metastasis, LOH was found at all informative loci, indicating monosomy or isodisomy of chromosome 10. The deletion mapping of the tumours with partial loss delineated two minimal regions of loss on chromosome 10q. One region, the most telomeric, was bounded by markers D10S214 and D10S169 and the other, the most proximal, was bounded by markers D10S222 and D10S531. Our results demonstrate that chromosome 10q LOH is common in muscle-invasive bladder cancers and that two potential tumour suppressor loci, at 10q24.1-q24.3 and 10q26.1-q26.2, may contribute to the malignant progression of these tumours. Localization of the smallest common regions of loss in bladder tumours provides a starting point for the identification of the genes involved."

Our previous study indicated that in the case of vascular smooth muscle cells of diabetic rats, an increased mitogenic response was observed for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a member of the EGF family (19Fukuda K. Inui Y. Kawata S. Higashiyama S. Matsuda Y. Maeda Y. Igura T. Yoshida S. Taniguchi N. Matsuzawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1680-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that significant amounts of HB-EGF are produced in SMC and macrophages of atherosclerotic plaques (20Miyagawa J. Higashiyama S. Kawata S. Inui Y. Tamura S. Yamamoto K. Nishida M. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 404-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that HB-EGF could be implicated in atherogenesis. Other growth regulators, such as basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, transforming growth factor-β, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α, also appear to be involved in atherogenesis (14Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9931) Google Scholar, 17Libby P. Hansson G.K. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 5-15PubMed Google Scholar).The aim of the present study was to examine the role of MG and 3-DG in the regulation of the expression of growth factors in relation to the development of diabetic complications. The data suggest that MG and 3-DG selectively induce HB-EGF in primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) by increasing the level of intracellular peroxides. This may provide a new insight into the mechanism by which diabetic complications, such as atherosclerosis, arise.DISCUSSIONDiabetes mellitus is commonly accompanied by atherosclerosis. SMC proliferation plays an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions (14Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9931) Google Scholar, 15Ross R. Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope D.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 155-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 16Ross R. N. Engl. J.

Interestingly, it has been reported that among the members of the EGF family only HB-EGF appears to be involved in atherogenesis so far. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to evaluate the effect of MG and 3-DG on expression levels of HB-EGF and PDGF in RASMC and to explore the mechanism to this.We have shown that MG and 3-DG significantly induce HB-EGF and that the induced HB-EGF mRNA levels are due to activation of this gene transcription, which is not dependent upon de novo protein synthesis. MG and 3-DG, however, had no effect on PDGF-A and PDGF-B mRNA levels under the same conditions. These results suggest that MG and 3-DG may be involved in a specific signal pathway and thereby selectively induce HB-EGF. Although the concentration of MG needed to induce the HB-EGF in these studies was in the order of 100–400 μm and appears to be slightly higher than concentrations in diabetes, 5–10 μm. The concentrations of MG as judged by the 14C-methylglyoxal incorporation was much lower (in the range of 2–4 μm), suggesting that MG probably as well as 3-DG may act at physiologically relevant concentrations. It is possible that lower concentration of dicarbonyl, as seen in patients with diabetes, would be sufficient to induce HB-EGF mRNA in the cells.ROS have been implicated in the etiology of a large number of diseases, such as cancer, inflammation, aging, and diabetic complications (42Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Cross C.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 598-620PubMed Google Scholar,43Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). MG rapidly generates ROS including superoxides, during the glycation reaction (36Yim H.-S. Kang S.-O. Hah Y.-C. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28228-28233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), increases ROS in hepatocytes (35Kalapos M.P,. Littauer A. de Groot H. Arch. Toxicol. 1993; 67: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MG and 3-DG also induce apoptotic cell death in macrophage-derived cell lines (44Okado A. Kawasaki Y. Hasuike Y. Takahashi M. Teshima T. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Chronic exposure to abnormally high concentrations of these dicarbonyl, therefore, may be a contributing factor in oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus. The present study showed that, prior to the induction of HB-EGF mRNA, MG significantly increased intracellular peroxides in RASMC (Fig. 7 A). There are several possible ways by which intracellular ROS levels could be increased by MG. One is that ROS are produced during the glycation reaction of amino acids or proteins with MG. Another is that the glutathione content of cells are depleted during MG metabolism by the glyoxalase system and the cells, therefore, cannot efficiently eliminate ROS. Another possible mechanism is that MG modifies and inactivates enzymes which scavenge ROS, such as superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione transferases because MG is able to bind to and modify arginine, lysine, and cysteine residues in proteins (45Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Cheung S.-T. Fonda M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 940-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, after treatment with 3-DG, a more rapid increase of intracellular peroxide was observed in RASMC (Fig. 7 B). 3-DG also causes cross-linking of proteins and modification of their biological properties (10Niwa T. Takeda N. Yoshizumi H. Tatematsu A. Ohara M. Tomiyama S. Niimura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commum. 1993; 196: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, MG and 3-DG may cause the increased intracellular peroxides by modifying those enzyme proteins.While ROS can cause protein damage, proteolysis, DNA fragmentation, lipid peroxidation and ultimately cell lysis, several studies indicate that the ROS can also stimulate growth-related intracellular signals, such as intracellular alkalinization (47Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as well as increase in c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogene mRNA levels (48Crawford D. Zbinden I. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 27-32Google Scholar). ROS activate cellular growth and play a significant role in tumor promotion and degenerative diseases (49Ames B.N. Science. 1983; 221: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar, 50Halliwell B. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). A previous report indicates that ROS specifically stimulate the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells but not endothelial cells or fibroblasts (51Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study indicates that oxidative stress is involved in MG and 3-DG-induced HB-EGF mRNAs. The fact that H2O2 increased the level of HB-EGF mRNA and an antioxidant, NAC, completely abolished both the dicarbonyl-induced ROS and HB-EGF mRNA in RASMC supports these conclusions. These results provide strong evidence that MG and 3-DG trigger HB-EGF mRNA induction in RASMC by creating a state of oxidative stress.NF-κB activation is known to be regulated by ROS (52Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeurle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3396) Google Scholar). Thus, we also examined whether NF-κB is activated by MG and 3-DG using a gel mobility shift assay in conjunction with two types of the mouse NF-κB probe (53Chen X. Raab G. Deutsch U. Zhang J. Ezzell R.M. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18285-18294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). After incubation with MG or 3-DG, the extent of NF-κB activation was not measurably changed, contrary to our expectations (data not shown). Therefore, NF-κB does not appear to be a responsive factor for the dicarbonyl-induced HB-EGF. Another transcription factor, AP-1, appears to respond to ROS, as well (54Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Lau L.F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2804-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). ROS activates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) (55Lo Y.Y.C. Wong J.M.S. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15703-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and the activated JNK phosphorylates c-Jun (56Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar), leading to stimulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity. There is an AP-1 consensus sequence in the HB-EGF promotor (53Chen X. Raab G. Deutsch U. Zhang J. Ezzell R.M. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18285-18294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 57Fen Z. Dhadly M.S. Yoshizumi M. Hilkert R.J. Quertermous T. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Lee M.-E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7932-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). JNK and the AP-1 sites may play an important role in the dicarbonyl-induced HB-EGF gene expression and further study will be necessary to elucidate the role of the JNK signaling pathway and the AP-1 site in the induction of HB-EGF by the dicarbonyl.Both MG and 3-DG-induced ROS generation and HB-EGF mRNA increases were also suppressed by aminoguanidine, which is an efficient scavenger of dicarbonyl, as well as an inhibitor of glycation. Aminoguanidine can suppress the formation of the dicarbonyl-modified proteins (32Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 170SCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Odetti P.R. Borgogio A. Pascale A.D. Rolandi P. Adezati L. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 796-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These inhibitory effects of aminoguanidine may be related to the proposed potential efficacy in the prevention and therapy of diabetic complications.Activated protein kinase C participates in the production of ROS (40Rossi F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 853: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and the induction of HB-EGF mRNA (26Temizer D.H. Yoshizumi M. Perrella M.A. Susanni E.E. Quertermous T. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24892-24896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, while ROS directly increased DNA synthesis and cell numbers in SMC, this effect was independent of protein kinase C activation (49Ames B.N. Science. 1983; 221: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). The present finding showed that pretreatments of RASMC with 50 nm TPA for 24 h, which down-regulates protein kinase C, had no effect on the dicarbonyl-induced HB-EGF mRNA levels, indicating that the dicarbonyl-induced HB-EGF mRNA in RASMC is independent from protein kinase C activity.In our study, we also found that MG and 3-DG induced HB-EGF mRNA transiently and the dicarbonyl-increased ROS did not maintain for a long time (data not shown). This is because the dicarbonyl is unstable and metabolized very easily both in RASMC and in the culture medium. Regular stimulation of RASMC by the dicarbonyl during diabetes may produce ROS and induce HB-EGF permanently, which result in initiation of smooth muscle proliferation in atherogenesis. It is also likely that the dicarbonyl-increased HB-EGF affects some other kinds of growth factors, cytokines, and vasoregulatory molecules which may participate in this process.To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that MG and 3-DG induce HB-EGF by provoking oxidative stress. MG and 3-DG, through these effects, may be involved in the development of diabetic complications such as atherosclerosis.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3186-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and by the oxidation of hydroxyacetone and aminoacetone (4Reichard G.A. Skutches C.L. Hoeldtke R.D. Owen O.E.

Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The estimated rate of formation of methylglyoxal in tissues of normal healthy subjects is approximately 125 μm/day which can largely be accounted for as a result of fragmentation of triose phosphates (2Phillips S.A. Thornalley P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The glyoxalase system, using reduced glutathione as a cofactor, catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal to d-lactate via the intermediateS-d-lactoylglutathione. The formation of methylglyoxal in cultured human red blood cells is increased under hyperglycemic conditions and by the addition of fructose,d-glyceraldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, acetone, and hydroxyacetone (7Thornalley P.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Phillips, S. A., and Thornalley, P. J. (1993) Biochem. Soc. Trans, 21, (suppl.) 163S.Google Scholar). The serum concentration of methylglyoxal increases 5–6-fold in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 2–3-fold in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetic mellitus (9McLellan A.C. Thornalley P.J. Benn J. Sonksen P.H. Clin. Sci. 1994; 87: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). 3-Deoxyglucosone (3-DG), another dicarbonyl, is a major and highly reactive intermediate in the glycation reaction and a potent cross-linker responsible for the polymerization of proteins to form advanced glycation end products (10Niwa T. Takeda N. Yoshizumi H. Tatematsu A. Ohara M. Tomiyama S. Niimura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commum. 1993; 196: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Plasma 3-DG levels are also increased under diabetic conditions (11Yamada H. Miyata S. Igaki N. Yatabe H. Miyauchi Y. Ohara T. Sakai M. Shoda H. Oimomi M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20275-20280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our previous studies, the enzyme that reduces 3-DG was identified as an aldehyde reductase (12Takahashi M. Fujii J. Teshima T. Suzuki K. Shiba T. Taniguchi N. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 127: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A preliminary study indicated that 3-DG induced HB-EGF in RASMC (13Taniguchi, N., Kaneto, H., Asahi, M., Takahashi, M., Wenyi, C., Higashiyama, S., Fujii, J., Suzuki, K., and Kayanoki, Y. (1996)Diabetes , 45, Suppl. 3, S81–S83.Google Scholar). Biochemical and clinical evidence suggests that the increased formation of MG or 3-DG in diabetes mellitus is linked to the development of diabetic complications, but the exact role of these dicarbonyl in this process remains largely unknown. Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells represents a crucial event in the development of atherosclerotic lesions (14Ross R.

Other growth regulators, such as basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, transforming growth factor-β, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α, also appear to be involved in atherogenesis (14Ross R.

It is possible that lower concentration of dicarbonyl, as seen in patients with diabetes, would be sufficient to induce HB-EGF mRNA in the cells.ROS have been implicated in the etiology of a large number of diseases, such as cancer, inflammation, aging, and diabetic complications (42Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Cross C.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 598-620PubMed Google Scholar,43Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). MG rapidly generates ROS including superoxides, during the glycation reaction (36Yim H.-S. Kang S.-O. Hah Y.-C. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28228-28233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), increases ROS in hepatocytes (35Kalapos M.P,. Littauer A. de Groot H. Arch.

Teshima T. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Chronic exposure to abnormally high concentrations of these dicarbonyl, therefore, may be a contributing factor in oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus. The present study showed that, prior to the induction of HB-EGF mRNA, MG significantly increased intracellular peroxides in RASMC (Fig. 7 A). There are several possible ways by which intracellular ROS levels could be increased by MG. One is that ROS are produced during the glycation reaction of amino acids or proteins with MG.

Surprisingly, after treatment with 3-DG, a more rapid increase of intracellular peroxide was observed in RASMC (Fig. 7 B). 3-DG also causes cross-linking of proteins and modification of their biological properties (10Niwa T.

Thus, MG and 3-DG may cause the increased intracellular peroxides by modifying those enzyme proteins.While ROS can cause protein damage, proteolysis, DNA fragmentation, lipid peroxidation and ultimately cell lysis, several studies indicate that the ROS can also stimulate growth-related intracellular signals, such as intracellular alkalinization (47Shibanuma M.

After incubation with MG or 3-DG, the extent of NF-κB activation was not measurably changed, contrary to our expectations (data not shown). Therefore, NF-κB does not appear to be a responsive factor for the dicarbonyl-induced HB-EGF. Another transcription factor, AP-1, appears to respond to ROS, as well (54Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Lau L.F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2804-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). ROS activates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) (55Lo Y.Y.C. Wong J.M.S. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15703-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and the activated JNK phosphorylates c-Jun (56Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar), leading to stimulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity. There is an AP-1 consensus sequence in the HB-EGF promotor (53Chen X. Raab G. Deutsch U. Zhang J. Ezzell R.M. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18285-18294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 57Fen Z. Dhadly M.S. Yoshizumi M. Hilkert R.J. Quertermous T. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Lee M.-E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7932-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). JNK and the AP-1 sites may play an important role in the dicarbonyl-induced HB-EGF gene expression and further study will be necessary to elucidate the role of the JNK signaling pathway and the AP-1 site in the induction of HB-EGF by the dicarbonyl.Both MG and 3-DG-induced ROS generation and HB-EGF mRNA increases were also suppressed by aminoguanidine, which is an efficient scavenger of dicarbonyl, as well as an inhibitor of glycation. Aminoguanidine can suppress the formation of the dicarbonyl-modified proteins (32Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 170SCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33Odetti P.R. Borgogio A. Pascale A.D. Rolandi P. Adezati L. Diabetes. 1990; 39: 796-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These inhibitory effects of aminoguanidine may be related to the proposed potential efficacy in the prevention and therapy of diabetic complications.Activated protein kinase C participates in the production of ROS (40Rossi F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 853: 65-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and the induction of HB-EGF mRNA (26Temizer D.H. Yoshizumi M. Perrella M.A. Susanni E.E. Quertermous T. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24892-24896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, while ROS directly increased DNA synthesis and cell numbers in SMC, this effect was independent of protein kinase C activation (49Ames B.N. Science. 1983; 221: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). The present finding showed that pretreatments of RASMC with 50 nm TPA for 24 h, which down-regulates protein kinase C, had no effect on the dicarbonyl-induced HB-EGF mRNA levels, indicating that the dicarbonyl-induced HB-EGF mRNA in RASMC is independent from protein kinase C activity.In our study, we also found that MG and 3-DG induced HB-EGF mRNA transiently and the dicarbonyl-increased ROS did not maintain for a long time (data not shown). This is because the dicarbonyl is unstable and metabolized very easily both in RASMC and in the culture medium. Regular stimulation of RASMC by the dicarbonyl during diabetes may produce ROS and induce HB-EGF permanently, which result in initiation of smooth muscle proliferation in atherogenesis. It is also likely that the dicarbonyl-increased HB-EGF affects some other kinds of growth factors, cytokines, and vasoregulatory molecules which may participate in this process.To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that MG and 3-DG induce HB-EGF by provoking oxidative stress. MG and 3-DG, through these effects, may be involved in the development of diabetic complications such as atherosclerosis. Diabetes mellitus is commonly accompanied by atherosclerosis. SMC proliferation plays an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions (14Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9931) Google Scholar, 15Ross R. Raines E.W. Bowen-Pope D.F. Cell. 1986; 46: 155-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar, 16Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (3998) Google Scholar, 17Libby P. Hansson G.K. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 5-15PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported that among the members of the EGF family only HB-EGF appears to be involved in atherogenesis so far. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to evaluate the effect of MG and 3-DG on expression levels of HB-EGF and PDGF in RASMC and to explore the mechanism to this. We have shown that MG and 3-DG significantly induce HB-EGF and that the induced HB-EGF mRNA levels are due to activation of this gene transcription, which is not dependent upon de novo protein synthesis. MG and 3-DG, however, had no effect on PDGF-A and PDGF-B mRNA levels under the same conditions. These results suggest that MG and 3-DG may be involved in a specific signal pathway and thereby selectively induce HB-EGF. Although the concentration of MG needed to induce the HB-EGF in these studies was in the order of 100–400 μm and appears to be slightly higher than concentrations in diabetes, 5–10 μm. The concentrations of MG as judged by the 14C-methylglyoxal incorporation was much lower (in the range of 2–4 μm), suggesting that MG probably as well as 3-DG may act at physiologically relevant concentrations. It is possible that lower concentration of dicarbonyl, as seen in patients with diabetes, would be sufficient to induce HB-EGF mRNA in the cells. ROS have been implicated in the etiology of a large number of diseases, such as cancer, inflammation, aging, and diabetic complications (42Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Cross C.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 598-620PubMed Google Scholar,43Baynes J.W. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). MG rapidly generates ROS including superoxides, during the glycation reaction (36Yim H.-S. Kang S.-O. Hah Y.-C. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28228-28233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), increases ROS in hepatocytes (35Kalapos M.P,. Littauer A. de Groot H. Arch. Toxicol. 1993; 67: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MG and 3-DG also induce apoptotic cell death in macrophage-derived cell lines (44Okado A. Kawasaki Y. Hasuike Y. Takahashi M. Teshima T. Fujii J. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Chronic exposure to abnormally high concentrations of these dicarbonyl, therefore, may be a contributing factor in oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus. The present study showed that, prior to the induction of HB-EGF mRNA, MG significantly increased intracellular peroxides in RASMC (Fig. 7 A). There are several possible ways by which intracellular ROS levels could be increased by MG. One is that ROS are produced during the glycation reaction of amino acids or proteins with MG. Another is that the glutathione content of cells are depleted during MG metabolism by the glyoxalase system and the cells, therefore, cannot efficiently eliminate ROS. Another possible mechanism is that MG modifies and inactivates enzymes which scavenge ROS, such as superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione transferases because MG is able to bind to and modify arginine, lysine, and cysteine residues in proteins (45Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Cheung S.-T. Fonda M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 940-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, after treatment with 3-DG, a more rapid increase of intracellular peroxide was observed in RASMC (Fig. 7 B). 3-DG also causes cross-linking of proteins and modification of their biological properties (10Niwa T. Takeda N. Yoshizumi H. Tatematsu A. Ohara M. Tomiyama S. Niimura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commum. 1993; 196: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, MG and 3-DG may cause the increased intracellular peroxides by modifying those enzyme proteins. While ROS can cause protein damage, proteolysis, DNA fragmentation, lipid peroxidation and ultimately cell lysis, several studies indicate that the ROS can also stimulate growth-related intracellular signals, such as intracellular alkalinization (47Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as well as increase in c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogene mRNA levels (48Crawford D. Zbinden I. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 27-32Google Scholar). ROS activate cellular growth and play a significant role in tumor promotion and degenerative diseases (49Ames B.N. Science. 1983; 221: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar, 50Halliwell B. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). A previous report indicates that ROS specifically stimulate the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells but not endothelial cells or fibroblasts (51Rao G.N. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 593-599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study indicates that oxidative stress is involved in MG and 3-DG-induced HB-EGF mRNAs. The fact that H2O2 increased the level of HB-EGF mRNA and an antioxidant, NAC, completely abolished both the dicarbonyl-induced ROS and HB-EGF mRNA in RASMC supports these conclusions. These results provide strong evidence that MG and 3-DG trigger HB-EGF mRNA induction in RASMC by creating a state of oxidative stress. NF-κB activation is known to be regulated by ROS (52Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeurle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3396) Google Scholar). Thus, we also examined whether NF-κB is activated by MG and 3-DG using a gel mobility shift assay in conjunction with two types of the mouse NF-κB probe (53Chen X. Raab G. Deutsch U. Zhang J.

The present study demonstrates that a DNA element, called L2a, which has been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of the mouseCD8a gene encoding an important T cell coreceptor, is a MAR. Moreover, the identities of two nuclear proteins, L2a-P1 and L2a-P2, previously shown to bind to the L2a element, have been determined. The L2a-P1 protein found to be present in all CD8-positive T cell lines tested is SATB1, a known MAR-binding protein. The widely expressed L2a-P2 protein is CDP/Cux, a MAR-binding protein that has been associated with repression of gene transcription. Interaction of both proteins with the L2a element was studied using the missing nucleoside approach, DNase I footprinting, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays with wild type and mutant L2a elements. The data suggest that CDP/Cux bound to the L2a element is displaced by binding of SATB1 and the accompanying conformational change in the DNA lying between the primary binding sites of SATB1 and CDP/Cux. We suggest that displacement of CDP/Cux by SATB1 favors transcription of theCD8a gene, possibly by enhancing or altering its association with the nuclear matrix.

The present study demonstrates that a DNA element (L2a; Ref. 19Lee W.-H. Banan M. Harriss J.V. Hwang I. Woodward E. Youn J.J. Gottlieb P.D. Int.

The CD8 molecule on the surface of T lymphocytes functions as an important coreceptor for class I major histocompatability/peptide complexes on stimulator and target cells (20Swain S.L. Immunol.

In the mouse, CD8 is expressed on class I major histocompatability complex-specific T cells as a heterodimer of CD8α and CD8β chains that are encoded by the CD8a (orLyt-2) and CD8b (or Lyt-3) genes, respectively (23Durda P.J.

Little is known concerning the regulation of the mouse CD8a and CD8b genes, but some insights have come from studies of T-T cell hybrids produced by fusing cytotoxic T lymphocytes with the BW5147 thymic lymphoma. Such hybridomas are invariably CD8-negative (26Carbone A.M. Marrack P. Kappler J.W. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1369-1375PubMed Google Scholar) due to shut-off ofCD8a gene transcription (27Gu J.J. Gottlieb P.D. Immunogenetics. 1992; 36: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but interestingly theCD8b gene, which is located 36 kb upstream of theCD8a gene (28Gorman S.D. Sun Y.H. Zamoyska R. Parnes J.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3646-3653PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1), continues to be transcribed (27Gu J.J. Gottlieb P.D.

Working on the hypothesis that the shut-off ofCD8a gene transcription in T-T cell hybridomas was due to cis-acting DNA elements upstream of the CD8a gene, stable clonal transfectants of BW5147 were produced using constructs of theCD8a gene containing varying amounts of 5′-flanking DNA and surface expression was monitored by flow microfluorometry. Initial results suggested that DNA sequences located between nucleotides −1,400 and −4,700 (the transcription start site is nucleotide +1) (see Fig. 1) were sufficient to provide the negative effect (19Lee W.-H. Banan M. Harriss J.V. Hwang I. Woodward E. Youn J.J. Gottlieb P.D. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1307-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This same region is part of a DNase I-hypersensitive site specific to CD8-positive T cells and contains two binding sites for the GATA-3 transcription factor (30Landry D.B. Engel J.D. Sen R. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 944-949Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Attention focused on a AccI/HpaI subfragment of this region (nucleotides −3800 to −4700) that lay upstream of the GATA-3 binding sites and that negatively affected CD8a gene expression (Fig. 1). A 270-nucleotideAccI/SstI subfragment of theAccI/HpaI fragment contained an element, designated L2a, which was protected in two places (called L and S) from DNase I digestion in vitro by nuclear extract of the CD8+ T cell tumor line, VL3. A fragment (called 200(L+S)) containing both protected regions could be shown in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to bind nuclear proteins from thymus as well as from a variety of cell lines. Varying amounts of two prominent retarded bands (bands 1 and 2) were observed in EMSA using the 200(L+S) fragment as probe and nuclear extracts from different cell lines and tissues (19Lee W.-H. Banan M. Harriss J.V. Hwang I. Woodward E. Youn J.J. Gottlieb P.D. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1307-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Band 1 appeared to be T cell-specific, and it reflects binding of a protein (designated L2a-P1) with an estimated molecular mass of 110–140 kDa, which apart from its presence in two CD4−CD8− T cell lines correlated with CD8α expression. Band 2 was observed using nuclear extracts of all cell lines tested, and it was shown to reflect binding of a protein (designated L2a-P2) with an estimated molecular mass of >200 kDa. In preliminary competition experiments, the L2a-P1 and L2a-P2 proteins competed for binding to the 200(L+S) fragment, and the L2a-P1 protein appeared to have the higher affinity (19Lee W.-H. Banan M. Harriss J.V. Hwang I. Woodward E. Youn J.J. Gottlieb P.D. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1307-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A model was proposed in which proteins L2a-P1 and L2a-P2 play positive and negative roles, respectively, in regulating CD8a gene transcription by binding to the L2a element (19Lee W.-H. Banan M. Harriss J.V. Hwang I. Woodward E. Youn J.J. Gottlieb P.D. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1307-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The present results demonstrate that the L2a element is a MAR, that protein L2a-P1 is SATB1, a known MAR-binding protein (15Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar), and that protein L2a-P2 is CDP/Cux, a second MAR-binding protein shown in several instances to have negative effects on gene expression (31Skalnick D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lievens P.M.J. Donady J.J. Tufarelli C. Neufeld E.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5346-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The results further demonstrate that the SATB1 and CDP/Cux proteins bind to overlapping sites on the L2a element. We suggest that binding of SATB1 to the L2a element displaces CDP/Cux and favors transcription of theCD8a gene, possibly by enhancing or altering its association with the nuclear matrix. The VL-3.B4 (VL-3) (the kind gift of Dr. Irving Weissman, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA) and BW5147 (34Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1973; 110: 1470-1475PubMed Google Scholar) T cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 5 × 10−5m 2-mercaptoethanol. The hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium-sensitive α−β−-BW5147 cell line (35White J. Blackman M. Bill J. Kappler J. Marrack P. Gold D.P. Born W. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1822-1825PubMed Google Scholar) was maintained in the same medium, and the SATB1-positive transfectant, A11 (see below), was maintained in the same medium containing G418 (250 μg/ml of active drug). The 0.9-kbAccI/HpaI fragment located 3.8–4.7 kb upstream of the mouse CD8a gene was treated with Klenow fragment and cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18 (p2211-1). The same fragment containing a deletion of 50 base pairs at its 5′ end generated by Bal 31 digestion is present in plasmid p2211-1-5′-43. The various fragments and subfragments used in EMSAs were generated by digestion of these two plasmids with enzymes that cut within the polylinker site of the plasmid and/or within the fragment. The 200(L+S) probe used in gel retardation assays consists of a 200-nucleotide genomic AccI/BstXI fragment that contains the regulatory element described by Lee and co-workers (19Lee W.-H. Banan M. Harriss J.V. Hwang I. Woodward E. Youn J.J. Gottlieb P.D. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1307-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This fragment was subcloned into pUC18 and was excised using restriction sites in the polylinker. The 158-base pair fragment used for the DNase I footprinting of the bottom strand is included in the 200(L+S) probe and was generated by digesting p2211-1-5′-43 withBamHI and BstXI followed by labeling with [α-32P]dNTPs at the BamHI end using Sequenase (Amersham Corp.). Similarly, the 150(L+S) fragment used for the missing nucleoside and DNase I footprinting experiments was obtained by digesting p2211-1-5′-43 with HindIII andBstXI and subsequent end labeling at the HindIII end with Sequenase. The 100(L+S) fragment was generated by subcloning aHincII/RsaI fragment from p2211-1-5′-43 into theSmaI site of pUC18, digesting the resulting plasmid withEcoRI and PstI, and end labeling at theEcoRI end with Sequenase. Nuclear extracts of cell lines were prepared essentially as described by Dignam et al. (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Cells (2–5 × 108) were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). DTT and PMSF were added to all buffers immediately before use. After incubation for 10 min, the cells were pelleted (1000 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A. The cells were then lysed using 10 strokes in a homogenizer (Kontes homogenizer with a B pestle; Kontes, Vineland, NJ), and nuclei were pelleted (1000 × g for 10 min), washed with 6 ml of buffer A, and pelleted again (30,000 × g for 20 min). The nuclei were resuspended in 1–2 ml of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 12 μg/ml aprotinin, and 12 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor), homogenized (∼30 strokes), and stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 30 min. Debris was pelleted (30,000 × g for 20 min), and the supernatant was dialyzed against 75 volumes of buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.7 mm PMSF) for 3 h. After dialysis, extracts were centrifuged (30,000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatant was stored as aliquots in liquid nitrogen. The protein concentration in each extract was measured using the Bradford assay (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-SATB1 antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. T. Kohwi-Shigematsu (Burnham Institute, University of California, Berkeley, CA) and also produced in our laboratory as described (15Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-CDP/Cux was the kind gift of Dr. Ellis Neufeld (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). EMSA assays were performed essentially as described previously (38Garner M.M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3042-3060Crossref Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 39Landolfi N.F. Capra J.D. Tucker P.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 548-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (1–10 μg) were mixed with poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (1–2 μg) in 10–30 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, and 30 mm PMSF). End-labeled probe (0.002–0.008 pmol/5000 cpm) was added 5 min later, and after incubation for 20 min at room temperature, 1 μl of dye was added to each tube. The mixtures were applied to a 4% polyacrylamide gel (29:1) in 1 × TEB buffer (0.09 m Tris, 0.09 m boric acid, 0.002m EDTA) and subjected to electrophoresis for an appropriate period at 10 V/cm. The gel was dried and autoradiographed overnight at −70 °C using an intensifying screen. For competition experiments, specific and nonspecific competitor DNAs (0.002–0.8 pmol) were added to the nuclear extracts before addition of radiolabeled probe. For distamycin A studies, distamycin A (Sigma) was added to nuclear extracts to the desired concentration before the addition of radiolabeled probe. For antibody inhibition experiments, 2 μl of various dilutions of preimmune rabbit serum, anti-SATB1 antiserum or anti-CDP/Cux antiserum were added to the nuclear extracts before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. Calf thymus nuclear extract (600 mg) was prepared from fresh calf thymus using a modification of the protocols of Wang and Speck (40Wang S. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and Dignam et al. (36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) that employed additional protease inhibitors described by Thornell et al. (41Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundstrom T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1625-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After ammonium sulfate precipitation (50% saturation), the extract was fractionated by four successive columns as described below. Protein was quantitated using the assay of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and individual fractions were assayed for L2a-P1-like activity by EMSA using a portion of the L2a element (the 100(L) fragment; Ref. 19Lee W.-H. Banan M. Harriss J.V. Hwang I. Woodward E. Youn J.J. Gottlieb P.D. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1307-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as the radiolabeled probe: 1) DEAE-cellulose chromatography (Sigma) (100-ml bed volume) run at pH 7.9 and 4 °C and eluted with a linear gradient of from 0.1m to 0.5 m KCl (200 ml each) containing 20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, and 2 mm EDTA; 2) heparin-Sepharose CL-6B chromatography (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., 17-046701) (40-ml bed volume) run under the same conditions with the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 m KCl to 1.0 m KCl (100 ml each); 3) DNA-cellulose chromatography (Sigma, D8515) (20-ml bed volume) run as above and eluted with a gradient of from 0.1 m KCl to 1.0 m KCl (50 ml each); and 4) affinity chromatography on a column containing 200 mg of multimerized 200(L+S) fragment containing the L2a element, which had been conjugated to Sepharose 4B. Trimers of the 200(L+S) fragment were ligated to yield a mixture of fragments in the range of 20–50 kb and conjugated to 2 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose essentially as described previously (42Kadonaga J.T. Tijan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). The washed column (8-ml bed volume) was loaded with 20 ml of the above buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, 0.5 mg of protein, and 100 mg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). 20 ml of buffer containing 100 mg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and 0.1m KCl was then passed through the column at 30 ml/h, and 1 ml fractions were collected. 2-ml volumes of the same buffer containing increments of 0.1 m in KCl concentration (from 0.2m to 0.9 m) were then passed through, followed by 6 ml of buffer containing 1.0 m KCl. Fractions 52–55 eluted from the L2a affinity column at 0.5–0.7 m KCl had significant probe binding activity and contained major components with molecular masses of approximately 100 kDa upon SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The peak fraction (fraction 53) was used for EMSA analysis and Western blotting (see “Results”), and fraction 54 was subjected to microsequence analysis as described below. Following SDS-PAGE and detection of the stained bands with Coomassie Blue, fraction 54 was subjected to in-gel digestion, and peptides were prepared for HPLC separation essentially as described previously (43Collins K. Kobayashi R. Greider C.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 677-686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC (Hewlett-Packard 1090) using a Vydac C18 column (2.1 × 250 mm, 5 micron, 300A). Peptides were eluted with an increasing gradient of acetonitrile/2-propanol (3:1 mix) and absorbance was monitored at 214, 295, and 550 nm. Amino acids sequence analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer ABI model 477 sequencer with on-line HPLC analysis of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives. For radiolabeling with [35S]methionine, cells (5 × 106/ml) were cultured for 1 h in methionine-free DMEM medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% dialyzed FCS. [35S]Methionine (Trans35S-Label, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) was added to a concentration of 200 μCi/ml, and cells were incubated for 4–5 h. After washing with methionine-free medium in the absence of FCS, cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A). Lysates were centrifuged (4 °C, 12,000 rpm, 10 min), and the supernatants were cleared with pansorbin cells (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Precleared lysates were incubated (1 h) with 5 μl of preimmune serum or anti-SATB1 antiserum and then with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) for 1 h. Washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in SDS sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. For radiolabeling with [32P]orthophosphate, cells (5 × 106/ml) were cultured for 4 h in phosphate-free medium (Sigma). [32P]Orthophosphate (ICN Pharmaceuticals) was added to a concentration of 1 mCi/ml, and the cells were incubated for 2 h. After washing in phosphate-free medium, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing the phosphatase inhibitors orthovanadate (0.1 mm) and β-glycerolphosphate (50 mm) and immunoprecipitated with preimmune or anti-SATB1 antiserum as described above. The missing nucleoside experiment was performed essentially as described by Hayes and Tullius (44Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9521-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Each DNA fragment was radiolabeled at one end of one strand only as indicated in the figure legends and subjected to hydroxyradical treatment by adding 10 μl of 0.2 mm(NH4)2FeSO4/0.4 mmEDTA/3% H2O2/10 mml-ascorbate, to 70 μl (300 ng) of labeled fragment. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with 15 μl of 0.1 m thiourea/32 μl of 0.2m EDTA. The reaction mixture was precipitated with 10 μg of yeast tRNA, 20 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, and 750 μl of ethanol, redissolved in water, and precipited a second time with ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in 120 μl of 50 mmTris, pH 7.8. Multiple binding reactions were done as described above using 5 μl of probe and 10–15 μg of nuclear extract and electrophoresed in 10 lanes of a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 180 V for the appropriate amount of time. The gel was exposed wet for 2–3 h, and the retarded bands and free probe were excised from nine lanes essentially as described previously (45Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). One lane was kept as reference. The probes were eluted from the gel by the crush and soak method using 0.2 m NaCl-TE as described by Dickinsonet al. (15Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The samples were electrophoresed on an 8% sequencing gel together with probes subjected to hydroxyradical treatment (control lane) or Maxam-Gilbert sequencing reactions (45Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar) at 55 W for the appropriate amount of time. The gel was fixed in 10% methanol/acetic acid, dried, and exposed for 1–2 days to x-ray film at −70 °C. DNase I footprinting of the isolated bands was performed essentially as described by Landolfi et al. (46Landolfi N.F. Capra J.D. Tucker P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3851-3855Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Ten EMSA reactions were performed as described above using approximately 5 ng of labeled probe and 6–7 μg of nuclear extract per tube. Also added to each reaction mix was 2–3 μl of 100 mm Mg2+/Ca2+ for the subsequent DNase I digestion. The reactions were incubated for 20 min, 1–2 μl of a 200 ng/ml DNase I solution was added to each tube, and the reaction mix was incubated for an additional 5 min. The DNase I digestion was subsequently quenched with 1 μl of 100 mmEDTA. The reactions were electrophoresed on a 4% PAGE at 180 V for the appropriate amount of time and exposed wet for 2–3 h, and the retarded bands and free probe were excised from nine lanes with one lane being kept as a reference. The samples were eluted by the crush and soak method and electrophoresed on an 8% sequencing gel as described above for the missing nucleoside reaction. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the pALTER™ system (Promega, Madison, WI) essentially as described by the manufacturer. The SalI site in the polycloning site of pALTER-1 was changed to HpaI by site-directed mutagenesis. A 1.2-kb XbaI/HpaI fragment containing the L2a element was cloned into the XbaI and HpaI sites of pALTER-1. Site-directed mutagenesis was then performed, and AccI/BstXI fragments representing mutant 200(L+S) regions were subcloned into pUC18 and subjected to automated nucleotide sequence analysis to verify their sequences. In some instances, further deletions were introduced into these subclones using StyI sites present in the genomic DNA and/or a BclI site introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. Fragments for use as probes in EMSA studies were excised using restriction sites in the polylinker. RNA isolation using guanidine isothiocyanate and Northern hybridizations were performed essentially as described previously (45Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). AnEcoRV/XbaI fragment containing the full-length mouse SATB1 cDNA was excised from the pmAT plasmid (47Nakagomi K. Kohwi Y. Dickinson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1852-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), made blunt ended using Klenow fragment, and cloned into the SmaI site of the pECH expression vector to produce the pECH-mSATB1 construct. Both the pmAT and pECH vectors were the kind gifts of Dr. T. Kohwi-Shigematsu. The pECH vector contains the major PvuII fragment from pBluescript and the SV40 sequences and multicloning site from the pECE plasmid (48Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Electroporation was performed essentially as described previously (49Potter H. Weir L. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

https://openalex.org/W2022912764,"The c-fes proto-oncogene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase (Fes) that has been implicated in cytokine receptor signal transduction and myeloid differentiation. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that Fes autophosphorylates via an intermolecular mechanism more commonly associated with growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. Analysis of the Fes amino acid sequence with the COILS algorithm indicates that the N-terminal region of the protein has a very high probability of forming coiled-coil structures often associated with oligomeric proteins. These findings suggest that oligomerization may be a prerequisite for trans-autophosphorylation and activation of Fes. To establish whether the active form of Fes is oligomeric, we performed gel-filtration experiments with recombinant Fes and found that it eluted as a single symmetrical peak of approximately 500 kDa. No evidence of the monomeric, 93-kDa form of the protein was observed. Deletion of the unique N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–450, including the coiled-coil homology region) completely abolished the formation of oligomers. Furthermore, co-precipitation assays demonstrated that an immobilized glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing the Fes N-terminal region bound to full-length Fes but not to a mutant lacking the N-terminal region. Similarly, a recombinant Fes N-terminal domain protein was readily cross-linked in vitro, whereas the SH2 and kinase domains were refractory to cross-linking. Incubation of wild-type Fes with a kinase-inactive Fes mutant or with the isolated N-terminal region suppressed Fes autophosphorylation in vitro, suggesting that oligomerization may be essential for autophosphorylation of full-length Fes.

The presence of an oligomerization function in the Fes family of tyrosine kinases suggests a novel mechanism for non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase regulation. The c-fes proto-oncogene encodes a non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (Fes) that is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells (1Smithgall T.E. Yu G. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15050-15055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Feldman R.A. Gabrilove J.L. Tam J.P. Moore M.A.S. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several lines of evidence suggest that Fes may influence myeloid differentiation commitment. Transfection of the myeloid leukemia cell line K-562 with c-Fes resulted in growth suppression and terminal differentiation (4Yu G. Smithgall T.E. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10276-10281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). K-562 cells are derived from chronic myelogenous leukemia and express the p210 form of Bcr/Abl but not Fes. In this context, restoration of Fes is sufficient to suppress transformation by Bcr/Abl in addition to generating a more differentiated phenotype. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that normal Bcr is a substrate for Fes and suggest that Fes may interact directly with Bcr/Abl as well (5Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Li J. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32930-32936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In related studies, an activated viral homolog of Fes (v-Fps) was shown to induce differentiation of chicken bone marrow cells to mature macrophages in the absence of CSF-1 (7Carmier J.F. Samarut J. Cell. 1986; 44: 159-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of Fes is sufficient to induce terminal differentiation of normal as well as leukemic progenitor cells. Although Fes was originally thought to be restricted to hematopoietic cells, more recent work has uncovered a broader pattern of expression. First, studies of c-fes expression in developing mouse embryos showed that it was not only present in hematopoietic cells but also in non-hematopoietic tissues where expression is not observed in the adult (8Carè A. Mattia G. Montesoro E. Parolini I. Russo G. Colombo M.P. Peschle C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 739-747PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, c-fes transcripts were detected in embryonic lung, liver, spinal cord, skin, gut, heart, and kidney. These results suggest that Fes may play a critical role in the early development of many tissues in addition to its role in hematopoiesis. A second study reports the surprising finding that Fes may be involved in the regulation of the vascular endothelium. Expression of an activated form of Fes in transgenic mice induced hypervascularity which progressed to multifocal hemangiomas (9Greer P. Haigh J. Mbamalu G. Khoo W. Bernstein A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6755-6763Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Expression of endogenous Fes was also observed in primary human vascular endothelial cells at levels comparable to those detected in myeloid cells. These results show that in addition to hematopoietic cells, Fes expression is also intrinsic to cells of the vascular endothelial lineage and imply that Fes may play a role in angiogenesis. A more recent study demonstrated Fes expression in other adult tissues, including neuronal and epithelial cells (10Haigh J. McVeigh J. Greer P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 931-944PubMed Google Scholar). The function of Fes in these tissues is currently unknown. A common feature of receptor tyrosine kinases is that they are activated by oligomerization in response to ligand binding (11Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 12Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19 (abstr.): 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The oligomerized receptor is then capable of trans-autophosphorylation, which is essential for downstream signaling through the recruitment of effector proteins with SH2 domains (13Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar, 14Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The mechanism regulating the kinase activity of Fes and other non-receptor tyrosine kinases is less clear. Fes tyrosine kinase activity is tightly regulated in cells, and even under conditions of overexpression, very little tyrosine autophosphorylation is observed (3MacDonald I. Levy J. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Greer P.A. Meckling-Hansen K. Pawson T. Mol. Cell.

Tyrosine autophosphorylation of Fes appears to be essential for biochemical activation and biological function, as c-Fes and v-Fps mutants with Phe substitutions of the major autophosphorylation site show reduced enzymatic and biological activity (16Rogers J.A.

Recently, we demonstrated that Fes autophosphorylation occurs by an intermolecular mechanism, suggesting that Fes activation occurs as a result of transphosphorylation in a manner analogous to receptor tyrosine kinases (16Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea is the observation that Fes associates with multiple hematopoietic cytokine receptors and is activated in response to cytokine binding (20Hanazono Y. Chiba S. Sasaki K.

Alternatively, Fes may have an intrinsic oligomerization capacity that may drive autophosphorylation and activation. In this study, we demonstrate that the Fes tyrosine kinase is an oligomeric protein. Amino acid sequences found in the unique N-terminal domain mediate oligomerization and exhibit striking homology to coiled-coil domains associated with other classes of oligomeric proteins (28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar, 29Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observed that a kinase-inactive mutant of Fes as well as the isolated N-terminal region were able to associate with wild-type Fes and suppress autophosphorylation, consistent with a model for Fes activation that requires oligomerization and trans-autophosphorylation. The presence of an oligomerization domain in Fes suggests a novel mechanism for regulation of its protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Expression of Fes wild-type, K590E, Y713F, ΔN, ΔSH2, ΔKIN, and isolated N-terminal proteins with C-terminal FLAG epitope tags using the baculovirus/Sf-9 cell system is described in detail elsewhere (5Maru Y.

The expression of the Fes N-terminal domain as well as full-length Fes as GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. fusion proteins (GST-N-Fes and GST-Fes, respectively) in Sf-9 cells has also been described (16Rogers J.A.

To create the ΔN-KE Fes mutant, a uniqueKpnI/EcoRI restriction fragment was isolated from the Fes K590E mutant cDNA (17Hjermstad S. Peters K.L. Briggs S.D. Glazer R.I. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2283-2292PubMed Google Scholar) and swapped with the corresponding fragment in the wild-type ΔN mutant. The resulting ΔN-KE Fes cDNA was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 and used to generate a recombinant baculovirus as described elsewhere (16Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J.

A Sephacryl S-300 column (1.5 × 75 cm) was equilibrated with S-300 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2) and calibrated with thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa). Sf-9 cells expressing full-length Fes-FLAG (16Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol.

The clarified supernatant (0.5 ml) was applied to the S-300 column and eluted with S-300 buffer at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Fractions (1.0 ml) were collected and the position of Fes in the elution profile was determined by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (IBI/Kodak) as described elsewhere (16Rogers J.A.

Similar gel-filtration procedures were used for the Fes ΔN and N-terminal proteins, except a Sephacryl S-200 column was employed (1.0 × 100 cm); 0.5-ml fractions were collected and standard proteins included catalase, bovine serum albumin, and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). The Fes amino acid sequence was analyzed using the COILS algorithm (28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar, 29Lupas A.

A gliding window of 28 residues was used for the analysis presented. A detailed description of the program is available.2 Sf-9 cells were co-infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding the Fes N-terminal region fused to GST (GST-N-Fes) and wild-type or mutant Fes proteins with the FLAG epitope fused to their C termini. Forty-eight hours postinfection, cells were lysed by sonication as described (16Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the GST-N-Fes protein was precipitated with glutathione-agarose. The glutathione-agarose beads were washed with RIPA buffer (16Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the presence of associated Fes was detected by immunoblotting with antibodies to the FLAG epitope (M2 antibody). As a negative control, parallel experiments were conducted in which Fes proteins were co-expressed with GST. Expression of GST and GST-N-Fes was verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining of an aliquot of each glutathione-agarose precipitate. The Fes N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–450) and the SH2/kinase region (amino acids 451–822) were expressed as FLAG fusion proteins in Sf-9 cells. Cells were lysed by sonication (16Rogers J.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and diluted 1:10 with lysis buffer, and the bifunctional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was added from a concentrated stock solution in Me2SO to final concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 mm. The reactions were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and were stopped by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The effect of the cross-linker on the Fes proteins was analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to the FLAG epitope. Parallel incubations with Me2SO alone were run as a negative control. Lysates from Sf-9 cells expressing a GST-Fes fusion protein, a kinase-inactive mutant of Fes (Fes-KE) (17Hjermstad S. Peters K.L. Briggs S.D. Glazer R.I. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2283-2292PubMed Google Scholar), the isolated Fes N-terminal domain, or a kinase-inactive N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN-KE) were mixed in various ratios and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Fes proteins were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) in 40 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2) for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and phosphorylated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Relative protein levels were quantitated by two-dimensional laser densitometry of the Coomassie-stained gel. The relative extent of autophosphorylation of GST-Fes was analyzed by storage phosphor technology (Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager). GST-Fes autophosphorylation was corrected for protein levels and is plotted as percent of control activity observed in the absence of the added mutant Fes proteins. To investigate the interaction of GST-Fes with Fes-KE, N-terminal, and ΔN-KE, Sf-9 cells were co-infected with GST-Fes (or GST as a negative control) and each of these mutants. GST-Fes and GST were precipitated from infected cell lysates, and associated Fes proteins were detected by immunoblotting as described above. Recent work from our laboratory demonstrated that Fes autophosphorylation occurs by an intermolecular mechanism (16Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that Fes activation may require oligomerization in a manner analogous to growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (11Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar, 12Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19 (abstr.): 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Gel-filtration experiments were conducted to determine whether the active form of Fes is oligomeric. Recombinant Fes was expressed in Sf-9 insect cells, and clarified lysates from the infected cells were applied to a Sephacryl S-300 column calibrated with thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa). The position of Fes in the elution profile was determined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, Fes eluted from the column as a single oligomeric peak of approximately 500 kDa. No peak was observed in 93-kDa range, which corresponds to the unit molecular mass of Fes. This result clearly shows that the active form of Fes is oligomeric. The Fes kinase has a modular structure consisting of unique N-terminal, SH2, and kinase domains. To determine which regions of the protein contribute to oligomerization, Sephacryl S-200 gel-filtration experiments were performed on recombinant Fes proteins either lacking the unique N-terminal domain (ΔN; Fig. 1 B) or on the isolated N-terminal region itself without the SH2 and kinase domains (N-term; Fig. 1 C). The Fes N-terminal deletion mutant eluted from the column as a monomer of approximately 40 kDa, indicating that the SH2 and kinase domains are not involved in oligomerization. By contrast, the N-terminal region was exclusively oligomeric, with no evidence for the 50-kDa monomeric form of this protein. These data suggest that structural features found within the unique N-terminal domain regulate oligomerization of the Fes molecule. Coiled-coil domains often mediate protein oligomerization (31Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). This structural element is comprised of an amphipathic α-helix with a characteristic heptad repeat in which the first and fourth positions are occupied by hydrophobic amino acids. As a result, these residues are positioned on the same face of the helix and pack together to form a hydrophobic core. The remaining amino acids are often hydrophilic and allow for solvation of the structure. To determine whether a coiled-coil domain exists within the Fes protein, we analyzed the Fes amino acid sequence using the COILS algorithm (28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar, 29Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This program measures the probability that a given amino acid and its surrounding sequence exists as an amphipathic α-helix capable of forming a coiled-coil and plots the result against the amino acid position in the sequence. As shown in Fig. 2, a region spanning Fes N-terminal amino acids 128–169 is predicted by the program to have a nearly absolute probability of forming a coiled-coil structure, consistent with the gel-filtration results (Fig. 1). Other regions within the N-terminal domain were also predicted to possess coiled-coil forming motifs, although with lower probability relative to the 128–169 region. By contrast, the SH2 and kinase domains are essentially devoid of any predicted coiled-coil domains. As shown in more detail below, the prediction that the unique N-terminal region of Fes confers its oligomeric structure is confirmed by several additional lines of experimental evidence. As described above, gel-filtration experiments and computer analysis suggest that the Fes N-terminal region is responsible for oligomerization of the protein. To test this hypothesis further, a GST fusion protein containing the N-terminal region of Fes (or GST alone as a negative control) was co-expressed with Fes in a baculovirus/Sf-9 cell system. The GST-N-terminal fusion protein was precipitated from the co-infected cell lysates with glutathione-agarose and the presence of associated Fes was determined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.3, the GST-N-Fes fusion protein readily associated with full-length Fes in the co-precipitation assay, whereas no association was observed with GST itself. This result provides direct evidence that the Fes N-terminal region is capable of protein-protein interactions and is likely to mediate the oligomerization of Fes. To identify the region of the Fes protein that associates with the GST-N-terminal fusion protein, co-precipitation experiments were conducted using deletion mutants of Fes lacking the N-terminal (ΔN), SH2 (ΔSH2), or kinase (ΔKIN) domains. As shown in Fig. 3, the ΔSH2 and ΔKIN mutants readily associated with the Fes N-terminal region, indicating that these domains are dispensable for oligomerization. By contrast, the ΔN mutant was unable to associate with the GST-N-terminal domain fusion protein, indicating that the N-terminal region contains the structural elements essential for oligomerization to occur. We also investigated whether the phosphorylation state of Fes influenced oligomerization using the co-precipitation assay. For these experiments, we used a kinase-inactive mutant of Fes with a glutamic acid residue in place of the critical lysine residue in the ATP binding site (K590E mutant) (17Hjermstad S. Peters K.L. Briggs S.D. Glazer R.I. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2283-2292PubMed Google Scholar) as well as a mutant with a phenylalanine in place of tyrosine at the major autophosphorylation site (Y713F mutant). As shown in Fig. 3, both of these mutants readily associated with the Fes N-terminal fusion protein, indicating that kinase activity is not required for oligomerization to occur. Chemical cross-linking experiments were also performed as an alternative method to demonstrate the Fes domain responsible for oligomerization. The Fes N-terminal domain and the SH2/kinase region were expressed independently as FLAG fusion proteins in Sf-9 cells. Lysates from the cells were diluted 1:10 and incubated in the presence and absence of the bifunctional cross-linking reagent DSS. The reactions were stopped with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed for the presence of cross-linked products by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.4, cross-linking of the N-terminal region of the Fes protein resulted in the formation of a new band of approximately 150 kDa, approximately three times the unit molecular mass of this domain and somewhat lower than anticipated based on the gel-filtration results that are consistent with at least a pentameric molecule. This difference may be due to artifactually high electrophoretic mobility of the cross-linked complex. Identical results were obtained with other cross-linking reagents with longer or shorter spacer arms and with DSS concentrations as low as 0.1 mm (data not shown). By contrast, no cross-linking was observed with the SH2-kinase portion of Fes under any of these conditions. These results are in good agreement with the gel-filtration and GST-N-Fes co-precipitation experiments as well as the N-terminal localization of coiled-coil motifs by the COILS program (Fig. 2). We also performed cross-linking experiments on the full-length Fes molecule. A new band of much higher molecular mass was observed following incubation of Fes with the cross-linking reagent. Because of the very low electrophoretic mobility of the cross-linked product, estimation of its molecular mass was not possible (data not shown). Gel-filtration, co-precipitation, and chemical cross-linking data presented above demonstrate that Fes is capable of oligomerization, which may be mediated via coiled-coil oligomerization motifs localized to the unique N-terminal domain. Previous work from our laboratory shows that autophosphorylation of Fes is intermolecular and is required for full activation of the kinase (16Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Hjermstad S. Peters K.L. Briggs S.D. Glazer R.I. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2283-2292PubMed Google Scholar). If oligomerization is required for Fes kinase activation and the mechanism is intermolecular, then co-expression of Fes with a kinase-inactive mutant would be predicted to suppress autophosphorylation by forming oligomers incapable of maximal transphosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we expressed full-length Fes as a GST fusion protein as well as the kinase-inactive form of Fes (Fes-KE) independently in Sf-9 cells. Clarified lysates from the infected cells were mixed together in various ratios, and the resulting protein complexes were immunoprecipitated and the extent of GST-Fes autophosphorylation was measured by addition of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig.5 A, the autophosphorylation capacity of Fes decreased in proportion to the amount of the kinase-inactive mutant added to the reaction. This result supports the hypothesis that oligomerization and transphosphorylation are necessary for Fes autophosphorylation to occur. To demonstrate that the kinase inhibition shown in Fig. 5 Ais dependent upon the Fes N-terminal domain, similar in vitro kinase assays were performed with GST-Fes following incubation with either the isolated N-terminal domain or a kinase-inactive Fes mutant lacking the N-terminal region (ΔN-KE). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the N-terminal region alone was sufficient to suppress GST-Fes autophosphorylation, and the ΔN-KE mutant was without effect. Data shown in Fig. 5 suggest that GST-Fes and the kinase-inactive mutant form mixed oligomers. To test this possibility, lysates from Sf-9 cells co-expressing GST-Fes and Fes-KE, the Fes N-terminal region or ΔN-KE were incubated with glutathione-agarose. Following incubation and washing, GST-Fes-associated proteins were visualized by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 6, Fes-KE as well as the isolated N-terminal region readily co-precipitated with GST-Fes, whereas the ΔN-KE mutant did not. None of these proteins bound to GST alone. These results are consistent with the conclusion that mixed oligomer formation is required for the inhibition of kinase activity by the kinase-inactive Fes mutants. Data presented in this paper demonstrate for the first time that the c-Fes tyrosine kinase is an oligomeric protein and are consistent with a model for Fes activation that requires oligomerization and transphosphorylation. Gel-filtration, chemical cross-linking, and co-precipitation experiments all clearly demonstrate the intrinsic capacity of Fes to form oligomers. Gel-filtration experiments suggest that full-length Fes is capable of forming large oligomers containing as many as five Fes molecules (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, gel-filtration of the isolated N-terminal domain of Fes suggests the capacity for formation of at least pentameric structures (Fig.1 C). By contrast, cross-linking studies (Fig. 4) suggest that the isolated Fes N-terminal domain forms homotrimers and are consistent with a previous report for the Fes-related tyrosine kinase, Fer (32Kim L. Wong T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This difference may be due to the artifactually high migration rate of the cross-linked molecule on SDS-PAGE gels. Alternatively, the oligomeric state of Fes may be variable and may be influenced by the presence of other molecules that bind to Fes such as Bcr (5Maru Y. Peters K.L. Afar D.E.H. Shibuya M. Witte O.N. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 835-842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data clearly indicate that the unique N-terminal region is responsible for the oligomerization of Fes. Computer analysis of this region shows the presence of a heptad repeat pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids typical of coiled-coil oligomerization domains (31Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). One of these regions (amino acids 128–169) scored with a near absolute probability of being a coiled-coil former. A small FLAG fusion protein containing this putative coiled-coil domain was readily cross-linked by DSS, producing dimers, trimers, and tetramers (data not shown). Other potential coiled-coil-forming sequences were also detected by the COILS program, although with lower probability. The possibility that Fes may contain more than one coiled-coil domain suggests a mode of kinase regulation involving interconversion of a monomeric, inactive form of the protein with the oligomeric, active form of the protein observed here. A precedent for this type of regulation is provided by the heat shock transcription factor, HSF-1 (33Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this case, the latent form of the protein has been proposed to exist as a monomer, in which its multiple coiled-coil domains are occupied via intrastrand interactions that may be stabilized via interactions with HSP70. Activation of the protein by heat stress results in formation of a homotrimer via a triple-stranded coiled-coil structure; this trimeric form of the protein shows greatly enhanced affinity for DNA. In the case of Fes, interaction with a host factor may suppress kinase activity in intact cells by preventing formation of the active oligomer. As with HSF-1, Fes has recently been shown to interact with HSP70 and other molecular chaperones (34Nair S.C. Toran E.J. Rimerman R.A. Hjermstad S. Smithgall T.E. Smith D.F. Cell Stress and Chaperones. 1996; 1: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Oligomerization domains have also been implicated in the biological activation of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in various human leukemias. The best characterized example is Bcr/Abl, the chimeric oncoprotein that results from the Philadelphia chromosome translocation first associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (35Sawyers C.L. Cancer Surv. 1992; 15: 37-51PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal, Bcr-derived portion of Bcr/Abl mediates the formation of large oligomeric Bcr/Abl complexes (36McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 37Pendergast A.M. Clark R. Kawasaki E.S. McCormick F.P. Witte O.N. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 759-766PubMed Google Scholar). A specific Bcr domain with homology to coiled-coil oligomerization sequences (amino acids 1–63) has been shown to mediate homotetramer formation in vitro (36McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Tetramerization of Bcr/Abl via this domain correlates with F-actin binding, leading to association of Bcr/Abl with the actin cytoskeleton. Oligomerization has been proposed to enhance the affinity of Bcr/Abl for F-actin via the Abl C-terminal F-actin binding domain (38McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the Bcr-derived oligomerization domain impairs both F-actin binding and transforming activity, suggesting that formation of Bcr/Abl oligomers and F-actin localization are required for transformation (38McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 39McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another chromosomal translocation associated with myeloid leukemia has been reported recently that activates Abl by a similar mechanism (40Golub T.R. Goga A. Barker G.F. Afar D.E.H. McLaughlin J. Bohlander S.K. Rowley J.D. Witte O.N. Gilliland D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4107-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This translocation event fuses c-Abl to the N-terminal region of the TEL transcription factor, resulting in oligomerization, kinase activation, and cytoskeletal localization. Thus, oligomerization may represent an important activating mechanism for both normal and transforming tyrosine kinases of the non-receptor class."

https://openalex.org/W2050691635,"Knowledge of the production history of cosmogenic nuclides, which is needed for geological and archaeological dating, has been uncertain. Measurements of chlorine-36/chlorine ( 36 Cl/Cl) ratios in fossil packrat middens from Nevada that are radiocarbon-dated between about 38 thousand years ago (ka) and the present showed that 36 Cl/Cl ratios were higher by a factor of about 2 before ∼11 ka. This raises the possibility that cosmogenic production rates just before the close of the Pleistocene were up to 50% higher than is suggested by carbon-14 calibration data. The discrepancy could be explained by addition of low–carbon-14 carbon dioxide to the atmosphere during that period, which would have depressed atmospheric radiocarbon activity. Alternatively, climatic effects on 36 Cl deposition may have enhanced the 36 Cl/Cl ratios."
https://openalex.org/W2001415405,"The epithelial brush border Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) is regulated by growth factors and protein kinases. When stably expressed in PS120 fibroblasts, NHE3 is stimulated by serum and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and inhibited by phorbol esters. To examine the role of phosphorylation of NHE3 in growth factor/protein kinase regulation, NHE3 was C-terminally tagged with an 11-amino acid epitope of the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) and stably expressed in Na+/H+ exchanger null PS120 fibroblasts (PS120/NHE3V). NHE3V was regulated by serum, FGF, and phorbol ester in a manner identical to wild type non-VSVG-tagged NHE3. Phosphorylation of NHE3V was evaluated via immunoprecipitation with anti-VSVG antibody after in vivo labeling of PS120/NHE3V cells with [32P]orthophosphate. NHE3V was phosphorylated under basal conditions. However, FGF and PMA, under conditions in which these agonists regulate NHE3V, altered neither the amount of phosphorylation of NHE3V as analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography nor two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of tryptic digests of NHE3V. In contrast, while changes in NHE3V phosphorylation were not observed with serum exposure by one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two-dimensional studies showed increases in two phosphopeptides. Under all these conditions, phosphoamino acid analysis showed that NHE3V was phosphorylated only on serine residues. By cell surface protein biotinylation studies under basal conditions, at least 27% of the NHE3V was expressed on the cell surface. To further analyze the phosphorylation status of the surface and intracellular forms of NHE3V under basal conditions and determine whether the amount of phosphorylation of the surface form changes upon serum, FGF, and PMA regulation, the surface form of NHE3V was separated from intracellular form by biotinylation/avidin-agarose precipitation. Under basal conditions, both intracellular and surface forms of NHE3V were phosphorylated. However, the amount of phosphorylation of the surface form of NHE3V did not change upon stimulation by serum and FGF and inhibition by PMA based on one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Thus, we conclude that when expressed in PS120 cells, while NHE3 is a phosphoprotein under basal conditions, its regulation by FGF and PMA is not by changes in the phosphorylation of NHE3, while regulation by serum may involve changes in its phosphorylation. Regulation of NHE3 probably involves intermediate associated regulatory proteins. The function of basal phosphorylation of NHE3 is not known.

Five mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms have been identified with different tissue distributions and functional properties (2Yun C.H.C. Tse C.M. Nath S. Levine S.A. Brant S.R. Donowitz M. Am. J.

Menon A.G. Genomic. 1995; 25: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and three of these have been expressed and characterized in detail (NHE1, NHE2, NHE3). By Northern blot analysis and immunocytochemistry, NHE1 is present in nearly all cell types and is localized to the basolateral surfaces of renal and intestinal polarized epithelial cells (4Tse C.M. Ma A.I. Yang V.W. Watson A.J.M. Levine S. Montrose M.H. Potter J. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Donowitz M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1957-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), whereas NHE2 and NHE3 are predominantly epithelial and are co-localized to the brush border of these cells (5Hoogerwerf W.A. Tsao S.C. Devuyst O. Levine S.A. Yun C.H.C. Yip J.W. Cohen M.E. Wilson P.D. Lazenby A.J. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G29-G41PubMed Google Scholar). NHE3 is stimulated by FGF, serum, and okadaic acid but inhibited by phorbol esters and by calmodulin, the latter under basal [Ca2+] i conditions (6Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J.

Unlike NHE1, the regulation of NHE3 is through changes in the maximum exchange rate (V max) rather than an alteration inK′(H i +) (9Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9331-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At a protein level, NHE1 and NHE3 share 50–60% identity in amino acid sequences in the N-terminal transmembrane domain (9Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9331-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tse C.-M. Brant S.R. Walker S.M. Pouyssegur J. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail, which is the main area for regulatory function and contains multiple putative protein kinase consensus sites, however, is very different, with only 20–30% amino acid identity (9Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9331-9339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tse C.-M. Brant S.R. Walker S.M. Pouyssegur J. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9340-9346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like NHE1, in the absence of ATP, basal Na+/H+exchange activity of NHE3 is greatly decreased and growth factor/protein kinase regulation ceases (6Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NHE3 is, either directly or indirectly, regulated by phosphorylation. Okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, increases the V max of NHE3, which implies a basal phosphorylated state of at least some proteins involved in NHE3 regulation. Conversely, genistein, a tyrosine kinase blocker, inhibits basal Na+/H+ exchange activity, which suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved in stimulation of basal Na+/H+ exchange (8Levine S.A.

In addition, by performing C-terminal truncations of NHE3 and expressing the truncated cDNAs in PS120 cells, several separate subdomains of the cytoplasmic C terminus of NHE3 were identified, including areas responsible for regulation by calmodulin, phorbol ester, okadaic acid, FGF, and serum (8Levine S.A.

NHE3 is phosphorylated under basal conditions, and this has been shown for NHE3 stably transfected in PS120 cells and in another fibroblast cell line, AP-1 cells (11Moe A. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both the PS120 cells and AP-1 cells are deficient in endogenous NHEs (12Pouyssegur J. Sardet C. Franchi A. L'Allemain G.

The amount of phosphorylation of NHE3 increases with cAMP inhibition of NHE3 in AP-1 cells (11Moe A. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the present study, we determine whether stimulation of NHE3 by FGF and inhibition of this protein by phorbol ester are associated with or are due to changes in phosphorylation of NHE3 stably expressed in PS120 cells. These regulators were compared with serum with its mixed growth factors. This study was also designed to separate the cell surface and intracellular forms of NHE3 and to determine whether changes in the rate of Na+/H+ exchange by NHE3 as caused by protein kinases/growth factors are associated with changes in cell surface NHE3 phosphorylation. [32P]Orthophosphoric acid was from NEN Life Science Products. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Corp. (Logan, UT), basic FGF was from Boehringer Mannheim, and the rest of the reagents were purchased from Sigma.

Pouyssegur) and NHE3V- (NHE3 epitope tagged with an 11-amino acid VSVG epitope; see below) transfected PS120 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mm Hepes, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 5% CO2. Acid killing and G418 (400 μg/ml) selections were applied to NHE3V-transfected PS120 cells as described previously to maintain high Na+/H+ exchange activity (6Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M.

To construct the VSVG epitope tag on the C terminus of NHE3 (NHE3V), we made use of an NHE3 truncation mutant, E3/585, which had been VSVG-tagged on the C terminus. E3/585 is a cDNA of NHE3 truncated from the C terminus at amino acid 585. Briefly, E3/585V cDNA was obtained by cleaving the untagged E3/585 cDNA from the pMAMneo vector with BamHI and XhoI. ThisBamHI/XhoI cassette was subcloned into the 5′-end of the VSVG tag sequence in pBluescript (kindly provided by Dr. D. Louvard). The XhoI site was retained at the boundary of the VSVG tag sequence and the E3/585 cDNA. The tag sequence, when translated, contained an 8-amino acid spacer arm sequence (RGEGPPGP) followed by the 11-amino acid VSVG epitope (YTDIEMNRLGK). To obtain the E3V/pBluescript construct, a 0.9-kilobase pair NHE3 C terminus cDNA fragment (nucleotides 1536–2496, corresponding to amino acids 522–832) was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using the paired primers (5′ primer, GTCGGCCAGAAGTCTCGG; 3′ primer, TTTCCTCGAGATGTGTGTGGACTCGGGG) where the 3′ primer contained the NHE3 stop codon mutated into an XhoI site. This polymerase chain reaction fragment was then digested with StuI andXhoI (corresponding to amino acids 581–832) to replace theStuI-XhoI fragment in E3/585V/pBluescript, thus generating NHE3V/pBluescript. The NHE3V cDNA was then subcloned into pMAMneo, generating NHE3V/pMAMneo. PS120 cells were transfected with the NHE3V/pMAMneo construct using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique and then subjected to acid selection 3 days after the transfection. This procedure was repeated every 3–4 days over a period of 3 weeks. Geneticin (800 μg/ml) was present on initial splitting in the cell culture medium to further enhance selection pressure (5Hoogerwerf W.A. Tsao S.C. Devuyst O. Levine S.A. Yun C.H.C. Yip J.W.

Cellular Na+/H+ exchange activity in PS120/NHE3V cells was determined fluorometrically using an intracellular pH-sensitive dye BCECF with a computerized fluorimeter and a perfusion system with cells grown on glass coverslips and serum-starved overnight, as described previously (6Levine S.A.

The effect of 10% dialyzed FBS on NHE3V was studied by the initial rates and at steady-state pH i, as described previously (6Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol.

In these studies, the rate of Na+-dependent alkalinization was obtained by calculating the first order derivative of the Na+-dependent pH recovery curve. The hydrogen ion efflux rate (μm H+/s), equivalent to the rate of Na+/H+ exchange, was then determined by multiplying the rate of change in pH i by the cellular buffering capacity at the corresponding pH i values. Scatter plots of H+ efflux rate versus intracellular [H+] were constructed (6Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Na+/H+exchange rate data were analyzed using a nonlinear regression data analysis program, ENZFITTER (Biosoft Corp.). In each experiment, control cells were studied at the same time in parallel with treated cells (FGF, 10 ng/ml, or PMA, 1 μm) to control for the variability in the basal exchange rate among cells from different cell passages and acid selection. Confluent PS120 or PS120/NHE3V cells grown in 10-cm dishes were washed twice with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were then labeled in vivo for 4 h with 3 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2.5 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate. At the end of the incubation, cells were treated with 10% dialyzed FBS, PMA (1 μm), or FGF (10 ng/ml) for 5 min. It has previously been shown that under such conditions, these growth factors affect Na+/H+exchange by PS120/NHE3 cells (6Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol.

In the present study, we also tested whether these growth factors regulate PS120/NHE3V cells under the conditions used for phosphorylation. Cells were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline at the end of the incubation period and processed immediately for immunoprecipitation. All procedures of immunoprecipitation were performed at 4 °C. The confluent layer of cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described above were scraped and resuspended in 500 μl of 50 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 1 mmphenanthroline, and 1 mm iodoacetamide) (IP buffer) (14Sardet C.

Cells were then collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge and were resuspended in IP buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 (IPT buffer), sonicated for 20 s, and agitated on a rotating rocker at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 30 min to remove insoluble cellular debris. The supernatants were first precleared with Protein A-Sepharose 6M beads by rocking for 1 h. The beads were spun down, and the supernatants were incubated overnight with 5 μl of the anti-VSVG polyclonal antibody. Protein A-Sepharose beads previously treated with PS120 cell extract solubilized by Triton X-100 (1%) were then added and allowed to rock for a further 2 h. The beads were then washed eight times with IPT buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in 70 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. For each sample, an aliquot of 50 μl was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and autoradiography on a dried gel was performed. The phosphoprotein corresponding to NHE3 was further characterized by two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis. The band corresponding to NHE3 was identified by autoradiography and prestained high molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad), excised, and washed (10% methanol, 5% glacial acetic acid and then washed with 50% methanol). The gel pieces were incubated with 0.3 mg/mll-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin in 0.4% NH4HCO3 at 37 °C overnight. The digested proteins were lyophilized and resuspended in 10 μl of H2O and spotted at the origin on thin layer cellulose plates together with 0.5 μl each of the marker dyes, phenol red and basic fuschin. Phosphopeptides were separated by electrophoresis in acetic acid/pyridine/H2O (10:1:89) (pH 3.5, 500 V) in the first dimension until the marker dyes had travelled ∼6 cm from the origin in opposite directions, and then by ascending chromatography in pyridine/butanol/acetic acid/H2O (15:10:3:2) in the second dimension until the marker dyes had ascended to the edge of the thin layer plate. Analysis of the amount of phosphorylation of each phosphopeptide was by use of a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software, with a comparison made by normalization to spots felt not to change in phosphorylation in response to serum, PMA, and FGF, based on preliminary studies. Comparison was by pairedt tests. To determine the identity of the phosphoamino acids of NHE3, 32P-labeled protein was excised from acrylamide gels, treated with trypsin, and lyophilized as described above. The lyophilized protein was further hydrolyzed in 6m HCl under nitrogen at 105 °C for 1 h. The acid-hydrolyzed peptides were relyophilized, resuspended in 10 μl of H2O, and spotted on thin layer cellulose plates with 100 μg each of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine used as internal standards and 0.5 μl of phenol red marker also added at the origin. The plate was subjected to the first phase of electrophoresis in formic acid/acetic acid/H2O, (10:1:89) (pH 1.9, 500 V) until the phenol red had moved ∼5 cm from the origin, and then electrophoresis was continued in the same direction until the marker had travelled another ∼8 cm in another tank containing acetic acid/pyridine/H2O (10:1:89) (pH 3.5, 500 V). The cellulose plates were dried, developed in 1% ninhydrin in acetone to identify the internal phosphoamino acid standards, and then subjected to autoradiography to reveal the 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids. Cell surface biotinylation was performed at 4 °C. PS120/NHE3V cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm Petri dishes. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4) and once in borate buffer (154 mm NaCl, 10 mm boric acid, 7.2 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 9) (17Cottardi C.J.

The surface plasma membrane proteins were then biotinylated by gently shaking the cells for 20 min with 3 ml of borate buffer containing 1.5 mg of NHS-SS-biotin (biotinylation solution). An additional 3 ml of the same biotinylation solution was then added, and the cells were rocked for an additional 20 min. The biotinylation solution was then discarded, and the cells were washed extensively with the quenching buffer (20 mm Tris and 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to scavenge the unreacted biotin, and then the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then scraped and solubilized with 500 μl of IPT buffer and were then sonicated for 20 s and agitated on a rotating rocker at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble cellular debris. The supernatant was then incubated with avidin-agarose to separate the biotinylated proteins from nonbiotinylated proteins by binding the former to avidin-agarose. Separation and analysis of the surface form from the intracellular form of NHE3V was performed as detailed in the figure legends. Regulation of NHE3V by Serum, PMA, and FGF—We have previously shown that FBS and FGF stimulate, whereas PMA inhibits, NHE3 (6Levine S.A. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol.

Tse C.M. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25527-25535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that the VSVG epitope on NHE3V does not interfere with growth factor regulation of NHE3V, we studied the effect of FBS, FGF, and PMA on NHE3V stably expressed in PS120 cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, when PS120/NHE3V cells, which were exposed to sodium medium (containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaPO4, 25 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and had come to a steady-state pH i, were then exposed to 10% FBS, an increase in pH i of 0.1 unit occurred. This intracellular alkalinization induced by serum could be blocked by 1 mmamiloride, confirming the activation of Na+/H+exchange (data not shown). Similarly, like wild-type NHE3, initial rate analysis revealed that FGF (10 ng/ml) stimulated NHE3V by aV max change (from 1671 ± 211 μm/s to 2205 ± 171 μm/s, a 32% increase) (Fig. 1 B), and PMA inhibited theV max of Na+/H+ exchange by NHE3V (decreased from 1796 ± 150 μm/s to 1086 ± 88 μm/s, a 40% decrease). In both cases, there is no change inK′(H i +) or the Hill coefficient. Similarly, 10% FBS stimulated the initial rate of Na+/H+ exchange by NHE3V by 45% (data not shown). These results show that NHE3V is regulated by protein kinases/growth factors similarly to wild-type NHE3. Since NHE3V is regulated by serum, PMA, and FGF in the same way these growth factors/protein kinases regulate NHE3 and the anti-VSVG antibody allowed quantitative immunoprecipitation of NHE3V, we determined whether NHE3V is a phosphoprotein under basal conditions and whether serum, FGF, and PMA change the amount of its phosphorylation. PS120/NHE3V cells were labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate, and NHE3V was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-VSVG antibody. The immunoprecipitated NHE3V was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2 A, under basal conditions, the rabbit polyclonal anti-VSVG antibody immunoprecipitated a single phosphoprotein of 85 kDa, which was recognized by the mouse monoclonal anti-VSVG antibody by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B). This is the same size of the protein recognized on Western analysis by anti-NHE3 antibody (5Hoogerwerf W.A. Tsao S.C. Devuyst O. Levine S.A. Yun C.H.C. Yip J.W. Cohen M.E. Wilson P.D. Lazenby A.J. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G29-G41PubMed Google Scholar). There was no detectable phosphoprotein immunoprecipitated by anti-VSVG antibody from untransfected PS120 cells (Fig. 2 A). These results indicate that anti-VSVG antibodies specifically immunoprecipitate NHE3V, and NHE3V is an 85-kDa phosphoprotein under basal conditions. In contrast to our original expectation, as shown in Fig.2 A, there was no change in the degree of total phosphorylation of NHE3V in response to a 5-min exposure to dialyzed FBS (10%), PMA (1 μm), or FGF (10 ng/ml). These findings were obtained in a series of five experiments, in which these regulators caused no consistent change in the amount of phosphorylation of NHE3. For instance, while serum apparently caused a small increase in phosphorylation of NHE3 in Fig. 2 A, in other studies such as in Fig. 2 B, this did not occur. Also, direct Cerenkov counting of the lyophilized immunoprecipitated digests gave similar counts of radioactivity among the control and samples treated with FBS, FGF, and PMA (data not shown). To eliminate the possibility that any potential differences in phosphorylation could have been masked by unequal amounts of NHE3V being immunoprecipitated under various conditions, an aliquot of the immunoprecipitated NHE3V was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Then, sequentially on the same blots, autoradiography followed by Western analysis was performed to analyze the amount of NHE3V phosphorylation and protein, respectively, in the same specimen (Fig. 2 B). It was shown that the amount of NHE3V phosphorylation per amount of NHE3V protein was constant under basal, FBS-, FGF-, and PMA-regulated conditions. Thus, stimulation of NHE3 transport activity by FBS and FGF and its inhibition by PMA are not associated with detectable changes in total phosphorylation of the exchanger protein. While there is no change in the"

https://openalex.org/W2055137884,"In this study, we have localized an enhancer element in the 5′-flanking region of the HGF gene promoter and have identified its functional transcriptional factors. Through transient transfection of NIH3T3 fibroblast cells and gel mobility shift assays, the functional binding site was localized to a short region (−318 to −303 bp from the transcription start site) which has a CTCCC sequence. This motif is also conserved in the human HGF promoter and acts as a binding site for the Sp family of transcription factors. In the presence of NIH3T3 nuclear protein extracts, this enhancer region formed specific DNA-protein complexes which were totally abrogated by excess amounts of consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide. In gel mobility supershift assays, anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies specifically recognized these complexes as was evident by their slower migration. Site-specific mutation of this binding motif resulted in total loss of Sp1 and Sp3 binding and a concomitant loss of enhancer function within the context of the HGF promoter. Furthermore, in transient cotransfection assays, overexpression of Sp1 and/or Sp3 stimulated HGF promoter activity independently and additively through binding to the Sp1 binding site in the HGF gene promoter region. DNaseI hypersensitive analysis of freshly isolated nuclei from NIH3T3 cells revealed that five hypersensitive sites (HSS) are present within the 2 kb region immediately upstream of the HGF promoter. One of these sites was mapped to position −0.3 kb from the transcription start site. These data show that both Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors upregulate HGF promoter activity by binding to the Sp1 binding site at position −318 to −303 bp in the HGF gene promoter."

https://openalex.org/W2143168721,"Leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase which belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily and is mainly expressed in pre-B lymphocytes and neuronal tissues. Recently, we demonstrated that LTK utilizes Shc and IRS-1 as two major substrates and while both equally activate the Ras pathway, only IRS-1 suppresses apoptosis of hematopoietic cells, suggesting the existence of another unidentified signaling pathway downstream of IRS-1, which is relevant to the anti-apoptotic activity. In the present study, we found that wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3' (PI3)-kinase, abolished the survival effects of LTK. Although c-Cbl is found to be phosphorylated by LTK and therefore is a second candidate linking LTK with the PI3-kinase pathway along with IRS-1, we found that the p85 subunit of PI3 kinase directly binds to tyrosine 753 of LTK, which is located within a YXXM motif, a consensus binding amino acid sequence for the SH2 domain of p85, but fails to bind to IRS-1 or c-Cbl. Ba/F3 cells which stably express the EGF receptor-LTK chimeric receptor carrying a mutation at tyrosine 753 fell into apoptotic death even in the presence of EGF, indicating that the PI3 kinase pathway is required for the survival effects of LTK."

Recently, Van Veldhoven et al. reported on the successful purification (13Van Veldhoven P.P. Van Rompuy P. Vanhooren J.C.T. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem.

We have noted that a THCA-CoA oxidase from rabbit liver was more stable than its rat counterpart, and this source also provided more material. In the present work we report on the partial purification of THCA-CoA oxidase from rabbit liver, cloning and sequencing of a cDNA coding for the enzyme, and expression of enzyme activity in COS cells after transfection with this cDNA. 3α,7α,12α-Trihydroxy-5β-[7-3H]cholestan-27-oic acid as well as 3α,7α,-dihydroxy-5β-cholestan-27-oic acid were prepared as described (16Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3889-3893Google Scholar) using bile from Alligator mississipiensis as starting material. The natural form of THCA in bile of A. mississipiensis has been identified as the 25R-diastereoisomer (17Batta A.K. Salen G. Cheng F.W. Shefer S. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 935-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the strong alkaline hydrolysis generally used during isolation causes isomerization at C-25 and the appearance of the 25S-isomer (18Batta A.K. Salen G. Cheng F.W. Shefer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11907-11909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated material was separated by HPLC on a 5-μm C-18 Nucleosil column (0.5 × 25 cm) with 24% 30 mm trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2.9 with triethylamine) in methanol as eluting solvent. The 25R- and the 25S-isomers of THCA were almost completely separated in this system (19Pedersen J.I. Veggan T. Björkhem I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The ratio between the 25R and the 25S isomers in the material primarily isolated was about 7:3. The combined fractions of tritium-labeled (25R)- and (25S)-THCA as well as unlabeled DHCA were converted into CoA esters using the same method as used for the synthesis of choloyl-CoA (20Webster L.T. Killenberg P.G. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 77: 430-436Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Purified palmitoyl-CoA oxidase was a gift from Prof. T. Hashimoto (Shinshu University, Matsumoto, Japan). 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate was from Eastman Kodak Co. (Rochester, NY). The sources of special reagents and kits are given below. Other chemicals were commercial high purity material. Liver peroxisomes were prepared from a male rabbit fasted for 24 h essentially as described for rat liver (21Prydz K. Kase B.F. Björkhem I.

The light mitochondrial fraction generated by centrifugation of the postmitochondrial supernatant at 16,200 rpm (24,000 ×g av) for 10 min in the Kontron T324 centrifuge (A8.24 rotor) was layered on a linear Nycodenz gradient ranging from 15% (w/v) in 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm Hepes at pH 7.4 to 45% in 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Hepes at pH 7.4. The gradient tubes contained a prelayered 2-ml Maxidenz cushion and were centrifuged at 30.000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in the Sorvall TV 850 vertical rotor. Fractions of 1.7 ml were collected and assayed for catalase activity (22Baudhuin P. Beaufay H. Rahman-Li H. Sellinger O.Z. Wattiaux R. Jacques P. deDuve C. Biochem.

The five fractions with the highest activity were combined, diluted with 0.25 m sucrose, and centrifuged at 33,000 rpm (100,000 × g) for 45 min. The pellet (14 mg of protein from two gradients) was resuspended in 10 ml of solubilization buffer consisting of 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 9, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μm FAD, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. After stirring on ice for 1 h and centrifugation at 33,000 rpm for 45 min, the supernatant was brought to pH 7.4 and applied to a hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP, Bio-Rad) column (volume, 5 ml; diameter, 1 cm). The column was equilibrated in 10 mmphosphate buffer pH 7.4, 10 μm FAD, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% ethylene glycol and eluted with the same buffer to remove unbound protein. The flow rate was 0.35 ml/min, and 1.75-ml fractions were collected. Protein containing THCA-CoA oxidase (and devoid of palmitoyl-CoA oxidase activity) was eluted with 60 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10 μmFAD, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% ethylene glycol. The active fractions (total volume, 9.5 ml) were concentrated to 2.2 ml in a dialysis bag (Spectra-Por 2 membrane) covered with polyethylene glycol (molecular weight, 15,000–20,000; Sigma). Aliquots (0.45 ml) of the concentrated protein solution were subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex™ 200 HR 10/30 column connected to a Smart™ chromatography system (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Elution was performed with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm KPi buffer, pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and 20% ethylene glycol at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, and fractions of 0.25 ml were collected. Protein in the peak fractions from the gel filtration above was concentrated by precipitation (24Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3105) Google Scholar), and the dried sample was dissolved in 25 μl of sample buffer containing 8 mm dithiothreitol. After heating to 95 °C for 4 min, the reduced sample was alkylated by incubation at room temperature for 20 min with 16 mm iodoacetamide. The sample was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205463) Google Scholar) on a 10% gel of 1-mm thickness using the Mini-Protean II Slab Cell (Bio-Rad). After Coomassie Blue staining, the band corresponding to a molecular mass of 72 kDa, using the 72-kDa band of the palmitoyl-CoA oxidase as a reference (26Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Ui N. J. Biochem. 1980; 87: 1735-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), was excised, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and subjected to in-gel digestion essentially according to Hellman et al. (27Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Góñez J. Heldin C.-H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In brief, the gel pieces were washed with 0.5 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.2, and 50% acetonitrile and then completely dried. To introduce the protease into the gel piece, 10 μl of 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.2, containing 0.5 μg of endo-LysC (protease source Achromobacter lyticus, WAKO Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany) was added. Rehydration was continued by adding 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.2, in small aliquots until the gel piece was immersed. After overnight incubation at 30 °C, the supernatant was saved and combined with extractions from the gel piece. Generated peptides were isolated by reversed phase liquid chromatography on a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column in a SMARTTM chromatography system. Peptides were sequenced on a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems model 494 instrument, following the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a 380B DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, CA), using the β-cyanoethylphosphoamidite chemistry. A cDNA library made from New Zealand White rabbit liver in the phage λgt10 was obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The library (5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library) was constructed with oligo(dT) and random priming utilizing EcoRI linkers and was found to contain 2.5 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml. The library was propagated in Escherichia coli C600 Hfl according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Screening of the library was performed with oligonucleotide probes, end-labeled with 32P. Positive clones were isolated, and the λ DNA was purified with the WizardTM Lambda Preps DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI).The inserts were excised from the vector by digestion withEcoRI, extracted from the agarose gel (GenEluteTM agarose spin columns, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), and subcloned into pUC18 using the Ready-To-GoTM DNA Ligase (Pharmacia). Plasmid DNA was purified with the Jetstar Mini Plasmid Purification system (Genomed, Research Triangle Park, NC). Sequencing of inserts were done automatically on a 373 DNA sequencer stretch (Applied Biosystems), using the ABI PRISMTM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit with AmpliTaqR polymerase FS (Perkin-Elmer). Stock cultures of the cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection was carried out by electroporation in 0.4-cm cuvettes (Gene Pulser II without the pulse controller unit; Bio-Rad), using a single pulse of 0.40 kV and 25 microfarads. After transfection, the cells were grown for 48 h, harvested by low speed centrifugation, and homogenized (sonication for 6–10 s) in the incubation medium. The conversion of THCA-CoA into 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholest-24(E)-enoic acid (Δ24-THCA) was measured at 30 °C in a volume of 0.1 ml in an incubation medium that contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 75 μm FAD, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 42 μm (25R)- and (25S)-[3H]THCA-CoA (60.000 cpm). The incubations were stopped with 2.5 μl of 6 m KOH and hydrolyzed at 60 °C for 30 min to remove bound CoA. After acidification with HCl and extraction with ethyl acetate, the samples were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC on a 5-μm YMC-Pack ODS-A column (250 × 4.6-mm inner diameter) (YMC Co., Ltd. Kyoto, Japan). The eluting solvent was 20% 30 mm trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2.9 with triethylamine) in methanol. Radioactivity in the eluent was monitored by a Flo-One Beta radiochromatography detector (Radiomatic Instruments & Chemical Co., Inc. Tampa, FL). THCA-CoA racemase activity was assayed in the same incubation buffer by following the conversion of (25R)-THCA-CoA into (25S)-THCA after hydrolysis and extraction as above. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211739) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein in the eluent from the gel filtration column was estimated based on the UV absorbance in the eluent compared with that of a fixed amount of injected bovine serum albumin. Extracts of incubations were dried under N2, and the material was methylated by treatment with methanol, 2,2-dimethoxypropane, concentrated HCl (1:0.7:0.011, v/v/v) for 30 min at 55 °C. The mixture was dried under N2 and sialylated by treatment with 300 μl of pyridine, hexamethyldisilazane, trimethylchlorosilane (3:2:1, v/v/v) for 30 min at 60 °C. The solvent was removed by N2, and the material was dissolved in isooctane. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the isooctane solution was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5890 series II Plusgas chromatograph equipped with an HP-ultra capillary column (25 m × 0.30 mm, 0.33-μm thickness), connected to an HP 5972 mass selective detector and an HP 7673A automatic sample injector. The oven temperature program was as follows: 180 °C for 1 min, 35 °C/min to 270 °C, and then 20 °C/min to 300 °C, where the temperature was kept for 19 min. Helium was used as carrier gas. The gas chromatograph was operated in the constant flow mode, with the flow rate set to 0.8 ml/min. The injector was operated in the splitless mode and kept at 270 °C, and the detector transfer line was kept at 280 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in the selected ion monitoring mode, and two ions were detected simultaneously. The ions used for analysis were as follows: 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic-acid and 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholest-24-enoic acid,m/z 412 and m/z 410; 3α,7α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic acid and 3α,7α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-cholest-24-enoic-acid,m/z 500 and m/z 498. The retention times were as follows: 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic acid, 17.54 min; 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholest-24-enoic acid, 20.47 min; 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic acid, 17.82 min; 3α7α12α-dihydroxy-5β-cholest-24-enoic acid, 20.83 min. During our attempts to purify the enzyme, we experienced, as did others (13Van Veldhoven P.P. Van Rompuy P. Vanhooren J.C.T. Mannaerts G.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), considerable problems with the stability of the enzyme. During the different purification steps, we noticed, however, that activity was always associated with a band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of about 72 kDa and a migration distance identical to that of the 72-kDa fragment of purified palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (26Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Ui N. J. Biochem. 1980; 87: 1735-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Even if it was possible after several purification steps to obtain a preparation that showed only this band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the total amount of protein was too small for further characterization (29Östlund Farrants, A.-K. (1992) Peroxisomal Oxidation in Bile Acid Formation: Some Mechanistic and Regulatory Aspects, Ph.D. thesis, University of Oslo.Google Scholar). We therefore decided to reduce the number of purification steps and base our cloning strategy on in-gel digestion and peptide analysis of this protein band. The steps used are shown in TableI. Solubilization of the peroxisomes in hypotonic pyrophosphate buffer in the presence of detergent on ice was found to be efficient. Heat treatment was avoided, since it was found that, unlike palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (26Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Ui N. J. Biochem. 1980; 87: 1735-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), THCA-CoA oxidase was very heat-labile. The acyl-CoA oxidase activity and the THCA-CoA activity were separated on a hydroxylapatite column. THCA-CoA oxidase eluted at 60 mm phosphate buffer, while acyl-CoA oxidase was eluted at 200 mm phosphate buffer. No acyl-CoA oxidase was detected in the 60 mm fraction eluate, while a small amount of THCA-CoA oxidase eluted in the 200 mm fraction. The 60 mm fraction eluate was concentrated by dialysis against polyethylene glycol and further fractionated by gel filtration (Fig.1). Maximum THCA-CoA oxidase activity was detected in fraction 14 that eluted between 13.00 and 13.25 ml, which was immediately in front of the elution volume corresponding to bovine serum albumin (13.5 ml), suggesting a molecular mass of the oxidase of about 70 kDa. Fractions between 12.75 and 13.50 ml were used as a source of the oxidase. Activity measurement in the active fractions was complicated by the presence of a THCA-CoA racemase activity (interconversion of (25R)- and (25S)-THCA-CoA) (19Pedersen J.I. Veggan T. Björkhem I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that started to elute immediately after the peak fraction of THCA-CoA oxidase activity. Maximum THCA-CoA racemase was found to be in a fraction between 14.75 and 15.00 ml, corresponding to a molecular mass of about 40 kDa. This compares with the values given by Schmitzet al. of 45 kDa for a similar rat liver mitochondrial enzyme (30Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 223-313Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and 47 kDa for a human liver peroxisomal enzyme (31Schmitz W. Albers C. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fractions between 14.5 and 15.5 ml (fractions 20–23) were pooled and used as a source of racemase in incubations when required (see legend to Fig. 1). The racemase preparation was found to be contaminated with some THCA-CoA oxidase activity, corresponding to about 10% of that in the peak fraction of the oxidase. The substrate used for the THCA-CoA oxidase assay contained the 25R- and 25S-isomers in a ratio of 7:3, and since the S-isomer appears to be the physiological one (19Pedersen J.I. Veggan T. Björkhem I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the amount of this substrate was not at saturation level. The presence of the racemase activity therefore resulted in an erroneously high activity in some of the fractions on the low molecular side of the eluate. For this reason a fixed amount of racemase was included in all incubations of fractions from the gel filtration step to be assayed for the oxidase activity.Table IPurification of THCA-CoA oxidase from rabbit liver peroxisomesPurification stepVolumeProteinActivitySpecific activityActivity yieldmlmgnmol/minnmol/mg × min%Peroxisomes1.414.117212.2100Soluble preparation1011.090.38.252.5Hydroxylapatite column9.51.3348.336.328.1Gel filtration, peak fraction1.250.073.1745.31.8Starting from 66 g of rabbit liver, the light mitochondrial fraction was separated on two Nycodenz gradients as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The five fractions containing the highest catalase activity were used as starting material. Open table in a new tab Starting from 66 g of rabbit liver, the light mitochondrial fraction was separated on two Nycodenz gradients as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The five fractions containing the highest catalase activity were used as starting material. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the active fractions from the gel filtration showed the appearance of a band at aout 72 kDa that varied in intensity corresponding to the activity (Fig. 2). The migration of this band was identical to that of the 72-kDa band of palmitoyl-CoA oxidase. In-gel digestion of the protein contained in this band and separation by HPLC generated a large number of peptides (Fig. 3), five of which were sequenced and found to contain 6–17 amino acids (not including the initial lysine required by the protease endo-LysC for cleavage). The sequence of peptide 3 was used to design two oligonucleotides intended for screening for the THCA-CoA oxidase cDNA (Fig. 4). In accordance with the cleavage pattern of the enzyme endo-LysC, it was assumed that a lysine residue would precede the amino-terminal aspartic residue of the peptide. Two oligonucleotides were synthesized, denoted Ox-1 and Ox-2, which differed only in the codon for serine, where different triplets were utilized (Fig. 4). The most prevailing codons for the amino acids found in the rabbit genome were used (32Wada, K., Wada, Y., Doi, H., Ishibashi, F., Gojobori, T., and Ikemura, T. (1991) Nucleic Acids Res. , 19, (suppl.) 1981–1986.Google Scholar), and in two positions with a high degree of degeneracy inosine was inserted (Fig. 4).Figure 3HPLC chromatogram of peptides obtained after in-gel digestion of protein contained in the 72-kDa band (Fig. 2).

In this way, several cDNA-clones were isolated. One of these, denoted λ10, numbered 2092 bp and contained an open reading frame of 2046 bp (Fig.5). Another shorter clone (λ69) overlapped with λ10 in the 5′-end with 47 bp, making the total cDNA sequence obtained 2139 bp. Since the cDNA sequence contained an EcoRI site (in position 1173 of the complete sequence), the insert of λ10 was cleaved in two fragments, which were subcloned separately in plasmid vectors. The sequence around the EcoRI site was verified by sequence analysis of a polymerase chain reaction fragment from the λ phage clone, spanning this region. All of the five peptides could be localized within the sequence (Fig. 6). The shortest of the peptides (peptide 2) represented the C-terminal end of the polypeptide chain. However, this peptide partly overlapped with another of the peptides (peptide 4), and therefore the enzyme cleavage must have occurred after a glutamine and not, as expected, after a lysine residue. Whether this indicates the presence of microheterogeneity in this position or possibly some protease contaminant in the endo-LysC preparation is presently not known.Figure 6Rabbit THCA-CoA oxidase cDNA and the sequence of the encoded polypeptide.

The obtained peptide sequence showed a homology with rat THCA-CoA oxidase of 73.6% and a homology with rat acyl-CoA oxidase of 41.8% (Fig. 7). Interestingly, there are two additional methionine residues in the amino-terminal part of the deduced sequence (in positions 18 and 22). The most proximal of these corresponds to the initiation methionine residue of rat acyl-CoA oxidase, the sequence of which is 17 amino acid residues shorter in the amino-terminal end than the other"

Two regulatory elements, the cardiac specific sequence (CSS) located upstream (−360 base pairs) and a downstream negative modulatory sequence (NMS), which function in concert with each other, are required for repression of the MLC2 promoter activity in skeletal muscle. Individually, CSS and NMS have no effect. Transient transfection analysis with recombinant plasmids indicated that CSS- and NMS-mediated repression of transcription is position- and orientation-dependent and is transferable to heterologous promoters. A minimal conserved motif, GAAG/CTTC, present in both CSS and NMS, is responsible for repression as the mutation in the core CTTC sequence alone was sufficient to abrogate its repressor activity. The DNA binding assay by gel mobility shift analysis revealed that one of the two complexes, CSSBP2, is significantly enriched in embryonic skeletal muscle relative to cardiac muscle. In extracts from adult skeletal muscle, where the cardiac MLC2 expression is suppressed, both complexes, CSSBP1 and CSSBP2, were present, whereas the cardiac muscle extracts contained CSSBP1 alone, suggesting that the protein(s) in the CSSBP2 complex accounts for the negative regulation of cardiac MLC2 in skeletal muscle. A partial cDNA clone (Nished) specific for the candidate repressor factor was isolated by expression screening of the skeletal muscle cDNA library by multimerized CSS-DNA as probe.

Full-Text PDF Open Access The acquisition of the differentiated phenotype of eukaryotic cells is a consequence of activation of tissue-specific genes and repression of other genes, both of which are precisely controlled during development of multicellular organisms (1Tijan R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Since only a small population of genes is expressed at any given time in the differentiated cell, it is becoming increasingly clear that the mechanisms by which genes are repressed are as important as those that activate them (2Mitchell A.P.

Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and a negative regulatory region, cardiac specific sequence (CSS), responsible for repression of cardiac MLC2 transcription in skeletal muscle (21Shen R. Goswami S.K. Mascareno E. Kumar A. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1676-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of CSS alone restores cardiac MLC2 expression in skeletal muscle without impairing its function in cardiac muscle cells (21Shen R. Goswami S.K. Mascareno E. Kumar A. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1676-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An upstream negative regulatory domain distinct from CSS also exists in the rat MLC2 gene promoter, mutation of which led to ectopic expression of the gene in transgenic animals (27Lee K.J. Hickey R. Zhu H. Chein K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1220-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have delineated the regulatory domains within CSS essential for repression of the cardiac MLC2 promoter in skeletal muscle. There are three distinct protein binding sites, CSS-A, CSS-B, and CSS-C, each of which contains a common sequence motif, GAAG/CTTC. Mutation in the CTTC motif in CSS-B alone was sufficient to abrogate totally both DNA-protein interaction and the inhibitory function of CSS. CSS-mediated repression, however, requires the presence of another downstream sequence element, the negative modulatory sequence (NMS), which also contains the conserved GAAG motif and serves as the binding site for nuclear proteins. Neither of the two motifs alone can repress transcription. The CSS/NMS-binding protein complex, CSSBP2, is present at a significantly higher level in nuclear extracts from skeletal muscle relative to cardiac muscle, suggesting that CSSBP2 binding to CSS/NMS accounts for repression of the MLC2 promoter function in skeletal muscle. In an attempt to identify the protein(s) involved in the repression mechanism, we have isolated a partial cDNA clone (Nished; Sanskrit for “negative”) by expression screening of the cDNA library derived from chicken skeletal muscle mRNA by multimerized CSS-DNA as a probe. The predicted amino acid sequence of Nished shows a significant similarity to two previously described repressors, runt from Drosophila (28Kania M.A. Bonner A.S. Duffy J.B. Gergen J.P. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1701-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and SP3 from human (29De Luca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To construct CSS-containing muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter/reporter recombinant, the proximal MLC2 promoter (−160 to +158) in pMLC410CAT was replaced by the 246-bpHindIII fragment containing the MCK basal promoter from plasmid E4 (30Sternberg E.A.

MCK enhancer contained within a 300-bpBamHI restriction fragment was then introduced into the unique BamHI site to generate MCKCSS. Likewise, the proximal MLC2 promoter (−160 to +158) of pMLC410CAT was replaced by the 2,500-bp MCK promoter/enhancer fragment (30Sternberg E.A. Spizz G. Perry W. Vizard M.D. Weil T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2896-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) to construct MCK2.5CSS. The HindIII-PstI restriction fragment from pMLC371CAT that contains the CSS domain was cloned upstream to the pANG700 promoter (31Ohkubo H.R. Kageyama M. Ujihara T. Hirose S. Nakanishi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80 (2nd Ed.): 2196-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and designated as pANG700CSS. To construct pANGCSS, the HindIII-PstI fragment from pMLC371CAT was cloned into the plasmid pBasic CAT (Promega) in theHindIII and PstI sites in the polylinker. The 264-bp NciI-XbaI fragment of ANG proximal promoter was then cloned downstream to CSS in the polylinker atSalI-XbaI to produce pANGCSS. The PstI fragment (−130 bp to +40 bp) from the MLC2 promoter was cloned into the PstI site in pBasic CAT to construct PST. A 160-bpHindIII-PstI fragment containing the CSS domain was spliced in the corresponding sites in the polylinker of pBasic CAT; the resultant plasmid was then linearized with PstI and ligated to the PstI fragment (−160 to +158) containing the MLC2 promoter to create plasmid CSSPST. A synthetic oligonucleotide harboring the NMS sequence (GAAG) flanked by XbaI was inserted downstream of the MLC promoter in plasmid PST to create CSSPSTNMSCAT. MLC2 proximal promoter (−125 to + 158 bp) obtained as anHindIII fragment was cloned into the HindIII site in the polylinker of the basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) to create MLCLUC. An oligonucleotide with HindIII ends, spanning the 50-bp CSS element (5′-agcttccattgtgaaggacgagggggtacttctaccctgaagcaaaagga-3′) was cloned into the HindIII site of polylinker of pBluescript-SK+. Plasmid with the CSS domain in forward and reversed orientations was digested with restriction enzymes SacI and XhoI, and the restriction fragments were cloned in the corresponding sites in the polylinker in MLCLUC. The resultant plasmids were designated MLCCSSLUC and MLC3′CSSLUC, respectively. An oligonucleotide containing the CSS sequence with nucleotides altered to introduce specific mutations and flanked by HindIII and XhoI sites was synthesized. The resultant oligonucleotides were ligated toSmaI and XhoI sites in the polylinker in MLCLUC to ensure directed ligation. The resultant plasmid was designated MLCΔBCSS. Skeletal muscle tissue was collected from the leg (soleus) muscle of 13-day-old chicken embryo, digested with 0.1% pancreatin, and cells were suspended in complete medium (60% Waymouth, 40% Hanks' balanced salt solution medium with 15% horse serum, 2% chicken serum) and filtered through sieves of 90 μm and 45 μm sequentially. Preplating was done three times, for 1 h each, to facilitate differential removal of fibroblasts. Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish. Cultures were re-fed with fresh medium before transfection. Transfections were done using calcium phosphate precipitation (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). CAT enzyme activity in the extracts was assayed as described previously (20Qasba P.

Cells were lysed in 1 × lysis buffer (Promega), and the luciferase activity was assessed according to instructions provided by Promega in a monolight luminometer. For normalization in the uptake of luciferase reporter plasmids, β-galactosidase activity under the pCMV promoter was used as an internal control. Tissues from embryonic and adult heart and skeletal muscles were minced finely, and the dissociated cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin (10 μg/ml) with a Wheaton dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were collected, and protein extracts were prepared as described previously (23Zhou M.D. Goswami S. Martin M.E. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Mol. Cell.

Double-stranded oligonucleotide was end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and 0.5 ng of labeled oligonucleotide, incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI·dC), 1–12 μg of protein in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 3% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmEDTA, and 50 mm KCl at 4 °C for 30 min. Competitor DNA was added in a 100-fold excess following incubation for 30 min on ice, and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis as described previously (23Zhou M.D. Goswami S. Martin M.E. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1222-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A footprinting assay was performed using nuclear extract from embryonic and adult skeletal muscle essentially as described earlier (24Zhou M.D. Wu Y. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 127-138PubMed Google Scholar). A 160-bpEcoRI-XhoI fragment containing the CSS domain was incubated with nuclear extract (10–60 μg of protein) from embryonic and adult cardiac and skeletal muscle in a 50-μl reaction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9) 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Following incubation at room temperature freshly diluted DNase-I (1 μg/ml) was added and then allowed to incubate for 60 s. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and analyzed on an 8% sequencing gel. For footprinting of the NMS domain, a PstI-HindIII fragment spanning the NMS region was labeled by end filling. Chicken skeletal muscle cDNA expression library cloned in the λZap expression vector obtained from Stratagene was screened according to Singh et al. (34Singh H. Lebowitz J.H. Baldwin A.S. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) using the multimer (4 ×) of CSS-50. For expression of the recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, expression vector pET29B (Novagen) was digested withBamHI and XhoI ligated with cDNA insert obtained as a BamHI-XhoI insert from phagemid Bluescript and transformed into host cells BL(21)DE3. Induction was done according to manufacturer's (Novagen) instructions. Poly(A)+ was made from cardiac and skeletal muscle of an adult chicken following the FastTrack mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 g of tissue was homogenized in 15 ml of lysis buffer containing RNase protein degrader and incubated at 450 °C for 60 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was recovered and 950 μl of 5m NaCl added. The DNA was sheared using a 18–21-gauge needle, and oligo(dT) cellulose pellet was added and incubated with gentle rocking for 60 min at room temperature. Then, the samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was carefully removed from the oligo(dT) bed. The beds were washed three times with 20 ml of binding buffer; the supernatant was removed after a spin of 3,000 × g for 5 min, followed by a wash in low salt buffer (three times). The poly(A)+was eluted in 200 μl of elution buffer and then precipitated with cold ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3 m NaOAc. 10 μg of poly(A)+ from cardiac and skeletal muscle was loaded in 1.3% agarose/formaldehyde in 1 × MOPS, as described previously (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 33Goswami S. Qasba P. Ghatpande S. Carleton S. Deshpande A.K. Baig M. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5130-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Previous studies in our laboratory (21Shen R. Goswami S.K. Mascareno E. Kumar A. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1676-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have identified a negative regulatory region, CSS, located between −371 and −282 bp in the chicken cardiac MLC2 gene promoter, which is required for repression of cardiac MLC2 gene transcription in skeletal muscle cells. To test the potential role of CSS in repressing the transcription of heterologous promoters such as skeletal MCK (30Sternberg E.A. Spizz G. Perry W. Vizard M.D. Weil T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2896-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and the non-muscle rat ANG (31Ohkubo H.R. Kageyama M. Ujihara T. Hirose S. Nakanishi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80 (2nd Ed.): 2196-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) promoters, we used plasmid pMCKCSS and pANGCSS containing CSS in the respective promoters in a transient transfection assay in skeletal muscle cells in culture. pMCKCSS expression was repressed effectively (80%) compared with that of parent plasmid pMCK without CSS (Fig. 1 A). When CSS was placed 2.5 kilobases upstream to the MCK promoter (see “Materials and Methods”), the activity of the resultant plasmid, MCK2.5CSS, was the same as the parent plasmid pMCK2.5, suggesting that repression of transcription by CSS is position-dependent (Fig.1 A). Similar results were obtained when we tested the rat ANG promoter, which is expressed optimally in liver and at a lower level in skeletal muscle. As shown in Fig. 1 B, pANGCSS activity was repressed significantly (52%) relative to the level of the ANG promoter lacking CSS (pANG). The expression of plasmid containing CSS placed 700 bp upstream in the ANG promoter (pANG700CSS) was not repressed. When CSS was fused to the reporter plasmid carrying the thymidine kinase promoter, no repression was obtained (Fig.1 C), suggesting that the repression mechanism might require other regulatory sequence(s) involved in the CSS-mediated inhibition of transcription (see below). To identify the nucleotide sequence within CSS involved in protein-DNA interaction, a DNase-I footprinting assay was performed using a 160-bp fragment that contains the CSS domain (−410 to −250) and nuclear extracts from adult and embryonic (13-day-old) chicken skeletal (soleus) muscle (Fig.2). Three protected regions (CSS-A: 5′-CCATTGTGAAGGAC-3′; CSS-B: 5′-GATACTTC-3′; and CSS-C: 5′-CTGAAGCAAAGG-3′), which together span between −360 and −310, and at least one hypersensitive site were detected. A common nucleotide sequence motif, GAAG, is present in regions A and C and the complementary sequence, CTTC, in region B. We have denoted this region (−360 to −310) as CSS-50. The sequence GAAG/CTTC was also identified as a regulatory motif in the negative regulatory domains of several other genes (27Lee K.J. Hickey R. Zhu H. Chein K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1220-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chow K.L. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 528-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Clark A.R. Docherty K. Biochem.

Virology. 1991; 180: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that the motif plays a conserved role in negative regulation of transcription. To define further the role of CSS-50, GMSAs were done with nuclear extracts from embryonic heart and skeletal muscles (Fig.3 A). Two well defined complexes, CSSBP1 and CSSBP2, were formed with extracts from both embryonic tissues. The intensity of the fast migrating complex, CSSBP2, was markedly higher in skeletal muscle compared with the corresponding complex in cardiac muscle. Both complexes were competed out by CSS and by an oligonucleotide IRE (intron-responsive) containing an activator element in the first intron of the MLC2 gene, which also contains the GAAG/CTTC motif. When nuclear extracts from the adult (4 weeks old) skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues were compared as above, only CSSBP1 binding activity was present in the cardiac muscle, whereas the skeletal muscle extract contained both CSSBP1 and CSSBP2 complexes (Fig.3 A). Since cardiac MLC2 is down-regulated in skeletal tissue, one may speculate that the relative abundance of CSSBP2 accounts for negative regulation of MLC2 gene in skeletal muscle. A barely visible complex was observed when CTTC in CSS-B was mutated to GGTC (CSSΔB) (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the binding activity of CSS-50 is primarily due to the CSS-B sequence. To investigate whether the sequence contained in CSS-50 alone is sufficient for repression or whether it acts in concert with other elements, we used the minimal basal MLC2 promoter contained in the −121 to +158 fragment containing the three cis-regulatory elements, CArG box, myocyte enhancer factor 2 site, and TATA box, which are required for its optimal expression in cardiac muscle cells (21Shen R. Goswami S.K. Mascareno E. Kumar A. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1676-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Zhou M.D. Goswami S. Martin M.E. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1222-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the presence of the CSS-50 alone produced an effective (70%) inhibition of MLC2 transcription, as measured by the luciferase assay. Recombinant plasmid MLCCSS3′LUC, with CSS-50 in reverse orientation, was totally ineffective, suggesting that CSS is not a conventional silencer, as it is both position- and orientation-dependent. Since it was reported that the regulatory sequences of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (44Arnold H. Lohse H. Seidel P.U. Bober E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), SP1 (45Saidapet C. Khandekar P. Mendola C. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and E box (25Minty A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) have an additive effect on transcription when present in multiple copies, we made recombinants with four copies of CSS, arranged in tandem, placed upstream in plasmid pMLCLUC. However, the presence of multiple copies of CSS in plasmid pMLC4XCSSLUC did not cause additional repression of transcription compared with repression observed with the single CSS copy in pMLCCSSLUC. When a substitution mutation (CTTC → GGTC) was introduced in window B in plasmid pMLCΔBCSSLUC, the repression due to CSS was disrupted, and the expression level of the mutant plasmid reached 80% of the activity of the parent plasmid pMLCLUC. Additional mutations in the reverse complement GAAG sequence in window C exhibit no further loss of repression (data not shown). Since mutation in CSS-B window alone caused a loss of protein binding in CSS-50, it would appear that the conserved sequence CTTC in CSS-B is the primary target for binding the repressor protein(s), which also accounts for its loss of function upon mutation. The plasmid pMLCLUC, used in the experiments above, contains the downstream sequence up to +158. An examination of the downstream sequence revealed that the conserved GAAG/CTTC motif is also present once in the 5′-untranslated region at +60 in the MLC2 gene. To test the potential involvement of this motif in repression, we constructed the plasmids PST and CSSPST, containing the basal promoter alone extending to +42, without and with CSS, respectively (see “Materials and Methods”) (Fig. 5). Plasmid CSSPST, which lacks the downstream sequence containing the GAAG motif but has the upstream CSS element, was surprisingly as active as PST, which lacks both the upstream and downstream elements. This would mean that CSS alone was unable to repress MLC2 transcription in skeletal muscle cells and suggests the requirement of the downstream GAAG motif, which was absent in both constructs. To test this possibility, we inserted the GAAG contained in a short (17-mer) oligonucleotide (5′-tctagacctagaagacttctaga-3′) downstream of the MLC2 promoter in CSSPST (see “Materials and Methods”). The resultant plasmid CSSPSTNMS was act"
https://openalex.org/W2319603847,"We have studied the concerted action of factors that influence the balance between cell proliferation and cell death in the developing lens of transgenic mice. We show that a human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV18) E6/E7 transgene that predominantly expresses the viral E7 gene product triggers apoptosis in a dose dependent manner, and causes retardation of lens growth or microphakia. E7 is known to inactivate pRB, the product of the retinoblastoma gene, and to enhance the action of p53. Our earlier work had demonstrated that over-expression of p53 itself can cause apoptosis of lens cells, and that a mutant p53 allele can interfere with this process. In the present study, we examined lenses that simultaneously express different constellations of the HPV18 E6/E7, wild-type and mutant human p53, and wild-type human pRB transgenes. We observed that lens cells expressing the HPV18 transgene are more sensitive to wild-type human p53 action than normal lens cells. As a result, there is severe microphakia in lenses that express both the HPV18 and the wild-type p53 transgenes. By contrast, apoptosis was reduced in lenses that co-expressed the HPV18 and either the pRB or the mutant p53 transgene. We conclude that levels of wild-type p53 are critical, and that any excess of p53 or suppression of pRB can cause cell death. Our results encourage attempts to counteract the deleterious action of human papillomaviruses in cervical cancer by a combination of measures that decrease cell proliferation and enhance apoptosis."

We have generated positively supercoiled plasmid DNA using reverse gyrase from Sulfolobus shibatae and subjected it to the Hin-mediated inversion reaction. Both Hin and Fis showed the same DNA binding activity regardless of the superhelical handedness of the substrate plasmid. However, inversion activity on positively supercoiled DNA was less than 1% of negatively supercoiled DNA. Assays designed to probe steps in inversion, showed that on positively supercoiled DNA, Hin was able to cleave the recombination sites with the same efficiency shown on negatively supercoiled DNA but was not able to exchange the cleaved DNA. Based on the theoretical differences between positive and negative supercoiling, our data may suggest that unwinding of the double helix at recombination sites is needed after DNA cleavage for strand exchange to occur.

The Hin recombinase from Salmonella typhimuriumcatalyzes a site-specific recombination that leads to inversion of the intervening DNA that is flanked by two recombination sites known ashix (1Johnson R.C. Bruist M.B. Glaccum M.B. Simon M.I. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 751-760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hin, a 21-kDa protein, exists as a homodimer in solution and binds to hix site that is composed of imperfect 13-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pairs; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; Lk, linking number. inverted repeats (2Johnson R.C.

Chem. 1989; 264: 10072-10082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For an efficient Hin-mediated inversion reaction, an additional protein factor, Fis is required (4Johnson R.C. Bruist M.F. Simon M.I. Cell. 1986; 46: 531-539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Fis, a 11-kDa protein, binds to two different sites in 64-bp DNA sequences called the recombination enhancer (see Fig. 1). A current mechanistic view of the Hin-mediated inversion reaction begins with the interaction between hix-bound Hin dimers, which results in bringing the two hix sites in close proximity to form a paired-hix structure (5Heichman K.A. Johnson R.C. Science. 1990; 249: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Lim H.M. Hughes K.T. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11183-11190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This nucleoprotein complex should be assembled with the Fis-bound enhancer into a higher order nucleoprotein complex (a synaptic complex named invertasome). In this synaptic complex, Hin is able to cleave the middle of hix sites to which it is bound, generating 2-bp recessed 5′-phosphate ends (5Heichman K.A. Johnson R.C. Science. 1990; 249: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Johnson R.C. Bruist M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Each of the four 5′-ends of the cleaved DNA strand is covalently but transiently linked to the serine residue at position 10 of each protomer of Hin (7Johnson R.C. Bruist M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Exchange of the cleaved DNA strands and religation now lead the intervening DNA to inverted configuration (8Heichman K.A. Moskowitz I.P.G. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). One of the interesting properties of the Hin-mediated inversion system has been that it requires negative (−)supercoiling of substrate DNA for an efficient inversion reaction (1Johnson R.C. Bruist M.B. Glaccum M.B. Simon M.I. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 751-760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of invertasome formation on a series of topoisomers (from fully relaxed to the physiological density) of a substrate plasmid showed that invertasome is not formed on fully relaxed plasmid (thus, no cleavage), and efficient invertasome formation requires high density of negative supercoiling (9Lim H.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11176-11182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These authors suggested that negative supercoiling is required to form invertasome by promoting or stabilizing the physical contact between Hin and Fis. Topological studies of recombinant DNA after inversion suggested that negative supercoiling may provide specific geometry (a branch point in negatively supercoiled plasmid) of recombination sites for the formation of invertasome (Fig. 1) (10Kanaar R. van de Putte P. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The dependence of (−)supercoiling of substrate plasmids has also been well established in many related site-specific recombination systems such as Gin invertase (11Mertens G. Hoffman A. Blocker H. Frank R. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2415-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Plasterk R.H.A. Kanaar R. van de Putte P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2689-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), γδ resolvase (13Reed R.R. Cell. 1981; 25: 713-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), Tn3 resolvase (14Krasnow M.A. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1983; 32: 1313-1324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and λ integrase (15Mizuuchi K. Gellert M. Nash H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 375-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Negative supercoiling has been suggested to provide common roles in different site-specific recombination systems (for review, see Ref.16Kanaar R. Cozzarelli N.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 369-379Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). First, it provides specific intertwining or geometry of double helix DNA for each recombinase to make proper synaptic complexes required to perform their specific roles, inversion (Hin and Gin; 5, 10), deletion (γδ and Tn3 resolvase; 17Benjamin H.W. Cozzarelli N.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and integration (λ integrase; 18Richet E. Abcarian P. Nash H.A. Cell. 1986; 46: 1011-1021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Second, the strand exchange (a major mechanism in DNA recombination) is governed by (−)supercoiling (8Heichman K.A. Moskowitz I.P.G. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Kanaar R. van de Putte P. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kanaar R. Kahmann R. Cozzarelli N.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Third, (−)supercoiling is needed to melt or unwind recombination sites after the productive synaptic complex is formed (21Benjamin K.R. Abola A.P. Kanaar R. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Not only the requirement of (−)supercoiling and its roles but also many biochemical activities of recombinases, such as the DNA cleavage activity in synaptic complexes and binding specificity, are remarkably similar in different site-specific recombination systems. The recombinases described above (except λ integrase) cleave the middle of recombination sites to which they are bound and are transiently attached to the cleaved DNA by a phosphodiester bond between a serine residue (at position 9, or 10) and the 5′-phosphate end of DNA (7Johnson R.C. Bruist M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Hatfull G.F. Grindley N.D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5429-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,23Klippel A. Mertens G. Patschinsky T. Kahmann R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1229-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 24Kanaar R. Klippel A. Shekhtman E. Dungan J.M. Kahmann R. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1990; 62: 353-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Stark W.M. Boocock M.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, there has been two models to account for strand exchange after DNA cleavage. In one model, subunits of bound dimers exchange along with DNA strands (subunit exchange or simple rotation model; 8, 19, 24, 25). In the other model, protein-guided strand exchange occurs between juxtaposed recombination sites without exchange of subunits (26Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1514-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One of the terms to define topological state of a covalently closed circular DNA is the linking number (Lk). Lk is the number of turns one strand of DNA makes around the other. The Lk of (−)supercoiled DNA is less than that of relaxed DNA (Lk0). If Lk of a covalently closed circular DNA is greater than Lk0, then the DNA is positively (+) supercoiled. As the result of the linking number difference (ΔLk), which is equal to Lk − Lk0, (−)supercoiled DNA is said to be underwound and (+)supercoiled DNA is overwound (27Sinden R.R. DNA Structure and Function. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). Therefore, the handedness of supercoiling between the two different forms is opposite. Although there is evidence that positive supercoiling could be biologically relevant (28Nadal M. Mirambeau G. Forterre P. Reiter W.-D. Duguet M. Nature. 1986; 321: 256-258Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar), covalently closed circular DNA isolated from most of organisms is negatively supercoiled. Thus, it is likely that Hin that requires (−)supercoiled DNA to perform its roles has evolved without facing (+)supercoiled DNA. A simple curiosity on what would happen if Hin is reacted with (+)supercoiled DNA drove us to initiate this study. Would Hin and Fis bind to (+)supercoiled DNA? Would they perform inversion as they have done on (−)supercoiled DNA? If they don't, then in which step is the inversion reaction blocked? Whatever the results (either positive or negative) may be, we contemplated that the results would be informative to understand the system in detail. Furthermore, we were particularly interested in strand exchange on (+)supercoiled DNA because (+)supercoiled DNA is different from (−)supercoiled DNA in handedness and state of double helical twist that are likely to matter in strand exchange. Therefore, we have generated a positively supercoiled plasmidin vitro using reverse gyrase isolated from a thermophilic Archaeon and subjected it to a Hin-mediated inversion system. Our results showed that on (+)supercoiled plasmid, Hin, and Fis could bind to their binding sites, and Hin could pair hix sites. Detailed assays showed that Hin was able to cleave the hixsites on (+)supercoiled DNA but was not able to exchange the cleaved strands. The cleavage activity of Hin on (+)supercoiled DNA was Fis-dependent as it was on (−)supercoiled DNA. Therefore, Hin and Fis reacted with (+)supercoiled DNA as they do with (−)supercoiled DNA except at the strand exchange step. Consequences of these results are discussed in detail. Hin was prepared fromEscherichia coli strain DH1 harboring a plasmid pHL104 in which the wild-type hin gene is placed under the control of the tac promoter. Hin proteins were induced with 0.1 mm IPTG at 25 °C. The essential steps for purification of Hin were performed as described by Johnson and Simon (2Johnson R.C. Simon M.I. Cell. 1985; 41: 781-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). At the end of purification, fractions containing Hin were pooled and dialyzed against a buffer containing 50% glycerol, and 1 m NaCl. Purified Hin was not contaminated with Fis and was 60% pure as estimated by scanning the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Hewlett Packard Scanjet IICX). Fis proteins were purified to homogeneity by the method of Johnson et al. (4Johnson R.C. Bruist M.F. Simon M.I. Cell. 1986; 46: 531-539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. Reverse gyrase was isolated from Sulfolobus shibatae as described by Nadalet al. (29Nadal M. Couderc E. Duguet M. Jaxel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Negatively supercoiled plasmids were purified from E. coli strain DH10B by CsCl ultracentrifugation. Negatively supercoiled pKH336 (20 μg) was incubated at 75 °C for 45 min with 3,000 units of reverse gyrase (29Nadal M. Couderc E. Duguet M. Jaxel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in an 80-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.55 mmdithiothreitol, 0.55 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm ATP, 7% polyethylene glycol 6000 (Microselect for molecular biology, Fluka), 2.5 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 10 mm NaCl, 0.005% Triton X-100 (sulfact-Amps, Pierce), and 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After incubation, NaCl was added at a final concentration of 500 mm, and the incubation was continued for 2 min. SDS and Na2EDTA were added at final concentrations of 0.9% and 9 mm, respectively. After addition of 40 μg of proteinase K (Merck), the reaction mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 1.5 h. DNA was extracted three times with 2 volumes of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. The positively supercoiled form was separated from the open circular form on agarose gel, and an agarose block containing the positively supercoiled form was cut out. Positively supercoiled DNA was isolated again from the agarose block using Geneclean (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). Care was taken to minimize nicking during the whole procedure. Binding reaction for Hin (30 μl) was set up in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl. This buffer supports both Hin binding andNcoI cleavage. Different amounts of Hin protein (0, 150, 300, and 600 ng) were mixed with 0.25 μg of pKH336 in 30 μl of reaction mixture. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, 7.5 units ofNcoI were added to each sample. Incubation continued for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. Phenol and chloroform extraction were performed to remove proteins, and the extent of NcoI cleavage was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis using TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mmNa2EDTA). Agarose gels were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) for 10 min followed by destaining in water for 30 min. Agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of chloroquine was performed in TAE buffer containing chloroquine (4 μg/ml) at room temperature. Chloroquine was removed by soaking the gel in 1 mm MgSO4 for 1 h, and ethidium bromide staining was done as above. Polaroid 665 films were used to take pictures, and negatives were scanned by a densitometer (Hewlett Packard Scanjet IICX) when necessary. Fis-binding assay was performed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fis (56 ng) was incubated with 1.75 μg of pKH336 at 37 °C for 10 min in 175 μl of reaction followed by addition of 10 units of the restriction enzyme MfeI. An aliquot (25 μl) was removed at 0 (before the addition of MfeI) and 20 s and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 min. DNA cleavage activity of MfeI in each sample was immediately blocked by adding 2 μl of 500 mmNa2EDTA followed by phenol and chloroform extraction. The extent of MfeI cleavage was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as above. In vitro inversion reaction was performed as described by Lim et al. (6Lim H.M. Hughes K.T. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11183-11190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 25 μl of inversion buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml polycytidylic acid). Hin (300 ng) and Fis (8 ng) were reacted with 0.5 μg of pKH336 at 37 °C for 1 h. DNA precipitated by ethanol was digested withPstI and ClaI, and the extent of inversion was measured by agarose gel electrophoresis as above. This assay was followed as described by Lim et al. (6Lim H.M. Hughes K.T. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11183-11190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hin (300 ng) was incubated with 0.5 μg of pKH336 in 25 μl of cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Na2EDTA, 100 μg/ml polycytidylic acid, 30% ethylene glycol) at 37 °C for 20 min followed by the addition of 1 μl of 6% glutaraldehyde. Incubation was continued for an additional 20 min at room temperature. Glutaraldehyde was removed by dialysis against 250 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. Dialysis was performed for 45 min at room temperature using a MicrodialyzerTM(Pierce). Dialysates were digested with PstI andClaI (5 units each). The paired-hix structure was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as above. Hin cleavage reactions (7Johnson R.C. Bruist M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were performed in 50 μl of the cleavage buffer above. Hin (600 ng) and Fis (16 ng) were mixed with 1 μg of pKH336. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was divided in half, and 25 μl of each half was transferred to a new tube. To analyze the extent of cleavage, 1 μl each of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) and of 10% SDS were added to one tube, and incubation at 37 °C was continued for an additional 30 min. This reaction was kept on ice until the other half (for chase) was finished. To the other half of the cleavage reaction, 125 μl of the inversion buffer above were added (chasing). Two min after, phenol and chloroform extraction were performed. DNA recovered from ethanol precipitation was digested withPstI and ClaI (5 units each). The cleaved product (from the first half of the reaction) and inverted product (from the second half) were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described above. Plasmid pKH336 was used as a substrate plasmid in our previous report that dissected the role of negative supercoiling in Hin-mediated inversion reaction (9Lim H.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11176-11182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have generated positively supercoiled pKH336 ((+)pKH336) by using reverse gyrase (30Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 31Forterre P. Mirambeau G. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Duguet M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2123-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) isolated from a thermophilic Archaeon S. shibatae (29Nadal M. Couderc E. Duguet M. Jaxel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). This enzyme converted negatively supercoiled pKH336 ((−)pKH336) into a highly (+)supercoiled form in the presence of ATP and polyethylene glycol (Fig. 2). To confirm the integrity of the reverse gyrase-generated (+)pKH336, agarose gel electrophoresis was performed with and without chloroquine (Fig. 2). Chloroquine, a DNA-intercalating agent, unwinds the DNA double helix upon binding. Because the Lk is the sum of writhe (superhelical turns) and twist, the unwinding effect of chloroquine-binding will lower twist of the plasmid. This, in turn, increases writhe because Lk does not change unless the backbone of DNA is broken and rejoined. Therefore, a certain amount of chloroquine will remove supercoiling (relaxation) from (−)pKH336 and add more supercoiling to (+)pKH336 (32Shure M. Pulleyblank D.E. Vinograd J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 1183-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Snounou G. Malcolm A.D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the presence of 4 μg/ml concentration of chloroquine (Fig. 2,lane 3), the single band of (−)pKH336 in Fig. 2, lane 1 was resolved in many topoisomers relaxed by chloroquine (lane 3). However, (+)pKH336 moved as a fast moving single band without (lane 2) and with (lane 4) chloroquine demonstrating that (+)pKH336 generated by reverse gyrase is highly (+)supercoiled. Scanning of negatives showed that supercoiled form in (−)pKH336 preparation was about 90% and that in (+)pKH336 preparation was 55%. Positively supercoiled DNA seemed to be stained less by ethidium bromide than (−)supercoiled or open-circular DNA. Thus, the amount of (+)pKH336 in lane 2 of Fig. 2 was underestimated when negatives were scanned. We considered that the amount of (+) topoisomers in (+)pKH336 preparation would be about 60% rather than 55%. Thus, the amount of (+)pKH336 in lane 2 is 67% of that of (−)pKH336 in lane 1. Most of the open circular forms in both preparations seemed rather to be nicked than relaxed because they did not change mobility in agarose gel with chloroquine. To know the minimum linking number difference (ΔLk) of (+)pKH336 in Fig. 2, lane 2, we have generated a series of topoisomers of (+)pKH336 with a lesser amount of reverse gyrase and have counted the number of topoisomers from the totally relaxed to the point where normal agarose gel cannot resolve. The number was 14 (data not shown). Therefore, (+)pKH336 shown in lane 2 of Fig. 2 is composed of a group of topoisomers with ΔLk greater than +14. Because our previous experiments with topoisomers of (−)pKH336 showed that topoisomers with ΔLk of less than −14 were competent in inversion (9Lim H.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11176-11182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we assumed that (+)pKH336 with ΔLk more than +14 would be competent for assays designed to observe the intermediates in Hin-mediated reactions. Next, we have performed a standard Hin-mediated inversion reaction with (+)pKH336. After the reaction, DNA was precipitated with ethanol followed by PstI andClaI restriction enzyme digestion to observe inversion. All the restriction enzymes used in this work were able to cleave their recognition sites on (+)pKH336 as well as those on (−)pKH336. Data shown in Fig. 3 a demonstrated that the extent of inversion in 1 h with (+)pKH336 is less than 1% of that with (−)pKH336. When inversion reactions were loaded onto an agarose gel without restriction digestion of substrate plasmids, (−)pKH336 showed a typical pattern of Hin-mediated relaxed topoisomers due to multiple rounds of inversion (1Johnson R.C. Bruist M.B. Glaccum M.B. Simon M.I. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 751-760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but no relaxation was observed in (+)pKH336 (Fig. 3 b). These data suggest that Hin could not change the topology of (+)pKH336. To see which step of inversion reaction was blocked on (+)pKH336, a series of biochemical assays that could analyze each step of inversion reaction (binding, pairing of hix, DNA cleavage, and strand rotation) were performed with (+)pKH336. Binding activity of Hin to hix and Fis to the enhancer on (+)pKH336 was analyzed by using restriction enzymes that recognize and cut each binding site. The binding assay is based on the rationale that once the restriction enzyme site is occupied by DNA binding proteins such as Hin or Fis, the site is no longer cleavable by the restriction enzyme (6Lim H.M. Hughes K.T. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11183-11190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because this binding assay method utilizes supercoiled DNA, it was adequate to measure DNA binding activity of Hin and Fis on (+) and (−)pKH336. pKH336 has two identical hixsites (hixL-AT; see Ref. 8Heichman K.A. Moskowitz I.P.G. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1622-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) containing 5′-CCATGG-3′ sequence that is the cleavage site of restriction enzyme NcoI. The reaction buffer for NcoI cleavage and that for Hin binding were almost identical (see “Experimental Procedures”). Hin-binding reactions (with an increasing amount of Hin) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min followed by NcoI digestion for 1 h. TheNcoI cleavage pattern in the presence of different amounts of Hin between (−) and (+)pKH336 were identical (Fig.4), suggesting that Hin binds to hix sites regardless of the handedness of supercoiling. One of the Fis-binding sites in the enhancer (proximal domain) has 5′-CAATTG*-3′ sequence that contains the guanine residue (G*) critical in Fis binding (34Bruist M.F. Glasgow A.C. Johnson R.C. Simon M.I. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 762-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and can be cleaved by MfeI restriction enzyme. pKH336 has an enhancer sequence between the hixsites. Thus, there is a unique MfeI site in pKH336. In Fis-binding assay with MfeI, we measured the time ofMfeI cleavage with a fixed amount of Fis. When Fis was not present, MfeI (1.5 units) was able to digest 0.25 μg of (+)pKH336 completely within 4 min. However, in the presence of 8 ng of Fis (the amount used in a standard inversion reaction), about 10% of (+)pKH336 was left uncleaved even after 8 min (Fig.5 a), indicating that the rate of restriction digestion slows down by a factor of little more than 2. The slower cleavage rate ofMfeI suggests that Fis binds to the enhancer sequence on (+)pKH336. The same binding experiment was performed with (−)pKH336, and the results were exactly the same as (+)pKH336 shown in Fig.5 b. As a control, we performed MfeI cleavage reaction on a (−)supercoiled plasmid, which has a uniqueMfeI site and no enhancer sequences, with and without the presence of Fis. The cleavage activity of MfeI was not affected by the presence of Fis (data not shown), suggesting that Fis alone does not inhibit the activity of MfeI. These suggest that Fis also binds quantitatively and qualitatively well to the enhancer regardless of superhelical handedness. These data also suggest that the binding of Fis to enhancer is not as stable as shown in gel mobility shift assays (34Bruist M.F. Glasgow A.C. Johnson R.C. Simon M.I. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 762-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The reason for this is, we believe, that the MfeI reaction buffer in which the Fis-binding assay was performed was radically different from that used in gel mobility shift assays. To test whether Hin bound at distant hix sites can interact with each other to bring the hix sites in close proximity on (+)pKH336, Hin was reacted with (+) and (−)pKH336, and interacting Hin dimers were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde followed by restriction enzyme digestion. The resulting nucleoprotein structures were resolved on agarose gel (9Lim H.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11176-11182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bands labeled as T in Fig. 6 represent the paired-hix structure. The amount of T band on (+)pKH336 (lane 4) was 90% of that of (−)pKH336 (lane 3), suggesting that paired-hix can be formed on (+)pKH336. Considering that the amount of supercoiled population in (+)pKH336 was 67% of that in (−)pKH336 (Fig. 2) and that (−)supercoiling promotes formation of the paired-hix structure (9Lim H.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11176-11182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Fig. 6 demonstrated that Hin makes the paired-hix structure on (+)pKH336 as efficiently as on (−)pKH336. Next, we investigated the Hin-mediated DNA cleavage on (+)pKH336. In a buffer containing no Mg2+ and 30% ethylene glycol and 10 mm EDTA, Hin, Fis, and negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA are needed to form the synaptic complex (invertasome) in which Hin cleaves the middle of hixsites and remains attached to the cleaved DNA strand via a phosphoserine linkage (5Heichman K.A. Johnson R.C. Science. 1990; 249: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Johnson R.C. Bruist M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, to observe the resulting cleaved DNA bands (between the two hix sites and the rest of the vector) in agarose gel, the reaction should be treated with SDS and proteinase K to remove Hin proteins covalently linked to DNA. The cleaved DNA bands labeled as Cleaved in Fig. 7 a (lanes 1 and 2) showed that the extent of Hin-mediated cleavage on (+)pKH336 is about 60% of (−)pKH336. Again, considering the amount of supercoiled population in preparation of (+)pKH336 is 67% of that in (−)pKH336 and that the cleavage activity of Hin requires supercoiled DNA, it is likely that the overall efficiency of Hin-mediated DNA cleavage on (+)pKH336 is almost the same as that on (−)pKH336. To resolve this point clearly, we have prepared (+)pKH336 with a lesser amount of open circular form from the preparation of (+)pKH336 shown in Fig. 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this newly prepared (+)pKH336, the open circular form constituted less than 10%, which was the same value of (−)pKH336 preparation (data not shown). When 0.25 μg (standard reaction has 0.5 μg of DNA) of both (−) and newly made (+)pKH336 were subjected to the cleavage assay, Hin showed the same efficiency of DNA cleavage activity (Fig. 7 c). Thus, these results demonstrated that Hin was able to cleave the middle of hixregardless of supercoiling handedness. To see if Fis is required in cleavage reaction with (+)pKH336 as it is with (−)pKH336, Fis was deleted from the cleavage reaction. As shown in Fig. 7 b (lanes 1 and 2), without Fis, the cleavage activity of Hin on both pKH336 dropped. In reactions with (−)pKH336, the cleaved DNA in the absence of Fis (Fig.7 b, lane 1) was 14% of that in the presence of Fis (Fig. 7 a, lane 1), and in reactions with (+)pKH336, the cleaved band formed without Fis was 25% of that with Fis (lanes 2 of Fig. 7, a and b, respectively). These suggest that Fis is also required for an efficient DNA cleavage on (+)pKH336. The invertasome, accumulated in a buffer with 30% ethylene glycol and no Mg2+, is able to finish inversion within 30 s if MgCl2 is added and the concentration of ethylene glycol becomes <5% by dilution (7Johnson R.C. Bruist M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When the cleavage reaction with (−)pKH336 was chased to produce inverted products, more than 95% of the cleaved products (Fig. 7 a, lane 1) became inverted (Fig. 7 a, lane 3), but less than 5% the cleaved products assembled on (+)pKH336 (Fig.7 a, lane 2) gave rise to inversion (Fig.7 a, lane 4), suggesting that most of the cleaved products on (+)pKH336 were religated back to the original configuration. Hin was able to bind to hix sites on (+)pKH336. This suggests that Hin protein is flexible enough to accommodate the structural changes of hix sites, such as changes in the helical repeats and the average rotation per nucleotide reside, due to the overwinding of the double helix in (+)supercoiling. This was not a surprising result because Hin has been shown to bind tohix sites residing either on linear DNA or on (−)supercoiled DNA (underwound) with the same affinity (3Glasgow A.C. Bruist M.F. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10072-10082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once Hin binds to hix sites, it stays there more than 2 h on (−)supercoiled DNA. 2H. M. Lim, unpublished results. This was also true on (+)supercoiled DNA used in this study (data not shown). Unlike Hin, Fis showed unstable binding at the enhancer on (−)supercoiled DNA (Fig. 5). The comparably unstable binding property of Fis was the same on (+)pKH336 (Fig. 5). The reason for the unstable binding of Fis was because the Fis-binding buffer used in this study was quite different from that used in gel mobility shift assays. However, we believed that the Fis-binding assays we performed are enough to show that Fis binds to the enhancer on (+)pKH336 as well as on (−)pKH336. Hin could even make the paired-hix structure on (+)pKH336 as well as on (−)pKH336, suggesting that Hin dimers bound to eachhix site on (+)pKH336 already have acquired conformational changes necessary to physically associate with each other and that (+)supercoiling could also promote the hix-pairing activity. It was demonstrated that (−)supercoiling promotes formation of the paired-hix structure (9Lim H.M. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11176-11182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results draw a general conclusion that binding and some other functional properties (DNA cleavage activity of restriction enzymes and hix-pairing activity of Hin) of the proteins tested in this study are not changed on (+)supercoiled plasmid. The efficiency of inversion on (+)pKH336 in 1 h was less than 1% of that on (−)pKH336 (Fig. 3 a), suggesting that a step of inversion is blocked or extremely slow on (+)pKH336. Binding, and hix-pairing assays all showed that steps before formation of the synaptic nucleoprotein complex are identical on the two different topological states of pKH336. Three lines of evidence support that Hin is able to make a synaptic nucleoprotein complex on (+)supercoiled plasmid, which are functionally identical to that assembled on (−)supercoiled plasmid. First, under the invertasome formation condition (30% ethylene glycol without Mg2+), Hin was able to cleave the middle of hixsites on (+)pKH336 as it was on (−)supercoiling. Second, the cleavage activity of Hin on (+)pKH336 also required Fis (Fig. 7). Without Fis, invertasome structures were not observed under electron microscopy, and cleavage activity of Hin dropped from 45 to 11% on a (−)supercoiled substrate plasmid (5Heichman K.A. Johnson R.C. Science. 1990; 249: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Johnson R.C. Bruist M.F. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Third, to observe the cleaved DNA fragment between the two hix sites on (+)pKH336 on agarose gel, SDS-proteinase K treatment of the cleavage reaction was necessary, suggesting that Hin is covalently attached to the cleaved DNA ends in the synaptic complex formed in (+)pKH336. In the cleavage reaction with (−)pKH336, more than 95% of the cleaved DNA readily (in 2 min at most) gave rise to inverted product when the reaction condition was changed for inversion (chasing). However, less than 5% of the cleaved DNA assembled on (+)pKH336 was chased to inversion (Fig. 7 a), suggesting that the step after the DNA cleavage, strand exchange, was either inefficient or blocked in the synaptic complex formed on (+)pKH336. However, that most of the cleaved DNA on (+)pKH336 were readily religated back to the original configuration instead of being in the progression of strand exchange in the chase assay (Fig. 7 a) suggests that the strand exchange on (+)pKH336 is blocked rather than inefficient. One h of incubation of the standard inversion reaction with (+)pKH336 did not produce more inversion products (Fig. 3 a) than did the 2-min chase assay with (+)pKH336 (Fig. 7 a). Thus, we believe that the small amount of inversion observed on (+)pKH336, either in the standard inversion or in the chase experiment, could have come from the nicked population of (+)pKH336 or unknown, but inversion competent, topoisomers of pKH336. Certain structural changes in hix-bound Hin due to the local alterations in DNA structure, such as different helical repeats or altered average rotation per residue in (+)pKH336, could account for this result. However, Hin and Fis were all involved in DNA cleavage and in religation of the cleaved DNA on (+)pKH336. Furthermore, restriction enzymes were equally functional on both (−) and (+)pKH336. It is hard to imagine that on (+)pKH336, Hin protein that was inactive in strand rotation became active in religation. Therefore, we eliminated the possibility of structural changes in Hin on (+)supercoiled DNA during strand exchange. Based on the topological features of the synaptic complex of Gin formed on (−)supercoiled plasmid DNA, it was suggested that (−)supercoiling dictates strand exchange and the result from this is the right-handed rotation (clockwise) of the cleaved DNA (20Klippel A. Kanaar R. Kahmann R. Cozzarelli N.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The (−)supercoiling-dictated right-handed rotation of the cleaved DNA is energetically favorable because it releases the torsional tension stored in (−)supercoiling (21Benjamin K.R. Abola A.P. Kanaar R. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, under certain conditions, strand exchange can occur through either orientation (counterclockwise or clockwise) in γδ and Tn3-mediated resolution and Gin-mediated inversion reactions (19Stark W.M. Sherratt D.J. Boocock M.R. Cell. 1989; 58: 779-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 20Klippel A. Kanaar R. Kahmann R. Cozzarelli N.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 35Stark W.M. Grindley N.D.F. Hatful G.F. Boocock M.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3541-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggesting that the direction of strand exchange on (+)supercoiled DNA that is energetically favorable (if it occurs) would be left-handed (counterclockwise) rotation. Taken together, these considerations suggest that in the synaptic complex formed on (+)pKH336, features other than the superhelical handedness of (+)supercoiling block the strand rotation. The major different property of (+)supercoiling from that of (−) is that it is overwound. It is a well known fact that (−)supercoiling promotes transient unwinding of the double helix. The energy of (−)supercoiling can induce, by its linking number deficit, spontaneous unwinding of peculiar DNA regions even in the absence of protein. The binding of a protein to this unwound DNA region displaces the equilibrium to the unwound state of the DNA (36Drew H.R. Weeks J.R. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Transient unwinding could be seen in the initiation of transcription during open complex formation (37McClure W.P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), and in the beginning of DNA replication at the origin of DNA replication (38Hwang D.S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23083-23086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, since (+)supercoiled DNA has an excess of linking number (overwound), this unwinding reaction would be greatly inhibited. The difference between (−) and (+)supercoiling led us to suggest that the synaptic complex formed on (+)pKH336 may be blocked in the process of unwinding probably at the center of hix sites and, thus, indicating that melting at the center of hix could be critical for strand exchange. Recently, Benjamin et al. (21Benjamin K.R. Abola A.P. Kanaar R. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) also proposed that in the postsynaptic complex of Tn3 resolvase and at the Gin recombination sites (gix), (−)supercoiling might be needed to unwind the double helix. The authors came to this conclusion from the results of the experiments with catenated plasmids. It is interesting that our data with (+)supercoiled DNA also suggests the same conclusion. However, results presented in this work might indicate another important point in understanding the cleavage and strand exchange mechanism in invertases and probably in resolvases. Our data may suggest that the unwinding process in recombination sites is needed after DNA cleavage prior to strand exchange.
