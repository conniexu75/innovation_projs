https://openalex.org/W1908561802,"G-protein-coupled receptors have a major role in transmembrane signalling in most eukaryotes and many are important drug targets. Here we report the 2.7 A resolution crystal structure of a beta(1)-adrenergic receptor in complex with the high-affinity antagonist cyanopindolol. The modified turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) receptor was selected to be in its antagonist conformation and its thermostability improved by earlier limited mutagenesis. The ligand-binding pocket comprises 15 side chains from amino acid residues in 4 transmembrane alpha-helices and extracellular loop 2. This loop defines the entrance of the ligand-binding pocket and is stabilized by two disulphide bonds and a sodium ion. Binding of cyanopindolol to the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor and binding of carazolol to the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor involve similar interactions. A short well-defined helix in cytoplasmic loop 2, not observed in either rhodopsin or the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor, directly interacts by means of a tyrosine with the highly conserved DRY motif at the end of helix 3 that is essential for receptor activation."

Previously, the p110-alpha isoform has been implicated in growth factor and insulin signalling, as well as in tumorigenesis. Now the analysis of mutant mice reveals a major role for p110-beta in the regulation of insulin-dependent metabolic changes and in tumour formation. Interestingly, some of the effects are mediated by a kinase-independent function of p110-beta. On activation by receptors, the ubiquitously expressed class IA isoforms (p110α and p110β) of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) generate lipid second messengers, which initiate multiple signal transduction cascades1,2,3,4,5. Recent studies have demonstrated specific functions for p110α in growth factor and insulin signalling6,7,8. To probe for distinct functions of p110β, we constructed conditional knockout mice. Here we show that ablation of p110β in the livers of the resulting mice leads to impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, while having little effect on phosphorylation of Akt, suggesting the involvement of a kinase-independent role of p110β in insulin metabolic action. Using established mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found that removal of p110β also had little effect on Akt phosphorylation in response to stimulation by insulin and epidermal growth factor, but resulted in retarded cell proliferation. Reconstitution of p110β-null cells with a wild-type or kinase-dead allele of p110β demonstrated that p110β possesses kinase-independent functions in regulating cell proliferation and trafficking. However, the kinase activity of p110β was required for G-protein-coupled receptor signalling triggered by lysophosphatidic acid and had a function in oncogenic transformation. Most strikingly, in an animal model of prostate tumour formation induced by Pten loss, ablation of p110β (also known as Pik3cb), but not that of p110α (also known as Pik3ca), impeded tumorigenesis with a concomitant diminution of Akt phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions for p110β, and strongly indicate the kinase-dependent functions of p110β as a promising target in cancer therapy."

Niche architecture becomes pronounced postnatally at the start of the first hair cycle. Whether SCs exist or function earlier is unknown. Here we show that slow-cycling cells appear early in skin development, express SC markers, and later give rise to the adult SC population. To test whether these early slow-cycling cells function as SCs, we use Sox9-Cre for genetic marking and K14-Cre to embryonically ablate Sox9, an essential adult SC gene. We find that the progeny of Sox9-expressing cells contribute to all skin epithelial lineages and Sox9 is required for SC specification. In the absence of early SCs, hair follicle and sebaceous gland morphogenesis is blocked, and epidermal wound repair is compromised. These findings establish the existence of early hair follicle SCs and reveal their physiological importance in tissue morphogenesis.

These findings establish the existence of early hair follicle SCs and reveal their physiological importance in tissue morphogenesis. Adult stem cells (SCs) maintain tissues during normal homeostasis and wound repair. SCs frequently reside in specific niches that provide the appropriate microenvironment and molecular cues to preserve proliferative and tissue regenerative potential, the hallmarks of SCs (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006Blanpain C.

Stem cells and their niches.Science. 2006; 311: 1880-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). In mammalian hair follicles (HFs), SCs reside in a relatively quiescent state within a permanent, anatomically distinct region of the follicle known as the bulge. In adult mice, bulge SCs can contribute to all three epithelial lineages of skin (Blanpain et al., 2004Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Geoghegan A. Polak L. Fuchs E.

During normal homeostasis, bulge SCs are periodically activated to fuel postnatal hair cycles. While the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and sebaceous gland (SG) both contain resident populations of unipotent progenitor cells, multipotent bulge SCs can provide a cellular input to both of these lineages in a wound environment. While all HFs have initiated development by P0 when mice are born, bulge niche architecture is not pronounced until 3 weeks after birth (∼P20 to P21) when mice already have a full hair coat (Cotsarelis, 2006Cotsarelis G.

The distinctive appearance of the bulge at this age coincides with the onset of the growth phase (anagen) of the first postnatal hair cycle. Where the adult bulge SCs come from and how they organize within a niche remains unknown. It has been widely assumed that bulge SCs are not needed for embryonic morphogenesis, where HFs develop from epidermis rather than the base of preexisting bulge niches. In support of this notion, two widely used bulge SC markers, CD34 and a keratin 15-LacZ reporter gene, are both upregulated at ∼P20 (Blanpain et al., 2004Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Geoghegan A. Polak L.

The isolation and transcriptional profiling of bulge SCs have revealed many new markers that offer additional insights into the characteristics and behavior of follicle SCs. Among the upregulated bulge genes are transcription factors Lhx2, Sox9, Tcf3, and Nfatc1 (Blanpain et al., 2004Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Geoghegan A. Polak L. Fuchs E.

Interestingly and in contrast to CD34, their expression begins early in HF morphogenesis, with Lhx2 and Sox9 appearing at the placode stage and Tcf3 and Nfatc1 appearing later during the peg stage (Horsley et al., 2008Horsley V.

While null mutations in all four genes cause embryonic lethality, skin grafts from Lhx2 and Nfatc1 null embryos develop HFs that contain functional SC niches but display reduced SC quiescence (Horsley et al., 2008Horsley V.

Y10:Cre/Sox9(fl/fl) mice target Sox9 ablation to postnatal skin, revealing hair-cycle defects that include a failure of adult bulge SCs to form and/or express CD34 (Vidal et al., 2005Vidal V.P. Chaboissier M.C. Lutzkendorf S. Cotsarelis G. Mill P. Hui C.C. Ortonne N. Ortonne J.P. Schedl A.

Biol. 2005; 15: 1340-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of these adult follicle SC transcription factors and their expression in embryonic skin, it is not known whether these genes function during morphogenesis. It is similarly unclear how and when the SC niche is established, an issue that is poorly understood for most tissues harboring stem cells. In this report, we use a combination of genetics, cell biology, and in vivo functional assays to investigate the specification and initial function of epithelial SCs in the hair follicle. We find that these SCs are specified during the earliest stages of HF morphogenesis and that initial SC specification critically depends on Sox9. Furthermore, we find that early SCs can contribute to all three skin epithelial lineages and in their absence, the normal morphogenesis of HFs and SGs is blocked and epidermal wound repair is severely compromised. In order to determine when the quiescent bulge SC population is first specified, we modified in vivo pulse-chase experiments previously employed for labeling adult bulge cells with histone H2B-GFP (Tumbar et al., 2004Tumbar T. Guasch G. Greco V. Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Rendl M. Fuchs E. Defining the epithelial stem cell niche in skin.Science. 2004; 303: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Similar to our previous strategy, we used K5-Tetoff mice to control keratin 5 (K5)-positive skin epithelial expression of histone H2B-GFP driven by a tetracycline regulatable enhancer, but in this case, we began our chase at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5). At this early time, most hair follicles have been specified but are still in the early stages of morphogenesis. In unchased embryos, all skin epithelial cells displayed H2B-GFP epifluorescence, consistent with strong K5 promoter activity by E13.5 (Figure 1A). After 3 days of chase (P2), the brightest H2B-GFP cells in the epidermis were in nonproliferative suprabasal layers, as expected from the upward mode of terminal differentiation in this tissue. Surprisingly, the brightest cells in the hair follicle were concentrated in a relatively narrow zone (bracketed) of outer root sheath (ORS). After 9 days of chase when HF downgrowth was nearly complete (P8), H2B-GFP label-retaining cells (LRCs) clustered prominently within this upper ORS zone. Marking completion of the pilosebaceous unit (Schmidt-Ullrich and Paus, 2005Schmidt-Ullrich R. Paus R. Molecular principles of hair follicle induction and morphogenesis.Bioessays. 2005; 27: 247-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), SGs had emerged just above these LRCs (Figure 1A). Consistent with their relatively slow-cycling nature, these early follicle LRCs were largely negative for proliferative nuclear protein Ki67, which instead marked many cells located both above (infundibulum) and below (matrix) this zone (Figure 1A). In mature follicles, a thin trail of H2B-GFP-positive cells (arrowheads) extended down the ORS from the concentrated LRC zone toward the hair bulb, which contains the highly proliferative, transit-amplifying population of matrix cells responsible for hair production. Intriguingly, some of the cells within this trail displayed decreased nuclear epifluorescence intensity and some were also negative for Ki67, suggestive of a potential precursor-product relation between brighter H2B-GFP LRCs in the upper ORS and dimmer H2B-GFP cells in the lower ORS. Use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to quantify label retention in keratinocytes from fractionated epidermis or HFs (dermis) revealed that unchased HF keratinocytes expressed relatively uniform amounts of label at E18.5, but after 3 days of chase, the spectrum of GFP fluorescence had broadened, indicating that most HF keratinocytes had divided several times (Figure S1A). Over 4 days of chase, the HF GFP spectrum continued to broaden and diminish in intensity, reflecting rapid cell divisions. That said, a clear tail of GFP-high cells persisted, indicative of a less proliferative subset of HF cells. The variable rates of HF cell division contrasted starkly with the more uniform epidermal cell division rates reflected by symmetric distributions of label retention (Figure S1A). To determine whether early LRCs might be related to adult follicle SCs, we conducted immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies against a number of adult bulge markers and compared their localization patterns with H2B-GFP (Figure 1B). Consistent with prior reports (Nguyen et al., 2006Nguyen H. Rendl M. Fuchs E. Tcf3 governs stem cell features and represses cell fate determination in skin.Cell. 2006; 127: 171-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, Vidal et al., 2005Vidal V.P.

Biol. 2005; 15: 1340-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), transcription factors Tcf3 and Sox9 were expressed in P8 ORS. While not restricted to H2B-GFP LRCs, Tcf3- and Sox9-positive cells included the LRC zone (brackets). Notably, Nfatc1 and Lhx2 were also expressed in the LRC zone and displayed even greater restriction than Tcf3 and Sox9 (arrowheads). Whether embryonic or adult, the only other place where Nfatc1, Lhx2, and LRCs are known to colocalize is in adult bulge SCs (Horsley et al., 2008Horsley V. Aliprantis A.O. Polak L. Glimcher L.H. Fuchs E. NFATc1 balances quiescence and proliferation of skin stem cells.Cell. 2008; 132: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, Rhee et al., 2006Rhee H. Polak L. Fuchs E. Lhx2 maintains stem cell character in hair follicles.Science. 2006; 312: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Tumbar et al., 2004Tumbar T. Guasch G. Greco V. Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Rendl M. Fuchs E. Defining the epithelial stem cell niche in skin.Science. 2004; 303: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). To directly evaluate the relation between early follicle LRCs and adult bulge SCs, we labeled mice until E18.5 and then chased until P21, when the first postnatal hair cycle is initiated (Blanpain et al., 2004Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Geoghegan A. Polak L. Fuchs E. Self-renewal, multipotency, and the existence of two cell populations within an epithelial stem cell niche.Cell. 2004; 118: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). After an entire cycle of hair growth, LRCs marked by H2B-GFP during embryogenesis were still present at P21 where they localized to the CD34-positive adult bulge SC niche and secondary hair germ (HG) (Figure 1C). This result, confirmed by FACS analysis on 22 day chased mice (Figure S1B), established that the early LRC population present in chased P2 and P8 follicles is the major contributor to the adult bulge cells that appear at P20 to P21. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a quiescent population of cells is specified early in HF development, that LRCs localize to a specific region of the growing HF where they express many SC markers, and that early LRCs persist to form the adult bulge. Notably, all of these quiescent, presumptive bulge cells lost some label during a 22 day chase that covered the first complete hair cycle, leading us to postulate that these cells play an active role in HF morphogenesis before being called upon to drive the periodic growth of the adult hair cycle. To determine whether early LRCs might be important for HF morphogenesis, we traced expression of the known SC markers that we found to colocalize with these cells. Of the four bulge transcription factors, only Lhx2 and Sox9 were known to be expressed in the early hair placodes (Rhee et al., 2006Rhee H. Polak L. Fuchs E. Lhx2 maintains stem cell character in hair follicles.Science. 2006; 312: 1946-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Vidal et al., 2005Vidal V.P. Chaboissier M.C. Lutzkendorf S. Cotsarelis G. Mill P. Hui C.C. Ortonne N. Ortonne J.P. Schedl A. Sox9 is essential for outer root sheath differentiation and the formation of the hair stem cell compartment.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1340-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We focused on Sox9 as a particularly good candidate for regulating LRC establishment during embryogenesis, since fortuitous postnatal HF targeting of Sox9(fl/fl) mice with a Y10:Cre transgene had resulted in adult HFs that lacked CD34 and that could not be maintained (Vidal et al., 2005Vidal V.P. Chaboissier M.C. Lutzkendorf S. Cotsarelis G. Mill P. Hui C.C. Ortonne N. Ortonne J.P. Schedl A. Sox9 is essential for outer root sheath differentiation and the formation of the hair stem cell compartment.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1340-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In WT E14.5 embryos, the skin was marked by uniform E-cadherin expression, and Sox9 protein was not present (Figure 2A). As predicted from the pattern of Sox9 in situ hybridization (Vidal et al., 2005Vidal V.P. Chaboissier M.C. Lutzkendorf S. Cotsarelis G. Mill P. Hui C.C. Ortonne N. Ortonne J.P. Schedl A. Sox9 is essential for outer root sheath differentiation and the formation of the hair stem cell compartment.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1340-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), Sox9 protein marked developing placodes as soon as they could be architecturally discerned in the main waves of HF specification (E15.5-P0). Interestingly and unexpectedly, however, nuclear Sox9 protein resided in the suprabasal cells of the placode rather than in the P-cadherin and Lhx2-positive basal layer (Figure 2B). No previous studies on genes or signaling pathways have uncovered the existence of this unique Sox9-positive cell population within the placode. By the peg stage, Sox9-expressing cells concentrated in a region in the upper ORS with moderate P-cadherin expression, while the brightest PCad-positive cells localized to the leading edge of developing follicles (Figure 1C). Once sebaceous glands (SG) emerged, it was clear that this Sox9-expressing ORS zone encompassed the presumptive bulge region (Figure 2D). By P2, a trail of Sox9-positive cells extended down the ORS, diminishing toward the matrix which was negative for Sox9. As previously reported (Vidal et al., 2005Vidal V.P. Chaboissier M.C. Lutzkendorf S. Cotsarelis G. Mill P. Hui C.C. Ortonne N. Ortonne J.P. Schedl A. Sox9 is essential for outer root sheath differentiation and the formation of the hair stem cell compartment.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1340-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), the bulge SCs of adult HFs were positive for Sox9 (Figure 2E). Real-time PCR on FACS-purified skin cells revealed background levels of Sox9 mRNA expression in all populations besides ORS, validating the accuracy of our Sox9 immunofluorescence results (Figure 2F). Given the similarity between Sox9 expression and LRC location in developing HFs, we wondered whether Sox9-expressing cells in embryonic skin might actively contribute to HF morphogenesis. To test this possibility, we conducted a genetic marking analysis using Sox9-Cre/R26R skin. In this assay, Sox9-Cre-expressing cells become permanently marked for LacZ expression, and all progeny of Sox9-Cre-expressing cells can then be readily monitored over time by β-galactosidase cleavage of XGal to generate a blue dye. Although some portions of backskin express Sox9-Cre as early as E10.5 (Akiyama et al., 2005Akiyama H. Kim J.E. Nakashima K. Balmes G. Iwai N. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Martin J.F. Behringer R.R. Nakamura T. et al.Osteo-chondroprogenitor cells are derived from Sox9 expressing precursors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 14665-14670Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), tailskin, which is similar to backskin (Braun et al., 2003Braun K.M. Niemann C. Jensen U.B. Sundberg J.P. Silva-Vargas V. Watt F.M. Manipulation of stem cell proliferation and lineage commitment: visualisation of label-retaining cells in wholemounts of mouse epidermis.Development. 2003; 130: 5241-5255Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), was free of Sox9-Cre activity prior to HF development. At E18.5, tailskin XGal reactivity paralleled Sox9 immunolabeling, specifically marking cells in the upper portion of developing HFs, but remaining absent from the leading edge of HFs and the IFE (Figure 2G). By P8, however, HFs were almost entirely blue, demonstrating that the population of Sox9-expressing cells in the upper ORS had contributed not only to all differentiated layers of the growing HF but also the SG. By the end of the first telogen (P21), Sox9-derived progeny encompassed most if not all cells of the HF, including those of the infundibulum, SG, bulge, and secondary hair germ, but were absent from IFE (Figure 2G). In normal homeostasis, a resident unipotent progenitor population within the IFE maintains skin turnover. In response to wounding, however, adult bulge SCs can be recruited to the IFE to assist in repair (Ito et al., 2005Ito M. Liu Y. Yang Z. Nguyen J. Liang F. Morris R.J. Cotsarelis G.

Interestingly in P3 Sox9-Cre/R26R mice, scratch wounding resulted in a robust contribution of Sox9-Cre-marked HF cells into the regenerating IFE (Figure 2G). Taken together, these studies revealed that Sox9-expressing cells within developing skin display key properties of adult HF stem cells in that they contribute to HF and SG morphogenesis and can repair an injured IFE. In conditionally targeted Y10:Cre/Sox9(fl/fl) mice, HFs produced an atrophic hair coat that was retained into adulthood thereby directing that study to a role for Sox9 in the adult hair cycle (Vidal et al., 2005Vidal V.P.

In light of our finding that a Sox9-marked bulge may form during skin embryogenesis, however, we were intrigued that hair defects had been noted in Y10:Cre/Sox9(fl/fl) mice as early as P8 (Vidal et al., 2005Vidal V.P. Chaboissier M.C. Lutzkendorf S. Cotsarelis G. Mill P. Hui C.C. Ortonne N. Ortonne J.P. Schedl A. Sox9 is essential for outer root sheath differentiation and the formation of the hair stem cell compartment.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1340-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To directly test whether Sox9 is functionally required for skin morphogenesis, we targeted Sox9 ablation using K14-Cre, active in skin by E13.5. At E16.5, when many follicles are present only as placodes, the Sox9 locus had been efficiently targeted (Figure S2; Figure 3A). At birth, K14-Cre/Sox9(fl/fl) (cKO) mice were phenotypically distinguished from WT by an 80% reduction in whisker number, and at P6, when the hair coat first appears, cKO mice displayed a smooth epidermal surface with no sign of protruding hairs. As cKO mice aged, they remained completely devoid of a hair coat (Figure S2). These findings strongly supported an early role for Sox9. The effects of Sox9 ablation during embryogenesis appeared to be specific for the early SC population in the presumptive bulge. Thus, despite a morphologically intact, keratin 17-positive ORS, the thickening that normally marks the location of early Sox9-positive bulge cells was missing (Figure S3A; Figure 3B). Moreover, in contrast to WT HFs, where nuclear Nfatc1 marked a few cells within the presumptive bulge, Nfatc1 was never detected in developing cKO skin (Figure 3C; Figure S3B). Additionally, even though Sox9 was absent in cKO hair germs, Lhx2 was still expressed initially in its normal location at the leading edge; however, Lhx2 failed to appear subsequently in the presumptive bulge (Figure 3D). Finally, although Tcf3 was detected initially in the ORS of developing cKO follicles, it was progressively lost during the first week after birth (Figure 3E). Notably, the earliest disappearance of Tcf3 occurred within the presumptive bulge region and then proceeded unidirectionally toward the follicle base (Figure 3E). Although establishment of early bulge architecture and gene expression was clearly impaired in developing Sox9-deficient HFs, it remained possible that early bulge cells were still present within the ORS but could no longer be identified by these criteria. Since our studies had shown that early bulge cells reduce their cycling rate as they develop, we conducted an embryonic BrdU pulse-chase to see if early LRCs were also lost when Sox9 was absent. Strikingly, significant differences in the numbers of cKO follicles with LRCs were already evident by P2 and by P6, follicles with LRCs were diminished by ∼8× fold (Figure 3F; Figure S3C). The dramatic reduction in LRCs in the presumptive bulge of Sox9-deficient neonatal HFs was accompanied by a substantial increase in proliferation in this zone. A 6 hr pulse of BrdU at P6 revealed an increase of ∼40% in BrdU-labeled cells within the total Sox9 cKO upper ORS population, mostly concentrated in the region of the presumptive bulge (Figure 3G). Similar differences were observed with proliferation markers Ki67 and G1/S-regulatory kinase Cdk4 (Figures S3D and S3E). Our findings unveiled new requirements for Sox9, namely in the early expression and maintenance of transcription factors and slow-cycling bulge SC features that we found to be established during embryogenesis, long before other bulge markers, such as CD34, appear. When taken together with our earlier label-retaining and genetic marking studies, these additional data provided compelling evidence that not only does a population of early bulge stem cells form during skin development, but that its features critically rely upon one of the transcription factors that marks it. We next addressed our finding that Sox9-dependent early bulge SCs form during HF morphogenesis in the context of the absent hair coat phenotype of Sox9 cKO mice. Histological analysis of skin from our P0 cKO mice revealed no significant differences in overall HF density or developmental stage (Figure 4A; Figure S4A). By contrast, differences in HF length were already evident at P0, and by P6, cKO follicles averaged ∼60% the length of WT follicles (Figure 4A). Despite gross perturbations in HF length, overall morphology and biochemical features of HF differentiation were relatively normal, and the ORS, inner root sheath (IRS), and hair shaft all appeared to be present and correctly organized (Figures S4B–S4H). Importantly, K14-Cre targeted Sox9 ablation efficiently prior to the main waves of HF specification and well before differentiated HF lineages developed. Thus, rather than specifying HFs or governing their differentiation, Sox9 appeared"

We generated genetically homogeneous 'secondary' somatic cells that carry the reprogramming factors as defined doxycycline (dox)-inducible transgenes. These cells were produced by infecting fibroblasts with dox-inducible lentiviruses, reprogramming by dox addition, selecting induced pluripotent stem cells and producing chimeric mice. Cells derived from these chimeras reprogram upon dox exposure without the need for viral infection with efficiencies 25- to 50-fold greater than those observed using direct infection and drug selection for pluripotency marker reactivation. We demonstrate that (i) various induction levels of the reprogramming factors can induce pluripotency, (ii) the duration of transgene activity directly correlates with reprogramming efficiency, (iii) cells from many somatic tissues can be reprogrammed and (iv) different cell types require different induction levels. This system facilitates the characterization of reprogramming and provides a tool for genetic or chemical screens to enhance reprogramming."

Using mouse ESCs in which gene expression can be temporally regulated, we have found that transient expression of Mesp1 dramatically accelerates and enhances multipotent cardiovascular progenitor specification through an intrinsic and cell autonomous mechanism.

Mesp1 also directly represses the expression of key genes regulating other early mesoderm and endoderm cell fates.

The heart is the first functional organ that is formed during embryonic development. The ancestor of the primitive heart is estimated to have arisen about 500 million years ago, since the core transcriptional machinery required for cardiac differentiation has been extremely conserved during evolution (Davidson and Erwin, 2006Davidson E.H.

Cardiac progenitors are specified during the early stages of gastrulation as soon as the epiblast cells are incorporated within the cranial portion of the primitive streak. Around embryonic day 6 (E6.0) in mice, the prospective cardiogenic mesoderm migrates away from the primitive streak bilaterally and cranially to form the anterior and lateral plate mesoderm (E6.5), where the cardiac crescent, corresponding to the primary heart field, appears at around E7.0 (Abu-Issa and Kirby, 2007Abu-Issa R.

The cells of the cardiac crescent migrate medially and form a linear single heart tube, which will give rise to the cells of the left ventricle and atria. Complex looping and rotation of the heart tube, as well as the addition of cells coming from the secondary heart field, giving rise to the right ventricle and the outflow track, generate a four-chambered heart (Buckingham et al., 2005Buckingham M.

Various lines of evidence have suggested that different cardiac cell types, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, as well as conduction cells, which compose the mature heart tissue, arise from the differentiation of multipotent cardiovascular progenitors (MCPs) generated soon after gastrulation (Garry and Olson, 2006Garry D.J.

ESC differentiation represents a very attractive model to dissect the molecular mechanisms implicated in cardiovascular cell-fate specification but also may represent an ideal source of cardiovascular cells for cellular therapy in humans (Martin-Puig et al., 2008Martin-Puig S. Wang Z. Chien K.R. Lives of a heart cell: tracing the origins of cardiac progenitors.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 320-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although the gene regulatory network of transcription factors involved in cardiac determination, proliferation, patterning, and differentiation is relatively well known, the early molecular mechanism that induces the specification of multipotent cardiovascular cell fate from undifferentiated mesoderm remains largely unknown (Abu-Issa and Kirby, 2007Abu-Issa R. Kirby M.L. Heart field: from mesoderm to heart tube.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 45-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, Olson, 2006Olson E.N. Gene regulatory networks in the evolution and development of the heart.Science. 2006; 313: 1922-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). It is still unclear what are the intrinsic or extrinsic factors that induce cardiovascular progenitor specification and coordinate the expression of cardiac transcription factors at the right time and at the right place. Expression of Mesp1, a transcription factor of the b-HLH family, is one of the earliest signs of cardiovascular development in vertebrates (Saga et al., 2000Saga Y. Kitajima S. Miyagawa-Tomita S. Mesp1 expression is the earliest sign of cardiovascular development.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 345-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). During gastrulation in mice, Mesp1 is strongly expressed at the onset of gastrulation (E6.5) along the primitive streak and in the prospective cardiac mesoderm and is then rapidly downregulated after E7.5 (Saga et al., 1996Saga Y. Hata N. Kobayashi S. Magnuson T. Seldin M.F. Taketo M.M. MesP1: a novel basic helix-loop-helix protein expressed in the nascent mesodermal cells during mouse gastrulation.Development. 1996; 122: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lineage-tracing experiments using mice in which the Cre recombinase has been knocked in into the Mesp1 locus demonstrated that most cardiac cells and some vascular cells arise from cells that expressed Mesp1 at one point of their development (Saga et al., 1999Saga Y. Miyagawa-Tomita S. Takagi A. Kitajima S. Miyazaki J. Inoue T. MesP1 is expressed in the heart precursor cells and required for the formation of a single heart tube.Development. 1999; 126: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mesp1 null mice present a severe defect in heart morphogenesis that has been attributed to a delay in cardiac progenitor migration (Saga et al., 1999Saga Y. Miyagawa-Tomita S. Takagi A. Kitajima S. Miyazaki J. Inoue T. MesP1 is expressed in the heart precursor cells and required for the formation of a single heart tube.Development. 1999; 126: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The double Mesp1/2 null mice exhibit a major defect in gastrulation resulting in the absence of mesoderm formation (Kitajima et al., 2000Kitajima S. Takagi A. Inoue T. Saga Y. MesP1 and MesP2 are essential for the development of cardiac mesoderm.Development. 2000; 127: 3215-3226PubMed Google Scholar). This dramatic and early gastrulation defect has precluded molecular characterization of the specific role of Mesp1/2 during cardiac specification, and left open the question about the precise mechanism by which Mesp1 acts during cardiac development. Does Mesp1 only promote the migration of cardiac progenitors toward the lateral plate mesoderm, or does Mesp1 instruct the primitive mesoderm to become MCPs? To dissect the cellular and the molecular mechanism by which Mesp1 acts during cardiac specification, we took advantage of the natural differentiation of ESCs into MCPs and the ease of their genetic manipulation (Murry and Keller, 2008Murry C.E. Keller G. Differentiation of embryonic stem cells to clinically relevant populations: lessons from embryonic development.Cell. 2008; 132: 661-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). We showed that, during ESC differentiation, Mesp1 is expressed very transiently, reminiscent of its expression during embryonic development. By transiently overexpressing Mesp1 during ESC differentiation, we drastically accelerated and promoted specifically cardiovascular cell fate through a cell autonomous mechanism. Using genome wide transcriptional analysis after Mesp1 induction, we uncovered a discrete set of genes that are rapidly regulated upon Mesp1 induction. We showed that Mesp1 both directly activated many key genes belonging to the core cardiac transcriptional machinery and directly repressed genes promoting early mesoderm and endoderm cell-fate specification. Mesp1 first transiently stimulated its own endogenous expression through a direct positive autoregulatory loop and then inhibited its own expression, therefore, acting as a molecular switch during cardiac specification. Altogether, our results provide compelling evidence that Mesp1 acts as a cardiovascular master regulator during specification of MCPs during ESC differentiation. We first examined by RT-PCR the temporal expression of key transcription factors implicated in the transition from pluripotent ESCs to cardiac terminal differentiation (Figure 1A). As previously shown (Kattman et al., 2006Kattman S.J. Huber T.L. Keller G.M.

Cell. 2006; 11: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, Kouskoff et al., 2005Kouskoff V. Lacaud G. Schwantz S. Fehling H.J. Keller G.

USA. 2007; 104: 3859-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), when pluripotent ESCs are induced to differentiate, the temporal appearance of the key transcriptional factors implicated in mesoderm and cardiac commitment is very similar to the temporal expression of these genes during embryonic development (Murry and Keller, 2008Murry C.E. Keller G. Differentiation of embryonic stem cells to clinically relevant populations: lessons from embryonic development.Cell. 2008; 132: 661-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Genes regulating the specification of the primitive streak, such as Brachyury, are strongly and rapidly upregulated. Mesp1 began to be expressed soon after, peaked at day 4, and then was rapidly downregulated. Key cardiac transcription factors began to be expressed at days 3 to 4, peaking around day 6. Cardiac structural genes, such as troponinT, began to be expressed at day 5 and peaked at day 8, and their expression was maintained thereafter, in good accordance with the contractile phenotype of the cells observed upon microscopic inspection (Figure 1B). To study the role of Mesp1 during cardiac cell-fate specification, we generated a recombinant ESC line in which the expression of an epitope-tagged version of Mesp1 followed by an IRES-GFP can be temporally and specifically induced upon doxyclin (Dox) addition (Figure S1A available online) (Kyba et al., 2002Kyba M. Perlingeiro R.C. Daley G.Q. HoxB4 confers definitive lymphoid-myeloid engraftment potential on embryonic stem cell and yolk sac hematopoietic progenitors.Cell. 2002; 109: 29-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). To determine whether Mesp1 directly promotes cardiac specification, we induced the expression of Mesp1 from day 2 to day 3, 1 day earlier than its endogenous expression, and monitored the temporal appearance of beating EBs. In the absence of Dox, no expression of transgene was detectable by FACS, western blot, or immunostaining analysis (Figures S1B–S1D). Upon Dox addition, Mesp1 is rapidly induced, and 12 hr after Dox administration, Mesp1 is clearly seen in the nucleus of ESCs. After 24 hr, about 80% of ESCs expressed Mesp1 (Figures S1B–S1D). The precocious expression of Mesp1 resulted in an acceleration of cardiac differentiation as demonstrated by the premature appearance of beating cells in the EB culture, which occurred at day 7, a day earlier than in untreated cells or control GFP-inducible ESCs treated with Dox (Figure 1B). A close observation of the EBs revealed an increased number of beating zones within EBs that have been stimulated with Mesp1 (Movies S1 and S2). Immunofluorescence and FACS analysis demonstrated the precocious and increased expression of TroponinT, a cardiac specific marker, following Mesp1 induction (Figures 1C–1F). Mesp1-stimulated cells generated four to five times more cardiac cells (Figures 1E and 1F), which represents one, if not the greatest, promotion of cardiac differentiation induced by a single factor. During embryonic development or ESC differentiation, cardiac cells are thought to arise from the differentiation of MCPs (Murry and Keller, 2008Murry C.E. Keller G. Differentiation of embryonic stem cells to clinically relevant populations: lessons from embryonic development.Cell. 2008; 132: 661-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). To determine whether Mesp1 promotes the specification of MCPs or whether its effect is restricted to the promotion of cardiac differentiation, we analyzed, by RT-PCR and immunostaining, the expression of markers specific for different types of mature cardiovascular cells. Mesp1 increased the expression of cardiac transcription factors (Figure 2A), pancardiac markers (Figures 1C and 2A; Figure S2A), ventricular markers (Figures 2A and 2B), atrial markers (Figures 2A and 2C), as well as markers of pace maker cells (Figure 2A). In addition to promoting myocardial differentiation, Mesp1 also accelerated and promoted the differentiation of vascular cells as shown by the precocious and increased expression of CD31 and VE-Cadherin (Figures 2A and 2D) and smooth muscle cells as shown by expression of smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Figure 2E). Altogether, the three main cell lineages arising from the differentiation of MCPs represent about 50%–60% of all cell lineages following Mesp1 induction. The similar promotion and acceleration of ESC differentiation into cardiac, vascular, and smooth muscle cells suggested that Mesp1 induced the specification of MCPs rather than just promoting cardiac differentiation. Two distinct sources of cardiogenic mesoderm give rise to MCPs during embryonic development and ESC differentiation (Buckingham et al., 2005Buckingham M. Meilhac S. Zaffran S. Building the mammalian heart from two sources of myocardial cells.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 826-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, Laugwitz et al., 2008Laugwitz K.L. Moretti A. Caron L. Nakano A. Chien K.R. Islet1 cardiovascular progenitors: a single source for heart lineages?.Development. 2008; 135: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The primary heart field originates from the anterior splanchnic mesoderm and gives rise to the cardiac crescent, which contributes to the development of left ventricle and atria. The secondary heart field is derived from the pharyngeal mesoderm, anterior to the cardiac crescent, and is marked by the expression of Islet1 (Isl1), a transcription factor of the LIM-homeo-domain family. During ESC differentiation, Isl1 protein is first detected around D6 and reaches its maximum at D8, and its expression can be used to isolate multipotent cardiovascular progenitors of the secondary heart field (Moretti et al., 2006Moretti A. Caron L. Nakano A. Lam J.T. Bernshausen A. Chen Y. Qyang Y. Bu L. Sasaki M.

To determine whether Mesp1 promotes the specification of MCPs from the primary and/or the secondary heart field, we monitored the expression of Isl1 following Mesp1 induction. In Mesp1 stimulated cells, Isl1 mRNA expression was increased 4 days after Dox addition (D6). This effect was only transient, and Isl1 expression returned to the control level at D8 (Figure 2F). Immunostaining of EBs revealed the precocious expression of Isl1 in Mesp1-stimulated cells in which EBs at D6 contained as many Isl1-positive cells as control cells 2 days later (Figure 2G). Immunostaining revealed the presence of cells that coexpressed Isl1, Flk1, and Nkx2-5 following Mesp1 induction, consistent with the specification of MCPs from the secondary heart field by Mesp1 (Figure S2B) (Moretti et al., 2006Moretti A. Caron L. Nakano A. Lam J.T. Bernshausen A. Chen Y. Qyang Y. Bu L. Sasaki M.

To determine whether Mesp1 promotes the fate of other cell types during ESC differentiation, we analyzed the expression of a panel of markers specific for a wide range of differentiated cells that are produced after 10 days of ESC differentiation (Keller, 2005Keller G. Embryonic stem cell differentiation: emergence of a new era in biology and medicine.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1129-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Besides promoting an increase in the expression of cardiovascular markers, Mesp1 also increased the expression of hepatic markers such as albumin, alpha-feto protein, and TCF1 (Figure 2H), consistent with known cell nonautonomous-promoting effect of cardiac cells during liver development (Zaret, 2000Zaret K.S. Liver specification and early morphogenesis.Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Mesp1 also promoted the expression of striated muscle cell markers such as MyoD or Myogenin (Figure 2H), but this effect only appeared around day 10 (Figure 2H and data not shown) during the late stage of ESC differentiation potentially related to the later expression and function of Mesp1 in the presomitic and somitic mesoderm (Saga, 1998Saga Y. Genetic rescue of segmentation defect in MesP2-deficient mice by MesP1 gene replacement.Mech. Dev. 1998; 75: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Takahashi et al., 2005Takahashi Y. Kitajima S. Inoue T. Kanno J. Saga Y. Differential contributions of Mesp1 and Mesp2 to the epithelialization and rostro-caudal patterning of somites.Development. 2005; 132: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression of markers for other mesodermal derivatives, such as hematopoieitic tissue (Gata1, Tie2), bone (runx2, Col1a1), endodermal, or ectodermal derivatives were unchanged or relatively decreased in Mesp1 stimulated cells (Figure 2H). To identify the cellular mechanisms by which Mesp1 promotes MCP specification, we first determined whether the addition of conditioned media (CM) from Mesp1-stimulated cells to control cells could recapitulate the cardiac-promoting effect of Mesp1 expression (Figure S3A). The daily addition of CM from Mesp1-stimulated cells did not promote or accelerate cardiac differentiation in control cells (Figure S3B), indicating that Mesp1 does not promote cardiovascular specification by the secretion of soluble proteins. To validate these observations, we cocultured Mesp1-IRES-GFP EBs with EBs that expressed the red fluorescent protein DsRed (Figure S3C). While 80% EBs that expressed Mesp1 (GFP positive) showed beating zones at day 7, only 20% of neighboring EBs that expressed DsRed presented signs of cardiac contraction at this stage (Figure S3D). We quantified this effect by determining the expression of troponinT in cells expressing Mesp1 (GFP positive) and in control cells (DsRed) by FACS analysis (Figure S3E). At day 8, 18% of Mesp1 stimulated cells expressed troponinT, whereas only 4% of the DsRed cells of the neighboring coculture EBs expressed this marker, similar to control cells. As a more rigorous test of an autonomous or nonautonomous mechanism, we generated chimeric EBs in which ESCs conditionally expressing Mesp1 and DsRed are mixed together to form EBs containing both cell types (Figure 3A). These chimeric EBs were stimulated with Dox, and cardiac differentiation (troponinT +) was measured in the Mesp1 (GFP+) or control (DsRed+) cells by FACS. At D8, the percentage of troponinT-positive cells was much higher in Mesp1-stimulated cells (15%) than in DsRed cells that had been in direct contact with Mesp1 stimulated cells (6%) or in DsRed cells than have been in direct contact with GFP cells (4%) (Figure 3B). These results showed that Mesp1 promotes cardiac specification through an intrinsic and cell autonomous mechanism. After 48 hr of Mesp1 induction, EBs were bigger and presented two times more cells than control EBs (Figures S4A and S4B). However, the growth advantage of Mesp1-stimulated cells was only transient as 3 days after Mesp1 induction, both Mesp1-stimulated and control cells grew at the same rate (Figure S4B). FACS analysis 48 hr after Mesp1 induction revealed that Mesp1 induction did not significantly modify the cell-cycle profile of these cells (Figure S4C), but apoptosis was significantly reduced in Mesp1-stimulated cells (Figure S4D), suggesting that the transient growth advantage observed following Mesp1 induction is related to a transient inhibition of apoptosis. The small and transient cell growth advantage observed in Mesp1-stimulated cells contrasted with the major increase in cardiovascular differentiation induced by Mesp1, suggesting that Mesp1 promotes cardiovascular cell-fate specification through an instructive rather than selective mechanism. To uncover the molecular mechanisms by which Mesp1 induced cardiovascular specification, we performed a genome-wide analysis of Mesp1-regulated genes. We determined which genes were regulated upon Mesp1 induction by at least 1.5-fold in two separate experiments. Mesp1 regulated a discrete set of genes (586 of 45101 probes), corresponding to 1.3% of the murine genome. Among the 423 unique annotated genes that were rapidly modulated upon Mesp1 induction, 276 were upregulated, whereas 148 were downregulated, suggesting that Mesp1 exerts its function by both positive and negative regulation of gene expression. Cardiac morphogenesis and differentiation are governed by an evolutionarily conserved set of transcriptional factors that regulate the expression of genes implicated in morphogenesis and patterning during heart development as well as the genes required for cardiac terminal differentiation (Olson, 2006Olson E.N. Gene regulatory networks in the evolution and development of the heart.Science. 2006; 313: 1922-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Our microarray analysis revealed that Mesp1 induced the rapid upregulation of many, if not all, genes belonging to the core cardiac transcriptional machinery: Hand2, Gata4, Gata6, Tbx 20, or Myocardin (Table 1). In addition to these genes, we found that Nkx2-5 and Mef2c, although not listed in our microarray analysis due to their low levels of expression, were also upregulated by RT-PCR (Figure 4A). Other genes playing important role during cardiovascular development, such as Hey2 or Foxc1 (Fischer et al., 2004Fischer A. Schumacher N. Maier M. Sendtner M. Gessler M.

https://openalex.org/W2082645493,"<h2>Summary</h2> Mature mammary epithelial cells are generated from undifferentiated precursors through a hierarchical process, but the molecular mechanisms involved, particularly in the human mammary gland, are poorly understood. To address this issue, we isolated highly purified subpopulations of primitive bipotent and committed luminal progenitor cells as well as mature luminal and myoepithelial cells from normal human mammary tissue and compared their transcriptomes obtained using three different methods. Elements unique to each subset of mammary cells were identified, and changes that accompany their differentiation in vivo were shown to be recapitulated in vitro. These include a stage-specific change in NOTCH pathway gene expression during the commitment of bipotent progenitors to the luminal lineage. Functional studies further showed NOTCH3 signaling to be critical for this differentiation event to occur in vitro. Taken together, these findings provide an initial foundation for future delineation of mechanisms that perturb primitive human mammary cell growth and differentiation."

While simple models of a single self-renewal signal are attractive, niche-stem cell interactions are likely to be more complex. Many niches have multiple cell types, and the Drosophila testis is one such complex niche with two stem cell types, germline stem cells (GSCs) and somatic cyst progenitor cells (CPCs). These stem cells require chemokine activation of Jak/STAT signaling for self-renewal. We identified the transcriptional repressor Zfh-1 as a presumptive somatic target of Jak/STAT signaling, demonstrating that it is necessary and sufficient to maintain CPCs. Surprisingly, sustained zfh-1 expression or intrinsic STAT activation in somatic cells caused neighboring germ cells to self-renew outside their niche. In contrast, germline-intrinsic STAT activation was insufficient for GSC renewal. These data reveal unexpected complexity in cell interactions in the niche, implicating CPCs in GSC self-renewal.

Adult stem cells contribute a steady source of new cells to maintain tissues of many types. The potential to use these stem cells in regenerative medicine, however, is hampered by a lack of knowledge in how they are normally regulated within their niches. Study of Drosophila male and female gonads has greatly increased our general knowledge about how niches regulate stem cells, contributing such ideas as localized domains competent for self-renewal, mechanisms of asymmetric stem cell divisions, and the ability of differentiating cells to “dedifferentiate” (reviewed in Fuller and Spradling, 2007Fuller M.T. Spradling A.C. Male and female Drosophila germline stem cells: two versions of immortality.Science. 2007; 316: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) While these advances have provided useful paradigms for understanding niches in higher organisms, many niches remain poorly understood because they are inherently more complex, containing multiple cell types. Understanding how multiple cell types interact to create complex niche environments in which stem cell populations can function is a largely unexplored frontier. The Drosophila testis niche supports two stem cell populations, and as such, it has potential to provide insights into how complex niches function. Each germline stem cell (GSC) division is accompanied by divisions of two cyst progenitor cells (CPCs). The differentiating daughters of the CPC division are called cyst cells, and they invest themselves around the differentiating daughter of the GSC, called the gonialblast. The gonialblast undergoes transit amplifying (TA) divisions and then differentiates, all the while surrounded by these two cyst cells. Since differentiation of the germ cells is clearly dependent upon crosstalk with the cyst cells at several different stages (Fabrizio et al., 2003Fabrizio J.J. Boyle M. DiNardo S.

Somatic control over the germline stem cell lineage during Drosophila spermatogenesis.Nature. 2000; 407: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), it is essential that GSCs and CPCs are both maintained in the niche, and that there is close to a 1:2 ratio of GSCs to CPCs. Mechanisms regulating this balance are unknown. There are hints that the Drosophila ovarian niche may achieve this balance via GSC dependence on a signal from the accompanying somatic stem cell population (Decotto and Spradling, 2005Decotto E. Spradling A.C. The Drosophila ovarian and testis stem cell niches: similar somatic stem cells and signals.Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In testes, both the CPCs and GSCs cluster around a group of nondividing somatic cells called the hub (Hardy et al., 1979Hardy R.W. Tokuyasu K.T. Lindsley D.L. Garavito M. The germinal proliferation center in the testis of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1979; 69: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The hub is the source of the self-renewal signal Unpaired (Upd) (Figure 1B), a ligand that activates Jak/STAT signaling in surrounding cells (both somatic and germ cells). Upd availability is restricted such that only cells near the hub significantly activate Jak/STAT signaling and thereby adopt stem cell fate (Kiger et al., 2001Kiger A.A. Jones D.L. Schulz C. Rogers M.B. Fuller M.T. Stem cell self-renewal specified by JAK-STAT activation in response to a support cell cue.Science. 2001; 294: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, Tulina and Matunis, 2001Tulina N. Matunis E. Control of stem cell self-renewal in Drosophila spermatogenesis by JAK-STAT signaling.Science. 2001; 294: 2546-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Daughters that are displaced from the hub via oriented cell divisions move out of the signal's influence and differentiate (Yamashita et al., 2003Yamashita Y.M. Jones D.L. Fuller M.T. Orientation of asymmetric stem cell division by the APC tumor suppressor and centrosome.Science. 2003; 301: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). STAT is intrinsically required in GSCs for their self-renewal and is also thought to be required for CPC self-renewal (Kiger et al., 2001Kiger A.A. Jones D.L. Schulz C. Rogers M.B. Fuller M.T. Stem cell self-renewal specified by JAK-STAT activation in response to a support cell cue.Science. 2001; 294: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, Tulina and Matunis, 2001Tulina N. Matunis E. Control of stem cell self-renewal in Drosophila spermatogenesis by JAK-STAT signaling.Science. 2001; 294: 2546-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of self-renewal for either lineage is poorly understood in part because no targets of STAT function in the stem cells have been identified. Upd misexpression causes all daughters of GSC divisions to retain stem cell fate (Kiger et al., 2001Kiger A.A. Jones D.L. Schulz C. Rogers M.B. Fuller M.T. Stem cell self-renewal specified by JAK-STAT activation in response to a support cell cue.Science. 2001; 294: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, Tulina and Matunis, 2001Tulina N. Matunis E. Control of stem cell self-renewal in Drosophila spermatogenesis by JAK-STAT signaling.Science. 2001; 294: 2546-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar); it has therefore been assumed that direct activation of STAT signaling in germ cells by Upd is sufficient to specify self-renewal. Upd misexpression, however, also generates excess CPCs, which embrace the germ cells (Tulina and Matunis, 2001Tulina N. Matunis E. Control of stem cell self-renewal in Drosophila spermatogenesis by JAK-STAT signaling.Science. 2001; 294: 2546-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Hence, it is unclear whether each lineage independently self-renews in response to ectopic Upd or whether renewal of one lineage relies on the other, presumably via GSC-CPC crosstalk. As a way to identify targets of STAT activation, whether direct or indirect, and new regulatory circuits operative in this complex niche, we undertook transcriptional profiling experiments. By comparing testes with ectopic upd expression to normal testes, we identified RNAs predicted to be enriched in the excess GSCs and CPCs (Terry et al., 2006Terry N.A. Tulina N. Matunis E. DiNardo S. Novel regulators revealed by profiling Drosophila testis stem cells within their niche.Dev. Biol. 2006; 294: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One such gene was zfh-1, encoding a transcriptional repressor with multiple zinc fingers and a homeodomain (Fortini et al., 1991Fortini M.E. Lai Z.C. Rubin G.M. The Drosophila zfh-1 and zfh-2 genes encode novel proteins containing both zinc-finger and homeodomain motifs.Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). zfh-1 is required for numerous developmental fate decisions during embryogenesis, including specification of the somatic gonadal precursors (Broihier et al., 1998Broihier H.T. Moore L.A. Van Doren M. Newman S. Lehmann R. zfh-1 is required for germ cell migration and gonadal mesoderm development in Drosophila.Development. 1998; 125: 655-666PubMed Google Scholar). Of the vertebrate homologs, δEF1/zfhx1a and SIP1/zfhx1b, zfhx1b is thought to be the zfh-1 ortholog (Liu et al., 2006Liu M. Su M. Lyons G.E. Bodmer R. Functional conservation of zinc-finger homeodomain gene zfh1/SIP1 in Drosophila heart development.Dev. Genes Evol. 2006; 216: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and in heterozygous state is the cause of human Mowat-Wilson syndrome, a form of Hirschsprung disease associated with severe mental retardation (Zweier et al., 2002Zweier C. Albrecht B. Mitulla B. Behrens R. Beese M. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Rott H.D. Rauch A. “Mowat-Wilson” syndrome with and without Hirschsprung disease is a distinct, recognizable multiple congenital anomalies-mental retardation syndrome caused by mutations in the zinc finger homeo box 1B gene.Am. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 108: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Here we examined the role of zfh-1 in the Drosophila testis niche. We found that zfh-1 is activated by STAT signaling, and it plays a central role in the maintenance of undifferentiated CPC fate via its role as a transcriptional repressor. Our work also revealed an unsuspected role for CPCs assisting in GSC self-renewal. In various tissues, it has been shown that signaling by Upd leads to activation and accumulation of STAT protein (Chen et al., 2002Chen H.W. Chen X. Oh S.W. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Hou S.X. mom identifies a receptor for the Drosophila JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway and encodes a protein distantly related to the mammalian cytokine receptor family.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the testis, STAT accumulation is restricted mostly to germline and somatic cells next to the hub (Figure 1A), consistent with hub cells being the source of Upd (Figure 1B) (Kiger et al., 2001Kiger A.A. Jones D.L. Schulz C. Rogers M.B. Fuller M.T. Stem cell self-renewal specified by JAK-STAT activation in response to a support cell cue.Science. 2001; 294: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, Tulina and Matunis, 2001Tulina N. Matunis E. Control of stem cell self-renewal in Drosophila spermatogenesis by JAK-STAT signaling.Science. 2001; 294: 2546-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the germ cells next to the hub take on GSC fate, and stat mutant GSCs differentiate (Kiger et al., 2001Kiger A.A. Jones D.L. Schulz C. Rogers M.B. Fuller M.T. Stem cell self-renewal specified by JAK-STAT activation in response to a support cell cue.Science. 2001; 294: 2542-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, Tulina and Matunis, 2001Tulina N. Matunis E. Control of stem cell self-renewal in Drosophila spermatogenesis by JAK-STAT signaling.Science. 2001; 294: 2546-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). While it has been assumed that CPCs also intrinsically require STAT activation, this has not been tested directly. We found that STAT is indeed intrinsically required in CPCs, either for survival or self-renewal, as stat null CPC clones were rapidly lost (Table 1). Similar data have been obtained by C. Brawley, M. de Cuevas, and E. Matunis (personal communication). The fact that stat was essential in the somatic lineage and that its accumulation was restricted to cells near the hub suggested that key self-renewal genes would be similarly restricted in their expression, and Zfh-1, identified in our expression profiling experiments (Terry et al., 2006Terry N.A. Tulina N. Matunis E. DiNardo S. Novel regulators revealed by profiling Drosophila testis stem cells within their niche.Dev. Biol. 2006; 294: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), met these criteria.Table 1Percent of Testes Containing One or More ClonesDays after InductionGSC ClonesCPC ClonesTestes ScoredControl (82B)aControl clones increase from 2 days to 4 days after induction due to a lag in GFP accumulation with the MARCM system.2 days13.017.4934 days37.056.2738 days25.026.192STAT06346 bSTAT clones in transit amplifying germ cells were observed at all time points, indicating that clones were induced.2 days10.26.1494 days14.00868 days00.9109STAT85c9 bSTAT clones in transit amplifying germ cells were observed at all time points, indicating that clones were induced.2 days1.611.3624 days2.70758 days01.187zfh-165.342 days25.90814 days42.90918 days46.51.099zfh-175.262 days11.01.51364 days45.701518 days25.8089CtBPDE102 days27.92.3434 days60.01.8558 days45.2084a Control clones increase from 2 days to 4 days after induction due to a lag in GFP accumulation with the MARCM system.b STAT clones in transit amplifying germ cells were observed at all time points, indicating that clones were induced. Open table in a new tab Prior lineage-tracing experiments demonstrated that the CPCs are among the first tier of somatic cells surrounding the hub (Gonczy and DiNardo, 1996Gonczy P. DiNardo S. The germ line regulates somatic cyst cell proliferation and fate during Drosophila spermatogenesis.Development. 1996; 122: 2437-2447PubMed Google Scholar). We found that Zfh-1 accumulated to high levels in these cells (Figure 1C, green), as shown by double staining with Traffic jam (Tj), a pansomatic cell marker (Li et al., 2003Li M.A. Alls J.D. Avancini R.M. Koo K. Godt D. The large Maf factor Traffic Jam controls gonad morphogenesis in Drosophila.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 994-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In newly formed cyst cell daughters, that is, those associated with a gonialblast, Zfh-1 levels decayed to about half that observed in CPCs (Figure 1C′, arrows; Table S1). In older cyst cells, those associated with TA spermatogonia, Zfh-1 levels dropped to 4- to 5-fold below that in CPCs (Figure 1C′, arrowheads; Table S1). The enriched expression of Zfh-1 in CPCs and its decay in daughter cells that move away from the influence of Upd is consistent with Zfh-1 being a genetic target of STAT activation in CPCs. We indeed found that persistent STAT activation led to accumulation of high levels of Zfh-1 in all somatic cells (Figure 1D; see also Figure 6D). However, Zfh-1 decreased only modestly upon STAT inactivation; thus, there may also be other inputs to Zfh-1 expression (see the Supplemental Data). We tested whether zfh-1 is required in CPCs by generating zfh-1 mutant clones, counting the proportion of testes with at least one remaining mutant stem cell 2, 4, and 8 days later. We found that zfh-1 mutant CPCs were recovered at negligible levels compared to control clones by even 2 days after clone induction (Table 1). zfh-1 mutant clones were recovered efficiently in GSCs, where zfh-1 is not expressed, at each time point (Table 1). Thus, zfh-1 is required in CPCs. In order to determine the fate of zfh-1 mutant CPCs, we examined testes 1 day after clone induction, since most zfh-1 mutant CPCs were lost by 2 days. We directly identified mutant CPCs by loss of Zfh-1 protein expression (Figure 1E, arrow). As expected, in control testes, all CPCs expressed Zfh-1 (0/10 testes had a Zfh-1-negative CPC). In contrast, experimental testes frequently exhibited one or more CPCs that were Zfh-1-negative (12/24 testes). To test whether the zfh-1 mutant CPCs failed to self-renew and instead underwent differentiation, we examined expression of the differentiation gene eyes absent (eya). Eya is normally undetectable in CPCs or their immediate daughter cyst cells associated with gonialblasts (Figure 1F, arrowheads). Eya accumulates at low levels in cyst cells accompanying groups of TA spermatogonia (Figure 1F, arrows) and at high levels in cyst cells accompanying spermatocytes (data not shown) (Fabrizio et al., 2003Fabrizio J.J. Boyle M. DiNardo S. A somatic role for eyes absent (eya) and sine oculis (so) in Drosophila spermatocyte development.Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We identified mutant CPCs among first-tier Tj-positive somatic cells by lack of Zfh-1 accumulation (Figure 1G, arrows). Most of such cells (15/18 scored) now precociously expressed low levels of Eya (Figure 1G, arrows; Figure 1G′ shows Eya only), while all other nonmutant (Zfh-1-expressing) CPCs exhibited negligible Eya accumulation (Figures 1G and 1G′, arrowheads). This indicated that zfh-1 loss in a CPC caused the stem cell to initiate its differentiation program; thus, zfh-1 is required for CPC self-renewal. While zfh-1 mutant CPCs clearly start differentiating, we do not know their eventual fate (see the Supplemental Data for additional analysis and discussion). We observed that Zfh-1 protein accumulation decreased in the cyst cell daughter of the CPC (Figure 1C). Since zfh-1-deficient CPCs differentiated, we wondered whether the natural decay of Zfh-1 from daughter cyst cells was essential for their differentiation. To test this, we used the GAL4 UAS system to artificially maintain zfh-1 expression, employing the cyst cell driver EyaA3 GAL4. This driver contains an eya regulatory element that causes GAL4 to be expressed precociously compared to normal eya gene expression. It drives low levels of expression in CPCs (Figure 2A, arrowheads) and high levels of expression in cyst cells (Figure 2A, arrows). To circumvent the lethality observed due to Zfh-1 misexpression in other tissues earlier in development, we restricted GAL4 induction to adults by including a temperature-sensitive allele of GAL80, the GAL4 inhibitor (McGuire et al., 2004McGuire S.E. Mao Z. Davis R.L. Spatiotemporal gene expression targeting with the TARGET and gene-switch systems in Drosophila.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: pl6Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Thus, only when adults were upshifted would Zfh-1 expression be sustained in CPC daughters. Normally, histologically undifferentiated cells are restricted to the apex of the testis; these cells fluoresce brightly with DNA stains (Figure 2B, bracket). By contrast, after 10 or more days of sustained zfh-1 expression, the entire testes became filled with undifferentiated cells (Figure 2C), many of which were Tj-positive somatic cells (Figure 2D, green). Surprisingly, Vasa staining revealed that excess small, early-stage germ cells were usually intermingled with the excess somatic cells (Figure 2D, red). The excess germ cells were primarily found together in pairs, although individual cells and larger groupings of spermatogonia were also present. Occasionally, excess somatic cells accumulated without accompanying germ cells (data not shown). No phenotype was observed upon zfh-1 misexpression in germ cells (data not shown), but we did observe a similar phenotype using a second cyst cell driver, c784 (data not shown) (Hrdlicka et al., 2002Hrdlicka L. Gibson M. Kiger A. Micchelli C. Schober M. Schock F. Perrimon N. Analysis of twenty-four Gal4 lines in Drosophila melanogaster.Genesis. 2002; 34: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Zfh-1 and its vertebrate homologs act as active repressors, inhibiting transcription by recruiting the corepressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) (Postigo and Dean, 1999Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. ZEB represses transcription through interaction with the corepressor CtBP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether repression was key in generating this gain-of-function phenotype. To test this, we expressed a form of zfh-1 in cyst cells in which the CtBP binding site was mutated (PLDLS > ASASA) to abrogate interaction between CtBP and Zfh-1 (Postigo and Dean, 1999Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. ZEB represses transcription through interaction with the corepressor CtBP.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We found that this mutant could not induce accumulation of excess early-stage cells (Figure 2E), even though the protein was stably expressed in cyst cell nuclei (Figure 2F, arrows). In these testes, the cyst cell differentiation marker Eya was expressed normally (data not shown). Therefore, sustained Zfh-1 exerts its effects by transcriptional repression, likely utilizing the corepressor CtBP. Of note, we also found that CtBP was required for maintenance of CPCs, as CtBP mutant CPC clones were not recovered (Table 1). This is consistent with an essential role for repression by Zfh-1/CtBP in maintaining CPC fate, though we cannot rule out the possibility that CtBP is required independently of Zfh-1. Accumulation of excess somatic cells suggested that sustained zfh-1 prevented differentiation into a cyst cell. To test this, we examined expression of the somatic differentiation gene eya (Fabrizio et al., 2003Fabrizio J.J. Boyle M. DiNardo S. A somatic role for eyes absent (eya) and sine oculis (so) in Drosophila spermatocyte development.Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In testes with sustained zfh-1 expression, most excess somatic cells had low or negligible Eya accumulation (Figures 3A, 3A′, 3B, and 3B′, arrowheads show Tj-positive, Eya-negative cells), suggesting that zfh-1 prevented somatic differentiation. Consistent with this, Wingless (Wg) protein, which accumulates to a significant degree only in CPCs and early cyst cells near the hub (Figure 3C), accumulated to high levels in cells with sustained Zfh-1 (Figure 3D; Figure 3D′ shows Wg only). Finally, in wild-type testes, only the CPCs undergo mitosis; daughter cyst cells, upon their birth, immediately withdraw from the cell cycle. In testes expressing sustained zfh-1, we found many examples of dividing somatic cells, even far from the hub (Figure 3E, arrows), suggesting that the excess somatic cells also retained this stem cell characteristic. Thus, sustained zfh-1 prevented differentiation of most somatic cells into mature cyst cells, and these cells retained stem cell characteristics. Taken together, these data suggest that zfh-1 is required to maintain CPCs, and its decay is also essential to promote lineage differentiation. In this experiment, even though zfh-1 expression was being driven in cyst cells, occasional cyst cells showed little Zfh-1 accumulation (data not shown). These cells were invariably Eya+ and associated with TA spermatogonia (Figure 3A′, arrows; Figure 3B′ shows costain with Bam to mark TA spermatogonia, arrows show Eya-positive cells). We speculate this could be due to active degradation of Zfh-1 mRNA or protein initiated by the cyst cell differentiation program. Consistent with this possibility, mammalian zfhx1b was recently shown to be under control of the miR-200 family of microRNAs (Christoffersen et al., 2007Christoffersen N.R. Silahtaroglu A. Orom U.A. Kauppinen S. Lund A.H. miR-200b mediates post-transcriptional repression of ZFHX1B.RNA. 2007; 13: 1172-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The nonautonomous effect of somatically-sustained Zfh-1 on germline cells was striking. It is known that defects in germline encystment can lead to proliferation of early-stage germ cells (Sarkar et al., 2007Sarkar A. Parikh N. Hearn S.A. Fuller M.T. Tazuke S.I. Schulz C.

Signaling from germ cells mediated by the rhomboid homolog stet organizes encapsulation by somatic support cells.Development. 2002; 129: 4523-4534PubMed Google Scholar). This is not the case here, as the germ cells were intermingled with somatic cells, and E-Cadherin distribution, which normally accumulates on somatic membranes (Figure 4A) (Tazuke et al., 2002Tazuke S.I. Schulz C. Gilboa L. Fogarty M. Mahowald A.P. Guichet A. Ephrussi A. Wood C.G. Lehmann R. Fuller M.T. A germline-specific gap junction protein required for survival of differentiating early germ cells.Development. 2002; 129: 2529-2539PubMed Google Scholar), showed that somatic extensions did encyst individual or pairs of germ cells (Figure 4B). To establish the identity of these germ cells, we first tested whether they differentiated normally by examining expression of Bam, a gene necessary and sufficient for germline differentiation (Gonczy et al., 1997Gonczy P.

Bam is normally repressed in GSCs and gonialblasts and is induced at the two- to four-cell spermatogonial stage (Figure 4C) (Brawley and Matunis, 2004Brawley C. Matunis E.

In testes with sustained zfh-1 expression, we did observe germ cell groupings that expressed a Bam-GFP reporter (Figure 4D), suggesting some germ cells differentiated. However, many germ cells, including individual and pairs of germ cells, did not express the reporter (Figure 4D). Therefore, sustained somatic zfh-1 expression nonautonomously inhibited germ cell differentiation. Given this, we used three independent assays to determine whether the germ cells retained stem cell character. First, we examined the expression of the M5-4 lacZ enhancer trap, which is expressed in GSCs and gonialblasts and occasionally in two cell cysts (Figure 4E) (Gonczy and DiNardo, 1996Gonczy P. DiNardo S. The germ line regulates somatic cyst cell proliferation and fate during Drosophila spermatogenesis.Development. 1996; 122: 2437-2447PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the germ cells in testes with sustained zfh-1 expression were positive for M5-4 lacZ (Figure 4F). Second, most germ cells cycled as single cells in locations far removed from the hub, as shown by the M-phase marker phospho-histone H3 (Figure 4G, arrows). This is consistent with GSC or gonialblast identity and inconsistent with TA spermatogonia, in which germ cells undergo mitosis synchronously. Finally, we examined the appearance of the fusome by adducin staining. In normal testes, the fusome appears spherical in GSCs and gonialblasts and becomes branched in larger cysts of spermatogonia (data not shown). We found that the zfh-1-induced excess pairs of germ cells typically shared a spherical fusome between them (Figure 4H, arrows), again consistent with GSC or gonialblast identity. Such germ cell pairs are similar to GSC-gonialblast pairs, which normally remain associated for an extended period due to a delay in cytokinesis (Hardy et al., 1979Hardy R.W. Tokuyasu K.T. Lindsley D.L. Garavito M. The germinal proliferation center in the testis of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1979; 69: 180-"

In this study, we investigated whether coculture with monolayers of cells derived from mouse AGM and fetal liver, or with stromal cell lines derived from these tissues, can enhance hESC hematopoietic differentiation. We found that under such conditions hESC-derived differentiating cells formed early hematopoietic progenitors, with a peak at day 18–21 of differentiation that corresponded to the highest CD34 expression. These hESC-derived hematopoietic cells were capable of primary and secondary hematopoietic engraftment into immunocompromised mice at substantially higher levels than described previously. Transcriptional and functional analysis identified TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 as positive enhancers of hESC hematopoietic differentiation that can further stimulate this process when added to the culture.

Overall, our findings represent significant progress toward the goal of deriving functional hematopoietic stem cells from hESCs. Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in leukemia treatment requires high-quality sources of tissue-matched bone marrow, mobilized peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. Suitable bone marrow is often in short supply, and cord blood, although bankable, contains much lower numbers of HSCs, which makes it less suitable for adult transplantation. Directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward HSCs offers a potentially attractive alternative to these conventional sources. The recent reports of somatic cell reprogramming by means of induced pluripotency makes this approach an even more exciting prospect for future cell-based therapies (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

Embryoid body (EB)-induced differentiation of hESCs can result in hematopoietic colony-forming cells (CFCs), and this can be further enhanced by BMP4 and a cocktail of cytokines, which is used for the expansion of bone marrow progenitor cells (Kennedy et al., 2007Kennedy M. D'Souza S.L. Lynch-Kattman M. Schwantz S. Keller G.

Furthermore, it has been shown that hematopoiesis from hESC may arise from primitive endothelial-like cells that express PECAM-1, FLK-1 (KDR), and VE-Cadherin, suggesting the existence of an embryonic endothelium that possess hemagioblastic characteristics (Wang et al., 2004Wang L. Shojaei F. Levac K. Cerdan C. Menendez P. Martin T. Rouleau A. Bhatia M.

Coculture of hESC with stromal cell lines such as S17 (Kaufman et al., 2001Kaufman D.S. Hanson E.T. Lewis R.L. Auerbach R. Thomson J.A.

Hematol. 2005; 33: 1450-1458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) can also result in spontaneous generation of hematopoietic cells; however, the overall extent of hematopoietic development is low (0.1%–2% of CD45+ during 8–20 days of differentiation). This is also reflected in vivo, where hESC-derived progenitors from coculture with S17 stromal cells engraft primary and secondary fetal sheep recipients with very low levels of chimerism (0.001%–0.05% of the bone marrow; Narayan et al., 2006Narayan A.D. Chase J.L. Lewis R.L. Tian X. Kaufman D.S. Thomson J.A. Zanjani E.D. Human embryonic stem cell derived hematopoietic cells are capable of engrafting primary as well as secondary fetal sheep recipients.Blood. 2006; 107: 2180-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The importance of embryonically derived HSCs has been thoroughly investigated in the murine embryo, showing that the first cells with long-term multilineage repopulation capacity that colonize the fetal liver and the bone marrow from day 10 of gestation arise in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, which comprises the splachnopleural mesoderm from the lower trunk and caudal region of the embryo (Medvinsky and Dzierzak, 1996Medvinsky A.

Culturing of the whole AGM region at an air/liquid interface results in a 15-fold increase in the number of HSCs, consistent with the hypothesis that this region produces factor(s) involved in the genesis, maintenance, and/or amplification of these cells (Medvinsky and Dzierzak, 1996Medvinsky A. Dzierzak E. Definitive hematopoiesis is autonomously initiated by the AGM region.Cell. 1996; 86: 897-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). The work conducted in one of our groups indicates that coculture of murine ESC with primary AGM tissue in whole-organ culture and with a stromal cell line derived from that tissue results in enhanced hematopoietic differentiation (Krassowska et al., 2006Krassowska A. Gordon-Keylock S. Samuel K. Gilchrist D. Dzierzak E. Oostendorp R.A.J. Forrester L.M. Ansell J.D. Haematopoetic activity in differentiating embryonic stem cells is enhanced by the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region.Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3595-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We show in this study that primary stromal cells derived from the AGM and fetal liver significantly enhance spontaneous hematopoietic differentiation in high-density hESC monolayer cell cultures. The hESC-derived hematopoietic cells were capable of primary and secondary hematopoietic engraftment into immunocompromised NOD/LtSz-Scid IL2Rγnull recipients with up to 16% engraftment, which is significantly higher than described previously. Large-scale transcriptional analysis combined with signal blocking and overexpression experiments led to identification of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 as positive regulators of hESC differentiation in this system. One stromal cell line generated from the aorta/mesenchyme part of the AGM region of 10 dpc murine embryos (AM20.1B4), one from the urogenital ridge of the AGM region (UG26.1B6), and one from the fetal liver (EL08.1D2) of 11 dpc embryos were used in this study (Oostendorp et al., 2002aOostendorp R.A.J.

We also investigated whether the primary stromal cells derived from the AGM (10.5 dpc) and fetal liver (12.5 dpc) region can enhance the hematopoietic differentiation of hESCs over a 25 day time period. For direct comparison, the experiments between stromal cell lines and primary cells were carried out in parallel and using the same early passage (35–50) hESCs. The stromal cells were mitotically inactivated and used in coculture experiments with hESCs over a 25 day differentiation time course monitored by flow cytometry and CFC assays. Pilot experiments with GFP-labeled hESCs cocultured with mitotically inactivated stromal cells and mitotically active stromal cells were carried out beforehand. This revealed no significant differences in the hematopoietic induction of hESC (data not shown); hence, mitotically inactivated stromal cells were used throughout this study. From day 12 to day 21, tight cobblestone patterns of cells appeared,and from day 18 onward differentiated cell types organized in “endothelial vessel” structures emerged (see Figures S1A and S1B, available online). Differentiation of hESC was confirmed by the downregulation of two pluripotency markers, OCT4 and NANOG (Figure S1C). CD34+ cells appeared at day 6 of culture and peaked on day 18 in all cases except when cocultured with the AM20.1B4 cell line (Figure 1A). The peak of CD34 expression corresponded to the maximum number of CFCs obtained (see below, Figure 2A). CD45+ cells appeared in small percentages in early stromal cell cocultures (from day 6, Figure 1B) and peaked by day 25; this occurs slightly later than in the cocultures with the primary stromal cell lines derived from the AGM region and fetal liver (Figure 1B). A small number of CD45+ cells were also identified in the control experiments in which hESCs differentiated in the absence of stromal feeder cells; however, this is most likely due to formation of a small number of EB structures resulting from the high culture density, especially at the later time points (our own observations). CD31+ cells first appeared on day 6 and peaked on day 12 in the stromal cell line cultures and on day 18 in the primary stromal cell cocultures (Figure 1C); however, the vast majority of them were CD34+CD31+ at these time points (Figures 1C and 1D). KDR/VEGFR2 shows a biphasic expression pattern in the stromal cell line cultures (Figure 1E): an early expression peak between days 6 and 12 associated with CD34 expression and a later peak between days 18 and 21, not associated with CD34 expression (Figure 1F). This pattern is not observed in the primary stromal cell cocultures in which the peak of KDR expression at day 18 seems to correspond with that of CD34+KDR+ (Figures 1E and 1F).Figure 2Hematopoietic Progenitor Capacity of hESCs Differentiating on Stromal CellsShow full caption(A) CFC activity of hESC differentiating on stromal cells as compared to no-feeder control (n = 4–8), error bars represent SD.

Using four-color flow cytometry analysis, we showed that 33.7% and 50.5% of CD34+KDR+ cells obtained from coculture of hESC with AGM or fetal liver primary cells, respectively (Figure S1D) were also CD31+VE-Cadherin+ consistent with the presence of hemangioblast-like cells suggested by Wang et al., 2004Wang L.

A smaller percentage of such cells were also found in the cocultures with the stromal cell lines (Figure S1E). Hematopoietic CFC activity peaked at day 18 in all cases except coculture with the AM20.1B4 cell line concurrent with the peak of most hematopoietic markers described above (Figures 2A and 1A). A relatively low CFC activity was noticeable in the control group differentiated in the absence of any stromal cells by the end of differentiation process (days 21–25, Figure 2A), though this was significantly less than during coculture with the stromal cell lines and might be explained by the formation of EB-like structures with low hematopoietic activity within dense cocultures. As observed with murine ESC differentiation (Krassowska et al., 2006Krassowska A. Gordon-Keylock S. Samuel K. Gilchrist D. Dzierzak E. Oostendorp R.A.J. Forrester L.M. Ansell J.D. Haematopoetic activity in differentiating embryonic stem cells is enhanced by the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region.Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 3595-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), coculture with stromal cells derived from primary AGM and FL regions resulted in a significant increase in hematopoietic activity when compared to a no-feeder control group. Representative colonies from the differentiation of hESCs showed typical morphology of various CFC subtypes, including macrophages, granulocytes, and erythrocytes as well as mixed colonies comprising different types of these cells (Figure 2B). Colony identity was confirmed by Wright-Giemsa staining of cytospin preparations (Figure 2C). Analysis of CFCs from coculture with the stromal cell lines indicated a gradual decline in BFU-E and CFU-E from day 6 in all three coculture systems (hESC-AM20.1B4, hESC-EL08.1D2, and hESC-UG26.1B6, Figure 2D). Cells within the CFU-G, CFU-M, and CFU-GM colonies were analyzed by flow cytometry and found to be CD45+ and coexpressing at least one of the following markers (CD64, CD33, and CD14), indicating early myeloid or granulocytic lineage commitment (Figures S2A–S2C). Erythroid cells were detected in mixed colonies by their hemoglobinization, glycophorin A expression, and the absence of CD45 expression (Figure S2D). To prove these colonies were of human origin, DNA fingerprinting analysis was carried out on the hESCs and colonies recovered from methylcellulose assays (Figure S2E). This analysis, in addition to the complete absence of colonies arising from mitotically inactivated primary cells derived from the AGM region, fetal liver, or stromal cell lines, confirmed the human origin of hematopoietic colonies. Another observation was the presence of cells that lacked CD34 and CD45 expression but showed expression of some typical MSC markers during coculture with each of the three stromal cell lines as shown in Figure S3. To investigate in detail the hematopoietic differentiation of hESC on immortalized stromal cells, we carried out quantitative RT-PCR analysis for various genes that mark the development of mesoderm, and differentiation into hematopoietic precursors or more committed definitive hematopoietic cells. DNA sequences of oligonucleotides used in all PCR reactions were designed to amplify only the human ortholog. We found that expression of two mesodermal markers, BRACHYURY and MIXL1, was activated in the first 6 days of coculture, indicating formation of mesodermal cells preceding the emergence of early CD34+CD31+KDR+CD45− precursors on day 12 (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the strongest activation of both genes occurred during coculture of hESC with the AM20.1B4 cell line, which also shows a later peak in CD34+ expression and CFC formation (Figures 2C and 3A). This suggests that AM20.1B4 is slightly more efficient in encouraging hESCs to form mesoderm and perhaps less-differentiated hematopoietic progenitor cells. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that three important genes involved in early hematopoiesis in mice, SCL (Figure 3B) GATA2, and LMO2 (data not shown), show the strongest upregulation during coculture with the AM20.1B4 cell line. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis for hemangioblast-related markers KDR and CD31 (PECAM1) showed the strongest upregulation during coculture with the UG26.1B6 and EL08.1D2 cell lines at the early time points comprising days 6–18 (Figure 3B), which also correlates with the maximal CFC activity observed with these stromal cell lines (Figure 2A). Interestingly, CDX4 activation was obvious on day 6 in the EL08.1D2 and UG26.1B6 cocultures followed by strong upregulation of HOXB4 from day 12 onward (Figure 3B), suggesting the onset of definitive hematopoiesis in these two cocultures. Additionally, the expression of RUNX1/AML and PU.1 that is important for definitive hematopoietic cell differentiation was best upregulated in the UG26.1B6 coculture on day 18, which correlates with peak CFC activity and CD34 expression in these cocultures (Figure 3B). Erythroid-like cells derived from hESCs coexpress high levels of embryonic and fetal globins but little or no adult globins (Chang et al., 2006Chang K.H. Nelson A.M. Cao H. Wang L. Nakamoto B. Ware C.B. Papayannopoulou T. Definitive-like erythroid cells derived from human embryonic stem cells co-express high levels of embryonic and fetal globins with little or no adult globin.Blood. 2006; 108: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This necessitates the investigation of different globin expression in erythroid cells obtained after CFC assays. The specificity of each primer pair was investigated by using human bone marrow and cDNA from an early human embryo as positive controls; therefore, the lack of any PCR product in the cells obtained from CFU-E/BFU-E would indicate lack in expression rather than failure in the PCR procedure. It is well known that coordinated switching of the α-like and β-like genes results in the expression of embryonic Hb Gower-1(ζ2ɛ2), fetal Hb-F (α2γ2), and adult Hb-A (α2β2). Additionally, there are other structurally defined hemoglobins such as Gower-2 (α2ɛ2), Portland-1 (ζ2γ2), and Portland-2 (ζ2β2), which are expressed at low levels in primitive and definitive erythroid cells primarily during fetal and embryonic development. Expression analysis of these possible globin combinations in CFU-E colonies indicated that erythroid progenitors generated in the first 12 days of differentiation are likely to express Gower-1, fetal Hb-F, and Portland-1 (Figure 3C); however, from day 12 onward, only the Gower-2 form can be produced. The same analysis on CFU-Es taken from different days of differentiation showed a reduction in the expression of ζ2 and γ2 chains and therefore little expression of the embryonic Gower-1, Portland-1, and Hb-F, which suggests that Gower-2 was the predominant combination in the first 18 days, while fetal Hb-F and Gower-2 were coexpressed from day 18 onward (Figure 3C). To understand the nature of the induction events, we separated the two cell types using transwell inserts. Flow cytometry analysis showed large reductions in hematoendothelial cell surface marker expression (data not shown). Interestingly, the total number of CFCs was significantly reduced when transwell inserts were used in combination with UG26.1B6 and EL08.1D2 cell lines (Figure 4A), due to the complete absence of CFU-E and BFU-E and significant reduction in other CFC types in both cell lines. In contrast, the conditioned medium from the AM20.1B4 cell line resulted in the maintenance of CFC activity with the majority of colonies being of the CFU-M type (Figure 4A). A significant reduction in hematopoietic cell surface marker expression and lack of CFC activity was also noted when transwell inserts were used during the coculture of hESC with primary stromal cells derived from 10.5 dpc AGM and 12.5 dpc fetal liver region, with CFCs from these experiments giving rise only to very few CFU-M on day 12, resulting in 98% loss of hematopoietic CFC activity (data not shown). To investigate whether the extracellular matrix (ECM) extracted from the stromal cell lines retains their hematopoietic inducing activities, we isolated the pericellular matrix from the cells using deoxycholate and cultured hESC on this matrix for 18 days in the presence of FCS-containing media (ECM+FCS medium, Figures 4B–4D). In all three cases, CFC capability declined; however, there were large variances between the cell lines with AM20.1B4 retaining 30% of the CFC activity, while EL08.1D2 and UG26.1B6 retained only 2% and 7%, respectively (Figures 4B–4D). When the FCS-containing medium was conditioned by the cells and combined with ECM, hematopoietic activity was lost for UG26.1B6 and EL08.1D2 (Figures 4C and 4D). In the case of AM20.1B4, we noticed more terminal differentiation (only CFU-M was observed instead of CFU-G, M, and CFU-GM) for FCS-conditioned medium combined with the ECM of this cell line, which again correlates with the transwell data showing that CFU-M was the predominant colony type formed (Figure 4B). To better define the culture conditions for hematopoietic differentiation of hESCs, we cultured these cells on ECM derived from each of the cell lines in serum-free medium (stem line, Sigma) supplemented with three human cytokines (SCF, TPO, FLT-3L) or five human cytokines (BMP4, SCF, FLT-3L, TPO, and VEGF-A165) as described by Tian et al., 2004Tian X.

Addition of the three cytokines to the serum-free medium in combination with the ECM derived from the stromal cell lines resulted in complete abrogation of the hematopoietic activity in the AM20.1B4 cell line and retention of only 36% and 6.4% of this activity in the EL08.1D2 and UG26.1B6 cell lines, respectively (Figures 4C and 4D). Supplementation of the serum-free media with five cytokines and combination with ECM abolished hematopoietic CFC activity of all three stromal cell lines (Figures 4B–4D), corroborating previous data by Tian et al., 2004Tian X.

Similar experiments carried out with ECM extracted from primary AGM or FL stromal cells showed a total loss of hematopoietic CFC activity, indicating that direct cell-to-cell contact was crucial for ESC differentiation on primary stromal cells. To better define the molecular mechanisms modulating the hematopoietic differentiation of hESC cocultured with stromal cells, potential hematopoietic signaling pathways were modulated. Gene expression analyses from macroarray (Oostendorp et al., 2005bOostendorp R.A.J. Robin C. Steinhoff C. Marz S. Brauer R. Nuber U.A. Dzierzak E.A. Peschel C. Long-term maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells does not require contact with embryo-derived stromal cells in co-cultures.Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 842-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and microarray data (Figure S4) of the three murine stromal cell lines used in this study as well as a number of documented hematopoietic regulators (VEGFR2, SDF1, IL6, M-CSF, TPO, and GM-CSF) were taken together to produce a list of candidates, which might mediate hematopoietic induction. Cocultures with UG26.1B6 were used for these experiments, since these produced the highest number of CD45+ cells when compared to the other two stromal cell lines (Figure 1B). Chemical or antibody inhibitors for these factors were added to the differentiation media for 18 days at optimal inhibitory concentrations (Table S1). Since the expression of CD45 closely correlated to the CFC activity, flow cytometry analysis for this marker was used to identify possible effects on the hematopoietic differentiation of hESCs. Several of the identified candidates including members of the FGF family (FGF 7 and 9), members of the IGF family (IGF2), and IGF binding proteins (IGFBP3 and 4), cytokines (IL6, IL3, IL1, M-CSF, GM-CSF, TNFα), chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, SDF1), and in particular candidates linked to the TGF-β superfamily of signaling factors (TGF-β1–3, Activin, BMP4, and BMP2) modulate the induction of CD45+ cells from hESC. Both stimulating and inhibitory activities were found with the TGF-β family members. Inhibition of the Activin receptor 1b (ALK4), TGF-β receptor 1 (ALK5), and Nodal receptor 1 (ALK7) by ALK 4-5-7 resulted in the most significant changes in cell morphology (data not shown) and decrease of hematopoietic marker expression during differentiation, whereas inhibition of BMP4 alone, BMP4 and BMP2 together (via Gremlin), Activin receptor type 1b (ALK4), and TGF-β2 via binding of TGF-β soluble receptor III (betaglycan) resulted in a significant increase in CD45 expression (Table S1), suggesting that these later factors were unlikely to account for the significant decrease in hematopoietic commitment observed upon application of ALK 4-5-7. Instead, inhibition of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 alone resulted in a significant decrease in CD45 expression (Table S1). To investigate the role of some of the TGF-β family members in more detail, we added to our coculture system human soluble TGF-β1, -2, and -3, BMP4 (Figure 5A), and Activin A (data not shown) in a dose-dependent manner. This showed that both TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 enhance hematopoietic differentiation of hESC cocultured with the UG26.1B6 cell line most effectively at different concentrations (TGF-β1, 20 ng/ml; TGF-β3, 20–80 ng/ml; Figure 5A). In contrast, TGF-β2 (20–100 ng/ml), BMP4 (20 ng/ml; Figure 5A), and Activin A (1–30 ng/ml; data not shown) reduced CD45 expression, pointing to a negative role for these factors in hematopoietic commitment of hESCs in this coculture system when added for the whole length of differentiation period (Figure 5A). Addition of soluble human TGF-β1 or TGF-β3 to differentiating hESCs cocultured in the presence or absence of the other stromal cell lines or primary cells indicated a significant increase in hematopoietic commitment of hESCs (Figure 5B), suggesting that addition of these two growth factors is beneficial to their differentiation. Expression analysis of a number of TGF and BMP family members, receptors, and modulators (Figure S4) indicated that Tgfβ1 is"

Here, we describe an ex vivo model that facilitates a rapid and robust emergence of multipotent long-term repopulating HSCs in the embryonic AGM region. Because this method includes a cell dissociation step prior to reconstruction of a three-dimensional functional tissue and preserves both stromal and hematopoietic elements, it allowed us to identify the direct ancestry of the rapidly expanding HSC pool. We demonstrate that extensive generation of definitive HSCs in the AGM occurs predominantly through the acquisition of stem characteristics by the VE-cadherin+CD45+ population."

In the current study, we performed a functional screen in ESCs to identify Wnt-dependent transcription factors that could induce Wnt-independent development of mesoderm-derived lineages. Mesp1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is transiently expressed by the earliest progenitors of the cardiovascular system from E6.5 to E7.5 (Saga et al., 2000Saga Y. Kitajima S. Miyagawa-Tomita S. Mesp1 Expression Is the Earliest Sign of Cardiovascular Development.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 345-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Lineage tracing studies show that virtually all cells of the heart and cells of the vascular system derive from Mesp1-expressing precursors (Saga et al., 2000Saga Y. Kitajima S. Miyagawa-Tomita S. Mesp1 Expression Is the Earliest Sign of Cardiovascular Development.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 345-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). During gastrulation, progenitors of cardiogenic mesoderm arise at E6.5 in the posterior lateral epiblast and migrate to form the cardiac crescent at E7.5, when regionalized cell fates are first delineated (Meilhac et al., 2004Meilhac S.M.

Lineage tracing and heterotopic transplantation studies suggest that precursors in the earliest heart field possess potential to generate myocardium, endocardium, and epicardium, but subsequently become restricted as lineage-specific regulatory programs are activated (Kitajima et al., 2000Kitajima S. Takagi A. Inoue T. Saga Y. MesP1 and MesP2 are essential for the development of cardiac mesoderm.Development. 2000; 127: 3215-3226PubMed Google Scholar, Tam et al., 1997Tam P.P.L. Parameswaran M.

The mechanisms by which inductive signals in the primitive streak influence development of the cardiac progenitor field are incompletely understood (Kelly, 2005Kelly R.G. Molecular inroads into the anterior heart field.Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2005; 15: 51-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that Mesp1 induces features of EMT in differentiating ESCs and promotes development of mesoderm precursors of the cardiovascular lineage. The induction of EMT is likely a result of the ability of Mesp1 to induce Snai1, which we show can independently decrease E-Cadherin. Further, we show that transient expression of Mesp1 is sufficient to allow development of cardiovascular mesoderm, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cardiomyocytes, while inhibiting development of other mesodermal lineages, correlating with changes in global gene expression induced by Mesp1. Finally, Mesp1 induces maximal cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) expression with inhibition of Wnt signaling, corresponding with the inhibition of cardiac development by Wnt signaling at later stages in vivo (Schneider and Mercola, 2001Schneider V.A. Mercola M. Wnt antagonism initiates cardiogenesis in Xenopus laevis.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, Ueno et al., 2007Ueno S. Weidinger G. Osugi T. Kohn A.D.

USA. 2007; 104: 9685-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Mesp1 is sufficient for triggering EMT and programming nascent mesoderm toward a restricted set of cardiovascular fates. We previously identified transcription factors whose expression during early ESC differentiation required Wnt signaling, many being associated with the primitive streak or mesoderm (Lindsley et al., 2006Lindsley R.C. Gill J.G. Kyba M. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Canonical Wnt signaling is required for development of embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm.Development. 2006; 133: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Among these were Brachyury (T), Mixl1, Evx1, Eomes, Mesp1, Cdx2, and Hand1. We hypothesized that some of these factors might induce mesoderm development independently of Wnt activity. To test this, we generated ESC lines with doxycycline (dox)-inducible expression of each candidate. We analyzed PDGFRα and Flk1 expression (Sakurai et al., 2006Sakurai H. Era T. Jakt L.M. Okada M. Nakai S. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S. In vitro modeling of paraxial and lateral mesoderm differentiation reveals early reversibility.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 575-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, Tada et al., 2005Tada S.

Of the candidates tested, Mesp1 most markedly increased the frequency of PDGFRα+ and Flk1+ cells. After 2 days of Mesp1 expression, only 4% of cells failed to express Flk1 or PDGFRα, whereas the majority of cells were PDGFRα− Flk1− for all other candidates. Thus, Mesp1 robustly induces early mesoderm markers independently of Wnt signaling. During ESC differentiation, endogenous Mesp1 mRNA was detected on day 2.5, was maximal on days 3 to 3.5, and was nearly extinguished by day 4.5 (Figure S1A). We generated an A2lox ESC line with inducible V5-epitope-tagged Mesp1 (Figure S1C). Upon differentiation, V5-Mesp1 protein was not detected unless cells were treated with dox. After dox addition on day 2 and medium replacement on day 4, Mesp1 protein was detectable only on days 3 and 4, accurately reflecting the expression of endogenous Mesp1. In A2lox cells expressing either a Mesp1-GFP fusion protein or a bicistronic Mesp1-ires-GFP message (Figure S1E, upper panels), doxycycline induced uniform GFP expression in 88.2% and 95.6% of cells, respectively, indicating expression in all cells and at similar levels. Thus, we used these same conditions and timing of Mesp1 induction (i.e., adding dox from day 2 to 4) (Figure S1B) for the following studies. We analyzed Flk1 and PDGFRα expression in differentiating A2lox.Mesp1 cells at various times (Figure 1B; Table S4). In unmanipulated cultures, differentiating ESCs developed into Flk1−PDGFRα+ (13%), Flk1+PDGFRα+ (10%), and Flk1+PDGFRα− (4%) populations on day 4 of differentiation, which increased to 34%, 24% and 6% on day 5, respectively (Figure 1B, Table S4). None of these populations developed in the presence of DKK1 alone, consistent with a Wnt requirement by early mesoderm (Lindsley et al., 2006Lindsley R.C. Gill J.G. Kyba M. Murphy T.L. Murphy K.M. Canonical Wnt signaling is required for development of embryonic stem cell-derived mesoderm.Development. 2006; 133: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, Kelly et al., 2004Kelly O.G.

In the presence of DKK1, Mesp1 induced development of Flk1−PDGFRα+ cells to 77% after one day (Figure 1B, day 3), followed by an increase in Flk1 expression on days 4 and 5 (Figure 1B). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation was similar between untreated and dox-treated cultures for both the Flk1−PDGFRα+ and Flk1+PDGFRα+ populations (Figure S1D) and both the Flk1−PDGFRα+ and Flk1+PDGFRα+ populations expressed similar levels of Mesp1 (Figure S1E, lower panels). This suggests that these two populations do not result from variable proliferative responses to dox, but instead are induced sequentially after Mesp1 expression. Since Mesp1−/− embryos showed altered cell migration during gastrulation (Saga et al., 1999Saga Y. Miyagawa-Tomita S. Takagi A. Kitajima S. Miyazaki J. Inoue T. MesP1 is expressed in the heart precursor cells and required for the formation of a single heart tube.Development. 1999; 126: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested if Mesp1 might influence aspects of EMT, such as the switch from E-cadherin to N-cadherin expression (Peinado et al., 2004Peinado H.

Signaling networks guiding epithelial-mesenchymal transitions during embryogenesis and cancer progression.Cancer Sci. 2007; 98: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). On day 4, untreated differentiating ESCs show a typical heterogeneous pattern of nonoverlapping regions of E-cadherin or N-cadherin expression (Figure 2A). DKK1 treatment causes uniform maintenance of E-cadherin expression and loss of N-cadherin induction (Figure 2A). Mesp1 completely inhibited E-cadherin and uniformly induced N-cadherin expression, either with or without DKK1 treatment (Figure 2A). We next determined the changes in global gene expression induced by Mesp1 (Figure 2B). A2lox.Mesp1 ESCs were differentiated for 48 hr, were induced with dox both in the absence and presence of DKK1, and were analyzed 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, and 120 hr after dox addition (Table S1). In the presence of DKK1, Mesp1 inhibited expression of several epithelial genes, including claudin 3 (Cldn3), claudin 7 (Cldn7), occludin (Ocln), and E-cadherin (Cdh1) within 24 hr of induction (day 3), with further inhibition on day 4 (Figure 2B). At the same time, Mesp1 induced expression of many mesenchymal genes, including matrix metallopeptidase 2 (Mmp2), vimentin (Vim), N-cadherin (Cdh2), and fibronectin (Fn1). These results suggest Mesp1 induces a global transition from epithelial to mesenchymal gene expression. Next we examined transcription factors that regulate EMT, such as snail (Snai1) and twist (Twist) (Carver et al., 2001Carver E.A. Jiang R. Lan Y. Oram K.F. Gridley T. The Mouse Snail Gene Encodes a Key Regulator of the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8184-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, Thiery and Sleeman, 2006Thiery J.P. Sleeman J.P. Complex networks orchestrate epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (3060) Google Scholar). In the presence of DKK1, Mesp1 induced Snai1 and Twist expression within 24 hr (Figure 2B). Snai1 expression increased progressively from 5-fold induction at 6 hr to 39-fold induction after 24 hr of dox treatment (Figures 2C and 2D). To test if Snai1 could mediate Mesp1's actions, we generated a dox-inducible A2lox.Snai1 ESC line and examined E-cadherin repression by Snai1 or Mesp1 (Figure 2E). Both Mesp1 and Snai1 decreased E-cadherin expression, by 59% and 52% respectively. However, unlike Mesp1, Snai1 failed to induce Flk1+ or PDGFRα+ expression in DKK1-treated cultures (Figure 2F), suggesting that Snai1 can mediate some, but not all, of Mesp1's actions. To ask if Mesp1 is necessary for EMT or for Snai1 expression in ESCs, we used mice with Cre recombinase targeted to the Mesp1 locus (Mesp1Cre/+) (Saga et al., 1999Saga Y. Miyagawa-Tomita S. Takagi A. Kitajima S. Miyazaki J. Inoue T. MesP1 is expressed in the heart precursor cells and required for the formation of a single heart tube.Development. 1999; 126: 3437-3447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate ESCs that were Mesp1 heterozygous (Cre/+) or Mesp1 deficient (Cre/Cre) (Figure 2G). After 5 days of differentiation in unmanipulated cultures, Mesp1Cre/Cre cells retained endogenous Snai1 expression (Figure 2H), had downregulated E-cadherin, and upregulated N-cadherin, indicating an EMT similar to control Mesp1Cre/+cells (Figure 2I). Interestingly, the Mesp1Cre/Cre cells expressed a related family member Mesp2 at a slightly increased level compared to Mesp1Cre/+cells (Figure 2H). Since Mesp2 can compensate for migratory defects in Mesp1-deficient embryos (Kitajima et al., 2000Kitajima S. Takagi A. Inoue T. Saga Y. MesP1 and MesP2 are essential for the development of cardiac mesoderm.Development. 2000; 127: 3215-3226PubMed Google Scholar), we asked if Mesp2 can induce mesoderm and EMT in ESCs (Figure S2). Dox treatment of A2lox.Mesp2 cells induced expression of Flk1 and PDGFRα (Figure S2A), downregulated E-cadherin (Figure S2A), and induced Snai1 expression in DKK treated cultures (Figure S2B). Thus, the ability of differentiating Mesp1-deficient ESCs to express Snai1 and undergo EMT may be due to compensation by Mesp2. At 96 hr after induction of Mesp1, global microarray expression data identified four gene expression patterns roughly correlating with distinct cell lineages (Figure 3A; Table S1). One set of genes was inhibited by Mesp1 but was also inhibited by Wnt signaling (Figure 3A, NEURO). These genes were only expressed in the presence of DKK1, but then were inhibited by Mesp1 in this condition, and contained genes such as Sox2 and Pax6, which are associated with neuroectoderm, and Pax7, which is associated with neuroectoderm and paraxial mesoderm. This expression pattern observed by microarray was also confirmed by RT-PCR (Figure 3B). A second set of genes was inhibited by Mesp1 but required Wnt signaling for expression (Figure 3A, HEME). These genes were only expressed in the absence of DKK1, but then were inhibited by Mesp1 in this condition, and contained many genes that were associated with the hematopoietic lineage (D'Souza et al., 2005D'Souza S.L.

SCL/Tal-1 is essential for hematopoietic commitment of the hemangioblast but not for its development.Blood. 2005; 105: 3862-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), such as Tal1, Gata1, and Hbb-b1 (Figure 3C). A third set of genes was induced by Mesp1, but only during inhibition of Wnt signaling (Figure 3A, CARDIOMYOCYTE). These genes were only expressed in the presence of both DKK1 and Mesp1 and contained many genes that were cardiomyocyte specific, such as Myh6, Myh7, Myl2, Myl7, Tnnt2, and Nppa (Figure 3D) (Yuasa et al., 2005Yuasa S.

Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A fourth set of genes was induced by Mesp1, but their endogenous expression required Wnt signaling (Figure 3A, ENDOTHELIAL, SMC). These genes were inhibited by DKK1, but were induced by Mesp1 in this condition, and contained many genes associated with endothelial and smooth muscle cells (Lindskog et al., 2006Lindskog H.

These results are summarized in Figure 3G and are consistent with Mesp1 lineage tracing of cardiovascular cells in vivo (Saga et al., 2000Saga Y. Kitajima S. Miyagawa-Tomita S.

Mesp1 induced the paraxial mesoderm genes Pax3 and Tcf15 on day 4, but this was not sustained at day 6 (Figures S3A and S3B). Mesp1 failed to induce other paraxial mesoderm genes, such as Mesp2, Tbx6, or Pax1 (Sakurai et al., 2006Sakurai H. Era T. Jakt L.M. Okada M. Nakai S. Nishikawa S. Nishikawa S.

However, this could either be due to the inability of Mesp1 to induce paraxial genes or to a bias against paraxial gene expression in the culture conditions. We used FACS and immunohistochemistry for α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA, Acta2) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT, Tnnt2) to quantify commitment to cardiovascular lineages in response to Mesp1. αSMA is expressed by mesenchymal cells (Ball et al., 2007Ball S.G.

On day 6 of differentiation, untreated A2lox.Mesp1 ESCs contained a 4% population of cells expressing αSMA (Figure 4A, Table S5). Without DKK1 treatment, Mesp1 increased αSMA expression to 45% of cells (Figure 4A Table S5). cTnT was not expressed by untreated cultures, consistent with a report that embryoid bodies in suspension cultures do not efficiently differentiate into cardiomyocytes spontaneously (Ueno et al., 2007Ueno S. Weidinger G. Osugi T. Kohn A.D. Golob J.L. Pabon L. Reinecke H. Moon R.T. Murry C.E. Biphasic role for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cardiac specification in zebrafish and embryonic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 9685-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Mesp1 did not induce cTnT without DKK1 treatment. However, with DKK1, Mesp1 induced a population of αSMA+ cTnT+ cells, and in this condition, the majority of cell clusters were spontaneously contractile (Figure S5). We confirmed these results by fluorescence microscopy for αSMA, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), and cTnT expression (Figure 4B). On day 8, αSMA-expressing cells were present in untreated cultures, increased by Mesp1, and decreased by DKK1 treatment (Figure 4B). αSMA-expressing cells were also induced by Mesp1 in the presence of DKK1. Cultures with αSMA-expressing cells also contained a small number of SM-MHC-positive cells (Figure 4B). RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of SM-MHC (Myh11) and the smooth muscle marker SM22, which had similar expression patterns to that of SMA (acta2) (Figure S2D). cTnT was induced by Mesp1 in the presence of DKK1 and, again, largely colocalized with αSMA (Figure 4B). We examined the maturity of Mesp1-induced cells by measuring calcium fluxes and by voltage-clamp recording. The A7R5 vascular smooth muscle cells fluxed calcium in response to vasopressin and ionomycin, but not angiotensin, as described (Filipeanu et al., 2001Filipeanu C.M. Brailoiu E. Kok J.W. Henning R.H. De Zeeuw D. Nelemans S.A. Intracellular angiotensin II elicits Ca2+ increases in A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 420: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mesp1-induced ESCs fluxed calcium in response to ionomycin, but not vasopressin or angiotensin (Figure S4), suggesting that Mesp1-induced α-SMA+ cells represent immature smooth muscle cells at this time. We next compared whole-cell current and voltage-clamp recordings from cultures induced by Mesp1 in the presence of DKK1 to those from cultures treated with DKK1 only (Table S3). The mean resting membrane potential (Vm) measured in Mesp1-induced clusters was significantly more hyperpolarized than the mean Vm of cells treated with DKK1 alone (Table S3). Action potentials could be evoked in some beating clusters obtained by Mesp1 induction in the presence of DKK1 (Figure 4C) and were more readily evoked, larger in amplitude, and broader when outward K+ currents were blocked (Figure 4C, right panel) but were never observed in cells treated with DKK1 alone. Voltage-gated outward K+ currents (IK) and inwardly rectifying K+ currents (IK1) were recorded in all (n = 7) spontaneously beating clusters (Figure 4D). Although K+ currents were also detected in cells treated with DKK1 alone, mean IK and IK1 densities were significantly larger in clusters obtained by Mesp1 induction in the presence of DKK1 (Table S3). Voltage-gated inward currents were also evident in some recordings (n = 2) (Figures 4D and 4E, left panels), and inward Na+ (INa) and Ca2+ (ICa) currents (Figures 4D and 4E, right panels) could be measured only in Mesp1-induced cells (Table S3). These results show that spontaneously beating clusters induced by Mesp1 in the presence of DKK1 are electrically differentiated compared to cultures treated with DKK1 alone and are consistent with an early stage of differentiation into cardiomyocytes (Nerbonne and Kass, 2005Nerbonne J.M. Kass R.S. Molecular physiology of cardiac repolarization.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1205-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The selective cTnT expression induced by Mesp1 with DKK1 is consistent with known effects of Wnt signaling on cardiac development, in which Wnt signaling is required for early steps but is inhibitory at later stages of cardiac development (Ueno et al., 2007Ueno S. Weidinger G. Osugi T. Kohn A.D. Golob J.L. Pabon L. Reinecke H. Moon R.T. Murry C.E. Biphasic role for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cardiac specification in zebrafish and embryonic stem cells.Proc.

Because αSMA and cTnT expression did not account for all cells responding to Mesp1, we asked if endothelial markers were induced by Mesp1 (Figures 5A and 5B). Untreated cultures had abundant Pecam1+ cells (Figure 5A), consistent with a previous report (Yamashita et al., 2000Yamashita J. Itoh H. Hirashima M. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Yurugi T. Naito M. Nakao K.

Along with regulation of lysine biosynthetic genes, mutations within the lysine-responsive riboswitch (L-box) play a role in the acquisition of resistance to antimicrobial lysine analogs. To understand the structural basis for lysine binding, we have determined the 2.8 angstroms resolution crystal structure of lysine bound to the Thermotoga maritima asd lysine riboswitch ligand-binding domain. The structure reveals a complex architecture scaffolding a binding pocket completely enveloping lysine. Mutations conferring antimicrobial resistance cluster around this site as well as highly conserved long range interactions, indicating that they disrupt lysine binding or proper folding of the RNA. Comparison of the free and bound forms by x-ray crystallography, small angle x-ray scattering, and chemical probing reveals almost identical structures, indicating that lysine induces only limited and local conformational changes upon binding."
https://openalex.org/W2075317095,"The question of how a tissue grows to a certain size and knows when to stop remains a major mystery of biology. It is a phenomenon seen not only in body formation, but also in organs such as the liver when regeneration is allowed to occur. Many ideas have been proposed to explain how a tissue senses the limit of size, and few have been supported by experimental evidence. Jamie Verheyden and Xin Sun have discovered a new principle for control of organ size. In a study of the termination of signalling factors controlling growth and expansion in the mouse limb bud, a combination of mutations revealed an inhibitory loop whereby fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signalling represses Gremlin1 expression, these two factors being key positive signals in limb bud outgrowth. This inhibitory loop is triggered by a positive Fgf/Shh loop. This model differs from earlier published models, and may have implications far beyond limb development, for size control in other organs, in evolution, and in limb regeneration. A new principle for control of organ size is discovered by using the mouse limb bud to study how signals signalling growth and expansion are terminated. A combination of mutations were identified that revealed an inhibitory loop whereby FGF signalling represses Gremlin1, these two factors being key positive signals in limb bud outgrowth. This inhibitory loop is triggered by a positive FGF/Shh loop, and this model differs from earlier published models. During organ formation and regeneration a proper balance between promoting and restricting growth is critical to achieve stereotypical size. Limb bud outgrowth is driven by signals in a positive feedback loop involving fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) genes, sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Gremlin1 (Grem1)1. Precise termination of these signals is essential to restrict limb bud size2,3,4. The current model predicts a sequence of signal termination consistent with that in chick limb buds4. Our finding that the sequence in mouse limb buds is different led us to explore alternative mechanisms. Here we show, by analysing compound mouse mutants defective in genes comprising the positive loop, genetic evidence that FGF signalling can repress Grem1 expression, revealing a novel Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. This repression occurs both in mouse and chick limb buds, and is dependent on high FGF activity. These data support a mechanism where the positive Fgf/Shh loop drives outgrowth and an increase in FGF signalling, which triggers the Fgf/Grem1 inhibitory loop. The inhibitory loop then operates to terminate outgrowth signals in the order observed in either mouse or chick limb buds. Our study unveils the concept of a self-promoting and self-terminating circuit that may be used to attain proper tissue size in a broad spectrum of developmental and regenerative settings."
https://openalex.org/W2052841243,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease that leads to loss of motor function and early death. About 5% of cases are inherited, with the majority of identified linkages in the gene encoding copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Strong evidence indicates that the SOD1 mutations confer dominant toxicity on the protein. To provide new insight into mechanisms of ALS, we have generated and characterized a model for familial ALS in Drosophila with transgenic expression of human SOD1. Expression of wild type or disease-linked (A4V, G85R) mutants of human SOD1 selectively in motor neurons induced progressive climbing deficits. These effects were accompanied by defective neural circuit electrophysiology, focal accumulation of human SOD1 protein in motor neurons, and a stress response in surrounding glia. However, toxicity was not associated with oligomerization of SOD1 and did not lead to neuronal loss. These studies uncover cell-autonomous injury by SOD1 to motor neurons in vivo, as well as non-autonomous effects on glia, and provide the foundation for new insight into injury and protection of motor neurons in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2092562715,"Conditions of stress, such as myocardial infarction, stimulate up-regulation of heme oxygenase (HO-1) to provide cardioprotection. Here, we show that CO, a product of heme catabolism by HO-1, directly inhibits native rat cardiomyocyte L-type Ca2+ currents and the recombinant α1C subunit of the human cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel. CO (applied via a recognized CO donor molecule or as the dissolved gas) caused reversible, voltage-independent channel inhibition, which was dependent on the presence of a spliced insert in the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of the channel. Sequential molecular dissection and point mutagenesis identified three key cysteine residues within the proximal 31 amino acids of the splice insert required for CO sensitivity. CO-mediated inhibition was independent of nitric oxide and protein kinase G but was prevented by antioxidants and the reducing agent, dithiothreitol. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase did not affect the inhibitory actions of CO. Instead, inhibitors of complex III (but not complex I) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and a mitochondrially targeted antioxidant (Mito Q) fully prevented the effects of CO. Our data indicate that the cardioprotective effects of HO-1 activity may be attributable to an inhibitory action of CO on cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels. Inhibition arises from the ability of CO to promote generation of reactive oxygen species from complex III of mitochondria. This in turn leads to redox modulation of any or all of three critical cysteine residues in the channel's cytoplasmic C-terminal tail, resulting in channel inhibition.

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated.Application of CO—For these experiments, we employed either CO dissolved in perfusate or the well established CO-releasing molecule, CORM-2 ([Ru(CO3)Cl2]2, tricarbonyldichlororuthenium(II) dimer) (23Motterlini R. Clark J.E. Foresti R. Sarathchandra P. Mann B.E. Green C.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: E17-E24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare CO-containing solutions, extracellular perfusate was bubbled for at least 2 h under positive pressure with CO. This solution was assumed to be saturated with CO and then diluted 1:5 before application to cells. This dilution was selected because it would result in the pO2 of the perfusate only falling to a potential minimum of ∼120 mm Hg, which is not sufficiently hypoxic to alter Ca2+ channel function through lack of available O2 (24Fearon I.M. Palmer A.C.V. Balmforth A.J. Ball S.G. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Peers C. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CORM-2 was purchased from Sigma, freshly prepared in DMSO, and diluted to the required concentration in extracellular recording solution for the experiments described. Also prepared in DMSO, dichlorotetrakis (dimethylsulfoxide) ruthenium(II), the breakdown product (RuCl2(DMSO)4) of CORM-2 kindly synthesized by the Department of Chemistry and referred to herein as inactive CORM-2 (iCORM-2), was used as a control. In all experiments, the concentration of DMSO used did not exceed 0.1% (i.e. 1:1000 dilution).Cardiac Myocyte Isolation—Rats were killed by an intraperitoneal overdose of sodium pentobarbitone, and the hearts were rapidly excised into oxygenated physiological saline solution. Hearts were mounted on a Langendorff apparatus and perfused at 5 ml/min at 37 °C with a series of solutions based on an “isolation solution” of the following composition: 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm taurine, 10 mm creatine, pH 7.3. The first solution, containing 750 μm CaCl2, was perfused for 4 min. The heart was then perfused for 4 min with Ca2+-free isolation solution containing 100 μm Na2EGTA. Finally, perfusion was switched to the isolation solution containing 200 μm CaCl2 and collagenase (Worthington type 2; 0.1 mg/ml) for 9–12 min. The left ventricle was dissected and finely chopped in an enzyme-containing solution with 1% bovine serum albumin and gently agitated in a water bath at 37 °C. Aliquots of the cell suspension were examined every 5 min until a >80% yield of rod-shaped cells with a clear striation pattern was obtained. Myocytes were collected by filtration through nylon gauze and gentle centrifugation.Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were cultured in growth medium comprising MEM with Earle's salts and l-glutamine, supplemented with 9% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Globepharm, Esher, Surrey, UK), 1% (v/v) nonessential amino acids, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin in a humidified atmosphere of air/CO2 (19:1) at 37 °C. All culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen unless otherwise stated.Mutagenesis—Full-length hHT and rHT α1C cDNAs, previously described and deposited in GenBank™ (accession numbers are L04569 and L29536 for hHT and rHT, respectively), were ligated into the pcDNA3.1(+) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) and used for transfection of HEK293 cells as described below. Deletion of segments within the 71-amino acid insert of hHT (shown in Fig. 3) was performed by introducing two unique NruI restriction sites flanking the desired stretch using the MegaPrimer PCR strategy, cutting with NruI, and then religating the α1C(hHT) cDNA. Procedures have been described in depth previously (25Scragg J.L. Fearon I.M. Ball S.G. Schwartz A. Varadi G. Peers C. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 381: 290-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Individual Cys to Ser substitutions were similarly generated using the MegaPrimer PCR strategy.Cell Transfections—HEK293 cells were transfected with the appropriate pcDNA3.1/α1C construct using the PolyFect reagent (Qiagen, Hybaid Ltd., Teddington, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cell lines were selected with G-418 antibiotic (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen) added 3 days after transfection. Selection was applied for 4 weeks (media changed every 4–5 days), colonies were then picked, grown to confluence, and screened electrophysiologically after plating onto coverslips for 24–48 h. G418 selection was maintained throughout the cloning process at 1 mg/ml and then reduced to 200 μg/ml in all subsequent passages once stable clones had been positively identified.Electrophysiology—Cardiac myocytes were placed in the recording chamber and allowed to settle before perfusion was applied. Patch pipettes (1–3 megaohms resistance) were filled with 115 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 5 mm MgATP, 0.1 mm Tris-GTP, 1 mm CaCl2 (pH adjusted to 7.0 with CsOH). Once the whole cell configuration was established, perfusion was activated with a solution of composition 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm CsCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm HEPES, and 11 mm glucose (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH). Cells were voltage-clamped at –80 mV, and to inactivate Na+ and T-type Ca2+ channels, a 50-ms prepulse to –30 mV was applied immediately before each test pulse. L-type currents were then activated by successive depolarizations to +10 mV (75-ms duration, 0.1 Hz).HEK 293 cells attached to coverslip fragments were placed in a perfused (2–4 ml/min) chamber, and whole cell patch clamp recordings were made as previously described (26Fearon I.M. Varadi G. Koch S. Isaacsohn I. Ball S.G. Peers C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Perfusate contained 95 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 20 mm BaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 10 mmd-glucose, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride (pH 7.4, 21–24 °C). Patch electrodes (resistance 4–7 megaohms) contained 120 mm CsCl, 20 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm ATP (pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). Cells were clamped at –80 mV, and whole cell capacitance was determined from analogue compensation. Series resistance compensation of 70–90% was applied. Whole cell currents were evoked by 100-ms step depolarizations to various test potentials (0.1 Hz), and leak subtraction was applied as previously described (26Fearon I.M. Varadi G. Koch S. Isaacsohn I. Ball S.G. Peers C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Holding current in any recording was <50 pA, and any recordings in which this fluctuated by more than 10% were discarded. Evoked currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 2 kHz, and current amplitudes were measured over the last 10–15 ms of each step depolarization. Since Ba2+ was used as the charge carrier, they displayed little or no inactivation during step depolarizations. Currents showing notable run down before CORM-2 application were discarded.All voltage clamp and analysis protocols were performed with the use of an Axopatch 200A amplifier/Digidata 1200 interface controlled by Clampex 9.0 software (Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA). Offline analysis was performed using the data analysis package Clampfit 9.0 (Molecular Devices). Results are presented as means ± S.E., and statistical analysis was performed using unpaired Student's t tests, where p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Generation of ρ0 Cells—Cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 cells) were generated by incubation in medium containing EtBr (50 ng/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and uridine (50 μg/ml) (27King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). Verification of mitochondrial DNA loss was performed following RNA extraction using the Aurum total RNA minikit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from eluted RNA samples using the iScript™ Select cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad), and real time RT-PCR was carried out using the Applied Biosystems (ABI) 7500 real time PCR system and Taqman® probes (ABI). β-Actin and 28 S ribosomal RNA were used as endogenous controls (ABI). Cytochrome b and COX2 (cytochrome oxidase subunit II) were the mitochondrial target genes (ABI). Data were analyzed using the 7500 software (ABI), and relative gene expression was calculated using the 2–ΔΔCT method using either β actin or 28 S as an endogenous control and cells cultured in the absence of EtBr as a calibrator.RESULTSCO Inhibits Cardiac L-type Ca2+ Channels—Ca2+ channel currents evoked in rat ventricular cardiac myocytes by successive depolarizations from –30 to +10 mV were reversibly inhibited by exposure to the CO donor CORM-2 (30 μm) in the perfusate (Fig. 1, A, D, and E). Effects were maximal within 2 min but required much longer to recover (e.g. Fig. 2E). CORM-2 is an established CO donor molecule (28Wu L. Wang R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 585-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 29Boczkowski J. Poderoso J.J. Motterlini R. Trends Biochem.

Pharmacol. 2007; 150: 961-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and its effects can be attributed to released CO, since the inactive form (iCORM-2) of the donor was without significant effect (Fig. 1, B and D). Furthermore, exposure of cells to dissolved CO (see “Experimental Procedures”) similarly inhibited currents (Fig. 1, C and D). Cardiac myocyte Ca2+ currents commonly run down with time during prolonged recordings. We observed a small degree of run down (Fig. 1E), but this clearly does not account for the slowly reversible inhibitory effects of CO or CORM-2 (Fig. 1E).FIGURE 1CO inhibits L-type Ca2+ currents in rat cardiomyocytes.

As in cardiac myocytes, effects were largely but slowly reversible and not associated with any marked changes in current kinetics (Fig. 2A). The effects of CORM-2 were concentration-dependent (Fig. 2B) with a calculated IC50 of 14.8 ± 0.9 μm. Importantly, currents were largely unaffected (∼10% inhibition) either by the vehicle, DMSO, or by the inactive breakdown product, iCORM-2 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the effects of CORM-2 were largely due to its release of CO, as has previously been established (29Boczkowski J. Poderoso J.J. Motterlini R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 614-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Chatterjee P.K. Br. J.

Science. 2004; 306: 2093-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To confirm this, we exposed cells to dissolved CO and observed a similar degree of reversible inhibition (Fig. 2, A and B). Construction of current-voltage relationships indicated that the inhibitory effects of CO were apparent at all activating test potentials (Fig. 2C), indicating a lack of voltage dependence. Thus, the ability of CO to inhibit L-type Ca2+ currents in myocytes was fully reproducible in cells expressing only the pore-forming α1C subunit of the human channel. To investigate the structural requirements for CO inhibition of the channel and to probe candidate mechanisms of inhibition, we subsequently employed the recombinant α1C subunit and examined its responses to CORM-2.Splice Insert Requirement for Ca2+ Channel CO Sensitivity—We have previously shown that splice variation in the cytoplasmic C-tail region of the α1C channel protein is a key determinant of some of the physiological responses of this channel (26Fearon I.M. Varadi G. Koch S. Isaacsohn I. Ball S.G. Peers C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A indicates that this 71-amino acid (aa) region is also an absolute requirement for inhibition by CO. Thus, the full-length hHT variant is CO-sensitive, but the rHT variant, lacking the C-tail insert, was insensitive to CO. To investigate which region of this insert is required for CO sensitivity, we generated deletion mutants according to the schematic of Fig. 3B, and responses to 30 μm CORM-2 are summarized in Fig. 3C. We found that only those mutants with an intact region spanning residues 1787–1818 (i.e. mutants Δ4 and Δ7) demonstrated CO sensitivity. Importantly, their responses were quantitatively similar to the full-length hHT variant, suggesting that this region of the channel was necessary and sufficient for CO sensitivity.CO Acts Independently of NO and Protein Kinase G—CO is an established activator of NO production, possibly by activating nitric-oxide synthase (1Kim H.P. Ryter S.W. Choi A.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 411-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 32Lim I. Gibbons S.J. Lyford G.L. Miller S.M. Strege P.R. Sarr M.G. Chatterjee S. Szurszewski J.H. Shah V.H. Farrugia G. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G7-G14Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To investigate any role of NO, we first tested the effects of an NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (carboxy-PTIO), and the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (both applied at 1 mm for 20 min prior to and during recordings). Neither affected the ability of CO (applied as CORM-2; 30 μm) to inhibit Ca2+ currents (Fig. 4, A and B). We also found that two distinct NO donors, SIN-1 (10 μm) and S-nitrosoglutathione (2 mm), failed to mimic the inhibitory actions of CO and did not significantly alter Ca2+ currents (Fig. 4, A and B). Finally, the protein kinase G inhibitor PET-cGMPS (100 nm, 2-h preincubation) was also without effect on the ability of CO to inhibit Ca2+ currents. All of these NO-related compounds were functionally active, as determined by their ability to modulate the activity of the recombinant leak K+ channel hTREK-1 (33Dallas M. Scragg J.L. Peers C. Neuroreport. 2008; 19: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory actions of CO on L-type Ca2+ currents were independent of the NO/PKG pathway.FIGURE 4Inhibition of hHT Ca2+ currents by CO does not involve NO or protein kinase G.

The lower traces show the lack of effect of two NO donors, SIN-1 (10 μm) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO; 2 mm), and the lack of effect of the PKG inhibitor PET-cGMPS (100 nm) on the CO-mediated inhibition of currents, as indicated.

https://openalex.org/W1979976641,"Specificity of sensory neurons requires restricted expression of one sensory receptor gene and the exclusion of all others within a given cell. In the Drosophila retina, functional identity of photoreceptors depends on light-sensitive Rhodopsins (Rhs). The much simpler larval eye (Bolwig organ) is composed of about 12 photoreceptors, eight of which are green-sensitive (Rh6) and four blue-sensitive (Rh5). The larval eye becomes the adult extraretinal 'eyelet' composed of four green-sensitive (Rh6) photoreceptors. Here we show that, during metamorphosis, all Rh6 photoreceptors die, whereas the Rh5 photoreceptors switch fate by turning off Rh5 and then turning on Rh6 expression. This switch occurs without apparent changes in the programme of transcription factors that specify larval photoreceptor subtypes. We also show that the transcription factor Senseless (Sens) mediates the very different cellular behaviours of Rh5 and Rh6 photoreceptors. Sens is restricted to Rh5 photoreceptors and must be excluded from Rh6 photoreceptors to allow them to die at metamorphosis. Finally, we show that Ecdysone receptor (EcR) functions autonomously both for the death of larval Rh6 photoreceptors and for the sensory switch of Rh5 photoreceptors to express Rh6. This fate switch of functioning, terminally differentiated neurons provides a novel, unexpected example of hard-wired sensory plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2017341363,"Snail, a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin expression, plays a role in the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, the molecular basis of the role of snail in epithelial-mesenchymal transition has not been fully clarified. Here we show that the expression of snail in epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and A431 cells enhances both cell detachment and attachment. Snail did not confer resistance to anoikis induced by loss of contact but instead enhanced cell attachment to extracellular matrices such as fibronectin. This attachment was inhibited by Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides. Up-regulation of the promoter activity of integrin αV was observed in snail-expressing MDCK (MDCK/snail) cells. Snail also enhanced MDCK cell migration toward osteopontin that is a ligand for integrin αVβ3. We confirmed the reduction of basement membrane proteins such as laminin (LN) α3, β3, and γ2 (laminin-5/LN-5) and of receptors for LN-5 such as integrins α3, α6, or β4 in MDCK/snail or in snail-expressing A431 (A431/snail) cells. Nevertheless, suppression of LN-α3 chain by transient transfection of small interference RNAs resulted in no enhancement of cell detachment. We also found an induction of matrix metalloproteinase-3 in MDCK/snail and A431/snail cells. However, the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-3 showed no significant effect on the detachment of MDCK/snail cells. These results suggest that snail enhances cell detachment by multiple mechanism and leads to cell migration and reattachment at a second site, at least in part, by changing the expression of integrins in the cells.

Over the last few years, several transcription factors have been characterized as repressors of E-cadherin. These factors repress E-cadherin transcription through binding to the proximal E-boxes of the human or murine promoters for E-cadherin (5Bolos V. Peinard H. Perez-Moreno M.A. Fraga M.F. Esreller M.

Among these repressors of E-cadherin, the zinc-finger factor snail induces a full EMT when overexpressed in epithelial MDCK cells leading to the acquisition of a motile/invasive phenotype (7Cano A.

Fusening N.N. Niet M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2827-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In agreement with this role of EMT induction, snail has been found to down-regulate the expression of epithelial genes, such as occludin and claudin (9Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and to induce the expression of mesenchymal and invasive genes, such as FN and MMP-9 (7Cano A. Perez-Moreno M.A. Rodrigo I.

The conversion of tumor cells from an epithelial to the mesenchymal phenotype is closely associated with the acquisition of metastatic potential (11Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Brand-Saberi B. Acta Anat. (Basel). 1996; 156: 17-26Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Snail expression has been detected in an increasing number of human carcinoma and melanoma cell lines (12Peinado H. Portillo F. Cano A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 48: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). More importantly in terms of cell motility, snail is expressed at the invasive front of epidermoid carcinomas (8Peinado H. Marine F. Cubillo E. Stark H.J. Fusening N.N. Niet M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2827-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and is associated with the invasiveness of ductal breast carcinomas and hepatocarcinomas (13Blanco M.J. Moreno-Bueno G.

However, the precise role of snail in tumor progression has not been clarified.BMs are dynamic, thin, sheet-like structures that consist of ECM proteins, on which epithelial cells reside. Disruption of the BM itself or integrins, the receptors for BM components, contributes to the tumor process (15Havenith M.G. Arends J.W. Simon R. Volovics A. Wiggers T. Bosman F.T. Cancer. 1988; 62: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). BM is composed of a number of different proteins. LN, the main component of BM, is comprised of at least 15 different LN trimers. LN-5 is composed of α3, β3, and γ2 chains and is present in most epithelial BMs. LN-5 interacts with integrin α6β4 and plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of epithelial cells (16Ryan M.C. Lee K. Miyashita Y. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Oral squamous carcinoma cells that overexpress snail are deficient in LN-5 synthesis (17Takkunen M. Grenman R. Hukkanen M. Korhonen M. García de Herreros A. Virtanen I. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2006; 54: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found the expressions of LN-5 and its receptor proteins integrin α3, α6, and β4 were strongly suppressed in snail-expressing cells. However, cell detachment was not enhanced by inhibition of the expression of LN-5. These findings indicate that snail must affect the expressions of other molecules besides LN-5 to induce cell detachment.Collagen IV is also a major component of BM. It has been suggested that Collagen IV α5/α6 chains might protect against rapid cancer progression, as it has been shown that the normal production and assembly of BM is disrupted during malignant cancer progression (18Ikeda K. Iyama K. Ishikawa N. Egami H. Nakao M. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Baba H. Am. J.

Enhanced expression of integrin αVβ3, in either a solid tumor or a melanoma, has been shown to correlate with tumor malignancy and with enhanced tumor cell growth and invasion (19Hood J.D.

Furthermore, enhanced activity of integrin αVβ3 leads to increased tumor cell migration and adhesion to bone matrix protein (21Pecheur I. Peyruchaud O. Serre C.M. Guglielmi J. Voland C. Bourre F. Margue C. Cohen-Solal M. Buffet A. Kieffer N. Clezardin P. FASEB J. 2002; 10: 1266-1268Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar).Although genetic alterations in cancerous cells may vary in different types of metastatic cancers, all of these cancers share the characteristic of dissemination to multiple distant organs (22Chambers A.F. Groom A.C. MacDonald I.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 563-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3006) Google Scholar, 23Bogenrieder T. Herlyn M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6524-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Typically, these aggressive cells detach from the site of origin, move across tissue boundaries, eventually extravasate from these vessels, and then colonize new sites. Although numerous studies have examined cell migration and invasion in snail-expressing cells, a role for snail expression in the regulation of cell attachment or detachment has not been described. This is the first report that demonstrates that snail enhances cell detachment from and attachment to ECM proteins at least in part by regulating the expression of integrins and BM proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Transfection—MDCK and A431 were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). MDCK and A431 cells were transfected with 10 μg of HA-tagged human snail expression vector or control vector by a calcium phosphate method, as described previously (10Jorda M. Olmeda D. Vinyals A. Valero E. Cubillo E. Llorens A. Cano A. Fabra A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3371-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and were designated MDCK/snail, MDCK/neo, A431/snail, and A431/neo cells, respectively. We mainly used dog MDCK cells in this series of experiments, because we believe the cells show typical normal epithelial cell phenotype. However, because of the limited commercial availability of antibodies that recognize canine proteins, we also used human A431 cells. The mouse osteoblast cell line, MC3T3-E1 (kindly provided by Dr. Ohnishi, Kagoshima University), was maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS containing antibiotics. To initiate osteoblast differentiation, confluent MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and 5 mm glycerophosphate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). After 4 weeks of treatment, the conditioned medium of these cells was collected every 4–5 days (24Bandow K. Nishikawa Y. Ohnishi T. Kakimoto K. Soejima K. Iwabuchi S. Kuroe K. Matsuguchi T. J. Cell Physiol. 2007; 211: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against E-cadherin, integrins αV, α3, α5, and β4, and LN-β3 were purchased from BD Biosciences (Lexington, KY). Mouse anti-human integrin αVβ3 antibody (LM609) was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody against vinculin was purchased from Sigma. Rat monoclonal antibody against HA was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). Human fibronectin was purchased from BD Biosciences Labware (Bedford, MA). Human collagen IV was purchased from Chemicon. Human collagen I was purchased from Collaborative Biomedical products (Bedford, MA). Mouse osteopontin was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human LN-5 was purchased from Oriental Yeast Co. (Nagahama, Japan). FN-related peptides (GRGDSP and GRGESP) were purchased from Takara (Otsu, Japan).Attachment Assays—Attachment assays were performed as follows. Briefly, FCS or 10 μg/ml of FN and LN-1 solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was spread evenly on the surface of 96-well plates. The protein was allowed to adsorb for either 1 or 12 h at 37 °C. Nonspecific interactions were blocked with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. Cell suspensions were prepared in serum-free DMEM, and 2.5 × 104 cells were seeded on 96-well plates. After 30- to 40-min incubation, non-adherent cells were removed and adherent cells were fixed with 70% ethanol. Following staining with a 0.1% solution of crystal violet or methylene blue for 30 min, the cells were rinsed and the crystal violet or methylene blue adsorbed onto the adherent cells was dissolved with 0.5% Triton X-100. The optical density was then measured at 595 nm (25Heilshorn S.C. Dizio K.A. Welsh E.R. Tirrell D.A. Biomaterials. 2003; 24: 4245-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The number of the cells that adhered to the plate was calculated by using a cell-number standard curve (cell number versus absorbance values) and presented. For peptide inhibition assays the peptides GRGDNP and GRGESP, at a final concentration of 1 mm, were incubated with the cell suspension for 10 min before seeding of the cells to the wells.Detachment Assays—Suspended cells (1.2 × 104) were plated on 24-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then dissociated from the culture plate by incubation with 0.125% trypsin/0.1 mm EDTA or 0.025% trypsin/0.02 mm EDTA at 37 °C for the indicated times. DMEM containing 10% FCS or trypsin inhibitor was then added to the cells to inhibit trypsin. Following removal of the detached cells, the number of remaining cells was determined using crystal violet as described above. The data are also presented as a percentage of remained adherent cells to untreated cells. Detachment assays were performed in Transwell plates with a 0.4-μm pore size (Corning, Corning, NY). Cells (1 × 105) were seeded in the upper chamber of the Transwell plates, incubated for 24 h, and then treated with 0.125% trypsin/0.1 mm EDTA that was added to the lower chamber. At the indicated time trypsin was inactivated with 0.2% trypsin inhibitor, the cells in the upper chamber were rinsed, and the remained cells were determined by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as previously described (26Uchimiya H. Furukawa T. Okamoto M. Nakajima Y. Matsushita S. Ikeda R. Gotanda T. Haraguchi M. Sumizawa T. Ono M. Kuwano M. Kanzaki T. Akiyama S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2834-2839PubMed Google Scholar).RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA were extracted from the cells with the Isogen kit (Wako, Osaka Japan) and was reverse transcribed using ReverTra Ace (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The resulting cDNAs were employed as templates for specific PCR reactions using GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequences for PCR primers were listed in Table 1 and 2. RT-PCR of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control.TABLE 1Dog primer sequences for RT-PCRGeneForward primerReverse primerIntegrin αVTCTGTTGCTGCCACTGACATAACTGGTCTGGCTCTGTATAIntegrin α5GGCAGCCACGGCGTCCCGCTGTGGGCATCAGAGGTGGCAGGTGGCTTIntegrin α6GAACTGCTTTTATCGGTCTCAGAATGTCCAAGTAGTTCAGIntegrin β3GATGAGGCCCTGCCTCTGGGCTCCTTGCCGAACTTGGATGGAGAALN-α3ACAGATGGGGAAGGAAACAACAGTGGCCCGCTTTGCTTGGLN-β3CTGTCGAGAAGGGTTTGGTGTCTGCTCCATCTTGCTCCTGLN-γ2AATGGGAAGTCCAGGCAGTGTGTCACAGCGCTCGCCGGTGACAGCCollagen IVATGTCCATGGCGCCCATCGCCTTCAAGGTGGATGGCGTGGSyndecanAGGACGAGGGGAGCTATGACCGTGGGGGCCTTCTGATAAGMMP-3TGGGTCTCTTTCACTCGGCTGGATAACCGGCTTGTACCTCGAPDHTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGCCATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Human primer sequences for RT-PCRGeneForward primerReverse primerIntegrin αVAGAATCATTCCTATTCTCTGTTCTTCTTGAGGTGGCCGGAIntegrin β3CCTACATGACCGAAAATACCTAATCCCTCCCCACAAATACTGIntegrin β4GGTCCAGGAAGATCCATTTCAATAGCAGACCTCGTAGGCTGTGALN-α3ACAGATGGAGAGGGAAACAACATTTGCCTGCTTGGCTTGGLN-γ2TCAGCCAGAAGGTTTCAGATGCCGGCCAGCTTCACTGTTGCTCAAGCAGCollagen IVATGTCAATGGCACCCATCACCTTCAAGGTGGACGGCGTAGSyndecanAGGACGAAGGCAGCTACTCCTTTTGGTGGGCTTCTGGTAGGMMP-3GAACAATGGACAAAGGATACAACAAATGAAAACGAGGTCCTTGCTAGSnailACTACAGCGAGCTGCAGGGTGTGGCTTCGGATGTGCGAPDHGCATCCTGGGCTACACTGGTGAGGAGGGGAGATTCAG Open table in a new tab siRNA-mediated Protein Knockdown—MDCK/neo cells (2 × 105) were seeded per well in 6-well plates in antibiotic-free DMEM with FCS. After 24-h incubation, MDCK/neo cells were transfected with an siRNA duplex directed against LN-α3 (Sigma Genosys, Ishikari, Japan) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The sequence of the siRNA target was 5′-AAATGACTACGAAGCCAAACT-3′ (27Mak G.Z. Kavanaugh G.M. Buschmann M.M. Stickley S.M. Koch M. Goss K.H. Waechter H. Zuk A. Matlin K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3664-3677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 5 h, FCS was then added and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. The cells were then harvested and seeded for further experiments.Anoikis Assay—Poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (poly-HEMA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was applied to 6-well plates (0.5 ml/well of a 12 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol) and allowed to air dry. This procedure was repeated twice. MDCK/neo and MDCK/snail cells (5 × 105/well) were cultured either on poly-HEMA-coated or non-coated plates for 24 h. After incubation, detached and suspended cells from poly-HEMA-coated plates were harvested in DMEM and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. Cells from non-coated plates were trypsinized, collected, and centrifuged in a similar manner. The pellets were stained with 100 μl of propidium iodide (PI) solution (10 μg/ml in PBS) at 25 °C for 15 min. The number of viable cells was then analyzed by using flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Assay—MDCK/neo and MDCK/snail cells (1 × 105) were cultured either on poly-HEMA coated, or non-coated 24-well plates for 24 h at 37 °C. The medium was recovered from cell culture and was assayed for LDH, released from dying cells, using a previously described method (28Haraguchi M. Torii S. Matsuzawa S. Xie Z. Kitada S. Krajewski S. Yoshida H. Mak T.W. Reed J.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1709-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Data for released LDH were normalized relative to total LDH and expressed as a percentage. All measurements were performed in triplicate.Promoter Assay—The mouse integrin αV promoter, with the indicated deletions of the 5′-flanking region, was cloned upstream from the luciferase reporter gene (pGL3-Basic vector, Promega). The luciferase expression vectors, including the fragments deleted up to positions –3200, –1500, –933, –617, –310, –108, +22, to +97 were designated pIαV(–3.2k)-Luc, pIαV(–1.5k)-Luc, pIαV(–933)-Luc, pIαV(–617)-Luc, pIαV(–310)-Luc, pIαV(–108)-Luc, pIαV(+22)-Luc, and pIαV(+97)-Luc, respectively (29Kambe M. Miyamoto Y. Hayashi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 105) were seeded into 24-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. One microgram of reporter vector and 20 ng of pRL-CMV vector were transfected per well using Lipofectamine Plus. After 48 h, both firefly (FL) and Renilla luciferase (RL) activities were measured using the Dual luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). FL activities were normalized to the RL activities. The experiments were performed in triplicate.Migration Assay—Migration assays were performed in Transwell plates with an 8-μm pore size (Corning) as described previously (26Uchimiya H. Furukawa T. Okamoto M. Nakajima Y. Matsushita S. Ikeda R. Gotanda T. Haraguchi M. Sumizawa T. Ono M. Kuwano M. Kanzaki T. Akiyama S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2834-2839PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 0.1 ml of cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA was seeded into the upper wells. FN or osteopontin was added to 0.6 ml of DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA in the lower wells at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Conditioned medium of MC3T3-E1 cells or fresh medium containing 10% FCS (0.15 ml) was added to 0.45 ml of DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA in lower wells. After 4 h of incubation, the cells remaining in the upper wells were completely removed. The cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filter were subjected to the MTT assay.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSSnail Enhances Cell Detachment from Tissue Culture Dishes—We observed that the transfection of snail into MDCK cells enhanced cell detachment from tissue culture dishes. We therefore quantified detachment of MDCK/snail cells and compared it to that of MDCK/neo cells. Cells were sparsely seeded to inhibit cell-cell contacts. Following incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the cells were treated with 0.125% trypsin/0.1 mm EDTA for up to 10 min. The remaining adherent cells were then stained with crystal violet, and the percentage of remaining cells to total cells was assessed. Approximately 88% of MDCK/snail cells detached within 1 min by trypsin/EDTA treatment (Fig. 1A). In contrast, only ∼55% of MDCK/neo cells were detached at this time point. We also found that ∼83% of A431/snail cells whereas only 35% of A431/neo cells detached within 4 min by 0.025% trypsin/0.02 mm EDTA treatment (Fig. 1B). It has been proposed that cell-cell junctional complexes can inhibit the accessibility of trypsin to cell surface proteins that mediate cell attachment to the substratum. E-cadherin is considered to be the main component of junctional complexes that mediates this inhibition. To remove the effect of adhesion proteins on the accessibility of trypsin, we performed the detachment assay in Transwell chambers. MDCK/snail or MDCK/neo cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in the upper part of the chambers and, 24 h later, 0.1% trypsin/0.02% EDTA was added to the lower part of the chambers. Cells remaining adhered to the upper chamber were then counted by MTT assay. Over 80% of MDCK/snail cells were detached after 3 min of trypsin treatment compared with only 3% of MDCK/neo cells (Fig. 1C). Therefore, altered accessibility of trypsin to the proteins involved in cell-substrate attachment is not the reason why MDCK/snail cells show accelerated cell detachment compared with control cells.Snail Reduces the Expression of ECM Proteins—We next determined whether the rapid detachment of snail-expressing cells was due to changes in the ECM produced by these cells. We therefore compared the adhesion of MDCK/neo or MDCK/snail cells to the ECM deposited by either cell type. MDCK/snail cells adhered to the ECM deposited by both the MDCK/neo and MDCK/snail cells, with a comparable extent. However, MDCK/neo cells were much less adherent to the ECM laid down by MDCK/snail cells than to their own ECM (Fig. 2). This result suggests that the ECM components deposited by the MDCK/snail cells must be altered in some way. The expression of ECM proteins involved in binding to the receptors of MDCK/neo cells might be reduced in MDCK/snail cells. The ECM prepared with deoxycholic acid had more ability to support adhesion of MDCK/neo cells than that prepared with trypsin. Trypsin might degrade the proteins that involved in the adhesion of MDCK/neo cells. Furthermore, the expression of receptors for ECM proteins may be altered in MDCK/snail cells, thereby MDCK/snail cells adhered to the ECM from both cell types to a comparable level. The major adhesive components expressed and secreted by epithelial cells are LN, heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and collagens. We therefore determined protein and mRNA expressions of these molecules in MDCK/neo, MDCK/snail, A431/neo, and A431/snail cells. LN-β3 protein was undetectable in MDCK/snail nor A431/snail cells but was expressed in MDCK/neo and A431/neo cells, as measured with an antibody against LN-β3 (Fig. 3, A–D). The expressions of the LN-α3, -β3, and -γ2 subunits were also reduced in MDCK/snail cells, and the expressions of LN-α3 and γ2 were reduced in A431/snail cells when assayed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3, E and F). In agreement with a previous report, the expression of vimentin, as measured by Western blot, was enhanced in MDCK/snail and in A431/snail cells compare with MDCK/neo cells and A431/neo cells (Fig. 3, A–C). In contrast, the level of mRNA expression of syndecan was similar in MDCK/neo and MDCK/snail cells and A431/neo or A431/snail cells when assayed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3, E and F). We also found not only LN-5 protein expression but also the expressions of receptor proteins for LN-5 such as integrin α3 and α6 were strongly suppressed in MDCK/snail cells as assessed by Western blot (Fig. 3, A and C) or by RT-PCR (Fig. 3E), respectively. The expression of integrin β4 was also suppressed in A431/snail cells as assessed by both Western blot (Fig. 3, B and D) and by RT-PCR (Fig. 3F). These data indicate that snail regulates the expression of specific ECM proteins and their receptors. We also determined the expressions of decorin, collagen I, integrin α2, integrin β1, and MMP-2, and found they were unaltered in snail-expressing cells (data not shown).FIGURE 2The ECM produced by MDCK/snail cells is less adhesive for MDCK/neo cells than that produced by MDCK/neo cells. To obtain the deposited ECM for this assay, MDCK/neo and MDCK/snail cells were seeded (5 × 104 cells/well) on 24-well plates and incubated for 48 h. The cells were then removed from the matrix protein by treatment with 0.1% deoxycholic acid (DC) or 0.125% trypsin/0.1 mm EDTA (trypsin). The ECM deposited by MDCK/neo (neo DC and neo trypsin) or by MDCK/snail (snail DC and snail trypsin) were washed with DMEM with 10% FCS and PBS. Blocking of nonspecific interactions was achieved by incubation with 0.2% BSA. MDCK/neo and MDCK/snail cells were then seeded (5 × 104 cells/well) onto the ECM-covered plates and incubated for 40 min at 37 °C in DMEM without FCS. After removing the non-adherent cells with PBS, adherent cells were quantified by staining with crystal violet.

Agents that target Top2, involving etoposide, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone, are among the most effective anticancer drugs used in the clinic. Mammalian cells possess two genetically distinct Top2 isoforms, both of which are the target of these agents. Top2α is essential for cell proliferation and is highly expressed in vigorously growing cells, whereas Top2β is nonessential for growth and has recently been implicated in treatment-associated secondary malignancies, highlighting the validity of a Top2α-specific drug for future cancer treatment; however, no such agent has been hitherto reported. Here we show that NK314, a novel synthetic benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloid, targets Top2α and not Top2β in vivo. Unlike other Top2 inhibitors, NK314 induces Top2-DNA complexes and double-strand breaks (DSBs) in an α isoform-specific manner. Heterozygous disruption of the human TOP2α gene confers increased NK314 resistance, whereas TOP2β homozygous knock-out cells display increased NK314 sensitivity, indicating that the α isoform is the cellular target. We further show that the absence of Top2β does not alleviate NK314 hypersensitivity of cells deficient in non-homologous end-joining, a critical pathway for repairing Top2-mediated DSBs. Our results indicate that NK314 acts as a Top2α-specific poison in mammalian cells, with excellent potential as an efficacious and safe chemotherapeutic agent.

Despite their similar structural features (∼70% identity at the amino acid level) and biological properties, the two isoforms are differentially regulated and play different roles in living cells. Top2α is most abundantly expressed in rapidly growing tissues and its expression is cell cycle-regulated, peaking in G2/M, whereas Top2β is expressed in virtually all tissues and it is expressed throughout the cell cycle (11Woessner R.D.

Res. 1994; 19: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) implies the validity of α isoform-specific Top2 inhibitor in cancer treatment. Indeed, two studies suggested that Top2α, rather than Top2β, was the determinant of cytotoxic effects of etoposide (27Azarova A.M. Lyu Y.L. Lin C.P. Tsai Y.C. Lau J.Y. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11014-11019Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 28Errington F. Willmore E. Tilby M.J. Li L. Li G. Li W. Baguley B.C. Austin C.A. Mol.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11014-11019Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) suggested that Top2β may be responsible for the development of secondary malignancy associated with etoposide treatment. Hence, it is quite reasonable to expect that α isoform-specific Top2 poisons will be efficacious and safe chemotherapeutic agents with reduced risk of treatment-related secondary malignancies. To our knowledge, however, no such agent has been reported thus far. NK314 is a novel synthetic benzo[c]phenanthridine alkaloid that exhibits strong antitumor activity (29Onda T. Toyoda E. Miyazaki O. Seno C. Kagaya S. Okamoto K. Nishikawa K. Cancer Lett. 2007; 259: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We previously reported that the drug stabilizes Top2 cleavage complexes and induces rapid DSBs to cause G2 arrest in tumor cells (29Onda T. Toyoda E. Miyazaki O. Seno C. Kagaya S. Okamoto K. Nishikawa K. Cancer Lett. 2007; 259: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Guo L. Liu X. Nishikawa K. Plunkett W. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 1501-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this article, we find that NK314 acts as an α isoform-specific Top2 poison in living mammalian cells. We demonstrate that NK314 induces Top2-DNA complexes and chromosomal DSBs in a Top2α-dependent manner. Furthermore, with the use of a series of human gene knock-out cell lines, we genetically investigate DNA damage and repair after NK314 treatment. This is the first report on the discovery and characterization of an α isoform-specific Top2 poison. Topoisomerase Inhibitors—NK314 and etoposide were synthesized at Nippon Kayaku (Tokyo, Japan). Doxorubicin hydrochloride and mitoxantrone hydrochloride were purchased from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and Wyeth K.K. (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Camptothecin, amsacrine, and XK469 were purchased from Sigma. ICRF-193 was purchased from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan). Etoposide, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, ICRF-193, and XK469 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). NK314 and doxorubicin were dissolved in distilled water. All the drugs were stored frozen in aliquots at –20 °C. Cells and Culture Conditions—All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The human pre-B cell line Nalm-6 and its derivatives were cultured in ES medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. The human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLaS3 was maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Asahi Glass Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate. The kidney cancer cell line ACHN (ATCC CRL 1611) was maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% non-essential amino acids. The non-small cell lung cancer cell line H460 (ATCC HTB 177) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10 mm Hepes. The colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line DLD-1 was obtained from JCRB Cell Bank (Tokyo, Japan) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Top2β+/+ and Top2β–/– cells) were cultured in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1× penicillin/streptomycin. Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) Analysis—Cells were treated with Top2 inhibitor for 1 h, and chromosome-sized DNA was prepared from the cells using the CHEF Genomic DNA Plug Kit (Bio-Rad). Briefly, cells (1 × 106) were embedded to agarose plugs, and the plugs were treated with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm EDTA, 1% Sarkosyl) in the presence of 1 mg/ml proteinase K at 50 °C for 2 days, and washed three times with 50 mm EDTA. Plugs were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel prepared in 0.5× TBE buffer and electrophoresed using the CHEF-Mapper system (Bio-Rad). The running conditions were as follows: 14 °C, 60–120 s switch time, angle of 120°, and a voltage gradient of 6 V/cm. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) and photographed under ultraviolet light. Western Blot—Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (31Uegaki K. Adachi N. So S. Iiizumi S. Koyama H. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2006; 5: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-human Top2 monoclonal antibody (7B9) was kindly provided by Dr. Akihiko Kikuchi (32Sakaguchi A. Miyaike M. Kuroda K. Nozaki N. Tanaka M. Hibino M. Fujii Y. Kato S. Kikuchi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody against human Top2α or -β, and mouse anti-human Ku70 monoclonal antibody were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Bedford, MA). Mouse anti-actin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Levels of expression were quantified using a Fuji Image analyzer LAS-1000UVmini and a MultiGauge software (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). ICE Bioassay—Top2-DNA complex was detected by ICE bioassay essentially as described (33Trask D.K. Muller M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1417-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing cells were treated with Top2 drug for 30 min. After removing the drug-containing medium, the cells were dissolved by immediate addition of 3 ml of 1% Sarkosyl in TE (pH 7.5). After gentle douncing, the lysates were layered onto a 2-ml cushion of CsCl (1.5 g/ml) and centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 16–20 h at 25 °C. DNA pellets were collected and dissolved in TE buffer, followed by shearing using an ultrasonic generator to reduce viscosity. DNA concentrations were determined from absorbance at 260 nm, and equal amounts of DNA were blotted to nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a slot blot apparatus. Top2 protein (Top2α or Top2β) covalently bound to DNA was immunodetected with anti-human Top2α monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) or anti-human Top2β monoclonal antibody (TopoGEN, Inc., Columbus, OH), respectively, using the ECL Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare). TARDIS Assay—Drug-stabilized Top2 complexes were measured using the TARDIS assay essentially as described by Errington et al. (28Errington F. Willmore E. Tilby M.J. Li L. Li G. Li W. Baguley B.C. Austin C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (105 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well tissue culture dishes and grown for 48 h. NK314 or etoposide was added to exponentially growing cells at appropriate concentrations, and the cells were collected by trypsinization 90 min after drug addition, washed with ice-cold PBS, mixed with low melting point agarose in PBS, and spread onto agarose-coated microscope slides. The slides were placed in lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 80 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors for 30 min, followed by incubation for 30 min in 1 m NaCl plus protease inhibitors. The slides were then washed in PBS and incubated with anti-Top2β (18513β) (34Willmore E. Frank A.J. Padget K. Tilby M.J. Austin C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or anti-Top2α and -β (4882; raised against the N-terminal 140 kDa of bovine Top2) antibody for 1 h in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The slides were washed three times in PBS-T and incubated for 1 h with rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. The slides were washed three times in PBS-T followed by an overnight wash in PBS containing protease inhibitors at 4 °C. The slides were stained with Hoechst 33258 (10 mm in PBS). Separate gray scale images were captured for Hoechst 33258 and fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence using an epifluorescence microscope attached to a cooled slow scan CCD camera. For each of three randomly chosen fields of view, images of Hoechst 33258 (blue) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (green) fluorescence were captured to give a total of ∼100 cells/dose for each antibody. 16-Bit images were then analyzed to quantify the levels of blue and green fluorescence. All images were corrected for stray light and camera background and were subjected to blue and green shade correction to compensate for variations in intensity of illumination and non-uniformities in light transmission (34Willmore E. Frank A.J. Padget K. Tilby M.J. Austin C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Graphing and statistical analysis was carried out using Graph-Pad Prism software (Cherwell Scientific, Oxford, UK). Top2 Assays—Human Top2α and Top2β were purified as described previously (35Austin C.A. Marsh K.L. Wasserman R.A. Willmore E. Sayer P.J. Wang J.C. Fisher L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15739-15746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and used for in vitro Top2 assays. Decatenation assay was performed by using a Topo II Assay Kit (TopoGEN, Inc.). Briefly, 0.2 μg of kinetoplast DNA was incubated with Top2α or Top2β at 37 °C for 15 min in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, and 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of Top2 enzyme that decatenates 0.2 μg of kinetoplast DNA under standard conditions. To examine the inhibitory effect of NK314 and etoposide on Top2 catalytic activity, 0.2 μg of kinetoplast DNA was incubated with 2 units of Top2α or Top2β in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 5% DMSO at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence or absence of NK314 or etoposide. The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of loading dye (5% Sarkosyl, 0.0025% bromphenol blue, and 25% glycerol) and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml of ethidium bromide in TBE buffer. DNA cleavage assay was performed by using a Topo II Drug Screening Kit (TopoGEN, Inc.). Briefly, 0.2 μg of pRYG plasmid was incubated with 5 units of Top2α or Top2β in 20 μl of assay buffer containing 5% DMSO at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of NK314 or etoposide. DNA cleavage product was trapped by the addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS, and 2.5 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K was added to the sample, which was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to digest Top2. The samples were mixed with 2.5 μl of loading buffer and cleaned up by adding an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). After brief vortex mixing, the sample was spun in a microcentrifuge for 5 s. An aliquot (10 μl) of the upper aqueous phase was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml of ethidium bromide in TBE buffer. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated Gene Knockdown—Top2 knockdown experiments were carried out in the same manner as described previously (36Sakaguchi A. Kikuchi A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The Top2α-targeting siRNA corresponds to nucleotides 76 to 96, and the Top2β siRNA to nucleotides 86 to 106 (relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon). These siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen. As a nonspecific control, non-silencing control siRNA was used (sense, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′; antisense, 5′-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAdTdT-3′; Qiagen, Japan). HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Top2α, Top2β, and non-silencing control siRNAs were added to achieve final concentrations of 1, 10, and 10 nm, respectively. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were collected by trypsinization and plated at 2.5 × 105 cells in 60-mm dishes and cultured for 48 h, followed by Western blot analysis or clonogenic assays. For clonogenic assays, cells were cultured for 1 h in the presence of NK314. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were trypsinized, collected in 15-ml Falcon tubes, and counted. Cells were plated at 102–105 cells/dish into 60-mm dishes. After a 2-week incubation, colonies were fixed with methanol, stained with methylene blue, and counted. The percent survival was determined by comparing the number of surviving colonies to untreated controls. TOP2 Targeting Vectors—Targeting vectors were constructed by using a simplified construction method based on the MultiSite Gateway® Technology (Invitrogen) as described (37Iiizumi S. Nomura Y. So S. Uegaki K. Aoki K. Shibahara K. Adachi N. Koyama H. BioTechniques. 2006; 41: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA fragments were obtained by PCR amplification with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) from Nalm-6 genomic DNA using the following primers: Top2A5F (5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGAATGCTGCGGACAACAAACAAAGG-3′) and Top2A5R (5′-GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGAGCTGTCCAAATATGAGAGCTGGG-3′) for TOP2α 5′-arm, Top2A3F (5′-GGGGACAGCTTTCTTGTACAAAGTGGTGGAACTCAAGCCCTTCAATGGAG-3′) and Top2A3R (5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAATAAAGTTGTACAATACCACAGCCAATGGCCTG-3′) for TOP2α 3′-arm, Top2B5F (5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGCTGGTTCGTGTAGAGGGGTCAAGG-3′) and Top2B5R (5′-GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGCTACCACATAATCCACGTGCCGTC-3′) for TOP2β 5′-arm, and Top2B3F (5′-GGGGACAGCTTTCTTGTACAAAGTGGCCCAAACTGGATGATGCTAATGATG-3′) and Top2B3R (5′-GGGGACAACTTTGTATAATAAAGTTGATGTAGCCTACGCTGTCTCCGGTC-3′) for TOP2β 3′-arm. The TOP2α and TOP2β targeting vectors were linearized with I-SceI or AhdI, respectively, prior to transfection. Generation of Human Gene Knock-out Cell Lines—DNA transfection for gene targeting was performed in Nalm-6 cells as described previously (38Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 39So S. Adachi N. Lieber M.R. Koyama H. J. Biol.

Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, to generate TOP2α+/– and TOP2β–/– cells, 4 × 106 wild-type cells were electroporated with 4 μg of linearized targeting vector, cultured for 22–24 h, and replated at a density of 0.5–1 × 106 per 90-mm dish into agarose medium containing 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin B (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). After a 2–3-week incubation, hygromycin-resistant colonies were isolated and genomic DNA was prepared from each clone. Primers used for PCR screening were TOP2Acc (5′-TTAATGCCACTCCTGTGCTGTTTG-3′) and universal primer B (5′-AGGTTCACTAGTACTGGCCATTG-3′) (37Iiizumi S. Nomura Y. So S. Uegaki K. Aoki K. Shibahara K. Adachi N. Koyama H. BioTechniques. 2006; 41: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) for TOP2α targeting, and TOP2Bcc (5′-ATTGTGGCCCTCATGACTAGAAGGG-3′) and universal primer B for TOP2β targeting. To generate TOP2β–/– cells, TOP2β+/– cells were transfected with another targeting construct harboring a puromycin-resistance gene and selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan). Primers used for PCR screening were TOP2Bcc (see above) and universal primer A (5′-AATAATGGTTTCTTAGACGTGCG-3′) (37Iiizumi S. Nomura Y. So S. Uegaki K. Aoki K. Shibahara K. Adachi N. Koyama H. BioTechniques. 2006; 41: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). LIG4–/–TOP2α+/– and LIG4–/–TOP2β–/– cells were similarly generated from LIG4–/– cells (37Iiizumi S. Nomura Y. So S. Uegaki K. Aoki K. Shibahara K. Adachi N. Koyama H. BioTechniques. 2006; 41: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Generation of RAD54–/– and LIG4–/–RAD54–/– cells will be described elsewhere. 3A. Kurosawa, H. Koyama, S. Iiizumi, S. So, S. Nakamura, K. Iwabuchi, M. Lieber, and N. Adachi, unpublished results. Drug Sensitivity Assays—Clonogenic assays using Nalm-6 and its derivative cell lines were performed as described previously (39So S. Adachi N. Lieber M.R. Koyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55433-55442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing cells were plated at 102–105 cells/dish into 60-mm dishes containing 5 ml of agarose medium with various concentrations of DNA-damaging agents. After a 2–3-week incubation at 37 °C, visible colonies were counted, and the percent survival was determined by comparing the number of surviving colonies to untreated controls. For growth inhibition assays, 1 × 104 cells were seeded into 48-well plates and cultured for 96 h in growth medium containing various concentrations of topoisomerase inhibitor. Cell proliferation was measured by using the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Viability Assay kit (Promega) or methylene blue staining. Methylene blue staining was performed as previously described (41Kobori O. Vuillot M.T. Martin F. Int. J. Cancer. 1982; 30: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stained with 0.05% methylene blue dissolved in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.5) for 30 min, and washed thoroughly with distilled water. The stained dye was extracted with 3% HCl, and the absorbance at 660 nm was measured. Survival Assays with MEFs—MEFs (9 × 104 cells) at 50–80% confluence were plated in each of a series of 60-mm dishes. Cells were cultured in these dishes for 48 h before adding NK314. Serial dilutions of NK314 were prepared, resulting in final concentrations of 4–1024 nm in the dishes. Two hours after drug addition, the drug-containing medium was removed and plates were washed with PBS. Cells were trypsinized, collected in 15-ml Falcon tubes, and counted. Cells were plated in duplicate at 2 × 102–5 × 104 cells per 90-mm dish. After 8 days, colonies were fixed with Carnoy's solution, stained with crystal violet, and counted. NK314 Specifically Induces Top2α-DNA Complex—We previously showed that NK314 induced Top2 complexes and DSBs in several tumor cell lines (29Onda T. Toyoda E. Miyazaki O. Seno C. Kagaya S. Okamoto K. Nishikawa K. Cancer Lett. 2007; 259: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Guo L. Liu X. Nishikawa K. Plunkett W. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2007; 6: 1501-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this article, we first performed PFGE analysis of genomic DNA from drug-treated Nalm-6 cells (Fig. 1A). We employed this human cell line for two reasons. First, Nalm-6 expresses roughly equal levels of Top2α and Top2β (Fig. 1B), which should be advantageous to analyze the relative contribution of Top2 isoforms to DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Second, the cell line enables rapid production of gene knock-out cell lines by gene targeting (37Iiizumi S. Nomura Y. So S. Uegaki K. Aoki K. Shibahara K. Adachi N. Koyama H. BioTechniques. 2006; 41: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 42Adachi N. So S. Iiizumi S. Nomura Y. Murai K. Yamakawa C. Miyagawa K. Koyama H. DNA Cell Biol. 2006; 25: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (see below). As expected, we found that NK314 rapidly induces chromosomal DSBs, and this DSB induction was significantly alleviated by pretreatment with ICRF-193 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4), a Top2 inhibitor that does not stabilize the cleavage complex (43Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 44Andoh T. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made with the potent Top2 poison"
https://openalex.org/W2066143060,"The E2F family is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals, with some family members having transcription activation functions and others having repressor functions. Whereas C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster have a single E2F activator protein and repressor protein, mammals have at least three activator and five repressor proteins. Why such genetic complexity evolved in mammals is not known. To begin to evaluate this genetic complexity, we targeted the inactivation of the entire subset of activators, E2f1, E2f2, E2f3a and E2f3b, singly or in combination in mice. We demonstrate that E2f3a is sufficient to support mouse embryonic and postnatal development. Remarkably, expression of E2f3b or E2f1 from the E2f3a locus (E2f3a(3bki) or E2f3a(1ki), respectively) suppressed all the postnatal phenotypes associated with the inactivation of E2f3a. We conclude that there is significant functional redundancy among activators and that the specific requirement for E2f3a during postnatal development is dictated by regulatory sequences governing its selective spatiotemporal expression and not by its intrinsic protein functions. These findings provide a molecular basis for the observed specificity among E2F activators during development."
https://openalex.org/W1964405000,"Cell fate commitment of pre-implantation blastocysts, to either the inner cell mass or trophoblast, is the first step in cell lineage segregation of the developing human embryo. However, the intercellular signals that control fate determination of these cells remain obscure. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) provide a unique model for studying human early embryonic development. We have previously shown that Activin/Nodal signaling contributes to maintaining pluripotency of hESCs, which are derivatives of the inner cell mass. Here we further demonstrate that the inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling results in the loss of hESC pluripotency and trophoblast differentiation, similar to BMP4-induced trophoblast differentiation from hESCs. We also show that the trophoblast induction effect of BMP4 correlates with and depends on the inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling. However, the activation of BMP signaling is still required for trophoblast differentiation when Activin/Nodal signaling is inhibited. These data reveal that the early lineage segregation of hESCs is determined by the combinatorial signals of Activin/Nodal and BMP.

Trophoblast formation is the first lineage segregation in mammalian embryos. The inner cell mass forms all three germ layers of the body, and the trophoblast gives rise to the trophoblast lineages, which form the major fetal parts of the placenta. Therefore, the trophoblast is crucial for embryo implantation, as well as promotion of embryo survival and growth in the uterus. Trophoblast developmental disorders result in “missed abortions” (pregnancy loss during first two months of gestation), certain types of intrauterine growth restriction, and pre-eclampsia (1Rossant J. Cross J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 2Cross J.C. Baczyk D. Dobric N. Hemberger M. Hughes M. Simmons D.G. Yamamoto H. Kingdom J.C. Placenta. 2003; 24: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has become clear that the trophoblast also plays key roles in epiblast signaling to establish axial patterning in the embryo. Prior to gastrulation of the early post-implantation embryo, the extraembryonic ectoderm, a trophoblast derivative, is thought to provide general signals that promote expression of posterior mesoderm-specific genes in the underlying epiblast, such as Brachyury (3Lu C.C. Brennan J. Robertson E.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, correct segregation of the trophoblast from the inner cell mass is essential for body plan establishment and embryo survival. Mice are used extensively for studying the molecular regulation of early mammalian development, due to the advances of genetic manipulation. In the past few years, there has been significant progress in our understanding of genetic control of trophoblast development, which have mainly stemmed from analyses of targeted mutations in the mouse (1Rossant J. Cross J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 2Cross J.C. Baczyk D. Dobric N. Hemberger M. Hughes M. Simmons D.G. Yamamoto H. Kingdom J.C.

The current understanding of early human embryonic development is based largely on comparisons to mouse development; however, there are significant differences between murine and primate development that limit the usefulness of the mouse model.

We, along with others, have previously shown that Activin/Nodal signaling maintains hESC pluripotency (16Xiao L. Yuan X. Sharkis S.J. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17Beattie G.M. Lopez A.D. Bucay N. Hinton A. Firpo M.T. King C.C. Hayek A.

Development. 2005; 132: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further demonstrate that inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling results in the loss of hESC pluripotency and trophoblast differentiation. Both activin and Nodal belongs to the TGF-β superfamily that also includes BMP. The action of specificity of various ligands of this superfamily is controlled at multiple levels. Activin/Nodal as well as TGF-β use one set of receptors (Activin receptor-like kinase 4/5/7) and downstream of signal molecules (SMAD2 and SMAD3), whereas BMPs such as BMP4 utilize a different set of receptors (Activin receptor-like kinase 1/2/3/6) and activates different SMAD transducers (SMAD1/5/8) and other targets (19ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Two branches of TGF-β/BMP signaling pathways, one used by BMPs (and Smad1/5/8) and one used by Activin/Nodal/TGF-β (and SMA2/3) naturally antagonize each other, because activated Smad1/5/8 or SMAD2/3 need to compete for the common SMAD4, which is required for the activation of either branch (19ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). BMP4 has been reported to induce hESCs to differentiate into trophectoderm (13Xu R.H. Chen X. Li D.S. Li R. Addicks G.C. Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that BMP4 activity depends on inhibition of TGF-β/Activin/Nodal signaling, and this is further supported by results showing that TGF-β/Activin/Nodal signaling is able to reverse the effects of BMP4. We also found that activation of BMP signaling is required for the trophoblast development from hESCs when Activin/Nodal signaling is inhibited. Therefore, we conclude that Activin/Nodal and BMP signaling regulates early hESC lineage segregation. Both inhibition of Activin/Nodal and activation of BMP signaling are required for the trophoblast differentiation from hESCs. In addition, our data suggest that the Activin/Nodal and BMP signals might regulate trophoblast commitment, during human embryonic development in vivo. hESC Culture—The hESC line H1 (WA01) was kindly provided by Dr. Saul Sharkis from Johns Hopkins University, under permission from WiCell Research Institute (5Thomson J.A.

All hESC experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for research on human embryonic stem cells, jointly issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Health of China (20Cheng L. Qiu R.Z. Deng H. Zhang Y.A. Jin Y. Li L. Nature. 2006; 440: 992Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and approved by the ethical committee of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences. hESCs were maintained on feeders in hESC medium, which contained 80% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (F12), 20% knock-out serum replacement, 1 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 4 ng/ml human basic FGF. hESCs cells were passaged approximately once a week by incubation in 1 mg/ml collagenase IV for ∼30 min at 37 °C. Protein factors or SB431542 were added directly to the culture in the continued presence of conditioned medium (CM). Recombinant human Activin A, recombinant human BMP-4, and human Follistatin were purchased from R&D Systems Inc. SB431542 was purchased from Tocris Bioscience. RNA Isolation and Real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction—RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent for total RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using the RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas). Real-time PCR was performed using a Synergy Brand GreenI-based PCR Master mixture (TOYOBO). PCR primers are listed in supplemental Table S1. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. The expression value of each gene was normalized to the amount of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA to calculate a relative amount of RNA present in each sample. The expression level of each gene in a single sample was arbitrarily defined as 1 unit. The normalized expression values for all control and treated samples were averaged, and an average -fold change was determined. Analysis of variance was conducted between the normalized relative expression values for control and treated samples to determine statistical significance. Immunostaining—Immunostaining was performed similarly to previously described protocol (16Xiao L. Yuan X. Sharkis S.J. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: anti-SSEA4 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), anti-hCGα (R&D Systems), and anti-hCGβ (Abcam). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed with 1× lysis buffer: 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, and complete mini-protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Total protein (10 μg) was loaded for each lane. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween and 5% milk. The following antibodies were used: anti-phospho-Smad2/3 (Cell Signaling), anti-Smad2/3 (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-Smad1 (Santa Cruz), anti-Smad1 (Santa Cruz), anti-Oct4 (Santa Cruz), and β-Actin (Abcam). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight and secondary antibodies for 2 h. Proteins were detected with chemiluminescent (Pierce). Immunoassays of Placental Hormones in the Culture Medium—H1 cells were cultured in CM with or without SB431542 for 12 days, and the medium was changed every day. The conditioned medium was collected daily from days 2 to 12. The hCG concentration was analyzed using a hCG ELISA kit (RECI), which specifically reacts with CG-β. The concentration of estradiol and progesterone were analyzed with an ELISA kit. Inhibition of Activin/Nodal Signaling in hESCs Results in Rapid Differentiation—Activin/Nodal signaling has been shown to play a key role in the maintenance of undifferentiated human ES cells (16Xiao L. Yuan X. Sharkis S.J. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17Beattie G.M. Lopez A.D. Bucay N. Hinton A. Firpo M.T. King C.C. Hayek A.

Development. 2005; 132: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). To further address the function of Activin/Nodal signaling in the developmental fate of hESCs, and to understand the early developmental mechanisms of human embryogenesis, we inhibited Activin/Nodal signaling in hESCs. Two hESCs lines, H1 and HUES-17, were used in this study, and the results obtained from these two cells lines were very similar. For this reason, only data from the H1 cells have been presented. HESCs were cultured without murine embryonic fibroblast feeder cells in CM, or CM plus different concentrations of Activin/Nodal signaling inhibitors, SB431542 or Follistatin, for 6 days; gene expression was analyzed by real-time PCR. Consistent with previous studies, the conditioned media to the culture system is sufficient for the maintenance of undifferentiated hESCs (21Xu C. Inokuma M.S. Denham J. Golds K. Kundu P. Gold J.D. Carpenter M.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). SB431542 inhibits the function of Activin receptor-like kinase receptors 4/5/7 thereby acting as a selective inhibitor of Activin/Nodal signaling, but not those of BMPs (22Laping N.J. Grygielko E. Mathur A. Butter S. Bomberger J. Tweed C. Martin W. Fornwald J. Lehr R. Harling J. Gaster L. Callahan J.F. Olson B.A. Mol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). Follistatin is an inhibitor of Activin by directly binding with Activin and preventing the assembly of an active Activin-receptor complex (24Nakamura T. Takio K. Eto Y. Shibai H. Titani K. Sugino H. Science. 1990; 247: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). When hESCs were cultured in CM supplied with SB431542, the expression levels of p-Smad2, and known downstream targets of Activin/Nodal signaling, namely Nodal, Lefty-A, and Lefty-B, were significantly inhibited (Figs. 1A and 5C). SB431542 is a very potent inhibitor of Activin/Nodal signaling; in hESCs cultured with CM plus 10 μm SB431542, the expression of Nodal, Lefty-A, and Lefty-B decreased to less than 0.1% of hESCs cultured with CM. We also determined that hESCs underwent differentiation when Activin/Nodal signaling was inhibited, because the treated cells became flattened and enlarged (Fig. 1B) and that pluripotency markers, such as Oct4, Nanog, and SSEA4 were significantly down-regulated (Fig. 1, C and D). Similar results were obtained with Follistatin as an inhibitor of Activin/Nodal signaling in hESCs as observed with SB431542 (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that and the inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling promoted differentiation of hESCs.FIGURE 5Inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling down-regulates FGF and Wnt signals, but up-regulates BMP signals. The H1 hES cells were cultured under a feeder-free condition and treated with SB431542 for 6 days. Then cells were harvested for real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of ligands of the FGF (A), Wnt (A), and BMP (B) signaling pathways and Western analysis of Oct4, Smad2, p-Smad2, Smad1, and p-Smad1 (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of Activin/Nodal Signaling in hESCs Initiates Trophoblast Differentiation—To determine lineage commitment or differentiation due to inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling, we analyzed the induction of lineage-specific marker expression. Unlike what we observed with a standard differentiation by embryoid bodies formation, we did not observe a significant up-regulation in expression of ectoderm (neurofilament heavy chain), mesoderm (cardiac actin), or endoderm (α1-antitrypsin) markers (Fig. 2A), indicating that inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling under the monolayer culture condition did not initiate differentiation of endoderm, mesoderm, or ectoderm in hESCs. However, the trophoblast marker GCM1 was specifically up-regulated (Fig. 2B), which suggests that hESCs might have differentiated into trophoblasts when Activin/Nodal signaling was inhibited. The notion of trophoblast differentiation was further supported by the up-regulation of other trophoblast markers, such as Cdx2, GATA2, Msx2, CG-α, and CG-β. CG-α and CG-β are subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is secreted by giant cells of trophoblast-derived placenta. We also analyzed another key regulator of trophoblast differentiation in mice, eomesodermin (Eomes) (25Russ A.P. Wattler S. Colledge W.H. Aparicio S.A. Carlton M.B. Pearce J.J. Barton S.C. Surani M.A. Ryan K. Nehls M.C. Wilson V. Evans M.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Although Eomes plays a key role in mouse trophoblast differentiation, it is a downstream target of Activin/Nodal signaling in mice and Xenopus (26Ryan K. Garrett N. Mitchell A. Gurdon J.B. Cell. 1996; 87: 989-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 27Brennan J. Lu C.C. Norris D.P. Rodriguez T.A. Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). We observed that Eomes showed down-regulation when Activin/Nodal was inhibited. Taken together, these data indicate that the inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling results in trophoblast differentiation in hESCs. Notably, we also observed a slight up-regulation of neuroectoderm markers, such as Nestin, Sox1, Sox3, and NGN2, when Activin/Nodal signaling was inhibited, which supports a recent article by Smith et al. (28Smith J.R. Vallier L. Lupo G. Alexander M. Harris W.A. Pedersen R.A. Dev. Biol. 2008; 313: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). We attempted to differentiate hESCs that were growing as embryoid bodies or as a monolayer; however, results were similar (supplemental Fig. S1). The differentiation of hESCs as a monolayer produced higher expressions of trophoblast markers and lower expression of other lineage markers, such as Sox3. Therefore, the data presented in this paper pertain to monolayer cultures, unless specifically mentioned. To understand the kinetics of trophoblast differentiation, we performed time course experiments and analyzed marker expression by real-time PCR. Results showed that inhibition constantly repressed Activin/Nodal signaling (Fig. 3A). The expression of pluripotency markers, namely Oct4 and Nanog, decreased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Cdx2 has been shown to be the key regulator of trophoblast commitment and subsequent self-renewal in mice (29Strumpf D. Mao C.A. Yamanaka Y. Ralston A. Chawengsaksophak K. Beck F. Rossant J. Development. 2005; 132: 2093-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar); inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling in hESCs initiated Cdx2 expression after 2 days, and expression rose to a peak on day 6 and decreased thereafter (Fig. 3C). Gcm1 expression was induced by inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling on day 4 and continued to increase throughout differentiation (Fig. 3C). Two additional markers that often associated with BMP activation and trophoblast commitment, GATA2 and Msx2, were also dramatically up-regulated and reached a peak level at day 10 (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, CG-α and CG-β expression significantly increased at day 6 and reached a surprisingly high level on day 12 (Fig. 3C). Eomes decreased during trophoblast differentiation of hESCs (Fig. 3C), which suggests that Eomes might be dispensable in trophoblast differentiation of hESCs. The transient expression of Cdx2 suggests that its function could be to induce Gcm1 and other trophoblast transcriptional factors, and the down-regulation of Cdx2 might allow for further trophoblast maturation. Although the hESC is the only available model thus far for studying human embryonic development, the human ES cell model may not entirely reflect embryonic development in vivo. To explore this, we tested the in vivo effects of SB431542 in mouse embryos. The 8-cell stage mouse embryos were cultured with 10 μm SB431542 for 3 days. No gross abnormalities were detected at 4.5 days postcoitum; the inner cell mass and trophoblast formed normally (data not shown). These observations are in accordance with previous reports, demonstrating that Activin/Nodal signaling is involved in the propagation of mouse embryonic stem cells, but is not involved in the regulation of pluripotency (18James D. Levine A.J. Besser D. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Development. 2005; 132: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 30Ogawa K. Saito A. Matsui H. Suzuki H. Ohtsuka S. Shimosato D. Morishita Y. Watabe T. Niwa H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). hESC-derived Trophoblast Cells Secrete Placental Hormones—Prolonged cultures of hESCs in CM plus SB431542 were performed (12 days); the cells continued to develop, and numerous differentiated cells contained multiple nuclei (Fig. 2C). Xu et al. (13Xu R.H. Chen X. Li D.S. Li R. Addicks G.C. Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) reported that syncytial cells were present only among individualized BMP4-treated hESCs plated at low density, whereas BMP4-treated hESC colonies form only mononuclear cells. In contrast, the present study demonstrated that the SB431542- or Follistatin-treated hESC colonies formed syncytial cells (Fig. 2C), which suggests that inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling is more efficient than BMP4 in inducing syncytial cell formation. It was not attempted to induce hESC differentiation in individual cells. To further confirm trophoblast differentiation from hESCs, the amount of placental hormones in differentiated cells was measured. Both CG-α and CG-β proteins were detected in a large percentage of differentiated hESCs after 12 days treatment with SB431542 or Follistatin (Fig. 4, A and B). The percentage of the CG-α-expressing cells was 74 ± 5% (n = 3) when Activin/Nodal signaling was inhibited by 10 μm SB431542, and 66 ± 3% (n = 3) when Activin/Nodal signaling was inhibited by Follistatin, respectively. In addition, during hESC differentiation, the placental hormones, hCG (consisting both a and b subunits), estradiol, and progesterone, were secreted in the supernatant in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Inhibition of Activin/Nodal Signaling Down-regulates FGF and Wnt Signals, but Up-regulates BMP Signals—FGF signaling has been shown to be important in the maintenance of hESC pluripotency (31Xu C. Rosler E. Jiang J. Lebkowski J.S. Gold J.D. O'Sullivan C. Delavan-Boorsma K. Mok M. Bronstein A. Carpenter M.K. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 32Xu R.H. Peck R.M. Li D.S. Feng X. Ludwig T. Thomson J.A. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), and Wnt signaling has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of hESCs (33Dravid G. Ye Z. Hammond H. Chen G. Pyle A. Donovan P. Yu X. Cheng L. Stem Cells. 2005; 23: 1489-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 34Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 35Cai L. Ye Z. Zhou B.Y. Mali P. Zhou C. Cheng L. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported that Activin/Nodal signaling up-regulates FGF and Wnt signaling in hESCs (16Xiao L. Yuan X. Sharkis S.J. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that the expression of FGF2 (Fig. 5A), FGF4 (Fig. 5A), FGF8 (Fig. 5A), and Wnt3 (Fig. 5A) was significantly repressed by the inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling, but p-Smad1 and BMP4 expression was significantly up-regulated (Fig. 5, B and C). These observations further strengthen our previous hypothesis that Activin/Nodal signaling plays a key role in the complex signaling network that maintains the hESC phenotype and function (16Xiao L. Yuan X. Sharkis S.J. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). BMP4-induced Trophoblast Differentiation Correlates with Inhibition of Activin/Nodal Signaling—As reported by Xu et al. (16Xiao L. Yuan X. Sharkis S.J. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we also observed that hESCs differentiated into trophoblasts when cultured in CM plus BMP4 (10-50 ng/ml), as evidenced by the down-regulation of pluripotency markers, such as Oct4 and Nanog (Fig. 6A), and the up-regulation of Cdx2, Gcm1, GATA2, CG-α, and CG-β (Fig. 6A). At the same time, expression of Lefty-A, Lefty-B, and Nodal was largely inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these results indicate that BMP4 was sufficient to inhibit Activin/Nodal signaling and that BMP4-induced trophoblast differentiation in hESCs correlates to the inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling. Inhibition of Activin/Nodal Signaling Is Essential for Trophoblast Differentiation—We further investigated whether inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling is essential for hESC trophoblast differentiation. hESC differentiation was induced by incubating the cells in CM supplemented with BMP4 and gradients of Activin A. Results showed that Activin A restored the expression of Lefty-A, Lefty-B, and Nodal, indicating release of the BMP inhibition effect on Activin/Nodal signaling (Fig. 6C). Activin A also significantly inhibited CG-α and CG-β expression, which was induced by BMP4 (Fig. 6D). Immunostaining methods were utilized to detect CG-α and CG-β proteins in hESCs after 6 days of treatment with 10 ng/ml BMP4, or 10 ng/ml BMP4 plus 100 ng/ml Activin A. BMP4 induced the hESCs to produce CG-α and CG-β. However, the number of CG-α- and CG-β-positive cells was reduced dramatically when Activin A was added (Fig. 6E). In addition, ELISA analyses demonstrated that Activin A significantly repressed the placental hormones, hCG, estradiol, and progesterone, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6F). Therefore, we conclude that inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling is essential for trophoblast differentiation of hESCs. BMP Activation Is Required for the Trophoblast Differentiation from hESCs—We showed that inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling induced the expression of BMP4 (Fig. 5B). It is interesting to know if the BMP4 induced by inhibition of Activin/Nodal is required for the trophoblast differentiation. We took advantage of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-AP deficient hESC line, namely AR1-C1 (37Chen G. Ye Z. Yu X. Zou J. Mali P. Brodsky R. Cheng L. Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 345-355Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The BMP signaling depends on a co-receptor, Dragon. Dragon is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-AP. In AR1-C1 hESCs, the function of Dragon is disrupted due to the lacking of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Therefore, the extracellular BMP cannot bind with the receptor well and the BMP signaling is blocked. The trophoblast development induced by BMPs in wild type hESCs (G-GFP) is blocked in AR1-C1 hESCs, evidenced by absence of the expression of trophoblast markers like CDX2, CG-a, CG-b (Fig. 7A), and Troma-1 in AR1-C1 cells (Fig. 7B). The deficiency of BMP signaling can be rescued by transfection of Dragon, which indicates that the deficiency of trophoblast development is caused by deficiency of BMP signaling, not any other signal, in the AR1-C1 cell.4 We expected that if activation of BMP signaling by BMPs was not required for trophoblast differentiation when Activin/Nodal signaling is repressed, the AR1-C1 cells would differentiate into trophoblast when Activin/Nodal signaling is repressed. If activation of BMP signaling by BMPs is required, the AR1-C1 cells would not differentiate into trophoblast when Activin/Nodal signaling is repressed. When the Ar1-C1 cells were treated with SB431542 to inhibit Activin/Nodal signaling, no evidence of trophoblast differentiation was observed (Fig. 7). Therefore, our data indicated that both inhibition of Activin/Nodal and activation of BMP signaling were required for trophoblast differentiation from hESCs. The first cell lineage segregation in human embryonic development takes place at the blastocyst stage, when the trophoblast segregates from the inner cell mass. Due to ethical and practical reasons, it has been difficult to determine the key signals in this event (1Rossant J. Cross J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). We, along with others, have previously shown that Activin/Nodal signaling maintains pluripotency of hESCs (16Xiao L. Yuan X. Sharkis S.J. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 17Beattie G.M. Lopez A.D. Bucay N. Hinton A. Firpo M.T. King C.C. Hayek A.

In the present study, it is demonstrated that hESCs develop into trophoblasts, when Activin/Nodal signaling is inhibited (Fig. 2). Based on these observations, we propose that the segregation of the trophoblast from the inner cell mass is controlled by Activin/Nodal signaling. In the human morula, the cells that receive active Activin/Nodal signals form the inner cell mass; other cells that do not receive sufficient Activin/Nodal signals develop into the trophoblast. This suggests that Activin/Nodal signaling regulates the first differentiation event of human embryonic development. Xu et al. (13Xu R.H. Chen X. Li D.S. Li R. Addicks G.C. Glennon C. Zwaka T.P. Thomson J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1261-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) showed that BMP4 is able to initiate trophoblast differentiation. To further address the mechanisms that control cell lineage segregation at the human blastocyst stage, the relation of BMP signal to inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling was investigated. Results showed that the effect of BMP4 correlates to inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling. In addition, inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling induced trophoblast differentiation (Figs. 2 and 3), whereas Activin/Nodal signaling inhibited trophoblast differentiation resulting from BMP4 signals (Fig. 6). Based on these results, we conclude that inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling is essential for trophoblast differentiation of hESCs. Our data also showed that when Activin/Nodal was repressed, BMP4 was induced. This raised the possibility that BMP4 induced by Activin/Nodal repression promotes trophoblast differentiation. We used the BMP co-receptor, Dragon, deficient hESCs (37Chen G. Ye Z. Yu X. Zou J. Mali P. Brodsky R. Cheng L. Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 345-355Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to investigate if the BMP4 induced by Activin/Nodal repression is required for trophoblast differentiation. We found that trophoblast differentiation was still blocked when Activin/Nodal was repressed. Our data suggested that BMP signaling is still required for trophoblast development even when Activin/Nodal is repressed. The observation should not be simply interpreted that they are upstream and downstream. Because trophoblast induction of BMP also depends on the inhibition of Activin/Nodal. Activin/Nodal inhibition and BMP activation form a reciprocal feedback loop. Activin/Nodal inhibition induces the expression of BMP and activates BMP signaling; BMP signaling further inhibits Activin/Nodal. Both inhibition of Activin/Nodal and activation of the BMP signal are required for trophoblast differentiation. Our observation reveals that a novel mechanism in which a critical interaction of two related but antagonizing signals by Activin/Nodal and BMP regulates the fate determination of hESCs in culture, and possibly also true for human embryo in vivo. In contrast, Smith et al. (28Smith J.R. Vallier L. Lupo G. Alexander M. Harris W.A. Pedersen R.A. Dev. Biol. 2008; 313: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) reported that inhibition of Activin/Nodal signaling promotes specification of human embryonic stem cells into neuroectoderm. We did observe a very slight up-regulation of neuroectoderm markers (supplemental Fig. S1); however, we also observed a dramatic up-regulation of trophoblast markers (Figs. 2 and 3 and supplemental Fig. S1). Because Smith et al. (28Smith J.R. Vallier L. Lupo G. Alexander M. Harris W.A. Pedersen R.A. Dev. Biol. 2008; 313: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) did not analyze trophoblast marker expression, it is likely they overlooked the dramatic differentiation of trophoblast in their experiments, which led to improper conclusions. Little is known about normal human development during the early post-implantation period. Although the mouse is the typical model for experimental mammalian embryology, early structures, including the placenta, extraembryonic membranes, and the egg cylinder, all differ substantially from the corresponding human structure. Our results display that although the most key transcriptional factors exhibit similar expression between hESCs and mouse ESCs, some genes, such as Eomes, are completely different. Eomes has been reported to be essential for trophoblast development in mice (25Russ A.P. Wattler S. Colledge W.H. Aparicio S.A. Carlton M.B. Pearce J.J. Barton S.C. Surani M.A. Ryan K. Nehls M.C. Wilson V. Evans M.J. Nature. 2000; 404: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar); however, when Activin/Nodal signaling is inhibited, causing hESCs to differentiate into trophoblasts, the expression of Eomes is down-regulated. This suggests that Eomes are not essential for human trophoblast differentiation, which might imply that there are substantial differences between mouse and human early development. Human and mouse ES cells are both blastocyst-derived; however, they are not equivalent. The mechanisms that human and mouse ES cells use to maintain “stemness” differ greatly (16Xiao L. Yuan X.

In contrast, mouse ES cells are capable of reconstituting all cell types of the body, but do not routinely exhibit a capacity for trophoblast cell differentiation (42Rossant J.

These differences highlight the fact that hESCs are a unique and irreplaceable model for studying early human developmental events. Human ES cells will be particularly valuable for studying development and function of tissues that differ between mice and humans. hESCs give rise to early human cell types that were previously almost unobtainable, which is a major advantage; however, ethical considerations, as well as the practicalities, will make it extremely difficult to validate in vitro results with in vivo significance. We demonstrate that combinatorial signals of Activin/Nodal and BMP regulate lineage segregation of early human embryo stem cells in vitro; however, a direct role for Activin/Nodal signaling in early human embryonic lineage segregation has not been demonstrated in vivo. Expression profiles, attained by analysis of EST counts at the NCBI database, shows that Activin A, Follistatin, and BMPs are all expressed in the human ovary and/or uterus, which implies their function during early development. The challenge for the future will be to determine whether Activin/Nodal and BMP signals play a role in early lineage segregation of human embryo in vivo, and to establish the key transcriptional factor pathways in human embryo trophoblast differentiation using hESCs as a model.

https://openalex.org/W2028322265,"Phosphorus is one of the essential mineral nutrients required by all living cells. Plants assimilate phosphate (Pi) from the soil, and their root systems encounter tremendous variation in Pi concentration, both temporally and spatially. Genome sequence data indicate that plant genomes contain large numbers of genes predicted to encode Pi transporters, the functions of which are largely unexplored. Here we present a comparative analysis of four very closely related Pi transporters of the PHT1 family of Medicago truncatula. Based on their sequence similarity and locations in the genome, these four genes probably arose via recent gene duplication events, and they form a small subfamily within the PHT1 family. The four genes are expressed in roots with partially overlapping but distinct spatial expression patterns, responses to Pi and expression during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. The proteins are located in the plasma membrane. Three members of the subfamily, MtPT1, MtPT2, and MtPT3, show low affinities for Pi. MtPT5 shares 84% amino acid identity with MtPT1, MtPT2, and MtPT3 but shows a high affinity for Pi with an apparent Km in yeast of 13 microm. Sequence comparisons and protein modeling suggest that amino acid residues that differ substantially between MtPT5 and the other three transporters are clustered in two regions of the protein. The data provide the first clues as to amino acid residues that impact transport activity of plant Pi transporter proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2093636220,"The polyguanine-rich DNA sequences commonly found at telomeres and in rDNA arrays have been shown to assemble into structures known as G quadruplexes, or G4 DNA, stabilized by base-stacked G quartets, an arrangement of four hydrogen-bonded guanines. G4 DNA structures are resistant to the many helicases and nucleases that process intermediates arising in the course of DNA replication and repair. The lagging strand DNA replication protein, Dna2, has demonstrated a unique localization to telomeres and a role in de novo telomere biogenesis, prompting us to study the activities of Dna2 on G4 DNA-containing substrates. We find that yeast Dna2 binds with 25-fold higher affinity to G4 DNA formed from yeast telomere repeats than to single-stranded DNA of the same sequence. Human Dna2 also binds G4 DNAs. The helicase activities of both yeast and human Dna2 are effective in unwinding G4 DNAs. On the other hand, the nuclease activities of both yeast and human Dna2 are attenuated by the formation of G4 DNA, with the extent of inhibition depending on the topology of the G4 structure. This inhibition can be overcome by replication protein A. Replication protein A is known to stimulate the 5'- to 3'-nuclease activity of Dna2; however, we go on to show that this same protein inhibits the 3'- to 5'-exo/endonuclease activity of Dna2. These observations are discussed in terms of possible roles for Dna2 in resolving G4 secondary structures that arise during Okazaki fragment processing and telomere lengthening."

Resolution of the x-ray structure of human MAp19 has allowed identification of a Ca2+-binding site in module CUB1, and site-directed mutagenesis has provided evidence that this underlies the binding site for MBL and L-ficolin (20Gregory L.A.

The x-ray structure of the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 segment of rat MASP-2 was also solved, but in contrast no Ca2+ ion could be observed in the CUB modules, and therefore a different model for interaction with MBL was proposed (22Feinberg H.

We now report the crystal structure of the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domain of human MASP-1/3. The homodimeric structure is similar to that described for the homologous rat MASP-2 domain but holds a Ca2+-binding site in each CUB1 and CUB2 module. In line with our previous studies on MAp19 (20Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Matsushita M. Sorensen R. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29391-29397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we provide evidence that each of these sites is involved in the interaction with MBL and the ficolins and propose a schematic model of a MBL·MASP complex. Proteins—MBL was purified from human serum as described by Zundel et al. (19Zundel S. Cseh S. Lacroix M. Dahl M.R. Matsushita M. Andrieu J.-P. Schwaeble W.J. Jensenius J.C. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The CUB1-EGF-CUB2 segment of human MASP-1/3 was expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system and purified as described previously (18Cseh S. Vera L. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5735-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Full-length wild-type MASP-3 and its variants were expressed in a baculovirus/insect cell system (19Zundel S. Cseh S. Lacroix M. Dahl M.R. Matsushita M. Andrieu J.-P. Schwaeble W.J. Jensenius J.C. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All mutants were secreted in the culture medium, with yields of 8-10 μg/ml, similar to those obtained for the wild-type form, except E216A and D226A, which were produced at 1 and 5 μg/ml, respectively. All MASP-3 variants were purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) followed by high pressure gel permeation on a TSK G3000 SWG column (Toso Haas), as described previously (25Teillet F. Lacroix M. Thiel S. Weilguny D. Agger T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5710-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This latter step allowed us to check that all MASP-3 variants retained the ability to associate as homodimers. The concentrations of purified proteins were determined using absorption coefficients (A1%, 1 cm at 280 nm) calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar) and molecular weights determined by mass spectrometry, as follows: MASP-1/3 CUB1-EGF-CUB2, 10.0 and 34,200 (18Cseh S. Vera L. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5735-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); MBL, 7.6 and 25,340 (29Teillet F. Dublet B. Andrieu J.-P. Gaboriaud C.

Expression and Purification of H-ficolin—A DNA segment encoding the H-ficolin signal peptide plus the mature protein (amino acid residues 1-276) was amplified by PCR using the pGEM-T easy plasmid containing the full-length cDNA (30Matsushita M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2448-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) as a template, according to established procedures. The amplified H-ficolin DNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) mammalian expression plasmid (Invitrogen). A stable CHO K1 cell line expressing H-ficolin was created using Geneticin (G418 sulfate, Invitrogen), and the recombinant protein was produced in serum-free medium as described by Teillet et al. (25Teillet F. Lacroix M. Thiel S. Weilguny D. Agger T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5710-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recombinant H-ficolin was purified from the culture supernatant by ion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.0, using a linear NaCl gradient to 250 mm. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were identified by Western blot analysis, dialyzed against 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and further purified by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in the same buffer. Purification of L-ficolin—L-ficolin was purified from human plasma as described by Krarup et al. (31Krarup A. Thiel S. Hansen A. Fujita T. Jensenius J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47513-47519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) with modifications of the affinity chromatography step, as follows. The 4-8% PEG pellet was dissolved in 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm NaN3, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.01% (v/v) emulfogen (Sigma), pH 7.4, and loaded onto an N-acetylcysteine-Sepharose column equilibrated in the same buffer. After washing with (i) the loading buffer, (ii) the loading buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 10 mm EDTA instead of CaCl2, and (iii) the loading buffer containing 20 mm NaCl and 10 mm EDTA, bound L-ficolin was eluted with 200 mm NaCl, 0.3 m N-acetylglucosamine, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, before further purification by anion-exchange chromatography. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The expression plasmids coding for all MASP-3 mutants were generated using the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pFastBac1/MASP-3 expression plasmid (19Zundel S. Cseh S. Lacroix M. Dahl M.R. Matsushita M. Andrieu J.-P. Schwaeble W.J. Jensenius J.C. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4342-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was used as a template. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG-Biotec (Courtaboeuf, France). The sequences of all mutants were checked by double-stranded DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). Mass Spectrometry—Analyses were performed using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization technique on a Voyager Elite XL instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) under conditions described previously (32Lacroix M. Rossi V. Gaboriaud C. Chevallier S. Jaquinod M. Thielens N.M. Gagnon J. Arlaud G.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6270-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—The MASP-1/3 CUB1-EGF-CUB2 segment was concentrated to 3.6 mg/ml in 100 mm nondetergent sulfobetain 195, 145 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.4. Crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction data collection were obtained at 20 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution and of a reservoir solution composed of 18-20% (w/v) PEG 8000, 3% glycerol, and 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.0. They were transferred to a cryoprotecting solution containing 22% (w/v) PEG 8000, 20% glycerol, and 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.0, and then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. A native data set indexed in the space group C2221 was measured at the ESRF beamline ID14-eh1 to a resolution of 2.30 Å. The images were processed and the reflections scaled using the XDS program (33Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3240) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of CUB1-EGF-CUB2 was determined using the molecular replacement method. The rotational and translational searches were carried out using the program AMoRe (34Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Although initial searches using the human Map19 CUB1-EGF structure (20Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Matsushita M. Sorensen R. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29391-29397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful, a clear solution was obtained using the rat MASP-2 CUB1-EGF-CUB2 structure in its dimeric form (Protein Data Bank accession code 1NT0) (22Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weiss W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement with the program CNS (35Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16978) Google Scholar) was used to further improve the orientation and position of each domain of the search model. Several replacements corresponding to the MASP1/3 sequence were clearly seen in the electron density map and introduced in the model using the graphics program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). However, the quality of the map remained unsatisfactory in one of the CUB1 modules, because of a positioning error of its β-barrel, each strand being shifted onto the next one. The correct module orientation was obtained using strong noncrystallographic restraints in the model refinement carried out with CNS (35Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16978) Google Scholar). This essential improvement allowed 489 residues (93% of the model) to be built automatically into the electron density map after two rounds of the ARP-Warp procedure (37Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), providing clear indication of the quality of the map obtained at this stage. A new model, free from any bias arising from the initial molecular replacement model, was thus obtained. Additional model rebuilding and refinement were then carried out. The final stages of the refinement were performed with Ref-mac5 (38Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13908) Google Scholar), using TLS refinement. The quality of the map allowed construction of 530 residues out of a total of 554 in the asymmetric unit. Proline residues at positions 17, 183, and 238 are in the cis conformation. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the code 3DEM. Modeling of the Interaction between MASP-1/3 CUB1-EGF-CUB2 and MBL—The homotrimeric collagen-like segment of human MBL containing the putative MASP interaction site (25Teillet F. Lacroix M. Thiel S. Weilguny D. Agger T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5710-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was modeled on the basis of published statistical information derived from collagen-like structures, as described previously (20Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Matsushita M. Sorensen R. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29391-29397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Four MBL collagen-like segments were docked manually onto the MASP-1/3 CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domain using the interactive graphics program O (36Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), with at least one of the three Lys55 residues of each segment pointing toward a CUB1-EGF-CUB2-binding site. The fact that the MBL collagen-like fibers converge to the same point on their N-terminal side was used as an additional constraint. The x-ray structure of the zymogen CCP1-CCP2-SP segment of human MASP-2 (39Gal P. Harmat V. Kocsis A. Bian T. Barna L. Ambrus G. Vegh B. Balczer J. Sim R.B. Naray-Szabo G. Zavodszky P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33435-33444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was used as a template for constructing the schematic MBL/MASP model depicted in Fig. 7. Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy—Analyses were performed using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare). MBL and ficolins L and H were immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) using the amine coupling chemistry as described previously (18Cseh S. Vera L. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5735-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Binding of the MASP-3 variants was measured over 19,300-23,000 resonance units of immobilized L-ficolin, 19,600-21,900 resonance units of H-ficolin, and 7,800-8,000 resonance units of MBL, at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in 145 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% surfactant P20 (GE Healthcare). Binding to MBL was measured in the presence of 10 mm mannose to prevent unwanted interaction between the oligomannose-type N-linked oligosaccharides of MASP-3 and the lectin domain of MBL (25Teillet F. Lacroix M. Thiel S. Weilguny D. Agger T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5710-5716Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Equivalent volumes of each MASP-3 sample were injected in parallel over a surface with immobilized bovine serum albumin to serve as blank sensorgrams for subtraction of the bulk refractive index background. Regeneration of the surfaces was achieved by injection of 10 μl of 1 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA. Data were analyzed by global fitting to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model of both the association and dissociation phases for several concentrations simultaneously, using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software (GE Healthcare). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were calculated from the ratio of the dissociation and association rate constants (koff/kon). Each MASP-3 variant was analyzed at six different concentrations, ranging from 10 to 250 nm. Overall Structure—The N-terminal CUB1-EGF-CUB2 interaction domain of human MASP-1/3 (amino acids 1-278 of the mature proteins) was produced in a baculovirus/insect cell expression system as described previously (18Cseh S. Vera L. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5735-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analysis of the recombinant protein yielded a value of 34,238 ± 27 Da, accounting for the unmodified polypeptide chain (calculated value, 31,973 Da) plus the two N-linked oligosaccharides at positions 30 and 159 (total deduced mass, 2,265 ± 27 Da). The x-ray structure was solved by molecular replacement using the rat MASP-2 CUB1-EGF-CUB2 structure (22Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weiss W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as a search model, and refined to 2.30-Å resolution. The final Rwork and Rfree factors are 0.22 and 0.24, respectively, and the refined model has good stereochemistry (Table 1). As anticipated from previous ultracentrifugation analyses (17Thielens N.M. Cseh S. Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Rossi V. Jensenius J.C. Arlaud G.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5068-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 segment associates as a Ca2+-dependent homodimer (Fig. 1). The monomers have a curved shape, with the CUB1, EGF, and CUB2 modules arranged end-to-end. Each monomer contains three Ca2+ ions, one at each CUB1-EGF interface (site I) and one bound to one end of the CUB1 and CUB2 modules (sites II and III, respectively). The dimer has a head-to-tail structure, involving interactions between the CUB1 module of one monomer and the EGF module of its counterpart (Fig. 1A), i.e. a configuration corresponding to the compact dimer observed by Feinberg et al. (22Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weiss W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The dimer displays noncrystallographic pseudo 2-fold symmetry and has approximate dimensions 135 Å (distance between the CUB2 modules tips) × 87 Å (distance between the CUB1 modules tips) × 25 Å (mean thickness). On a side view (Fig. 1B), the overall shape of the dimer is rather flat, the six modules as well as the Ca2+ ions bound to sites II and III being roughly located in the same plane. In contrast with human MAp19 (20Gregory L.A. Thielens N.M. Matsushita M. Sorensen R. Arlaud G.J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Gaboriaud C. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2051198139,"WFIKKN1 and WFIKKN2 are large extracellular multidomain proteins consisting of a WAP, a follistatin, an immunoglobulin, two Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains, and an NTR domain. Recent experiments have shown that WFIKKN2 protein binds mature GDF8/myostatin and myostatin propeptide and inhibits the biological activity of myostatin (Hill, J. J., Qiu, Y., Hewick, R. M., and Wolfman, N. M. (2003) Mol. Endocrinol. 17, 1144-1154). Here we show that the paralogue of this protein, WFIKKN1, also binds to both myostatin and myostatin propeptide and that both WFIKKN1 and WFIKKN2 bind GDF11, the growth and differentiation factor most closely related to myostatin, with high affinity. Structure-function studies on WFIKKN1 have revealed that the follistatin domain is primarily responsible for the binding of mature growth factor, whereas the NTR domain contributes most significantly to the interaction with myostatin propeptide. Analysis of the evolutionary histories of WFIKKN1/WFIKKN2 and GDF8/GDF11 proteins indicates that the functional association of an ancestral WFIKKN protein with an ancestor of GDF8/11 may date back to cephalochordates/urochordates. Although duplication of the corresponding genes gave rise to WFIKKN1/WFIKKN2 and GDF8/GDF11 in early vertebrates, the data presented here suggest that there is significant functional overlap of the paralogous proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1996296667,"Werner syndrome is an inherited disease displaying a premature aging phenotype. The gene mutated in Werner syndrome encodes both a 3′ → 5′ DNA helicase and a 3′ → 5′ DNA exonuclease. Both WRN helicase and exonuclease preferentially utilize DNA substrates containing alternate secondary structures. By virtue of its ability to resolve such DNA structures, WRN is postulated to prevent the stalling and collapse of replication forks that encounter damaged DNA. Using electron microscopy, we visualized the binding of full-length WRN to DNA templates containing replication forks and Holliday junctions, intermediates observed during DNA replication and recombination, respectively. We show that both wild-type WRN and a helicase-defective mutant bind with exceptionally high specificity (>1000-fold) to DNA secondary structures at the replication fork and at Holliday junctions. Little or no binding is observed elsewhere on the DNA molecules. Calculations of the molecular weight of full-length WRN revealed that, in solution, WRN exists predominantly as a dimer. However, WRN bound to DNA is larger; the mass is consistent with that of a tetramer. Werner syndrome is an inherited disease displaying a premature aging phenotype.

Helicases are motor proteins that utilize the energy derived from nucleotide hydrolysis to disrupt double-stranded or multistranded nucleic acids. Their importance can be gleaned from the following facts: (a) human cells possess up to 25 DNA helicases (1Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1835-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and perhaps an equal number of RNA helicases; (b) they are essential for numerous cellular transactions, including DNA replication, repair, and recombination, as well as RNA transcription, maturation, and translation. Helicases are recognized by the presence of conserved signature sequence motifs. All helicases possess sequences homologous to the Walker A and B boxes that are characteristic of NTP binding and/or hydrolyzing enzymes (2Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). They do not display sequence specificity for unwinding, but exhibit preference for the type and structure of the nucleic acid substrate, and can be classified as those that preferentially unwind DNA or RNA. DNA helicases facilitate strand separation either passively, by binding and trapping ssDNA 2The abbreviations used are:sssingle-strandedATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). 2The abbreviations used are:sssingle-strandedATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). that arises during transient breathing of paired DNA, or by an active mode wherein they actively destabilize paired DNA in addition to binding the released ssDNA (2Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 23-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Unwinding is generally directional, proceeding either 3′ → 5′ or 5′ → 3′ on the translocating strand. single-stranded adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). single-stranded adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). The Werner syndrome protein belongs to the RecQ family of evolutionarily conserved 3′ → 5′ DNA helicases (3Ozgenc A. Loeb L.A. Mutat. Res. 2005; 577: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The prototype of this family is Escherichia coli RecQ. Prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes generally have one RecQ member; however, higher eukaryotes possess multiple members. For example, five homologs, designated RecQ1 or RecQL, RecQ2 or BLM, RecQ3 or WRN, RecQ4 or RTS, and RecQ5a/b, have been identified in human cells. All RecQ members share a conserved helicase core and one or two additional C-terminal domains, the RQC (RecQ C-terminal) and HRDC (helicase and RNaseD C-terminal) domains. These domains bind, respectively, proteins and DNA. Eukaryotic RecQ helicases have, in addition, further N- and C-terminal extensions that are involved in protein-protein interactions and postulated to lend unique functional characteristics to each helicase (see Refs. 4Hanada K. Hickson I.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2306-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. DNA Helicases and Human Disease. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2006: 435-460Google Scholar and references therein for a summary of RecQ helicases). RecQ DNA helicases are noteworthy for several reasons. 1) In addition to unwinding duplex DNA, they unwind DNA containing noncanonical structures such as forks, bubbles, Holliday junctions/D-loops, and tetraplexes (6Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 7Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). In fact, in many instances, they prefer these substrates to standard duplex DNA. 2) Mutations in three RecQ helicases, BLM, WRN, and RTS, are manifested by the rare genomic instability disorders, Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome/RAPADILINO/Baller-Gerold syndrome, respectively (4Hanada K. Hickson I.D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2306-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Werner syndrome, for example, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by features of premature aging and a high incidence of uncommon cancers (3Ozgenc A. Loeb L.A. Mutat. Res. 2005; 577: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The fact that these disorders are rare emphasizes the importance of these helicases in cellular metabolism. The emerging hypothesis is that RecQ helicases, by virtue of their ability to resolve alternate DNA structures, prevent the stalling and collapse of replication forks that encounter damaged DNA and thus help in maintaining genome integrity (8Wu L. DNA Repair. 2007; 6: 936-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). WRN is a unique member of the RecQ helicase family. In addition to exhibiting unwinding activity, WRN also encodes a 3′ → 5′ DNA exonuclease (9Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). WRN exonuclease excises 3′-terminal single mismatches but does not degrade ssDNA (10Kamath-Loeb A.S. Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Fry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34145-34150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and similar to the helicase, WRN exonuclease hydrolyzes noncanonical DNA substrates (11Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3260-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The overlapping substrate preference suggests that the helicase and exonuclease may function coordinately; in fact, this has been reported to occur with a model DNA replication fork structure in vitro (12Opresko P.L. Laine J.P. Brosh Jr., R.M. Seidman M.M. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44677-44687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the opposing polarity of the helicase and exonuclease activities raises questions on how this might occur mechanistically. In this study, we present initial studies on the visualization of WRN binding to model DNA substrates encountered during DNA replication and recombination by electron microscopy (EM). We show that WRN binds at the junction of a replication fork and at Holliday junction structures. Moreover, binding to junction DNA is highly specific because little or no WRN binding is visualized at other sites along these substrates. Furthermore, using apoferritin as a size reference, EM analyses reveal that full-length WRN is predominantly a dimer in solution. However, WRN assembles into a larger complex composed of four monomers upon binding to DNA, consistent with the quaternary structure of WRN being a tetramer. Wild-type and K577M WRN Purification—WRN was purified as described by successive steps of DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, and Ni2+-affinity chromatography (9Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34139-34144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The purified protein exhibits both 3′ → 5′ DNA helicase and exonuclease activities and was visualized as a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of ∼165 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Purified WRN was stored at –80 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Igepal CA-630, 25% glycerol, 250 mm imidazole, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), or the same buffer lacking bovine serum albumin. DNA Templates—Replication forks and Holliday junctions were synthesized as described previously (13Lee S. Elenbaas B. Levine A. Griffith J. Cell. 1995; 81: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 14Subramanian D. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42568-42572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Holliday junction was synthesized by annealing four oligonucleotides together resulting in a small four-way Holliday junction with AGCC-3′ overhangs. These junctions were transformed into larger Holliday junction templates suitable for visualization with EM by ligation of four 575-bp double strand DNA arms onto the junction. Templates containing all four arms, referred to as Holliday junction, were gel-purified prior to use in binding reactions. Replication fork templates were prepared from a 3.4-kb circular DNA template containing a G-less cassette with a nick site at one end. The construct was nicked with N.BbvCIA followed by strand displacement with Klenow (exo-) in the absence of dCTP. This resulted in a circular template with a 400-bp single strand arm. A primer was annealed to the 3′ end of the displaced single strand arm, and the complementary strand was extended by Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, resulting in a 3.4-kb circular template with a 400-bp double strand arm. Protein-DNA Binding Reactions and Preparation of Samples for EM—Wild-type or K577M WRN (0.8 μg/ml) was incubated with DNA (3 μg/ml) on ice in 30 μl of binding buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATPγS for 20 min. Protein-DNA complexes were fixed with 0.6% glutaraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature; excess glutaraldehyde and binding buffer components were removed by chromatography through a 2-ml column of 2% agarose beads (Agarose Bead Technology, Colna, Portugal) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 0.1 mm EDTA. Samples of WRN or apoferritin (used as a size marker) were prepared for EM by dilution to 10 μg/ml in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) buffer; 1 μl of this dilution was mixed with 1 μl of 1.2% glutaraldehyde. Following 10 min of incubation at 0 °C, the sample was further diluted by addition of 8 μl of water. Preparation for EM followed promptly. Electron Microscopy—Cross-linked free or DNA-bound protein samples were individually mixed with a buffer containing 2.5 mm spermidine and incubated on glow-charged carbon foil grids for 3 min (15Griffith J.D. Christiansen G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For each shadowcasting, an apoferritin standard was prepared side-by-side. Samples were washed with a series of water/ethanol washes, air-dried, and rotary shadowcast with tungsten at 1 × 10–6 torr. Samples were analyzed using an FEI Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (FEI Inc., Hillsboro, OR) at 40 kV, and images were captured on a Gatan Ultrascan 4000 slow-scan CCD camera and supporting software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Size analysis was performed with ImageQuant 5.1 software (GE Healthcare). Image size and contrast were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA). Further image manipulations were performed using Corel Photo Paint version 12 (Fremont, CA). Mass Analysis by Electron Microscopy—Using EM, fields of free or DNA-bound proteins were captured on digital micrographs. The projected protein surface areas were measured using ImageQuant 5.1 software. The numbers of particles traced for size analysis of each sample are given in Table 1. All measured areas were normalized to the same magnification and resolution by using Microsoft Excel 2007 (Redmond, CA).TABLE 1Number of particles traced for size analysisSampleNo. of particles analyzedFree WRN WT-WRN200 K577M-WRN123 Apoferritin139DNA-bound WRN WT-WRN: RF20 K577M-WRN: RF43 WT-WRN: HJ28 K577M-WRN: HJ16 Open table in a new tab To determine molecular weights of free and DNA-bound WRN, projected areas measured by ImageQuant were transferred into GraphPad Prism version 5. In addition to calculating the means and medians of these areas, a histogram of each data set was built and fitted with a Gaussian distribution equation to determine the peak values (see supplemental Fig. 1). We further calculated the means ± S.E. for the projected areas and determined the 95% confidence intervals for each Gaussian peak value. Finally, using apoferritin as the standard, and Equation 1,Mr,sample/Mr,standard=(projectedareasample/projectedareastandard)3/2(Eq. 1) the projected areas of the samples were converted to molecular masses in kDa (16Griffith J.D. Makhov A. Zawel L. Reinberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular masses were similar when the peak projected area from the Gaussian curve or the median and mean projected areas were used. Therefore, for simplicity, we only report the molecular weights calculated from the projected area from the peak of the Gaussian curve (Table 2). Yet, although determining the actual oligomeric state of free and bound WRN and K577M WRN, molecular weights from means and medians were also taken into consideration.TABLE 2Oligomeric states of free and DNA-bound WT-WRNSampleProjected areaCalculated Mr95% confidence intervals for MrEstimated oligomeric StatePixelsWT-WRN (free)2392301294-307DimerWT-WRN bound to RF4103577515-641TetramerWT-WRN bound to HJ4097576561-590Tetramer Open table in a new tab Visualization of WRN Binding to DNA Containing Alternate Secondary Structures—The binding and localization of WRN on DNAs containing replication forks and Holliday junctions were visualized by electron microscopy. WRN was incubated with DNA, fixed, and adsorbed onto carbon-supporting grids, and then shadowcast with tungsten (Fig. 1A). We observed that WRN bound specifically to the 4-way junction in the Holliday junction DNAs. Scoring 359 DNA molecules at random (three independent experiments) revealed that 35 ± 12% of the DNA molecules contained WRN protein localized at the 4-way junction. The remaining DNA molecules either contained WRN bound at sites other than the 4-way junction, for example, along the DNA arms or at the DNA ends (4 ± 4%), or lacked protein (61 ± 12%) (Fig. 3A). Thus, of the protein-bound fraction, 89 ± 5% of the DNA molecules contained WRN at the 4-way junction. These data indicate a remarkably high preference of WRN for binding alternate secondary structures relative to the much longer regions of duplex B-form DNA.FIGURE 3Quantitative analysis of WRN binding to Holliday junctions and replication forks. Large numbers of DNA molecules were surveyed to determine protein-free and protein-bound fractions. The protein-bound fractions were scored for specific and nonspecific binding (defined respectively, as junction binding or binding elsewhere on the DNA). A and C, percent Holliday junction molecules bound by wild-type (n = 359) and K577M-WRN (n = 527), respectively. B and D, percent replication forks bound by wild-type (n = 230) and K577M-WRN (n = 237), respectively. Error bars represent ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As observed with the Holliday junction DNA template, the binding of WRN to large replication fork templates also showed a high specificity for the fork junction. Of 230 protein-DNA complexes scored in two independent experiments, 45 ± 9% of the DNA templates showed WRN bound at the replication fork junction (Fig. 2A and Fig. 3B). The remaining DNA molecules either contained WRN bound to the DNA arms or along the circular portion of the DNA template (9 ± 3%) or had no protein bound (46 ± 12%) (Fig. 3B). This corresponds to 83 ± 19% of the protein-DNA complexes containing WRN specifically at the fork junction. Given the large number of potential DNA-binding sites for WRN on both of these DNA templates, the binding specificity for replication fork and Holliday junctions is highly significant. Binding of Helicase-defective, K577M WRN to Holliday Junctions and Replication Forks—K577M WRN is a single amino acid variant that lacks helicase activity; this substitution, however, does not abolish its exonuclease activity or alter its ability to bind DNA (17Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Analysis of binding and localization of the mutant protein to the DNA templates by EM confirmed this observation. K577M WRN, like wild-type WRN, was also observed to bind as a large protein complex with an exceptionally high preference for the 4-way junction (Fig. 1B); 93 ± 13% of protein-DNA complexes contained K577M WRN at the 4-way junction. Overall 49 ± 10% of DNA contained a WRN complex at the 4-way junction (n = 257, two independent experiments) (Fig. 3C). The remaining DNA molecules were free of protein (47 ± 11%) or contained WRN bound at other sites on the DNA template (4 ± 2%) (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained with the replication fork template, with 68 ± 19% of protein-bound DNA templates containing K577M WRN at the fork junction (Figs. 2 and 3). Overall, 54 ± 5% of the templates showed a large WRN complex at the fork junction; 8 ± 2% showed protein bound elsewhere on the DNA template, and 38 ± 7% of the DNA was protein-free (n = 237; two independent experiments) (Fig. 3). Mass Analysis of WRN in Solution and Bound to DNA—The ability to clearly visualize WRN by EM allowed us to determine the mass and oligomeric state of WRN, either free in solution or bound to replication fork and Holliday junction DNA templates. The fact that EM requires nanogram amounts of protein circumvents the inability to produce sufficient quantities of full-length WRN protein required for more traditional methods of mass analysis, i.e. ultracentrifugation. As in most molecular mass determination methods, mass analysis by EM assumes that WRN is a globular protein. In this study, we utilized apoferritin, a large, stable globular protein complex with a mass of 443 kDa (Fig. 4K), because WRN is visually similar in size and shape to apoferritin (Fig. 4), i.e. globular without any central “holes” indicative of a donut shape protein. We can use the projected area of apoferritin to predict the mass of WRN free in solution and bound to DNA. This approach has been utilized previously to determine the oligomeric states of other DNA-binding proteins by this laboratory (16Griffith J.D. Makhov A. Zawel L. Reinberg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 19Bianchi A. Smith S. Chong L. Elias P. de Lange T.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9624-9631Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Apoferritin standards were cross-linked in parallel and mounted with WRN samples on separate EM grids followed by side-by-side shadowcasting. This controls for differences in metal shadowcasting and fixation of samples. Following EM imaging, digital image analysis was carried out to measure projected areas of apoferritin and WRN particles (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 1). Using the molecular size of apoferritin as a reference, projected areas of WRN were converted to molecular weights; the calculated molecular sizes were used to estimate the oligomeric form of WRN (Table 2 and “Experimental Procedures”).FIGURE 5Distribution of WT-WRN and K577M-WRN areas measured by EM. Projected areas of free and DNA-bound wild-type and K577M-WRN and apoferritin were calculated from EM images as described under “Experimental Procedures.” RF and HJ refer to replication fork DNA and Holliday junction DNA, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The projected area of WRN in solution, 2392 pixels, translates to a calculated molecular mass of 301 kDa. Assuming that WRN, like apoferritin, is a globular protein, the molecular mass is ∼2-fold greater than that of a WRN monomer, suggesting that free WRN is most likely a dimer (see Table 2 for confidence intervals). On the other hand, the projected area of WRN bound to either Holliday junction or replication fork DNA is 4097 and 4103 pixels, respectively. Therefore, the calculated mass of WRN bound to Holliday junction DNA is 576 kDa and the replication fork DNA is 577 kDa, which are four times greater than that of monomeric WRN. It should be noted that these latter estimates include a small amount of mass associated with the DNA bound within the WRN particles. This can be expected to add some, but not a significant, amount of additional mass to these estimates. These values are consistent with the quaternary structure of DNA-bound WRN being a tetramer (Table 2). Our analysis of the oligomerization state of K577M WRN, however, did not reveal distinct multimeric forms like wild-type WRN. Free K577M WRN appears to be in equilibrium between dimeric and trimeric forms, and DNA-bound K577M may be a trimer-tetramer equilibrium (Fig. 5). Therefore, a single Lys → Met amino acid substitution could alter the oligomerization state, or could change the shape of WRN, resulting in different calculated masses than wild-type WRN. Importantly, there is a clear increase in the multimeric state of DNA-bound WRN and K577M WRN relative to its unbound form. We report our findings on the localization of WRN on model DNA substrates, including replication forks and Holliday junctions, by electron microscopy. Both substrates contain single strand-double strand DNA junctions that are resolved by WRN helicase and exonuclease (7Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 11Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3260-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We show that WRN binds at the junction of a replication fork and at the intersection of the four duplex DNA arms in the Holliday junction substrate. The binding shows exceptionally high specificity for structured DNA as little or no WRN localizes to other regions on these DNA substrates. Of note, the Holliday junction DNA substrate comprises four 575-bp DNA duplexes, and the replication fork is created within a 3.4-kb circular, duplex DNA. There are large numbers of potential sites available for DNA binding by WRN, yet >80% of protein-bound DNA templates have WRN bound selectively at junction structures. This translates to a >1000-fold preference of WRN for binding alternate secondary structures. A helicase-deficient variant of WRN, K577M, also exhibits similar preferential binding to junction DNA, indicating that DNA substrate binding preference is independent of unwinding activity. Binding of WRN and other RecQ helicases to alternate DNA structures has been demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (11Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3260-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Competitive inhibition studies using electrophoretic mobility shift assays have yielded Kd values in the nanomolar range for binding to structured DNA (21Huber M.D. Lee D.C. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3954-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, visualization of binding by EM has thus far been lacking. The EM images in this study provide a first look at DNA binding by a full-length RecQ helicase. They reveal that WRN recognizes and binds predominantly to structured components of DNA substrates, rather than being localized at duplex regions or at free ends. The directionality of WRN helicase and WRN exonuclease on duplex B-form DNA necessitates the requirement for a 3′-tail and a 3′-recessed end, respectively. Neither unwinding nor exonucleolytic degradation can occur on blunt-ended duplex DNA. However, the presence of single-strandedness in the form of nicks, gaps, or alternate secondary structures (such as those present in the substrates analyzed) within blunt-ended double strand DNA promotes both helicase and exonuclease activities (7Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 11Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3260-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). How then, for example, does WRN bound at a 4-way junction exonucleolytically digest DNA at 3′ ends? It is conceivable that the DNA assumes a folded conformation rendering the ends accessible to junction-bound WRN. Although we did not observe looping of DNA ends into the junctions, this could occur in vivo through the interaction of WRN with one or more proteins and/or following ATP hydrolysis. Alternatively, if the junction is closely apposed to the ends, one of the DNA-bound subunits of WRN (see below) could directly contact the 3′ terminus and catalyze its degradation. Likewise, unwinding could initiate internally and proceed in a manner distinct from that believed to occur on canonical B-form duplex DNA. The EM analyses provide a platform for investigating alternate possibilities for the mode of action of WRN helicase and exonuclease. Previous attempts at determining the oligomeric state of full-length WRN by glycerol gradient centrifugation were equivocal because of low resolution of the procedure. The ability to visualize single molecules of WRN using amounts that are several orders of magnitude lower than required for traditional methods (e.g. size exclusion chromatography or analytical ultracentrifugation) prompted us to calculate molecular sizes using EM. In these analyses, it was apparent that the size of WRN, both in solution and bound to DNA, was larger than that expected of a globular monomeric protein. Using apoferritin as a standard, size analysis revealed that four monomers of WRN are bound to DNA, consistent with the quaternary structure being a tetramer in the DNA-bound state. Considering that wild-type WRN appears dimeric in solution, this suggests that either a change in the oligomeric state is required for, or acquired upon, DNA binding or that two dimers are needed to bind replication fork and Holliday junction DNA templates. Regardless, the oligomeric nature of WRN suggests that coordinate action of WRN helicase and exonuclease can occur via active sites residing on different monomers. Quaternary structures of RecQ DNA helicases have been reported using different approaches, including size exclusion chromatography, pre-steady state enzyme kinetics, and electron microscopy. However, the reports are conflicting. For example, E. coli RecQ was reported to be monomeric by stopped flow kinetics and biophysical techniques (22Xu H.Q. Deprez E. Zhang A.H. Tauc P. Ladjimi M.M. Brochon J.C. Auclair C. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34925-34933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Zhang X.D. Dou S.X. Xie P. Hu J.S. Wang P.Y. Xi X.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12655-12663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the observation that RecQ helicase activity is cooperative with ATP concentration, yielding a Hill coefficient of 3.3 ± 0.3, led Harmon and Kowalczykowski (24Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 232-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to postulate that the active form of RecQ must have at least three interacting ATP-binding subunits. Likewise, the RecQ helicase core of BLM was reported to be an active monomer (25Janscak P. Garcia P.L. Hamburger F. Makuta Y. Shiraishi K. Imai Y. Ikeda H. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), whereas an N-terminal fragment was shown to form hexamers and dodecamers (26Beresten S.F. Stan R. van Brabant A.J. Ye T. Naureckiene S. Ellis N.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the full-length protein in solution was visualized as tetramers and hexamers by electron microscopy (27Karow J.K. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 597-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consistent with our data that full-length WRN is multimeric, Huang et al. (28Huang S. Beresten S. Li B. Oshima J. Ellis N.A. Campisi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and Xue et al. (29Xue Y. Ratcliff G.C. Wang H. Davis-Searles P.R. Gray M.D. Erie D.A. Redinbo M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2901-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) used size exclusion chromatography to demonstrate that, in solution, an N-terminal fragment and full-length WRN, respectively, are trimeric. Furthermore, using atomic force microscopy, Xue et al. (29Xue Y. Ratcliff G.C. Wang H. Davis-Searles P.R. Gray M.D. Erie D.A. Redinbo M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2901-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that the N-terminal exonuclease domain of WRN exists in a trimer-hexamer equilibrium that shifts to hexamers upon the addition of DNA. In contrast, pre-steady state kinetic determinations have suggested that the functional unit of WRN in unwinding DNA is a monomer (30Choudhary S. Sommers J.A. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34603-34613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Some of these discrepancies can be explained by the use of partial fragments of WRN instead of the full-length protein that we employed, by differences in the approaches used by different investigators, and perhaps, by nucleotide hydrolysis or its lack thereof, as in our EM analyses. Precedence for nucleotides regulating the quaternary structure of RecQ helicases comes from a recent report that ATP destabilizes higher order multimeric forms of human RecQL (31Muzzolini L.

This raises an interesting possibility that the oligomeric form assumed by WRN could dictate whether it functions predominantly as a helicase or an exonuclease. WRN interacts with a number of proteins that participate in DNA replication and recombination (5Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. DNA Helicases and Human Disease. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2006: 435-460Google Scholar). In vivo, these interactions could also influence the equilibrium between the different oligomeric states of WRN and potentially modulate the helicase and exonuclease activities of WRN.

https://openalex.org/W2037446479,"Rad52 plays essential roles in homology-dependent double-strand break repair. Various studies have established the functions of Rad52 in Rad51-dependent and Rad51-independent repair processes. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of Rad52 in these processes remain unknown. In the present study we have identified a novel DNA binding site within Rad52 by a structure-based alanine scan mutagenesis. This site is closely aligned with the putative single-stranded DNA binding site determined previously. Mutations in this site impaired the ability of the Rad52-single-stranded DNA complex to form a ternary complex with double-stranded DNA and subsequently catalyze the formation of D-loops. We found that Rad52 introduces positive supercoils into double-stranded DNA and that the second DNA binding site is essential for this activity. Our findings suggest that Rad52 aligns two recombining DNA molecules within the first and second DNA binding sites to stimulate the homology search and strand invasion processes."
https://openalex.org/W2089782170,"Under various conditions, noxious stimuli damage mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation; however, the mechanisms by which fragmented mitochondria are eliminated from the cells remain largely unknown. Here we show that cytoplasmic vacuoles originating from the plasma membrane engulfed fragmented mitochondria and subsequently extruded them into the extracellular spaces in undergoing acute tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced cell death in a caspase-dependent fashion. Notably, upon fusion of the membrane encapsulating mitochondria to the plasma membrane, naked mitochondria were released into the extracellular spaces in an exocytotic manner. Mitochondrial extrusion was specific to tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced cell death, because a genotoxic stress-inducing agent such as cisplatin did not elicit mitochondrial extrusion. Moreover, intact actin and tubulin cytoskeletons were required for mitochondrial extrusion as well as membrane blebbing. Furthermore, fragmented mitochondria were engulfed by cytoplasmic vacuoles and extruded from hepatocytes of mice injected with anti-Fas antibody, suggesting that mitochondrial extrusion can be observed in vivo under pathological conditions. Mitochondria are eliminated during erythrocyte maturation under physiological conditions, and anti-mitochondrial antibody is detected in some autoimmune diseases. Thus, elucidating the mechanism underlying mitochondrial extrusion will open a novel avenue leading to better understanding of various diseases caused by mitochondrial malfunction as well as mitochondrial biology."
https://openalex.org/W2028631734,"Beta-catenin functions both as an adherens junction adhesion protein and as an essential mediator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Wnts stabilize beta-catenin and promote its accumulation in the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of the target genes. Here we show that Smad7 promotes cell-cell adhesion by stabilizing beta-catenin and consequently increases the beta-catenin-E-cadherin complex level at the plasma membrane. A Smad7-Axin interaction disassociates GSK-3beta and beta-catenin from Axin, as well as inhibits the recruitment of Smurf2, an E3 ligase, to beta-catenin, thus protecting beta-catenin from phosphorylation and degradation. Smad7 increases the stabilized beta-catenin to form a complex with E-cadherin and stabilizes the E-cadherin-beta-catenin complex. Thereby, rather than being translocated to the nucleus for regulating the target gene transcription, Smad7-stabilized-beta-catenin is shunted to the E-cadherin complex to modulate cell-cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2147968009,"The reversible oxidation of the active site cysteine in typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prx) to sulfinic acid during oxidative stress plays an important role in peroxide-mediated cell signaling. The catalytic retroreduction of Prx-SO(2)(-) by sulfiredoxin (Srx) has been proposed to proceed through two novel reaction intermediates, a sulfinic phosphoryl ester and protein-based thiosulfinate. Two scenarios for the repair mechanism have been suggested that differ in the second step of the reaction. The attack of Srx or GSH on the Prx-SO(2)PO(3)(2-) intermediate would result in either the formation of Prx-Cys-S(=O)-S-Cys-Srx or the formation of Prx-Cys-S(=O)-S-G thiosulfinates, respectively. To elucidate the mechanism of Prx repair, we monitored the reduction of human PrxII-SO(2)(-) using rapid chemical quench methodology and electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. An (18)O exchange study revealed that the Prx sulfinic acid phosphoryl ester is rapidly formed and hydrolyzed (k = 0.35 min(-1)). Furthermore, we observed the exclusive formation of a thiosulfinate linkage between Prx and Srx (k = 1.4 min(-1)) that collapses to the disulfide-bonded Srx-Prx species (k = 0.14 min(-1)). Thus, the kinetic and chemical competences of the first two steps in the Srx reaction have been demonstrated. It is clear, however, that GSH may influence thiosulfinate formation and that GSH and Srx may play additional roles in the resolution of the thiosulfinate intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2093750753,"Ferrochelatase catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX to form heme. Robust kinetic analyses of the reaction mechanism are complicated by the instability of ferrous iron in aqueous solution, particularly at alkaline pH values. At pH 7.00 the half-life for spontaneous oxidation of ferrous ion is approximately 2 min in the absence of metal complexing additives, which is sufficient for direct comparisons of alternative metal ion substrates with iron. These analyses reveal that purified recombinant ferrochelatase from both murine and yeast sources inserts not only ferrous iron but also divalent cobalt, zinc, nickel, and copper into protoporphyrin IX to form the corresponding metalloporphyrins but with considerable mechanistic variability. Ferrous iron is the preferred metal ion substrate in terms of apparent k(cat) and is also the only metal ion substrate not subject to severe substrate inhibition. Substrate inhibition occurs in the order Cu(2+) > Zn(2+) > Co(2+) > Ni(2+) and can be alleviated by the addition of metal complexing agents such as beta-mercaptoethanol or imidazole to the reaction buffer. These data indicate the presence of two catalytically significant metal ion binding sites that may coordinately regulate a selective processivity for the various potential metal ion substrates."

Its cytotoxicity toward cancer cell lines is blocked by heparin. The objective of this study was to locate the heparin binding site of ECP by site-directed mutagenesis and construction of a synthetic peptide derived from this region. Synthetic heparin with ≥5 monosaccharide units showed strong inhibition of ECP binding to the cell surface. Analysis of ECP mt1 (R34A/W35A/R36A/K38A) showed that these charged and aromatic residues were involved in ECP binding to heparin and the cell surface. A potential binding motif is located in the loop L3 region between helix α2 and strand β1, outside the RNA binding domain. The synthetic peptide derived from the loop L3 region displayed strong pentasaccharide binding affinity and blocked ECP binding to cells. In addition, ECP mt1 showed reduced cytotoxicity. Thus, the tight interaction between ECP and heparin acts as the primary step for ECP endocytosis. These results provide new insights into the structure and function of ECP for anti-asthma therapy.

It is a single polypeptide with a molecular mass ranging from 16 to 21.4 kDa due to varying degrees of glycosylation. It shows a 67% amino acid sequence identity with eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN), another eosinophil-secreted RNase. Although ECP shares the overall three-dimensional structure of RNase A, it has relatively lower RNase activity (1Boix E. Nikolovski Z. Moiseyev G.P. Rosenberg H.F. Cuchillo C.M. Nogues M.V. J. Biol.

The mechanism underlying the cytotoxic property of ECP is unclear. It has been hypothesized that ECP cytotoxicity is due to destabilization of lipid membranes of target cells (6Young J. Peterson C. Venge P. Cohn Z. Nature. 1986; 321: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), and the degree of cytotoxicity is dependent on the cellular concentration (7Carreras E. Boix E. Navarro S. Rosenberg H.F. Cuchillo C.M. Nogues M.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 272: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The binding of ECP to target cells has been attributed to its high arginine content (estimated pI = 10.8), which facilitates the interaction between ECP and negatively charged molecules on the cell surface (7Carreras E. Boix E. Navarro S. Rosenberg H.F. Cuchillo C.M. Nogues M.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 272: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Carreras E. Boix E. Rosenberg H.F. Cuchillo C.M. Nogues M.V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6636-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that binding and endocytosis of ECP into bronchial epithelial cells were greatly dependent on the cell surface glycosaminoglycan, specifically heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) (9Fan T.C. Chang H.T. Chen I.W. Wang H.Y. Chang M.D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1778-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of ECP was severely reduced toward cell lines with heparan sulfate (HS) deficiency. Heparin and HS are complex polysaccharides composed of alternating units of hexuronic acid and glucosamine. The uronic acid residues of heparin typically consist of 90% l-idopyranosyluronic acid and 10% d-glucopyranosyluronic acid (10Capila I. Linhardt R.J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 41: 391-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). The N position of glucosamine may be substituted with an acetyl or sulfate group. The 3-O and 6-O positions of glucosamine and the 2-O of uronic acid may be sulfated. Through the combination of different negatively charged moieties, heparin and HS have been demonstrated to bind a variety of proteins with diverse functions, including growth factors, thrombin, chemokines, and viral proteins. The HS chains contain domains with a high level of sulfation and epimerization (S-domains), regions with mixed N-acetylation and N-sulfation (NA/S-domains), and unmodified domains that are mostly N-acetylated and contain little sulfate (11Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Because HS chains contain heparin regions, heparin and its mimetics can be used to study interactions between proteins and polysaccharides. The structure of ECP has been determined and refined to a resolution up to 1.75 Å, displaying a folding topology that involves three α helices and five β strands (12Mallorqui-Fernandez G. Pous J. Peracaula R. Aymami J. Maeda T. Tada H. Yamada H. Seno M. Llorens R.d. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The most interesting feature is as many as 19 surface-oriented arginine residues, conferring a strong basic character to ECP. However, the heparin binding site in ECP has not been identified. Heparin binding domains within proteins usually contain a high proportion of positively charged residues, which bind to the acidic groups of heparin through electrostatic interactions. It has been proposed that the three-dimensional structure of the HS chain is critical for protein binding (13Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). However, not much is known about the three-dimensional structure of HS. After examining a series of heparin-binding protein sequences, Cardin and Weintraub (14Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the pattern XBBBXXBX or XBBXBX (where X represents hydrophobic or uncharged amino acids, and B represents basic amino acids) is responsible for HS binding to other proteins. In the present work, a linear heparin binding site on ECP and the shortest ECP-binding heparin oligosaccharide unit have been identified. Loop L3 of ECP may mediate the interaction between ECP and cell surface HSPG, contributing to ECP cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the dissociation constants between oligosaccharides and ECP were determined by tryptophan emission titration. Antibodies and Reagents—Mouse anti-maltose-binding protein (MBP) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). RNase A was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldric unless otherwise specified. Recombinant Protein Purification—Recombinant human ECP containing a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 codon plus (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI), purified by chromatography, and refolded as previously described (1Boix E. Nikolovski Z. Moiseyev G.P. Rosenberg H.F. Cuchillo C.M. Nogues M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15605-15614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues Arg-34, Trp-35, Arg-36, and Lys-38 of ECP were simultaneously substituted to alanine using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the resultant mutant was named ECP mt1. The primers used were as follows: mt1 forward, 5′-TATGCAGCGGCTTGCGCAAACCAAAAT-3′; and mt1 reverse, 5′-TTTGCGCAAGCCGCTGCATAATTGTTA-3′. E. coli BL21 codon plus (DE3) cells were used to transform various plasmids. MBP-ECP was purified using amylose affinity chromatography (1Boix E. Nikolovski Z. Moiseyev G.P. Rosenberg H.F.

Cells and Cell Culture—Beas-2B, a human bronchial epithelial cell line, was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Fluorescence-assisted Carbohydrate Electrophoresis—Synthetic heparin oligosaccharide from the degree of polymerization (dp) 3–9 (Fig. 1, Mr 926–2642) (16Lee C.J. Lu X.A. Kulkarni S.S. Wen Y.S. Hung S.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 476-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, Sigma-Aldrich, average Mr 3,000), and PI-88 (kindly provided by Progen Inc., Australia) were labeled with 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) as described previously (17Calabro A. Benavides M. Tammi M. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). AMAC-oligosaccharide and proteins were incubated at room temperature for 15 min, loaded onto 1% gels, and electrophoresed as described (18Holmes O. Pillozzi S. Deakin J.A. Carafoli F. Kemp L. Butler P.J. Lyon M. Gherardi E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cell ELISA—The ability of MBP-ECP to bind cells in the presence of serial dilutions of oligosaccharides or peptides was determined as described (9Fan T.C. Chang H.T. Chen I.W. Wang H.Y. Chang M.D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1778-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of Beas-2B cells in 96-well plates were pretreated with various concentrations of oligosaccharides or peptides in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at 4 °C for 30 min before incubation with 5 μg/ml MBP-ECP at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min prior to blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS at room temperature for 90 min. The level of bound MBP-ECP was quantified by ELISA analysis. MBP-ECP was detected using mouse monoclonal anti-MBP and goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. The amount of MBP-ECP bound to cells without oligosaccharide or peptide treatment was set to 100%. Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Emission—Binding of ECP to heparin was monitored by changes in ITFE. ECP (200 nm) in PBS at 25 °C was titrated with small aliquots of a high concentration of heparin oligosaccharides with minimal dilution (<2%). Protein fluorescence measurements were recorded 2 min after each addition on a Hitachi 8000 spectrofluorometer at emission wavelength of 340 nm using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. ΔF, the relative fluorescence change, equals F0 - Fobs, where F0 and Fobs represent the initial and observed fluorescence values, respectively. Binding constants were estimated from the titration data using a nonlinear least-squares computer fit to the equation based on 1:1 binding stoichiometry (19Venge P. Bystrom J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), ΔF=ΔFmax×([P]+[H]+Kd-(([P]+[H]+Kd)2-4×[P]×[H])1/2)/(2×[P])(Eq. 1) where ΔFmax is the maximum relative fluorescence change, P is the total concentration of ECP, H is the concentration of heparin, and Kd is the dissociation constant for the ECP-heparin interaction. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded using an Aviv model 202 CD Spectrometer equipped with a 450-watt xenon arc lamp. Far-UV spectra were recorded at 25 °C from 200 to 250 nm using a 0.1-cm cuvette containing 10 μm protein in PBS. The CD spectra were recorded at 1.5-min intervals with a bandwidth of 1 nm. Each spectrum is an average of three consecutive scans and was corrected by subtracting the buffer spectrum. Cell Growth Assay—The effect of ECP on the cell growth was determined by a colorimetric assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (US Biological, Marblehead, MA). Cells were plated in a 96-well plate (5000 cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Each sample was incubated with the indicated concentration (1–100 μm) of ECP. Forty-eight hours after treatment with ECP, MTT was added, and cell growth was monitored at A570 to measure the mitochondrial-dependent formation of a colored product. Synthetic Peptides—Human ECP peptide NYRWRCKNQNK-biotin (C1), EDN peptide NYQRRCKNQNK-biotin (D1), RNase1 peptide MTQGRCKPVNK-biotin (R1), and HIV-TAT peptide YGRKKRRQRRRK-biotin (Tat) were purchased from Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA). Immunohistochemical Staining—Adult specific-pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats (Narl:SD), with body weight of 200–300 g, were purchased and maintained at the National Laboratory Animal Center in Taiwan and heparin (FRAGMIN®, average Mr 6,000 and was 5,000 IU/0.2 ml). The rats were separated into three groups. In group 1, each rat was injected with 5 nmol of ECP through the tail vein. In group 2, each rat was co-injected with heparin (20 IU/100 g of body weight) and 5 nmol of ECP. In group 3, each rat was injected with 5 nmol of MBP as the negative control. All animals were sacrificed using CO2 narcosis 1 h after the injection of these agents. The lung and trachea of these rats were taken and immediately fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formaldehyde. The tissue samples were processed by routine methods to prepare paraffin wax-embedded block. These blocks were then sectioned into 6-μm slices. All tissue sections were examined using the Super Sensitive Non-Biotin HRP Detection System (BioGenex Laboratories, San Ramon, CA) as described (20Liang C.T. Chueh L.L. Pang V.F. Zhuo Y.X. Liang S.C. Yu C.K. Chiang H. Lee C.C. Liu C.H. J. Comp. Pathol. 2007; 136: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mouse anti-ECP or anti-MBP monoclonal antibody was used as the primary antibody. Antigen unmasking was performed by immersion of sections in 5% Trilogy (Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA) antigen unmasking solution in Milli-Q water and boiled at 121 °C. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with hydrogen peroxide (3%) in methanol. These sections were then incubated in Power Block solution, and mouse anti-ECP or anti-MBP at 1/200 dilution was applied and left for 24 h. The sections were incubated with Super Enhancer reagent, followed by Polymer-HRP reagent, and then incubated with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole chromogen solution. The sections were finally counter-stained with Mayer's hematoxylin and mounted with Super Mount permanent aqueous mounting media prior to examination with a light microscope (Axioplan, Zeiss, Germany). Oligosaccharide Length Dependence of ECP-Heparin Interaction—Previously, we demonstrated that binding and endocytosis of ECP are HSPG-dependent (9Fan T.C. Chang H.T. Chen I.W. Wang H.Y. Chang M.D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1778-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). An early study demonstrated ECP purification using heparin-Sepharose chromatography (21Gleich G.J. Loegering D.A. Bell M.P. Checkel J.L. Ackerman S.J. McKean D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3146-3150Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, the minimal heparin length (or disaccharide unit) required to interact with ECP was investigated by FACE. Initially, ECP was co-incubated with AMAC-labeled LMWH at various molar ratios, and the binding products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The decrease in the free LMWH signal was monitored as ECP concentration was increased (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, the dependence of ECP binding on heparin size was examined in the presence of synthetic heparin oligosaccharides dp3 to dp9 using LMWH as a positive control. It was apparent that dp5 served as the shortest heparin fragment that retained the ability to bind ECP (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we tested a potent heparanase inhibitor (PI-88), undergoing clinical trials for its anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic effects (22Joyce J.A. Freeman C. Meyer-Morse N. Parish C.R. Hanahan D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4037-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Parish C.R. Freeman C. Brown K.J. Francis D.J. Cowden W.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3433-3441PubMed Google Scholar), that contains a mixture of highly sulfated mannose-containing di- to hexasaccharides (24Yu G. Gunay N.S. Linhardt R.J. Toida T. Fareed J. Hoppensteadt D.A. Shadid H. Ferro V. Li C. Fewings K. Palermo M.C. Podger D. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 37: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Ferro V. Li C. Fewings K. Palermo M.C. Linhardt R.J. Toida T. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this heparin mimetic could also bind ECP (Fig. 2B). Competitive Inhibition of ECP Binding to Cells by Synthetic Oligosaccharides—Using cell ELISA, synthetic heparins (dp3–dp9) were tested for their ability to interfere with ECP binding to Beas-2B cells. Beas-2B cells were preincubated with oligosaccharides, and bound ECP was detected essentially as described (9Fan T.C. Chang H.T. Chen I.W. Wang H.Y. Chang M.D. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1778-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The degree of inhibition increased with increasing oligosaccharide length (Fig. 3). 50 μg/ml heparin dp5 inhibited 50% of ECP binding to cells, and the same amount of dp7 and dp9 was capable of inhibiting over 70 and 80% of ECP binding, respectively. These data revealed that pentasaccharide was the minimal length sufficient to interfere with ECP binding to Beas-2B cells. In addition, the concentration dependence of PI-88 against cellular binding of ECP was similar to that of dp7 (Fig. 3). Identification of Heparin-binding Sequence in ECP—A consensus sequence of the heparin binding site (e.g. XBBXBX or XBBBXXBX) has been found in many glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins or peptides (3Lehrer R. Szklarek D. Barton A. Ganz T. Hamann K. Gleich G. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4428-4434PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inspection of the sequences of human RNase A family members revealed a surface loop L3 region, 34QRRCKN39, in EDN that exactly matched the XBBXBX motif (Fig. 4A), but no consensus heparin-binding motif was found in ECP. Therefore, we speculated that residues 34–39 (34RWRCKN39) in ECP that correspond to the consensus motif in EDN might also bind heparin. To determine whether this region contributes to cellular binding, cell ELISA analysis was conducted using MBP-ECP and MBP-ECP mt1 containing the mutations R34A/W35A/R36A/K38A. This mutant had only 50% of the cell-binding activity, indicating the importance of the 34RWRCKN39 motif in ECP for cellular HS binding (Fig. 4B). Characterization of Association between ECP and Heparin Oligosaccharides—The binding affinities of wild-type and mutant ECP for heparin oligosaccharides were subsequently monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence titration (27Lau E.K. Paavola C.D. Johnson Z. Gaudry J.P. Geretti E. Borlat F. Kungl A.J. Proudfoot A.E. Handel T.M. J. Biol.

The change in tryptophan fluorescence revealed that wild-type ECP bound to dp5 with high affinity, and the corresponding Kd was 139.6 nm (Fig. 5). As expected, a 4- to 5-fold increase in Kd to 568.1 nm was observed for ECP mt1 (R34A/W35A/R36A/K38A) (Table 1), indicating decreased heparin-binding activity for mutant ECP lacking the key heparin-binding motif in the L3 region.TABLE 1Dissociation constant (Kd) determination for wild-type ECP and ECP mt1 with heparin oligosaccharides Kd was measured in PBS at 25 °C.

These results strongly indicated that the decrease in heparin binding affinity resulted from a loss of the specific recognition sequence motif, but not from a conformational change in ECP mt1. Competitive Inhibition of ECP Binding to Cells by Synthetic Peptides—To investigate whether the RWRCK motif was directly responsible for heparin binding, cell ELISA was conducted using a synthetic peptide, C1 (NYRWRCKNQNK), along with a positive control peptide derived from HIV-TAT, YGRKKRRQRRRK (28Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar, 29Ziegler A. Seelig J. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 254-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The dose-dependent competition of these peptides is shown in Fig. 6A. Binding of MBP-ECP to cell-surface HS was significantly reduced in the presence of both C1 and TAT peptides. Therefore, synthetic peptides with heparin-binding activity may compete with ECP for cellular binding. Furthermore, the cell surface-binding ability of peptides, including D1 (NYQRRCKNQNK) derived from EDN and R1 (MTQGRCKPVNK) derived from RNase1 was tested using cell ELISA assay. As expected, similar to the TAT peptide, C1 and D1 peptides bound to the cell surface, whereas R1 peptide was devoid of such function (Fig. 6B). Interaction of Synthetic Peptides with LMWH—The ability of C1 to directly interact with LMWH was further investigated by FACE analysis. As expected, a decreased amount of free AMAC-LMWH signal was observed with increasing concentration of C1 peptide or TAT peptide (Fig. 7). In addition, D1 bound heparin as tightly as C1. Interestingly, although the peptide segment in the corresponding location of human RNase 1 also contains several positively charged residues, it did not bind heparin. Taken together, these results indicate that the RWRCK motif within loop L3 of ECP serves as a specific heparin binding site. Characterization of Association between C1 and Heparin Oligosaccharides—The definitive heparin-binding activity of the C1 peptide was determined by ITFE, which clearly demonstrated that C1 has high affinity for heparin (Fig. 8). The Kd values obtained for LMWH, dp9, and dp5 binding to the C1 peptide were 192.0, 229.1, and 274.8 nm, respectively (Table 2), indicating that C1 bound tighter to longer heparin oligosaccharides.TABLE 2Determination of dissociation constants (Kd) for C1 peptide with heparin oligosaccharidesOligosaccharideKdnmLMWH192.0dp9229.1dp5274.8 Open table in a new tab Growth Inhibitory Effect of ECP—The inhibition of lymphocyte and mammalian cell growth by ECP has been reported (9Fan T.C.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As a physiological test, the cytotoxicity of ECP mt1 was monitored by MTT assay. As compared with wild-type ECP, ECP mt1 (R34A/W35A/R36A/K38A) exhibited a 2- to 3-fold increased IC50 value toward the Beas-2B cell line (Fig. 9 and Table 3). Thus, ECP mt1 without the key heparin binding sequence motif appears to be less cytotoxic than wild-type ECP, presumably due to weaker interaction with the cell surface, which in turn leads to decreased endocytosis.TABLE 3IC50 values for cytotoxic ECPProteinIC50μmECP wtaData taken from Ref. 916.05ECP mt138.52a Data taken from Ref. 9Fan T.C.

Immunohistochemical localization showed strong internalization of ECP in the tracheo- and bronchoepithelial cells 1 h post-injection (Fig. 10, A and B). ECP internalization was reduced when co-injection with heparin was carried out (Fig. 10C). For the negative control, no MBP signal was detected in tracheo- and bronchoepithelial cells (Fig. 10D), despite the MBP signal that could be detected in circulating blood (Fig. 10D). Here we provide the first direct evidence that a linear heparin binding site within ECP contributes to its cellular binding and cytotoxicity. The peptide derived from this domain exhibits a substantial binding affinity to heparin. The specific interaction with heparin mediated by the loop L3 region of ECP was analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis and synthetic peptides to determine the dissociation constant. We have shown that heparin dp5 binds to ECP with a Kd of 139.6 nm. Increased ECP binding affinity with increasing heparin oligosaccharide chain length was observed, indicating that longer heparin chains with an additional structural motif might strengthen polysaccharide-protein interactions. The mutagenesis study revealed that ECP mt1 (R34A/W35A/R36A/K38A), lacking the crucial heparin binding sequence motif, had reduced heparin-binding activity and was thus less cytotoxic than wild-type ECP. ITFE demonstrated that ECP mt1 had reduced heparin-binding activity. To further show direct heparin-binding activity of the loop L3 in ECP, the C1 and D1 peptides spanning residues 32–41 of ECP and EDN, respectively, were synthesized. Cell ELISA analysis revealed that C1 and D1 peptides interfered molecular interaction between ECP and cell surface HSPG. Studies of heparin binding by FACE showed that ECP C1 and EDN D1 bound as tightly to heparin as HIV-TAT peptide. On the other hand, the R1 peptide derived from RNase1, with positive charge density similar to C1, showed much lower affinity toward heparin, indicating that specific heparin-binding activity of C1 resulted not only from the positive charges but also from the amino acid sequence. Furthermore, in ITFE binding assays, C1 had high binding capacity for heparin, indicating that the heparin binding site in ECP is indeed located within the loop L3 region connecting helix α2 and strand β1. It has been shown that N-bromosuccinimide-modified ECP elutes from heparin chromatography at a slightly lower concentration of NaCl than unmodified ECP, indicating the contribution of tryptophan residues (Trp-10 and Trp-35) to heparin binding (32Maeda T. Kitazoe M. Tada H. Llorens R.d. Salomon D.S. Ueda M. Yamada H. Seno M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cellular binding activity of ECP W10A was only slightly decreased (<10%) as compared with that of wild-type ECP, whereas ECP W35A exhibited 50% lower binding, strongly indicating the involvement of Trp-35 in heparin binding. 3T.-c. Fan, S.-l. Fang, C.-s. Hwang, C.-y. Hsu, X.-a. Lu, S.-c. Hung, S.-C. Lin, and M. D.-T. Chang, unpublished data. In this study, Trp-35 together with the positively charged residues in loop L3 of ECP are likely to constitute a novel heparin-binding motif and, thus, are responsible for the heparin-binding activity. The heparin-binding activity of ECP mt1 was reduced 5-fold as compared with that of wild-type ECP, suggesting that residues Arg-34, Trp-35, Arg-36, and Lys-38 contribute to the overall free energy of the heparin-ECP interaction. However, this mutant still retained some heparin-binding ability. Because there are 19 arginine residues on the surface of ECP, some of which may form an extended binding surface together with the loop L3, detailed analysis of the contribution of each positively charged residue remains to be determined. Interestingly, the putative binding site identified in this study shares common features with that of EDN, indicating that the loop L3 of eosinophil RNases may contribute to their shared functions. These results suggest that the heparin binding and uptake mechanism of EDN are likely to be similar to those of ECP. The accumulation of a high concentration of ECP on the cell surface through interaction with HSPGs likely results in membrane perturbation and subsequent cytotoxicity. Immunohistochemical staining showed that ECP had high affinity for tracheo- and bronchoepithelial cells. Although HSPGs are ubiquitously expressed on all kinds of cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix, the HS disaccharide composition seems to be tissue-specific (33Maccarana M. Sakura Y.

The HS disaccharide composition and the overall degree of sulfation of murine tissues have been analyzed. The HS fingerprint has shown that lung tissue contains relatively high overall 2-O-sulfation due to the presence of 2-O-sulfated glucuronic acid-containing disaccharides (34Ledin J. Staatz W. Li J.P. Gotte M. Selleck S. Kjellen L. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42732-42741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Moreover, HS is presented in block structures, consisting of highly sulfated and non-sulfated domains. It is possible that HSs of tracheo- and bronchoepithelial cells have unique characteristics that serve as the principle receptor or co-receptor for ECP. The most prominent example is the requirement of contiguous stretches of the disaccharide 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid N-sulfated glucosamine for efficient interaction with fibroblast growth factor-2, and sulfation at the 6-O position of heparin may be required for cell signaling (15Guimond S.

Biol. 2005; 12: 267-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In summary, we have determined that pentasaccharides are the minimal sugar motif that can bind to ECP. The specific heparin binding site located within the loop L3 of ECP is critical for its physiological function. Our results may assist in determining the physiological role of ECP in vivo and further rational design of heparin mimetics to interfere with the cellular interactions of cytotoxic ECP."

To find out whether this CCB pathway also operates in higher plants and extend the knowledge of the c-type cytochrome biogenesis, we studied Arabidopsis insertion mutants in the orthologs of the CCB genes. The ccb1, ccb2, and ccb4 mutants show a phenotype characterized by a deficiency in the accumulation of the subunits of the cytochrome b6f complex and lack covalent heme binding to cytochrome b6. These mutants were functionally complemented with the corresponding wild type cDNAs. Using fluorescent protein reporters, we demonstrated that the CCB1, CCB2, CCB3, and CCB4 proteins are targeted to the chloroplast compartment of Arabidopsis. We have extended our study to the YGGT family, to which CCB3 belongs, by studying insertion mutants of two additional members of this family for which no mutants were previously characterized, and we showed that they are not functionally involved in the CCB system. Thus, we demonstrate the ubiquity of the CCB proteins in chloroplast heme c(i)' binding."
https://openalex.org/W1972648046,"The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) regulates cell division in eukaryotes by targeting specific proteins for destruction. APC substrates generally contain one or more short degron sequences that help mediate their recognition and poly-ubiquitination by the APC. The most common and well characterized degrons are the destruction box (D box) and the KEN box. The budding yeast Acm1 protein, an inhibitor of Cdh1-activated APC (APCCdh1) also contains several conserved D and KEN boxes, and here we report that two of these located in the central region of Acm1 constitute a pseudosubstrate sequence required for APCCdh1 inhibition. Acm1 interacted with and inhibited substrate binding to the WD40 repeat domain of Cdh1. Combined mutation of the central D and KEN boxes strongly reduced both binding to the Cdh1 WD40 domain and APCCdh1 inhibition. Despite this, the double mutant, but not wild-type Acm1, was poly-ubiquitinated by APCCdh1 in vitro. Thus, unlike substrates in which D and KEN boxes promote ubiquitination, these same elements in the central region of Acm1 prevent ubiquitination. We propose that this unique property of the Acm1 degron sequences results from an unusually high affinity interaction with the substrate receptor site on the WD40 domain of Cdh1 that may serve both to promote APC inhibition and protect Acm1 from destruction.

Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Several of these substrates were recently reported to be overexpressed in a wide range of malignant cancers (9Lehman N.L. Tibshirani R. Hsu J.Y. Natkunam Y. Harris B.T. West R.B.

Substrate recognition was originally proposed to be mediated by the Cdc20 and Cdh1 proteins, two related WD40 repeat domain proteins that are essential for APC activity at different times during the cell cycle (10Schwab M.

Cell. 2004; 13: 137-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the exact mechanism by which Cdc20 and Cdh1 activate APC remains unclear.Because substrate selectivity by APC in vivo is highly specific, one might expect substrates to share common sequence motifs required for their recognition. To a certain extent this is true. The destruction box (D box) was originally identified as a conserved 9-amino acid motif in sea urchin cyclin B (26Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Mutations in the D box (consensus RXXLXXXXN) in cyclin B prevented its ubiquitination and proteolysis. Functional RXXLD boxes are found in the majority of APC substrates, but not all. Additional short amino acid sequences have subsequently been identified that can direct APC-dependent ubiquitination and proteolysis either in the absence of, or in conjunction with, D boxes. The most common and well characterized of these additional degrons is the KEN box, originally identified in human Cdc20 (27Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665PubMed Google Scholar), but now found in many APC substrates. Additional degrons include the A box found in Xenopus Aurora A kinase (28Castro A. Vigneron S. Bernis C. Labbe J.C. Prigent C. Lorca T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V.

Chem. 2007; 282: 19710-19715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The KEN box was thought to be a specific signal for recognition by Cdh1 (27Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665PubMed Google Scholar). This theory has been supported by several studies (33Hendrickson C. Meyn 3rd, M.A. Morabito L. Holloway S.L. Curr.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4500-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but exceptions have also been found (12Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2381-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 36Burton J.L. Solomon M.J.

Moreover, the existence of the other, apparently unrelated, degrons has further clouded the understanding of substrate recognition by APC. Also, many proteins that are clearly not APC substrates contain sequences that match the D box, KEN box, and other APC degrons. Thus, sequence context surrounding the degrons, and possibly other factors, are clearly important contributors to substrate recognition as well.A recently identified mechanism for regulation of APC activity is pseudosubstrate inhibition. Pseudosubstrate inhibition is best characterized in kinases where intramolecular amino acid motifs mimicking a natural substrate sit in the kinase active site to suppress activity in the absence of an activating signal (38Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. House C. Robinson P.J. Means A.R. Cell. Signal. 1989; 1: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The vertebrate Emi1 protein was recently proposed to be a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of the APC (39Miller J.J. Summers M.K. Hansen D.V. Nachury M.V. Lehman N.L. Loktev A. Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2410-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Emi1 competitively inhibits substrate binding to the APC and co-activators (39Miller J.J. Summers M.K. Hansen D.V. Nachury M.V. Lehman N.L. Loktev A. Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2410-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 40Reimann J.D. Gardner B.E. Margottin-Goguet F. Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3278-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This activity is dependent on a D box in Emi1 suggesting that Emi1 interacts with APC similar to a true substrate. But why is it not ubiquitinated like a substrate and targeted for proteolysis? Miller et al. (39Miller J.J. Summers M.K. Hansen D.V. Nachury M.V. Lehman N.L. Loktev A. Jackson P.K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2410-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) found that the zinc binding domain of Emi1 was essential for APC inhibition and removal of this region allowed Emi1 to be ubiquitinated and destroyed in a D box-dependent manner. Thus, the Emi1 D box promotes high affinity binding to the substrate recognition site on the coactivator-APC complex while the zinc binding region blocks the catalytic activity of APC. The yeast Mad3 protein, an essential component of the spindle checkpoint that inhibits APCCdc20 activity, was also proposed to act by a pseudosubstrate mechanism (36Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the observation that mutations in two conserved KEN boxes and a D box in Mad3 compromise its interaction with Cdc20, its ability to block substrate binding to Cdc20, and its ability to function in the spindle checkpoint. Another recent report obtained similar results but also provided evidence that Mad3 is a substrate of APCCdh1 (37King E.M. van der Sar S.J. Hardwick K.G. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e342Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), raising the intriguing possibility that it inhibits one form of APC (APCCdc20) and is a substrate of the other (APCCdh1). Pseudosubstrate inhibitors will likely be useful models for further defining the determinants of APC substrate recognition.Recently, the budding yeast Acm1 protein was identified as a stable binding partner of Cdh1 and an inhibitor of APCCdh1 activity (41Dial J.M. Petrotchenko E.V. Borchers C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5237-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 42Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Acm1 contains conserved D box and KEN box sequences, suggesting that it also could be a pseudosubstrate inhibitor similar to Emi1 and Mad3. We have addressed that hypothesis here by studying the effects of D and KEN box mutations in Acm1. We conclude that Acm1 is indeed a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of APCCdh1. Interestingly, we observed a unique property of a D and KEN box pair in the central region of Acm1 required for high affinity Cdh1 binding and APCCdh1 inhibition. Contrary to their typical functions in APC substrates, these sequences prevent APCCdh1-catalyzed ubiquitination of Acm1. This could be important to promote the inhibitory function of Acm1 by protecting it from destruction. We discuss the implications for our understanding of substrate recognition and mechanisms of APC activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Plasmids, and Yeast Methods—Standard media and growth conditions were used for all yeast experiments.All yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strain YKA294 was constructed by PCR-mediated replacement of the ACM1 coding sequence in YKA291 (42Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with the KanMX4 cassette using standard procedures. Plasmids pHLP127 and pHLP128 expressing 3FLAG-tagged Cdh1 truncations 1–249 and 241–566, respectively, were constructed by amplifying the desired sequence by PCR and replacing the intact CDH1 sequence from pHLP130 (42Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using NotI and XhoI restriction sites. pHLP273 was constructed by subcloning the XbaI-XhoI fragment from pHLP128 into p413ADH. Mutation of Acm1 degron residues (Arg and Leu of the D boxes and Lys, Glu, and Asn of the KEN box) to alanine were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and either pHLP117 or pHLP109 (42Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as template. All mutations and all plasmids constructed using PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Open table in a new tab Plasmids for in vitro transcription and translation to generate substrates for the ubiquitination assay were constructed by amplifying genes by PCR from yeast genomic DNA or available plasmid constructs and inserting the products into the NcoI and XhoI sites in pET28a. For HSL1 and FIN1, we used previously described gene fragments encoding the truncated amino acid sequences 667–872 and 1–152, respectively, which are sufficient for recognition by APCCdh1 (12Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2381-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 44Woodbury E.L. Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). ACM1 truncations were based on secondary structure predictions. Clb2 was synthesized from pRSET-CLB2 (18Passmore L.A. McCormack E.A. Au S.W. Paul A. Willison K.R. Harper J.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Protein Purification—To isolate APC, Cdc27–3FLAG was immunoaffinity-purified from YKA155 essentially as described (45Hall M.C. Torres M.P. Schroeder G.K. Borchers C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16698-16705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and stored in small aliquots at –80 °C immediately after elution from anti-FLAG antibody resin. 3FLAG-Cdh1 was purified as described (46Hall M.C. Warren E.N. Borchers C.H. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) except phosphatase inhibitors were omitted and, following elution from anti-FLAG resin, was dialyzed into storage buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol) for 6 h. Aliquots were stored at –80 °C, and a working aliquot was kept at –20 °C, which maintained activity for at least a couple months. Ubc4-His6 and wild-type and mutant His6-Acm1 proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography using 1-ml HisTrap columns and anÁKTA fast-protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare), dialyzed into storage buffer overnight, and stored in aliquots at –80 °C. Working aliquots were kept at –20 °C. All protein concentrations were estimated by densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels using a bovine serum albumin standard curve.Ubiquitination Assay—l-[35S]Methionine (GE Healthcare or MP Biomedicals) was used to label APC substrates in TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation reactions (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the product instructions. Ubiquitination reactions were based largely on assays from the Morgan and Barford groups (47Carroll C.W. Morgan D.O. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 48Passmore L.A. Barford D. Wade Harper J. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 195-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and contained 200 nm yeast Uba1 (Boston Biochem), 10 μm Ubc4-His6, ∼100 nm 3FLAG-Cdh1, ∼2 nm APC, 1 mg/ml recombinant human ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), 20 μg/ml ubiquitin aldehyde (Boston Biochem), 25 μm MG-132 (Peptides International), and 3–4 μl of the appropriate TnT-generated 35S-labeled substrate all in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The Uba1, Ubc4-His6, and ubiquitin were preincubated together in the presence of Mg2+-ATP first for 10 min at 23 °C to generate ubiquitin-charged E2 prior to addition of the remaining components. Reactions (20 μl of total volume) were incubated at 23 °C for 30 min and stopped by boiling in SDS loading buffer. Products were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were subjected to PhosphorImager analysis using a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon 8600 imaging system and ImageQuant software.Co-immunoprecipitation—Co-IP assays were performed exactly as described (42Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 49Hall M.C. Jeong D.E. Henderson J.T. Choi E. Bremmer S.C. Iliuk A.B.

For immunoblotting, anti-HA 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science) was used at 1:1,000 and anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) at 1:10,000 dilutions. Immunoblots were developed with ECL plus reagents (GE Healthcare).Protein Stability and Cell Cycle Profiles—Protein stability was measured by galactose promoter shutoff assays exactly as described (49Hall M.C.

Cell cycle expression profiles were determined by α-factor block and release and immunoblotting as described (42Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In Vivo APC Inhibition Assay—Inhibition of APCCdh1 was measured in vivo as described previously (42Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).RESULTSAcm1 Is a General Inhibitor of APCCdh1 Activity Independent of 14-3-3 Binding and Phosphorylation—Acm1 purified from yeast was previously shown to inhibit the ubiquitination of Clb2 by APCCdh1 in vitro (41Dial J.M. Petrotchenko E.V. Borchers C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5237-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We first wanted to know if Acm1 is a general inhibitor of APCCdh1 or is specific for Clb2, and also to determine if CDK phosphorylation and 14-3-3 protein binding, two known regulatory mechanisms controlling Acm1 stability (41Dial J.M. Petrotchenko E.V. Borchers C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5237-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 42Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 10396-10407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were important for inhibitory function. This information was critical to establishing an appropriate in vitro assay to study the mechanism of APCCdh1 inhibition by Acm1. To do this, we tested the ability of recombinant His6-Acm1 purified from E. coli to inhibit APCCdh1-catalyzed ubiquitination of the well characterized substrates Hsl1667–872 (12Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2381-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), Fin11–152 (44Woodbury E.L. Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and Pds1 (3Cohen-Fix O. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Koshland D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), in addition to Clb2 (Fig. 1, A and B). Acm1 effectively inhibited ubiquitination of all four substrates and showed a similar concentration dependence for each. We conclude that Acm1 is a general inhibitor of APCCdh1 activity.The results in Fig. 1 using recombinant His6-Acm1 also strongly suggest that CDK phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding are not required for APC inhibition. To confirm this, we tested the ability of an Acm1 mutant lacking CDK phosphorylation sites, Acm1–5A (49Hall M.C. Jeong D.E. Henderson J.T. Choi E. Bremmer S.C. Iliuk A.B. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10396-10407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), to inhibit APCCdh1 in vivo. Overexpression of Cdh1 is lethal due to constitutive APC activity that prevents proper cyclin accumulation and mitotic entry (10Schwab M. Lutum A.S. Seufert W. Cell. 1997; 90: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 11Visintin R. Prinz S. Amon A. Science. 1997; 278: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). We previously showed that co-overexpression of Acm1 suppresses this lethality (42Martinez J.S. Jeong D.E. Choi E. Billings B.M. Hall M.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 9162-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), establishing an assay to monitor APCCdh1 inhibition in vivo. The Acm1–5A mutant cannot be phosphorylated by CDK and is defective in 14-3-3 protein binding (49Hall M.C. Jeong D.E. Henderson J.T. Choi E. Bremmer S.C. Iliuk A.B. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10396-10407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), yet when overexpressed in cells containing a lethal Cdh1 level, it fully restores viability like wild-type Acm1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, Acm1 does not require phosphorylation or binding to the 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1 and Bmh2 to act as an inhibitor of APCCdh1.Conserved D Box and KEN Box Sequences in Acm1 Are Required for High Affinity Binding to the Substrate Receptor Site on the Cdh1 WD40 Domain—Alignment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Acm1 with orthologs from other Saccharomyces species and other budding yeasts of the order Saccharomycetales revealed conserved sequence motifs common to APC substrates (Fig. 2). These include a D box near the N terminus (D box 1) and a D box (D box 3) and KEN box in the central region. An additional D box in the central region (D box 2) is not conserved. We speculated that the conserved degron-like sequences might be important for APC inhibition and that Acm1 might act as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor like Emi1 and Mad3 (36Burton J.L. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 39Miller J.J. Summers M.K. Hansen D.V. Nachury M.V. Lehman N.L. Loktev A. Jackson P.K.

First, we examined the ability of mutant proteins expressed with an N-terminal 3HA tag from the ACM1 promoter to bind endogenous 3FLAG-Cdh1.

https://openalex.org/W1964116972,"Neuronal leucine-rich repeat protein-1 (NLRR1) gene encodes a type I transmembrane protein with unknown function. We have previously described that NLRR1 gene is highly expressed in unfavorable neuroblastomas as compared with favorable tumors and its higher expression levels correlate significantly with poor clinical outcome. In this study, we have found that NLRR1 gene is one of direct target genes for N-MYC and its gene product contributes to N-MYC-dependent growth promotion in neuroblastoma. Expression levels of NLRR1 were significantly associated with those of N-MYC in various neuroblastoma cell lines as well as primary neuroblastoma tissues. Indeed, enforced expression of N-MYC resulted in a remarkable induction of the endogenous NLRR1. Consistent with these results, we have identified two functional E-boxes within the promoter region and intron 1 of NLRR1 gene. Intriguingly, c-myc also transactivated NLRR1 gene. Enforced expression of NLRR1 promoted cell proliferation and rendered cells resistant to serum deprivation. In support with these observations, small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous NLRR1-reduced growth rate and sensitized cells to serum starvation. Collectively, our present findings provide a novel insight into understanding molecular mechanisms behind aggressive neuroblastoma with N-MYC amplification."
https://openalex.org/W1993378987,"The aim of the study was to test whether the source of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) is a determinant of beta cell function. We hypothesized that elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ caused by the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) have little physiologic impact on oxygen consumption and insulin secretion. Ca2+ release from the ER was induced in isolated rat islets by acetylcholine and response of oxygen consumption rate (OCR), NAD(P)H, cytosolic Ca2+, and insulin secretory rate (ISR) were measured. Glucose increased all four parameters, and thereafter acetylcholine further increased cytosolic Ca2+, OCR, and ISR. To assess the contribution of Ca2+ release from the ER in mediating the effects of acetylcholine, ER Ca2+ stores were first emptied by inhibiting the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, which subsequently reduced the effect of acetylcholine on cytosolic Ca2+ but not its effects on OCR or ISR. As predicted, OCR and ISR were acutely sensitive to changes in L-type Ca2+ channel activity; nimodipine completely inhibited glucose-stimulated ISR and suppressed OCR by 36%, despite only inhibiting cytosolic Ca2+ by 46%. Moreover, in the presence of nimodipine and high glucose, acetylcholine still elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels above those observed in the presence of high glucose alone but did not significantly stimulate ISR. In conclusion, Ca2+ flux through L-type Ca2+ channels was tightly coupled to changes in OCR and ISR. In contrast, the results obtained support the notion that Ca2+ release from the ER has little or no access to the intracellular machinery that regulates OCR and ISR.

An established model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion reflects an essential role for the consequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration as a trigger for insulin granule exocytosis (1Henquin J.C. Ravier M.A. Nenquin M. Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 33: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, Ca2+ can enter the cytosol from multiple sources including transport across the membrane, largely from voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels, as well as from intracellular stores (2Satin L.S.

To address the relative contribution of Ca2+ from different sources on insulin secretion, two factors have to be considered. The first is the relative amount of Ca2+ released into the cytosol from each source, and the second is the functional impact of the Ca2+ from different sources on insulin secretion.

It is further generally believed that the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ resulting from release from the ER can stimulate insulin secretion and in particular mediates the powerful effects of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that strongly stimulates the release of Ca2+ from the ER, on insulin secretion rate (ISR) (9Hamakawa N.

In support of this hypothesis, we have recently found that blocking or increasing Ca2+ flux through L-type Ca2+ channels has a dramatic effect on oxygen consumption rate (OCR) by islets, whereas in contrast, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ of similar magnitude induced by blocking the SERCA had no effect (8Sweet I.R. Gilbert M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because the metabolic rate as reflected by OCR is an integral part of the mechanism mediating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, this suggests that the effect of Ca2+ from the ER has little functional effect on exocytotic machinery.The observed differential effects of cytosolic Ca2+ derived from L-type Ca2+ channels and ER support the microdomain concept where there are at least two pools of cytosolic Ca2+: one that is exclusively supplied by L-type Ca2+ channels and one that has little access to the targets associated with increase secretion. If true, this would have broad implications on accepted mechanisms mediating insulin secretion, where release of Ca2+ from intracellular sources is thought to play an important role (3Wollheim C.B.

In addition, it would bring into question the interpretability of bulk cytosolic Ca2+ data as determined by imaging because a significant portion of the signal would not be functionally relevant. Accordingly, we compared the effects of acetylcholine to stimulate the release of Ca2+ from the ER, and nimodipine, a blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels, to assess the relative contributions of Ca2+ from these sources on OCR and ISR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Krebs-Rer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) was used for all perifusion analyses, prepared as debed previously (8Sweet I.R. Gilbert M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Potassium cyanide, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), nimodipine, acetylcholine, diazoxide, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA), thapsigargin, and ouabain were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Fura-2 AM and pluronic acid were purchased from Invitrogen, and platinum tetrapentafluorophenyl porphyrin was purchased from Porphyrin Products (Logan, UT).Rat Islet Isolation and Culture—The islets were harvested from male, diabetes-resistant BB rats (≈250 g, bred in the laboratory of Dr. Åke Lernmark) (21MacMurray A.J. Moralejo D.H. Kwitek A.E. Rutledge E.A. Van Yserloo B. Gohlke P. Speros S.J. Snyder B. Schaefer J. Bieg S. Jiang J. Ettinger R.A. Fuller J. Daniels T.L. Pettersson A. Orlebeke K. Birren B. Jacob H.J.

These rats have normal lymphocyte numbers, do not develop diabetes, and have retained islet characteristics of their progenitor Wistar rats. All of the procedures were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The islets were prepared and purified as described (22Sweet I.R. Cook D.L. DeJulio E. Wallen A.R. Khalil G. Callis J. Reems J. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Matsumoto S. Shibata S. Kirchhof N. Transplantation. 1999; 67: S220Crossref Google Scholar) and then cultured for 18 h at 37 °C prior to the experiments in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).Measurement of OCR and ISR—A flow culture system was used that concomitantly measures OCR while collecting outflow fractions for subsequent measurement of ISR (described previously (22Sweet I.R. Cook D.L. DeJulio E. Wallen A.R. Khalil G. Callis J. Reems J. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Sweet I.R. Cook D.L. Wiseman R.W. Greenbaum C.J. Lernmark A.

Kahn S.E. Callis J.B. Diabetes Technol. Ther. 2002; 4: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). OCR was calculated as the flow rate (∼80 μl/min) times the difference between in-flow and outflow oxygen tension, over the number of islets in the chamber (typically 600) (8Sweet I.R. Gilbert M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Oxygen tension was measured by detecting the phosphorescence lifetime (Tau Theta, Inc.) of an oxygen-sensitive dye (platinum tetrapentafluorophenyl porphyrin) that was painted on the inside of the perifusion chamber (8Sweet I.R. Gilbert M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Insulin was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay per the manufacturer instructions (Mercodia, Sweden), and the ISR was calculated analogously to OCR.Static Measurement of ISR—ISR was determined statically with multiple conditions as previously described (26Niswender C.M. Willis B.S. Wallen A. Sweet I.R. Jetton T.L. Thompson B.R. Wu C. Lange A.J. McKnight G.S. Genesis. 2005; 43: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the islets were handpicked into a Petri dish containing KRB, prepared with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 3 mm glucose, and incubated for 60 min. Subsequently, the islets were picked into the wells of 96-well plates (10/well) containing 200 μl of KRB with desired amounts of glucose and agents as indicated and incubated for 60 more min. At the end of this period, supernatant was assayed for insulin. ISR was calculated as the amount of insulin divided by the incubation time and by the number of islets.Imaging and Quantification of Cytosolic Ca2+—Cytosolic Ca2+ was measured as reflected by fluorescence detection of Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen) after the islets were incubated in 2 μm Fura-2 AM and 0.02% pluronic acid for 40 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the islets were pipetted into a temperature-controlled, 250-μl perifusion dish (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) that was mounted on to the stage of a Nikon Eclipse TE-200 inverted microscope, and KRB (containing 5 mm NaHCO3) was pumped through the dish at a flow rate of 150 μl/min. Fluorescent emission was detected at 510 nm by a Photometrics Cool Snap EZ camera (Tucson, AZ) during alternating excitation at either 340 or 380 nm. The results are displayed as the ratio of the fluorescent intensities during excitation at these two wavelengths (F340/F380).Imaging and Quantification of NAD(P)H—NAD(P)H autofluorescence was measured similarly to Ca2+, except there was no need for loading with dye, and the excitation and emission wavelengths were 360 and 460 nm, respectively. To calibrate the relative fluorescence units (RFU), at the end of the experiments the steady state RFU in the presence of potassium cyanide (KCN) and subsequently FCCP was measured. The normalized fluorescence of NAD(P)H was then calculated as follows,&percnt;ReducedNAD(P)H=100×RFUtest-RFUFCCPRFUKCN-RFUFCCP(Eq. 1) where RFUFCCP and RFUKCN equaled the averages of the final 10 time points each agent was present.Selection of Pharmacologic Agent Concentrations—In this study, a number of well characterized effector agents were used, and the concentration at which they were used reflected a balance between achieving their maximal effect while minimizing the extent of side effects. For acetylcholine, 10 μm was chosen because this concentration leads to a maximal steady state cytosolic Ca2+ level (27Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); 5 μm thapsigargin was used because 1 μm blocks ∼90% of the stimulatory effect of acetylcholine on Ca2+ (27Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); 5 μm nimodipine was previously determined to maximally reduce glucose-stimulated OCR and completely inhibit insulin secretion, similar to that of an activator of KATP channels, diazoxide (50 μm) (8Sweet I.R. Gilbert M. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); and TPA (100 nm) and calphostin C (1μm) were chosen to be ∼5 times the IC50 so as to inhibit ∼90% of the process, where IC50 values are 20 nm (28Yanagita T. Kobayashi H. Yamamoto R. Takami Y. Yokoo H. Yuhi T. Nakayama T. Wada A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and 150 nm (29Acevedo-Duncan M. Zhang R. Cooper D.R. Greenberg H.M. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), respectively. Ouabain acts on multiple Na+-K+ pumps with varying IC50 values (1.3 mm, 4.5 μm, and 2.9 nm) (30Jamme I. Petit E. Gerbi A. Maixent J.M. MacKenzie E.T. Nouvelot A. Brain Res. 1997; 774: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), where the latter two high affinity pumps in the brain represent over 75% of the total Na+-K+ activity. Therefore, to inhibit close to 90%, 1 mm was used.Data Analysis—Statistical significance was determined using either Student's t tests or analysis of variance with a Bonferroni post hoc test (as indicated). Both analyses were carried out using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA).RESULTSAcetylcholine Increased OCR, Cytosolic Ca2+, and ISR in Isolated Pancreatic Rat Islets—To test the effect of Ca2+ derived from the ER on OCR and ISR, we used acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that leads to increased inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate levels and stimulation of Ca2+ release from the ER (7Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 565-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Because in a previous study changes in cytosolic Ca2+ mediated by inhibition of SERCA left OCR unchanged, our expectation was that acetylcholine would have no effect on OCR. Accordingly, we measured OCR, cytosolic Ca2+, NAD(P)H, and ISR in response to acetylcholine to systematically characterize its effects on islet function. Measurements were made first in response to an increase in glucose from 3 to 20 mm, followed by stimulation with 10 μm acetylcholine (Fig. 1). Consistent with previous studies, cytosolic Ca2+ and ISR increased in response to glucose and were further increased by acetylcholine. Unexpectedly, OCR increased in response to 10 μm acetylcholine by ∼30% of glucose-induced increase in OCR. Therefore, from these results, it was not possible to evaluate whether the effect of acetylcholine on OCR was due to the release of ER Ca2+ or other changes elicited by acetylcholine. NAD(P)H was measured to test whether stimulation of OCR by acetylcholine was mediated by an increase in the rate of glycolysis and/or the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, this parameter was unaffected by acetylcholine (Fig. 1).Lack of Effect of Ca2+ Release from the ER on Acetylcholine Stimulation of OCR and ISR—To determine whether ER Ca2+ release was mediating the acetylcholine-induced stimulation of OCR and ISR, ER stores of Ca2+ were depleted prior to acetylcholine stimulation. Thapsigargin (5 μm), a blocker of SERCA, elevated cytosolic Ca2+ for at least 45 min, during which OCR was not significantly affected; ISR increased but only after a 30-min delay relative to the elevation of Ca2+ (Fig. 2). Subsequently, in the presence of thapsigargin, acetylcholine had a much reduced effect on Ca2+; the first phase peak was barely observable, and the increase in the second phase response was only very gradual. Overall, the thapsigargin decreased the total Ca2+ response to acetylcholine (averaged over the 45-min period during exposure to acetylcholine) by 58%: 0.019 ± 0.003 (Fig. 2) versus 0.046 ± 0.007 (Fig. 1) in the presence and absence of thapsigargin, respectively (p = 0.014 using a Student's t test). However, the stimulatory effects of on both ISR and OCR were retained. These results demonstrate that the responses of OCR and ISR to acetylcholine are primarily dissociated from ER Ca2+ release.FIGURE 2Effect of blocking SERCA activity on stimulation of Ca2+, OCR, and ISR by acetylcholine. Islets were perifused in the presence of 3 mm glucose (glc) for 90 min; at time 0, glucose concentration was raised to 20 mm for 45 min; subsequently, SERCA activity was inhibited by thapsigargin (thap, 5 μm) for 45 min prior to stimulation with acetylcholine (Ach, 10 μm). Top panel, detection of a Ca2+ by fluorescence imaging. Middle and bottom panels, OCR and ISR were measured concomitantly using the flow culture system. The data are displayed and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Steady state values of OCR and ISR at 3 mm glucose were 0.25 ± 0.031 nmol/min/100 islets and 0.68 ± 0.19 ng/min/100 islets, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dependence of Acetylcholine Response on L-type Ca2+ Channel Activation—To determine whether an increase in Ca2+ uptake through the plasma membrane contributed to the effects of acetylcholine, cytosolic Ca2+, OCR, and ISR were measured in the presence of nimodipine (5 μm), a specific blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels (Fig. 3). Nimodipine decreased glucose-stimulated cytosolic Ca2+ and OCR by 46.1 ± 8.0 and 36 ± 8.3%, respectively. The presence of nimodipine did not have a significant effect on acetylcholine-induced increases in either of these parameters but potently inhibited the effects of both glucose and acetylcholine on ISR. Similar results were obtained using 50 μm diazoxide to prevent the opening of L-type Ca2+ channels by activating KATP channels (data not shown). Therefore, the effect of acetylcholine on OCR is not mediated by the same mechanism mediating the stimulation of OCR by Ca2+ flux through the L-type Ca2+ channels. Note that at 20 mm glucose, cytosolic Ca2+ in the presence of nimodipine and acetylcholine was higher than in the absence of these two agents, but the change in ISR in response to acetylcholine was similar to that seen in the presence of 3 mm glucose, demonstrating the pre-eminence of L-type Ca2+ channels in the regulation of insulin secretion.FIGURE 3Effect of blocking L-type Ca2+ channels on stimulation of Ca2+, OCR, and ISR by acetylcholine. Islets were perifused in the presence of 3 mm glucose (glc) for 90 min; at time 0, glucose concentration was raised to 20 mm for 45 min; subsequently, L-type Ca2+ channels were inhibited by nimodipine (5 μm) for 45 min prior to stimulation with acetylcholine (Ach, 10 μm). Top panel, detection of intracellular Ca2+ by fluorescence imaging. Middle and bottom panels, OCR and ISR were measured concomitantly using the flow culture system. The data are displayed and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Steady state values of OCR and ISR at 3 mm glucose were 0.39 ± 0.054 nmol/min/100 islets and 0.41 ± 0.11 ng/min/100 islets, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Lack of Effect of PKC Inhibitors on Stimulation of ISR by Acetylcholine—Having shown that acetylcholine can stimulate ISR in the absence of a change in cytosolic Ca2+, we next endeavored to determine whether the effect of acetylcholine on OCR was due to activation of PKC. Calphostin C (1 μm), a blocker of conventional and novel isoforms of PKC, significantly inhibited the potentiation of ISR by 100 nm TPA (a specific activator of PKC), but no effect on the potentiation of ISR by acetylcholine was observed (Fig. 4). Similarly, a lack of effect was observed using another PKC inhibitor, 250 nm bisindolylmaleimide I (data not shown). Thus, it was not possible to demonstrate that PKC was mediating the effect of acetylcholine on ISR.FIGURE 4Effect of inhibition of PKC activity on TPA- and acetylcholine-stimulated ISR. ISR was measured after static incubation (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) in the presence or absence of the PKC blocker calphostin C. The data (n = 6) were normalized to TPA-stimulated ISR (1.4 ± 0.24 ng/min/100 islets) in Fig. 4A and acetylcholine-stimulated ISR in Fig. 4B (2.8 ± 0.34 ng/min/100 islets). The values are shown above each bar because at 3 mm glucose (glc) the value cannot be seen on the graph. Analysis of variance with a Bonferroni post hoc test was used to calculate the statistical significance of all conditions. A, all conditions were significantly different from each other at p > 0.0005. B, all conditions were significantly different from each other (p > 0.0001) except for the comparison between acetylcholine-stimulated ISR in the presence and absence of calphostin C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Lack of Effect of PKC Activation on OCR Despite Stimulation of ISR—Because inhibition of PKC did not give a clear answer on the involvement of PKC in mediating the effects of acetylcholine, the effect of 100 nm TPA was investigated further. Exposure of islets in the flow culture system to TPA increased glucose-stimulated ISR but not OCR (Fig. 5). Thus, amplification of ISR by PKC activation can occur in the absence of changes in OCR.FIGURE 5Effect of activation of PKC on cytosolic Ca2+, OCR, and ISR. Islets were assessed for Ca2+ (top panel) and, in separate experiments, OCR and ISR. The islets were perifused in the presence of 3 mm glucose (glc) for 90 min; at time 0, glucose concentration was raised to 20 mm for 45 min; subsequently, 100 nm TPA was added and removed at 45-min intervals. The data are displayed and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Steady state values of OCR and ISR at 3 mm glucose were 0.41 ± 0.035 nmol/min/100 islets and 0.55 ± 0.39 ng/min/100 islets, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dependence on Na+-K+ Pump Activity of the Effect of Acetylcholine on OCR—Because the effects of 10 μm acetylcholine on OCR cannot be explained by either release of Ca2+ from the ER or by activation of PKC, we investigated whether the effect involved changes in Na+ transport (31Henquin J.C. Garcia M.C. Bozem M. Hermans M.P. Nenquin M. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2134-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Rolland J.F. Henquin J.C. Gilon P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38373-38380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Ouabain (1 mm), a blocker of the Na+-K+ pump, was used to test the involvement of Na+ turnover on acetylcholine stimulation of OCR. Ouabain potentiated glucose-stimulated ISR and cytosolic Ca2+ but had only a small transient effect on OCR (Fig. 6A). The stability of the OCR following the transient change in response to ouabain validated the subsequent protocol for testing the effect of acetylcholine. This was not the case for ISR, which was greatly increased in response to ouabain, making it difficult to interpret changes in this parameter in response to an additional compound. To evaluate the effect of acetylcholine on OCR in the presence of ouabain, acetylcholine was administered 15 min after ouabain (Fig. 6B). The early stimulation of OCR by acetylcholine was still apparent, but the later effect was not (Fig. 6B), and the integrated response of OCR (averaged from 5 to 30 min following exposure to acetylcholine) was reduced by 82% by ouabain (Fig. 7). Of the three inhibitors of ion flux tested, ouabain was the only agent that significantly decreased acetylcholine stimulation of OCR. In summary, acetylcholine stimulation of OCR is dependent on the operation of Na+-K+ pump activity but not on the release of Ca2+ from the ER.FIGURE 6Effect of blocking Na+-K+ pump activity on stimulation of Ca2+, OCR, and ISR by acetylcholine. A, islets were perifused in the presence of 3 mm glucose (glc) for 90 min; at time 0, glucose concentration was raised to 20 mm for 45 min; subsequently, Na+-K+ pump activity was inhibited with 1 mm ouabain for 15 min prior to stimulation with acetylcholine (Ach, 10 μm).

B, same as A except stimulation by acetylcholine was excluded from the protocol.

P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) is a useful model system because introduction of an arginine at position 65 of the first transmembrane (TM) segment could repair folding defects. To determine the mechanism of arginine rescue, we first tested the effects of introducing arginines at other positions in TM1 (residues 52-72) of a P-glycoprotein processing mutant (G251V) that is defective in folding and trafficking to the cell surface (20% maturation efficiency). We found that arginines introduced into one face of the TM1 helix (positions 52, 55, 56, 59, 60, 62, 63, 66, and 67) inhibited maturation, whereas arginines on the opposite face of the helix promoted (positions 64, 65, 68, and 71) or had little effect (positions 61, and 69) on maturation. Arginines at positions 61, 64, 65, and 68 appeared to lie close to the drug binding sites as they reduced the apparent affinity for drug substrates such as vinblastine and verapamil. Therefore, arginines that promoted maturation may face an aqueous drug translocation pathway, whereas those that inhibited maturation may face the lipid bilayer. The highest maturation efficiencies (60-85%) were observed with the Arg-65 and Arg-68 mutants. Mutations that removed hydrogen bond acceptors (Y950F/Y950A or Y953F/Y953A) in TM11 predicted to lie close to Arg-65 or Arg-68 inhibited maturation but did not affect maturation of the G251V parent.

Therefore, arginine may rescue defective folding by promoting packing of the TM segments through hydrogen bond interactions. Mutations that cause an amino acid change in the corresponding protein are responsible for about half the genetic changes known to cause disease (1Ng P.C. Henikoff S. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2006; 7: 61-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). A common defect is that mutant proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum are defective in folding and trafficking (processing mutants), leading to reduced levels or absence of functional protein at a required location (2Sanders C.R. Myers J.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).A classic example of a disease caused by a processing mutation is cystic fibrosis. About 90% of cystic fibrosis patients express a mutant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 2The abbreviations used are:CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorABCATP binding cassetteP-gpP-glycoproteinNBDnucleotide binding domainHEKhuman embryonic kidneyTMtransmembraneTMDTM domain. 2The abbreviations used are:CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorABCATP binding cassetteP-gpP-glycoproteinNBDnucleotide binding domainHEKhuman embryonic kidneyTMtransmembraneTMDTM domain. chloride channel that is missing amino acid Phe-508 (ΔF508 CFTR). The lack of functional CFTR at the surface of epithelial cells lining the airways leads to lung failure due to chronic inflammation (3Rowe S.M. Miller S. Sorscher E.J. N. Engl. J.

Like CFTR, P-gp is an ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter whose maturation is inhibited (retained in the endoplasmic reticulum) by deletion of the amino acid equivalent to Phe-508 (Tyr-590) (4Hoof T.

Chem. 2007; 282: 32043-32052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).The mechanism of arginine rescue is unknown. The arginine side chain is positively charged and has the potential to form the largest number (three) of hydrogen bonds. The presence of a highly charged arginine side chain (pKa about 12.5) would normally be predicted to destabilize a TM segment because of the large free energy barrier of about 17 kcal/mol for exposing it to lipid hydrocarbon (10Dorairaj S. Allen T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4943-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To understand how introduction of an arginine into a TM segment of a P-gp processing mutant could promote maturation, we focused on TM1, as arginine rescue with a L65R substitution was previously found to be particularly efficient (9Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32043-32052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One goal was to test whether it was possible to rescue P-gp processing mutants by introducing arginines at other positions in TM1.Another reason to examine the effects of arginines at other positions in TM1 is that there is evidence that the TM segments of P-gp surround an aqueous drug binding chamber open to the extracellular environment (11Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 12Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12081-12089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For example, electron cryo-microscopy of purified hamster P-gp revealed a potential aqueous pore between the TMDs because it accumulated hydro-philic stain (11Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The ability to label a cysteine (I306C(TM5)) deep within the predicted drug binding pocket of P-gp with charged thiol-reactive compounds such as (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate or [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate also suggested the presence of an aqueous pore (12Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12081-12089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The presence of an aqueous chamber is controversial, however, as fluorescence spectroscopy studies on hamster P-gp suggested that the drug binding sites were located in a very hydrophobic environment with a polarity lower than chloroform. If TM1 lined a hydrophobic channel then we would expect that most introduced arginines would inhibit maturation. If TM1 lines an aqueous channel then we would expect that arginines introduced onto the aqueous face would not inhibit maturation.Accordingly, we first performed arginine-scanning mutagenesis on TM1 of a P-gp processing mutant (G251V) to test their effects on maturation of the mutant. We found evidence that the extracellular end of TM1 appears to line an aqueous channel, as most arginines introduced on one face did not inhibit maturation. It was also found that arginines introduced into a cluster of positions on one face of the extracellular end of TM1 could promote maturation. The most efficient rescue was observed with the M68R mutant. We present evidence which suggests that Arg-68 promotes maturation through hydrogen bond interactions with tyrosines in the extracellular half of TM11.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Mutants—Two tagged versions of human P-gp were used in this study. A P-gp cDNA containing the epitope for monoclonal antibody A52 at the COOH-terminal end was used to distinguish the expressed protein from any endogenous P-gp (13Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second P-gp cDNA was modified to contain a 10-histidine tag at the COOH-terminal end to facilitate purification of the expressed protein by nickel-chelate chromatography (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into wild-type or processing mutant G251V (13Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) P-gp cDNAs as described previously (6Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

To perform arginine-scanning mutagenesis of TM1, the cDNA of mutant G251V P-gp was modified to create a set of mutants that contained one arginine at positions 52-72. For disulfide cross-linking analysis, the cDNA of mutant L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7) (16Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was modified to also encode the G64R, M68R, or V71R mutations. The integrity of all the mutant cDNAs was confirmed by sequencing the entire cDNA (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52349) Google Scholar).Expression and Detection of Mutants—The mutant P-gps were transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) calf serum as described previously (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). For drug-rescue assays, the mutants were expressed in the presence of no drug, 5 μm cyclosporin A, 30 μm verapamil, 5 μm vinblastine, or 30 μm rhodamine B for 24 h. Whole cell SDS extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels) and immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibody A52 (18Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Digestion with endoglycosidase H (Endo Hf) or peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Mississauga, ON) were performed as described previously (19Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Purification of P-gp and Measurement of ATPase Activity—Histidine-tagged P-gps were expressed in HEK 293 cells and then isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography as described previously (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Recovery of P-gp was monitored by immunoblot analysis with rabbit anti-P-gp polyclonal antibody (14Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A sample of the isolated histidine-tagged P-gp was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Type II-S, Sigma) that had been washed and suspended in Tris-buffered saline. The sample was sonicated, and ATPase activity measured in the presence of various concentrations of verapamil.Disulfide Cross-linking Analysis—The double cysteine mutants L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7), G64R(TM1)/L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7), M68R(TM1)/L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7), or V71R(TM1)/L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7) were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. Membranes were prepared as described previously (21Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and suspended in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. A sample of the membrane was then incubated in the presence or absence of various concentrations of vinblastine, cyclosporin A, or rhodamine B for 15 min at 20 °C. The samples were then cooled on ice for 10 min and treated with 0.2 mm concentrations of the homobifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linker 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1,14-diylbis-methanethiosulfonate (M14M, 20.8 Å) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, ON) for 4 min on ice (9Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32043-32052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 4% (w/v) SDS) containing 50 mm EDTA and no reducing agent. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels) and immunoblot analysis with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp. Intramolecular disulfide cross-linking between TMD1 and TMD2 can be detected because the cross-linked product migrates with a slower mobility on SDS-PAGE gels (23Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The gel lanes were scanned, and the amount of cross-linked product was quantitated using the NIH Image program (available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image1) and an Apple computer.RESULTSEffect of TM1 Arginines on Maturation of Processing Mutant G251V—The crystal structure of the bacterial ABC drug transporter Sav1866 showed that the 12 TM segments of the transport complex surrounded a funnel-shaped chamber exposed to the extracellular environment (24Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). The structure of Sav1866 likely resembles P-gp because they both can interact with similar drug substrates such as doxorubicin, vinblastine, and Hoechst 33342, and P-gp also contains 12 TM segments (Fig. 1A). Cross-linking analyses of P-gp also suggest that the structures are similar. For example, cross-linking analyses showed that P-gp was similar to Sav1866 because cysteines in NBD1 could be cross-linked to cysteines introduced into the fourth intracellular loop in TMD2 (25Zolnerciks J.K. Wooding C. Linton K.J. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3937-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Another structural similarity obtained by cross-linking analysis was that TM segments 2 and 5 in P-gp were found to lie next to TMs 11 and 8, respectively (26Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7692-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18232-18238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), an arrangement consistent with the structure of Sav1866. Cross-linking analysis of P-gps 12 TM segments also suggest that they also surround a funnel-shaped chamber exposed to the extracellular environment (28Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). At least part of the chamber may be filled with (12Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12081-12089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or is accessible to water (12Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12081-12089Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have changed the predicted organization of the TM segments for P-gp (9Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32043-32052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to resemble Sav1866 (Fig. 1B). The first two TM segments of each TMD are now closely associated with the last four TM segments of the opposite TMD. The recent crystal structure of another bacterial ABC transporter showing homology to P-gp, MsbA, showed a similar arrangement of the TM segments (29Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar).We previously observed that introduction of arginines into TM segments such as L65R (TM1), T199R(TM3), I306R(TM5), and F343R(TM6) promoted maturation of P-gp processing mutants (9Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32043-32052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Arginines were introduced into these positions because cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and modification with thiol-reactive drug substrates suggested that they lined the drug binding domain. Covalent modification of cysteines at positions 65 (TM1), 199 (TM3), 306 (TM5), or 343 (TM6) caused activation of P-gp ATPase activity (30Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50136-50141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20449-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study we tested whether arginines can be accommodated at other positions in a TM segment of P-gp. The first TM segment (TM1) was selected for arginine-scanning mutagenesis because the extracellular loop connecting TM1 and TM2 contains three glycosylation sites (Fig. 1A) that can act as reporters for monitoring correct insertion of the TM segment into the membrane. TM1 also lines the drug binding domain (31Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and introduction of an arginine at position 65 efficiently promoted maturation of a processing mutant (9Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32043-32052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). If an arginine mutation prevents insertion of the TM segment into the lipid bilayer, then no core glycosylation would take place. The glycosylation sites can also act as reporter molecules for monitoring subsequent folding of the protein as the addition of complex carbohydrates occurs in the Golgi. Maturation of P-gp can easily be monitored by immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts as unglycosylated, immature, and mature forms of P-gp migrate as 140, 150, and 170 kDa proteins, respectively.If the arginines were introduced into TM1 of a processing mutant that shows partial maturation (both 150 and 170 kDa detectable in cells), then it would be possible to detect whether the introduced arginine inhibits maturation (decrease the relative level of 170 kDa P-gp), promotes maturation (increase the relative level of 170 kDa P-gp), or has no effect. Therefore, processing mutant G251V was selected for analysis as it shows inefficient maturation relative to wild-type P-gp (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1724-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The G251V mutation is located in the first intracellular loop (see Fig. 1A).Accordingly, single arginine mutations were introduced at positions 52-72 of TM1. Residues 52-72 of TM1 likely spans the membrane based on the hydropathy plots of the amino acid sequence (34Chen C.J. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 381-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar) and alignment of the sequences with those from the crystal structures of the homologous bacterial ABC transporters Sav1866 and MsbA (29Ward A. Reyes C.L. Yu J. Roth C.B. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 19005-19010Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar).HEK 293 cells were transfected with the mutant cDNAs, and whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2A). In wild-type P-gp, the major product was the 170-kDa mature protein. Immunoblot analysis of the G251V processing mutant, however, showed that the major product was the 150-kDa immature protein along with a minor amount (about 20%) of mature 170-kDa product (Fig. 2). The most common effect of introducing arginines into mutant G251V was to reduce the level of mature P-gp (12 of 21 mutants). Most of the arginines in the cytoplasmic end of TM1 (residues 53-60, 62, and 63) inhibited maturation of the mutant. Fig. 2 shows that the presence of an arginine at these positions reduced the level of mature product in mutant G251V from about 20% to less than 5% (Fig. 2B). Introduction of arginines at positions 52 or 61 had little effect on maturation of G251V P-gp. Introduction of arginines at the extracellular half of TM1 (positions 64, 65, 68, and 71), however, increased maturation of mutant G251V. Mutants M68R and L65R showed the highest increase in maturation efficiency (85 and 60% mature 170-kDa mature, respectively) (Fig. 2). Mutants G64R and V71R showed maturation efficiencies of about 45%. Introduction of arginines at other positions at the extracellular end of TM1 had little effect (10-20% mature P-gp in mutants L67R, M69R, and L70R) or reduced the level of mature product to less than 10% of total P-gp (mutants P66R and F72R).FIGURE 2Effect of TM1 arginine mutations on maturation of the G251V processing mutant. A, immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts of HEK 293 cells expressing no P-gp (Control), wild-type P-gp (Wild-type), or a G251V processing mutant containing the indicated TM1 arginine mutations. The positions of mature (170 kDa) and immature (150 kDa) forms of P-gp are indicated. B, the amount of mature P-gp (170-kDa protein) relative to total (mature 170-kDa plus immature 150-kDa protein) was quantitated by scanning the gel lanes followed by analysis with the NIH Image program (available at rsb.info.nih.gov.nih-image) and an Apple Macintosh computer. Each value is the mean ± S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutants G251V, V53R/G251V (inhibited maturation) and M68R/G251V (enhanced maturation) were subjected endoglycosidase H or F digestion to determine whether the alterations in mobility of the mutant P-gps were indeed due to changes in the glycosylation state of the protein. Endoglycosidase H only cleaves core-glycosylated proteins, whereas endoglycosidase F removes core or complex carbohydrate. Fig. 3 shows that the 150-kDa immature protein was sensitive to both endoglycosidases, whereas the 170-kDa protein was only sensitive to endoglycosidase F. These results indicate that the 150-kDa immature proteins were only core-glycosylated, whereas the 170-kDa mature proteins were processed in the Golgi. Cell-surface labeling studies showed that only the mature 170-kDa protein was labeled (data not shown) and confirmed the previous observation that the 170-kDa protein was at the cell surface (8Loo T.W.

Chem. 2007; 282: 32043-32052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with the other arginine mutants (data not shown). These results suggest that the introduced arginines did not prevent insertion of TM1 into the lipid bilayer.FIGURE 3Treatment of P-gp mutants with endoglycosidases. Whole cell SDS extracts of HEK 293 cells expressing A52-tagged mutants G251V, V53R/G251V, or M68R/G251V were treated with endoglycosidase Hf (H), peptide N-glycosidase F (F) or no endoglycosidase (-). Equivalent amounts were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The positions of the mature (170 kDa), immature (150 kDa), and unglycosylated (140 kDa) P-gps are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because the M68R mutation was most efficient in promoting maturation of the G251V processing mutant, we tested whether it could also promote maturation of a different processing mutant. Accordingly, the M68R mutation was introduced into the ΔNBD2-P-gp processing mutant (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The ΔNBD2-P-gp processing mutant does not mature as it lacks the last 257 amino acids that form NBD2 (see Fig. 1A). Mutants ΔNBD2-P-gp, M68R/ΔNBD2-P-gp, and ΔNBD2-P-gp lacking the three glycosylation sites (N91A, N94A, N99A) were expressed in HEK 293 cells, and whole cell SDS extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 4 shows that the M68R mutant yielded an extra P-gp protein that corresponded in size to the mature protein (Fig. 4). Treatment with endoglycosidases H and F showed that the immature form (100 kDa) was sensitive to endoglycosidases H and F, whereas the slower migrating M68R protein (115 kDa) was sensitive to endoglycosidase F but not endoglycosidase H (data not shown).FIGURE 4Effect of the M68R mutation on maturation of the ΔNBD2 processing mutant. Whole cell extracts of HEK 293 cells expressing mutants ΔNBD2-P-gp with no changes (None), the M68R mutation, or N91A, N94A and N99A changes to the glycosylation sites (Unglycos) were subjected to immunoblot analysis.

Expression of P-gp processing mutants in the presence of drug substrates such as cyclosporin A, verapamil, vinblastine, or rhodamine B promotes maturation of the protein (5Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J.

Therefore, mutants showing reduced (T55R/G251V) or similar maturation efficiencies (H61R/G251V, M69R/G251V) to the G251V parent were expressed in the presence of 5 μm cyclosporin A, 30 μm verapamil, 5 μm vinblastine, or 30 μm rhodamine B.

https://openalex.org/W1985713898,"Analysis of RNA editing in plant mitochondria has at least in vitro been hampered by very low activity. Consequently, none of the trans-acting factors involved has yet been identified. We here report that in vitro RNA editing increases dramatically when additional cognate recognition motifs are introduced into the template RNA molecule. Substrate RNAs with tandemly repeated recognition elements enhance in vitro RNA editing from 2-3% to 50-80%. The stimulation is not influenced by the editing status of a respective RNA editing site, suggesting that specific recognition of a site can be independent of the edited nucleotide itself. In vivo, attachment of the editing complex may thus be analogously initiated at sequence similarities in the vicinity of bona fide editing sites. This cis-acting enhancement decreases with increasing distance between the duplicated specificity signals; a cooperative effect is detectable up to approximately 200 nucleotides. Such repeated template constructs promise to be powerful tools for the RNA affinity identification of the as yet unknown trans-factors of plant mitochondrial RNA editing."

The helicase domain of the enzyme, located in the carboxyl-terminal region, shares high homology with helicases from superfamily 4 (SF4), which includes bacteriophage T7 gene 4 protein (T7 gp4) and Escherichia coli DnaB protein. These enzymes catalyze DNA helix unwinding, translocating 5′-3′ on single-stranded DNA by utilizing the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis (10Singleton M.R. Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Annu. Rev.

Furthermore, the extreme carboxyl-terminal region of many SF4 helicases has been shown to be required for interaction with other replication factors. Carboxyl-terminal residues of T7 gp4 interact directly with T7 DNA polymerase and thioredoxin, and the last three carboxyl-terminal residues in the RSF1010 plasmid-encoded RepA helicase are required for replication in vivo (23Hamdan S.M.

We have shown that the Drosophila (d-) mtDNA helicase is essential for mtDNA maintenance in vivo, and overexpression of protein variants carrying mutations in the H1 or H2 motifs or those with amino acid substitutions equivalent to human autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia mutations results in the depletion of mtDNA in cultured cells (13Matsushima Y. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9436-9444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, similar results were obtained with human cultured cells (29Wanrooij S.

Here, we extend our study by investigating the importance of the carboxyl-terminal region. We evaluate the effects of overexpression in Drosophila cell culture of variants carrying mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region and characterize biochemically several recombinant human helicases carrying amino acid substitutions that are shown to cause dominant negative phenotypes in vivo. Generation and Induction of Stable Cell Lines—Drosophila Schneider S2 cells were cultured at 25 °C in Drosophila Schneider Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were subcultured to 5 × 106 cells/ml every third day. Cells were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen). Hygromycin-resistant cells were selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin. Cells were passed at least five times in hygromycin-containing medium and then cultured in standard medium. The cell lines were grown to a density of 3 × 106/ml and then treated with 0.2 mm CuSO4 to induce high level expression from the metallothionein promoter. Immunoblotting—Total cellular protein (20 μg/lane) was fractionated by SDS-PAGE in 9% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were preincubated for 1 h with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by incubation for 1 h with d-mtDNA helicase antibody (1:20 ml in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20). Filters were washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad), and washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Protein bands were visualized using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the Drosophila ATPase β subunit was provided by Rafael Garesse (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, Madrid). Protein Cross-linking Analysis—1 × 108 cells that were induced with 0.2 mm CuSO4 for 7 days were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 200 μl cross-linking buffer (PBS containing 1% formaldehyde). After incubation for 5 min at room temperature, 200 μl of quenching solution (PBS containing 250 mm glycine, 10 mm EDTA, and 4% SDS) was added, and the samples were mixed thoroughly. 20 μl of the protein solution was fractionated by 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described above. Southern Blotting—Genomic DNA was purified from Drosophila Schneider S2 cells by standard methods. DNA (10 μg/lane) was cleaved with XhoI, fractionated on a 0.7% agarose/Tris-buffered EDTA gel, and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed as described previously (31Matsushima Y. Adan C. Garesse R. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol.

Filters were washed 3 times for 10 min at room temperature with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, once for 30 min at 65 °C with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS, and then analyzed with a PhosphorImager. Blots were probed with radiolabeled DNAs for the mitochondrial gene Cytb and the nuclear histone gene cluster. The ratio of the signals for these two genes was used to determine the relative copy number of mtDNA. The Southern blot experiments shown in Figs. 2 and 4 were performed twice with each of the two independent cell lines carrying each plasmid construct, including the control (no plasmid), vector only, wild type, and each of the mutant d-mtDNA helicases. The data presented represent one such experiment, and quantitation is provided for the duplicate experiments from one of the two cell lines. All of the comparable data for each construct vary by less than 15%.FIGURE 4Expression in Schneider cells of Drosophila mtDNA helicases carrying mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region. Schneider cells containing no plasmid (control) or carrying pMt/WT/Hy (WT), pMt/K576A/Hy (K576A), pMt/R576A/Hy (R576A), pMt/Y577A/Hy (Y577A), pMt/D580A/Hy (D580A), pMt/E587A/Hy (E587A), pMt/F588A/Hy (F588A), pMt/K590A/Hy (K590A), or pMt/Y595A/Hy (Y595A) were cultured for 14 days in the absence or presence of 0.2 mm CuSO4. A, protein extracts (20 μg) were fractionated by 9% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and probed with affinity-purified rabbit antiserum against d-mtDNA helicase or antiserum against d-ATPase β as indicated. B, total mtDNA (10 μg) was extracted from Schneider cells (control) or Schneider cells carrying pMt/K576A/Hy (K576A), pMt/R576A/Hy (R576A), pMt/Y577A/Hy (Y577A), pMt/D580A/Hy (D580A), pMt/E587A/Hy (E587A), pMt/F588A/Hy (F588A), pMt/K590A/Hy (K590A), or pMt/Y595A/Hy (Y595A) were cultured for 14 days in the presence of 0.2 mm CuSO4. DNA was digested with XhoI, fractionated in a 0.7% agarose/Tris-buffered EDTA gel, and then blotted to a nylon membrane. The membrane was hybridized with a radiolabeled probe for the histone gene cluster (his genes) and then stripped and re-hybridized with radiolabeled probe for CytB (mtDNA).

Protein Overexpression and Purification of the Human mtDNA Helicase and Its Variants—Amino-terminal hexahistidine-tagged human mtDNA helicase and mutants, R609A, F621A, and F628A were produced by overexpression in Spodoptera frugiperda cells and purified to homogeneity as described by Ziebarth et al. (12Ziebarth T.D. Farr C.L. Kaguni L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1382-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ATPase Assay—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, 100 μm DNase I-activated calf thymus DNA, and amino-terminal His-tagged full-length mtDNA helicase, or the R609A, F621A, or F628A mutants. Incubation was for 15 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by placing the reaction tubes on ice. Aliquots (2 μl) were spotted onto Polygram polyethyleneimine cellulose paper with 0.5 μl of 50 mm ADP/ATP. The Polygram polyethyleneimine cellulose paper was developed in 1 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl. The position of both ADP and ATP bands was visualized by ultraviolet light. The corresponding bands were isolated, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Structural Modeling—Human mtDNA helicase shares significant sequence homology with the T7 gp4 protein within the helicase domain (1Spelbrink J.N. Li F.Y. Tiranti V. Nikali K. Yuan Q.P. Tariq M. Wanrooij S. Garrido N. Comi G. Morandi L. Santoro L. Toscano A. Fabrizi G.M. Somer H. Croxen R. Beeson D. Poulton J. Suomalainen A. Jacobs H.T. Zeviani M. Larsson C. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Using the crystal structure of the T7 gp4 helicase (PDB code 1EOJ (18Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar)) as the template, we developed a homology model of the three-dimensional structure of human mtDNA helicase domain (residues 383-634) based on multiple sequence alignment by ClustalW among homologs from humans, mouse, and fly with the T7 gp4 helicase domain (residues 281-549) and in consideration of structural conservation among known crystal structures of DnaB-like helicases (33Niedenzu T. Roleke D. Bains G. Scherzinger E. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The homology model was constructed using Xfit software (34McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Carboxyl-terminal Deletion Mutants of Drosophila mtDNA Helicase in Schneider Cells—To examine the role of the carboxyl-terminal region of the d-mtDNA helicase, we created four variants of the enzyme lacking 7, 17, 28, or 42 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1). The constructs were transfected into Schneider cells, and after a 14-day incubation in the presence of 0.2 mm CuSO4, an immunoblot analysis revealed a 10-20-fold increase in the levels of the wild type, Δ(607-613) mutant, and Δ(597-613) mutant relative to the endogenous d-mtDNA helicase level (Fig. 2A). The ATP synthase β subunit probed as a control showed no significant change in expression level. Cell lines expressing the Δ(586-613) and Δ(572-613) mutants showed increases of only 1.5- and 1.3-fold, respectively, relative to the endogenous d-mtDNA helicase level. As a result, we could not isolate high level expression cell lines for these two variants. The effects of overexpression of the d-mtDNA helicase deletion mutants on mtDNA maintenance were examined in cells expressing the mutants. To determine the mtDNA copy number, total cellular DNA was isolated, cleaved with XhoI, and analyzed by Southern blot (see “Experimental Procedures”). Blots were hybridized sequentially with probes for the nuclear histone gene cluster and the mitochondrial gene CytB. Relative mtDNA copy number was determined from the ratio of CytB hybridization to histone gene cluster hybridization. After 14 days of induction, the relative mtDNA copy number was increased 1.2-fold in cells overexpressing the wild type enzyme as compared with the control cells (Fig. 2B). In the case of the overexpression of the Δ(607-613) and Δ(597-613) mutants, the relative mtDNA copy number was increased to 105-120% that of the control cells, values that are comparable with the wild type-overexpressing cells. In contrast, in the cells overexpressing the Δ(586-613) and Δ(572-613) mutants, the relative mtDNA copy number was decreased to 57-65% that of the control despite their very low levels of expression. These results indicate that the region between 572 and 596 is essential for helicase function. d-mtDNA Helicase Deletion Mutants Form Hexamers—To explain the dominant negative effects we observed in the Schneider cells overexpressing the d-mtDNA helicase deletion mutants, we examined the oligomeric state of the overexpressed proteins. To do so, we induced stable cell lines carrying either no construct or the wild type or mutant constructs for 7 days in the presence of 0.2 mm CuSO4. Cells were harvested and treated with formaldehyde to cross-link the proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoblot analysis after native gel electrophoresis of the wild type d-mtDNA helicase revealed monomers, dimers, and hexamers (Fig. 3A, lane 2), whereas the endogenous protein in cells carrying no construct was undetectable under these conditions (lane 1). Analysis of the deletion mutants (lanes 3 and 4) showed that the efficiency of hexamer formation with the Δ(607-613) and Δ(597-613) mutants is nearly equivalent to that of the overexpressed wild type protein. Because of the low level of expression of the Δ(586-613) mutants, we were unable to detect multimeric helicase forms using the formaldehyde cross-linking analysis. However, upon velocity sedimentation of these two mutants from mitochondrial extracts of Schneider cells, we found them to have sedimentation coefficients similar to endogenous mtDNA helicase (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the dominant-negative phenotype and mtDNA depletion observed in Drosophila Schneider cells expressing these deletion mutants also results from the formation of functionally defective heterohexamers. Overexpression of Carboxyl-terminal Point Mutants of the d-mtDNA Helicase in Schneider Cells—In the carboxyl-terminal region between amino acids 572 and 596 of the d-mtDNA helicase, eight charged or aromatic amino acids, Lys-574, Arg-576, Tyr-577, Asp-580, Glu-587, Phe-588, Lys-590, and Tyr-595, are well conserved between the various mtDNA helicases aligned in Fig. 1. Arg-576 and Phe-588 of the d-mtDNA helicase are analogous to the arginine finger, Arg-522, and base stack, Tyr-535, of T7 gp4, respectively. To examine their physiological significance in the mitochondrial enzyme, we constructed metallothionein-inducible plasmids expressing eight d-mtDNA helicase variants carrying the alanine substitutions K574A, R576A, Y577A, D580A, E587A, F588A, K590A, and Y595A. The constructs were transfected into Schneider cells, and two independent stable cell lines were established for each of them. After 14 days of incubation in the absence or presence of 0.2 mm CuSO4, immunoblot analysis indicated increases in the levels of all of the variants in the range of 2.5-3.5- and 12-20-fold, respectively, relative to the control cell lines (Fig. 4A). At the same time, the ATP synthase β subunit showed no significant change in expression levels. Cross-linking analysis of the mutants as described above showed that all were capable of forming hexamers (Fig. 3B). Next, we evaluated their effects on mtDNA maintenance. In cells overexpressing the putative arginine finger mutant R576A, the relative mtDNA copy number was reduced to 70 and 9% of the control cells (Fig. 4B), correlating with the 3- and 20-fold overexpression of R576A in the absence and presence of induction, respectively. Similarly, overexpression of the putative base stack mutant F588A resulted in a 7-fold decrease in mtDNA copy number upon induction. These data are comparable with those we obtained using cells overexpressing the Walker A and Walker B active-site mutants (13Matsushima Y. Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9436-9444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition to the putative arginine finger and base stack mutants, we found 20- and 9-fold decreases in relative mtDNA copy number in cells overexpressing the K574A and Y595A variants, respectively, and cells overexpressing Y577A showed a 2-fold decrease relative to the control cells. In contrast, in cells overexpressing D580A, E587A, and K590A, the relative mtDNA copy number was increased to 114-135% that of the control upon induction, values that are comparable with those we obtained upon overexpression of the wild type d-mtDNA helicase. Correspondingly, whereas copper induction had no adverse effects on the growth of cells expressing the Y577A, D580A, E587A, and K590A mutants, cells expressing the K574A, R576A, F588A, and Y595A mutants grew very poorly. After 4 weeks of induction, the mtDNA levels in the latter mutants decreased to an undetectable level and produced a lethal phenotype between 4 to 6 weeks (data not shown). ATPase Activities of the Human mtDNA Helicase and Its Variants—To evaluate biochemically mutants producing dominant negative phenotypes in Drosophila cells, we produced recombinant human proteins carrying alanine substitutions at analogous positions: R609A, F621A, and F628A. Consistent with the dominant negative effects seen in vivo for the Drosophila Arg-576, Phe-588, and Tyr-595 helicase mutants, the human R609A variant lacks ATP hydrolysis activity, and the F621A and F628A mutants exhibit 10- and 4-fold decreases in activity, respectively (Fig. 5). These data indicate that in addition to an arginine finger at amino acid Arg-609 and a base stack at Phe-621, amino acid Phe-628 also serves a role in the nucleotide hydrolysis reaction.

PIOX belongs to the fatty acid α-dioxygenase family, which exhibits homology to cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2). Although these enzymes share common catalytic features, including the use of a tyrosine radical during catalysis, little is known about other residues involved in the dioxygenase reaction of PIOX. We generated a model of linoleic acid (LA) bound to PIOX based on computational sequence alignment and secondary structure predictions with COX-1 and experimental observations that governed the placement of carbon-2 of LA below the catalytic Tyr-379. Examination of the model identified His-311, Arg-558, and Arg-559 as potential molecular determinants of the dioxygenase reaction. Substitutions at His-311 and Arg-559 resulted in mutant constructs that retained virtually no oxygenase activity, whereas substitutions of Arg-558 caused only moderate decreases in activity. Arg-559 mutant constructs exhibited increases of greater than 140-fold in Km, whereas no substantial change in Km was observed for His-311 or Arg-558 mutant constructs. Thermal shift assays used to measure ligand binding affinity show that the binding of LA is significantly reduced in a Y379F/R559A mutant construct compared with that observed for Y379F/R558A construct. Although Oryza sativa PIOX exhibited oxygenase activity against a variety of 14-20-carbon fatty acids, the enzyme did not oxygenate substrates containing modifications at the carboxylate, carbon-1, or carbon-2. Taken together, these data suggest that Arg-559 is required for high affinity binding of substrates to PIOX, whereas His-311 is involved in optimally aligning carbon-2 below Tyr-379 for catalysis.

Pathogen attack on plants brings about the activation of multiple enzyme systems that results in the production of oxylipins from 18-22 carbon fatty acid precursors. The generation of these bioactive lipid mediators initiates and sustains the defense reaction of the plant against insects, bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens (1Creelman R.A. Mullet J.E. Annu. Rev.

Int. Congr. Ser. 2002; 1233: 307-317Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) showed that the dioxygenation catalyzed by PIOX resulted in the stereoselective removal of the 2-pro-R hydrogen from carbon-2 of the fatty acid substrate, followed by the stereospecific addition of molecular oxygen. Interestingly, the reaction catalyzed by PIOX differs from that observed for plant lipoxygenases and the COX enzymes in that a saturated region of the fatty acid substrate is targeted for oxygen addition (10Liu W.

Ponce de Leon I. Sanz A. Castresana C. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Liu W. Rogge C.E. Bambai B. Palmer G. Tsai A.L. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29805-29815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Three residues crucial for activity in the COX enzymes are strictly conserved within the family; the distal and proximal histidines involved in heme binding (His-207 and His-388, respectively) and Tyr-385, which is responsible for initiation of the cyclooxygenase reaction via hydrogen abstraction (17Garavito R.M. Malkowski M.G. DeWitt D.L. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The complete conservation of these residues within the fatty acid α-dioxygenase family suggested that the dioxygenation carried out by PIOX was initiated by the conserved tyrosine and that all of these proteins bound a heme prosthetic group (5Hamberg M. Ponce de Leon I. Sanz A. Castresana C. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Subsequent mutagenesis of the equivalent residues in A. thaliana PIOX (His-163, Tyr-386, and His-389) and O. sativa PIOX (His-157, Tyr-379, and His-382) resulted in mutant proteins that lacked or had significantly reduced ability to consume oxygen, confirming their critical roles in catalysis (3Sanz A.

Liu and colleagues (10Liu W. Rogge C.E. Bambai B. Palmer G. Tsai A.L. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29805-29815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) have extensively characterized the heme environment of A. thaliana PIOX using spectroscopic, mutagenic, and functional assays to investigate its connection with oxygenase catalysis. Although the heme does play a functional role via the initiation of catalysis, they surmise that the reduced peroxidase activity observed for PIOX is likely a result of restricted access to the distal face of the ferric heme due to a large insert that is present in the PIOX sequence, but lacking in COX-1, COX-2, and other myeloperoxidase family members (10Liu W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 29805-29815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Previous biophysical studies and functional analyses have utilized sequence comparisons between the COX enzymes and PIOX to both identify the catalytic residues His-157, Tyr-379, and His-382, and confirm the necessity of these residues for optimal oxygenation of fatty acids by PIOX. Although these studies have been proven to establish that PIOX and the COX enzymes share a basic overall mechanism of catalysis, they have been lacking in the identification of additional residues within PIOX that participate in the dioxygenation reaction. Significant characterization of the residues that line the cyclooxygenase channel of COX-1 and COX-2 has been carried out and molecular determinants governing substrate binding, stabilization, specificity, and product formation have been identified (17Garavito R.M.

These studies were aided by the use of both computational and experimentally derived structural models to guide and validate functional characterizations.We report here studies designed to identify additional residues within the O. sativa PIOX active site that play a role in the α-dioxygenation of fatty acids and to characterize the substrate specificity of the enzyme. Bioinformatics techniques were used to construct a model of O. sativa PIOX, and subsequent analysis of the model identified a putative hydrophobic groove below Tyr-379 into which LA was placed and minimized utilizing experimentally derived constraints. Based on the model of LA bound in the groove of PIOX, we identified candidate residues that could potentially interact with the carboxylate of the fatty acid substrate, performed site-directed mutagenesis, and followed with functional analyses to characterize the effect each mutant had on its ability to bind and oxygenate LA. We also determined the substrate specificity of O. sativa PIOX toward a variety of 14-20-carbon fatty acids with varying levels of unsaturation, and tested the ability of the enzyme to bind and oxygenate fatty acids with modifications to the carboxylate, carbon-1, or carbon-2 of the substrate.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Linoleic acid (9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid), α-linolenic acid (9Z,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid), dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid), arachidonic acid (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid), γ-linolenic acid (6Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoic acid), eicosapentaneoic acid (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z-eicosapentaenoic acid), 11Z,14Z-eicosadienoic acid, stearidonic acid (6Z,9Z,12Z,15Z-octadecatetraenoic acid), eicosatrienoic acid (5Z,8Z,11Z-eicosatrienoic acid), oleic acid (9Z-octadecaenoic acid), linoelaidic acid (9E,12E-octadecadienoic acid), 9,12-octadecadiynoic acid, palmitic acid (hexadecanoic acid), pinolenic acid (5Z,9Z,12Z-octadecatrienoic acid), and 2-linoleoyl glycerol (9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid, 2-glyceryl ester) were purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). 11Z-Eicosenoic acid, stearic acid (octadecanoic acid), palmitoleic acid (9Z-hexadecaenoic acid), myristic acid (tetradecanoic acid), methyl linolenic acid (methyl 9Z,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienoic acid), methyl linoleic acid (methyl 9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid), methyl oleic acid (methyl 9Z-octadecenoic acid), 2-methyloctadecanoic acid, and SYPRO Orange were purchased from Sigma. Decyl maltoside (C10M) was purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH) and TALON metal affinity resin was purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA).

Each constructed mutant was verified by DNA sequence analysis.Protein Expression and Purification—Wild-type and mutant constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli (strain M15) and purified as described in Ref. 27Lloyd T. Krol A.C. Campanaro D.M. Malkowski M.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar. The purified mutant proteins were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% C10M. Cells containing an empty pQE-30 vector were induced and carried through purification for use as a negative control and to establish a baseline for oxygen consumption measurements.Western Blotting—Purified wild-type and mutant proteins were resolved on a 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a Semi-Dry Transfer Apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, and Tris-buffered saline and rocked at 4 °C overnight, followed by four 5-min washes with TBST (1% dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20). The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were then probed for 1 h with a 1:2000 dilution of a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against polyhistidine tags (Sigma). Following incubation, the membranes were washed and probed with a 1:2000 dilution of rabbit anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 30 min. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were then washed and immunodetection was carried out using ECL chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd.) followed by exposure to film.Oxygenase Activity Assay—The enzymatic activity of wild-type and mutant O. sativa PIOX proteins was tested by measuring the initial rate of O2 uptake at 30 °C using a YSI model 5300 biological oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH), equipped with an oxygen electrode. Each standard assay mixture contained 3 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 500 μm LA as the substrate. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 2-17 μg of protein in a volume of 5-20 μl. Km and Vmax values for native and mutant proteins were determined by measuring oxygen uptake using 1-500 μm LA and fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Graph-Pad Prism 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For substrate specificity studies, 100 μm substrate was utilized in the assay and carried out as described above.Thermal Shift Assay—Thermal shift assays were performed using the Stratagene Mx3005P real-time PCR instrument (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Y379F, Y379F/R558A, and Y379F/R559A mutant constructs were added to a final concentration of 1 μm in a 30-μl total reaction volume containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and 0-50 μm fatty acid. SYPRO Orange was added as a fluorescence reporter at a 1000-fold dilution from its stock solution. The change in fluorescence was monitored using the Cy3 filter, with excitation and emission wavelengths of 545 and 568 nm, respectively. Temperature was raised from 25 to 98 °C in 0.5 °C intervals over the course of 45 min, with fluorescence readings taken at each interval. The fluorescence data were plotted, normalized, and the first derivative of the curve calculated to provide the melting temperature (Tm) using GraphPad Prism 5.0 as detailed in Ref. 28Yeh A.P. McMillan A. Stowell M.H. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar. The change in melting temperature (ΔTm) was calculated as the difference between the Tm of the mutant construct in the presence of fatty acid compared with the mutant construct alone.Secondary Structure Prediction and Homology Modeling—Prediction of the secondary structural elements of O. sativa PIOX were carried out using the PSIPRED protein structure prediction server (29Jones D.T.

Confidence levels reported for the prediction of helices in the sequence were calculated by adding the numerical “confidence indicator” assigned by the program for each residue within a predicted helix (a value ranging from 0 to 9, with 9 relating to the highest confidence), computing an average, and dividing by the maximum confidence level (29Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4382) Google Scholar, 30McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2663) Google Scholar).For homology modeling, the O. sativa PIOX protein sequence was submitted to a structure prediction metaserver (31Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), in which O. aries COX-1 (Protein Data Bank code 1DIY (32Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.L. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar)) was found among the best-ranking homologous proteins and a corresponding sequence to structure alignment was retrieved. The alignment covered 74% of the input sequence with the average sequence identity between aligned segments equal to 19.8%. The output alignment was subsequently used by the program MODELLER (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10384) Google Scholar) to construct a homology model of PIOX. A model of the enzyme-substrate complex was built by importing the structure of LA into the PIOX homology model. LA was manually docked such that carbon-2 of the fatty acid substrate was placed ∼2.8 Å below the hydroxyl group of Tyr-379. This constraint is based on: 1) the experimental observation by Hamberg and colleagues (16Hamberg M. Sanz A. Castresana C. Int. Congr. Ser. 2002; 1233: 307-317Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) that the 2-pro-R hydrogen of fatty acid substrate is abstracted by a tyrosyl radical centered on Tyr-379 of PIOX to initiate catalysis; and 2) by the distances observed between the hydroxyl group of Tyr-385 and carbon-13 in the cocrystal structures of COX-1 with fatty acid substrates (20Malkowski M.G. Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Rieke C.J. Micielli R. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37547-37555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Thuresson E.D.

Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The conformation of LA within the PIOX model was further energy minimized using the Amber7 molecular modeling package (34Case D.A. Cheatham III, T.E. Darden T. Gohlke H. Luo R. Merz Jr., K.M. Onufriev A. Simmerling C. Wang B. Woods R. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1668-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (6331) Google Scholar), with the distance between the hydroxyl group of Tyr-379 and carbon-2 of LA fixed as defined above. Finally, the entire hydrophobic pocket, consisting of a 5-Å radius around and including LA, was energy minimized, with no additional distance constraints beyond that defined above for the hydroxyl of Tyr-379 and carbon-2 of LA. General Amber force field parameters were used for LA and parm99 force fields for the protein.RESULTSStructure Prediction and Identification of Candidate Residues for Mutagenesis—In the absence of an experimentally derived structure for O. sativa PIOX (27Lloyd T. Krol A.C. Campanaro D.M. Malkowski M.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 365-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we carried out structural predictions to generate a model for PIOX that could serve as the basis for the design of experiments to further study the function of the enzyme. PIOX and the COX enzymes share sequence similarity of ∼20% (3Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Hamberg M. Ponce de Leon I. Sanz A. Castresana C. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Liu W. Wang L.H. Fabian P. Hayashi Y. McGinley C.M. van der Donk W.A. Kulmacz R.J. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2006; 44: 284-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequence alignment between O. sativa PIOX and O. aries COX-1 indicates that significant sequence similarities exist between residues 123-609 of PIOX and residues 135-584 of COX-1, which corresponds to the catalytic domain of the COX enzyme (17Garavito R.M. Malkowski M.G. DeWitt D.L. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Secondary structure prediction utilizing the PSIPRED server identified 19 helical segments, with a confidence level of greater than 70% for each predicted helix, within the complete sequence of O. sativa PIOX (Fig. 1). Seventeen of the 19 predicted helices are located within residues 123-609 of O. sativa PIOX. Of the 17 helices predicted within this region, 15 align with a structurally observed helix in the catalytic domain of COX-1 (Fig. 1). A structural model for O. sativa PIOX was then independently generated with the program MODELLER (33Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10384) Google Scholar) using the crystal structure of O. aries COX-1 (PDB 1DIY) (32Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.L. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) as a template. Subsequent analysis of the in silico generated PIOX model also suggests a predominantly α-helical fold for the overall structure, which is consistent with the results obtained from the PSIPRED server. Indeed, 15 helices in the PIOX model correspond to observed helical regions in the crystal structure of COX-1. No β-sheet secondary structure was predicted with high confidence within the O. sativa PIOX sequence.Three residues crucial for activity within the catalytic domain of COX-1 and COX-2 include the distal and proximal histidines involved in heme binding (His-207 and His-388) and the catalytic tyrosine (Tyr-385; Table 1). In the crystal structure of O. aries COX-1, His-207 is located in helix H2, whereas Tyr-385 and His-388 are located in helix H8 (as defined in Ref. 35Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The analogous residues in O. sativa PIOX (His-157, Tyr-379, and His-382; Table 1), which are strictly conserved within the known PIOX sequences to date, reside in sequences that are predicted to have α-helical secondary structure by the PSIPRED server, with a confidence level greater than 95% (Fig. 1). Moreover, our PIOX structural model predicts that His-157 and His-382 lie within helices that are the equivalents to H2 and H8 in COX-1, with their side chains poised to bind the heme prosthetic group (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2048149792,"Our previous studies demonstrated that the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), induces derepression of the human luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) gene by de-recruitment of the pRB homologue p107 repressor from the promoter in JAR and MCF-7 cancer cells. TSA initiates a mechanism whereby the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase zeta (PKCzeta) cascade phosphorylates Sp1 at Ser-641, which is essential for the release of the repression of LHR transcription. The present studies have revealed that dissociation of serine/threonine protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 from the LHR promoter mediates TSA-induced activation of LHR gene transcription in a cell-specific manner. Changes in chromatin structure induced by TSA cause the release of PP2A in JAR cells or of PP1 in MCF-7 cells, which is associated with Sp1 directly or through histone deacetylase 1/2, respectively, at the promoter. This favors the phosphorylation of Sp1 mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKCzeta pathway, which in turn causes the release of the p107 inhibitor from Sp1 and marked transcriptional activation of the LHR. These findings reveal the importance of phosphatases in the control of LHR transcription, where the balance between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/PKCzeta and phosphatases could be critical for up- and down-regulation of LHR gene expression in physiological and pathological settings."

Finally, a mutant of hSnm1B stabilized independently of exogenous TRF2-induced cell death.

Telomeres are DNA/protein structures that protect the ends of chromosomes from illegitimate recombination and degradation (1Blackburn E.H. Cell. 2001; 106: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). The DNA portion of human telomeres is composed of a G-rich repeat (TTAGGG) that extends past the complementary C-rich strand, forming a 3′ extension. This extension loops back and invades the double-stranded region, forming a lariat structure termed the t-loop that is thought to play a role in telomere function (2Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). The core set of telomere proteins in humans that bind directly to telomeric DNA is composed of one protein, POT1, that binds directly to single-stranded telomeric DNA, and two proteins, TRF1 and TRF2, that bind directly to double-stranded telomeric DNA (3Liu D.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). The latter protein, TRF2, binds double-stranded telomeric DNA as a homodimer and has been shown to promote t-loop formation in vitro (2Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1905) Google Scholar). Disruption of TRF2 function leads to telomere fusions and a DNA damage response (5van Steensel B. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T.

Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). As such, TRF2 plays a critical role in the structure and function of telomeres. TRF2 also recruits a number of proteins to the telomere (4de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar), and hence understanding the relationship of these proteins to TRF2 could shed light on the central role TRF2 plays at the telomere.One such protein that binds directly to TRF2 in human cells is hSnm1B (7Freibaum B.D.

In humans, the three proteins with homology to Snm1 are Snm1A, Artemis (Snm1C), and Snm1B (Apollo) (8van Overbeek M. de Lange T. Curr.

Moreover, the stability and function of at least two other telomere-associated proteins, hTERT and TRF1, are regulated by polyubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome (25Chang W. Dynek J.N.

After 48 h, RNA was purified from the cells using the RNA-Bee reagent (Tel-Test) according to the manufacturer's instructions and reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dT) primer as previously described. Resultant cDNA was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-AACAGCCACAACGTCTATATC-3′ and 5′-AAGAAGAGACGTGCGGTGCCAG-3′ to specifically detected ectopic GFP-hSnm1B or primers 5′-GAGGTGCAGAGCGACTAC and 5′-GCTGTTCACCTGCAAATCCA to detect glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a control.RESULTSBinding to TRF2 Stabilizes hSnm1B—Given that hSnm1B binds directly to TRF2 (7Freibaum B.D.

Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15033-15036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we investigated the mechanism by which TRF2 regulates hSnm1B levels. To begin, we tested whether hSnm1B must bind TRF2 to be stabilized. To this end, 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding Flag epitope-tagged hSnm1B (Flag-hSnm1B) and Myc epitope-tagged TRF2 (Myc-TRF2) as a positive control, Flag-hSnm1B without exogenous Myc-TRF2 as a negative control, and Flag-hSnm1B2–462 lacking the last 70 amino acids that facilitate TRF2 binding, in the absence or presence of Myc-TRF2. Cells were then lysed, and immunoblotted with an α-Myc antibody to validate appropriate Myc-TRF2 expression and an α-Flag antibody to assay for Flag-hSnm1B protein levels. As already noted (7Freibaum B.D. Counter C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15033-15036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), Flag-hSnm1B levels were increased in the presence of Myc-TRF2 (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). This stabilization was lost if the TRF2 binding domain was deleted in hSnm1B, evidenced by the low levels of Flag-hSnm1B2–462 detected in both the presence and absence of Myc-TRF2 (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8). To address the possibility that deletion of the last 70 amino acids simply led to a misfolded protein, we tested if the levels of full-length hSnm1B were reduced in the presence of the mutant Myc-TRF2246–445 that lacks the N-terminal region responsible for binding hSnm1B and the C-terminal DNA binding region (7Freibaum B.D. Counter C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15033-15036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to the high levels of Flag-hSnm1B detected in the presence of Myc-TRF2 (Fig. 1, lane 3), the levels of Flag-hSnm1B in the presence of Myc-TRF2246–445 remained as low as Flag-hSnm1B in the absence of exogenous TRF2 (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 5). As the TRF2 binding domain has been mapped even further to the most terminal 37 amino acids of hSnm1B (7Freibaum B.D. Counter C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15033-15036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we validated that an hSnm1B mutant deleted for this smaller region also failed to be stabilized in the presence of Myc-TRF2 (not shown). The enhanced levels of Flag-hSnm1B did not depend upon the DNA binding activity of TRF2, as a similar experiment demonstrated that Flag-hSnm1B was still stabilized upon co-expression of the mutant Myc-TRF22–300 (31Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) that lacks the C-terminal Myb DNA binding domain (Fig. 1, lane 4). hSnm1B protein levels are thus elevated in the presence of TRF2, and moreover, the binding domains responsible for this interaction on the two proteins are required for this effect. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that TRF2 binding stabilizes hSnm1B.TRF2 Inhibits Polyubiquitination of hSnm1B—As TRF2 binding to hSnm1B stabilized the protein (Fig. 1) and the telomere-associated proteins TRF1 and hTERT are known to be polyubiquitinated and degraded (25Chang W. Dynek J.N. Smith S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1328-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 26Lee T.H. Perrem K. Harper J.W. Lu K.P. Zhou X.Z. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that binding of TRF2 prevents the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of hSnm1B. To first address whether hSnm1B is polyubiquitinated, 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-ubiquitin alone as a negative control or HA-ubiquitin and Flag-hSnm1B. Cells were lysed, Flag-hSnm1B was immunoprecipitated by virtue of the Flag epitope, and the immunoprecipitate was immunoblotted with α-Flag antibody to detect Flag-hSnm1B, and α-HA or α-ubiquitin antibodies to detect polyubiquitinated Flag-hSnm1B. Immunoprecipitated Flag-hSnm1B was readily detected by both the α-HA and α-ubiquitin antibodies as a smear, but was absent in negative control cells lacking Flag-hSnm1B (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). Thus, hSnm1B is polyubiquitinated. To explore the influence of TRF2 on hSnm1B polyubiquitination, the status of ubiquitinated Flag-hSnm1B was assessed. 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-ubiquitin, Flag-hSnm1B, and Myc-TRF2, and then immunoblotted to detect ubiquitinated and total Flag-hSnm1B. hSnm1B protein levels were normalized at loading to account for stabilization of hSnm1B by TRF2. Ectopically expressed Myc-TRF2 reduced the ratio of polyubiquitinated to total Flag-hSnm1B protein (Fig. 2, lane 3). Such data are consistent with a model by which TRF2 binding blocks polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of hSnm1B.FIGURE 2hSnm1B polyubiquitination is blocked by TRF2 binding. Flag-hSnm1B was immunoprecipitated (IP) with α-Flag antibody from lysates of 293T cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding the indicated combinations of Flag-hSnm1B, HA-ubiquitin, and Myc-TRF2 and immunoblotted (IB) with α-HA or α-ubiquitin antibodies to detect polyubiquitinated hSnm1B or α-Flag antibody to detect Flag-hSnm1B. Lysates were loaded to normalize protein levels of Flag-hSnm1B. Mock Flag immunoprecipitation serves as a control for nonspecific immunoprecipitation of ubiquitin proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The C Terminus of hSnm1B Regulates Protein Stability—As stabilization of hSnm1B required an interaction with TRF2 (Fig. 1) and this interaction blocked polyubiquitination of hSnm1B (Fig. 2), we sought to determine whether the C-terminal TRF2-interaction domain of hSnm1B was sufficient for stabilization. As the most terminal 37 amino acids of hSnm1B was the smallest region responsible for TRF2 binding and hSnm1B stabilization, we used this region for analysis. We first assessed whether this region alone imparted protein instability when fused to GFP, and whether this instability could be rescued by binding TRF2. 293T cells were therefore transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding GFP alone or with Myc-TRF2 as a control versus the C-terminal 37 amino acids of hSnm1B fused to GFP (GFP-hSnm1B496–532) alone or in the presence of Myc-TRF2. Lysates were then isolated and immunoblotted with an α-Myc antibody to validate appropriate Myc-TRF2 expression and an α-GFP antibody to assess the stability of GFP or GFP-hSnm1B496–532. GFP alone was readily detected by immunoblot, and ectopic expression of TRF2 had only a minor effect on the level of this protein (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). However, GFP-hSnm1B496–532 was nearly undetectable (Fig. 3A, lane 4), indicating that the last 37 amino acids of hSnm1B induced protein instability. Finally, co-expression of Myc-TRF2 stabilized the expression levels of GFP-hSnm1B496–532 protein (Fig. 3A, lane 5). Taken together, we conclude that the very C terminus of hSnm1B imparts protein instability, and moreover, that binding of TRF2 to the same region inhibits this effect.FIGURE 3The C terminus of hSnm1B regulates protein stability. A, top, amino acid sequence of the terminal 37 amino acids of hSnm1B. Position of the six N1-N6 mutations in which the indicated amino acids were substituted with the sequence NAAIRS are noted below with a line. Bottom, cell lysates from 293T cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding the indicated combination of GFP alone (GFP) or GFP fused to the last 37 amino acids of hSnm1B (hSnm1B496–532) in the WT or NAAIRS substitution mutation (N1-N6) configuration in the absence or presence of Myc-TRF2 were immunoblotted (IB) with an α-GFP antibody to detect GFP or GFP-hSnm1B496–532 proteins or an α-Myc antibody to detect Myc-TRF2. Mock transfection (lane 1) serves as a control for nonspecific signal. Immunoblot for β-tubulin serves as a loading control. B, cell lysates from 293T cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding Flag-hSnm1B or Flag-hSnm1BN2 in the presence of either Myc-TRF2246–445 or Myc-TRF2, were immunoblotted with anα-Flag antibody to detect Flag-hSnm1B and Flag-hSnm1BN2 or an α-Myc antibody to detect Myc-TRF2. The immunoblot for β-tubulin served as a loading control. Levels: Flag-hSnm1B levels normalized to wild-type hSnm1B in the presence of Myc-TRF2246–445.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We propose that the binding of TRF2 to the C terminus of hSnm1B may physically block ubiquitination of hSnm1B as a means to stabilize the protein. Indeed, ectopic expression of TRF2 reduced polyubiquitination of hSnm1B (Fig. 2). A prediction of this hypothesis is that there exists a sequence within the terminal 37 amino acids of hSnm1B that promotes protein instability independent of exogenous TRF2, which if mutated would stabilize hSnm1B. Thus, we screened for mutants that would stabilize GFP-hSnm1B496–532 in the absence of TRF2 by substituting every consecutive six amino acids of the encoded C-terminal 37-amino acid region of hSnm1B with the sequence NAAIRS (32Wilson I.A. Haft D.H. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Lerner R.A. Brenner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5255-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and assayed the resultant mutants for stability in the absence and presence of exogenous TRF2. 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding GFP-hSnm1B496–532 harboring one of the six NAAIRS mutants, which together span the C-terminal 37 amino acids of hSnm1B, in the absence or presence of exogenous Myc-TRF2. Resultant cell lysates were immunoblotted with an α-GFP antibody to monitor the stability of GFP-hSnm1B496–532 or mutants thereof, and an α-Myc antibody to confirm Myc-TRF2 expression. Five of these NAAIRS mutants behaved similar to the control GFP-hSnm1B496–532, being unstable unless exogenous Myc-TRF2 was present (Fig. 3A, lanes 6, 7, and 10–17). However, none of the mutants was as stable in the presence of Myc-TRF2 as the wild-type peptide, and correspondingly exhibited reduced Myc-TRF2 binding (not shown). There was one mutant termed GFP-hSnm1B496–532-N2, in which the sequence 502LKYLLT was mutated to NAAIRS, which was stable in both the absence and presence of Myc-TRF2 (Fig. 3A, lanes 8 and 9). The simplest interpretation of these data is that the sequences within the N2 region induce hSnm1B protein instability, and moreover, that binding of TRF2 to the C terminus of hSnm1B blocks the ability of this region to promote protein instability.To address whether the N2 mutation would similarly promote protein stability when introduced into full-length hSnm1B, 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding Flag-hSnm1B and Myc-TRF2246–445 that failed to bind hSnm1B as a negative control, Flag-hSnm1B and Myc-TRF2 as a positive control, and Flag-hSnm1B with the N2 mutation (Flag-hSnm1BN2), in the presence of either Myc-TRF2246–445 or Myc-TRF2, followed by immunoblot of resultant cell lysates with an α-Flag antibody to detect Flag-hSnm1B or Flag-hSnm1BN2 and α-Myc to validate appropriate Myc-TRF2 expression. As noted previously (Fig. 1), control Flag-hSnm1B was barely detectable, and this level was elevated in the presence of wild-type Myc-TRF2 (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). Flag-hSnm1BN2 was expressed in the presence of Myc-TRF2246–445 at levels approaching Flag-hSnm1B stabilized by wild-type Myc-TRF2 (Fig. 3B, lane 1 versus 3). Furthermore, Flag-hSnm1BN2 stability was not enhanced in the presence of wild-type Myc-TRF2 (Fig. 3B, lane 3 versus 4). Thus, the N2 mutation increased the stability of the full-length hSnm1B in the absence of TRF2.TRF2 Promotes Localization of hSnm1B to Telomeres—hSnm1B was unstable unless bound to TRF2, a telomere-binding protein (31Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). We thus speculated that hSnm1B not bound to TRF2 is degraded as a means of ensuring that only telomere-bound hSnm1B accumulates within cells. A prediction of this idea is that TRF2 binding should concentrate hSnm1B at telomeres. To test this, the subcellular localization of GFP-hSnm1B and GFP-hSnm1B2–495 lacking the C-terminal 37 amino acids was assessed by direct fluorescence in the absence and presence of exogenous TRF2. Specifically, 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding GFP-hSnm1B or GFP-hSnm1B2–495 in the absence or presence of Myc-TRF2, and 48-h later, punctate nuclear staining indicative of hSnm1B telomere localization (7Freibaum B.D.

https://openalex.org/W2041723639,"In alphaviruses, here represented by Semliki Forest virus, infection requires an acid-responsive spike configuration to facilitate membrane fusion. The creation of this relies on the chaperone function of glycoprotein E2 precursor (p62) and its maturation cleavage into the small external E3 and the membrane-anchored E2 glycoproteins. To reveal how the E3 domain of p62 exerts its control of spike functions, we determine the structure of a p62 cleavage-impaired mutant virus particle (SQL) by electron cryomicroscopy. A comparison with the earlier solved wild type virus structure reveals that the E3 domain of p62(SQL) forms a bulky side protrusion in the spike head region. This establishes a gripper over part of domain II of the fusion protein, with a cotter-like connection downward to a hydrophobic cluster in its central beta-sheet. This finding reevaluates the role of the precursor from being only a provider of a shield over the fusion loop to a structural playmate in formation of the fusogenic architecture."

In a recent Nature Cell Biology paper, Taddei et al., 2008Taddei I. Deugnier M.A. Faraldo M.M. Petit V. Bouvard D. Medina D. Fässler R. Thiery J.P. Glukhova M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 716-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar reveal that deletion of β1 integrin from K5-expressing mammary epithelial basal cells specifically attenuates ductal stem cell activity, without dramatically altering the basal cell layer, or morphogenesis overall. The mammary gland comprises a branching epithelial network of ducts, lined with two cell types that, together, can make and express milk. The adult epithelium is a bilayered structure, comprised of milk-producing and -secreting luminal cells and contractile basal cells that are in direct contact with the basement membrane (Figure 1). There are two distinct growth phases for the murine gland; the first is ductal outgrowth from the mammary rudiment in juvenile and pubescent mice, and the second is lobuloalveolar outgrowth from regularly spaced side-branch points during pregnancy. During growth and differentiation, the proportion of both cell types is maintained, and it is widely considered that they originate from a common bipotent stem cell/progenitor. Two years ago, studies from Stingl et al., 2006Stingl J. Eirew P. Ricketson I. Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Choi D. Li H.I. Eaves C.J. Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar and Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar and their respective colleagues produced a paradigm shift in mammary gland biology. Their work unveiled a powerful component of the organ's growth potential within the basal cell compartment. These findings differed from earlier studies that suggested that the primary source of mammary growth potential lay within the luminal compartment. However, the new basal stem cell model drew the mammary gland into line with other stratified epithelia, such as skin, which shares a common embryonic origin. A new paper from the Glukhova laboratory further explores the stem cell function of the basal epithelium, with the focus of attention on functional interactions with the subjacent basement membrane (BM) (Taddei et al., 2008Taddei I. Deugnier M.A. Faraldo M.M. Petit V. Bouvard D. Medina D. Fässler R. Thiery J.P. Glukhova M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 716-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Extracellular matrix-integrin interactions have been known for many years to have a pivotal role in determining mammary epithelial function in vitro, but have yet to be fully explored in vivo. Thus, using a conditional knockout of β1 integrin directed to the basal cell compartment, the authors have shown that, although β1 integrin is not required for the survival of basal epithelial cells, it is specifically required for maintenance of the adult ductal basal stem cell compartment, and for the normal orientation of basal cell division. Though the deletion of β1 integrin does not affect outgrowth of embryonic mammary rudiments, or the gross appearance of the basal cell population, it eliminates subsequent outgrowth of ductal trees from 1 mm3 tissue pieces, removed from adult conditional knockout trees and moved into new recipient fat pads. The use of these tissue pieces likely maintains more of the original architecture and preserves cell viability, in contrast with more commonly used tissue dissociation protocols. Various types of mammalian stem cells exhibit high levels of integrin expression, such as in skin (Jones and Watt, 1993Jones P.H. Watt F.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) and neural stem cells (Hall et al., 2006Hall P.E. Lathia J.D. Miller N.G. Caldwell M.A. ffrench-Constant C. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2078-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and integrins also play an essential role in maintaining stem cell activity in several model systems. Thus, for Drosophila testis, Tanentzapf et al., 2007Tanentzapf G. Devenport D. Godt D. Brown N.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1413-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar have shown that loss of integrin function results in the loss of both hub and stem cell populations, together with changes in the extracellular matrix. The parallels across several tissue types imply that integrin ligation is required for stem cell activity, and that activity depends upon the integrin-expressing epithelial cell binding its cognate ligand, perhaps expressed within the stem cell niche (Figure 1). Previous efforts have shown that loss of β1 integrin affects growth and differentiation of lobuloalveolar epithelial cells during pregnancy (Katz and Streuli, 2007Katz E. Streuli C.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the current paper, similar phenotypes were recapitulated, for the most part, in areas where the luminal cells exhibited β1 integrin deletion. Specifically, morphogenesis was misregulated, cell polarization was reduced, fewer branch points were observed, and the altered growth presented as thicker multilayered epithelia (described by the authors as resembling terminal end buds). Thus, in the context of lobuloalveolar differentiation, depleted or reduced β1 function impairs mammary tissue function, as measured by milk protein production and prolactin-dependent STAT5 translocation. Interestingly, the authors show that the loss of β1 integrin leads to frequent delamination of basal cells from the basement membrane into the suprabasal compartment during cell division in glands from pregnant mice. Released from β1-mediated adhesion, these cells acquire a luminal fate, or die by apoptosis (see Figure 4B in Taddei et al., 2008Taddei I. Deugnier M.A. Faraldo M.M. Petit V. Bouvard D. Medina D. Fässler R. Thiery J.P. Glukhova M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 716-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Along the same lines, β1-dependent suppression of differentiation has been demonstrated for keratinocytes in vitro (Levy et al., 2000Levy L. Broad S. Diekmann D. Evans R.D. Watt F.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). High β1 integrin expression therefore appears to be important for maintaining lineage identities and organization, and for suppressing the bipotent potential of the basal population. Indeed, by extrapolation, the absence of sufficient β1 function could lead to the mixed basal/luminal populations frequently reported in mouse breast tumors. Consistent with the hypothesis that β1 integrin-deficient mammary glands are not as normal as they appear, a previous study showed that, although mammary glands from mice with a conditional, β1 integrin mutation (directed by MMTV-cre) also showed grossly normal ductal morphogenesis, they were dramatically resistant to transformation by the Polyoma Middle T oncogene (White et al., 2004White D.E. Kurpios N.A. Zuo D. Hassell J.A. Blaess S. Mueller U. Muller W.J. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In general, in order to measure the effect of molecular perturbation on mammary gland stem and progenitor cell types, a conditional, inert, genetic tag is preferred for evaluation of cell growth and differentiation. Though Taddei et al. have tried to use their knockin lacZ reporter line (K5Cre;itgb1F/+ lacZ knockin mice) to draw conclusions about modifications of cell fate in the absence of β1 integrin, predominantly during pregnancy, these interpretations may be flawed. Since epithelial cells are known to be acutely dependent upon the dose of β1 integrin (Levy et al., 2000Levy L. Broad S. Diekmann D. Evans R.D. Watt F.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that a reduced dose of β1 integrin does not perturb the system; thus, even haploinsufficient cells are likely to suffer a strong selective disadvantage that could impact their growth and differentiation. While it may seem counterintuitive, the current data clearly indicate that even profound changes in ductal stem cell activity do not necessarily produce dramatic changes in morphogenesis and growth of mammary gland. This is likely to be true of all lineages that do not fall into the class of continuously regenerating epithelia, and may reflect a residual reservoir of embryonic cells (Paguirigan et al., 2007Paguirigan A. Beebe D.J. Alexander C.M. Cell Prolif. 2007; 40: 106-124PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, outgrowth from the embryonic mammary rudiment appears not to be affected in K5Cre;itgb1F/F mammary glands; indeed, it may be driven by K5-negative stem/progenitor cells. In contrast, expansion of the adult stem cell population does depend upon β1 integrin. Overall, this study represents an important effort to explore the impact of the surrounding microenvironment on mammary stem cell function, and raises several additional questions about the nature of these interactions (Figure 1). Of note, a simple stem cell model has been put forward recently to explain epidermal homeostasis, based upon a stochastic choice of proliferation versus nonproliferation (Jones et al., 2007Jones P.H. Simons B.D. Watt F.M. Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 371-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). If this model is applied here, together with prior data, it could be proposed that high β1 integrin expression enables more cells to stay in cycle, whereas loss of β1 creates the deficit in mammary growth potential observed by Taddei et al."
