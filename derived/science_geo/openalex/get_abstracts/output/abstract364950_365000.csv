Monfils et al. (p. 951 , published online 2 April) demonstrate that applying a standard extinction treatment (sounding the tone multiple times in the absence of any shocks) within a window of time during which reconsolidation would normally occur has the effect of overwriting the original memory. Rats treated in this fashion display much lower levels of renewal (fear induced by sounding the tone once by itself), reinstatement (fear induced by giving the shock once by itself), and spontaneous recovery."

Nanostructured materials improve the conductivity for some resistive materials, but fabricating stable materials at nanometer-length scales is difficult. Harnessing their knowledge of viruses as toolkits for materials fabrication, Lee et al. (p. 1051; published online 2 April) modified two genes in the filamentous bacteriophage M13 to produce a virus with an affinity for nucleating amorphous iron phosphate along its length and for attaching carbon nanotubes at one of the ends. In nanostructured form, the amorphous iron phosphate produced a useful cathode material, while the carbon nanotubes formed a percolating network that significantly enhanced conductivity."

MicroRNAs regulate biological processes by binding to mRNA 3′-untranslated region (UTR) sequences to attenuate protein synthesis. Here we performed microRNA profiling and identified miRs that are up-regulated through stages of osteoblast differentiation. Among these are the miR-29, miR-let-7, and miR-26 families that target many collagens and extracellular matrix proteins. We find that miR-29b supports osteoblast differentiation through several mechanisms. miR-29b decreased and anti-miR-29b increased activity of COL1A1, COL5A3, and COL4A2 3′-UTR sequences in reporter assays, as well as endogenous gene expression. These results support a mechanism for regulating collagen protein accumulation during the mineralization stage when miR-29b reaches peak levels. We propose that this mechanism prevents fibrosis and facilitates mineral deposition. Our studies further demonstrate that miR-29b promotes osteogenesis by directly down-regulating known inhibitors of osteoblast differentiation, HDAC4, TGFβ3, ACVR2A, CTNNBIP1, and DUSP2 proteins through binding to target 3′-UTR sequences in their mRNAs. Thus, miR-29b is a key regulator of development of the osteoblast phenotype by targeting anti-osteogenic factors and modulating bone extracellular matrix proteins.

Specialized noncollagenous proteins are also synthesized for promoting mineralization of the tissue that results in the final stage of cell differentiation to osteocytes. Osteoprogenitor cells are directed to this fate by a number of developmental signals and tissue-specific transcription factors for induction of the phenotype.

In contrast to the number of osteogenic activating factors that are known, comparatively few negative regulators of bone formation have been identified.MicroRNAs (miRNAs), an abundant class of noncoding small (∼22 nucleotides) RNAs, have emerged as key regulators of diverse biological and pathological processes, including developmental timing, organogenesis, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation (11.Wu L.

Recently, we have shown that the bone morphogenetic protein 2, an inducer of osteogenesis, down-regulates a group of miRs to relieve the negative control on bone formation in nonosseous cells (20.Li Z. Hassan M.Q. Volinia S. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Croce C.M. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 13906-13911Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar).

The specific miRNAs that contribute to regulation of the osteoblast differentiation process from the committed cell to the mature osteocyte in a mineralized bone matrix remain to be identified.In this study, we performed microRNA profiling studies during stages of osteoblast differentiation. During maturation of murine calvaria-derived preosteoblasts (MC3T3 cells), we find the majority of miRs become up-regulated during the mineralization stage. Our studies focused on characterization of miR-29b, one of the most robustly expressed microRNAs throughout osteoblast differentiation. We find that miR-29b is a positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation by down-regulating inhibitory factors of osteogenic signaling pathways and controlling expression of collagen in differentiated osteoblasts.Other studies have identified members of the miR-29 family as tumor suppressors that are down-regulated in association with various cancers (21.Fabbri M.

However, functions of miR-29 in relation to normal cellular processes have not been identified.RESULTSUp-regulation of microRNAs during MC3T3 Osteoblast DifferentiationMC3T3 preosteoblastic cells derived from fetal mouse calvaria undergo maturation when cultured in osteogenic medium (Fig. 1). Robust activity of the early osteoblast marker AlkP begins in the matrix maturation period with cellular multi-layering from days 7–14 (Fig. 1A, top panel). The von Kossa silver stain (Fig. 1A, lower panel) shows the extent of mineralization throughout the cell layer from days 21 to 28. Runx2, the primary essential transcription factor for bone formation (33.Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.-H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T.

Quantitative RT-PCR results show the typical mRNA expression profile of early stage osteogenic markers Runx2 and AlkP and the mineralization stage marker osteocalcin at the five time points selected for microRNA profiling (Fig. 1C).To understand the potential involvement of miRNAs in osteoblast differentiation, we analyzed the expression of miRs using an established microarray platform (32.Liu C.G. Calin G.A. Meloon B. Gamliel N. Sevignani C. Ferracin M. Dumitru C.D. Shimizu M. Zupo S. Dono M. Alder H. Bullrich F. Negrini M. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9740-9744Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Of the significantly expressed and statistically changed miRNAs, 58 were up-regulated from days 7 to 28 with maximal expression during the mineralization stage (supplemental Fig. S1A). Ten miRs were down-regulated during osteoblast differentiation (supplemental Fig. S1B). In the up-regulated group, miR-29b was among the most significantly changed. Interestingly, miR-29b and 14 others including the family of miR-let-7 and miR-26 (Fig. 1D) were all predicted to target many mRNAs encoding extracellular matrix proteins (supplemental Table S1). We validated the expression profile of miR-29b in three osteoblast cell models. Expression of mature miR-29b increased from low levels at day 0 to maximum levels on day 28 of MC3T3 cell differentiation, with a decline at 14 days (Fig. 1, E and G, left panel). This temporal pattern of miR29b expression was confirmed in primary rat calvaria osteoblast cells (Fig. 1, F and G, right panel) with a slight decline on days 8–12 when proliferation ceased in the multilayered cell nodules (34.Owen T.A. Aronow M. Shalhoub V. Barone L.M. Wilming L. Tassinari M.S. Kennedy M.B. Pockwinse S. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). In both osteoblast models, miR-29b increased during the period of mineral deposition. We also examined the MC3T3 clone 4, which was selected for its high capacity to mineralize and find that miR-29b expression increased from day 0 to day 28 but exhibited a more continuous profile (supplemental Fig. S1C). Together these expression profiles suggest a requirement for miR-29b to support osteoblast differentiation at multiple stages.miR-29b Promotes Osteogenic DifferentiationWe addressed the functional activity of miR-29b in osteoblasts by overexpression studies (Fig. 2). miR-29b induced protein and mRNA expression of Runx2 and AlkP by 48 h (Fig. 2, A and B). We examined the long term effect of miR-29b in promoting osteoblast differentiation by transfection of miR-29b in preosteoblasts for 72 h until cells came to confluency. At this time, differentiation was induced for 4 and 7 days. Histological analysis showed that AlkP activity (Fig. 2C) and mRNA (Fig. 2D) were increased. Runx2 protein levels were also elevated by miR-29b, reflecting enhanced differentiation at both time points (Fig. 2E). Fig. 2F shows that exogenous miR-29b cellular levels were sustained throughout the 7 days of differentiation. These findings indicate that miR-29b increases osteogenic differentiation.FIGURE 2miR-29b activates osteogenic differentiation in osteoblasts. A and B, MC3T3 osteoblast cells were transfected with miR-29b mature miRNA oligonucleotides (50 nm), miRNA negative Control 1 (miR-C) (50 nm), or transfection reagent only (Mock) for 48 h for protein and RNA analysis. Both expression of Runx2 protein (A) and Runx2 and AlkP mRNA were up-regulated in miR-29b overexpressing cells (B). C–E, miR-29b promotes osteoblast differentiation. After transfection with 50 or 100 nm miR-29b or miRNA Control (miR-C) for 72 h, confluent MC3T3 cells were treated with α-minimum essential medium containing 10 mm β-glycerophosphate and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid for 4 or 7 days. The cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for histochemical detection of alkaline phosphatase (C). The mRNA level of AlkP was detected by quantitative PCR normalized by GAPDH (D). Runx2 and β-actin protein (as control) were detected by Western blot (E). F, Northern blot analysis shows endogenous (miR-C lanes) and overexpressed miR-29b levels in the samples shown in E.

The complementary pairing between the miR-29b “seed region” and the 3′-UTR is highly conserved in vertebrate species (Fig. 3A). The 3′-UTR reporter assays and HDAC4 and TGFβ3 endogenous protein levels were both repressed by miR-29b (Fig. 3B), indicating a block in protein translation (Fig. 3C, upper panel). As expected for miRNAs, no significant change in HDAC4 and TGFβ3 mRNA levels was found (Fig. 3C, lower panel). Together, these results provide evidence that both HDAC4 and TGFβ3 are direct targets of miR-29b mediated translational repression. Therefore, we examined protein levels of these factors during osteoblast differentiation. We observed that HDAC4 protein levels remained at a constitutive level from days 4 to 28 (Fig. 3D). However, TGFβ3 protein decreased after day 7 of osteoblast differentiation, consistent withmiR-29b increased levels and the potent inhibitory effects of TGFβ on osteoblast regulatory mechanisms (35.Kang J.S.

We tested the consequence of miR-29b on Wnt signaling, which is known to promote bone formation (Fig. 3F). We expressed miR-29b at two concentrations, followed by differentiation conditions as described in Fig. 2D. This study showed that 4 and 7 days after initiation of osteoblast maturation, the TCF transcriptional mediator of Wnt-β-catenin signaling is up-regulated, consistent with miR-29b down-regulation of the Wnt pathway inhibitor CTNNBIP1. We conclude from these results that miR-29b inhibits multiple negative regulators of osteoblastogenesis and thereby facilitates progression of differentiation.Collagen Genes Are Directly Targeted by miR-29bmiR-29b is predicted to target a large number of collagen genes (supplemental Table S1), which was counter-intuitive to the well established requirement for synthesis of a collagen type I ECM to promote osteoblast differentiation (31.Franceschi R.T.

This finding suggests that a cohort of microRNAs tightly regulate collagen protein accumulation in the bone ECM. Three putative binding sites for miR-29b are predicted in the Col1a1 mRNA 3′-UTR (Fig. 4A), and sites are evolutionarily conserved among vertebrate species. Our transfection assay results showed that ectopic miR-29b in osteoblasts significantly repressed the luciferase activity of reporter plasmids carrying the Col1a1 3′-UTR. Complementary to this effect, anti-miR-29b activated the luciferase activity of the reporter plasmid and antagonized the effect of miR-29b on the reporters (Fig. 4A). Col1a1 mRNA and protein were down-regulated in miR-29b overexpressing MC3T3 cells (Fig. 4B), which verifies that miR-29 directly targets Col1a1. Furthermore, the finding that Col1a1 mRNA was decreased indicates that mRNA stability was also affected by miR-29b. Luciferase assays (Fig. 4C) and decreased mRNA levels (Fig. 4D) also validated that miR-29b directly targets other collagen genes, including Col5a3, a minor component of bone tissue, and Col4a2, a basement membrane collagen.FIGURE 4miR-29b functions as an attenuator for collagen in differentiated osteoblasts. A, Col1a1 is a direct target of miR-29b. Three putative target sites of miR-29b are predicted to be in Col1a1 mRNA 3′-UTR by TargetScan, PicTar, and miRanda program (upper panel). MC3T3 cells were co-transfected with the luciferase constructs, phRL-null (Renilla plasmid) and 100 nm RNA oligonucleotides of miR-29b, miRNA negative control (miR-C), Anti-miR-29b or Anti-miR negative control (Anti-miR-C), as shown in the lower panel. Luciferase assays were performed 36 h after transfection. The ratio of reporter (firefly) to control phRL-null plasmid (Renilla) in relative luminescence units was plotted. The error bars represent the standard error for n = 3. B, miR-29b overexpression inhibits Col1a1 expression in osteoblasts. 30–50% confluent MC3T3 osteoblast cells were transfected with 50 or 100 nm miR-29b RNA oligonucleotides or miRNA negative control (miR-C). The cells were harvested for protein and RNA analysis at 48 h after transfection. Col1A1 and β-actin (as control) protein were monitored by Western blot (left panel) and Col1a1 mRNA level was detected by quantitative RT-PCR normalized by GAPDH (right panel). C, miR-29b target Col5a3 and Col4a2 directly by mRNA 3′-UTR. Three and one putative target site for miR-29b is contained in the Col5a3 and Col4a2 mRNA 3′-UTR, respectively. MC3T3 cells were co-transfected with luciferase constructs carrying Col5a3 or Col4a2 3′-UTR, phRL-null, miR-29b, or miRNA negative control (miR-C).

Why then haven't we experienced any major mobile virus outbreak so far? Wang et al. (p. 1071; published online 2 April; see the Perspective by Havlin ) believe that the answer is related to the spreading patterns possible in the current mobile phone systems. They studied the anonymized billing record of a mobile phone company, representing the calling patterns and the coordinates of the closest mobile phone tower each time a group of 6.2 million mobile phone subscribers used their phone. While a Bluetooth virus could reach all susceptible users given sufficient time, its spread, limited by human mobility, was relatively slow. In contrast, MMS viruses would have an explosive spreading pattern, but could only reach the group of individuals that know each other and carry the same phone. Thus, no major virus outbreak is likely until one operating system encompasses a larger fraction of the total smartphone market."
https://openalex.org/W2055710769,"An essential step for therapeutic and research applications of stem cells is the ability to differentiate them into specific cell types. Endodermal cell derivatives, including lung, liver, and pancreas, are of interest for regenerative medicine, but efforts to produce these cells have been met with only modest success. In a screen of 4000 compounds, two cell-permeable small molecules were indentified that direct differentiation of ESCs into the endodermal lineage. These compounds induce nearly 80% of ESCs to form definitive endoderm, a higher efficiency than that achieved by Activin A or Nodal, commonly used protein inducers of endoderm. The chemically induced endoderm expresses multiple endodermal markers, can participate in normal development when injected into developing embryos, and can form pancreatic progenitors. The application of small molecules to differentiate mouse and human ESCs into endoderm represents a step toward achieving a reproducible and efficient production of desired ESC derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2046109805,"One of a number of options available to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic CO2 on climate is the burial of emissions from power stations and other industrial sources. But how safe and how efficient is burial? The design and long-term viability of a site depend critically on how and where the CO2 is stored. Natural gas fields can serve as analogues for safe geological storage of anthropogenic CO2 over millennial timescales, and now a study using noble gas and carbon isotope tracers has characterized the processes involved in removal of the CO2 phase in nine natural gas fields from North America, China and Europe. The dominant sink is found to be dissolution in formation water, with fixation in carbonate minerals playing only a minor role. This suggests that models of long-term storage of CO2 waste in similar geological systems need to focus on the potential mobility of CO2 dissolved in water. Injecting industrial CO2 into deep geological strata could be a safe and economical means of storing it, either dissolved in solution or absorbed by carbonate minerals. Chris Ballentine and colleagues used noble gas and isotope tracers to identify what happens to CO2 in gas fields in North America, China and Europe that provide a natural model of geological storage of anthropogenic CO2 over millennia. They find that dissolution in water is the main mechanism. Injecting CO2 into deep geological strata is proposed as a safe and economically favourable means of storing CO2 captured from industrial point sources1,2,3. It is difficult, however, to assess the long-term consequences of CO2 flooding in the subsurface from decadal observations of existing disposal sites1,2. Both the site design and long-term safety modelling critically depend on how and where CO2 will be stored in the site over its lifetime2,3,4. Within a geological storage site, the injected CO2 can dissolve in solution or precipitate as carbonate minerals. Here we identify and quantify the principal mechanism of CO2 fluid phase removal in nine natural gas fields in North America, China and Europe, using noble gas and carbon isotope tracers. The natural gas fields investigated in our study are dominated by a CO2 phase and provide a natural analogue for assessing the geological storage of anthropogenic CO2 over millennial timescales1,2,5,6. We find that in seven gas fields with siliciclastic or carbonate-dominated reservoir lithologies, dissolution in formation water at a pH of 5–5.8 is the sole major sink for CO2. In two fields with siliciclastic reservoir lithologies, some CO2 loss through precipitation as carbonate minerals cannot be ruled out, but can account for a maximum of 18 per cent of the loss of emplaced CO2. In view of our findings that geological mineral fixation is a minor CO2 trapping mechanism in natural gas fields, we suggest that long-term anthropogenic CO2 storage models in similar geological systems should focus on the potential mobility of CO2 dissolved in water."

We show that repair tissue from human articular cartilage during the late stages of osteoarthritis harbors a unique progenitor cell population, termed chondrogenic progenitor cells (CPCs). These exhibit stem cell characteristics such as clonogenicity, multipotency, and migratory activity. The isolated CPCs, which exhibit a high chondrogenic potential, were shown to populate diseased tissue ex vivo. Moreover, downregulation of the osteogenic transcription factor runx-2 enhanced the expression of the chondrogenic transcription factor sox-9. This, in turn, increased the matrix synthesis potential of the CPCs without altering their migratory capacity.

Our work may be relevant in the development of novel therapeutics for the later stages of osteoarthritis. Articular cartilage is responsible for the smooth transmission of force from one bone to another, thereby allowing for painless skeletal movements. Severe cartilage injury due to age-related degeneration or excessive use rarely heals. It can result in osteoarthritis (OA), often with painful loss of joint function (Buckwalter and Mankin, 1998Buckwalter J.A. Mankin H.J.

Current therapeutic interventions serve primarily as short-term symptomatic relief, and joint replacement is ultimately required for almost all patients (Lohmander and Roos, 2007Lohmander L.S.

OA is the most common musculoskeletal disease in the elderly (Reginster, 2002Reginster J.Y. The prevalence and burden of arthritis.Rheumatology (Oxford). 2002; 41: 3-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The world's aging population is expected to make OA the fourth-leading cause of disability by the year 2020 (Woolf and Pfleger, 2003Woolf A.D. Pfleger B. Burden of major musculoskeletal conditions.Bull. World Health Organ. 2003; 81: 646-656PubMed Google Scholar). This is our motivation for the further exploration of OA treatment options, including regenerative cell biological therapy. In cartilage tissue, chondrocytes are embedded in a framework of collagens, mainly collagen type II, together with proteoglycans and glycoproteins. These act as link proteins to stabilize the collagen network (Kuettner, 1992Kuettner K.E. Biochemistry of articular cartilage in health and disease.Clin. Biochem. 1992; 25: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The maintenance of this extracellular matrix (ECM) is important for rigidity and helps the tissue resist compression and shear forces (Goldring and Goldring, 2007Goldring M.B. Goldring S.R.

It seems to be the case that mesenchymal cells are involved in the regeneration processes that accompany cartilage tissue degradation. In early stages of the disease, Pridie drilling and microfracturing to open the bone marrow underneath the cartilage defect can sometimes encourage the formation of fibrocartilaginous repair tissue (Pridie, 1955Pridie K.H.

Bishop J.C. Redman S.N. Khan I.M. Rooney P. Evans D.J. Haughton L. Bayram Z. Boyer S. Thomson B. et al.The surface of articular cartilage contains a progenitor cell population.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, no studies to date have identified a committed migratory chondrogenic progenitor cell population in repair tissue in the context of late-stage OA. With this study, our goal was to determine whether diseased adult cartilage tissue harbors cells that feature progenitor cell characteristics and that specifically exhibit migratory capabilities. We believe that such cells may be a suitable starting point for the development of regenerative therapies for the treatment of OA. We isolated a progenitor cell population from human OA tissue, evaluated relevant stem cell characteristics, and assessed their multipotent differentiation capacity especially in the context of their chondrogenic lineage. We also evaluated their migratory potential. Furthermore, with the help of RNA knockdown, we confirmed that it is the sox-9 and runt-related transcription factor 2 (runx-2) that regulate their chondrogenic differentiation. Since these cells show heterogeneity in these properties, and especially because of their chondrogenic and migratory potential, we term these cells chondrogenic progenitor cells (CPCs).

These breaks were packed with blood vessels that had vascularized into the cartilage tissue (Figure 1A). Further analysis revealed certain elongated cells adjacent to round chondrocytes in the repair tissue that had been excised from the area adjacent to the main defect (Figure S1B). Our routine electron microscope evaluations exposed elongated cells with widened rough endoplasmic reticulum at their migration front crossing the tidemark and migrating into the cartilage matrix (Figure 1B) and confirmed the existence of these cells (Figures S1C and S1D). These phenomena—breaks in the tidemark and elongated migrating cells in deep zones—were not found in healthy cartilage. To investigate whether cells are able to migrate out of cartilage tissue taken from the area adjacent to the main defect, we studied OA tissues from 262 patients (66.03% female). We placed excised repair tissue in a culture dish, and 5–10 days later we successfully observed migrating cells in 93.83% of the samples studied (Figure 1C). We did not observe the same behavior with healthy cartilage samples. Population doubling (PD) calculations underline the nature of CPCs as a progenitor cell system. We derived a result of 60 PD, and we note that after 100 days of monolayer culture our CPCs had undergone 28–30 PD, with incrementally increasing time for each doubling event (Figure 1D). Taken together with increasing levels of p16INK in the heterogeneous population, this seems to indicate cell senescence. Similar PD values have been recorded for other stem cells, including human tendon stem cells (Bi et al., 2007Bi Y. Ehirchiou D. Kilts T.M. Inkson C.A. Embree M.C. Sonoyama W. Li L. Leet A.I. Seo B.M. Zhang L. et al.Identification of tendon stem/progenitor cells and the role of the extracellular matrix in their niche.Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1219-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry showed that these cells were positive for STRO-1 and CD29 (Figure 1E), two markers that are related to stem cells. Dilution cloning generated 2%–8% clones derived from single cells of primary CPCs (Figure 1F). However, after 64.6 PD, these clones entered senescence. Therefore, we immortalized CPCs in order to generate sufficient numbers of cells from each individual clone. Our goal was to further compare the characteristics of clonal CPCs and the heterogeneous population. Before we could further assess CPCs in terms of progenitor cell criteria, we compared the gene expression profile of CPCs to that of bone cells. For comparison purposes, we chose a heterogeneous population of an osteoblastic lineage, referred to here as osteoblast lineage cells. These cells were taken from underneath the main OA defect. Chondrocytes were excised from healthy cartilage. We harvested these cells, expanded them to passage 1 (P1), and carried out real-time RT-PCRs. Chondrocytes exhibited high relative expressions of collagen type II; intermediate levels of sox-9, one of the major chondrogenic transcription factors; and low levels of collagen type I and runx-2, one of the major osteogenic transcription factors (Figure 2A). In contrast, CPCs exhibited intermediate levels of sox-9 and runx-2 as well as high levels of collagen type I (Figure 2B). The osteoblast lineage cells displayed high levels of collagen type I and runx-2 as well as the bone cell markers MEPE and sclerostin (Figure 2C). Immunocytochemistry confirmed this unique pattern. CPCs tested positive for sox-9, runx-2, and collagen type I. The same was seen for clonal CPCs, identified in Figure 2, IF8. Chondrocytes were positive for sox-9, aggrecan, and glycosaminoglycan (Alcian blue) staining and negative for runx-2. The opposite was true for the osteoblast lineage cells, which were also positive for osteocalcin staining (Figure 2D). Intracellular FACS analysis revealed that the CPC was positive for collagen type I and sox-9 but negative for collagen type II protein (Figure 2E). Osteoblast lineage cells were positive for collagen type I, β1, and α4 integrin (Figure 3A). Chondrocytes were positive for sox-9, β1, and α5 integrin (Figure 3B). CPCs tested positive for the integrins β1, α3, and α5 (Figure 3C).Figure 3Comparison of the FACS Analysis of CPCs, Chondrocytes, and Osteoblast Lineage CellsShow full caption(A) Osteoblast lineage cells are positive for collagen type I, integrin β1, and α4.

We also used flow cytometry to examine the presence of surface antigens in our CPC population. We identified populations that were nearly homogeneous in respect of the following markers related to stem cells: CD13, CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105. More than 15% were positive for STRO-1. CPCs were negative for the markers CD34, CD31, and CD117, as well as for the leukocyte marker CD45, thus demonstrating an absence of contaminating hematopoietic cells (Figures 3D and 2F). Other markers assigned to bone marrow-derived stromal cells—for example, CD271, CD18, or CD31—were negative in our CPC populations. Similar marker profiles were seen for clonal CPCs. To test for cell culture artifacts, we also stained native OA tissue and confirmed the presence of CD73/CD29 double-positive cells in vivo (Figure 2G), allowing us to rule out cell culture artifacts as an explanation of our results. To further characterize CPCs, we performed microarray analysis and compared the gene expression profiles of CPCs to chondrocytes taken from healthy donors and to osteoblast lineage cells taken from the bone underneath the main OA defect. For the surface antigens CD13, CD44, and CD73, higher expression values were found in CPCs compared with chondrocytes. CD29, CD90, and CD105 exhibited lower values (Figure 3D). CPCs revealed an mRNA pattern that was different from osteoblast lineage cells, in which the typical bone cell markers were upregulated (GEO database GSE10575). For CD13, CD44, CD73, and CD90, the results were consistent with the FACS analysis (Figure 3E). For CD29 and CD105, the FACS was positive, while we identified negative fold changes in the microarray. Because of the migratory features of CPCs observed in cell culture, we looked at matrix-degrading enzymes and found that MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-14, and ADAMTS-4 were upregulated compared to chondrocytes (Figure 3F). In contrast, the DDR-1 ECM receptors, and the integrins β1, α2, α3, and α4, were all downregulated, while the integrins α5 and α6 were upregulated (Figure 3G). This was partially corroborated at the protein level. Pathway analysis confirmed a highly regulated gene expression profile for ECM-receptor interactions and focal adhesion molecules. The multidifferentiation potential is the most important defining characteristic of stem cells. Therefore, we attempted to differentiate CPCs. After adipogenic differentiation, cells exhibited LPL and PPARγ staining as well as oil red O-positive fat vacuoles as an indication of terminal adipogenic differentiation (Figure 4A). RT-PCR confirmed the presence of low levels of sox-9 and collagen type I, alongside high levels of PPARγ and LPL. After osteogenic differentiation, cells tested positive for osteocalcin, osteopontin, and osteonectin. Furthermore, they exhibited alkaline phosphatase staining and, after prolonged cultivation, they showed Alizarin red-positive nodules, demonstrating calcification (Figure 4B). We detected low relative mRNA levels for sox-9 and collagen type II, as well as high levels for runx-2 and collagen type I. The same differentiation pattern was seen for clonal CPCs. However, we were most interested in the chondrogenic differentiation potential of CPCs. Even without any chondrogenic supplementation, we observed that cells that had been transferred to a 3D-alginate culture after 3 weeks regained a round chondrocyte-like phenotype. They exhibited collagen type II mRNA, as revealed by light and ultrastructural in situ hybridization (ISH), as well as collagen type II protein (Figure 4C). We also identified high levels of sox-9 and collagen type II mRNA and low levels of runx-2 and collagen type I. Again, clonal CPCs exhibited a similarly high chondrogenic differentiation potential. Control experiments were performed with immortalized fetal chondrocytes (T/C-28) and with isolated healthy chondrocytes, which did not differentiate and died soon after the start of the test (data not shown). After we had identified the influence of a 3D environment in encouraging CPCs toward the chondrogenic lineage, we decided to investigate the role of the chondrogenic mediators TGFβ3 and BMP-6. We cultured CPCs in 3D with and without TGFβ3/BMP-6. The amount of collagen type II protein and the extent of fiber formation, as observed using electron microscopy, were enhanced with TGFβ3/BMP-6 as compared to controls (Figure 5A). Collagen type II was increased, while collagen type I, runx-2, and MMP-13 mRNAs were reduced. Surprisingly, neither mediator had any effect on the expression of sox-9 (Figure 5B). We cultured CPCs on collagen types I, II, or IV or on fibronectin or Matrigel. CPCs exhibited multiform cell shapes that were clearly different from the uniform ellipsoid shapes of these cells on plastic alone. We concluded that ECM components, such as collagen type IV, fibronectin, or laminin-111 (a major component of the basement membrane extract in Matrigel), alter the cell shape of CPCs. We again found differences on samples cultured on or within Matrigel. CPCs embedded within Matrigel showed elongated tube-like structures (Figure 5C), underlining the importance of a 3D environment, as already discussed. The expression level of the matrix components was also influenced by the nature of the ECM, as was the expression of markers related to stem cells such as CD29 and CD73. Matrigel allowed for a similar expression level of CD73 and a higher level of CD29 compared with controls on plastic or compared with CPCs grown on fibronectin or on collagen type IV (Figure 5D). Growing CPCs on human collagen type II enhanced their chondrogenic potential. To investigate the role of ECM components, we performed an in vitro adhesion assay for ECM molecules and found that CPCs would adhere to collagen types I, II, and IV or to fibronectin (Figure 5E). The heterogeneity of the CPCs affects their differentiation potential. We found a reduced osteogenic differentiation potential for CPCs that expressed different levels of the various surface markers. Without the use of any osteogenic stimulation, we detected lower levels of runx-2 and collagen type I for CPCs that tested 99% positive for CD44, CD73, or CD105 as compared with heterogeneous CPCs (Figure 5F). CPCs that expressed CD73 or CD105 and that were grown in osteogenic media exhibited decreased levels of collagen type I, again indicating a reduced osteogenic differentiation potential (Figure 5G). In CPCs that express both sox-9 and runx-2, we confirmed that TGFβ3/BMP-6 had no effect on sox-9 but downregulated runx-2. Therefore, we tested whether the knockdown of runx-2, one of the major osteogenic transcription factors, would influence the chondrogenic potential of CPCs. We administered interfering RNA for runx-2 and collagen type I to CPC samples and cultured them either on plastic or in 3D. The knockdown of collagen type I RNA in the 3D culture resulted in the reduction as expected of collagen type I mRNA as compared with control experiments. Similar results were observed with knockdown of runx-2 (Figure 6A). However, when cultured on plastic, the effect of the runx-2 knockdown was not observed, possibly due to the influence of the 2D culture conditions. Similarly, the collagen type I level did not decrease. The simultaneous knockdown of runx-2 and collagen type I showed an efficiency that was equivalent to that of the single runx-2 knockdown (Figure 6B). When we investigated the effect of the runx-2 knockdown (Figure 6C) on CPCs in 3D culture in the context of chondrogenic markers, we recorded a 92% reduction in runx-2, and we were surprised to observe a greater than 100% increase in the expression of sox-9. This was in line with an increase in two chondrogenic markers, namely collagen type II and aggrecan, and a decrease in their degrading enzymes, MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 (Figure 6D). The clonal CPCs behaved in a similar manner in terms of runx-2, sox-9, and aggrecan expression. The reciprocal experiment, namely the knockdown of sox-9, revealed a strong downregulation of aggrecan and a significant reduction in runx-2 mRNA (Figure 6E). These results indicate a degree of crosstalk between these two regulators in CPCs. To further investigate the possible behavior of CPCs in vivo, and to evaluate their cell biological potential for a possible future regenerative OA therapy, we performed an in vitro migration assay. We also performed a similar assay for clonal CPCs (Figure 6F). We transfected CPCs with GFP and enriched a greater than 99% GFP-positive population (Figure 7A). To further test their migration capacity, GFP-positive CPCs were placed on the surface of late-stage OA tissue. CPCs not only migrated in vitro, they also populated diseased tissue ex vivo. The standard deviations indicate that certain slower- and faster-migrating CPCs do exist in the heterogeneous populations (Figure 7B). To investigate the influence of the runx-2 knockdown on the migration capacity, GFP-positive CPCs were transfected with the runx-2 siRNA. Using the ApoTome technique, an extensive analysis of ex vivo migration revealed both control CPCs and knockdown CPCs approximately 1200–1400 μm deep in the repair tissue after 2 days (Figure 7C). The same results were recorded for clonal CPCs (Figure 7D). CPCs were viable for up to 3 weeks; ki67 staining of GFP-positive CPCs deep in the OA tissue indicated their ability to proliferate (Figure 7E). The physiological repair mechanisms associated with diseased cartilage are few, and all are generally overridden by matrix destruction that results in less-functional fibrocartilaginous, collagen type I-rich scar-like tissue (Sandell, 2007Sandell L.J.

Miosge N. New aspects of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis: the role of fibroblast-like chondrocytes in late stages of the disease.Histol. Histopathol. 2005; 20: 329-337PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery of migratory CPCs that are able to grow from diseased cartilage tissue and that exhibit a high chondrogenic potential will open new possibilities for the future treatment of OA. Based on a number of different criteria, we have successfully identified and isolated a migratory progenitor cell population from late-stage human OA tissue. We show that CPCs adhere to and are influenced by ECM components and that downregulation of runx-2 enhances their chondrogenic potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CPCs migrate into diseased cartilage tissue explants. As in the case of other stem/progenitor cells, no single marker can identify these cells. However, a combination of RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and FACS analysis has been successfully used to characterize CPCs. Our results demonstrate that these cells are distinct from chondrocytes, osteoblast lineage cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. They exhibit certa"
https://openalex.org/W2012730798,"Consumption of dietary fats is amongst the most important environmental factors leading to obesity. In rodents, the consumption of fat-rich diets blunts leptin and insulin anorexigenic signaling in the hypothalamus by a mechanism dependent on the in situ activation of inflammation. Since inflammatory signal transduction can lead to the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways, we evaluated the effect of high-fat feeding on the induction of apoptosis of hypothalamic cells. Here, we show that consumption of dietary fats induce apoptosis of neurons and a reduction of synaptic inputs in the arcuate nucleus and lateral hypothalamus. This effect is dependent upon diet composition, and not on caloric intake, since pair-feeding is not sufficient to reduce the expression of apoptotic markers. The presence of an intact TLR4 receptor, protects cells from further apoptotic signals. In diet-induced inflammation of the hypothalamus, TLR4 exerts a dual function, on one side activating pro-inflammatory pathways that play a central role in the development of resistance to leptin and insulin, and on the other side restraining further damage by controlling the apoptotic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2007982994,"Ischemic cardiomyopathy is one of the main causes of death, which may be prevented by stem cell-based therapies. SDF-1alpha is the major chemokine attracting stem cells to the heart. Since SDF-1alpha is cleaved and inactivated by CD26/dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP-IV), we established a therapeutic concept--applicable to ischemic disorders in general--by combining genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of DPP-IV with G-CSF-mediated stem cell mobilization after myocardial infarction in mice. This approach leads to (1) decreased myocardial DPP-IV activity, (2) increased myocardial homing of circulating CXCR-4+ stem cells, (3) reduced cardiac remodeling, and (4) improved heart function and survival. Indeed, CD26 depletion promoted posttranslational stabilization of active SDF-1alpha in heart lysates and preserved the cardiac SDF-1-CXCR4 homing axis. Therefore, we propose pharmacological DPP-IV inhibition and G-CSF-based stem cell mobilization as a therapeutic concept for future stem cell trials after myocardial infarction."

https://openalex.org/W2116651275,"Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the etiologic agent for cervical cancer. Yet, infection with HPV is not sufficient to cause cervical cancer, because most infected women develop transient epithelial dysplasias that spontaneously regress. Progression to invasive cancer has been attributed to diverse host factors such as immune or hormonal status, as no recurrent genetic alterations have been identified in cervical cancers. Thus, the pressing question as to the biological basis of cervical cancer progression has remained unresolved, hampering the development of novel therapies and prognostic tests. Here we show that at least 20% of cervical cancers harbor somatically-acquired mutations in the LKB1 tumor suppressor. Approximately one-half of tumors with mutations harbored single nucleotide substitutions or microdeletions identifiable by exon sequencing, while the other half harbored larger monoallelic or biallelic deletions detectable by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA). Biallelic mutations were identified in most cervical cancer cell lines; HeLa, the first human cell line, harbors a homozygous 25 kb deletion that occurred in vivo. LKB1 inactivation in primary tumors was associated with accelerated disease progression. Median survival was only 13 months for patients with LKB1-deficient tumors, but >100 months for patients with LKB1-wild type tumors (P = 0.015, log rank test; hazard ratio = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.083 to 0.77). LKB1 is thus a major cervical tumor suppressor, demonstrating that acquired genetic alterations drive progression of HPV-induced dysplasias to invasive, lethal cancers. Furthermore, LKB1 status can be exploited clinically to predict disease recurrence."

We have previously shown that TGF-beta signaling between EC and mural cells participates in vessel stabilization in vitro. We therefore investigated the role of TGF-beta signaling in maintaining microvessel structure and function in the adult mouse retinal microvasculature. TGF-beta signaling was inhibited by systemic expression of soluble endoglin (sEng) and inhibition was demonstrated by reduced phospho-smad2 in the adult retina. Blockade of TGF-beta signaling led to increased vascular and neural cell apoptosis in the retina, which was associated with decreased retinal function, as measured by electroretinogram (ERG). Perfusion of the inner retinal vasculature was impaired and was accompanied by defective autoregulation and loss of capillary integrity. Fundus angiography and Evans blue permeability assay revealed a breakdown of the blood-retinal-barrier that was characterized by decreased association between the tight junction proteins zo-1 and occludin. Inhibition of TGF-beta signaling in cocultures of EC and 10T1/2 cells corroborated the in vivo findings, with impaired EC barrier function, dissociation of EC from 10T1/2 cells, and endothelial cell death, supporting the role of EC-mesenchymal interactions in TGF-beta signaling. These results implicate constitutive TGF-beta signaling in maintaining the integrity and function of the adult microvasculature and shed light on the potential role of TGF-beta signaling in vasoproliferative and vascular degenerative retinal diseases."

We show that a narrow concentration of the naturally occurring short-chain fatty acid, sodium butyrate, supports the extensive self-renewal of mouse and human ESCs, while promoting their convergence toward an intermediate stem cell state. In response to butyrate, human ESCs regress to an earlier developmental stage characterized by a gene expression profile resembling that of mouse ESCs, preventing precocious Xist expression while retaining the ability to form complex teratomas in vivo. Other histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) also support human ESC self-renewal. Our results indicate that HDACi can promote ESC self-renewal across species, and demonstrate that ESCs can toggle between alternative states in response to environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W2069526622,"CDKN1C (encoding tumor suppressor p57(KIP2)) is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor whose family members are often transcriptionally downregulated in human cancer via promoter DNA methylation. In this study, we show that CDKN1C is repressed in breast cancer cells mainly through histone modifications. In particular, we show that CDKN1C is targeted by histone methyltransferase EZH2-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and can be strongly activated by inhibition of EZH2 in synergy with histone deacetylase inhibitor. Consistent with the overexpression of EZH2 in a variety of human cancers including breast cancer, CDKN1C in these cancers is downregulated, and breast tumors expressing low levels of CDKN1C are associated with a poor prognosis. We further show that assessing both EZH2 and CDKN1C expression levels as a measurement of EZH2 pathway activity provides a more predictive power of disease outcome than that achieved with EZH2 or CDKN1C alone. Taken together, our study reveals a novel epigenetic mechanism governing CDKN1C repression in breast cancer. Importantly, as a newly identified EZH2 target with prognostic value, it has implications in patient stratification for cancer therapeutic targeting EZH2-mediated gene repression."

Identifying the structural bases of cerebellar neuronal networks in humans in vivo may provide biomarkers for diagnosis and management of cerebellar diseases. Objectives To define the anatomy of intrinsic and extrinsic cerebellar circuits using high-angular resolution diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI). Methods We acquired high-resolution structural MRI and DSI of the cerebellum in four healthy female subjects at 3T. DSI tractography based on a streamline algorithm was performed to identify the circuits connecting the cerebellar cortex with the deep cerebellar nuclei, selected brainstem nuclei, and the thalamus. Results Using in-vivo DSI in humans we were able to demonstrate the structure of the following cerebellar neuronal circuits: (1) connections of the inferior olivary nucleus with the cerebellar cortex, and with the deep cerebellar nuclei (2) connections between the cerebellar cortex and the deep cerebellar nuclei, (3) connections of the deep cerebellar nuclei conveyed in the superior (SCP), middle (MCP) and inferior (ICP) cerebellar peduncles, (4) complex intersections of fibers in the SCP, MCP and ICP, and (5) connections between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the red nucleus and the thalamus. Conclusion For the first time, we show that DSI tractography in humans in vivo is capable of revealing the structural bases of complex cerebellar networks. DSI thus appears to be a promising imaging method for characterizing anatomical disruptions that occur in cerebellar diseases, and for monitoring response to therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W1999732669,"Optineurin is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional cytoplasmic protein encoded by OPTN gene. The expression of optineurin is induced by various cytokines. Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms which regulate optineurin gene expression and the relationship between optineurin and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). We cloned and characterized human optineurin promoter. Optineurin promoter was activated upon treatment of HeLa and A549 cells with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). Mutation of a putative NF-kappaB-binding site present in the core promoter resulted in loss of basal as well as TNFalpha-induced activity. Overexpression of p65 subunit of NF-kappaB activated this promoter through NF-kappaB site. Oligonucleotides corresponding to this putative NF-kappaB-binding site showed binding to NF-kappaB. TNFalpha-induced optineurin promoter activity was inhibited by expression of inhibitor of NF-kappaB (IkappaBalpha) super-repressor. Blocking of NF-kappaB activation resulted in inhibition of TNFalpha-induced optineurin gene expression. Overexpressed optineurin partly inhibited TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation in Hela cells. Downregulation of optineurin by shRNA resulted in an increase in TNFalpha-induced as well as basal NF-kappaB activity. These results show that optineurin promoter activity and gene expression are regulated by NF-kappaB pathway in response to TNFalpha. In addition these results suggest that there is a negative feedback loop in which TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activity mediates expression of optineurin, which itself functions as a negative regulator of NF-kappaB."
https://openalex.org/W2092319343,"Information transfer is a fundamental of life. A few studies have reported that cells use photons (from an endogenous source) as information carriers. This study finds that cells can have an influence on other cells even when separated with a glass barrier, thereby disabling molecule diffusion through the cell-containing medium. As there is still very little known about the potential of photons for intercellular communication this study is designed to test for non-molecule-based triggering of two fundamental properties of life: cell division and energy uptake. The study was performed with a cellular organism, the ciliate Paramecium caudatum. Mutual exposure of cell populations occurred under conditions of darkness and separation with cuvettes (vials) allowing photon but not molecule transfer. The cell populations were separated either with glass allowing photon transmission from 340 nm to longer waves, or quartz being transmittable from 150 nm, i.e. from UV-light to longer waves. Even through glass, the cells affected cell division and energy uptake in neighboring cell populations. Depending on the cuvette material and the number of cells involved, these effects were positive or negative. Also, while paired populations with lower growth rates grew uncorrelated, growth of the better growing populations was correlated. As there were significant differences when separating the populations with glass or quartz, it is suggested that the cell populations use two (or more) frequencies for cellular information transfer, which influences at least energy uptake, cell division rate and growth correlation. Altogether the study strongly supports a cellular communication system, which is different from a molecule-receptor-based system and hints that photon-triggering is a fine tuning principle in cell chemistry."

A fourth-order spherical harmonic expansion yields north polar, south polar, and mean equatorial radii of 2574.32 +/- 0.05 kilometers (km), 2574.36 +/- 0.03 km, and 2574.91 +/- 0.11 km, respectively; its mean radius is 2574.73 +/- 0.09 km. Titan's shape approximates a hydrostatic, synchronously rotating triaxial ellipsoid but is best fit by such a body orbiting closer to Saturn than Titan presently does. Titan's lack of high relief implies that most--but not all--of the surface features observed with the Cassini imaging subsystem and synthetic aperture radar are uncorrelated with topography and elevation. Titan's depressed polar radii suggest that a constant geopotential hydrocarbon table could explain the confinement of the hydrocarbon lakes to high latitudes."
https://openalex.org/W1974145397,"Activation of the RB1 pathway triggers the cell-cycle arrest that mediates cell-cell contact inhibition. Accordingly, mutation of all three RB1 family members leads to loss of contact inhibition and outgrowth of fibroblasts into spheres where cell-cell contacts predominate. We present evidence that such outgrowth triggers reprogramming to generate cells with properties of cancer stem cells. Fibroblasts with only a single RB1 mutation remain contact inhibited; however, if this contact inhibition is bypassed by forcing the RB1(-/-) cells to form spheres in suspension, cells with properties of cancer stem cells are also generated. These cells not only form tumors in nude mice but also generate differentiated cells. We propose that contact inhibition imposed by the RB1 pathway performs an unexpected tumor suppressor function by preventing cell outgrowth into structures where cells with properties of cancer stem cells can be generated from differentiated somatic cells in advancing cancers."

R0 sub-lineages are badly defined in the control region and therefore, the analysis of diagnostic coding region polymorphisms is needed in order to gain resolution in population and medical studies.We sequenced the first hypervariable segment (HVS-I) of 518 individuals from different North Iberian regions. The mtDNAs belonging to R0 (approximately 57%) were further genotyped for a set of 71 coding region SNPs characterizing major and minor branches of R0. We found that the North Iberian Peninsula shows moderate levels of population stratification; for instance, haplogroup V reaches the highest frequency in Cantabria (north-central Iberia), but lower in Galicia (northwest Iberia) and Catalonia (northeast Iberia). When compared to other European and Middle East populations, haplogroups H1, H3 and H5a show frequency peaks in the Franco-Cantabrian region, declining from West towards the East and South Europe. In addition, we have characterized, by way of complete genome sequencing, a new autochthonous clade of haplogroup H in the Basque country, named H2a5. Its coalescence age, 15.6+/-8 thousand years ago (kya), dates to the period immediately after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).In contrast to other H lineages that experienced re-expansion outside the Franco-Cantabrian refuge after the LGM (e.g. H1 and H3), H2a5 most likely remained confined to this area till present days."
https://openalex.org/W2156243473,"The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 is overexpressed in the majority of tumors and is critically involved in the development and metastasis of these tumors. CXCR4 is expressed in malignant tumor cells whereas its ligand SDF-1 (CXCL12) is expressed mainly by cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF). Similarly to CXCR4, the chemokine CCL20 is overexpressed in variety of tumors; however its role and regulation in tumors is not fully clear. Here, we show that the chemokine receptor CXCR4 stimulates the production of the chemokine CCL20 and that CCL20 stimulates the proliferation and adhesion to collagen of various tumor cells. Furthermore, overexpression of CCL20 in tumor cells promotes growth and adhesion in vitro and increased tumor growth and invasiveness in vivo. Moreover, neutralizing antibodies to CCL20 inhibit the in vivo growth of tumors that either overexpress CXCR4 or CCL20 or naturally express CCL20.

Integrin alpha8beta1 bound specifically to nephronectin with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.28 +/- 0.01 nm, but showed only marginal affinities for fibronectin and other RGD-containing ligands. The high-affinity binding to alpha8beta1 integrin was fully reproduced with a recombinant nephronectin fragment derived from the RGD-containing central ""linker"" segment. A series of deletion mutants of the recombinant fragment identified the LFEIFEIER sequence on the C-terminal side of the RGD motif as an auxiliary site required for high-affinity binding to alpha8beta1 integrin. Alanine scanning mutagenesis within the LFEIFEIER sequence defined the EIE sequence as a critical motif ensuring the high-affinity integrin-ligand interaction. Although a synthetic LFEIFEIER peptide failed to inhibit the binding of alpha8beta1 integrin to nephronectin, a longer peptide containing both the RGD motif and the LFEIFEIER sequence was strongly inhibitory, and was approximately 2,000-fold more potent than a peptide containing only the RGD motif. Furthermore, trans-complementation assays using recombinant fragments containing either the RGD motif or LFEIFEIER sequence revealed a clear synergism in the binding to alpha8beta1 integrin. Taken together, these results indicate that the specific high-affinity binding of nephronectin to alpha8beta1 integrin is achieved by bipartite interaction of the integrin with the RGD motif and LFEIFEIER sequence, with the latter serving as a synergy site that greatly potentiates the RGD-driven integrin-ligand interaction but has only marginal activity to secure the interaction by itself."

However, translating the regenerative potential of pluripotent stem cells to treat human disease faces many challenges, including the design of mechanisms that will allow for control over the transplanted cells. With the recent FDA approval to test the use of human embryonic stem cells for spinal cord injury treatment (Couzin, 2009Couzin J. Celebration and concern over U.S. trial of embryonic stem cells.Science. 2009; 323: 568Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), translation of pluripotent stem cells to the clinic is rapidly becoming a reality. In the context of the potential risks posed by wayward pluripotent stem cells, it is the responsibility of the community of stem cell scientists and clinicians to develop strategies to control our therapies after transplantation. In this discussion, we focus on candidate strategies based on genetic modification of the pluripotent stem cells prior to transplantation. Conventional pharmaceuticals, recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies all have a finite half-life. In contrast, the inherent property of stem cell pluripotency confers independence to the therapeutic agent, and the stem cell therapist has no control over what the cells do after transplantation. Among the risks associated with pluripotent-stem-cell-derived transplants are cells that differentiate incorrectly, are inappropriately localized, produce progeny in excess numbers, or in the worst case, form tumors. What can be done if some of the stem cells differentiated to dopaminergic neurons and transplanted to the CNS to treat Parkinson's disease dedifferentiate to beating heart muscle, or if stem cells differentiated into pancreatic islet cells and transplanted to the liver lose control of insulin production or are inadvertently localized in the brain? What can we do if stem-cell-derived transplants transform into malignant cells? These issues are not theoretical, as illustrated by the recent report of a glioneuronal tumor derived from fetal neural stem cells administered to a patient with ataxia telangiectasia 4 years after the initial therapy (Amariglio et al., 2009Amariglio N. Hirshberg A. Scheithauer B.W. Cohen Y. Loewenthal R. Trakhtenbrot L. Paz N. Koren-Michowitz M. Waldman D. Leider-Trejo L. et al.Donor-derived brain tumor following neural stem cell transplantation in an ataxia telangiectasia patient.PLoS Med. 2009; 6: e1000029https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000029Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In this case, the transferred population was not derived from a cultured pluripotent population, but given that proposed therapies using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) will likely be conducted with differentiated, yet still multipotent progeny, the example is highly relevant. Based on the risks of therapeutic transplantation of wayward pluripotent stem cells and their progeny, strategies need to be adapted to alter the risk/benefit ratio markedly in favor of stem cell therapy. While positive selection of differentiated cells and/or negative selection of undifferentiated cells prior to transplantation reduce the risks (Hodges et al., 2007Hodges H. Pollock K. Stroemer P.

Cell therapy and the safety of embryonic stem cell-derived grafts.Trends Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 24-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), given the inherent nature of pluripotency, additional strategies must be incorporated into the transplant strategy to ensure that therapeutic uses of pluripotent stem cells will be safe. In the context of the risks, strategies must be developed to control and/or eliminate wayward stem cells and/or their progeny. For example, the transplanted cells could be treated with mitomycin C, an agent that permanently arrests cell division. While mitomycin C is not approved for clinical use, development of new agents with similar properties but fewer risks might be useful. If the transplanted cells are not immune compatible, and immunosuppression is used to achieve immune tolerance, a strategy to eliminate transplanted cells is to remove the immunosuppression, allowing the immune system to destroy the transplanted cell progeny. This approach would likely result in deletion of the transplant, albeit with possible collateral damage to adjacent tissues. In addition to measures applied “after the fact,” it should be possible to develop “failsafe” strategies using ex vivo genetic targeting of the therapeutic cells prior to transplantation, a prominent strategy under development. Given the decades of experience within the gene therapy field, we offer this Perspective to present relevant insights and caveats to be considered when applying genetic modification to pluripotent-stem-cell-derived therapeutics. The use of gene transfer as a means to control wayward stem cell progeny is conceptually similar to using gene therapy to treat cancer (Crystal, 1999Crystal R.G. In vivo and ex vivo gene therapy strategies to treat tumors using adenovirus gene transfer vectors.Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 43: S90-S99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Cross and Burmester, 2006Cross D. Burmester J.K. Gene therapy for cancer treatment: past, present and future.Clin. Med.

Current developments in adenovirus-based cancer gene therapy.Future Oncol. 2006; 2: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, a major difference distinguishes the two situations and offers a distinct advantage for stem cell therapy applications. That is, whereas the cancer gene therapist faces the challenge of delivering the therapeutic gene to treat a preexisting condition, the stem cell therapist has the advantage of having ex vivo access to the therapeutic cells prior to transplantation. For some strategies, the proactive therapy can be designed to prevent untoward biologic events, such as reversion of transplanted cells to a pluripotent state. Alternatively, the most direct genetic engineering strategy to control wayward stem cell progeny is to eliminate the wayward cells. Our focus will be on ESCs and iPSCs, but similar concepts can be adapted for application to other stem cell populations. For convenience, we will refer to all of the transplanted populations as “stem cell progeny.” All pluripotent cells are characterized by the ability to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers, combined with the capacity to proliferate over prolonged periods of culture while remaining undifferentiated (Evans and Kaufman, 1981Evans M.J.

ESCs are derived from the blastocyst (70 to 100 cells), late morula (10 to 30 cells), or single blastomere stage (8 cells) of the embryo within 5 to 6 days after fertilization (Thomson et al., 1998Thomson J.A.

While many human ESC lines have been established (Strulovici et al., 2007Strulovici Y. Leopold P.L. O'Connor T.P. Pergolizzi R.G. Crystal R.G. Human embryonic stem cells and gene therapy.Mol. Ther. 2007; 15: 850-866PubMed Google Scholar), the use of ESCs as therapeutics is confounded by the issue that, in the absence of histocompatibility between therapeutic cells and recipient, immunosuppression will be required to prevent the host from rejecting the transplanted cells (Fairchild et al., 2004Fairchild P.J.

To circumvent this issue, several approaches have been used to establish patient-specific pluripotent stem cells, including somatic cell nuclear transfer (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch, 2002Hochedlinger K.

Nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells after fusion with human embryonic stem cells.Science. 2005; 309: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and transdifferentiation of germ cells (Durcova-Hills et al., 2008Durcova-Hills G. Tang F. Doody G. Tooze R. Surani M.A. Reprogramming primordial germ cells into pluripotent stem cells.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e3531https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003531Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The newest strategy is to genetically reprogram differentiated cells from the potential transplant recipient using pluripotency-required transcription factors (Nishikawa et al., 2008Nishikawa S. Goldstein R.A. Nierras C.R. The promise of human induced pluripotent stem cells for research and therapy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These “induced pluripotent stem cells” (iPSCs) were initially created by reprogramming mouse fibroblasts with octamer-binding transcription factor-3/4 (Oct3/4), SRY-related high-mobility-group (HMG) box protein-2 (Sox2), c-Myc, and Kruppel-like factor-4 (Klf4) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6493) Google Scholar). Mouse iPSCs derived in this fashion have all of the characteristics of ESCs—with expression of ESC markers, similar gene-expression profiles, and the ability to form teratomas—and contribute to multiple different cell types in chimeric animals (reviewed in Yamanaka, 2008Yamanaka S. Pluripotency and nuclear programming.Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2008; 363: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). An alternative combination used to reprogram either mouse or human differentiated cells to iPSCs is the four-factor set of Oct3/4, Sox2, Lin28, and Nanog, and subsequently strategies have been successful in the absence of the oncogene c-Myc with only Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4 and even with only Oct3/4 and Sox2 (Lowry et al., 2008Lowry W.E.

Although gene-expression profiles of human iPSCs and human ESCs are closely correlated, there are some distinctions, as well as differences observed across different iPSC clones and among iPSCs and human ESC lines (Yu et al., 2007Yu J. Vodyanik M.A. Smuga-Otto K. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Frane J.L. Tian S. Nie J. Jonsdottir G.A. Ruotti V.

Because of the potential of pluripotent stem cells for unlimited-self renewal, ability to differentiate into any cell type, and potential to develop tumors, the pluripotent stem cell cannot itself be used as an in vivo therapeutic. Rather, the therapeutic usefulness of the pluripotent stem cell is as an ex vivo factory to produce progenitors of differentiated cells or the final differentiated cells per se. However, there are also risks to using the cell progeny of pluripotent stem cells (Figure 1). Of all of the risks of stem cell therapy, the most serious, and the risk that has gotten the most attention, is the risk for tumor formation (Vogel, 2005Vogel G. Cell biology. Ready or not?

The concept that transplanted stem cells may result in tumor formation is not new. One criteria that defines pluripotent stem cells is their capacity to form teratomas when transplanted into immunosuppressed mice (Martin, 1981Martin G.R.

Teratomas contain differentiated derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers and are considered benign, as they do not invade adjacent tissues or metastasize. The major risk for teratomas is their potential damage as space-occupying lesions that interfere with organ function. More serious are teratocarcinomas, malignant tumors thought to arise from an embryonal carcinoma cell, the malignant equivalent of a pluripotent stem cell with genetic abnormalities (Stevens, 1958Stevens L.C. Studies on transplantable testicular teratomas of strain 129 mice.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1958; 20: 1257-1275PubMed Google Scholar, Kleinsmith and Pierce, 1964Kleinsmith L.J. Pierce Jr., G.B.

Karyotypic changes observed in cultured pluripotent stem cells share similarities with embryonic carcinoma cells, with abnormalities in chromosomes 12, 17, and X, and thus there is a small, but finite, risk of pluripotent stem cells generating teratocarcinomas (Strulovici et al., 2007Strulovici Y.

Cancer Res. 2008; 100: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). There is also the risk of differentiated progeny of stem cells generating tumors. In this regard, by definition, the fetus is derived from the progeny of pluripotent stem cells and, despite all of the natural built-in controls, fetal-derived malignancies can develop in otherwise normal pregnancies, including neuroblastoma, melanoma, leukemia, CNS tumors, and teratomas (Tolar and Neglia, 2003Tolar J. Neglia J.P. Transplacental and other routes of cancer transmission between individuals.J. Pediatr. Hematol. Oncol. 2003; 25: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Among the best-documented examples of transplanted stem cells being the origins of malignancy in the recipient are those of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation resulting in donor-stem-cell-based leukemias (Greaves, 2006Greaves M.F. Cord blood donor cell leukemia in recipients.Leukemia. 2006; 20: 1633-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Leukemias develop more commonly when the hematopoietic stem cells are derived from umbilical cord blood than from bone marrow or blood (Greaves, 2006Greaves M.F. Cord blood donor cell leukemia in recipients.Leukemia. 2006; 20: 1633-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that more immature stem/progenitor cells carry a greater risk for generation of malignancy (Amariglio et al., 2009Amariglio N. Hirshberg A. Scheithauer B.W. Cohen Y. Loewenthal R. Trakhtenbrot L. Paz N. Koren-Michowitz M. Waldman D.

There are also numerous examples of donor-derived human bone marrow cells contributing to solid organ cancers developing after bone marrow transplantation (Barozzi et al., 2003Barozzi P. Luppi M. Facchetti F. Mecucci C. Alu M. Sarid R. Rasini V. Ravazzini L. Rossi E. Festa S. et al.Post-transplant Kaposi sarcoma originates from the seeding of donor-derived progenitors.Nat.

https://openalex.org/W1997814002,"The macrophage is the natural niche of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In order to combat oxidative and nitrosative stresses and persist in macrophages successfully, M. tuberculosis is endowed with a very efficient antioxidant complex. Amongst these antioxidant enzymes, TpX is the only one in M. tuberculosis with sequence homology to thiol peroxidase. Previous reports have demonstrated that the M. tuberculosis TpX protein functions as a peroxidase in vitro. It is the dominant antioxidant which protects M. tuberculosis against oxidative and nitrosative stresses. The level of the protein increases in oxidative stress. To determine the roles of tpx gene in M. tuberculosis survival and virulence in vivo, we constructed an M. tuberculosis strain lacking the gene. The characteristics of the mutant were examined in an in vitro stationary phase model, in response to stresses; in murine bone marrow derived macrophages and in an acute and an immune resistant model of murine tuberculosis. The tpx mutant became sensitive to H2O2 and NO compared to the wild type strain. Enzymatic analysis using bacterial extracts from the WT and the tpx mutant demonstrated that the mutant contains reduced peroxidase activity. As a result of this, the mutant failed to grow and survive in macrophages. The growth deficiency in macrophages became more pronounced after interferon-γ activation. In contrast, its growth was significantly restored in the macrophages of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2) knockout mice. Moreover, the tpx mutant was impaired in its ability to initiate an acute infection and to maintain a persistent infection. Its virulence was attenuated. Our results demonstrated that tpx is required for M. tuberculosis to deal with oxidative and nitrosative stresses, to survive in macrophages and to establish acute and persistent infections in animal tuberculosis models."
https://openalex.org/W2038436434,"The genetic basis of division of labor in social insects is a central question in evolutionary and behavioral biology. The honey bee is a model for studying evolutionary behavioral genetics because of its well characterized age-correlated division of labor. After an initial period of within-nest tasks, 2-3 week-old worker bees begin foraging outside the nest. Individuals often specialize by biasing their foraging efforts toward collecting pollen or nectar. Efforts to explain the origins of foraging specialization suggest that division of labor between nectar and pollen foraging specialists is influenced by genes with effects on reproductive physiology. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of foraging behavior also reveals candidate genes for reproductive traits. Here, we address the linkage of reproductive anatomy to behavior, using backcross QTL analysis, behavioral and anatomical phenotyping, candidate gene expression studies, and backcross confirmation of gene-to-anatomical trait associations. Our data show for the first time that the activity of two positional candidate genes for behavior, PDK1 and HR46, have direct genetic relationships to ovary size, a central reproductive trait that correlates with the nectar and pollen foraging bias of workers. These findings implicate two genes that were not known previously to influence complex social behavior. Also, they outline how selection may have acted on gene networks that affect reproductive resource allocation and behavior to facilitate the evolution of social foraging in honey bees."
https://openalex.org/W2001806301,"Proteins controlling mitochondrial dynamics are often targeted to and anchored into the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) by their carboxyl-terminal tail-anchor domain (TA). However, it is not known whether the TA modulates protein function. GDAP1 is a mitochondrial fission factor with two neighboring hydrophobic domains each flanked by basic amino acids (aa). Here we define GDAP1 as TA MOM protein. GDAP1 carries a single transmembrane domain (TMD) that is, together with the adjacent basic aa, critical for MOM targeting. The flanking N-terminal region containing the other hydrophobic domain is located in the cytoplasm. TMD sequence, length, and high hydrophobicity do not influence GDAP1 fission function if MOM targeting is maintained. The basic aa bordering the TMD in the cytoplasm, however, are required for both targeting of GDAP1 as part of the TA and GDAP1-mediated fission. Thus, this GDAP1 region contains critical overlapping motifs defining intracellular targeting by the TA concomitant with functional aspects."
https://openalex.org/W2090536090,"Background Negative elongation factor (NELF) is a four-subunit protein complex conserved from Drosophila to humans. In vitro biochemical and tissue culture-based studies have demonstrated an important role of NELF in controlling RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing in transcription. However, the physiological significance of NELF function is not clear due to the lack of any genetic systems for studying NELF. Principal Findings Here we show that disruption of the mouse B subunit of NELF (NELF-B), also known as cofactor of BRCA1 (Cobra1), causes inner cell mass (ICM) deficiency and embryonic lethality at the time of implantation. Consistent with the phenotype of the Cobra1 knockout (KO) embryos, knockdown of Cobra1 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) reduces the efficiency of colony formation and increases spontaneous differentiation. Cobra1-depleted ESCs maintain normal levels of Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2, master regulators of pluripotency in ESCs. However, knockdown of Cobra1 leads to precocious expression of developmental regulators including lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (Lef1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) indicates that Cobra1 binds to the Lef1 promoter and modulates the abundance of promoter-bound RNA polymerase. Conclusions Cobra1 is essential for early embryogenesis. Our findings also indicate that Cobra1 helps maintain the undifferentiated state of mESCs by preventing unscheduled expression of developmental genes."
https://openalex.org/W2131922759,"The HD-PTP protein has been described as a tumor suppressor candidate and based on its amino acid sequence, categorized as a classical non-transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP). To date, no HD-PTP phosphorylated substrate has been identified and controversial results concerning its catalytic activity have been recently reported.Here we report a rigorous enzymatic analysis demonstrating that the HD-PTP protein does not harbor tyrosine phosphatase or lipid phosphatase activity using the highly sensitive DiFMUP substrate and a panel of different phosphatidylinositol phosphates. We found that HD-PTP tyrosine phosphatase inactivity is caused by an evolutionary conserved amino acid divergence of a key residue located in the HD-PTP phosphatase domain since its back mutation is sufficient to restore the HD-PTP tyrosine phosphatase activity. Moreover, in agreement with a tumor suppressor activity, HD-PTP expression leads to colony growth reduction in human cancer cell lines, independently of its catalytic PTP activity status.In summary, we demonstrate that HD-PTP is a catalytically inactive protein tyrosine phosphatase. As such, we identify one residue involved in its inactivation and show that its colony growth reduction activity is independent of its PTP activity status in human cancer cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2016669409,"Vaccination with J8-DT, a leading GAS vaccine candidate, results in protective immunity in mice. Analysis of immunologic correlates of protection indicated a role of J8-specific antibodies that were induced post-immunization. In the present study, several independent experimental approaches were employed to investigate the protective immunological mechanisms involved in J8-DT-mediated immunity. These approaches included the passive transfer of mouse or rabbit immune serum/antibodies in addition to selective depletion of T-cell subsets prior to bacterial challenge. Passive transfer of J8-DT antiserum/antibodies from mice and rabbits conferred significant resistance against challenge to mice. To exclude the possibility of involvement of other host immune factors, the studies were repeated in SCID mice, which highlighted the need for an ongoing immune response for long-lived protection. Depletion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subsets confirmed that an active de novo immune response, involving CD4(+) T-helper cells, is required for continued synthesis of antibodies resulting in protection against GAS infection. Taken together these results indicate an involvement of CD4(+) T-cells in J8-DT-mediated protection possibly via an ability to maintain antibody levels. These results have considerable relevance to the development of a broad spectrum passive immunotherapy for GAS disease."
https://openalex.org/W2027118953,"Dengue virus infection causes a wide spectrum of illness, ranging from sub-clinical to severe disease. Severe dengue is associated with sequential viral infections. A strict definition of primary versus secondary dengue infections requires a combination of several tests performed at different stages of the disease, which is not practical.We developed a simple method to classify dengue infections as primary or secondary based on the levels of dengue-specific IgG. A group of 109 dengue infection patients were classified as having primary or secondary dengue infection on the basis of a strict combination of results from assays of antigen-specific IgM and IgG, isolation of virus and detection of the viral genome by PCR tests performed on multiple samples, collected from each patient over a period of 30 days. The dengue-specific IgG levels of all samples from 59 of the patients were analyzed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and one- and two-dimensional classifiers were designed. The one-dimensional classifier was estimated by bolstered resubstitution error estimation to have 75.1% sensitivity and 92.5% specificity. The two-dimensional classifier was designed by taking also into consideration the number of days after the onset of symptoms, with an estimated sensitivity and specificity of 91.64% and 92.46%. The performance of the two-dimensional classifier was validated using an independent test set of standard samples from the remaining 50 patients. The classifications of the independent set of samples determined by the two-dimensional classifiers were further validated by comparing with two other dengue classification methods: hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and an in-house anti-dengue IgG-capture ELISA method. The decisions made with the two-dimensional classifier were in 100% accordance with the HI assay and 96% with the in-house ELISA.Once acute dengue infection has been determined, a 2-D classifier based on common dengue virus IgG kits can reliably distinguish primary and secondary dengue infections. Software for calculation and validation of the 2-D classifier is made available for download."
https://openalex.org/W2158989229,"Background The Eda-A1-Edar signaling pathway is involved in the development of organs with an ectodermal origin, including teeth. In mouse, mutants are known for both the ligand, Eda-A1 (Tabby), and the receptor, Edar (Downless). The adult dentitions of these two mutants have classically been considered to be similar. However, previous studies mentioned differences in embryonic dental development between EdaTa and Edardl-J mutants. A detailed study of tooth morphology in mutants bearing losses of functions of these two genes thus appears necessary to test the pattern variability induced by the developmental modifications. Methodology/Principal Findings 3D-reconstructions of the cheek teeth have been performed at the ESRF (Grenoble, France) by X-ray synchrotron microtomography to assess dental morphology. The morphological variability observed in EdaTa and Edardl-J mutants have then been compared in detail. Despite patchy similarities, our detailed work on cheek teeth in EdaTa and Edardl-J mice show that all dental morphotypes defined in Edardl-J mice resolutely differ from those of EdaTa mice. This study reveals that losses of function of Eda and Edar have distinct impacts on the tooth size and morphology, contrary to what has previously been thought. Conclusion/Signifiance The results indicate that unknown mechanisms of the Eda pathway are implicated in tooth morphogenesis. Three hypotheses could explain our results; an unexpected role of the Xedar pathway (which is influenced by the Eda gene product but not that of Edar), a more complex connection than has been appreciated between Edar and another protein, or a ligand-independent activity for Edar. Further work is necessary to test these hypotheses and improve our understanding of the mechanisms of development."
https://openalex.org/W2103151553,"Background Fascin is an actin-bundling protein that is absent from most normal epithelia yet is upregulated in multiple forms of human carcinoma, where its expression correlates clinically with a poor prognosis. How fascin-1 transcription is activated in carcinoma cells is largely unknown, although the hypothesis of regulation by β-catenin signaling has received attention. The question is important because of the clinical significance of fascin expression in human carcinomas. Methodology/Principal Findings Through comparative genomics we made an unbiased analysis of the DNA sequence of the fascin-1 promoter region from six mammalian species. We identified two regions in which highly conserved motifs are concentrated. Luciferase promoter reporter assays for the human fascin-1 promoter were carried out in fascin-positive and -negative human breast and colon carcinoma cells, and in human dermal fibroblasts that are constitutively fascin-positive. In all fascin-positive cells, the region −219/+114 that contains multiple highly conserved motifs had strong transcriptional activity. The region −2953/−1582 appeared to contain repressor activity. By examining the effects of single or multiple point mutations of conserved motifs within the −219/+114 region on transcriptional reporter activity, we identified for the first time that the conserved CREB and AhR binding motifs are major determinants of transcriptional activity in human colon carcinoma cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitations for CREB, AhR or β-catenin from extracts from fascin-positive or -negative human colon carcinoma cells identified that CREB and AhR specifically associate with the −219/+114 region of the FSCN1 promoter in fascin-positive colon carcinoma cells. An association of β-catenin was not specific to fascin-positive cells. Conclusion Upregulation of fascin-1 in aggressive human carcinomas appears to have a multi-factorial basis. The data identify novel roles for CREB and AhR as major, specific regulators of FSCN-1 transcription in human carcinoma cells but do not support the hypothesis that β-catenin signaling has a central role."
https://openalex.org/W1971974734,"The KCNE1 gene product (minK protein) associates with the cardiac KvLQT1 potassium channel (encoded by KCNQ1) to create the cardiac slowly activating delayed rectifier, IKs. Mutations throughout both genes are linked to the hereditary cardiac arrhythmias in the Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). KCNE1 exerts its specific regulation of KCNQ1 activation via interactions between membrane-spanning segments of the two proteins. Less detailed attention has been focused on the role of the KCNE1 C-terminus in regulating channel behavior. We analyzed the effects of an LQT5 point mutation (D76N) and the truncation of the entire C-terminus (Δ70) on channel regulation, assembly and interaction. Both mutations significantly shifted voltage dependence of activation in the depolarizing direction and decreased IKs current density. They also accelerated rates of channel deactivation but notably, did not affect activation kinetics. Truncation of the C-terminus reduced the apparent affinity of KCNE1 for KCNQ1, resulting in impaired channel formation and presentation of KCNQ1/KCNE1 complexes to the surface. Complete saturation of KCNQ1 channels with KCNE1-Δ70 could be achieved by relative over-expression of the KCNE subunit. Rate-dependent facilitation of K+ conductance, a key property of IKs that enables action potential shortening at higher heart rates, was defective for both KCNE1 C-terminal mutations, and may contribute to the clinical phenotype of arrhythmias triggered by heart rate elevations during exercise in LQTS mutations. These results support several roles for KCNE1 C-terminus interaction with KCNQ1: regulation of channel assembly, open-state destabilization, and kinetics of channel deactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1998660194,"The rat is an important animal model in biomedical research, but gene targeting technology is not established for this species. Therefore, we aimed to produce transgenic knockdown rats using shRNA technology and pronuclear microinjection. To this purpose, we employed a tetracycline-inducible shRNA expression system targeting the insulin receptor (IR). Doxycycline (DOX) treatment of the resulting transgenic rats led to a dose-dependent and reversible increase in blood glucose caused by ubiquitous inhibition of IR expression and signalling. We could neither detect an interferon response nor disturbances in microRNA processing after DOX treatment excluding toxic effects of shRNA expression. Low dose DOX treatment induced a chronic state of diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, we have developed a technology which allows the specific, inducible, and reversible suppression of any gene of interest in the rat. Our first transgenic rat line generated with this method represents an inducible model for diabetes mellitus."

However, most studies have been performed in non-endemic regions and to study pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). We have studied ESAT6 and CFP10 induced cytokine and chemokines responses in PTB and extrapulmonary (EPul) TB.IFNgamma, IL10, CXCL9 and CCL2 responses were determined using an ex vivo whole blood assay system in PTB (n = 30) and EPulTB patients with limited (LNTB, n = 24) or severe (SevTB, n = 22) disease, and in healthy endemic controls (ECs). Responses to bacterial LPS were also determined.ESAT6- and CFP10-induced IFNgamma was comparable between ECs and TB patients. Both ESAT6- and CFP10-induced IFNgamma secretion was greater in LNTB than PTB. ESAT6-induced CXCL9 was greater in EPulTB as compared with PTB, with an increase in SevTB as compared with LNTB. CFP10-induced CCL2 was higher in PTB than LNTB patients. LPS-stimulated CXCL9 was greatest in SevTB and LPS-induced CCL2 was increased in PTB as compared with LNTB patients. A positive correlation between ESAT6-induced IFNgamma and CXCL9 was present in all TB patients, but IFNgamma and CCL2 was only correlated in LNTB. ESAT-induced CCL2 and CXCL9 were significantly associated in LNTB while correlation in response to LPS was only present in SevTB.ESAT6 induced IFNgamma and CXCL9 can differentiate between limited and severe TB infections."
https://openalex.org/W2065961068,"The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a pleomorphic familial disease characterized by the development of highly vascularized tumors, such as hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, pheochromocytomas, renal cell carcinomas, cysts and neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. Up to 75% of VHL patients are affected by VHL-associated pancreatic lesions; however, very few reports in the published literature have described the cellular origins and biological roles of VHL in the pancreas. Since homozygous loss of Vhl in mice resulted in embryonic lethality, this study aimed to characterize the functional significance of VHL in the pancreas by conditionally inactivating Vhl utilizing the Cre/LoxP system. Specifically, Vhl was inactivated in different pancreatic cell populations distinguished by their roles during embryonic organ development and their endocrine lineage commitment. With Cre recombinase expression directed by a glucagon promoter in α-cells or an insulin promoter in β-cells, we showed that deletion of Vhl is dispensable for normal functions of the endocrine pancreas. In addition, deficiency of VHL protein (pVHL) in terminally differentiated α-cells or β-cells is insufficient to induce pancreatic neuroendocrine tumorigenesis. Most significantly, we presented the first mouse model of VHL-associated pancreatic disease in mice lacking pVHL utilizing Pdx1-Cre transgenic mice to inactivate Vhl in pancreatic progenitor cells. The highly vascularized microcystic adenomas and hyperplastic islets that developed in Pdx1-Cre;Vhl f/f homozygous mice exhibited clinical features similar to VHL patients. Establishment of three different, cell-specific Vhl knockouts in the pancreas have allowed us to provide evidence suggesting that VHL is functionally important for postnatal ductal and exocrine pancreas, and that VHL-associated pancreatic lesions are likely to originate from progenitor cells, not mature endocrine cells. The novel model systems reported here will provide the basis for further functional and genetic studies to define molecular mechanisms involved in VHL-associated pancreatic diseases."

Here we determined the importance of glutamate binding to folding and assembly of soluble ligand-binding domains (LBDs), as well as full-length receptors, by comparing the secretion of a soluble GluR6-S1S2 protein versus the plasma membrane localization of GluR6 kainate receptors following mutagenesis of the LBD. The mutations were designed to either eliminate glutamate binding, thereby trapping the bilobate LBD in an “open” conformation, or “lock” the LBD in a closed conformation with an engineered interdomain disulfide bridge. Analysis of plasma membrane localization, medium secretion of soluble LBD proteins, and measures of folding efficiency suggested that loss of glutamate binding affinity significantly impacted subunit protein folding and assembly. In contrast, receptors with conformationally restricted LBDs also exhibited decreased PM expression and altered oligomeric receptor assembly but did not exhibit any deficits in subunit folding. Secretion of the closed LBD protein was enhanced compared with wild-type GluR6-S1S2.

We tested here whether the glutamate-dependent conformational changes critical to GluR6a KAR cell surface expression are restricted solely to the bilobate LBD, formed by the S1 and S2 segments of the receptor protein, or instead involve additional domains in the KAR subunits. Toward that end, we compared the effect of an LBD mutation that eliminated binding affinity for glutamate, T690A, on the efficiency of secretion of a soluble GluR6-S1S2 protein versus PM localization of the full-length receptor; this served as one way to test the autonomy of the LBD in quality control processes, because soluble LBDs fold properly, form binding sites similar to those in the full-length receptor, and transit the secretory pathway to be released into culture media. Furthermore, we trapped LBDs of full-length receptors and soluble GluR6-S1S2 proteins in conformations that mimic closed, glutamate-bound states by introduction of a reversible, interdomain (D1-D2) disulfide bond, allowing us to test the role of LBD relaxation or flexibility in assembly and trafficking. We found that the ligand binding mutation resulted in reduced maturation and receptor surface expression in part through misfolding of the LBD. In addition, we found that locking the LBD into a closed state reduced receptor maturation and expression but that this engaged regions outside of the LBD. Although the locked, closed mutant also had assembly defects that occurred at the transition from dimers to tetramers, these did not result from apparent folding defects, suggesting that relaxation or opening of the LBD represents a critical step during oligomerization. In summary, we propose that LBDs must be able to access multiple conformations for efficient KAR biogenesis. Molecular Biology—All cDNAs were in pcDNA3 vectors. Unedited Myc-GluR6a(Q) cDNA was received from Dr. Christophe Mulle (Université Bordeaux II, France). cDNA for the soluble GluR6-S1S2 LBD protein was received from Mark Mayer (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and the M3-S2 linker region, FLTVERMES (full-length receptor corresponding to amino acids 627–635), was inserted N-terminal to the S2 sequence. This insertion was made to allow for the study of the potential role for the M3-S2 linker in LBD function in a previous study and was maintained for consistency of data (7Vivithanaporn P. Lash L.L. Marszalec W. Swanson G.T. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 10423-10433Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Six c-Myc epitopes were added C-terminal to the histidine codon of the signal peptide. For clarity, residues in the soluble S1S2 protein are referred to by the analogous amino acid in the full-length receptor. Amino acid numbering in the full-length receptor starts with the initiation methionine (8Priel A. Selak S. Lerma J. Stern-Bach Y. Neuron. 2006; 52: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Mah S.J. Cornell E. Mitchell N.A. Fleck M.W. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All point mutations were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and were confirmed via DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells (CRL-1651; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and human embryonic kidney cells expressing T-antigen, clone 17 (HEK293-T/17) (CRL-11268) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were fed every other day and split twice per week. 24 h prior to transfection, cells were plated at 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in fresh medium. Cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant GluR6 cDNAs using Mirus Trans-IT transfection reagent (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI) at a ratio of 1 μg of cDNA/3 μl Trans-IT reagent and maintained in transfection medium until the completion of the assay. ELISA—Cells in duplicate 12-well plates were transfected with 0.6 μg/well of cDNA. 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice in ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were washed three times in DPBS. For surface staining, fixed cells were then incubated in mouse α-c-Myc antibody (1.6 μg/ml, clone 9E10; Roche Applied Sciences) in 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. For total staining, fixed cells were first permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature with 0.2% Triton X-100/DPBS and then incubated with mouse α-c-Myc antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Both groups were washed three times with DPBS and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000, NA931V; GE Healthcare) in 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were again washed three times in DPBS and then incubated in the horseradish peroxidase substrate, SIGMAFAST OPD (P9187; Sigma) for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. The optical density of 200 μl of incubation medium was detected at 490 nm using a spectrophotometer. For experiments involving DTT treatment, at 32 h post-transfection, cells for both surface and total wells were incubated for 16 h with 1 mm DTT at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All values were an average of triplicate samples from each well, and the background absorbances from untransfected well O.D. readings were subtracted from each sample. Data are presented as a percentage of surface/total absorbance ratios. Glycosidase Resistance Assay—Medium from cells transfected 24 h with Myc-GluR6-S1S2 cDNA was replaced with fresh medium and incubated for an additional 24 h. From this medium, 50 μg of Myc-GluR6-S1S2-containing medium were digested with no glycosidase, endoglycosidase H (P0702S; New England Bio1abs, Ipswich, MA), or peptide:N-glycosidase F (P0704S; New England Biolabs) in the provided reaction buffers for 1 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's protocol. These digested samples were then run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Undigested and digested bands were detected with a mouse α-c-Myc antibody (0.4 μg/ml; Roche Applied Sciences) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000; GE Healthcare). Densitometric analysis was carried out on the film using NIH ImageJ, and the data are represented as a ratio of the resistant band to the undigested band. Electrophysiology—HEK293-T/17 cells were co-transfected with 0.2 μg of wild-type or mutant Myc-GluR6a cDNA and 0.05 μg of enhanced GFP. 48 h post-transfection, transfected cells were lifted from the coverslip and recorded in whole cell voltage clamp mode. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed as previously described (17Schiffer H.H. Swanson G.T. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1141-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 10 mm glucose, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. The internal solution contained 110 mm CsCl, 30 mm CsF, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 4 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm EGTA. Borosilicate path electrodes were pulled and fire-polished to 2–4 megaohms resistance. Lifted cells were maintained in a laminar stream of extracellular solution from a triple-barreled flow pipe for fast application of 10 mm glutamate (the 10–90% rise time of glutamate-evoked currents was ∼1 ms). Western Blot Analysis—COS-7 cells were washed twice with DPBS and lysed in lysis buffer (containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.3), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture (P2714; Sigma)) for 10 min on ice. Crude homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected as total cellular protein. 10 μg of protein were boiled for 10 min in 2× Laemmli buffer (catalog number 161-0737; Bio-Rad) and 350 mm β-mercaptoethanol (catalog number 161-0710; Bio-Rad), separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred overnight to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.3, and 0.05% Tween 20 (P9416; Sigma)) for 2 h, washed twice in TBS-T, and then incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature in mouse α-c-Myc primary antibody (0.4 μg/ml; Roche Applied Sciences) diluted in blocking buffer. After washing, membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-mouse secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h (1:5000; GE Healthcare) diluted in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature in SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE)— For analysis of receptor assembly, protein from transfected wells at 18 and 24 h post-transfection was collected as described above. Then samples were subjected to BN-PAGE, as described (18Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schagger H. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of protein were loaded without boiling in 2× BN-PAGE loading buffer (final loaded solution containing 0.125% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G (B5133; Sigma), 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8)) and separated on precast non-SDS 4–15% Tris gels (161–1104; Bio-Rad) for 45 min at 100 V, 45 min at 150 V, and 200 V for 1 h at 4 °C. The anode buffer contained 250 mm Tris base, 1.92 m glycine, and the cathode buffer was identical to the anode buffer plus 0.004% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G. Proteins were transferred overnight to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed twice in TBS-T and then incubated overnight in mouse α-c-Myc primary antibody (0.2 μg/ml; Roche Applied Sciences) at 4 °C. Following another three washes, membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-mouse secondary antibody (1:4000) for 1 h at room temperature and analyzed using the same techniques as described for Western blots. Data are presented as a ratio of the optical densities for the oligomeric states of the mutant and wild-type Myc-GluR6a(Q) receptors. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—To measure the ER mobility of the GFP-GluR6a(Q), cells were plated in glass bottom (number 1.5) 35-mm dishes (P35G-1.5-14-C; Matek, Ashland, MA) and transfected with the respective GFP-tagged receptors. To disrupt the Golgi network, cells were incubated with brefeldin A for 4 h (2 μg/ml; Sigma) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until imaging. At 48 h post-transfection, the medium was switched to Hanks' balanced salt solution with 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), and cells were depleted of ATP by incubation for 60 min in 50 μm 2-deoxyglucose and 0.02% sodium azide at 37 °C in 5% CO2, as described previously (19Atlason P.T. Garside M.L. Meddows E. Whiting P. McIlhinney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25299-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Live cells expressing the GFP-tagged receptor were then subjected to photobleaching. Immediately prior to photobleaching, an image was captured of the live cell at 17.9% transmission of a 20-milliwatt helium-neon laser at 70% power with a pinhole size of 3 Airy units on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) within the Northwestern University Cell Imaging Facility. A small circular region of the same diameter was used for each cell, and the area was photobleached by 50 iterations at 100% transmission. Immediately after photobleaching, another image was collected at 17.9% transmission and every 12 s thereafter until fluorescence within the photobleached area had reached a steady state level. Analysis was performed using ImageJ software. Background was subtracted from each image in the series, and fluorescence for both the photobleached region and the whole cell was collected at each time point. Cells were not included if the whole cell fluorescence did not reach an asymptote (i.e. continuous photobleaching occurred). The following formulas, based on methodology described by Lippincott-Schwartz (20Snapp E.L. Altan N. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, New Jersey2003: 21.1.1-21.1.24Google Scholar), were used to calculate mobile fraction (Mf), fractional fluorescence (Ff), and the effective diffusion coefficient (Deff). For Mf, we used Equation 1, Mf=100×(Fprecell/Ffinalcell)×((Ffinalcell−Fpostbleacharea)/(Fprebleacharea−Fpostbleacharea),(Eq. 1) where Fprecell represents the whole cell prebleach fluorescence, Ffinal cell is the whole cell asymptote fluorescence, Fpostbleach area is the fluorescence within the photobleached area immediately after photobleaching, and Fprebleach area is the fluorescence within the photobleached area immediately prior to photobleaching. Data are expressed as a percentage of the GFP-tagged receptor that is mobile. For fractional fluorescence, we used Equation 2, Ff=100×(F(t)−Fpostbleacharea)/(Ffinalarea−Fpostbleacharea),(Eq. 2) where F(t) represents the fluorescence within the photobleached area at time t, Fpostbleach area is as described above, and Ffinal area is the photobleached area asymptote fluorescence. Data were expressed as a percentage of final photobleached area fluorescence and were fit with a single exponential curve. Half-recovery time (t½) was calculated as the time at which fluorescence reached half of the final fluorescence. For Deff, we used Equation 3, Deff=0.88×(r2/4t1/2),(Eq. 3) where r represents the radius of the photobleached area in μm, and t½ is the half-recovery time in seconds (21Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). The Deff is an estimation and assumes that 1) the area photobleached is circular and 2) movement only occurs in two dimensions. Co-immunoprecipitation— 48 h post-transfection, COS-7 cells plated in 100-mm dishes were lysed as described above, and 500 μg of protein was precleared by incubation overnight with 50 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose bead slurry (20421; Thermo Scientific) at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. The beads were spun down, and the supernatant was incubated for 6–8 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of rabbit α-calnexin (SPA-860; Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI) with mixing. 50 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose bead slurry was added, and the solution was incubated with mixing overnight at 4 °C. The beads were spun down and washed three times with lysis buffer. The beads were then boiled for 6 min in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, and 15 μl of the eluate was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 2 μg of lysate protein was loaded for each respective construct. Proteins were transferred, blocked, and immunoblotted as described above. Optical densities for both the immunoprecipitated and lysate bands were measured, and data were represented as a percentage of the wild-type immunoprecipitated/lysate ratio. Statistical Analysis—For data involving three or more groups, a one-way analysis of variance was performed with a Tukey-Kramer post hoc test for comparison among the groups. For data involving two groups, an unpaired Student's t test was performed; if the S.D. values between the two groups were statistically significant, a Welsh correction was added. For analysis of oligomerization, a two-way analysis of variance was performed with a Bonferroni post hoc test. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Elimination of Glutamate Binding Reduces GluR6a Receptor Surface Expression—Mutation of the agonist binding site results in reduced plasma membrane expression of AMPA and kainate receptors (10Mah S.J.

Neuron. 2006; 51: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we tested whether the subunit determinants responsible for this reduced surface expression reside solely within the LBD or involve other domains within kainate receptor subunits. To that end, we compared the PM expression of the full-length GluR6a receptor to the secretion of a soluble protein (GluR6-S1S2), for wild-type and ligand binding-deficient GluR6 receptors. Mutation of threonine 690 eliminates a key hydrogen bond between the side chain hydroxyl group and the δ-carbonyl oxygen in glutamate and other receptor ligands, thereby reducing PM expression (10Mah S.J. Cornell E. Mitchell N.A. Fleck M.W. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2215-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Valluru L. Xu J. Zhu Y. Yan S. Contractor A. Swanson G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6085-6093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similarly, we observed a significant reduction in the PM expression of GluR6a(T690A) (19.3 ± 6.0% of receptor protein was localized to the PM, n = 7) when compared with the wild-type GluR6a (76.6 ± 8.9%, n = 7, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A, bottom). An analogous binding mutation in the soluble LBD protein, GluR6-S1S2(T690A), also reduced the relative secretion of the protein into the medium, albeit to a lesser degree than the reduction observed with the full-length receptor (to 65.7 ± 8.1% of the wild-type GluR6-S1S2, n = 5, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B, bottom). A similar reduction in secretion occurs with a ligand binding-deficient GluR4 LBD (15Coleman S.K. Moykkynen T. Jouppila A. Koskelainen S. Rivera C. Korpi E.R. Keinanen K. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, elimination of glutamate binding produced correlated reductions in GluR6a receptor surface expression and soluble LBD secretion, suggestive of a commonality in the cellular quality control processes disrupted by the binding site mutations. An Interdomain Disulfide Bond in the LBD Reduces PM Expression of GluR6a Receptors—In order to test the importance of flexibility of the binding domain in receptor biogenesis, the LBD was “locked” in a closed conformation through cysteine mutagenesis of two amino acids, Glu441 and Asn721, which form a critical interdomain hydrogen bond in the closed, agonist-bound LBD. The proximity of the side chains and their interaction in resolved, agonist-bound LBD structures suggested that an interdomain disulfide bridge would form and restrict rotation (22Mayer M.L. Neuron. 2005; 45: 539-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A similar strategy was employed recently for GluR2 AMPA receptors (9Penn A.C. Williams S.R. Greger I.H. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 3056-3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane expression of GluR6a(E441C/N721C) receptors was significantly lower than that of wild-type GluR6a receptors (27.8 ± 3.7%, n = 14 versus 75.4 ± 3.9%, n = 13, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2A, bottom). Analogous mutations were made in the soluble S1S2 protein, but in contrast to the full-length receptor, GluR6-S1S2(E441C/N721C) protein was secreted to a greater degree into the medium than wild-type GluR6-S1S2 protein (by 151.6 ± 11.9%, n = 3) (Fig. 2B, bottom). Thus, conformational restriction of the LBD with an intradomain disulfide bridge prevents receptor plasma membrane expression but promotes secretion of soluble LBD protein. Interactions between Glutamate Binding and Disulfide Mutants—Elimination of glutamate binding and introduction of the disulfide bond in the LBD had opposing effects on secretion of the soluble GluR6a-S1S2 protein, but both mutations reduced PM localization of full-length kainate receptors. We next determined which alteration dominated the expression phenotype in LBDs with both mutations, which could reveal if glutamate binding was requir"
https://openalex.org/W2058372775,"Background Despite the dramatic decrease in airborne lead over the past three decades, there are calls for regulatory limits on this potent pediatric neurotoxin lower even than the new (2008) US Environmental Protection Agency standard. To achieve further decreases in airborne lead, what sources would need to be decreased and what costs would ensue? Our aim was to identify and, if possible, quantify the major species (compounds) of lead in recent ambient airborne particulate matter collected in El Paso, TX, USA. Methodology/Principal Findings We used synchrotron-based XAFS (x-ray absorption fine structure) to identify and quantify the major Pb species. XAFS provides molecular-level structural information about a specific element in a bulk sample. Pb-humate is the dominant form of lead in contemporary El Paso air. Pb-humate is a stable, sorbed complex produced exclusively in the humus fraction of Pb-contaminated soils; it also is the major lead species in El Paso soils. Thus such soil must be the dominant source, and its resuspension into the air, the transfer process, providing lead particles to the local air. Conclusions/Significance Current industrial and commercial activity apparently is not a major source of airborne lead in El Paso, and presumably other locales that have eliminated such traditional sources as leaded gasoline. Instead, local contaminated soil, legacy of earlier anthropogenic Pb releases, serves as a long-term reservoir that gradually leaks particulate lead to the atmosphere. Given the difficulty and expense of large-scale soil remediation or removal, fugitive soil likely constrains a lower limit for airborne lead levels in many urban settings."
https://openalex.org/W2046996819,"The CDKN2A locus encodes two important tumor suppressors, INK4a and ARF, which respond to oncogenic stresses by inducing cellular senescence. We conducted a genome-scale cDNA overexpression screen using a reporter containing INK4a regulatory sequences to identify novel transcriptional activators of this locus. This screen revealed 285 cDNAs that putatively regulate the transcriptional activation of INK4a. Of these, 56 are annotated as transcription factors, including two previously reported activators of the locus, ETS2 and JUNB. Fourteen genes were further validated for activity and specificity, including several homeodomain proteins. We found that the transcription of one of these, the homeodomain protein MEOX2 (GAX) is enhanced in primary cells during the induction of senescence, and forced expression of this protein results in the induction of premature senescence. We further demonstrate that MEOX2-induced senescence is dependent upon INK4a activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies indicate that MEOX2 directly binds the INK4a promoter. These results support a role for this homeodomain protein as a direct regulator of INK4a transcription and senescence in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1989751554,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nevertheless, transgenic mice which express the whole HCV polyprotein (HCV-Tg) do not develop HCC. Whereas chronic HCV infection causes inflammation in patients, in HCV-Tg mice, the host immune reaction against viral proteins is lacking. We aimed to test the role of HCV proteins in HCC development on the background of chronic inflammation in vivo.We crossed HCV-Tg mice that do not develop HCC with the Mdr2-knockout (Mdr2-KO) mice which develop inflammation-associated HCC, to generate Mdr2-KO/HCV-Tg mice. We studied the effect of the HCV transgene on tumor incidence, hepatocyte mitosis and apoptosis, and investigated the potential contributing factors for the generated phenotype by gene expression and protein analyses. The Mdr2-KO/HCV-Tg females from the N2 generation of this breeding (having 75% of the FVB/N genome and 25% of the C57BL/6 genome) produced significantly larger tumors in comparison with Mdr2-KO mice. In parallel, the Mdr2-KO/HCV-Tg females had an enhanced inflammatory gene expression signature. However, in the N7 generation (having 99.2% of the FVB/N genome and 0.8% of the C57BL/6 genome) there was no difference in tumor development between Mdr2-KO/HCV-Tg and Mdr2-KO animals of both sexes. The HCV transgene was similarly expressed in the livers of Mdr2-KO/HCV-Tg females of both generations, as revealed by detection of the HCV transcript and the core protein.These findings suggest that the HCV transgene accelerated inflammation-associated hepatocarcinogenesis in a host genetic background-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2080559586,"Background The genetic analysis of behavior in Drosophila melanogaster has linked genes controlling neuronal connectivity and physiology to specific neuronal circuits underlying a variety of innate behaviors. We investigated the circuitry underlying the adult startle response, using photoexcitation of neurons that produce the abnormal chemosensory jump 6 (acj6) transcription factor. This transcription factor has previously been shown to play a role in neuronal pathfinding and neurotransmitter modality, but the role of acj6 neurons in the adult startle response was largely unknown. Principal Findings We show that the activity of these neurons is necessary for a wild-type startle response and that excitation is sufficient to generate a synthetic escape response. Further, we show that this synthetic response is still sensitive to the dose of acj6 suggesting that that acj6 mutation alters neuronal activity as well as connectivity and neurotransmitter production. Results/Significance These results extend the understanding of the role of acj6 and of the adult startle response in general. They also demonstrate the usefulness of activity-dependent characterization of neuronal circuits underlying innate behaviors in Drosophila, and the utility of integrating genetic analysis into modern circuit analysis techniques."

Novel insight into cancer biology has come from advances in the stem cell field, with the concept of a cancer stem cell suggesting candidate pathways used to target small populations of tumor cells resistant to standard therapies. But the analogy can work both ways, and signaling mechanisms that modulate tumor cell phenotypes might also be applied to regenerative medicine. This insight is one of two lessons learned from a study investigating how prostaglandins (PGE2) modulate the WNT signaling pathway (Goessling et al., 2009Goessling W. North T.E. Loewer S. Lord A.M. Lee S. Stoick-Cooper C.L. Weidinger G. Puder M. Daley G.Q. Moon R.T. Zon L.I. Cell. 2009; 136: 1136-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), published recently in Cell. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a condition characterized by hundreds of benign colonic polyps, some of which eventually progress to colon cancer. FAP is caused by mutations of the APC gene, a tumor suppressor that along with Axin, GSK3β, and CK1 comprise the “destruction complex,” which limits the accumulation of stable, typically proproliferative β-catenin. In an early case report, Waddell and Loughry, 1983Waddell W.R. Loughry R.W. J. Surg. Oncol. 1983; 24: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar observed that polyps were largely eradicated in several FAP patients given sulindac, an NSAID shown in previous animal studies to inhibit chemically induced polyps. NSAIDs are known to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes and thereby limit the synthesis of PGE2. Ten years later, the efficacy of sulindac for significantly repressing colorectal adenoma in FAP was confirmed by a controlled clinical trial (Giardiello et al., 1993Giardiello F.M. Hamilton S.R. Krush A.J. Piantadosi S. Hylind L.M. Celano P. Booker S.V. Robinson C.R. Offerhaus G.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1313-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Cancer researchers have since tried to establish the mechanistic link between APC and NSAIDs by focusing on the two major signaling pathways that are implicated: WNTs and PGE2. Do they converge and, if so, how? Cellular levels of β-catenin are controlled by phosphorylation, either directly on β-catenin or indirectly on components of the destruction complex. Suppression of the destruction complex to stabilize β-catenin is well established as the “canonical” pathway downstream of WNT receptor activation. PGE2 signals instead through GPCRs (EP1-4) to modulate numerous distinct kinase pathways, including those regulated by SRC, PI3K/AKT, and PKA. Cell-culture studies suggest that PGE2-dependent pathways can also converge at the level of β-catenin through several indirect mechanisms, including association of the GPCR Gαs subunit with Axin, stimulation of the PKA/cAMP pathway, or phosphorylation of GSK3β (reviewed in Buchanan and DuBois, 2006Buchanan F.G. DuBois R.N. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 6-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whether these observations in colon cancer cell lines (already mutant for APC) are relevant to stem cell biology had not been addressed. Goessling et al. provide a comprehensive set of data to demonstrate a conserved and widely used stem cell and regeneration pathway in which WNT and PGE2 collaborate to stabilize β-catenin (Goessling et al., 2009Goessling W. North T.E. Loewer S. Lord A.M. Lee S. Stoick-Cooper C.L. Weidinger G. Puder M. Daley G.Q. Moon R.T. Zon L.I. Cell. 2009; 136: 1136-1147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The authors focused on the development of long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which arise in vertebrates within the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region and are marked by the expression of the Runx1 transcription factor. In a lead-up study, the Zon group used runx1 as a marker to screen for small molecules that enhance or suppress HSC generation (North et al., 2007North T.E. Goessling W. Walkley C.R. Lengerke C. Kopani K.R. Lord A.M. Weber G.J. Bowman T.V. Jang I.H. Grosser T. et al.Nature. 2007; 447: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). They identified PGE2 synthesis as a common pathway associated with multiple chemical hits. Specifically, stabilized derivatives (dmPGE2) enhance the number of runx1+ cells, while COX2 inhibitors (indomethacin) block the generation of this population. WNT signaling through β-catenin is an established regulator of adult bone marrow hematopoiesis (Malhotra and Kincade, 2009Malhotra S. Kincade P.W. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 27-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and the Zon and Moon groups showed recently that it stimulates tissue regeneration (Goessling et al., 2008Goessling W. North T.E. Lord A.M. Ceol C. Lee S. Weidinger G. Bourque C. Strijbosch R. Haramis A.P. Puder M. et al.Dev. Biol. 2008; 320: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Based on the colon carcinoma studies, it made sense to consider whether the two pathways intersect in vivo during HSC development. First, the investigators used a transgenic zebrafish line carrying a β-catenin-responsive reporter (TOP:dGFP) and found that canonical WNT signals in the AGM and supporting endothelium are enhanced or suppressed by addition of dmPEG2, or indomethacin, respectively. The number of Runx1+ cells in the AGM was increased following induction of Wnt8 expression, and this effect was blocked by treatment with indomethacin. Therefore, WNT signals enhance generation of HSC, and this outcome is dependent on signals from PGE2 that promote cell survival and cell proliferation. In a series of tests for epistasis combining specific pathway inhibitors with inducible transgenic lines, the effect of PGE2 on WNT activity was shown to converge at a common point: the levels of phosphostabilized β-catenin. The ability of PGE2 to modulate WNT was shown to be dependent on cAMP/PKA signals, and apparently not on PI3K signaling, which may distinguish the stem cell mechanism from at least some cancer cell models (Figure 1). Goessling et al. next show that the pathways cooperate not only during embryogenesis, because synergy is conserved during hematopoietic progenitor cell recovery in irradiated adult fish. The mechanism is also conserved across species, since WNT and PGE2 combine to promote generation of murine ESC-derived hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and to enhance survival and repopulating activity of bone marrow-derived progenitors in transplanted hosts, even when donor HSCs are exposed to pathway modulators ex vivo. Finally, WNT signaling was demonstrated to also be dependent on PGE2 activity in the context of zebrafish liver and fin regeneration. There remain some mysteries to be solved. First, β-catenin is not required for hematopoiesis. Whether this independence is also true for tissue regeneration is not known, although WNT signaling activity may be a more pertinent criterion, since even the β-catenin/γ-catenin double knockout mice retain WNT-reporter activity through an unknown compensatory mechanism (Jeannet et al., 2008Jeannet G. Scheller M. Scarpellino L. Duboux S. Gardiol N. Back J. Kuttler F. Malanchi I. Birchmeier W. Leutz A. et al.Blood. 2008; 111: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Second, sustained (chronic) stimulation of either PGE2 or WNT signaling could potentially have the opposite effect and deplete stem cell activity (Kirstetter et al., 2006Kirstetter P. Anderson K. Porse B.T. Jacobsen S.E. Nerlov C. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1048-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, Scheller et al., 2006Scheller M. Huelsken J. Rosenbauer F. Taketo M.M. Birchmeier W. Tenen D.G. Leutz A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1037-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Therefore, it might be appropriate in a clinical setting to modulate β-catenin through these pathways, but there can be too much of a “good thing.” It will be a tricky balancing act to promote regeneration without depletion of stem cell pools or promotion of oncogenesis. A second lesson provided by this study is that elegant experimental approaches in the zebrafish model system can be combined in imaginative ways to reveal mechanistic insight. The list of techniques includes the use of reporter fish to quantify in vivo signaling activities and stem cell populations, a repertoire of transgenics for manipulating signaling conditionally, and the use of chemical biology to identify new probes for blocking or enhancing pathways to establish mechanism. While each of the research tools employed here was already available, their combined use applied across multiple organ systems in the embryo and the adult demonstrates a very impressive molecular toolbox for the zebrafish model. The relative ease of applying chemical probes and inducible stimuli (in this case, heat, but many others are conceivable), combined with lineage reporters and tissue regeneration assays, confirm the advantage of testing complicated models in fish before moving on to confirm they are conserved in mammalian systems. The success of Goessling et al. in this sense bodes well for future fishing experiments and the discovery of novel modulators to impact both cancer and stem cell biology. Genetic Interaction of PGE2 and Wnt Signaling Regulates Developmental Specification of Stem Cells and RegenerationGoessling et al.CellMarch 20, 2009In BriefInteractions between developmental signaling pathways govern the formation and function of stem cells. Prostaglandin (PG) E2 regulates vertebrate hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Similarly, the Wnt signaling pathway controls HSC self-renewal and bone marrow repopulation. Here, we show that wnt reporter activity in zebrafish HSCs is responsive to PGE2 modulation, demonstrating a direct interaction in vivo. Inhibition of PGE2 synthesis blocked wnt-induced alterations in HSC formation. PGE2 modified the wnt signaling cascade at the level of β-catenin degradation through cAMP/PKA-mediated stabilizing phosphorylation events. Full-Text PDF Open Archive"
https://openalex.org/W2093239247,"Background The gene doublesex (dsx) is at the bottom of the sex determination genetic cascade and is transcribed in both sexes, but gives rise to two different proteins, DsxF and DsxM, which impose female and male sexual development respectively via the sex-specific regulation of the so-called sexual cyto-differentiation genes. The present manuscript addressed the question about the functional conservation of the tephritid Anastrepha DsxF and DsxM proteins to direct the sexual development in Drosophila (Drosophilidae). Methodology To express these proteins in Drosophila, the GAL4-UAS system was used. The effect of these proteins was monitored in the sexually dimorphic regions of the fly: the foreleg basitarsus, the 5th, 6th and 7th tergites, and the external terminalia. In addition, we analysed the effect of Anastrepha DsxF and DsxM proteins on the regulation of Drosophila yolk protein genes, which are expressed in the fat body of adult females under the control of dsx. Conclusions The Anastrepha DsxF and DsxM proteins transformed doublesex intersexual Drosophila flies into females and males respectively, though this transformation was incomplete and the extent of their influence varied in the different sexually dimorphic regions of the adult fly. The Anastrepha DsxF and DsxM proteins also behaved as activators and repressors, respectively, of the Drosophila yolk protein genes, as do the DsxF and DsxM proteins of Drosophila itself. Finally, the Anastrepha DsxF and DsxM proteins were found to counteract the functions of Drosophila DsxM and DsxF respectively, reflecting the normal behaviour of the latter proteins towards one another. Collectively, these results indicate that the Anastrepha DsxF and DsxM proteins show conserved female and male sex-determination function respectively in Drosophila, though it appears that they cannot fully substitute the latter's own Dsx proteins. This incomplete function might be partly due to a reduced capacity of the Anastrepha Dsx proteins to completely control the Drosophila sexual cyto-differentiation genes, a consequence of the accumulation of divergence between these species resulting in the formation of different co-adapted complexes between the Dsx proteins and their target genes."
https://openalex.org/W1997178748,"The functional polymorphism that explains the established association of the androgen receptor (AR) with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) remains unidentified, but Copy Number Variation (CNV) might be relevant. CNV involves changes in copy number of large segments of DNA, leading to the altered dosage of gene regulators or genes themselves. Two recent reports indicate regions of CNV in and around AR, and these have not been studied in relation to AGA. The aim of this preliminary case-control study was to determine if AR CNV is associated with AGA, with the hypothesis that CNV is the functional AR variant contributing to this condition.Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification was used to screen for CNV in five AR exons and a conserved, non-coding region upstream of AR in 85 men carefully selected as cases and controls for maximal phenotypic contrast. There was no evidence of CNV in AR in any of the cases or controls, and thus no evidence of significant association between AGA and AR CNV.The results suggest this form of genomic variation at the AR locus is unlikely to predispose to AGA."
https://openalex.org/W2110372179,"Numerous functional studies have shown that nitrergic neurotransmission plays a central role in peristalsis and sphincter relaxation throughout the gut and impaired nitrergic neurotransmission has been implicated in clinical disorders of all parts of the gut. However, the role of nitric oxide (NO) as a neurotransmitter continues to be controversial because: 1) the cellular site of production during neurotransmission is not well established; 2) NO may interacts with other inhibitory neurotransmitter candidates, making it difficult to understand its precise role.Imaging NO can help resolve many of the controversies regarding the role of NO in nitrergic neurotransmission. Imaging of NO and its cellular site of production is now possible. NO forms quantifiable fluorescent compound with diaminofluorescein (DAF) and allows imaging of NO with good specificity and sensitivity in living cells. In this report we describe visualization and regulation of NO and calcium (Ca(2+)) in the myenteric nerve varicosities during neurotransmission using multiphoton microscopy. Our results in mice gastric muscle strips provide visual proof that NO is produced de novo in the nitrergic nerve varicosities upon nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) nerve stimulation. These studies show that NO is a neurotransmitter rather than a mediator. Changes in NO production in response to various pharmacological treatments correlated well with changes in slow inhibitory junction potential of smooth muscles.Dual imaging and electrophysiologic studies provide visual proof that during nitrergic neurotransmission NO is produced in the nerve terminals. Such studies may help define whether NO production or its signaling pathway is responsible for impaired nitrergic neurotransmission in pathological states."

https://openalex.org/W2083667204,"Various methods have been used to identify activated T cells such as binding of MHC tetramers and expression of cell surface markers in addition to cytokine-based assays. In contrast to these published methods, we here describe a strategy to identify T cells that respond to any antigen and track the fate of these activated T cells. We constructed a retroviral double-reporter construct with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and a far-red fluorescent protein from Heteractis crispa (HcRed). LTR-driven EGFP expression was used to enrich and identify transduced cells, while HcRed expression is driven by the CD40Ligand (CD40L) promoter, which is inducible and enables the identification and cell fate tracing of T cells that have responded to infection/inflammation. Pax5 deficient pro-B cells that can give rise to different hematopoietic cells like T cells, were retrovirally transduced with this double-reporter cassette and were used to reconstitute the T cell pool in RAG1 deifcient mice that lack T and B cells. By using flow cytometry and histology, we identified activated T cells that had developed from Pax5 deficient pro-B cells and responded to infection with the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Microscopic examination of organ sections allowed visual identification of HcRed-expressing cells. To further characterize the immune response to a given stimuli, this strategy can be easily adapted to identify other cells of the hematopoietic system that respond to infection/inflammation. This can be achieved by using an inducible reporter, choosing the appropriate promoter, and reconstituting mice lacking cells of interest by injecting gene-modified Pax5 deficient pro-B cells."
