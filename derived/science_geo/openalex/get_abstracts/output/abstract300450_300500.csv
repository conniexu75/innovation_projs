https://openalex.org/W2010453582,"Patterns of tree abundance and dispersion in a tropical deciduous (dry) forest are summarized. The generalization that tropical trees have spaced adults did not hold. All species were either clumped or randomly dispersed, with rare species more clumped than common species. Breeding system was unrelated to species abundance or dispersion, but clumping was related to mode of seed dispersal. Juvenile densities decreased approximately exponentially away from adults. Rare species gave evidence of poor reproductive performance compared with their performance when common in nearby forests. Patterns of relative species abundance in the dry forest are compared with patterns in other forests, and are explained by a simple stochastic model based on random-walk immigration and extinction set in motion by periodic community disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2020137498,A previously undescribed magnetotactic spirillum isolated from a freshwater swamp was mass cultured in the magnetic as well as the nonmagnetic state in chemically defined culture media. Results of Mossbauer spectroscopic analysis applied to whole cells identifies magnetite as a constituent of these magnetic bacteria.

Current risk assessments, which consider technetium and neptunium as potentially capable of migrating from high-level radioactive waste repositories, may be overestimating their potential hazard to the public since the Fe(II) content of many subsurface waters may maintain these elements in less soluble oxidation states."

In addition, the alignment of the long axis of magnetic grains has been used to indicate the direction of bottom-water flow."

https://openalex.org/W2037118624,"Gas adsorption data were used to obtain the specific surface area and specific pore volume for a variety of biogenically precipitated silica semples. The results suggest that this material is finely divided and porous. This interpretation was corroborated by the use of transmission electron microscopy at magnifications up to 180,000."
