https://openalex.org/W2028563796,"The nucleotide sequence of SV40 DNA was determined, and the sequence was correlated with known genes of the virus and with the structure of viral messenger RNA's. There is a limited overlap of the coding regions for structural proteins and a complex pattern of leader sequences at the 5' end of late messenger RNA. The sequence of the early region is consistent with recent proposals that the large early polypeptide of SV40 is encoded in noncontinguous segments of DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2082918438,High- and low-density lipoproteins carrying free cholesterol labeled with 3H or 14C were administered to a patient with a bile fistula. The free cholesterol from high-density lipoproteins was more rapidly incorporated into biliary cholesterol than the free cholesterol from low-density lipoproteins. These findings show that the liver in man selectively utilizes and secretes the free cholesterol from a particular lipoprotein.

It is also effective in vivo in reducing the mortality rate of mice inoculated intranasally with vesicular stomatitis virus."

https://openalex.org/W2068799335,"Barbiturate anesthetics, but not anticonvulsants, abolish the spontaneous activity of cultured spinal cord neurons; directly increase membrane conductance, an effect which is suppressed by the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists picrotoxin and penicillin; and are more potent than anticonvulsants in augmenting GABA and depressing glutamate responses. Barbiturate anticonvulsants abolish picrotoxin-induced convulsive activity. These results indicate qualitative and quantitative differences between anesthetic and anticonvulsant barbiturates, which may explain their different clinical effects."

https://openalex.org/W2021494887,"The intraventricular injection of methionine-enkephalin (50 to 100 micrograms) or [d-Ala2]-methionine-enkephalinamide (1.5 to 12 micrograms), a synthetic enkephalin analog resistant to enzyme degradation, caused a marked dose-dependent increase in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid concentrations in the rat striatum. The [d-Ala2] analog increased the accumulation of dopa in the striatum after aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibition, indicating that it increased dopamine synthesis. At the highest doses used both enkephalins failed to modify brain serotonin metabolism. The monolateral microinjection of the [d-Ala2]] analog (3 to 6 micrograms) into the caudate nucleus increased the concentration of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the injected side, whereas bilateral injection increased the concentration of this compound in both caudate nuclei and caused catalepsy. The stimulant effect of the [d-Ala2] analog on dopamine synthesis in the striatum persisted after destruction of striatal postsynaptic dopamine receptors with kainic acid. The biochemical and behavioral effects of enkephalins were prevented by naloxone, a specific narcotic antagonist. The results indicate that enkephalins stimulate dopamine synthesis by an action on opioid receptors localized on dopaminergic nerve terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2053996061,"Single injections of 120 micrograms of methionine-enkephalin were made into various midbrain and forebrain structures in the rat. Analgesia was observed after injections into or near the ventral, caudal midbrain periaqueductal gray matter. Seizures and other pathological electroencephalogram (EEG) changes were seen with injections into or near the forebrain dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus. No animals with midbrain injection sites showed EEG changes, and none with forebrain injection sites were analgesic. These data, taken together with other lines of evidence, suggest that enkephalin-induced analgesia and enkephalin-induced seizures are mediated by opiate receptors that are located in different brain areas and that are pharmacologically different."

https://openalex.org/W1486880980,"To evaluate the hypothesis that extracellular mediators may affect collagen production by mesenchymal cells via a cyclic AMP coordinated mechanism, normal human fibroblasts were exposed to a variety of agents (prostaglandin E1, isoproterenol, cholera toxin) which independently elevated intracellular cyclic AMP during a 6-h incubation. Concomitantly, each agent caused an average 47% reduction in the percentage of total protein synthesis represented by collagen, yet little change in other major extracellular proteins. Since no active collagenase was found in these cultures, these findings suggest cyclic AMP levels may modulate the differentiated state of normal fibroblasts with respect to collagen production."
https://openalex.org/W1559605086,"A protein kinase which depends on the simultaneous presence of Ca2+ and the modulator protein for its histone phosphorylation activity has been demonstrated in rabbit skeletal muscle and partially purified. The purified enzyme was not activated by cAMP, cGMP, or incubation with trypsin. Nor was the enzyme inhibited by the protein inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In addition to histone, myosin light chains and phosphorylase kinase served as substrates for the protein kinase, and their phosphorylation also depended on the presence of Ca2+ and the modulator protein. The phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase was accompanied with a marked activation of the enzyme. The results suggest that the protein kinase has multiple functions and may be involved in the mediation of Ca2+ effects in many biological processes. It is proposed that this enzyme be designated as the modulator-dependent protein kinase. The modulator-dependent protein kinase may be identical to the myosin light chain kinase; chicken gizzard light chain kinase has been shown activatable by the modulator protein (Dabrowska, R., Sherry, J. M. F., Aramatorio, D. K., and Hartshorne, D. J. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 253-258)."

https://openalex.org/W2052396295,"Cultures of rheumatoid synovial cells that have been enzymatically dissociated and are adherent to a culture vessel are morphologically heterogeneous. When these cells are cultured on a collagenous substrate for 2 to 6 days at 37 degrees C in serum-free medium, they produce collagenase. A monospecific antibody to human collagenase has localized the enzyme extracellularly around cytoplasmic extensions of dendritic cells and intracellularly within a few macrophage-like and fibroblast-like cells."

https://openalex.org/W1605039001,The indispensability of phospholipid and ubiquinone (Q) in mitochondrial electron transfer was studied by depleting phospholipid and Q in succinate-cytochrome c reductase and then replenishing the depleted enzyme. More than 90% of phospholipid and Q was removed by repeated ammonium sulfate-cholate fractionation. The depleted succinate-cytochrome c reductase showed no enzymatic activity for succinate leads to c or QH2 leads to c and yet retained most of the succinate leads to Q activity. All enzymatic activity was restored upon the addition of Q and phospholipid. Restoration required the addition of Q prior to the addition of phospholipid. Reversing the addition sequence or addition of a mixture of phospholipid and Q resulted only in a small restoration of activities. The conditions for restoration are given in detail. Removal of phospholipid from succinate-cytochrome c reductase resulted in reduction of cytochrome c1 in the absence of exogenous electron donor. Replenishing the preparation with phospholipid brought about the reoxidation of cytochrome c1 in the absence of electron acceptor or oxygen.
https://openalex.org/W1659072774,The calcium-dependent regulatory protein (CDR) purified from bovine brain was iodinated with Na[125I]I using the lactoperoxidase-glucose oxidase system. The iodinated protein retained its ability to stimulate the Ca2+-sensitive CDR-depleted cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from bovine heart. Stimulation of the phosphodiesterase by 125I-CDR was Ca2+-dependent and the labeled protein had a Ka for activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase that was 4 times greater than unmodified CDR. 125I-CDR formed a Ca2+-dependent complex with the partially purified cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase which was detectable by autorradiography following electrophoresis of the complex on nondenaturing gels. This technique was used to detect CDR binding components in crude homogenates prepared from bovine heart and brain.

https://openalex.org/W1577839851,"Experiments were carried out to clarify the sites of action of beta-adrenergic agonists in skeletal muscle microsomes. Microsomes were fractionated into longitudinal reticulum, terminal cisternae, and isolated transverse tubules. Transverse tubules were selectively labeled and tracked with [3H]ouabain. beta-adrenergic receptor was identified by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. Assays of beta-adrenergic receptor, adenylate cyclase, and protein kinase-stimulated phosphorylation showed: 1) beta-adrenergic receptor was detected in transverse tubules with a receptor density of 0.61 pmol/mg of protein. No significant binding was detected in longitudinal reticulum or in terminal cisternae. 2) Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase was present in microsomes but was similarly confined to the transverse tubular fraction. The activity of F- stimulated cyclase in transverse tubules was 2.3 nmol/mg of protein/min. 3) No phosphorylation of microsomes by cyclic AMP and protein kinase could be detected. We conclude that the action of epinephrine on skeletal muscle is mediated through receptors and adenylate cyclase in the external membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2015820205,"Aggregation of human blood platelets induced by adenosine diphosphate or l-epinephrine was inhibited when the platelets were suspended in plasma which had been previously exposed to an insolubilized ω-aminohexylagarose derivative of prostaglandin E1. This decrease of platelet aggregation was not accompanied by a change in the concentration of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in platelets. The results demonstrate the existence of an alternative pathway independent of cyclic AMP for the inhibition of platelet aggregation by plasma."
https://openalex.org/W1581190247,"Stimulatory modulator of cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase was purified to homogeneity from heart extracts. The preparation appeared as a single protein band in the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with a minimal M,. of 34,000, which agreed with the value calculated from its amino acid composition. The modulator was an acidic protein, as indicated by an isoelectric point of about pH 4.0 and a high content of acidic amino acids. It had a Stokes radius of 62 A and a frictional ratio (f/ f,,) of 2.27, indicating that the factor is a highly elongated or asymmetric protein. The modulator exhibited multiple bands in analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with each band found to be active. It had a sedimentation coefficient of 2.7 S and a calculated M, of 69,000. The “reassociated” modulator, obtained by dialysis of the SDStreated factor, was nearly as active as and exhibited the same characteristics of the “native” modulator mentioned"
https://openalex.org/W1534211164,"The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated nuclear antigen (EBNA) was purified 85-fold from a nuclear pellet derived from an EBV-transformed B lyphoblastoid cell line by a five-step procedure consisting of preparation of extract, heating at 80 degrees C in phosphate buffer, ammonium sulfate precipitation, preparative ultracentrifugation, and affinity chromatography on double-stranded DNA-cellulose. The purified complement fixing antigen specifically blocked the anticomplement immunofluorescence assay for EBNA. Several properties indicate a close association of EBNA with chromatin, viz. 1) precipitation of antigenic activity by phosphate buffer and subsequent thermal fractionation; 2) partial sensitivity of antigenic activity to DNase (but not to RNase) and restoration of activity by addition of calf thymus DNA; and 3) specific binding of EBNA to double-stranded DNA-cellulose. Other properties of EBNA, including its unusual heat stability, are described."

https://openalex.org/W2023734515,"Plasma corticosterone concentrations in newly hatched ducklings exposed to an imprinting model are inversely related to the strength of approach behavior. Injections of corticosterone before imprinting reduces following, whereas alpha1-10-adrenocorticotropin or antiserum to corticosterone augments following behavior. The sensitive period for imprinting may be regulated by changes in the pituitary-adrenocortical axis."

https://openalex.org/W7976246,"Hemepeptides 14-21, 11-21, 11-26, l-38, 1-65, and I-80 and non-hemepeptides 66-104,67-104 (guanidinated), and l104 (apoprotein) have been purified from horse heart cytochrome c. Addition of non-hemepeptide l-104 to any of the ferrohemepeptides or addition of non-hemepeptides 66-104 or 67-104 to ferrohemepeptides l-6.5 or l-80 produces changes in the visible absorption spectrum of the ferrohemepeptides, indicating ligation of the sulfur of methionine 80 in the non-hemepeptide with the heme iron of the hemepeptide. The absorption spectra, circular dichroic spectra, formal potential, and electron transfer capability of these peptide complexes have been measured. Noncovalent peptide complexes l-38:1-104, l-65:1-104, and l-80:1-104 and the covalent complex l-65-66-104 exhibit the structural parameters and biological function characteristic of the native protein. These results suggest that the native tertiary structure can be generated from overlapping peptides. By contrast, noncovalent complexes 14-21:1-104, ll-21:1-104, ll-26:1-104, l-65:67-104, and l-80:66-104, while containing substantial secondary structure as judged by optical measurements, appear to have an exposed heme moiety in both oxidation states, resulting in a low formal potential and no biological function. Combination of ferrohemepeptide l-65, having a homoserine lactone at position 65, with peptide 66-104, but not with peptide 67-104, produces a peptide linkage between the COOH terminus of the hemepeptide and the NH, terminus of the non-hemepeptide. This comparison suggests that the peptides are precisely oriented in a noncovalent complex such that a peptide bond cannot be formed across the gap resulting from the absence of residue 66. Comparison of the properties of the noncovalent complex l-65:66-104 with the covalent complex l-65-66-104 indicates that, while both complexes in the ferro form have a native tertiary structure,"

https://openalex.org/W1505991884,"Abstract The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase associated with vesicular stomatitis virus has been found to be markedly inhibited at high concentrations of virus. This endogenous inhibitor of the virion transcriptase was completely reversed by the action of two negatively charged polyamino acids: poly(L-glutamic acid) and pepsin (EC 3.4.23.1). Two other polyanions, heparin and polyethylene sulfonate, strongly inhibited the activity of the virion transcriptase even at low virus concentrations. Poly (L-glutamic acid) rapidly released the block in transcription of concentrated vesicular stomatitis virus, possibly owing to competition for binding sites of the inhibitor on the virion nucleocapsid transcription complex."
https://openalex.org/W2075817958,"Chemoaccumulation of Euglena gracilis toward oxygen was selectively inhibited, without concomitant effects on cell motility, by cyanide (10-6 to 10-4 molar) and carbon monoxide (5 × 10-5 to 5 × 10-4 molar). Above these concentrations, motility of the cell was impaired and the chemosensory response was inhibited. Azide did not affect chemoaccumulation even at 5 × 10-3 molar. It is concluded that cytochrome a3 serves as the chemoreceptor molecule for oxygen-mediated behavioral responses in Euglena."

The resulting molecules were chemotactic and retained their antigen-binding activity. When antibodies coupled to fMet-Leu-Phe were incubated with antigen, the resulting immune complexes were also chemotactic. Chemotactic antibody may provide a potent means of enhancing the migration of inflammatory cells to specific sites."
