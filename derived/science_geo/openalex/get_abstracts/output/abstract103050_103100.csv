https://openalex.org/W2069910776,"We show that female sterile mutations of aurora (aur) are allelic to mutations in the lethal complementation group ck10. This lies in a cytogenetic interval, 87A7-A9, that contains eight transcription units. A 250 bp region upstream of both aur and a divergent transcription unit corresponds to the site of a specific chromatin structure (scs') previously proposed to be a barrier to insulate enhancers of the major hsp70 gene at 87A7. Syncytial embryos derived from aur mothers display closely paired centrosomes at inappropriate mitotic stages and develop interconnected spindles in which the poles are shared. Amorphic alleles result in pupal lethality and in mitotic arrest in which condensed chromosomes are arranged on circular monopolar spindles. The size of the single centrosomal body in these circular figures suggests that loss of function of the serine-threonine protein kinase encoded by aur leads to a failure of the centrosomes to separate and form a bipolar spindle."
https://openalex.org/W2126122106,"Using an expression cloning strategy that relies on a functional assay, we have cloned a novel Xenopus homeobox-containing gene, Siamois. Embryos injected in a ventral-vegetal blastomere with as little as 5 pg of Siamois mRNA develop a complete secondary axis, but the progeny of the injected cells do not participate in the secondary axis formation. In normal development, Siamois mRNA is first detected shortly after the midblastula transition, which is earlier than mRNAs for goosecoid or Xbrachyury, and is present most abundantly in the dorsal endoderm of early gastrulae. The activation of this gene can be obtained cell autonomously in dispersed embryo cells. These results indicate that Siamois may play an important role in the formation of the Nieuwkoop center."
https://openalex.org/W2038682684,"Irradiation of mammalian cells with short wavelength ultraviolet light (UVC) evokes a cascade of phosphorylation events leading to altered gene expression. Both the classic mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and the distantly related c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) contribute to the response via phosphorylation of transcription factors including AP-1. These kinases are themselves regulated via reversible phosphorylation, and several recently identified specific MAP kinase phosphatases (MKP) have been implicated in down-regulating MAP kinase-dependent gene expression in response to mitogens. Here, we provide evidence that MKP-1 plays a role in regulating transcriptional activation in response to UVC as well as another genotoxic agent, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). We further demonstrate that JNK is a likely target for MKP-1. JNK is shown to be activated by UVC and MMS treatment, while MAP kinase activation occurs only with UVC. Like JNK activation, MKP-1 mRNA is induced by both treatments, and elevated MKP-1 expression coincides with a decline in JNK activity. Constitutive expression of MKP-1 in vivo inhibits JNK activity and reduces UVC- and MMS-induced activation of AP-1-dependent reporter genes.

The pathway(s) mediating the response to UVC damage overlap with those mediating the response to proliferative stimuli, and at least two different phosphorylation cascades appear to be involved. The first involves activation of membrane-associated tyrosine kinases followed by the sequential activation of Ras and Raf (1Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M.

Raf phosphorylates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK), which in turn activates MAP kinase (5Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J.

MAP kinases, also called extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) are members of a ubiquitous family of serine/threonine kinases that are responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of various transcription factors, including c-Myc, ATF2, and p62TCF (7Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second pathway relies on the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) for gene activation following UVC treatment (8Hibi M.

JNKs can be activated by a variety of stresses and hence are also referred to as stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) (11Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylating c-Jun protein, JNKs have also recently been shown to phosphorylate ATF2 (12Abdel-Hafiz H.A.M. Heasley L.E. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Kroll D.J. Johnson G.L. Hoeffler J.P.

The events leading to JNK activation are less defined than those involved in MAP kinase activation. However, recent reports indicate that JNK is phosphorylated by the MEK homologue, SEK1/MKK4 (14Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

The activity of both the classic MAP kinases as well as JNKs is regulated via reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues. They are distinguished by the tripeptide phosphorylation motif required for their activation: Thr-Glu-Tyr for MAP kinases and Thr-Pro-Tyr for JNK (6Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem.

These include the ubiquitously expressed mouse MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), its human homologue CL100, and the lymphocyte-specific PAC-1 protein (20Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

MKP-1 and PAC-1 have been shown to dephosphorylate phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues of MAP kinase resulting in its inactivation. MKP-1 exhibits high selectivity for dephosphorylation of MAP kinase from a spectrum of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides including JNK (21Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D.

Overexpression of PAC-1 as well as MKP-1 inhibits MAP kinase-regulated reporter gene expression in response to mitogenic stimulation (21Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D.

Nature. 1994; 367: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that overexpression of MKP-1 likewise inhibits Ras-induced DNA synthesis in quiescent cells further establishing its role during mitogenesis (21Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In this study we address the role of MKP-1 in regulating gene activation in response to genotoxic stress using two different treatments, UVC and MMS. Our findings provide evidence that MKP-1 serves as an important regulator of gene activation in response to genotoxic stress, and indicate that JNK can be a target for MKP-1. A rat cDNA homologous to the mouse MKP-1 gene (rMKP-1) was isolated from a λgt11 rat lung cDNA library (data not shown). Plasmids expressing sense and antisense rMKP-1 were constructed by inserting the cDNA fragment of rMKP-1 in opposing directions into the EcoRI site of pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The GST-c-Jun(1-135) plasmid was provided by J. Woodgett (11Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged JNK1, and jun-LUC (containing c- jun promoter sequences from −70 to +170 linked to a luciferase reporter) plasmids were provided by M. Karin (9Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). The coll-CAT construct, encompassing the human collagenase promoter region from −517 to +63 linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, was provided by P. Herrlich (26Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.-K. Cato A.C.B. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For UVC treatment, the medium was removed, and the dishes washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were irradiated using a germicidal lamp at a dose rate of 1.3 J/m2/s at 254 nm, after which the original culture medium was added back to the dishes. 12- O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and MMS were added directly to cells from concentrated stocks. For mRNA analysis, HeLa cells were harvested at various times after treatment. Total RNA was extracted using Stat 60 (Tel-test B, Friendswood, TX). Northern blot analysis was performed with the r MKP-1 cDNA probe using standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed utilizing monoclonal antibodies against ERK1 and ERK2 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Immune complexes were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Corp.). JNK1 was immunoprecipitated and kinase activity was measured using an immunocomplex kinase assay employing GST-c-Jun as substrate as described (11Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (60-80% confluent) were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and broken in lysis buffer (28Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). One mg of soluble protein was collected and incubated with protein A-Sepharose and antiserum against p46JNK1 (2.5 μg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA). After incubation for 3 h at 4°C, immunoprecipitates were washed extensively and assayed for kinase activity at 30°C for 20 min using 6 μg of GST-c-Jun(1-135). Proteins in the reaction were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel) and subjected to autoradiography. The incorporated 32P was quantitated by scintillation counting. For experiments examining the effect of MKP-1 expression on JNK activity in vivo, the HA-JNK and MKP-1 expression plasmids were transiently transfected into HeLa cells at a ratio of 1:0, 1:4, or 1:10 using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total DNA was kept constant using pSG5 as carrier DNA. Forty-eight h following transfection, cells were treated with either UVC or MMS and harvested after 60 min (for UVC) or 90 min (for MMS). HA-JNK was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA tag antiserum (5 μg) (Babco, Berkeley, CA). and assayed for kinase activity. MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated using anti-p42ERK2 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and its activity assayed essentially as described above except that myelin basic protein (Sigma) was used as a substrate. HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of either coll-CAT or jun-LUC along with 10 μg of either pSG5, or constructs expressing sense (pSG5-rMKP-1) or antisense (pSG5-rMKP-1as) rMKP-1 using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Twenty h later they were treated with either TPA (60 ng/ml), UVC (40 J/m2), or MMS (100 μg/ml). TPA was left in the medium overnight. MMS was removed after 4 h and the cells given fresh medium. UVC-treated cells were also given fresh medium after irradiation. The following day cell extracts were prepared from the various treatment groups and assayed for CAT (29Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar) or luciferase activity using a luciferase assay system kit (Promega, Madison, WI) The kinetics of MAP kinase activation were examined in UVC-irradiated (40 J/m2) or MMS-treated (100 μg/ml) HeLa cells by two different methods (Fig. 1). In the first, phosphorylated forms of the ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinase isoforms were identified by Western blot analysis based on their slower electrophoretic mobility compared to nonphosphorylated forms (2Radler-Pohl A. Sachsenmaier C. Gebel S. Auer H.-P. Bruder J.T. Rapp U. Angel P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 5Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Both ERK1 and ERK2 were rapidly phosphorylated (within 15 min) in response to UVC irradiation, followed by dephosphorylation by 60 min post-treatment. In contrast, no phosphorylated forms of either kinase were evident in MMS-treated cells. Similar results were seen when ERK2 activity was assessed by phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (Fig. 1 B). While UVC resulted in a >30-fold increase in ERK2 kinase activity, MMS showed only a 4-fold increase in phosphorylation of the substrate. JNK1 has been shown to phosphorylate c-Jun and activate AP-1 in response to UVC irradiation (1Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 8Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). Since, like UVC, MMS treatment results in enhanced AP-1 activity (30Holbrook N.J. Luethy J.D. Park J.S. Fargnoli J. Davies K.J.A. Oxidative Damage and Repair: Clinical, Biological and Medical Aspects. Pergamon Press, New York1992: 202-206Google Scholar), we sought to examine whether JNK1 might be involved in mediating this response. Accordingly, we examined the relative JNK1 activity in extracts of UVC and MMS treated cells using an immunocomplex kinase assay (Fig. 2). JNK1 was rapidly activated in response to UVC treatment with maximum activity observed within 30 min post-treatment. JNK1 activity was also markedly increased following MMS treatment, although the kinetics of induction were slower (maximum activity was seen at 90 min) and the magnitude of activation was less than that seen with UVC. In other experiments we have observed that JNK2 is similarly activated in response to both UVC and MMS treatment (data not shown). MKP-1 is highly induced by mitogen stimulation as well as a variety of stresses (22Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 31Charles C.H.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It can dephosphorylate the classic MAP kinases and has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression during mitogenesis (20Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 21Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To explore its role in regulating gene expression in response to genotoxic stress, we examined the expression of MKP-1 following treatment of cells with either UVC or MMS. As shown in Fig. 3, MKP-1 mRNA was induced more than 10-fold by both treatments. Maximum MKP-1 mRNA expression coincided with a decline in MAP kinase (for UVC treatment; Fig. 1) and JNK activity (for both UVC and MMS treatment; Fig. 2), consistent with it playing a role in the inactivation of either or both of these kinases. Importantly, however, given that MMS treatment does not result in significant MAP kinase activation, this kinase is unlikely to be the target for MKP-1 in response to this treatment. To test whether JNK can serve as a substrate for MKP-1 in vivo, we used a transient cotransfection assay to deliver plasmids expressing HA-tagged JNK1 along with either the plasmid expressing rMKP-1 (pSG5-rMKP-1) or an empty pSG5 vector. Transfected cells were either left untreated or were treated with UVC or MMS. HA-JNK1 protein was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using anti-HA antiserum and the immunocomplex was assayed for its ability to phosphorylate the GST-c-Jun(1-135) substrate (Fig. 4). HA-JNK1 activity was markedly elevated in the transfected cells following UVC and MMS treatment (58- and 30-fold, respectively). Cotransfection of HA-JNK1 with pSG5-rMKP-1 at a ratio of 1:4 resulted in a significant inhibition (>4-fold decline) of JNK activity following both UVC and MMS treatment. The inhibitory effect was dose-dependent with respect to the amount of pSG5-rMKP-1 DNA transfected, and was absent with a construct expressing antisense rMKP-1 (data not shown). While we did not examine the ability of rMKP-1 to deactivate JNK1 in vitro, recent findings by Sun et al. (21Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), provided such evidence, although they found in their system that the phosphatase displayed 30-fold greater activity for dephosphorylation of MAP kinase relative to JNK. Such a difference in selectivity does not, however, preclude a role for MKP-1 in the regulation of JNK activity, particularly in instances where MKP-1 expression is high and MAP kinase is not involved. AP-1 transcription factor activity is regulated by pathways that include JNK and MAP kinase (7Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hibi M.

To examine the effect of constitutive rMKP-1 expression on AP-1-mediated gene induction, we employed two different reporter constructs, coll-CAT and jun-LUC. Both of these constructs have been shown to rely on an AP-1 site for enhanced expression following UVC treatment (1Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with either construct along with plasmids expressing rMKP-1 in the sense or antisense orientation. Transfected cells were subsequently treated with TPA, UVC, or MMS and on the following day monitored for CAT or luciferase expression. In the absence of either MKP-1 expression plasmid, coll-CAT activity was enhanced >100-, 6-, and 6-fold by TPA, UVC, and MMS treatments, respectively. jun-LUC expression was enhanced 25-, 20-, and >50-fold by the same treatments. rMKP-1 had little effect on the basal levels of either coll-CAT or jun-LUC, but markedly inhibited induction of both in response to all three treatments. In contrast, the plasmid expressing antisense rMKP-1 had no effect (Fig. 5). Importantly, rMKP-1 does not act nonspecifically to inhibit all promoter activation, as similar studies performed by cotransfecting rMKP-1 with the heat shock protein 70 promoter linked to the CAT reporter showed no inhibition of heat shock-induced HSP70 promoter activation (data not shown). There is good evidence to support a role for MKP-1 in regulating MAP kinase-dependent gene activation in response to proliferative stimuli (20Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 21Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 32Noguchi T. Metz R. Chen L. Mattei M.G. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Despite its high level of induction following treatment of cells with DNA damaging agents, a function for the phosphatase during the cellular response to genotoxic stress has not been established. Here we have provided evidence for the involvement of MKP-1 in the regulation of the gene activation in response to two different genotoxic treatments, UVC and MMS. In the case of UVC irradiation, both MAP kinase and JNK1 are activated and both could be subject to deactivation by the phosphatase. However, given the relative selectivity of MKP-1 for MAP kinase compared to JNK (21Sun H. Tonks N.K. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1994; 266: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that MKP-1 has greater influence on MAP kinase-mediated gene activation than that mediated via JNK in response to UVC irradiation. With MMS treatment, however, MAP kinase shows little activation. This argues that MAP kinase is unlikely to be the target for the MMS-induced MKP-1 protein. However, induction of MKP-1 expression following UVC and MMS treatment in HeLa cells was found to coincide with deactivation of JNK1, suggesting that JNK activity could be regulated by MKP-1 in this system. Indeed, we have shown that MKP-1 can inhibit activation of JNK1 in response to both UVC and MMS treatments in vivo, and have demonstrated that both UVC and MMS-induced activation of two different AP-1-dependent promoters is markedly inhibited by constitutive expression of rMKP-1. Finally, in other recent studies in our laboratory we have found that cycloheximide treatment of cells during the UVC response (which prevents MKP-1 protein accumulation) does not prolong MAP kinase activation, but does extend and potentiate UVC-induced increases in JNK1 activity. 2Y. Liu, M. Gorospe, and N. J. Holbrook, unpublished findings. Taken together, these findings strongly support a role for MKP-1 in regulating gene expression during genotoxic stress and suggest that JNK is a target for the phosphatase. We thank J.

https://openalex.org/W2062358366,"In the plant pathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis, sexual and pathogenic development are controlled by the multiallelic b mating-type locus. The b locus encodes a pair of unrelated homeodomain proteins termed bE and bW, with allelic differences clustering in the N-terminal domains of both polypeptides. Only combinations of bE and bW of different allelic origin are active. We have investigated the underlying molecular mechanism for this intracellular self/nonself recognition phenomenon. By using the two-hybrid system, we were able to show that bE and bW dimerize only if they are derived from different alleles. Dimerization involves the N-terminal variable domains. Different point mutants of bE2 were isolated that function in combination with bW2. The majority of such bE2 mutant polypeptides were also able to form heterodimers with bW2 in the two-hybrid system. Nonself-dependent dimerization of bE and bW was supported with a biochemical interaction assay with immobilized proteins. Our results suggest a model for self/nonself recognition in which variable cohesive contacts direct dimerization."

Almost all are classified as Archaea (formerly Archaebacteria, Ref. 3Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This organism utilizes both complex (starch, glycogen) and simple (maltose, cellobiose) sugars as a carbon source but monosaccharides (glucose, fructose) do not support growth.

Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas FOR utilizes only C1-C3 aldehydes. FOR is thought to function in peptide catabolism (11Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13592-13600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas it was hypothesized that AOR catalyzed glyceraldehyde oxidation (9Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as part of an unusual nonphosphorylated Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. Most of the other enzymes of this ED pathway were subsequently demonstrated in cell extracts, albeit with very low activities (12Schäfer T. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 188-202Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar).From a very recent study, however, which used NMR and enzymatic analyses to investigate the metabolism of [13C]glucose by cell suspensions of P. furiosus, it was concluded that this occurs via an unusual Embden-Meyerhof (EM) pathway which contains ADP- (AMP-forming) rather than ATP-dependent hexose(-phosphate) kinases (13Kengen S.W.M. Debok F.A.M. Vanloo N.D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. Devos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17537-17541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar study by others (14Schäfer T. Xavier K.B. Santos H. Schönheit P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 121: 107-114Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) also concluded that an EM type of pathway was present in P. furiosus, although a version of the ED pathway was also proposed. It is not clear, however, how an EM-type pathway could function in this organism, because cell extracts contain very low activities of two key glycolytic enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (9Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schäfer T. Schönheit P. Arch.

In fact, these enzymes are thought to function in gluconeogenesis when P. furiosus is grown on pyruvate (15Schäfer T. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 354-363Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We show here that P. furiosus contains high activity of a new type of enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Fd oxidoreductase (GAPOR). This is proposed to function in place of GAPDH and possibly PGK in the novel EM-type pathway. Moreover, GAPOR represents the third tungsten-containing enzyme to be purified from P. furiosus.MATERIALS AND METHODSGrowth of the Organism and Enzyme PurificationP. furiosus (DSM 3638) was grown in the absence of S° at 90°C in a stainless steel 600-liter fermentor using maltose as the carbon source (6Bryant F.O. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5070-5079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GAPOR was purified from 100 g (wet weight) of frozen cells under strictly anaerobic conditions at 23°C. In all chromatography steps, the columns were washed with at least 1 column volume of buffer before the absorbed proteins were eluted. The techniques and procedures were the same as those used to purify P. furiosus AOR (9Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), up to and including the first chromatography step, except that sodium dithionite and glycerol were omitted from all buffers. GAPOR activity eluted from the first column (5.0 × 10 cm) of DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 0.12 M NaCl in buffer A (50 m M Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 m M dithiothreitol). Fractions containing GAPOR activity (762 mg, 6,200 units) were applied to a column (2.5 × 10 cm) of hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated with buffer A at 2.0 ml/min. Absorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (1,000 ml) from 0 to 200 m M K+ phosphate in buffer A at 2 ml/min. GAPOR activity eluted as 10 m M K+ phosphate was applied. Active fractions (310 mg, 5,250 units) were concentrated by ultrafiltration with an Amicon-type PM-30 membrane and applied to a column (1.6 × 60 cm) of Superdex 200 (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer A containing 200 m M KCl at 3 ml/min. GAPOR-containing fractions (50 mg, 4,250 units) were concentrated and washed with buffer A and then applied to a column (1.2 × 10 cm) of Blue Sepharose (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer A. Absorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (120 ml) from 0 to 300 m M KCl. GAPOR activity eluted as 180 m M KCl was applied. Those fractions containing homogenous GAPOR as judged by electrophoresis (11 mg, 1,540 units) were concentrated and stored as pellets in liquid N2.Enzyme Assays and Other MethodsThe activity of GAPOR was determined at 70°C by the reduction of benzyl viologen (3.0 m M) measured at 580 nm (molar absorbance 7,800 M−1 cm−1) in 100 m M EPPS buffer, pH 8.4 (see Ref. 9Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP, 0.4 m M) as the substrate. GAP was determined to have a half-life at 70°C of 2 min under routine assay conditions (as determined using rabbit muscle GAPDH (Sigma) at 23°C). Therefore, it was added to start the reaction in all assays of GAPOR, and activities were calculated from the first 10 s of benzyl viologen reduction. The activities of AOR (9Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and FOR (11Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13592-13600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were determined at 80°C by the oxidation of crotonaldehyde and formaldehyde, respectively. GAPDH activity was measured at 70°C by following the reduction of NAD at 340 nm (16Zwickl P. Fabry S. Bogedain C. Haas A. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4329-4338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For all enzymes, 1 unit of activity is defined as 1 μmol of substrate oxidized per min. Concentrations of 3-phosphoglycerate (0-2.0 m M) were estimated using chicken liver 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Sigma) at 23°C. Molecular weight estimation by gel filtration (Superdex 200) and SDS-electrophoresis, protein analyses, plasma emission and fluorescence spectroscopy, colorimetric iron determination, and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis were all carried out as described previously (9Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ma K. Adams M.W.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6509-6517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pterin was extracted from purified GAPOR by I2/KI treatment (9Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NADP reduction using GAP (0.4 m M) as the substrate was determined at 70°C using a system containing GAPOR (1.5 mg/ml), P. furiosus ferredoxin (0.38 mg/ml), P. furiosus ferredoxin NADP oxidoreductase (0.1 mg/ml), and NADP (0.4 m M) under previously described conditions (18Ma K. Zhou Z.H. Adams M.W.W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 122: 263-266Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPurification of GAPORAnaerobically prepared cytoplasmic extracts of three different batches of P. furiosus cells grown on maltose contained high GAPOR activity (4.7-8.2 units/mg with benzyl viologen as the electron acceptor, 1.2-2.6 units/mg using P. furiosus ferredoxin as the electron acceptor; see below), but the GAPDH activity was very low (0.07-0.09 unit/mg using the same cell extracts). Under aerobic conditions, cell extracts lost about 50% of GAPOR activity after 12 h at 23°C, but no activity was lost if the extract was maintained under argon. The enzyme was therefore purified under anaerobic conditions but in the absence of the O2-scavenger, sodium dithionite, which is an inhibitor (see below). Using DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography, GAPOR and FOR activities (eluting at 0.12 M NaCl) were separated from related activities in the cell-free extract such as AOR (0.18 M NaCl) and GAPDH (0.24 M NaCl). GAPOR also co-eluted with FOR from a hydroxyapatite column but the two were easily separated by Superdex S-200 chromatography (data not shown). Two separate purification procedures each yielded about 11 mg of purified GAPOR with a specific activity of about 140 units/mg. A 30-fold purification was achieved compared with the cell-free cytoplasmic extract.Physical Properties of GAPORAs shown in Fig. 1, purified GAPOR prepared by heating at 100°C for 10 min with SDS (1.0%, w/v) gave rise to two protein bands after SDS-electrophoresis (10%, w/v, acrylamide) which corresponded to approximate Mrvalues of 44,000 and 63,000. If the sample was not heated, only the Mr44,000 band was observed (Fig. 1), suggesting that this form of the enzyme was not completely unfolded. Incomplete denaturation by SDS treatment has also been reported for some other enzymes from P. furiosus (see Refs. 2Adams M.W.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 627-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar and 6Bryant F.O. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5070-5079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, if purified GAPOR was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10%, w/v) prior to the heat treatment step, only the Mr63,000 band was evident (Fig. 1). This band was therefore assumed to represent the fully denatured protein. Both protein bands gave the same N-terminal sequence (see below), confirming that they are different denatured forms of the same protein. Analysis of GAPOR by gel filtration (in the presence of 1.0 M NaCl) gave an Mrvalue of 60,000 ± 5,000. Together with the electrophoretic data, these results suggest that the enzyme is a monomeric protein of Mrapproximately 63,000. The presence of a single subunit was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of a solution of GAPOR which gave rise to a single sequence (M K F S V L K L D V G K R E V E A Q E I E R E D I F G V V D Y G I M R H N E). This showed no homology to the N-terminal sequences of either AOR or FOR from P. furiosus (11Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13592-13600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or to GAPDH from Pyrococcus woesei (16Zwickl P. Fabry S. Bogedain C. Haas A. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4329-4338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).GAPOR contained 0.85 ± 0.12 tungsten and 5.0 ± 1.6 iron g atoms/mol when analyzed by plasma emission spectroscopy and 5.9 ± 0.4 iron g atoms/mol by colorimetric analysis (each value is the average of two determinations using two different enzyme preparations). The enzyme as isolated gave a broad visible absorption band around 420 nm, and this decreased by nearly 50% upon addition of sodium dithionite (data not shown), consistent with the presence of iron-sulfur chromophores. The spectra were very similar to those obtained with P. furiosus AOR, which included a broad feature near 550 nm in the oxidized form (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 8Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11508-11516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Material extracted from GAPOR after acid denaturation and oxidation with I2/KI gave fluorescence spectra that were also very similar to those obtained after treating P. furiosus AOR in a similar manner (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 9Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These spectra are characteristic of a pterin-type cofactor, suggesting that the tungsten in GAPOR is present as a tungstopterin center, as it is in AOR and also FOR (10Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4848-4853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of GAPOR showed no homology to the subunits of the two other types of tungsten-containing enzymes that are known, carboxylic acid reductase (19White H. Feicht R. Huber C. Lottspeich F. Simon H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1991; 372: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase (20Schmitz R.A. Richter M. Linder D. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Notably, the tungstoenzymes AOR, FOR, and carboxylic acid reductase share a high degree of N-terminal homology (11Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13592-13600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Catalytic Properties of GAPORGAPOR was purified by its ability to oxidize GAP at 70°C using benzyl viologen as the electron acceptor. Since GAP had a half-life under assay conditions of 2 min, it was important to establish that a degradation product of GAP was not serving as a substrate for GAPOR. This was substantiated by the following. When GAP was completely degraded by a 5-min incubation at 80°C under assay conditions (there was no reduction of benzyl viologen during this process); upon the addition of GAPOR, the reduction of benzyl viologen was observed only when freshly prepared GAP was subsequently added. These results also indicated that the thermal degradation products of GAP did not inhibit GAPOR. Using GAP at concentrations of 0.01-0.50 m M (benzyl viologen, 3 m M), the Km and Vmvalues obtained from a linear double-reciprocal plot were 30 μM and 350 units/mg, respectively. There was significant inhibition of GAPOR using GAP concentrations above 0.5 m M. Using benzyl viologen at concentrations of 0.01-5.0 m M (GAP, 0.40 m M), the Km and Vmvalues were 0.43 m M and 310 units/mg, respectively. To investigate whether 3-phosphoglycerate was the product of GAPOR activity, the reaction was allowed to proceed under standard assay conditions at 70°C for 2 min. The reaction mixture was then rapidly cooled to 4°C, and the concentration of 3-phosphoglycerate was determined enzymatically to be 95 μM. This compares with a calculated value of 110 μM, based on the initial rate of benzyl viologen reduction. 3-Phosphoglycerate could not be detected if the same experiment was performed in the absence of GAPOR, which also shows that 3-phosphoglycerate was not a significant thermal degradation product of GAP.No activity was detected in the routine assay of GAPOR when benzyl viologen was replaced by NADP or NAD (each 5 m M), but P. furiosus ferredoxin did function as an electron carrier for the enzyme. The Km and Vmvalues calculated from a linear Lineweaver-Burk plot were approximately 6 μM and 90 units/mg, respectively (using 0.1-50 μM ferredoxin and 0.40 m M GAP). Using GAP at concentrations of 0.01-0.50 m M (ferredoxin, 100 μM), the Km and Vmvalues obtained were 28 μM and 78 units/mg, respectively. The high activity obtained with ferredoxin as the electron carrier and the high affinity of GAPOR for both GAP and ferredoxin suggest that these are the physiological substrates. Since NADPH rather than reduced ferredoxin is the physiological electron donor to the H2-evolving hydrogenase of P. furiosus (18Ma K. Zhou Z.H. Adams M.W.W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 122: 263-266Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine if GAP oxidation could be coupled to NADP reduction. A combination of GAPOR, ferredoxin, and P. furiosus ferredoxin NADP oxidoreductase (FNOR, Ref. 17Ma K. Adams M.W.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6509-6517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reduced NADP at a rate of 88 μmol/min/mg (of FNOR) at 70°C, suggesting that in vivo, reductant from the GAPOR reaction could be readily converted to NADPH and disposed of via hydrogenase as H2.There was no detectable reduction of benzyl viologen when GAP was replaced in the routine assay of GAPOR at 70°C by acetaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, formaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, glyceraldehyde (measured at 40°C, see Ref. 9Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glycerol 3-phosphate, or glyoxalate, each at a concentration of 1.0 or 10 m M. Similarly, there was no significant effect on the activity of GAPOR using GAP as the substrate when glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, glycerol 3-phosphate, or phosphoglycolate, each at a concentration of 10 m M, were included in the routine assay. The presence of crotonaldehyde (10 m M) or formaldehyde (10 m M) decreased GAPOR activity by approximately 25%, whereas acetyl phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, or 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (each 10 m M) stimulated GAPOR activity by between 58 and 93%.When sodium dithionite was added to GAPOR (1.0 mg/ml in 50 m M Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 3.0 m M, less than 50% of the GAP oxidation activity was observed. When the dithionite was then removed from the enzyme by gel filtration, approximately 70% of the original specific activity was recovered. The substrate specificity of GAPOR was unaffected when the enzyme was prepared with and without dithionite. The substrate specificities of AOR and FOR from P. furiosus (which are purified in the presence of sodium dithionite) were also unaffected when sodium dithionite was removed (in particular, GAP was not a substrate for either enzyme). GAPOR was routinely assayed in the absence of phosphate ions and its activity was unaffected by the presence of 5 m M K+ phosphate in the assay medium. However, K+ phosphate at a concentration of 200 m M stimulated GAPOR activity by approximately 3.5-fold, and Na+ arsenate (200 m M) had a similar effect. By analogy with GAPDH, which generates 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate from GAP, these results suggest that GAPOR in the presence of phosphate might also produce 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. We could not detect 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (using rabbit muscle GAPDH at 25°C) as a product of the GAPOR reaction when the standard assay was carried out for 2 min at 70°C in the presence of 200 m M K+ phosphate, whereas the concentration of 3-phosphoglycerate produced under these conditions was determined enzymatically to be 285 μM, which was in good agreement with the calculated value (350 μM, based on the initial rate of benzyl viologen reduction). This result is not conclusive, however, because 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is very unstable and rapidly hydrolyzes to 3-phosphoglycerate and inorganic phosphate (even at 25°C, Ref. 21Negelin E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 216-220Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and so it may have rapidly degraded under assay conditions. On the other hand, GAPOR activity was also stimulated about 3.5-fold by the presence of potassium chloride, sodium citrate, or sodium sulfate (each 200 m M), showing that there is general enhancement of GAPOR activity by high ionic strength and particularly by polyanions, including phosphate.Physiological Function of GAPORThe oxidation of GAP to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and its conversion to 3-phosphoglycerate is usually accomplished by a combination of the glycolytic enzymes, GAPDH and PGK. The activities of these two enzymes in maltose-grown P. furiosus are both very low when assayed in the glycolytic direction (≤0.06 units/mg at 90°C, Refs. 13Kengen S.W.M. Debok F.A.M. Vanloo N.D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. Devos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17537-17541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 15Schäfer T. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1993; 159: 354-363Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), yet it has been shown that an EM-type glycolytic pathway is the predominant route for glucose oxidation in this organism (13Kengen S.W.M. Debok F.A.M. Vanloo N.D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. Devos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17537-17541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore seems reasonable to suggest that GAPOR is a glycolytic enzyme and functions in place of GAPDH and PGK. As shown in Fig. 2, it is proposed that GAPOR produces 3-phosphoglycerate and that the reductant is disposed of as H2via NADPH (see Ref. 18Ma K. Zhou Z.H. Adams M.W.W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 122: 263-266Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). An attractive feature of this pathway is that all of the enzymes involved exhibit-specific activities of greater than 0.5 units/mg at 70−90°C using cell-free extracts of maltose-grown P. furiosus (2Adams M.W.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 627-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Bryant F.O. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol.

Moreover, assuming that the ADP required for hexose(-phosphate) activation is readily available from anabolic processes (13Kengen S.W.M. Debok F.A.M. Vanloo N.D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. Devos W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17537-17541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the proposed pathway yields 4 mol of ATP/mol of glucose oxidized to acetate, which is in accordance with growth yield data (see Refs. 12Schäfer T. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 188-202Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Kengen S.W.M. Debok F.A.M. Vanloo N.D. Dijkema C. Stams A.J.M. Devos W.M. J. Biol.

We cannot exclude the possibility that in vivo GAPOR produces 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, but this would seem unlikely since (a) if 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate was used by PGK to generate ATP, the overall ATP yield (6 ATP/glucose) would exceed that determined experimentally (see Refs. 12Schäfer T.

Microbiol. 1992; 158: 188-202Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Indeed, the operation of this ED pathway is also questionable in light of the very low activities of some of the enzymes involved (12Schäfer T. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 188-202Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A notable exception in this regard is AOR (9Mukund S. Adams M.W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14208-14216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which perhaps necessitates a reevaluation of its physiological function. In any event, we have demonstrated that P. furiosus GAPOR is distinct from AOR and also from FOR, the other tungstoenzymes in this organism. GAPOR is also unrelated to GAPDH or to any other known tungstoprotein. The enzyme is present at a relatively high cellular concentration (about 3% of the total protein), consistent both with its function in the primary pathway of sugar metabolism and with the dependence of cell growth upo"

A cell-free preparation from sapling yew stems catalyzed the conversion of [1-3H]geranylgeranyl diphosphate to a cyclic diterpene olefin that, when incubated with stem sections, was converted in good radiochemical yield to several highly functionalized taxanes, including 10-deacetyl baccatin III and taxol itself. Addition of the labeled olefin to a yew bark extract, followed by radiochemically guided fractionation, provided sufficient product to establish the structure as taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopic methods. Therefore, the first dedicated step in taxol biosynthesis is the conversion of the universal diterpenoid precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate to taxa-4(5),11 (12)-diene, rather than to the 4(20),11(12)-diene isomer previously suggested on the basis of the abundance of taxoids with double bonds in these positions. The very common occurrence of taxane derivatives bearing the 4(20)-ene-5-oxy functional grouping, and the lack of oxygenated derivatives bearing a 4(5)-double bond, suggest that hydroxylation at C-5 of taxadiene with allylic rearrangement of the double bond is an early step in the conversion of this olefin intermediate to taxol.

The highly functionalized diterpenoid taxol (paclitaxel) 1Paclitaxel is the generic name for taxol, which is now a registered trademark of Bristol-Myers Squibb. Because of the far greater familiarity with the word taxol, we use it here in lieu of “paclitaxel.” 1 (1Wani M.C. Taylor H.L. Wall M.E. Coggon P. McPhail A.T. J. Am. Chem.

A principal limitation to the wider therapeutic use of taxol was the limited supply of the drug isolated from the bark of Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia Nutt.:Taxaceae); the yields are low (0.01-0.1% dry weight), the species is very slow growing and sparsely distributed, and the harvest is destructive (3Cragg G.M.

Total synthesis of taxol, at present, is not commercially viable (17Borman S. Chem. Eng. News. 1994; 72: 32-34Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and efficient and economical supply of the drug must rely on biological production systems for the foreseeable future (18Cragg G.M. Schepartz S.A. Suffness M. Grever M.R. J. Nat. Prod. 1993; 56: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is essential to understand the origin of taxol and related taxoids in yew species from the universal precursor of plant diterpenoids, geranylgeranyl diphosphate 3 (19West C.A. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1981: 375-411Google Scholar). To this end, we have undertaken a systematic study of taxol biosynthesis at the enzyme level, with the goal of targeting the slow steps of the pathway for ultimate manipulation. The biosynthesis of taxol 1 (Scheme 1) is presumed to involve cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate 3, via (1 S)-verticillene 4, to taxa-4(20),11(12)-diene 5 (20Harrison J.W. Scrowston R.M.

Chem. Org. Nat. Prod. 1993; 61: 1-206Google Scholar). Such a cyclization to establish the taxane skeleton could then be followed by oxidative elaboration of this diterpene olefin intermediate (22Guéritte-Voegelein F. Guénard D. Potier P. J. Nat.

Previous investigations on taxol biosynthesis have involved feeding early precursors, such as labeled acetate, to various yew tissue preparations (25Strobel G.A. Stierle A. van Kuijk F.J.G.M. Plant Sci. 1992; 84: 65-74Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Zamir L.O. Nedea M.E. Garneau F.X. Tetrahedron Letts. 1992; 33: 5235-5236Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), or have focused on late stage modifications to the taxane nucleus, such as the origin of appended acyl moieties (27Fleming P.E.

Soc. 1994; 116: 4137-4138Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). No experimental work on the enzymology of taxol biosynthesis has been reported, and the first dedicated step of the pathway and the identity of the presumed olefinic precursor of taxol have remained uncertain. In this communication, we describe the enzymatic cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to taxa-4(5),11(12) -diene as the first committed reaction, and a very slow step, of taxol biosynthesis. Two-year-old T. brevifolia saplings in active growth were obtained from the Weyerhaeuser Research Center, Centralia, WA. [1-3H]Geranylgeranyl diphosphate (118 Ci/mol) was prepared as described previously (29LaFever R.E. Stofer Vogel B. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Bark extracts and taxoid standards (taxol, cephalomannine, and baccatin III, and their 10-deacetyl derivatives) were obtained from Hauser Chemical Research Inc., Boulder, CO. (+)-Taxusin was isolated from the wood of T. brevifolia (30Della Casa De Marcano D.P. Halsall G. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1969; : 1282-1283Crossref Google Scholar). Other diterpenoid standards were from our own collection. Methods previously developed for the isolation and assay of terpenoid cyclases from conifer stem tissue were employed (29LaFever R.E. Stofer Vogel B. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Lewinsohn E. Gijzen M. Savage T.J. Croteau R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Yew sapling stem sections were frozen in liquid N2and pulverized in a hammer mill to separate the bark and adhering tissue from the woody core. The resulting “bark” powder was extracted with a buffer containing vinylpyrrolidone polymers and polystyrene resin to adsorb phenolics, and the 27,000 × g supernatant was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (31Lewinsohn E. Gijzen M. Savage T.J. Croteau R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The preparation was then dialyzed to assay conditions (30 m M HEPES (pH 8.0), 5 m M dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) and adjusted to ∼50 μg of protein/ml before incubation in the presence of 10 μM geranylgeranyl diphosphate and 1 m M MgCl2(29LaFever R.E. Stofer Vogel B. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Following incubation (1-3 h), the pentane-soluble products of the reaction mixture were extracted and the extract passed through a short column of silica gel to provide the hydrocarbon fraction. Quantification was by aliquot counting, and the products were analyzed by radio-GLC. 2The abbreviations used are:GLCgas-liquid chromatographyCCcolumn chromatographyDEPTdistortionless enhancement by polarization transferDQF-COSYdouble quantum filter homonuclear correlated spectroscopyHETCORheteronuclear correlationHMBCheteronuclear multiple bond correlationHMQCheteronuclear multiple quantum correlationHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometryTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopy.

The biosynthetic olefin (5.36 μCi of 3H) that had been purified by CC (silica gel; pentane) and argentation TLC (silica gel; 10% AgNO3:pentane) was suspended by sonication in a buffer (1.5 ml) consisting of 5 m M KH2PO4(pH 5.5), 10 m M sucrose, 2 m M KCl, 2 m M phenylalanine, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 1 m M MgCl2, 1 m M sodium acetate, 1 m M sodium benzoate, 0.2 m M EDTA, 0.1 m M Na2H2P2O7, and 0.05% Tween 20. Following filter sterilization, the suspension was split and vacuum-infiltrated (six times) into two 1.75-g batches of yew stem discs (1-2 mm thick) prepared from sapling stem sections that had been surface-sterilized in 70% ethanol (1 s), followed by 3% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% Tween 20 (1 min) and washing, and then sectioned using sterile technique. The tissue was incubated for 8 days at room temperature, in air, in the light with slow shaking in a glass vial and then thoroughly extracted with hexane (2 × 10 ml), which was passed through a silica gel column that was rinsed with diethyl ether:pentane (1:1) to remove residual substrate and labeled metabolites less polar than (+)-taxusin. The column was then rinsed with 10 ml of chloroform:acetonitrile:methanol (6:3:1), and this material was used to extract the tissue, as before. The process was repeated with three additional portions of chloroform:acetonitrile:methanol, at which point a methanol extraction afforded no additional extracted radioactivity. This taxoid fraction was decolorized, without loss of tritium, by elution through Davisil (Alltech C18on silica) with a gradient from 55% water, 25% methanol, 20% acetonitrile to 100% acetonitrile. Approximately 90% of the applied tracer was recovered in organic solvent-soluble products. Aliquots of the taxoid fraction were analyzed by HPLC on a 250 mm × 4.6-mm Econosil C8 column (5 μm, Alltech) by gradient elution (30 ml) from solvent A (55% water, 25% methanol, 20% acetonite) to 75% solvent A plus 25% solvent B (acetonitrile), while collecting 1-ml fractions for liquid scintillation counting. Retention times of the standards were as follows: 10-deacetylbaccatin III (3.08 min), baccatin III (5.24 min), 10-deacetylcephalomannine (20.48 min), 10-deacetyltaxol (22.99 min), cephalomannine (26.21 min), and taxol (27.82 min). The taxoid fraction was subsequently diluted with 2 mg each of 10-deacetylbaccatin III, cephalomannine, and taxol and subjected to preparative TLC on silica gel G with chloroform:methanol (20:1). The products (10-deacetylbaccatin III, RF 0.17; cephalomannine plus taxol, RF 0.47-0.51) were eluted with methanol, diluted with an additional 200 mg of authentic carrier, and crystallized from aqueous methanol to constant specific activity and m.p. Because cephalomannine and taxol were not separable, the eluted mixture was split in half; one-half was diluted with cephalomannine, the other with taxol. Repeated crystallization gave 10-deacetylbaccatin III, 150 nCi/mmol, m.p. 243−245°C decomposes cephalomannine, 14.0 nCi/mmol, m.p. 183−186°C decomposes taxol, 31.7 nCi/mmol, m.p. 215−218°C decomposes. All m.p. values are in agreement with the literature (23Kingston D.G.I. Molinero A.A. Rimoldi J.M. Prog. Chem. Org. Nat. Prod. 1993; 61: 1-206Google Scholar). An extract from 750 kg of T. brevifolia bark powder, that had been enriched in non-polar materials by partitioning from methanol into heptane, was batch processed through silica gel with hexane to afford a hydrocarbon fraction (3.1 g). This material was diluted with 0.5 μCi of the enzymatically prepared olefin and chromatographed repeatedly on a silica gel column with hexane, while monitoring fractions by liquid scintillation counting and GLC-MS, to yield a fraction (230 mg; >90% recovery of label) eluting between sandaracopimaradiene and abietatriene. This material, a very complex mixture of sesquiterpene and diterpene hydrocarbons, was next purified by argentation column chromatography (10% AgNO3-silica gel with a 0 to 10% gradient of Et2O in pentane) to afford 72 mg of an oil. Another passage through silica gel (with pentane) followed by reversed-phase column chromatography on Davisil (Alltech C18on silica, 2.5-20% CCl4in acetonitrile) and argentation TLC (10% AgNO3-silica gel with 5% ether in pentane) yielded about 1 mg of 85% taxadiene (RF 0.8-0.9, with 2% mixed sesquiterpene olefins and 11% abietatriene). NMR spectra were recorded at 499.8 MHz (1H, DQF-COSY, TOCSY) and at 125.7 MHz (13C(1H), DEPT, HETCOR) on a Varian VXR-500S instrument, and at 300.1 MHz (HMQC, HMBC) using a Bruker AMX-300 instrument. All experiments were run at ambient temperature (21°C) with a 5 μM solution in CDCl3. Chemical shifts are reported in δ (ppm) using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The DQF-COSY (32Piatini U. Soerenson O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1888) Google Scholar) and TOCSY (33Griesinger C. Otting G. Wuetrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) experiments (mixing time 60 ms) were run in the phase sensitive mode. The 512 t1increments of 96 scans each were sampled in 2000 data points for each of the 512 t1increments. Zero-filling the F1 domain to 2000 and a Gaussian weighting function were applied in both F1and F2domains prior to double Fourier transformation. The HETCOR (34Bax A. Morris G.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 42: 501-505Google Scholar) spectrum was obtained using 2000 data points in the F2domain and 256 t1increments (800 scans each), which were zero-filled to 1000 in the F1domain. A sine-bell squared weighting function phase shifted by π/2 was applied in both domains prior to double Fourier transformation. The HMQC spectrum was measured employing the pulse sequence of Bax et al. (35Bax A. Griffey R.H. Hawkins B.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 55: 301-315Google Scholar). Delay Δ was set to 3.571 ms corresponding to the average one bond carbon-proton coupling constant, 145 Hz. In this experiment, 256 t1increments were sampled in 2000 data points using 464 scans for each of the t1increments. Data in the F1domain were zero-filled to 1000, and the sine-bell squared weighting function phase shifted by π/2 was applied in both F1and F2domains prior to double Fourier transformation. Analogous parameters were adopted for the HMBC spectrum that was obtained using the pulse sequence of Bax and Summers (36Bax A. Summers M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2093-2094Crossref Scopus (3274) Google Scholar) and involved low-pass J-filtering to suppress correlations due to one-bond couplings. Delay Δ2was set to 62.5 ms corresponding to the average long range (through two or three bonds) carbon-proton coupling constant, 8 Hz. Radio-GLC was performed on a Gow-Mac 550P gas chromatograph coupled to a Packard 894 gas proportional counter (37Satterwhite D.M. Croteau R. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 452: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using a 30 m × 0.53-mm diameter fused silica column coated with a 1.2-μm film of Superox FA (Alltech); 8 p.s.i. He, isothermal at 200°C with injector and detector at 220°C. GLC-MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5840A/5985B system using a 30 m × 0.25-mm diameter fused silica column with 0.25-μm film of Superox FA (Alltech) operated at 10 p.s.i. H2and programmed from 100°C (5-min hold) at 10°C/min to 220°C. Electron impact spectra were recorded at 70 eV. Pacific yew saplings were chosen as an experimental system because the taxoid content of immature tissue is relatively high (9Vidensek N. Lim P. Campbell A. Carlson C. J. Nat. Prod. 1990; 53: 1609-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), sapling stems contain a high proportion of phloem parenchyma cells in which taxol is thought to be produced (25Strobel G.A. Stierle A. van Kuijk F.J.G.M. Plant Sci. 1992; 84: 65-74Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 38Ellis, D., Zeldin, E., Russin, W., Brodhagen, M., Evert, R., McCown, B., (1993) Proceedings of the International Yew Research Conference, (Native Yew Conservation Council), Berkeley, CA, March 12-13, 1993.Google Scholar, 39Strobel G.A. Stierle A. Hess W.M. Plant Sci. 1993; 92: 1-12Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and saplings can be maintained in a greenhouse to minimize the effects of environmental variation (10Wheeler N.C. Jech K. Masters S. Brobst S.W. Alvarado A.B. Hoover A.J. Snader K.M. J. Nat. Prod. 1992; 55: 432-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 40Vance N.C. Kelsey R.G. Sabin T.E. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 1241-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A soluble enzyme extract was prepared from T. brevifolia stem sections by methods previously developed for the isolation of other terpenoid cyclases from gymnosperm stem that minimize the deleterious effects of co-extracted phenolic materials (31Lewinsohn E. Gijzen M. Savage T.J. Croteau R. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Incubation of this preparation with 10 μM [1-3H]geranylgeranyl diphosphate, in the presence of 1 m M MgCl2, yielded radiolabeled, pentane-soluble products that were purified by column chromatography on silica gel to afford the hydrocarbon fraction (1 nmol; 5% conversion in 1 h). The production of the hydrocarbon material from geranylgeranyl diphosphate by the enzyme preparation was absolutely dependent on the presence of the divalent metal ion, as expected for a terpenoid cyclase (41Alonso W.R. Croteau R. Methods Plant Biochem. 1993; 9: 239-260Google Scholar), and negligible activity was observed in thermally inactivated control incubations. Radio-GLC analysis of the hydrocarbon fraction revealed the presence of a single major component that eluted between the tricyclic diterpene olefin standards sandaracopimaradiene and abietatriene (Fig. 1 a). To determine if this presumptive diterpene olefin could serve as a precursor of taxol, the purified biosynthetic product (5.36 μCi) was suspended in buffer and vacuum-infiltrated into two batches of T. brevifolia stem discs. Following incubation for 8 days, the labeled products were extracted and separated into a taxoid fraction containing metabolites more polar than (+)-taxusin (the tetraacetate of taxa-4(20), 11(12) -dien-5,9,10,13-tetraol). This fraction represented about 30% incorporation of radioactivity from the olefin and, when separated by reversed-phase radio-HPLC, revealed the presence of at least a dozen labeled compounds of polarity between 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-deacetyl 2, Rt 3.08 min) and taxol 1 (Rt 27.82 min), including the common bark taxoids baccatin III 2, cephalomannine 6, and taxol, and their 10-deacetyl derivatives (40Vance N.C. Kelsey R.G. Sabin T.E. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 1241-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). Negligible incorporation of olefin label into this taxoid fraction was observed in control experiments with thermally inactivated tissue. To confirm the identity of the labeled taxoids, 10-deacetylbaccatin III, cephalomannine, and taxol (for which substantial amounts of authentic standards were available) were isolated by TLC, diluted with the corresponding unlabeled carrier, and crystallized to constant specific activity and melting point, thereby verifying the incorporation of the tritium-labeled olefin into 10-deacetylbaccatin III (4.1%), cephalomannine (0.5%), and taxol (1.1%). (The incorporation percentages should be regarded as minimum levels, as some tritium label (depending on the kinetic isotope effect) will be lost on oxidation at C-2 (Scheme 1) of the taxane skeleton of these advanced metabolites.) It is not uncommon for the level of 10-deacetylbaccatin III to exceed the levels of taxol and cephalomannine in T. brevifolia stem tissue (40Vance N.C. Kelsey R.G. Sabin T.E. Phytochemistry. 1994; 36: 1241-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the diterpene olefin product of the cell-free system did serve as a precursor of taxol and other very closely related taxoids of yew stem, thus suggesting that the cyclization product of geranylgeranyl diphosphate was a taxadiene. To identify the biosynthetic diterpene olefin product, it was necessary to acquire sufficient material for spectroscopic analysis. To this end, the hydrocarbon fraction from an extract of 750 kg of dried T. brevifolia bark powder was diluted with 0.5 μCi of the enzymatically derived, tritium-labeled olefin, and the corresponding product (∼1 mg) was isolated by radiochemically guided chromatographic fractionation. The mass spectrum of the product gave principal ions at m/z 122 (100%), 107 (26%), 121 (25%), 123 (20%), and 105 (10%), and a parent ion at m/z 272 (1.5%) consistent with a cyclic diterpene olefin of molecular formula C20H32. Radio-GLC analysis of the isolated product demonstrated coincidental elution of radioactivity and the principal mass peak, as expected. Based on recovery, it was estimated that the level of this olefin in bark tissue was in the 5-10 μg/kg range. The structure of the diterpene olefin was determined to be taxa-4(5), 11(12) -diene 7 by analysis of one- and two-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Proton connectivities were determined by DQF-COSY and TOCSY experiments, and the signals of all carbons with directly attached protons were assigned using HETCOR and HMQC spectra. Finally, the HMBC spectrum was used to assign quaternary carbons and to check the correctness of the connectivities established by the interpretation of the other spectra. The 13C DEPT experiment revealed a total of 20 carbon resonances (Table I), of which five corresponded to methyl carbons, seven to methylene carbons, three to methine carbons, and five to non-proton bearing carbons. One of the methine resonances and three non-proton bearing carbon resonances occurred in the downfield region: 120.0-140.0 ppm. All remaining carbon resonances were in the high field region: 20.0-45.0 ppm.Table I:1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts δ (ppm) for taxa-4(5),11(12)-diene measured in CDCl3solution at 293 K with tetramethylsilane as internal standard The 1H NMR spectrum (Table I) showed a one-proton multiplet (∑J = 11.1 Hz) at δ 5.28. All other signals were in the region from 0.65 to 2.63 ppm. In the TOCSY spectrum, the olefinic CH-5 (δ 5.28) proton multiplet exhibited cross-peaks to four different sets of protons corresponding to the methylene CH2-6 (δ 1.88, 2.01) and CH2-7 (δ 1.18, 1.67) protons, the methine CH-3 (δ 2.51) proton, and the methyl CH3-20 (δ 1.68) protons. By analyzing the HETCOR spectrum, the carbon signals at δ 24.0, 38.4, 39.7, and 121.1 were assigned to C-20, C-7, C-3, and C-5, respectively; they correlated with the corresponding proton signals (see above). The resonances of the C-3 and C-7 carbons showed a cross-peak with the proton singlet at δ 0.82 in the HMBC spectrum. Therefore, the proton signal was assigned to the methyl CH3-19 protons. Additionally, this proton resonance (δ 0.82) correlated with another two carbon signals at δ37.2 and 41.4, corresponding to the quaternary C-8 and methylene CH2-9 carbons, respectively. That the signal at δ37.2 belonged to a quaternary carbon, and the signal at δ 41.4 to a methylene carbon, was further supported by the DEPT data. Analysis of the HMBC spectrum also allowed the carbon signal at δ 138.5 to be assigned to the olefinic C-4 carbon, as it exhibited a cross-peak with the methyl CH3-20 proton signal (δ 1.68) due to a two-bond linkage. The methylene CH2-9 proton signals at δ 1.42 and 1.82 were identified based upon their correlation with the C-9 carbon signal at δ 41.4 in the HETCOR spectrum. Following the interpretation of the TOCSY and DQF-COSY spectra, the methylene CH2-2 and CH2-10 proton signals were assigned. The CH-3 proton signal (δ 2.51) displayed two cross-peaks at δ 1.57 and 1.66, corresponding to the methylene CH2-2 protons. One of the CH2-9 proton signals (δ 1.42) correlated with the signal at δ2.15, and the other signal (δ 1.82) showed a cross-peak at δ2.61. Therefore, both signals at δ2.15 and 2.61 were assigned to the methylene CH2-10 protons. Moreover, they exhibited a mutual cross-peak due to geminal coupling. In addition, both correlated with the carbon signal at δ24.5 in the HETCOR spectrum. Consequently, the latter was assigned to the C-10 carbon. The HETCOR analysis also allowed the carbon signal at δ28.4 to be assigned to the C-2 carbon. The gem-dimethyl groups (CH3-16, CH3-17) attached to the quaternary C-15 carbon of the taxadiene A-ring were easily identified in the HMBC spectrum. Both methyl proton resonances at δ 1.01 (CH3-16) and 1.33 (CH3-17) displayed cross-peaks with the same carbon signals at δ 44.2, 137.7, and 39.0, corresponding to the carbons C-1, C-11, and C-15, respectively. Furthermore, the CH3-16 proton resonance correlated with the carbon CH3-17 signal at δ26.3 (assigned using HETCOR analysis) and, due to the same three-bond coupling, the proton signal of the methyl CH3-17 correlated with the carbon CH3-16 resonance at δ30.7 (assignment based on HETCOR analysis). HMBC analysis also revealed the correlation of the carbon C-11 resonance with the proton singlet at δ 1.66. At the same time, this proton resonance exhibited cross-peaks with the carbon signals at δ 29.8 and 129.5. These facts allowed assignment of the proton resonance at δ 1.66 to the methyl CH3-18 protons; the carbon signals were assigned as the methylene CH2-13 carbon (δ 29.8) and the olefinic carbon C-12 (δ 129.5). Having established the carbon resonances of the methine CH-1 and methylene CH2-13, the HETCOR analysis permitted assignment of the proton signals of the groups at δ 1.74 (CH-1), and at δ 1.88 and 2.08 (CH2-13). Both the methylene CH2-13 proton resonances, as well as the methine CH-1 proton resonance, exhibited cross-peaks at δ 1.59 and 2.08 in the DQF-COSY spectrum. At the same time, these two proton signals (δ 1.59, 2.08) showed a mutual cross-peak. Therefore, they were assigned to the methylene CH2-14 protons. Only one of the CH2-14 proton resonances displayed a cross-peak with the carbon signal at δ 22.6 in the HETCOR spectrum. However, this signal (δ 22.6) corresponded to a methylene carbon based upon the DEPT data and was assigned to C-14. The remaining unassigned methylene carbon resonance at δ 23.2 was then assigned to the methylene CH2-6, even though no cross-peak between protons and carbon of the CH2-6 group could be identified in the HETCOR and HMQC spectra. The assignment of each carbon and hydrogen of the C20H32 olefin left little doubt that the product was taxa-4(5), 11(20) -diene 7. To confirm that the biosynthetic product generated in yew stem extracts and the olefin isolated from bark were the same, large scale enzyme incubations with geranylgeranyl diphosphate were carried out and the olefin fraction was analyzed by combined GLC-MS. The retention time and mass spectrum of the enzymatic product (>99% pure) were identical to those of taxa-4(5), 11(12) -diene isolated from the bark extract (Fig. 1, b and c). (1 S)-Verticillene 4, a possible enzyme-bound intermediate in the cyclization, was not detectable as a product of the cell-free extract. The cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to taxa-4(5),11(12) -diene, as the first dedicated step in the biosynthesis of taxol and related metabolites, is consistent with earlier suggestions that the pathway involves preliminary formation of a parent taxane olefin followed by oxidative modification (20Harrison J.W. Scrowston R.M. Lythgoe B. J. Chem. Soc. C. 1966; : 1933-1945Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Begley M.J. Jackson C.B. Pattenden G.

However, the identification of taxa-4(5), 11(12) -diene 7 as the olefinic intermediate, rather than taxa-4(20), 11(12) -diene 5 as originally proposed on the basis of metabolite co-occurrence (22Guéritte-Voegelein F. Guénard D. Potier P. J. Nat. Prod. 1987; 50: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), was unexpected. Consequently, the previously proposed cyclization to 5 (20Harrison J.W. Scrowston R.M. Lythgoe B. J. Chem. Soc. C. 1966; : 1933-1945Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Begley M.J. Jackson C.B. Pattenden G. Tetrahedron. 1990; 46: 4907-4924Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1) can be reformulated as involving ionization of the geranylgeranyl diphosphate ester with closure of the first ring and deprotonation to afford (1 S)-verticillene. Protonation at C-7 can then initiate transannular cyclization to generate the taxenyl cation, which upon deprotonation at C-5 yields the endocyclic double bond of the taxadiene product. The next step of the pathway to taxol is presumed to involve oxygenation of taxadiene (22Guéritte-Voegelein F. Guénard D. Potier P. J. Nat. Prod. 1987; 50: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Floss H.G. Mocek U. Suffness M. Taxol: Science and Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar). The observations that no oxygenated taxoids bearing the 4(5) -double bond have yet been reported, whereas taxoids with the exo-methylene at the 4(20) -position and that also bear an oxygen function at C-5 are exceedingly common (23Kingston D.G.I. Molinero A.A. Rimoldi J.M. Prog. Chem. Org. Nat. Prod. 1993; 61: 1-206Google Scholar), therefore suggest that hydroxylation at C-5 of taxa-4(5),11(12) -diene, with migration of the double bond, must occur as an early, if not the first, oxygenation step of the pathway (Scheme 2). The transformation of taxa-4(5), 11(12) -diene 7 to taxa-4(20), 11(12) -diene-5-ol 8 would also set the stage for the later elaboration of the unusual oxetane moiety 11, which is considered (22Guéritte-Voegelein F. Guénard D. Potier P. J. Nat. Prod. 1987; 50: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Floss H.G. Mocek U. Suffness M. Taxol: Science and Applications. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar) to arise by conversion of the 5-hydroxy-4(20) -methylene 9 to the corresponding epoxide function 10 followed by ring expansion (Scheme 2). Although the enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to taxadiene has not yet been characterized in any detail, the low cyclization activity in T. brevifolia stem extracts relative to that of other diterpene cyclases of gymnosperm stem tissue (29LaFever R.E. Stofer Vogel B. Croteau R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), coupled to the very low levels of this key olefin intermediate in the bark, suggest that the cyclization step to generate the taxane skeleton is very slow (relative to subsequent oxygenations) and, thus, is an important target for manipulation. With the initial step of taxol biosynthesis in Pacific yew now defined, it would be of interest to determine if the taxol-producing fungus Taxomyces andreanae (42Stierle A. Strobel G. Stierle D. Science. 1993; 260: 214-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar) employs a similar cyclization reaction. We thank David Bailey (Hauser Chemical Research Inc., Boulder, CO) for the bark extract and authentic taxoid standards, Nicholas Wheeler (Weyerhaeuser Research Center, Centralia, WA) for the T. brevifolia saplings, and Gerald Pattenden (University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom) for the mass spectrum of verticillene."

These studies identify a novel role for the NP XY motif in the regulation of integrin binding affinity. The regulated adhesion of cells to each other or to elements in the extracellular environment is crucial in normal physiology. The integrins, a widely distributed family of α,β heterodimers (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar), mediate many of these events. Members of this family are characterized by an ability to dynamically regulate their ligand binding affinity. In a process termed “activation” or “inside-out signaling,” integrins change extracellular conformation and alter ligand binding affinity and cellular adhesion (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar). Following ligand binding, events are triggered inside the cell. “Outside-in signaling” events include changes in cell shape, integrin localization, intracellular pH, induction of protein phosphorylation, and gene transcription (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9002) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic sequences of the integrins appear to be involved in these bi-directional signaling events. Indeed, several functions have been associated with the β subunit cytoplasmic domain. For instance, these sequences contain sufficient information for specifying localization to focal adhesions (2LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. J.

Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Independent expression of β tails results in an inhibition of endogenous integrin function in matrix assembly, cell spreading, and cell migration (2LaFlamme S.E. Thomas L.A. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M.

Mounting evidence implicates a role for both α and β cytoplasmic domains in inside-out signaling and the maintenance of high affinity binding. The identity of the α tail determines the affinity state of recombinant integrins expressed in heterologous cells (20O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C.

On the other hand, a point mutation in the β3tail has been associated with an activation defect of αIIbβ3both in vivo (22Chen Y.-P. Djaffar I. Pidard D. Steiner B. Cieutat A.-M. Caen J. Rosa J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10169-10173Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and in a recombinant system (20O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Furthermore, independent coexpression of the β, but not the α, cytoplasmic domain can abolish ligand binding by constitutively active, transfected integrins (23Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known regarding specific α or β cytoplasmic residues required for high affinity binding or how these relate to other functional areas in these domains. To map these sequences in the β subunit, we have mutagenized the β1and β3tails, joined them onto extracellular and transmembrane β3, and coexpressed these variants with αIIbcytoplasmic chimeras that confer constitutive ligand binding properties (20O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The affinity state of these transfectants was determined by analyzing their ability to bind PAC1 (24Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the active conformation of the reporter group, αIIbβ3. Our results have identified several residues whose substitution reduces constitutive ligand binding. Complete abolition of PAC1 binding was observed with variants in an NP XY sequence. This role in affinity modulation identifies a novel function for this motif. Furthermore, these studies discount a role for phosphorylation of integrin tails in the regulation of binding affinity and suggest cytoplasmic splice variants which lack these sequence elements may be unresponsive to normal inside-out signaling pathways. The purification and characterization of several antibodies (D57, anti-LIBS6, PAC1) has been described elsewhere (20O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while a polyclonal antibody against β3was generated by previously described methods (26Plow E.F. Loftus J.C. Levin E. Fair D. Dixon D. Forsyth J. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6002-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The antibody D57 was biotinylated with biotin- N-hydroxysuccinimide (Sigma) according to manufacturer's directions. A peptide-mimetic compound (Ro43-5054), which specifically blocks binding to αIIbβ3, was a generous gift from Beat Steiner (F. Hoffman LaRoche, Basel, Switzerland). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a model 391 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Restriction endonucleases, TaqI polymerase, and other enzymes were from Boehringer Mannheim. The generation of several wild type (β3), chimeric (β3β1, αIIbα5, αIIbα6A, αIIbα6B), or mutant (β3Δ724, β3S752P) integrin constructs has been described previously (20O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 21O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J.

Blood. 1989; 74: 14-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional β chimera were made by exchanging mutant β1cytoplasmic domains for those from wild type β3. Sequences encoding the β1mutants S790M, T793V/T794V, and N797I were recovered by HindIII digestion of the appropriate pRneo constructs (28Reszka A.A. Yokichi Y. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and ligated into HindIII-cut pCDM8 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). These vectors were then digested with BspHI and DraIII, and the fragment containing β1cytoplasmic sequences was ligated to a corresponding BspHI- DraIII fragment from CD3a (27O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Plow E.F. Glass A.A. Harper J.R. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 14-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing β3transmembrane and extracellular domains. Cytoplasmic sequences encoding the β1variants F771L, E774V, N785I, Y788A, YTRF, S790D, Y800F, and Y800A were first amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with the 5′ oligonucleotide: GTAAAATCACTGCAGTTTGCCCTA, and the 3′ oligonucleotide: TTGATTTGGAAGCTTCTGATGATC. Amplified fragments were digested with HindIII and PstI and ligated into HindIII- and PstI-digested pCDM8. These constructs were then digested with BspHI and DraIII and ligated as above to a corresponding BspHI- DraIII fragment from CD3a. The Y788F variant of β1was generated in a two-step polymerase chain reaction strategy. Overlapping fragments containing the desired amino acid substitution were first generated in two amplifications on wild type β1sequences using the oligonucleotide pairs: GGTGAAAATCCTATTTTTAAGAGTGCCG-GTAAGGTTCCTTCACAAAGAT and CGGCACTCTTAAAAATAGGATTTTCACC-ATACCTGCAACCGTTACTGCC. The amplified fragments were combined, denatured at 85°C for 10 min, and allowed to cool to room temp. The ends were then filled in with Sequenase (29Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and double-stranded fragments amplified with the oligonucleotides: GTAAGGTTCCTTCACAAAGAT and ATACCTGCAACCGTTACTGCC. Amplified products were digested with AflII and XhoI and inserted into the AflII- XhoI-digested β3β1chimera, thereby replacing wild type cytoplasmic sequences with the mutant sequence. The β3cytoplasmic variants F727A/F730L/E733V, Y747A, S752A, and Y759A were generated in a two-step polymerase chain reaction strategy as above for the β1variant Y788F. The final amplified product was digested with MluI and XhoI and then ligated into pCDM8. These constructs were then linearized with MluI and ligated to an MluI fragment from CD3a containing the remainder of β3coding sequences. The β3B construct was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification with the oligonucleotides: CGAAAAGAATTCGCTAAATTTGAGGAAGAACGCGCCAGAGCAAAATGGGACACCAGTAAGAGAC and AGAGTCCCCGGGTCAGACCAATGACTTTAGAAAACGCCCAGCCCCGTCTCTTACTGTGC. The amplified product was digested with EcoRI and SmaI and subcloned into CD3a cut with EcoRI and SmaI. Finally, this construct was linearized with EcoRI and ligated to an EcoRI fragment from β3containing its extracellular and transmembrane sequences. All constructs were identified by restriction digestion, purified by CsCl centrifugation, and verified by DNA sequencing before transfection. CHO( 1The abbreviations used are:CHOChinese hamster ovaryDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateLDLlow density lipoprotein. cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, BioWhittaker Inc., Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker Inc.), 1%L-glutamine (Sigma), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma), and 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma). Chinese hamster ovary Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fluorescein isothiocyanate low density lipoprotein. Integrin cDNA constructs were expressed in CHO cells by liposome-mediated transfection. Twenty-four hours before transfection, CHO cells were plated at a density of 106cells/100-cm dish. A total of 2 μg of each α and β construct and 20 μl of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in 180 μl of unsupplemented DMEM. Unsupplemented DMEM (3.8 ml) was then added and the DNA-liposome complexes overlaid onto the cells. The cells were incubated for 6 h at 37°C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated at 37°C with complete medium. Medium was changed after 24 h and the cells harvested and analyzed at 48 h. Transfectants were surface-labeled with 125I by the lactoperoxidase-glucose oxidase method (30Ginsberg M.H. Jaques B.C. Harker L. Zimmerman T.S. Methods in Hematology. Churchill Livingstone, New York1983: 158-176Google Scholar) and then solubilized in lysis buffer (10 m M Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.15 M NaCl, 50 m M octyl glucoside, 1 m M CaCl2, 1 m M MgCl2, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 m M leupeptin, and 10 m M N-ethylmaleimide). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated overnight with preimmune serum or with a polyclonal antiserum directed against β3and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 1 h at room temperature. The Sepharose beads were washed extensively in lysis buffer, resuspended in sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, immunoreactive proteins were resolved on non-reducing, 7.5% acrylamide gels, the gels dried, and bands visualized by autoradiography. Integrin affinity state was determined by a two color flow cytometry assay. Transient transfectants were harvested in Tyrode's buffer (31Ginsberg M.H. Taylor L. Painter R.G. Blood. 1980; 55: 661-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.1 mg/ml L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington) and 3.5 m M EDTA. After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, the cells were diluted with Tyrode's buffer containing 0.1% soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and 10% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), collected by centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 5 min, and washed once in Tyrode's buffer containing 10% bovine serum albumin. The cells were resuspended in Tyrode's and 5 × 105analyzed for PAC1 binding. Briefly, the cells were incubated in a final volume of 50 μl with a 1:25 dilution of PAC1 ascites in the presence or absence of 1 μM Ro43-5054. After 30 min at room temperature, the cells were diluted to 0.5 ml with Tyrode's buffer, pelletted, and resuspended in 50 μl of Tyrode's buffer containing a biotinylated, αIIbβ3-specific antibody, D57. After 30 min on ice, the cells were diluted to 0.5 ml with Tyrode's buffer, pelletted, and resuspended in 50 μl of Tyrode's buffer containing 4% phycoerythrin-conjugated strepavidin (Molecular Probes Inc., Junction City, OR) and 10% FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Tago, Burlingame, CA). After 30 min on ice, the samples were diluted to 0.5 ml with Tyrode's buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). PAC1 binding (FITC staining) was analyzed only on those gated cells positive for surface expression of αIIbβ3(phycoerythrin staining). Histograms of FITC staining in the presence or absence of a competitive inhibitor of PAC1 binding, Ro43-5054, were compared. High affinity integrins were identified by a rightward shift of the histogram in the absence of Ro43-5054. PAC1 binding was also analyzed after incubation with 6 μM anti-LIBS6. This antibody induces the high affinity state of αIIbβ3and reports optimum ligand binding (25Frelinger A.L. Du X. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Du X. Glass A.A. Ruggeri Z. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Cell Reg. 1990; 1: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As a quantitative measure of affinity state we have expressed the data as an activation index for each α,β pair. The activation index was defined as: 100 × (M - MR/ MA- MAR), where M = median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding, MR= median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of Ro43-5054, MA= median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of anti-LIBS6, and MAR= median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of anti-LIBS6 and Ro43-5054. To identify residues in β cytoplasmic domains that are involved in the regulation of integrin affinity states, we have generated point mutations in these sequences and coexpressed these variants in CHO cells with αIIbchimeras. These α subunit chimeras consist of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of αIIbjoined to the cytoplasmic sequences of α5, α6A, or α6B. In contrast to wild type αIIb, these α chimeras conferred an energy-dependent, constitutive high affinity state when coexpressed with constructs encoding the wild type β3or β1cytoplasmic domains (20O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Thus, the affinity state of the extracellular reporter group, αIIbβ3, was determined by the identity of its cytoplasmic sequences. Point mutations were first generated in the cytoplasmic sequences of β1(Fig. 1), a natural partner for the α5and α6cytoplasmic domains. Areas targeted included several hydroxylated residues which represent potential phosphorylation sites, the two NP XY internalization motifs, and residues in the putative α-actinin binding site. Many of these residues have also been implicated in the recruitment of β1to focal adhesions (28Reszka A.A. Yokichi Y. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1321-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These variant cytoplasmic sequences were first joined to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of β3generating β subunit chimeras. To determine if cytoplasmic mutations affected integrin expression, cells cotransfected with these β chimeras and αIIbα5(a chimera consisting of extracellular and transmembrane αIIbjoined to cytoplasmic α5) were analyzed for surface expression by flow cytometry. Constructs encoding the wild type and variant forms of the β1cytoplasmic domain demonstrated comparable levels of surface expression (Fig. 2, panels A, D, and G) when stained with an anti-αIIbβ3-specific monoclonal antibody. Indeed, all of the β1variants utilized in this study were well expressed. In addition, no differences between wild type or mutant β1expression were observed when cotransfection was with the α6A or α6B chimeras. Heterodimer formation and surface expression of β1variants was also confirmed by the immunoprecipitation of iodinated transfectants (data not shown). Thus, the β1point mutations we have examined do not disrupt normal subunit association or cell surface expression.FIG. 2Representative FACS histograms. Cells transfected with the α and β chimera listed on the left were stained and subjected to flow cytometry as described under “Materials and Methods.” Phycoerythrin staining, indicative of antibody D57 binding and integrin surface expression levels, is illustrated in panels A, D, and G. Note that each heterodimer was expressed at similar levels. Only those cells positive for surface expression (denoted in each histogram by M1) were gated and analyzed for FITC staining, indicative of PAC1 binding (panels B, C, E, F, H, and I). Histograms of PAC1 binding in the absence of inhibitor (solid line) were superimposed upon those analyzed in the presence of 1 μM Ro43-5054 (dotted line). A rightward shift is indicative of an active integrin. Histograms of PAC1 binding done in the presence of 6 μM anti-LIBS6 are shown in the last column (panels C, F, and I). All histograms represent an acquisition of 104events. Coexpression with the β3β1and β3β1Y788F constructs result in a constitutively active integrin (panels B and H), while expression of β3β1Y788A results in an inactive integrin (panel E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the functional effects of β1cytoplasmic mutation on ligand binding, transfectants were analyzed for their ability to bind PAC1 by flow cytometry (Fig. 2). Only those cells positive for surface expression (denoted by M1 in Fig. 2) were gated and analyzed for PAC1 binding. Like cells transfected with wild type β1(panel B), those expressing the Y788F variant bound PAC1 constitutively (panel H). Binding was specific since it could be blocked with a ligand-mimetic compound, Ro43-5054. In contrast, cells transfected with the Y788A variant failed to bind PAC1 (panel E). Binding in the latter case was observed only in the presence of an activating antibody, anti-LIBS 6. To numerically express PAC1 binding and affinity state, we have determined an activation index (AI) for each α,β combination as described under “Materials and Methods.” The AI values were determined for each of the β1tail variants when cotransfected with the αIIbα6Bchimera and compared to the wild type sequence (Fig. 3 A). When analyzed in this way, the group of β1variants fell into three functional categories: those that conferred near wild type levels (70-100%) of PAC1 binding (Y788F, Y800F), those that result in reduced (10-70%) binding (F771L, E774V, S790M, S790D, T793V/T794V, N797I, Y800A), and those that abolished (<10%) binding (N785I, Y788A, YTRF). To determine if these effects were specific for the α6Bcytoplasmic tail, the β1variants were also transfected with other α constructs. Similar effects on PAC1 binding were observed when coexpression was with αIIbchimeras containing the cytoplasmic sequences from the α5(Fig. 3 B) and α6A(data not shown) subunits. These results suggest that mutations at several sites within the β1cytoplasmic domain reduce energy-dependent ligand binding. The β1and β3cytoplasmic domains are approximately 60% identical and contain conservative amino acid substitutions at several other positions. This high degree of conservation suggests the possibility that analogous regions in both tails have functional importance. To look at this possibility, we have generated point mutations in the β3tail at sites corresponding to those residues in β1which affect its binding function (Fig. 1). Like those β1point mutations, cytoplasmic variants of β3do not disrupt normal patterns of α,β subunit association or cell surface expression (data not shown). With respect to functional properties, transfectants expressing a β3cytoplasmic truncation (Δ724) or the F727A/F730L/E733V, Y747A, and S752P, variants demonstrate a greatly reduced (<10%) ability to bind PAC1 when coexpressed with the αIIbα6Bchimera (Fig. 4 A). Although still reduced relative to wild type β3, the Y759A and S752A variants exhibit a somewhat greater AI. Similar effects on PAC1 binding were observed when these β3variants were coexpressed with the α5(Fig. 4 B) or α6A (data not shown) chimeras. Thus analogous residues in the β1and β3tails affect ligand binding affinity. Finally, we have generated a construct (β3B) encoding an alternately spliced form of the β3cytoplasmic domain (33van Kuppevelt T. Languino L.R. Gailit J.O. Suzuki S. Rouslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5415-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This variant eliminates 8 of 10 hydroxylated residues and the NP XY motifs in this tail. Coexpression of this construct with the constitutively active αIIbα6Bchimera also resulted in a low affinity receptor whose binding function was only elicited with anti-LIBS6 (Fig. 5).FIG. 5Alternately spliced β3 fails to bind PACl. The surface expression (panel A) and PAC1 binding properties (panels B and C) of transfectants expressing the αIIbα6B and β3B constructs were anlyzed by flow cytometry as described under “Materials and Methods.” Histograms of PACl binding done in the presence of the inhibitor Ro43-5054 are denoted by dotted lines. While cotransfection with the β3B construct does result in surface expression (panel A), PAC1 binding was only observed in cells stimulated with anti-LIBS6 (panel C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results described above: 1) identify a distinct set of β cytoplasmic residues required for inside-out signaling (Fig. 6), 2) define a functional role for the NP XY motif in this is process, 3) argue against the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of integrin tails is required, and 4) suggest cytoplasmic splice variants are not responsive to normal inside-out signaling mechansims. The most significant reductions in constitutive PAC1 binding were achieved by substitutions of the β1cytoplasmic residues Asn785 and Tyr788. These residues encompass an NPIY sequence of this domain, a conserved motif (NP XY) found in many β subunit cytoplasmic domains. Indeed, the β1(34Argraves S.W. Suzuki S. Arai H. Thompson K.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11009-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cytoplasmic sequences typically contain one of these motifs within 30 residues of the transmembrane domain (Fig. 6). In addition, the β1and β2tails also have a more distal NP XY/F sequence, while other β subunits contain a distal N XXY/F motif. The NP XY motif has been identified in the cytoplasmic sequences of several cell surface receptors (10Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It functions as an internalization sequence for the LDL receptor (10Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is essential for cellular transformation by the polyomavirus middle T antigen (40Druker B.J. Sibert L. Roberts T.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional studies suggest that the Asn and Pro residues of this motif are invariant. Substitution of either in the LDL receptor results in a significant reduction of coated pit-mediated endocytosis (10Chen W.-J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While internalization was maintained when the terminal Tyr of this motif was substituted with another aromatic residue (Phe, Trp), substitution with a non-aromatic residue resulted in decreased LDL receptor internalization (41Davis C.G. van Driel I.R. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4075-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These functional studies are similar to ours which demonstrated that substitution of Asn785 completely abolished PAC1 binding. Furthermore, we have observed a complete loss of PAC1 binding with the Y788A substitution but near wild type levels of binding with the more conservative Y788F variant. As predicted from these observations, we have determined that a β3cytoplasmic splice variant lacking the NP XY sequence is incapable of supporting constitutive PAC1 binding. Splice variants of β1lacking its NP XY motifs would also be predicted to be unresponsive to inside-out signaling mechanisms. A second internalization motif, originally identified in the transferrin receptor, is Y XRF (42Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A.

Cell. 1991; 67: 1195-1201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) suggest that both NP XY and YTRF form a reverse turn conformation. This conformation is hypothesized to present a recognition domain to adaptins in clathrin-coated pits thereby mediating uptake (43Bansal A. Gierasch L.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 1195-1201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Interestingly, peptides derived from receptors defective in endocytosis do not form the turn conformation. In our studies, the substitution of NPIY for YTRF in the β1tail completely abolished PAC1 binding. Since this substitution might not disrupt overall structure, the abolition of PAC1 binding is probably related to the loss of specific NPIY residues. It is conceivable that the NP XY motif could represent a recognition site for regulatory, intracellular moieties. Interestingly peptides spanning this region also inhibit talin-integrin interactions in vitro (44Tapley P. Horwitz A. Buck C. Duggan K. Rohrschneider L. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest a novel role for the membrane-proximal NP XY motif in the regulation of ligand binding. Meanwhile, the role of the NP XY motif in integrin internalization is ambiguous. Expression of a β2truncation that lacks its two NP XF motifs or an F-A substitution variant in the membrane-proximal NP XF both result in a loss of internalization (45Rabb H. Michishita M. Sharma C.P. Brown D. Arnaout M.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 990-1002PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, substitution of the tyrosines for serines in the two NP XY motifs of β1had no effect on α5β1internalization (46Vignoud L. Usson Y. Balzac F. Tarone G. Block M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Finally, the NP XY motifs of β3do not mediate internalization of αIIbβ3. 2J. Ylanne, J. Huuskonen, T. E. O'Toole, M. H. Ginsberg, I. Virtanen, and C. G. Gahmberg, manuscript in preparation. In contrast, amino acid substitutions within the distal NP XY motif of β1(N797I, Y800A, Y800F) had a lesser effect on receptor affinity. Similarly, a mutation in β3(Y759A) analogous to β1Y800A shows a reduced but variable ability to bind PAC1. Thus these residues do not seem to be nearly as crucial for the maintenance of high affinity binding as those in the first NP XY. Consistent with these results, this motif is not nearly as well conserved amongst β cytoplasmic sequences. As noted above, only β1and β2possess an exact distal NP XY/F sequence. While these sequences may play a minor role in the regulation of binding affinity, this motif in β2is required for cellular adhesion. Substitution of phenylalanine in the distal NP XF of this subunit abolished αLβ2-intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) interactions (5Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of integrin tails has been proposed to play a role in affinity modulation. In our studies, two variants which completely block PAC1 binding, β3S752P and β1Y788A, also represent potential phosphorylation sites. However, more conservative, yet phosphorylation-defective, substitutions at these residues (S752A and Y788F) results in greater or near wild type levels of PAC1 binding (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus the abolition of binding by S752P and Y788A is due to an effect other than on phosphorylation. Similarly, other β1(S790M, S790D, T793V/T794V, Y800A) and β3(Y747A, Y759A) variants, which eliminate potential phosphorylation sites, retain measurable levels of PAC1 binding. These results argue strongly against a role of phosphorylation in the enhancement of binding affinity and are consistent with others that discount a role for phosphorylation in promoting cellular adhesion (5Hibbs M.L. Jakes S. Stacker S.A. Wallace R.W. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1227-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 14Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25865-25875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is apparent that mutations at several sites within the β tail reduced or abolished PAC1 binding. In addition to those variants discussed above, β1(F771L, E774V) and β3(F727A/F730L/E733V) substitutions within the putative α-actinin binding site (7Otey C.A. Vasquez G.B. Burridge K. Erickson B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21193-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also reduced constitutive PAC1 binding. One explanation for these observations is that the dynamic regulation of ligand binding does involve many sites in the β tail. Alternatively, β tail folding and conformation may be extremely sensitive to amino acid substitution and it is these conformational changes which disrupt normal signaling pathways. It is also noteworthy that similar qualitative effects on PAC1 binding were observed whether the β1or β3point mutations were coexpressed with chimeras containing the α5, α6Aor α6Btails. It is possible that high affinity binding specified by these different α tails might involve a single regulatory pathway and thus the same β cytoplasmic sequence elements. Alternatively, each integrin may be independently regulated yet utilize the same β sequence elements. In this latter case integrin specific regulation would be mediated by sequences in the α chain. Distinguishing between these possibilities and identifying the mechanisms of cell-specific affinity modulation awaits further study. In summary, we have defined a subset of β cytoplasmic residues required for inside-out signaling. Substitutions within a membrane-proximal NP XY motif were the most effective in the abolition of binding, suggesting a novel function for this sequence. Defining the interaction of intracellular elements with these sequences will contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms of affinity modulation.

Microorganisms possess a variety of UV-protecting mechanisms, some of which (e.g. the SOS response) have been elucidated in great detail. Additionally, cells are equipped with radical quenchers and antioxidants that provide protection by scavenging harmful radicals or oxygen species. A variety of cells, including cyanobacteria, produce UV-absorbing substances that are thought to serve as sunscreen molecules (Garcia-Pichel and Castenholz, 1993Garcia-Pichel F. Castenholz R.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 163-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Karentz et al., 1991Karentz D. McEuen F.S. Land M.C. Dunlap W.C. Mar. Biol.

The occurrence of colorless UV-B-absorbing substances in cyanobacteria has been known for at least 25 years (Shibata, 1969Shibata K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1969; 10: 325-335Google Scholar). More recently, the induction of such compounds by UV-B was demonstrated (Garcia-Pichel et al., 1993Garcia-Pichel F. Wingard C.E. Castenholz R.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 170-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Scherer et al., 1988Scherer S. Chen T.W. Böger P. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. However, the structure of these cyanobacterial secondary products is not known. The terrestrial cyanobacterium Nostoc commune is well adapted to live under extraordinary environmental conditions. Besides withstanding extreme water stress (for review, see Potts, 1994Potts M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 755-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this organism can tolerate high levels of UV radiation. In this paper, the structure of a chromophore of a UV-B-absorbing pigment that is synthesized upon UV radiation is reported. 750-g fresh, wet colonies of N. commune var. Vaucher, collected after rains in South Germany during Spring 1992, were extracted in 2.5 liters of methanol:water (3:7) for 1.5 h at 40°C. After filtration and reduction of the volume to 0.1, the green filtrate was further purified by protein precipitation with chloroform. Additional proteins were removed by DE52 anion-exchange chromatography, and the flow-through fraction was eluted 2-fold from a gel exclusion chromatography column (Sephadex G-25; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). After concentration by freeze-drying, fractions were separated by reversed-phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are:HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPD-MSplasma desorption-mass spectrometryE312chromophore absorbing at 312 nmE335chromophore absorbing at 335 nm.

The use of other packing materials (RP-4, RP-8, NH2phase), buffers, ion-pairing reagents, and 0.1% (w/v) acetic acid failed to achieve better resolutions.

Pigments were treated with 2 M trifluoroacetic acid at 100°C for 3 h or with 6 M HCl at 100°C for 6 h. The solution was neutralized with solid NaHCO3. Hydrolyses were monitored after 1, 2, 3, 12, and 24 h by reversed-phase HPLC using the following gradient (RP-18 column): 0-5% acetonitrile in water from 0 to 30 min and 5-100% acetonitrile from 30 to 60 min. This gradient was also used for preparative separation of hydrolysis mixtures. TLC analysis of the hydrolyzed samples was performed according to Gauch et al., 1979Gauch R. Leuenberger U. Baumgartner E. J. Chromatogr. 1979; 174: 195-200Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar and Rebers et al., 1986Rebers P.A. Wessman G.E. Robyt J.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 153: 132-135Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar for amino sugars. HPLC analysis of the hydrolyzed samples was as described (Spiro and Spiro, 1992Spiro M.J. Spiro R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Glucose, galactose, mannose, rhamnose, fucose, xylose, ribose, arabinose, glucosamine, galactosamine, glucuronic acid, and galacturonic acid were used as reference substances. Samples were hydrolyzed in 1% (w/v) NH3or 12.5% (w/v) NH3at 25, 40, or 80°C. Alternatively, 6 M HCl at 110°C for 24 h under N2atmosphere with 0.1% (w/v) phenol was used. Amino acids were analyzed as o-phthalaldehyde derivatives on a 244-mm Supersphere column (E. Merck AG) using a Merck-Hitachi F1000 fluorescence detector. UV spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 5 UV-visible spectrometer. NMR spectra were recorded on an AC 250-MHz (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) or a JNM-GX 400-MHz (Jeol, Tokyo) spectrometer in D2O as solvent. The signals of the deuterated solvents were used as references. PD-MS spectra were recorded on a Bio Ion 20K spectrometer. 10-20 μg of the sample were loaded on a nitrocellulose-coated Mylar target. Fast atom bombardment-MS spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT 312/AMD-5000 spectrometer. Matrices were glycerin, 6 M HCl (1:1) or glycerol/thioglycerol/acetic acid (1:7:2). Starting from desiccated material, 10-15% of the total amount of pigment can be extracted in water at 25°C. Wet colonies do not release any pigments under these conditions. The isolation procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” yielded 7 mg of pigment/g of dry material with an absorption coefficient of 17 cm2mg−1 at 312 nm. Fig. 1 A shows the absorption spectrum of the pigment extract after 2-fold Sephadex column chromatography. This is by no means a pure preparation. It consists of a variety of compounds, each containing both chromophores in various ratios, which is indicated by the fractionation of the eluate by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 1 B). Every peak in the HPLC chromatogram absorbs at 312 and 335 nm and still is a mixture of compounds as shown by PD-MS (data not shown). Gel exclusion chromatography on Superose 12 with distilled water as eluent gave two peaks containing the pigment. The first one represented 85% of the absorption at 280 nm and showed an extremely high apparent molecular mass, eluting in the exclusion volume (≥2,000,000 Da). The smaller peak (15% of total absorption) was at an apparent molecular mass of 3200 Da. 0.2 M NaCl as eluent resulted in a single sharp peak with an apparent molecular mass of 3200 Da. The use of the chaotroph sodium trichloroacetate (1 M, pH 7.0) as eluent resolved a single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 2000 Da. A plasma desorption mass spectrum (Fig. 1 C) of the pigment in distilled water indicated a maximum molecular mass of 1801 Da. PD-MS normally yields no fragmentation ions with oligosaccharides. Therefore, it can be assumed that the largest pigment molecule has indeed a mass of 1801 Da. Starting from a molecular mass of 1646 Da, there are several peaks with a distance of Δm = 162, which would correlate with a homologous series of oligohexoses. Even after reversed-phase HPLC, the NMR spectra of the complex pigment mixture were far too complex for an interpretation. However, NMR spectra clearly demonstrated the presence of saccharide structures (data not shown). No cleavage of the pigment by applying 11 glycosidases separately as well as in combinations was obtained. Control experiments showed that the pigment mixture did not inhibit the enzymes used in these digestions (data not shown). After hydrolysis in the presence of 2 M trifluoroacetic acid, the anomeric protons of both glucose and galactose were detected in the NMR spectra of hydrolysis products of the pigment. Analysis of the saccharides by TLC and HPLC yielded glucose, galactose, and glucosamine. The product (named t38) of the trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis was purified by HPLC and subjected to a second hydrolysis under more vigorous conditions (6 M HCl, 6 h, 100°C). Thereafter, galactose, xylose, and glucuronic acid were detected by HPLC, which was confirmed by 13C NMR analysis of the hydrolysis product, t38 (Table I).Table I:13C NMR chemical shifts (solvent D2O, δ in ppm relative to Me2SO-d6, 39.50 ppm) for the carbon atoms of the saccharide part of t38 (containing E335) correlated with Me2SO-d6 literature data from Gorin and Mazurek, 1975Gorin P.A.J.

When hydrolysis was performed in 6 M HCl for 24 h, the following amino acids were found in amounts equivalent to one-tenth of the molar amount of pigment (assuming an average molecular mass of the pigment of 1200 Da): Asx, Glx, Ser, Gly, Thr, and Ala. The most conspicuous feature of the two chromophores, besides the absorption maxima, is their complementary stability against acids and bases. The actions of acids or bases are irreversible processes; no isosbestic points are found. E312 is destroyed at pH 2 at 25°C within minutes. E335 is stable for hours in 2 M trifluoroacetic acid at 100°C, but is destroyed at pH values higher than 12. Chemical hydrolysis in the presence of 2 M trifluoroacetic acid at 100°C for 3 h produced a definitively less polar product on reversed-phase HPLC (t38) (Fig. 2). This fragment had only one absorption maximum at 335 nm. Apparently, the 312 nm chromophore was destroyed. After preparative HPLC purification, subsequent HPLC analysis showed a single peak in the chromatogram, designated t38. Nevertheless, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry revealed that this fraction still is a mixture of several compounds (data not shown). The highest molecular mass was 703 Da (MH+; MNa+ 725 was also found). The 1H NMR data showed the presence of methoxy, hydroxymethyl, and cyclic methylene protons. 13C NMR data of the chromophore based on hydrolysis of HPLC-purified t38 are listed in Table II.Table II:13C NMR chemical shifts (solvent D2O, δ in ppm relative to Me2SO-d6, 39.50 ppm) for the 335 nm chromophore compared with literature data from Takano et al., 1979Takano S.

Nakanishi A. Uemura D. Hirata Y. Chemistry Letters. 1979; : 419-420Crossref Google Scholar). All NMR signals for the 1,3-diamino-2-methoxycyclohexen core are found in the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of t38, which contains E335 (Table II). A characteristic feature of the Nostoc pigments is the complementary sensitivity of the two chromophores to acids and bases, which is also a feature of mycosporines (Takano et al., 1978Takano S. Uemura D. Hirata Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1978; : 4909-4912Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar; Chioccara et al., 1980Chioccara F. Dela Gala A. De Rosa M. Novellino E. Prota G. Bull. Soc. Chim. Belg. 1980; 89: 1101-1106Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The E312 chromophore has UV spectroscopic and hydrolysis properties identical to those of mycosporine-Gly (Ito and Hirata, 1977Ito S. Hirata Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1977; : 2429-2430Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a 3-aminocyclohexene-1-one derivative with only 1 amino acid that is readily hydrolyzed by hot water. The product formed by hydrolysis is an unstable 1,3-diketone with an absorption maximum at 268 nm in acidic solution (Ito and Hirata, 1977Ito S. Hirata Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1977; : 2429-2430Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar; Plack et al., 1981Plack P.A. Fraser N.W. Grant P.T. Middleton C. Mitchell A.I. Thomson R.H. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the Nostoc pigment E312 showed a similar transient absorption. Therefore, we suggest tentatively that the chromophore core of E312 might also be a mycosporine, although we do not have NMR data available to support this assertion. The complex pigment mixture contains glucose, galactose, glucosamine, glucuronic acid, and xylose in unknown molarities. It may be significant that a water stress protein of N. commune (Scherer and Potts, 1989Scherer S. Potts M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12546-12553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is secreted and is associated with the UV-absorbing pigments and a xylanxylanohydrolase activity (Hill et al., 1994Hill D.R. Hladun S.L. Scherer S. Potts M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7726-7734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Usually, oligosaccharides are hydrolyzed in 2 M HCl at 100°C. E335 is stable under these conditions, and only part of the saccharides are liberated from the pigment. Based on 13C NMR data, unhydrolyzable C-glycosides as structural elements could be excluded: signals between 85 and 100 ppm (cf. Table I), typical for C-glycosides, are missing. For the same reason, N-glycosides can be ruled out (Dill et al., 1985Dill K. Berman E. Pavia A.A. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1985; 43: 1-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Some other unusually stable glycosidic bonds are known that contain an amino function near the glycosidic bond (Foster et al., 1957Foster A.B. Horton D. Stacey M. J. Chem. Soc. 1957; : 81-86Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Protonation of nitrogen prevents the attack of a proton at the glycosidic oxygen atom and thereby hydrolysis. As mycosporines are substituted with amino acids or amino alcohols, such structures are probably the cause for the unusual stability of the glycosidic bonds in the Nostoc pigment. This is consistent with our finding that glycosidases are unable to liberate saccharides from the pigment. Amino acids can be liberated from most of the mycosporines by very dilute base (Takano et al., 1978Takano S. Uemura D. Hirata Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1978; : 4909-4912Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or even hot water (mycosporine-Gly) (Ito and Hirata, 1977Ito S. Hirata Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1977; : 2429-2430Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We could not detect any amino acids after such hydrolysis procedures. As acetals, glycosides are stable under basic conditions. Therefore, if the amino acid is linked to an oligosaccharide, this oligosaccharide-amino acid conjugate cannot be detected by amino acid analysis. O-Glycosides of Ser and Thr give β-eliminination under basic conditions, resulting in α-aminoacrylic acid derivatives (Wakabayashi and Pigman, 1974Wakabayashi K. Pigman W. Carbohydr. Res. 1974; 35: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which also cannot be detected by normal amino acid analysis. However, after treatment with 6 M HCl at 110°C, we found the amino acids Asx, Glx, Ser, Thr, Gly, and Ala. Ala and Asx have not yet been reported as components of mycosporine amino acids. Based on the data presented, we suggest the structure of E335 that is depicted in Fig. 3. The chromophore of the pigment is a mycosporine with 2 amino acid residues. Saccharides such as galactose, xylose, and glucuronic acid are coupled to these amino acid residues, forming a stable “inner shell” of saccharides that is only hydrolyzable under vigorous conditions. An “outer shell” of glucose, galactose, and glucosamine is attached that is easily hydrolyzable. Based on PD-MS, a molecular mass of 1801 Da for the the largest pigment molecule was found, which corresponds well with our results from gel exclusion chromatography. One mycosporine chromophore with Thr and Ser as substituents plus two inner shell saccharides (Gal) attached would have a molecular mass of 701 Da. The largest pigment molecule with a molecular mass of 1801 Da could therefore be composed of up to eight oligosaccharides. Most probably, the UV-B-absorbing pigments in the glycan sheath of N. commune are a complex mixture of molecules of different sizes and amino acid and saccharide composition. Among the mycosporines described in this paper are some with an unusually high molecular mass and the first ones to be described that have oligosaccharides attached. Our data show that the pigments form large complexes in aqueous solutions that are held together by noncovalent interactions (compare with data of Fransson et al., 1984Fransson L.-Å. Cöster L. Nieduszynski I.A. Phelps C.F. Sheehan J.K. Arnott S. Rees D.A. Morris E.R. Molecular Biophysics of the Extracellular Matrix. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1984: 95-118Crossref Google Scholar). The extraordinary high molecular mass complexes observed during gel exclusion chromatography may well be due to the ability of the pigment to associate tightly with the extracellular polysaccharide sheath of Nostoc by noncovalent interaction with the glycan sheath, preventing its loss during drying and rewetting cycles of the colonies occurring daily in some habitats (Scherer and Zhong, 1991Scherer S. Zhong Z.P. Microb. Ecol. 1991; 22: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). There is clear evidence that the Nostoc pigments serve as a sunscreen. First, the pigments are inducible by UV-B (Scherer et al., 1988Scherer S. Chen T.W. Böger P. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1055-1057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the UV-absorbing pigment is located extracellularly in the glycan sheath of the colony; during extraction of the material under mild conditions, no intracellular compounds were detected in the extract, which is indicated by the complete lack of phycobiliproteins in the aqueous extracts (see also Hill et al., 1994Hill D.R. Hladun S.L. Scherer S. Potts M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7726-7734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the actual contribution of the mycosporines to UV-B absorption is significant. On the average, wet N. commune colonies collected in the field are 0.5 mm thick and contain 40 μg of UV-B-absorbing pigment/cm2. The pigment has an average ϵ of 17 cm2mg−1. If the pigments are distributed homogeneously throughout the glycan sheath, an average sunscreen factor of 0.7 can be calculated (compare with data of Garcia-Pichel and Castenholz, 1993Garcia-Pichel F. Castenholz R.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 163-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This means that two out of three photons will be absorbed by the UV-absorbing pigment. We thank M. Potts for helpful discussions and F. Garcia-Pichel for donation of reference samples."

Four nitric oxide (NO)-carrying proteins have been isolated from salivary glands of the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus.

For hematophagous arthropods, feeding success is enhanced by a variety of salivary factors that counter the host's hemostatic responses (1Ribeiro J.M.C. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1987; 32: 463-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Rhodnius prolixus, a principal vector of Chaga's disease, has a salivary vasodilator that has been shown to have properties similar to nitrovasodilators, pharmacological agents which release nitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are:NOnitric oxidebpbase pair(s)HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPCRpolymerase chain reactionSGsalivary glands. (2Ribeiro J.M.C. Marinotti O. Gonzales R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 101: 932-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On molecular sieving columns, the vasodilatory activity was associated with abundant heme proteins, which give Rhodnius salivary glands (SG) their characteristic cherry red color. Subsequently, it was shown that the heme protein fraction of the SG homogenate reversibly binds NO, and the proportion of protein with ligated NO correlates with the vasodilatory activity (3Ribeiro J.M.C. Hazzard J.M. Nussenzveig R.H. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Science. 1993; 260: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The reversible binding of NO was attributed to the interaction of NO with an Fe(III) heme. Further, NO was rapidly released at high pH and was retained at low pH, with a pKa of 6.5, suggesting an interaction of histidine with the heme (3Ribeiro J.M.C. Hazzard J.M. Nussenzveig R.H.

In the present study, we have investigated further the nature of this unique NO storage and transport system. nitric oxide base pair(s) high pressure liquid chromatography polymerase chain reaction salivary glands. Salivary glands (240 pairs) were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (150 m M NaCl, pH 7.5), transferred to 100 μl of 25 m M triethanolamine HCl pH 8.4, homogenized in a Potter homogenizer, and centrifuged; the supernatant (diluted to 500 μl) was then chromatofocused on a Mono-P fast protein liquid chromatography column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) developed from pH 8.4 to 7.0 with Polybuffer HCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Elution was monitored at 280 nm for total proteins and 422 nm for heme proteins. The HPLC system consisted of a LDC constaMetric 4100 pump, a Milton Roy SM4000 detector, and a Milton Roy CI-10B integrator interfaced with an IBM PC. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals. The pH gradient was also monitored by determining the pH of every fifth fraction with a Beckman pH meter. Heme protein fractions were further purified by HPLC on a Macrosphere SCX 300-micron-strong cation exchange column (Alltech Associates Inc., Deerfield, IL), using a 60-min gradient of 0-1 M NaCl, 25 m M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 0.5 ml/min. Proteins were assayed for purity using reversed-phase HPLC. Aliquots were chromatographed on a Macrosphere 300 C18 5-micron column (Alltech), using a gradient of 20-60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid developed over 50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The HPLC was as above, except for a Milton Roy CM4000 pump. Elution was monitored at 220 nm. The molecular weight of the purified proteins was determined by laser desorption mass spectroscopy. Purified heme proteins in 150 m M NaCl, 10 m M sodium phosphate pH 7.2 buffer were deoxygenated by blowing water-saturated argon across the surface of the solution in a gas-tight cuvette for 2 h. Residual oxygen was removed from the argon by passing the gas through a column of Rydox (Sigma). Nitric oxide-saturated water was produced by deoxygenating water (4 ml) with argon (2 h), then bubbling nitric oxide for 1 min, followed by 2 min of argon flushing to the head space to remove undissolved NO. Nitric acid and anhydrides were removed from the NO by passing the gas over KOH. Proteins were ligated with NO by adding NO-saturated H2O in 1-μl increments until the Soret band had shifted to 422 nm. Spectra were recorded from 250 to 700 nm on a Perkin Elmer λ-19 spectrophotometer. The heme groups of all four proteins were characterized by the pyridine-hemochromogen method (4Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers of Biology. Vol 21. American Elsevier Publishing Co., Inc., New York1971Google Scholar). A dilute solution of the protein (70 μl) was combined with 30 μl of pyridine, 2 μl of 5 N KOH, and crystals of dithionite. After mixing, 60 μl were transferred to a 1-cm path length cuvette, and three spectra were taken from 700 to 540 nm at 1-min intervals. The peak absorbance at 556 nm minus the absorbance at 700 nm was used to determine the hemin concentration, assuming an extinction coefficient of 32 m M−1 cm−1 (4Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers of Biology. Vol 21. American Elsevier Publishing Co., Inc., New York1971Google Scholar). The ratio of heme to protein was determined using protein concentrations determined by duplicate amino acid analyses. As this procedure underestimates protein concentrations due to hydrolysis of some residues, a correction factor of 1.302 was derived by determining the concentration of a sample of the heme protein myoglobin spectroscopically (4Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers of Biology. Vol 21. American Elsevier Publishing Co., Inc., New York1971Google Scholar) and by amino acid analysis. This correction factor was applied to estimate actual nitrophorin concentrations. An aliquot of the most abundant protein, NP1 (1.25 nmol = 25 μg), was dissolved in 50 μl of 8 M urea, 0.4 M NH4acetate reduced with 5 μl of 45 m M dithiothreitol for 15 min at 50°C, then carboxyamidomethylated with 5 μl of 100 m M iodoacetamide at room temperature for 15 min (5Stone K.L. LoPresti M.B. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1989: 31-47Google Scholar). After dilution to 200 μl with H2O, 1 μg of trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim) was added, and the solution was incubated at 37°C overnight. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC as described above for the purified heme proteins, except that the gradient was developed over 70 min. The amino acid composition of duplicate 40-pmol aliquots of the four proteins was determined on a Beckman 7300 amino acid analyzer using the post-column ninhydrin ion-exchange method. The amino-terminal sequences of all heme proteins (1 nmol each) were determined using an ABI 477A pulsed-liquid sequencer. Two peptides from the tryptic digest of NP1 were also sequenced. Amino acid analysis and Edman degradation were carried out by the University of Arizona Macromolecular Structure Facility. A 96-fold degenerate oligonucleotide primer was designed based on amino acid residues 12-19 of the amino-terminal sequence of NP1. A second degenerate primer was based on one of the peptides isolated from the tryptic digest. mRNA was isolated from 40 SG pairs and reverse transcribed into cDNA using Superscript (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the primer 5′-GGGGAGGCTCGAGTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′. First-strand cDNA was amplified in a PCR experiment using the above primers, with annealing at 55°C, extension at 72°C, and denaturing at 94°C, for 1 min each in a Coy model 60 temp cycler. The reaction mix included 2.5 m M MgCl2, 50 m M KCl, 10 m M Tris, pH 8.3, 0.01% gelatin, 0.2 m M of each dNTP, and 1.25 units of Ampli- Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). PCR products were gel purified (Sephaglas BandPrep kit, Pharmacia) and cloned into the pCR II vector (TA Cloning, Invitrogen) for dideoxy sequencing with Sequenase II (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Messenger RNA was isolated (Micro Fast-Track kit, Promega) from Rhodnius salivary glands taken at 2, 4, and 7 days after a blood meal (50 pairs each), at 14 days (250 pairs), and at 17 days (100 pairs). Total yield was 16 μg of mRNA, of which 5 μg were used to construct a cDNA library in λZAP (Stratagene). The unamplified library had a complexity of 1.38 × 106recombinants. A total of 15 × 103recombinants (from the unamplified library) were screened with a 32P-labeled probe made (using the Prime-It II kit, Stratagene) from a 120-bp PCR-generated fragment of NP1. Positive plaques were purified with a secondary screening and rescued in pBluescript (Stratagene). Plasmids were isolated using the Magic Mini-Prep kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced manually using Sequenase II or cycle sequenced at the University of Georgia Molecular Instrumentation facility. Two clones were sequenced in both directions. Chromatofocusing of 240 pairs of Rhodnius salivary glands yielded four major heme proteins, identified by their absorption at both 422 and 280 nm (Fig. 1). We propose the name “nitrophorins” for these proteins, to reflect their NO-transporting function, and designate the four proteins as NP1-NP4 as indicated in Fig. 1. Each of the four appeared to be double peaks, with the components separated by 0.03-0.06 pH units. Initially, it was thought that each component of the double peaks was a separate protein, but subsequent strong cation exchange chromatography (Fig. 2) and reversed-phase chromatography (not shown) indicated that the early- and late-eluting components of each peak were identical. The same result was obtained with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown), and pooled early and late peaks gave a single amino-terminal sequence. The peak splitting is attributed to the presence of a mixture of NO-bound and unligated protein. The unligated proteins had pI values of 7.97, 7.53, 6.94, and 7.75 for NP1 to NP4, respectively. Laser desorption mass spectrometry gave masses of 20,378 for NP1, 19,689 for NP2, 19,718 for NP3, and 20,914 for NP4 (Table I). Spectral characteristics of the four proteins are also reported in Table I.FIG. 2Heme proteins from the chromatofocusing column were further purified using a strong cation exchange column with a mobile phase of 0-1 M NaCl, 25 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table I:Physical properties of nitrophorins from R. prolixus salivary glandsTable I:Physical properties of nitrophorins from R. prolixus salivary glands The pyridine-hemochromogen spectra of NP1-NP3 show a peak at 556 nm, consistent with identification of the heme group as protoporphyrin IX (4Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers of Biology. Vol 21. American Elsevier Publishing Co., Inc., New York1971Google Scholar). The spectrum of NP4 has a peak at 556 nm and a shoulder at 580-595 nm, indicating the presence of other pigments in addition to hemin. The molar ratio of heme to protein is close to 1 for each of the proteins (Table I). The total of the three proteins, 325 pmol/gland pair, is close to the estimated content of 282 pmol NO per SG pair (3Ribeiro J.M.C. Hazzard J.M. Nussenzveig R.H. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Science. 1993; 260: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), which is also consistent with a single NO binding site per protein molecule. At pH 7.2, all four nitrophorins bind NO, indicated by a shift in the Soret band. The Soret shifts from 404 to 422 nm for NP1, NP2, and NP3; ligated NP4 has a Soret maximum at 417.9 nm (Fig. 3). The direction of the shift indicates that all four nitrophorins bind NO with an iron III heme group, as was previously found for whole salivary gland homogenates (3Ribeiro J.M.C. Hazzard J.M. Nussenzveig R.H. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Science. 1993; 260: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Further, the α and β bands of the spectrum intensify on NO binding, indicating a transition from high to low spin (4Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Frontiers of Biology. Vol 21. American Elsevier Publishing Co., Inc., New York1971Google Scholar). All four nitrophorins release NO on dilution or with equilibriation with argon; the kinetics of NO binding and release will be reported elsewhere. Amino acid analysis indicates that NP1 is most similar to NP4, and NP2 is most similar to NP3 (Table II). All four proteins contain an unusually high amount of tyrosine, 13 residues in the case of NP1. NP1 differs from NP4 only in a higher content of (Asn + Asp) and lower amounts of serine and glycine. NP2 appears to differ from NP3 in a higher content of (Gln + Glu), tyrosine, leucine, and lysine and a lower content of serine, glycine, and proline. The amino-terminal sequences also suggest the relationship of NP1 to NP4 and NP2 to NP3 (Fig. 4). NP1 and NP4 differ at only 2 of the first 15 residues, with substitutions of alanine for lysine in position 1 and isoleucine for leucine in position 7. NP2 and NP3 differ by only 1 of the first 20 residues. In contrast, NP1 and NP2 have only 8 of the first 20 residues in common. A blank cycle in position 2 of all four proteins was presumed to indicate cysteine, an assignment which is supported by the cDNA sequence of NP1 given below.Table II:Amino acid composition (as number of residues) of NP1-NP4Values shown are based on between 2 and 6 analyses for each protein. The predicted amino acid composition of the NP1 clone is also shown.FIG. 4Amino-terminal sequence ofnitrophorins 1-4. Sequence was derived by Edman degradation of 1,000 pmol of each protein. Substitutions requiring a single nucleotide base change are indicated by a dot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Values shown are based on between 2 and 6 analyses for each protein. The predicted amino acid composition of the NP1 clone is also shown. Messenger RNA was isolated from 40 R. prolixus SG pairs, reverse transcribed into single-stranded cDNA, and used in a PCR experiment with degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on the partial amino acid sequences obtained from Edman analysis. A single band of 120 bp was produced. This product was purified by gel electrophoresis and cloned into the pCRII vector. Three transformed clones were sequenced in both directions; all three coded for NP1, based on amino acid sequence identity with residues 20-44 of the amino-terminal sequence. Two discrepancies with the Edman-derived sequence were readily resolved. One involved the misidentification of Tyr, tailing from the previous cycle, in a blank cycle produced by a cysteine in position 41. In position 39, the tailing Lys peak from the previous cycle was chosen over the Arg peak. An aliquot of 15,000 recombinants was screened with the 120-bp NP1 PCR product; 132 positives were detected, and 15 were picked for a secondary screening. This indicates that about 0.9% of the mRNA in Rhodnius salivary glands codes for NP1. Ten plaque-purified clones were rescued in pBluescript. Restriction digestion of the resultant plasmids indicated that nine of these had inserts of about 900 bp, and one had a 700-bp insert. Two clones with the larger insert were completely sequenced in both directions. Both clones were identical and were consistent with the amino acid sequence derived from amino-terminal sequencing of NP1. The complete sequence of the NP1 clone is given in Fig. 5. As is typical for a secreted protein, there is a signal peptide sequence of 23 residues, 14 of which are hydrophobic. The mature protein (without the signal peptide) is 184 residues long and has a predicted mass of 20,482, within experimental error of the mass of NP1 (20, 378) determined by laser desorption mass spectroscopy. Although a single potential glycosylation site (6Wieland F.T. Gleason M.L. Serafini T.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 289-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) is present at residue 147, mass spectrometry indicates NP1 is not glycosylated. The predicted pI of the clone (7.25) is lower than the observed pI of the native protein, but the pI would be expected to be altered by the presence of a heme group and secondary structure. The predicted amino acid composition of the NP1 clone compares well with the composition of the native protein (Table II); the only discrepancy was a greater than expected number of cysteines, but cysteines are typically underrepresented in amino acid analysis. Data base searches found no similarity between the sequence of nitrophorin 1 and other proteins. However, the non-covalently bound protoporphyrin IX heme, the size of the protein, and the interaction of a histidine with the heme (indicated by the pH dependence of NO binding and the EPR spectrum of salivary homogenates) (3Ribeiro J.M.C. Hazzard J.M. Nussenzveig R.H. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Science. 1993; 260: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) suggests a possible relationship to hemoglobins or b cytochromes.

Evol. 1984; 2: 33-41Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) indicates an overall sequence similarity of 38-45%, but no pronounced regions of sequence identity were seen. However, the same result is produced by aligning sequences of various invertebrate and vertebrate hemoglobins, a consequence of the extreme sequence variability of this group of proteins (13Dickerson R.E. Geis I. Hemoglobin. Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1983Google Scholar, 14Vinogradov S.N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1985; 82: 1-15Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Riggs A.F. Am. Zool. 1991; 31: 535-545Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Predictions of secondary structure, generated using the PeptideStructure program of the GCG sequence analysis software package (16Jameson W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1988; 4: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar), also indicate little correspondence between NP1 and hemoglobins, but again the same result is obtained when, for example, Chironomus chain III hemoglobin is compared with human β chain hemoglobin. If the Rhodnius salivary heme proteins are in fact derived from invertebrate hemoglobin, they conform to the pattern of insect hemoglobins in being single domain, single subunit molecules with a single heme binding site (14Vinogradov S.N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1985; 82: 1-15Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Evidence from EPR spectroscopy and the pKa of NO release suggest that the imidazole of a histidine interacts with the heme (3Ribeiro J.M.C. Hazzard J.M. Nussenzveig R.H. Champagne D.E. Walker F.A. Science. 1993; 260: 539-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The NP1 clones encode three histidines in positions 59, 120, and 124. Many hemoglobins from vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants contain a pair of histidines, separated by 2-6 amino acids, located in positions 118-125; usually, the histidine closer to the amino-terminal end is the proximal ligand that interacts with the heme (12Runnegar B. J. Mol. Evol. 1984; 2: 33-41Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In most hemoglobins and cytochromes, a third histidine, located 28-35 residues to the amino-terminal end from the proximal histidine, forms the distal ligand to the heme (12Runnegar B. J. Mol. Evol. 1984; 2: 33-41Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar); in invertebrate hemoglobins, this histidine is often replaced with valine, leucine, or glutamine (14Vinogradov S.N. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1985; 82: 1-15Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Riggs A.F. Am. Zool. 1991; 31: 535-545Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The highly conserved CD1 phenylalanine, located 13-21 residues before the distal histidine, is required to anchor the heme in the heme pocket (12Runnegar B. J. Mol. Evol. 1984; 2: 33-41Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Alignment of NP1 with hemoglobin sequences suggests that the histidine at position 120 may form the proximal ligand; if so, the distal ligand may be replaced with a valine in position 89, and the conserved phenylalanine may be represented in position 68. The interaction of these residues with the heme will have to be confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. The similar amino-terminal sequence and amino acid composition of NP1 and NP4 suggest that these proteins are closely related and may even be allelic variants. NP2 and NP3 are also similar to one another, although they differ more in amino acid composition. The significance of multiple nitrophorins is unclear, but the four proteins differ from one another in their NO binding and release kinetics, 2D. E. Champagne, R. Nussenzveig, and J. M. C. Ribeiro, unpublished results. and, in combination, they may deliver NO to a greater length of the blood vessel. The presence of pigments other than hemin associated with NP4 suggests that this protein may help scavenge degraded hemin, which could result from reaction with NO. Given the unique nature of these NO storage and transport proteins and the varied roles of NO in biological systems (17Traylor T.G. Sharma V.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2847-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), their continued study is certain to prove of interest."

PA can also be metabolized to diacyglycerol, which in turn stimulates protein kinase C. A unique property of PLD is its catalysis of the transphosphatidylation reaction in which the phosphatidyl moeity of phospholipids is accepted by a primary alcohol (12Dawson R.M.C. Biochem.

In HL60 cells, PLD activity was reported in membranes and shown to be regulated by GTPγS in the presence of a cytosolic factor (21Anthes J.C. Wang P. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. Biochim.

This 21-kDa protein was first identified and purified on the basis of its activity as a cofactor for cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation of the α-subunit of Gs(28Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6228-6234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study has also suggested the involvement of a membrane-associated G protein of the Rho family in PLD regulation (27Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that GTP-dependent PLD activity in HL60 cell preparations was stimulated by a nonspecific GDP dissociation stimulator and inhibited by a Rho-specific GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI). The present investigation of PLD activity in HL60 cells has revealed the presence of PLD in cytosol as well as membranes. In addition, it has been found that the membrane-bound PLD can be stimulated by GTPγS in the absence of cytosol, and evidence is presented that the G protein involved is RhoA. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dipalmitoyl-PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), PA, and phosphatidylethanol (PEth) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Corp. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and GTPγS were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. [9,10-3H]Myristic acid, dipalmitoyl [2- palmitoyl-9,10-3H]phosphatidylcholine, and dipalmitoylphosphatidyl[methyl-3H]choline were from DuPont NEN. HL60 cells were obtained from ATCC. DEAE Sephacel and Superdex 200 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Hydroxylapatite was from CalBiochem. The cDNAs of Rac1 and Rho A (gifts of A. Hall, University College, London) and of CDC42 (a gift of S. Munemitsu, Onxy Pharmaceuticals) were provided with a modified Glu-Glu epitope tag at the N terminus, cloned into pAcC13, and transfected into Sf9 cells to produce recombinant baculovirus, and the proteins were purified on a Glu-Glu monoclonal antibody affinity column as described by Malcolm et al. (30Malcolm K.C. Ross A.H. Qui R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25951-25954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the proteins were prepared from Sf9 cytosol, it is likely that they were partly modified by prenylation. Soluble ADP ribosylation factor (sARF) (a mixture of ARF1 and ARF3) was purified from bovine or rat brain cytosol (31Moss J. Tsai S.-C. Price C.R. Bobak D.A. Vaughan M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against sARF according to Tsai et al. (32Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Williamson K. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107 (abstr.): 4017Google Scholar). Both were kind gifts of S.-C. Tsai and J. Moss (National Institutes of Health). Antibodies against C-terminal peptides of RhoA, RhoB, Rac1, and Rac2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Corporation. Glutathione S-transferase-fused Rho-specific GDP dissociation inhibitor (GST-Rho-GDI) was purified from E. coli transformed with the relevant plasmid (30Malcolm K.C. Ross A.H. Qui R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25951-25954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid and antiserum against CDC42Hs were gifts from Y. Zheng and R. Cerione (Cornell University). HL60 cells were maintained in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium (Cell Gro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% air. Cells were harvested when confluent (1 × 106cells/ml). Cells were labeled with [3H]myristic acid, and membranes were prepared as described (21Anthes J.C. Wang P. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Membranes were aliquoted (0.5-1.0 mg protein/ml) and stored at −80°C. Harvested HL60 cells (4-6 × 109) were washed twice in buffer. A (25 m M HEPES (pH 7.2), 125 m M NaCl, 2.5 m M KC1, 0.7 m M MgCl, 0.5 m M EGTA, 10 m M glucose). Washed cells were resuspended in buffer B (5 m M HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 m M EGTA, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 250 m M sucrose, 12 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml antipain) and were disrupted in a bomb by rapid decompression after equilibration with N2at 4°C for 20 min at 500 psi. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. Membranes and cytosol were obtained by centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 90 min. Supernatant (cytosol) was used for chromatography, whereas the pellet (membranes) was washed twice in buffer C (50 m M HEPES (pH 7.2), 10 m M KCl, 5 m M NaCl, 0.5 m M EGTA, and 3.5 m M MgCl2). Membranes were aliquoted (5-10 mg/ml) and stored at −80°C. 150 ml of cytosol (1 mg of protein/ml) was loaded on a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 12 cm). The column was washed with buffer D (25 m M HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 m M EGTA, and 1 m M dithiothreitol), and the bound proteins were eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.8 M) in buffer D. Fractions (3 ml) were assayed for PLD activity, and active fractions were pooled and used for further purification and characterization of PLD. For gel filtration chromatography, the pool of active fractions was concentrated to 3 ml using a YM10 Amicon membrane and applied to a 150-ml Superdex 200 column in buffer A. This was eluted with the same buffer. Column fractions (2 ml) were assayed for PLD activity in the presence and absence of bovine sARF. Alternatively, a pool of active DEAE fractions (from another cytosol preparation) was diluted with buffer D (without EGTA) to decrease the concentration of NaCl to 50 m M. The diluted pool was then loaded onto a 10-ml hydroxyapatite column. The column was extensively washed with buffer E (25 m M HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 m M dithiothreitol, and 50 m M NaCl), and the adsorbed material was eluted with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate (0-150 m M) in buffer E. Fractions (1 ml) were assayed for PLD activity in presence and absence of sARF. [3H]Myristic acid-labeled HL60 membranes were assayed for PLD activity as described (21Anthes J.C. Wang P. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PLD activity was measured in unlabeled membranes, cytosol, and column fractions, using phospholipid (PE/PIP2/PC, 16:1.4:1) vesicles prepared according to Brown et al. (25Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Dipalmitoyl[2- palmitoyl-9-10-3H]PC (0.5 μCi) (for [3H]PEth formation) or dipalmitoyl[methyl-3H]choline PC (0.5 μCi) (for [3H]choline release) was included in the phospholipid mixture for each assay. For a 60-μl assay volume, 10 μl of vesicles were added to the assay buffer (50 m M HEPES, (pH 7.2), 3 m M EGTA, 80 m M KCl, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 3 m M MgCl2, and 2 m M CaCl2) containing membranes, cytosol, or column fractions and were incubated at 37°C for 30 min (unless otherwise indicated). For the [3H]choline release assay, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 200 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 100 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin, and the mixtures were processed as described (25Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). For [3H]PEth formation, ethanol (1% (v/v) for membranes or 2% (v/v) for cytosol and column fractions) was included in the reaction mixtures, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of 375 μl of chloroform/methanol/HC1 (50:98:2), and the lipids were extracted as described (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 11-17Crossref Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). Lipids from the incubation mixtures were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1) and spotted onto thin layer plates (LK6D, Silica gel, Whatman). The plates were developed with ethyl acetate/isooctane/acetic acid/water (50:25:10:50, modified from Ref. 34Pai J.K. Siegel M. Billah M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This solvent system gives better separation of PA and PEth. Separated phospholipids and standards were visualized on thin-layer chromatography plates by exposure to iodine vapor. Spots corresponding to PA and PEth were scraped, mixed with ready organic scintillant (Beckman), and counted. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 14% acrylamide gels or gradient 10-25% acrylamide Novex gels (Novel Experimental Corp.). For Western analysis, proteins were transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gels onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore) for 1 h at 15 V using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The immunoblots were blocked overnight with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 1% (v/v) goat serum and incubated for 2 h with primary antibody in blocking buffer. Blots were developed using the Vector stain alkaline phosphatase ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). HL60 membranes were incubated with GST-Rho-GDI in buffer F (20 m M HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 m M glutathione) at 4°C for 60 min. After incubation, membranes were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were collected, and membranes were washed twice in solution A. For controls, membranes were incubated in buffer F in the absence of GST-Rho-GDI. The supernatants (membrane extracts) and membranes were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against small G proteins (RhoA, RhoB, CDC42, and Rac1). Guanine nucleotide-sensitive PLD activity was detected in both membranes and cytosol of HL60 cells (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to previous reports (25Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 26Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Tolly I.F. Truong O.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) significant GTPγS stimulation of PLD activity was observed in the membranes in the absence of cytosol, but only when exogenous [3H]dipalmitoyl-PC was employed as substrate together with PE and PIP2in the molar ratio described by Brown et al. (25Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). In the absence of PIP2, the activity was very low (data not shown, see Ref. 25Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The stimulation was enhanced by the addition of cytosol (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, [3H]myristic acid prelabeled membranes failed to exhibit GTPγS-sensitive [3H]PEth formation in the absence of cytosol (Fig. 1 B). Since oleate has been reported to stimulate membrane PLD in some cell types (5Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), its effects were tested on HL60 membranes using exogenous [3H]dipalmitoyl-PC, but no stimulation was observed (data not shown). To study the GTPγS-sensitive cytosolic PLD activity, HL60 cytosol was fractionated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. A peak of GTPγS-dependent PLD activity was eluted in the early part of the NaCl gradient (Fig. 2). In order to investigate the involvement of SMGs, column fractions were also immunoblotted using anti-ARF, anti-RhoA, and anti-CDC42Hs antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, these SMGs were found in the fractions containing PLD activity. However, ARF immunoreactivity corresponded to the major fractions exhibiting GTPγS-dependent PLD activity, although there was a minor component of PLD activity (fractions 30-34) that coeluted with RhoA and CDC42. In addition, we assayed the remaining inactive fractions in the presence of bovine cytosolic ARF (sARF) and detected no ARF-responsive enzyme. The fractions corresponding to the peak of GTPγS-stimulated PLD activity were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon YM 10 membrane. To determine the molecular size of the ARF-responsive PLD, the concentrated pool was further fractionated by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 column. A lesser peak of GTPγS-stimulated PLD activity was observed in the fractions that contained ARF (Fig. 3). Assuming that PLD activity may have separated from endogenous ARF, we assayed the remaining fractions in the presence of sARF. This revealed a peak of GTPγS-stimulated PLD activity, which corresponded to a molecular mass of >150 kDa (Fig. 3). The nature of the higher molecular mass material was not determined, but it was assumed to be aggregated enzyme. To further explore a role for ARF in the regulation of cytosolic PLD, we also chromatographed the concentrated pool of DEAE fractions on a hydroxylapatite column. Fractions from this column totally failed to show any GTPγS-stimulated PLD activity unless reconstituted with bovine sARF (Fig. 4). The ARF-responsive PLD activity eluted in the late phase of the phosphate gradient. Endogenous ARF from the same column also restored the PLD activity, but no activity was detected with fractions containing endogenous Rho A or CDC42. The concentrated pool of active PLD fractions from DEAE-Sephacel, hereinafter referred to as the DEAE fraction, was used for further characterization of the cytosolic PLD. The time course of PEth formation in the presence of GTPγS was linear for 40 min, but essentially no activity was seen in the absence of the nucleotide (data not shown). The time course was similar to that of the membrane-associated activity (assayed with exogenous [3H]PC), except that the latter showed significant activity in the absence of GTPγS (data not shown). The GTPγS concentration producing half-maximal stimulation of PEth formation by either cytosol or membranes was less than 1 μM (Fig. 5). This is similar to that observed in cytosol-depleted HL60 cells in the presence of ARF (26Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Tolly I.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). GTPγS-dependent PLD activity in the DEAE fraction was linearly proportional to protein concentration up to 10 μg (data not shown). Although millimolar Ca2+ has been reported to stimulate PLD activity in HL60 cell membranes assayed using endogenous substrate (21Anthes J.C. Wang P. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), the cation had a negligible stimulatory effect when the membranes were assayed with exogenous PC, and was inhibitory at concentrations of 2 m M and higher (Fig. 6). In contrast, PLD in the DEAE fraction showed a 2-fold stimulation with 2 m M Ca2+ (corresponding to 165 n M free Ca2+, see the legend to Fig. 6), which was lost at higher Ca2+ concentrations. In view of a previous report indicating the involvement of an unidentified Rho family SMG in the regulation of PLD (27Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we utilized HL60 membranes to examine GTPγS-stimulated PLD activity as a function of increasing concentrations of GST-Rho-GDI (Fig. 7 A). As observed earlier (27Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GTPγS-stimulated membrane PLD activity, assayed using endogenous substrate ([3H]myristate-labeled membranes) in the presence of cytosol, was significantly inhibited by micromolar Rho-GDI. However, when assayed in the absence of cytosol using exogenous [3H]PC, Rho-GDI was more potent and efficacious in inhibiting the PLD activity (Fig. 7 B). Since treatment of membranes with Rho-GDI has been reported to extract post-translationally modified Rho proteins (35Leonard D. Hart M.J. Platko J.V. Eva A. Henzel W. Evans T. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22860-22868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bouguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar), Western blotting of the supernatants was performed using antibodies to RhoA, RhoB, CDC42, Rac1, and Rac2. The results showed that RhoA was significantly extracted from the membranes, whereas Rac1, Rac2, or CDC42 were not detected in the extracts (data not shown). The presence of Rac1, Rac2, and CDC42 was also examined in unextracted HL60 membranes, and these were also found to be absent (data not shown). In contrast, HL60 cytosol showed the presence of CDC42 and RhoA, but not Rac1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 2 and data not shown). The GDI-extracted membranes were tested for the restoration of GTPγS-dependent PLD activity after reconstitution with recombinant RhoA, CDC42, and Rac1. All of these SMGs partially restored the PLD activity in the order of efficacy RhoA > CDC42 > Rac1 (Fig. 8). In the absence of GTPγS, none of the SMGs was effective (data not shown). Interestingly, recombinant RhoA and Rac1 were also effective in a dose-dependent manner on unextracted membranes, whereas CDC42 was ineffective (Fig. 9). To further explore the role of RhoA, we also studied the translocation of Rho proteins from cytosol to membranes in the presence of GTPγS. Although RhoA and CDC42 were detected in HL60 cytosol, only RhoA was translocated in a time-dependent manner in the presence of GTPγS (Fig. 10). PLD activity in unextracted membranes was also tested with bovine sARF, and a stimulation was observed (Fig. 11), as expected (25Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The reconstitution of membranes with a mixture of increasing concentrations of recombinant RhoA and bovine sARF showed a synergistic effect on PLD activity, although this was not marked (Fig. 11).FIG. 9Effect of recombinant Rho proteins on the PLD activity of unextracted membranes. HL60 membranes (30 μg) were preincubated with indicated concentrations of RhoA, CDC42, and Rac1 in the presence of GTPγS (30 μM) on ice for 15 min. The incubations were continued at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of 1% ethanol.

Data are representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HL60 cells are one of the most extensively studied cell types with respect to the regulation of PLD activity. It is generally believed that the PLD activity in these cells is located in the particulate fraction and that its stimulation by guanine nucleotides is mediated by cytosolic factors. One of the cytosolic factors has recently been identified as ARF. Like previous findings, our studies with [3H]myristic acid-labeled cell membranes also indicate the requirement of cytosol for GTPγS-dependent PLD activity. However, when we assayed the enzyme with exogenous substrate according to Brown et al. (25Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar), surprisingly, we found GTPγS-dependent activity in the soluble as well as the particulate fraction. Furthermore, we found that the PLD activity in the particulate fraction could be stimulated up to 5-fold with GTPγS in the absence of cytosol. These two interesting observations provoked us to further investigate the regulation of PLD activity in both particulate and soluble fractions. Our observations are consistent with the finding that the stimulation of the hydrolysis of exogenous PC by membrane PLD in the presence of GTPγS plus ARF requires the addition of PIP2(25Brown H.A.

However, when exogenous [3H]PC was used as substrate in the presence of PIP2, PLD stimulation by GTPγS was evident in the membranes in the absence of cytosol or ARF. As will be discussed below, these results can be explained by the presence of two PLD isoforms, one responsive to ARF and another to Rho. The use of exogenous substrate also made it possible to uncover the presence of PLD in the cytosol. Chromatography of this fraction separated the PLD activity from SMGs. Although several SMGs were found, the initial co-elution of PLD activity with ARF immunoreactivity supported the involvement of ARF in the regulation of cytosolic PLD activity. Further evidence was obtained when the PLD activity peak from DEAE was separated from the SMGs by two different chromatographic procedures. In fractions in which PLD was separated from ARF, activity was restored by either endogenous ARF (separated on the column) or exogenous ARF (bovine sARF). However, RhoA and CDC42 were ineffective. It is interesting to note that GTPγS-dependent PLD activity could also be detected in bovine brain or rat liver cytosol. 2A. R. Siddiqi, J. L. Smith, A. H. Ross, R.-G. Qiu, M. Symons, and J. H. Exton, unpublished results. This was barely measurable in crude cytosol but came enriched after DEAE chromatography. Both membrane and cytosolic PLDs were GTPγS-dependent and showed very similar dependence on the nucleotide. However, the basal activity of the membrane PLD was significant, whereas that of the cytosolic PLD was barely detectable. Furthermore, Ca2+ ions had very different effects on cytosolic and membrane PLD. These data raise the possibility of different PLD isozymes in the two subcellular locations, although this remains speculative until the cytosolic and membrane enzymes are purified and characterized. The cytosolic PLD was stimulated by ARF but not RhoA or CDC42 (which are all present in the cytosol), whereas the membrane PLD could be stimulated by members of the Rho family (RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42) and also ARF (Figs. 9 and 11). Previously, Bowman et al. (27Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that GTPγS stimulation of the membrane PLD could be inhibited by Rho-specific GDI (27Bowman E.P. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21509-21512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed similar results and also found that the inhibition by Rho-GDI was more marked in the absence of cytosol (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, we observed that in membranes extracted with Rho-specific GDI, it was possible to partially restore the GTPγS stimulation by reconstitution with recombinant RhoA, CDC42, and Rac1. Bovine sARF also restored PLD activity in the extracted membranes, probably because of the presence of both Rho-specific and ARF-specific PLD isozymes. Surprisingly, the stimulation by Rho family G proteins did not show much specificity, since all tested Rho recombinant proteins (RhoA, CDC42, Rac1) could restore PLD activity in GDI-extracted or untreated membranes, although to varying extents. 3Comparison of Figs. 9 and 10 shows that RhoA and Rac1 were unable to completely restore GTPγS stimulation of PLD in the GDI-extracted membranes but could significantly enhance the stimulation when added to untreated membranes. This indicates that the GDI treatment procedure produced additional changes that diminished the ability of PLD to respond to these SMGs. Comparison of the figures also shows that the relative potency of RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42 was changed. We do not know the reason for these differences, but they could be due to the extraction of GDP dissociation stimulator(s) and/or other proteins that control the activity of these SMGs. However, Western blotting revealed that, of these proteins, only RhoA was detectable in the membranes, implying that this was the Rho family member that exerted endogenous control on the enzyme. To further emphasize the role of RhoA, we also studied the translocation of Rho proteins from cytosol to the membranes in the absence and presence of GTPγS (Fig. 10). Among RhoA, RhoB, and CDC42, only RhoA was translocated in the presence of nucleotide in a time-dependent manner. Again, Rac1 could not be detected in either cytosol or membranes. These findings support the involvement of RhoA in the regulation of membrane PLD. Although, RhoA and ARF synergistically stimulate membrane PLD, stimulation by RhoA does not require the presence of ARF. 4The weak synergistic interaction between RhoA and ARF could be explained by the presence of two types of PLD in the membranes, one of which responds to Rho or ARF only and another that responds to both ARF and Rho. However, since it has not been shown that PLD is the immediate target of these SMGs rather than another regulatory protein, other explanations are possible. Contrary to membrane PLD, cytosolic PLD responds to ARF, but not to Rho, i.e. it must be different from one of the membrane isozymes. The existence of different PLD isozymes makes it possible to explain the different results obtained with membranes using exogenous versus endogenous substrate. For example, although an ARF-responsive isozyme is present in the membranes (25Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 26Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Tolly I.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Science. 1994; 263: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), it cannot be responsible for the effects of GTPγS added alone since ARF is lacking in the membranes. On the other hand, a RhoA-responsive enzyme and RhoA are both present in the membranes (cf. Fig. 1 A and Fig. 10), and this isozyme could therefore mediate the effects of GTPγS. If this isozyme were able to utilize exogenous PC (under the specific assay conditions) efficiently, this could explain the results. The existence of other isozymes in the membranes that utilize PC less efficiently could explain why a GTPγS effect is not detectable in the membranes in the absence of cytosol or ARF when the endogenous substrate is labeled. In summary, our observations support the results of earlier investigations into the control of PLD by ARF and Rho (25Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar, 26Cockcroft S. Thomas G.M.H. Fensome A. Geny B. Cunningham E. Gout I. Hiles I. Tolly I.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25951-25954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They strongly suggest the existence of PLD isozymes that differ in cellular location and regulation. The Rho-regulated isozyme appears to be present only in membranes, while the ARF-responsive enzyme is found in both cytosol and membranes. However, since ARF is absent from the isolated membranes, it would have to be translocated there in order to regulate the enzyme, and this may be true for Rho also. Clearly, elucidation of the mechanisms of regulation of PLD by both SMGs will require much further work. We thank Y. Zheng and R.

The process of mediated nuclear import is known to involve at least two steps: ATP-independent binding to the cytoplasmic face of nuclear pores, followed by translocation through the nuclear pore complex dependent on ATP hydrolysis (2Newmeyer D.D.

Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which binds to a family of nuclear pore complex proteins, is known to inhibit the latter step of transport (4Finlay D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Price T.M. Forbes D.J. J.

Here we show in vitro evidence that a karyophilic protein actually forms a complex with cytoplasmic factors for nuclear pore targeting in the active nuclear transport process.

Synthetic peptides containing SV40 large T antigen wild-type NLS (CYGGPKKKRKVEDP: T-peptide) or transport incompetent point-mutated NLS (CYGGPKTKRKVEDP: mutant T-peptide) were purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan), and WGA from E˙Y Laboratories, Inc.

For preparation of biotinylated bovine serum albumin (bBSA), 100 μl of 2 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (NHS-LC-biotin) (Pierce) dissolved in distilled water was mixed with 800 μl of 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) dissolved in 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.5, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and dialyzed against 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Allophycocyanin (APC) (Calbiochem) and bBSA were conjugated with T-peptide or mutant T-peptide to produce T-APC, T-bBSA, and mutant T-APC as described previously (10Yoneda Y. Arioka T. Imamoto-Sonobe N. Sugawa H. Shimonishi Y. Uchida T. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 170: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All the conjugates contained 10-15 peptides per carrier molecule (analyzed by SDS-PAGE). Ehrlich ascites tumor cells were freshly harvested from the abdominal cavity of mice, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (137 m M NaCl, 2.7 m M KCl, 8.1 m M Na2HPO4, 1.5 m M KH2PO4, pH 7.2), once in washing buffer (10 m M HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 m M CH3COOK, 2 m M (CH3COO)2Mg, 2 m M dithiothreitol) and then lysed in lysis buffer (5 m M HEPES, pH 7.3, 10 m M CH3COOK, 2 m M (CH3COO)2Mg, 2 m M dithiothreitol, 20 μM cytochalasin B, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin). Extracts were clarified by sequential centrifugation (1,500 × g for 15 min; 15,000 × g for 20 min; 100,000 × g for 30 min) as described by Adam et al. (11Adam S.A. Sterne Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) For total lysate preparation, the clarified extract was concentrated to 20-40 mg/ml protein concentration by vacuum dialysis against transport buffer (20 m M HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 m M CH3COOK, 2 m M (CH3COO)2Mg, 5 m M CH3COONa, 0.5 m M EGTA, 2 m M dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin) in a collodion apparatus (Schleicher & Schull). For cytosol fractionation, the clarified extract was applied to Q-Sepharose fast flow columns (Pharmacia LKB) equilibrated with lysis buffer and eluted sequentially with CH3COOK free transport buffer containing 200 m M, 350 m M, and 550 m M KCl. Flow-through fraction and eluted fractions (termed QFT, Q200, Q350, and Q550, respectively) were dialyzed against transport buffer and concentrated in the collodion apparatus to uniform protein concentration (10 mg/ml). For preparation of histone H1-depleted cytosol and control cytosol, 2 volumes of total cytosol was mixed with 1 volume of histone H1 or lysozyme-conjugated Sepharose and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. Unreacted supernatants after centrifugation (7,000 rpm, 1 min) were used for transport assay. 200 μl of Q550 incubated for 2 h on ice with 200 ng of 125I-labeled T-BSA (specific activity, 1 × 107cpm/μg protein) was layered over a 7-15% linear sucrose gradient based on transport buffer. After centrifugation (200,000 × g, 12 h, 4°C in Beckman SW 41Ti), 0.3-ml fractions were collected from the tube bottoms and respective radioactivities were measured using a Beckman γ counter (model 8000). To examine the specificity of complex formation, the same experiments were performed with other Q-Sepharose fractions. 200 μl of Q550 incubated with 10 μg of transport substrate (2 h on ice) or reconstituted complex was applied to Superdex TM200 HR 10/30 connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia LKB). Samples separated in transport buffer at 0.5 ml/min flow rate were collected into 0.5-ml fractions and examined for targeting activity. A protein complex formed in Q550 with either T-APC or T-bBSA was recovered reproducibly in fraction 24/25. To obtain targeting complex components, Q550 was applied to immobilized avidin (Pierce) precharged with T-bBSA (250 μg T-bBSA/1 ml gel). After extensive washing with transport buffer, proteins associated with T-bBSA were either eluted with CH3COOK free transport buffer containing 2 M NaCl or with 0-1.5 M NaCl gradient based on transport buffer containing 25 m M n-octyl-β- D-glucoside (Dojin, Kumamoto, Japan). For reconstitution of the targeting complex, 2 μg of T-bBSA and 100 μg of carrier BSA were mixed with 0.1-ml aliquots of eluted materials and dialyzed against transport buffer. For the experiment shown in Fig. 3 C, 30 μg of T-bBSA was mixed with 0.2 ml of 2 M NaCl-eluted materials containing 30-μg proteins, without adding carrier BSA, and dialyzed against transport buffer prior to gel filtration. Notably, eluted materials precipitated when eluted samples were dialyzed against transport buffer without adding NLS-containing substrates. Transport assays were performed essentially as described previously (7Okuno Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Adam S.A. Sterne Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). 10 μl of testing cytosols containing 100 ng of transport substrates or isolated, and reconstituted complexes were incubated with permeabilized cells for 30 min, with or without 1 m M ATP, 5 m M creatine phosphate, and 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase at 30°C, or on ice, as described in the respective figure legends. After incubation, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in transport buffer. To visualize T-bBSA localization, the fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 2 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin (Pierce) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mg/ml BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then examined using an Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Staining of nuclear binding was faint and could be observed clearly only with an oil immersion lens. For quantitative analysis, the image was focused on a plane corresponding to a section through the center of the nucleus. Most of the nuclei in each field of view were usually in the same focal plane. Fluorescence intensity was quantified by scanning photographic negatives with a dual wavelength TLC scanner (Shimadzu CS-930). hsc70 was purified from the cytoplasm of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells as described previously (8Imamoto N. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Kohno K. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Okada Y. Tsunasawa S. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically on to nitrocellulose sheets. Western blots were probed with anti-hsc70 rabbit serum (8Imamoto N. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Kohno K. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Okada Y. Tsunasawa S. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or anti-Ran/TC4 rabbit serum (9Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Seino H. Nishimoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24542-24545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in TBS buffer (20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl) containing 1% skim milk for 2 h at room temperature after blocking with TBS buffer containing 3% skim milk for 4 h. Rabbit antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) by the standard method. Previously we showed that cytoplasmic injection of antibodies against 70-kDa heat-shock cognate protein (hsc70) inhibited nuclear import in living cells (8Imamoto N. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Kohno K. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Okada Y. Tsunasawa S. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Using a digitonin-permeabilized cell-free transport assay, we confirmed that hsc70 is a necessary but not sufficient cytoplasmic factor to support active nuclear import of SV40 T-antigen NLS-containing karyophile (7Okuno Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we attempted to identify other cytoplasmic factors required for nuclear import, initially by fractionating cytosolic extracts in two distinct manners, and examining their ability to support the nuclear import of SV40 T-antigen NLS (T-peptide) conjugates (T-APC and T-BSA) in a digitonin-permeabilized cell-free transport assay. As one of two fractionation procedures, total cytosol prepared from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was fractionated by Q-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography as described under “Materials and Methods.” Each fraction separated by Q-Sepharose, as well as hsc70 alone, supported little or no nuclear import by itself (Fig. 1 A, b-f). However, combination of the two fractions eluted with 200 m M KCl and 550 m M KCl, termed Q200 and Q550, respectively, reconstituted the nuclear import of T-peptide conjugates (Fig. 1 A, g). Addition of hsc70 alone to Q200 or Q550, or other combinations of two separated fractions, did not reconstitute the import (data not shown). The other procedure was based on previous evidence which indicated that a small basic karyophilic protein, histone H1, is complexed in the cytoplasm, and therefore accumulates in the nucleus via mediated import pathway as do SV40 T-antigen NLS-containing karyophiles, whereas a small basic non-karyophilic protein, lysozyme, enters the nucleus by passive diffusion when injected into the cytoplasm of living cells (6Breeuwer M. Goldfarb D.S. Cell. 1990; 60: 999-1008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our previous evidence indicated that hsc70 is involved in nuclear import of both histone H1 and T-peptide conjugates (8Imamoto N. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Kohno K. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Okada Y. Tsunasawa S. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Here, we found that incubation of total cytosol with histone H1-conjugated Sepharose resulted in depletion of transport activity for T-peptide conjugates, whereas incubation with lysozyme-conjugated Sepharose did not (Fig. 1 B, a-c). Among hsc70 alone and the Q-Sepharose fractions, the addition of fraction Q550 to the H1-depleted cytosol restored the transport of T-peptide conjugates (Fig. 1 B, h). Pretreatment of permeabilized cells with WGA or treatment of Q550 with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) inhibited the transport of T-peptide conjugates in all these reconstitution experiments (data not shown). With incubation on ice in the absence of ATP, the transport substrate accumulated at the nuclear rim in the presence of unfractionated cytosol. Q550, alone or supplemented with H1-depleted cytosol, yielded the same rim staining (Fig. 1 C, a, c, and d). No such rim staining was observed in the presence of H1-depleted cytosol alone, other fractions eluted from Q-Sepharose, or transport buffer. In addition, mutant T-peptide conjugates, with or without Q550, failed to yield the same rim staining. Thus, it appears that rim staining obtained with Q550 shows the ATP-independent and NLS-dependent nuclear binding step of the transport. These results suggest that fraction Q550 contains factors that bind to karyophilic protein and support the nuclear pore binding step of transport. As shown in Fig. 2 A, upon incubation, T-BSA formed a complex in Q550 that was detectable by sucrose gradient analysis. No other Q-Sepharose fractions caused a shift in the T-BSA, indicating that complex formation occurred specifically in Q550. The complex formation in Q550 was markedly reduced in the presence of free T-peptide, but to a lesser extent by mutant T-peptide. We conclude that complex formation was competitively inhibited by active NLS, although 5 × 103- to 1 × 104-fold excess of free T-peptide over T-peptide in iodinated T-BSA was required for the inhibition. The requirement for high concentration of free T-peptide for competition may be due to the multivalent interaction of the T-peptide conjugate with NLS-binding protein(s) and/or absorption of free T-peptide by free NLS-binding proteins in Q550, which may be present in excess over iodinated T-BSA. To elucidate the biological significance of this complex, we isolated the complex by Superdex TM200 HR 10/30 and examined its nuclear binding activity. As shown in Fig. 2 B, a protein complex of about 500 kDa containing a transport substrate in fraction 24/25 showed nuclear rim binding activity in the absence of other cytoplasmic fractions. To confirm whether such rim staining actually shows the nuclear binding step of transport prior to nuclear entry, we examined transport in the presence of ATP at 30°C. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the transport substrate in the complex in fraction 24/25 showed only nuclear rim accumulation in the presence of ATP. In contrast, the addition of histone H1-depleted cytosol to fraction 24/25 supported nuclear entry of the transport substrate (assessed by homogeneous nuclear stainings) only in the presence of ATP. Neither rim nor homogeneous nuclear staining obtained in the presence of the H1-depleted fraction was observed upon pretreatment of permeabilized cells with WGA, whereas rim staining obtained in the absence of H1-depleted cytosol was only slightly inhibited (compare Fig. 2C, a, c, and f; discussed below). The use of fraction Q200 instead of histone H1-depleted cytosol gave the same results (data not shown). These results showed that in Q550, a T-peptide conjugate forms a stable complex which binds to the nuclear pore with no other cytoplasmic fractions and enters the nucleus dependent on factor(s) present in both H1-depleted cytosol and Q200 and on ATP hydrolysis. Therefore we term this complex nuclear pore-targeting complex. To purify and identify components of the complex, T-biotinylated BSA (T-bBSA) trapped in immobilized avidin was incubated with Q550. Four proteins of molecular masses 54, 56, 66, and 90 kDa were eluted with high salt after extensive washing with transport buffer. All four proteins dissociated specifically from T-bBSA in the presence of excess free T-peptide (data not shown). Immunoblotting analysis showed that eluted materials did not contain both hsc70 and Ran/TC4, although Q550 contained these two molecules (Fig. 3 A). To determine functionally whether these four proteins actually constitute the nuclear pore-targeting complex, T-bBSA was mixed with eluted materials and the mixture was dialyzed and examined for targeting activity. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, T-bBSA reconstituted a complex with the four proteins and showed nuclear binding activity in the absence of other factors. At the beginning of this study, we found that Q550 complemented the histone H1-depleted cytosol. Therefore, the four proteins which reconstituted the protein complex with T-peptide conjugates were expected to be depleted by histone H1-Sepharose. Materials eluted with high salt from H1-Sepharose were found to reconstitute the targeting activity with T-bBSA as shown in Fig. 4b. Finally, we confirmed that four proteins of molecular masses 54, 56, 66, and 90 kDa in the eluted materials were bound to T-bBSA after reconstitution of the targeting activity (Fig. 4 c, lane 7). These results show that histone H1-Sepharose depleted all components of the targeting complex from total cytosol. To determine whether the targeting activity of the complex depends on the presence of all four proteins, the proteins were separated by salt gradient elution from T-bBSA trapped in immobilized avidin. Proteins with molecular masses of 54 and 90 kDa were eluted slightly faster than the 56- and 66-kDa proteins. Examination of the targeting activity of protein complexes reconstituted with fractions containing predominantly either 54/90-, 54/56/66/90-, or 56/66-kDa proteins revealed that the targeting activity depended on the presence of 54- and 90-kDa proteins (Fig. 5), indicating that these proteins can reconstitute the targeting activity. In this study, we isolated a nuclear pore-targeting complex from a fraction designated Q550. Q550 was NEM-sensitive and supported only the binding step of transport. The addition of histone H1-depleted cytosol or Q200 was required for complete transport activity. Such properties of fraction Q550 resemble those of fraction A separated from Xenopus oocyte extracts by Moore and Blobel (12Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To date, NEM-sensitive 54/56-kDa NLS receptor purified from bovine erythrocytes (13Adam S.A. Gerace L.

Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) have been functionally identified as factors involved in nuclear protein import. Very recently, Adam and Adam (17Adam E.J.H. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) reported the identification and purification of bovine cytosolic NEM-sensitive 97 kDa protein required for the binding step of transport and that both 54/56-kDa NLS receptor and 97-kDa protein are necessary for the binding step. Judging from NEM sensitivity and molecular masses, 54- and 90-kDa proteins identified in this study might be mouse homologues of bovine 54/56-kDa and 97-kDa proteins. On the other hand, although Q550 contained hsc70 and Ran/TC4 proteins, these were not components of the nuclear pore-targeting complex (Fig. 3 A). The 90-kDa protein identified in this study did not cross-react with rabbit antibodies against the 90-kDa heat-shock protein (data not shown). Careful experiments must be carried out to determine whether hsc70 and Ran/TC4 play a role in the pore-binding step of transport. That is, transient association of hsc70 with NLSs (8Imamoto N. Matsuoka Y. Kurihara T. Kohno K. Miyagi M. Sakiyama F. Okada Y. Tsunasawa S. Yoneda Y. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1047-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 18Imamoto-Sonobe N. Matsuoka Y.

Alternatively, these proteins may be required for an other step in the transport process. Histone H1-Sepharose specifically depleted cytosolic factors that constitute the complex with T-peptide conjugates for the nuclear-pore targeting. These results support the idea that both histone H1 and T-peptide conjugates use common transport machinery to accumulate into the nucleus, although the NLS of histone H1 is unknown. Since many proteins were bound to histone H1-Sepharose (Fig. 4 c), it is yet unclear whether the four proteins identified in this study form a targeting complex with histone H1 directly or with other karyophilic protein(s) associated with histone H1. It remains unknown whether other kinds of karyophilic proteins such as karyophiles containing bipartite type NLS and snRNPs form a nuclear pore-targeting complex with the same components as those of the complex identified in this study. WGA is well known to inhibit the translocation step of transport, but not the initial binding step. However, in the present study, nuclear rim binding of a transport substrate was strongly inhibited by WGA in the presence of H1-depleted cytosol (Fig. 2 C, f) and only slightly inhibited in the absence of H1-depleted cytosol (Fig. 2 C, c). The inhibitory effect of WGA on the nuclear pore binding step in vitro was also reported previously by Adam and Adam (17Adam E.J.H. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). We suppose that H1-depleted cytosol contains some factor(s) which dissociates transport substrate bound at nuclear pores when the subsequent translocation step is inhibited. The slight inhibition of rim binding by WGA, observed in the absence of H1-depleted cytosol, may be due to a residual trace of dissociating activity in the permeabilized cells. Four proteins of molecular masses 54, 56, 66, and 90 kDa were found in the pore-targeting complex formed in Q550. We found that when Q550 was fractionated by gel filtration before adding transport substrate, no independent fractions supported pore targeting of T-peptide conjugates (data not shown). These results indicate that at least two factors are required for the targeting activity, indicating that both the 54- and 90-kDa proteins identified in this study are essential for reconstituting the targeting activity. Under our assay conditions, stimulation of the targeting activity of the complex was not seen when the complex was formed by adding 56/66-kDa proteins to the 54/90-kDa proteins. The roles of 56- and 66-kDa proteins in nuclear transport, which are tightly associated with T-peptide conjugates in an NLS-dependent manner, remains unclear. Since we used karyophiles containing multiple NLS peptides per molecule, it is possible that these two proteins may associate with NLS independently from 54- and 90-kDa proteins and act as different NLS receptors in conjunction with other cytoplasmic factors present in a fraction other than Q550. Alternatively, 56- and 66-kDa proteins may act with 54- and 90-kDa proteins to facilitate complex formation or stabilize the complex once formed. Further experiments are needed to determine whether these two proteins actually have a role in nuclear import. Further characterization of each component of the targeting complex identified in this study, together with analysis of its formation, nuclear pore targeting, and dissociation process, should lead to understanding of the precise molecular mechanism of nuclear protein import.

https://openalex.org/W2009865990,"Guayule plants accumulate large quantities of rubber within parenchyma cells of their stembark tissues. This rubber is packed within discrete organelles called rubber particles composed primarily of a lipophilic, cis-polyisoprene core, small amounts of lipids, and several proteins, the most abundant of which is the Mr53,000 rubber particle protein (RPP). We have cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA for RPP and show that it has 65% amino acid identity and 85% similarity to a cytochrome P450 known as allene oxide synthase (AOS), recently identified from flaxseed. RPP contains the same unusual heme-binding region and possesses a similar defective I-helix region as AOS, suggesting an equivalent biochemical function. Spectral analysis of solubilized RPP verifies it as a P450, and enzymatic assays reveal that it also metabolizes 13(S)-hydroperoxy-(9 Z,11 E)-octadecadienoic acid into the expected ketol fatty acids at rates comparable with flaxseed AOS. RPP is unusual in that it lacks the amino-terminal membrane anchor and the established organelle targeting sequences found on other conventional P450s. Together, these factors place RPP in the CYP74 family of P450s and establish it as the first P450 localized in rubber particles and the first eukaryotic P450 to be identified outside endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or plastids.

Rubber is a macromolecular polyisoprenoid found in over 2000 plant species (1Archer B.L. Audley B.G. Nord F. Miller L. Phytochemistry. Vol. 2. Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York1973: 310-343Google Scholar, 2Backhaus R.A. Isr. J. Bot. 1985; 34: 283-293Google Scholar). It accumulates in discrete, subcellular organelles called rubber particles that are approximately 1 μm in diameter and are composed of a polyisoprene core (3Gomez J.B.

Rubber Research Institute of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur1975: 441-456Google Scholar). In most rubber-producing species, such as Hevea brasiliensis, rubber particles are confined to latex vessels, which are specialized plant cells devoted to latex and secondary product synthesis. However, in the North American desert shrub, guayule (Parthenium argentatum), rubber particles accumulate within ordinary stembark parenchyma cells (4Backhaus R.A. Walsh S. Bot. Gaz. 1983; 144: 391-400Crossref Google Scholar). Consequently, its rubber is produced in otherwise normal cells, presenting a unique opportunity for study. Hevea, the commercial source of virtually all natural rubber, produces particles that contain dozens of proteins. Some of these proteins can trigger severe allergies in people who come in contact with products manufactured from Hevea latex. In contrast, guayule particles possess few proteins (8Backhaus R.A. Cornish K. Chen S.-F. Huang D.-S. Bess V.H. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2493-2497Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 9Cornish K. Siler D.J. Grosjean O.-K. Goodman N. J. Natl. Rubber Res. 1993; 8: 275-285Google Scholar), and none are known to cause allergies, making them a potential alternate source of latex products for medical applications (10Siler D.J. Cornish K.

From a biochemical perspective, this is less complex for guayule because its particles contain relatively few proteins. The most abundant is the Mr53,000 rubber particle protein (RPP), 1The abbreviations used are:RPPrubber particle protein13 S-HPOD13(S)-hydroperoxy-(9 Z,11 E)-octadecadienoic acidα-ketol12-oxo-13-hydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acidγ-ketol12-oxo-9-hydroxy-10(E)-octadecenoic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidGC-MSgas chromatography-mass spectrometryOTMStrimethylsilyloxy derivativeAOSallene oxide synthasebpbase pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are:RPPrubber particle protein13 S-HPOD13(S)-hydroperoxy-(9 Z,11 E)-octadecadienoic acidα-ketol12-oxo-13-hydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acidγ-ketol12-oxo-9-hydroxy-10(E)-octadecenoic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidGC-MSgas chromatography-mass spectrometryOTMStrimethylsilyloxy derivativeAOSallene oxide synthasebpbase pair(s). which has been purified (8Backhaus R.A.

It comprises approximately 50% of the protein in guayule particles and has been implicated as a rubber transferase (12Benedict C.R. Madhavan S. Greenblatt G.A. Venkatachalam K.V.

In this report, we now show that RPP is a member of the CYP74 family of cytochromes P450 and is likely not a prenyltransferase. This is based on the deduced amino acid sequence of RPP cDNAs isolated from a guayule stembark cDNA library. RPP shows significant sequence identity to the P450 known as allene oxide synthase (AOS) (13Song W.C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Additional biochemical analysis of partially purified RPP solubilized from washed rubber particles reveals a difference spectrum typical of P450s and, like AOS, an ability to rapidly metabolize hydroperoxylinoleic acid into α- and γ-ketol fatty acids (14Song W.C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). RPP and AOS share a number of significant features that distinguish them from conventional P450s. However, RPP also has several unique characteristics that differentiate it from flaxseed AOS. Guayule, P. argentatum Gray, line 11591, was used for all experiments. Tissues were collected from field-grown shrubs at the U. S. Department of Agriculture (Water Conservation Laboratory, Phoenix, AZ). Rubber particles were purified by flotation from homogenized stembark tissues (15Cornish K. Backhaus R.A. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3809-3813Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Particles were subjected to preparative SDS-PAGE (8Backhaus R.A. Cornish K. Chen S.-F. Huang D.-S. Bess V.H. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2493-2497Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). RPP migrated as a single Mr53,000 band that was purified from the gel by electroelution (model 422 Electroeluter, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RPP was subjected to CNBr cleavage by dissolving approximately 1 nmol of lyophilized protein in 150 μl of 70% formic acid followed by 100 μl of 70 μg of CNBr ml−1 in 70% formic acid. The mixture was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 24 h, and the peptide fragments were separated on a 16% acrylamide gel (16Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10469) Google Scholar) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membranes (17Ploug M. Jensen A.L. Barkholt V. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Stained bands were subjected to amino-terminal sequencing, performed at the Protein Structure Lab (U. C. Davis), using an ABI 470A gas phase sequenator. Four peptide fragments yielded the following amino acid sequences: 1, PLTKSVVYESLRIEPPV; 2, EQAEKLGVPKDEAVHNILFAVCFNTFGGVK; 3, LFGYQPFATKDPKVFDRPEEFVPDRFVGDGEALLKY; 4, LKNSSNRVIPQFETTYTELFEGLEA. Total RNA was isolated from guayule stembark tissues using the procedure of Logemann et al. (18Logemann J. Schell J. Willmitzer L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Tissues were harvested between November and March when rubber synthesis is highest. Poly(A)+ RNA was used to construct the λZAP stembark cDNA library according to Short et al. (19Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Triman K.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The library yielded 3 × 106recombinants before amplification. Approximately 1.5 × 105plaque-forming units from the original cDNA library were screened. Polyadenylated RNAs purified from stembark were used for first-strand cDNA synthesis (20Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 21-26Crossref Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in a 100-μl total volume containing 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA, 1 m M dNTPs, 0.1 μg of oligo(dT)12–18 (Amersham Corp.), 1 unit of RNase block II, and 100 units of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). Polymerase chain reactions were carried out in a 100-μl total volume using 1-2 units of Replinase (DuPont NEN) or AmpliTaq (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) with the following components: 1% of first-strand cDNA product, 50 pmol of each primer, 250 μM dNTPs in PCR buffer using 30 cycles (1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 45°C, and 1 min at 72°C). PCR reactions used degenerate primers specific for RPP peptide fragment 3 (sense strand P5, 5′-TTYGGNTAYCARCYNTTYGC-3′; and antisense strand P6, 5′-GCYTCNCCRTCNCCNACRAA-3′). Coding redundancies are: N = C, T, A, or G; H = A, C, or T; S = G or C; R = A or G; B = C, G, or T; K = G or T; Y = C or T; V = A, C, or G; W = A or T; M = A or C; D = A, G or T. The 92-bp product was sequenced according to Kretz et al. (21Kretz K.A. Carson G.S. O'Brien J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to verify that it matched the sequence for peptide fragment 3. A second pair of primers (sense strand P1, 5′-ATHCYNCARTTYGARAC-3′; and antisense strand P9, 5′-TTNACNCCNCCRAANGTRTTRAA-3′) produced a 434-bp product that also matched the upstream portion of RPP. These 92- and 434-bp RPP probes were used to screen the cDNA library. Plaque lifts were prepared using Colony/Plaque Screen (DuPont NEN) and probed with a [α-32P]dATP-labeled PCR fragment (22Sambrook J. Fritch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridizations were carried out at 65°C for 16 h in 5 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate), 50 m M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 5 × Denhardt's solution (1 × Denhardt's solution is 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 0.5% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate. Filters were washed four times as follows: 1) 10 min, 2 × SSC at room temperature; 2) 10 min, 2 × SSC, 1% SDS at room temperature; 3) 30 min, 2 × SSC, 1% SDS at 65°C, and 4) 10 min, 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature. The filters were exposed to Kodak x-ray films with intensifying screens at −80°C. Plaques giving the strongest hybridization signals were isolated and rescreened under the same conditions. Phagemids were obtained from purified positive plaques through in vivo excision as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). Over 30 RPP cDNAs were isolated to yield four full-length clones, one of which is the clone described herein. All sequencing was by the dideoxy technique (23Kraft R. Tardiff J. Kraauter K.S. Leinwand L.A. Bio Technology. 1988; 6: 544-547Google Scholar) using Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequence comparisons to the genetic data base were made using the BLAST algorithm (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70300) Google Scholar). Rubber particles isolated from stembark homogenates were purified by washing at least three times using the flotation and centrifugation procedure (15Cornish K. Backhaus R.A. Phytochemistry. 1990; 29: 3809-3813Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), except that 50 m M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) was used as the extraction and wash buffer in place of Tris-HCl. RPP was solubilized by sonicating 3×-washed particles in 0.5% CHAPS for 1 min. This was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the solution beneath the rubber layer was removed and passed through a Millex-SLGV 0.22-μm filter (Millipore). This eliminated all remaining traces of rubber and yielded a clear solution containing the solubilized RPP. Each step of the protein isolation was monitored by SDS-PAGE using 0.75-mm slab gels of 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide stained with Coomassie Blue. Scanning densitometry of the Coomassie-stained gels indicated that the RPP band comprised about 50% of the total protein in rubber particles. The clarified RPP solution was used for P450 spectral analysis and enzyme assays. The concentration of total protein in this clarified preparation was 363 ng μl−1 based on a comparison against a bovine serum albumin standard. Additional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the RPP band contained a single polypeptide and not a mixture of polypeptides. P450 difference spectra were obtained by diluting the CHAPS-solubilized RPP preparation in 50 m M potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and distributing it to 3-ml reference and sample cuvettes. Both cuvettes were reduced with Na-dithionite, and the sample cuvette was bubbled with CO to produce a difference spectrum with a characteristic peak at 451 nm. The fully developed chromophore appeared after 5 min. The quantity of P450 in the solubilized RPP preparation, determined from the differential absorption of the CO-bound reduced form of P450, using the value of A450-A490 = 91 m M cm−1 (26Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was 0.16 pmol μl−1 or 36.7 ng μl−1. Using this value, the content of P450 per total protein was approximately 10%. Comparing this to the densitometry values, we estimated that the range of P450/mg of protein in the particles was between 10-50%. To test whether RPP was capable of metabolizing lipid hydroperoxides, the same filtered, CHAPS-solubilized preparations were used. AOS activity was measured spectrophotometrically (14Song W.C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) using purified 13(S)-hydroperoxy-(9 Z,11 E)-octadecadienoic acid (13 S-HPOD) that was prepared according to Ref. 25Gardner H.W. Newton J.W. Phytochemistry. 1987; 26: 621-626Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar. The reaction was initiated by adding 3 μl of CHAPS-solubilized RPP to 3 ml of 50 m M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 13 S-HPOD at a final concentration of 53.8 μM (1.4 absorbance units at 234 nm). The quantity of P450 in this solubilized RPP preparation was 0.48 pmol based on P450 difference spectra (26Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AOS activity was measured by a series of UV spectra taken at 10-s intervals, which showed the rapid degradation of substrate due to the loss of its conjugated diene. One-half of the substrate disappeared after 45 s, resulting in an estimated kcat of 3700 s−1 for this enzyme. A large scale reaction was prepared using 20 μl of CHAPS-solubilized RPP (7.2 μg of protein) and 2 mg of 13 S-HPOD in 6 ml of 50 m M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) incubated at 22°C for 60 min. The products of the AOS reaction were extracted with 1.5 volumes of a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of chloroform:methanol. The chloroform-extracted products were separated as the free fatty acids on precoated, silica gel TLC plates (T-6270, Sigma) according to the method of Gardner (28Gardner H.W. J. Lipid Res. 1970; 11: 311-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using isooctane:ether:acetic acid (50:50:1, v/v/v) with detection by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine spray (29Vioque E. Holman R.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 99: 522-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For isolation, the products were methyl-esterified by a brief exposure to diazomethane in diethyl ether:CH3OH (9:1, v/v) and separated by TLC (20 × 20 × 0.025 cm, silica 60 F-254 plates, Merck) using development by hexane:ethyl ether (3:2, v/v). Detection was with a non-destructive spray, 0.1% 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (Na salt) followed by long UV viewing. Fluorescent bands were scraped and extracted with ethyl acetate. The recovered products were examined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 1H-NMR and/or 13C-NMR, using a Bruker model ARX-400 spectrometer (Karlsruhe, Germany) with the samples dissolved in CDCl3(CDCl3served as internal reference). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was completed by a Hewlett Packard model 5890 (capillary column, Hewlett Packard HP-5MS cross-linked 5% phenylmethyl silicone, 0.25 mm × 30 m, film thickness 0.25 mm) interfaced with a model 5971 mass selective detector operating at 70 eV. The temperature program was from 160 to 260°C at 5°C min−1 with a hold at 260°C for 10 min. The helium flow rate was 0.67 ml min−1. All products were examined by GC-MS as their methyl ester/trimethylsilyloxy (OTMS) derivatives. OTMS derivatives of hydroxy groups were synthesized with trimethylchlorosilane:hexamethyl-disilazane:pyridine (3:2:2, v/v/v). Other derivatives for GC-MS were produced by either NaBH4reduction of the ketone group or reduction of the double bond by H2with a 5% palladium on CaCO3catalyst followed by treatment with OTMS reagent. NH2-terminal Edman sequencing was performed on four CNBr fragments of gel-purified RPP (Table I). RPP cDNA was cloned using a strategy based on these amino acid sequences. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used to produce RPP-specific DNA fragments by PCR. These were used as hybridization probes to screen our cDNA library and provided over 30 clones, four of which contained putative full-length sequences.Table I:N-terminal sequence analysis of the CNBr fragments from the guayule rubber particle proteinThe pmol yield for each cycle is indicated. Inconclusive assignments are indicated in parentheses. The pmol yield for each cycle is indicated. Inconclusive assignments are indicated in parentheses. The full-length RPP cDNA contained 1692 nucleotides, including 23 nucleotides of 5′- and 250 nucleotides of 3′-untranslated sequence. It encoded a protein of 473 amino acids, with an NH2-terminal methionine, a COOH-terminal isoleucine, and two internal cysteines (Fig. 1). The deduced Mr53,438 protein contained the four predicted CNBr peptide fragments, and its deduced isoelectric point (pI 6.15) matched the experimental value (pI 6.2) of purified RPP (8Backhaus R.A. Cornish K. Chen S.-F. Huang D.-S. Bess V.H. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2493-2497Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A comparison of the deduced and measured amino acid composition (8Backhaus R.A. Cornish K. Chen S.-F. Huang D.-S. Bess V.H. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 2493-2497Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was also in agreement. Primer extension analysis revealed that RPP mRNA extended about 35 nucleotides upstream from the 5′-end of the RPP cDNA (data not shown), indicating that the cDNA was a full-length clone for RPP. The sequence flanking the first AUG initiation codon (5′-AAAACAUGG-3′) represented high homology to the consensus AUG start site (5′-TAAACAAUGG-3′ and 5′-AAAA(A/C)AUGG-3′) for translation initiation in plants (30Cavener D.R. Ray S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3185-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 31Joshi C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6643-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), providing additional evidence that this cDNA contained the entire RPP-coding sequence. A search of the genetic sequence data base identified two small regions in RPP that shared significant homology with two small regions of several cytochrome P450s (32Kalb V.F. Loper J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7221-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Gonzalez F.J. Coon M.J. Gunsalus I.C. Gotoh S. Okuda K. Nebert D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). Those regions aligned with two highly conserved B and C domains (32Kalb V.F. Loper J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7221-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which are common to all P450s (Fig. 2). Additionally, RPP contained a conserved PPGP tetrapeptide near the amino terminus (Fig. 1) that is also common in P450s and is known to participate in P450 stability and catalysis (34Szczesna-Skorpa E. Straub P. Kemper B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, RPP did not contain the highly conserved A and D domains that are essential components of most P450s. Careful comparison of the RPP sequence with that of CYP73, a plant P450 known as cinnamic acid hydrolase (CA4H) (35Teutsch H.G. Hasenfratz M.P. Lesot A. Stoltz C. Garnier J. Jeltsch J. Durst F. Werck-Reichhart D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4102-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), suggested that the CAG of RPP could act as a putative heme-binding site necessary for P450 action. However, the amino acid sequence surrounding this CAG (Fig. 1) was inconsistent with the known P450 consensus decapeptide of F-(SGNA)- X-(GD)- X-(RHPT)- X-C-(LIVMFAP)-(GAD) (32Kalb V.F. Loper J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7221-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This, together with the absence of the A domain, suggested that RPP might not act as a true P450. Thus, studies were performed to verify whether RPP possessed the spectral characteristics of P450s. RPP solubilized from washed rubber particles did, in fact, yield a difference spectra for the CO-bound, dithionite-reduced form that clearly indicated that it was a P450 with an absorbance maximum at 451 nm (Fig. 3).FIG. 3Difference spectra of purified RPP. Reference and sample cuvettes containing RPP were reduced with Na-dithionite, and the sample cuvette was bubbled with CO to produce a characteristic peak at 451 nm. The fully developed chromophore appeared after 5 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Subsequent to this, we discovered that RPP had significant homology with the amino acid sequence for AOS from flaxseed, whose cDNA was recently described (13Song W.C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). RPP showed over 65% identity and 85% similarity to AOS, which is now known to be an atypical P450, classified as CYP74 (33Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Estabrook R.W.

AOS, noted for its unusual heme-binding site (13Song W.C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), possesses a 15-amino acid peptide sequence that is nearly identical to the putative heme-binding CAG region of RPP (Fig. 4). This sequence, beginning at RPP position 419, shows over 86% identity with the corresponding flaxseed AOS sequence (Fig. 4) and hints that RPP and AOS might catalyze similar reactions. AOS, also previously known as hydroperoxide isomerase (36Zimmerman D.C. Vick B.A. Plant Physiol. 1970; 46: 445-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Zimmerman D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), hydroperoxide cyclase (38Zimmerman D.C. Feng P. Lipids. 1978; 13: 313-316Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar), fatty acid hydroperoxide dehydrase (39Hamberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 920: 76-84Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and hydroperoxide dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.92), is classified as a hydroperoxide-dependent P450. It metabolizes lipid hydroperoxides into their corresponding allene epoxides by intramolecular oxygen transfer (39Hamberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 920: 76-84Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Enzyme analysis was performed using RPP solubilized from washed rubber particles. SDS-PAGE gels indicated that the preparations were greatly enriched for RPP (Fig. 5). The AOS activity of the CHAPS-solubilized preparation (Fig. 5, lane 3) had an estimated kcat of 3700 s−1, as determined by scanning UV spectroscopy. This is within the same order of magnitude as flaxseed AOS, which has a kcat of approximately 1000 s−1 (14Song W.C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Analysis of the reaction products by TLC, NMR, and GC-MS also confirmed that RPP had AOS activity. These products consisted of the same α- and γ-ketol fatty acids that are observed with flaxseed (14Song W.C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 36Zimmerman D.C. Vick B.A. Plant Physiol. 1970; 46: 445-453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Zimmerman D.C. Biochem. Biophys.

The α- and γ-ketols result from the rapid degradation of allene oxide produced by the AOS reaction. The α-ketol, as its methyl ester, was isolated by TLC (RF = 0.34), affording a 56% yield based on the amount of utilized 13 S-HPOD (1.96 mg). 1H-NMR of the α-ketol (methyl ester) furnished the following data in chemical shifts in ppm and number of protons, multiplicity, coupling constants and carbon assignments: 5.62 (1H, dt, J9,10 = 10.8 Hz; J10,11 = 7.3 Hz, C-10 or −9), 5.51 (1H, dt, C-9 or −10), 4.23 (1H, m, C-13), 3.67 (3H, s, OCH3), 3.40 (1H, d, J = 5.0 Hz, OH at C-13), 3.22 and 3.24 (1H each, d, J10,11 = 7.3 Hz, C-11a, b), 2.29 (2H, t, J = 7.5 Hz, C-2), 2.01 (2H, m, C-8), 1.48 and 1.81 (1H each, m, C-14a, b), 1.60 (2H, m, C-3), 1.30 (14H, m, C-4 to −7 and C-15 to −17), 0.88 (3H, t, C-18). The assignments were confirmed by two-dimensional proton correlative spectroscopy. A significant feature of the 1H-NMR spectrum was the coupling J9,10 = 10.8 Hz establishing the (Z) configuration of the double bond. An unusual splitting of the C-13 OH proton was due to hydrogen bonding to the vicinal ketone, which inhibited the normal hydrogen exchange and lack of coupling of hydroxyl hydrogens. The 13C-NMR of the α-ketol (methyl ester) furnished an absorbance"

Although assembly was delayed, the presence of slowly migrating, overmodified α1(I) and α2(I) chains indicated that mutant proα1(I) could associate with normal proα1(I) and proα2(I) to form pepsin-resistant triple-helical molecules, a proportion of which were secreted. Further evidence of the aberrant folding of mutant procollagen in OI64 and OI26 was provided by experiments demonstrating that the endoplasmic reticulum resident molecular chaperone BiP, which binds to malfolded proteins, was specifically bound to type I procollagen and was coimmunoprecipitated in the osteogenesis imperfecta cells but not control cells. Experiments with brefeldin A, which inhibits protein export from the endoplasmic reticulum, demonstrated that unassembled mutant proα1(I) chains were selectively degraded within the endoplasmic reticulum resulting in reduced collagen production by the osteogenesis imperfecta cells. This biosynthetic deficiency was reflected in the inability of OI64 and OI26 cells to produce a substantial in vitro collagenous matrix when grown in the continuous presence of ascorbic acid to allow collagen matrix formation. Both these carboxyl-terminal propeptide mutants showed a marked reduction in collagen accumulation to 20% (or less) of control cultures, comparable to the reduced collagen content of tissues from OI26.

The mutations include insertions, deletions, gene rearrangements and, most commonly, point mutations in the triple helical domains of the α1(I) and α2(I) chains. These substitutions interrupt the obligatory Gly- X-Y repeat sequence and compromise the structural integrity of the helix. Mutations outside the helical domain, in the carboxyl-terminal propeptides, are infrequent but demonstrate the critical role of these regions in directing chain assembly, trimerization, and the initiation of helix formation. The severity of OI resulting from carboxyl-terminal propeptide mutations is dependent on the extent to which the mutations compromise procollagen assembly. Two frameshift mutations, one in proα1(I) and the other in proα2(I), completely prevented incorporation of the mutant proα-chains into type I procollagen heterotrimers resulting in a “functionally null” allele and consequently relatively mild clinical phenotypes (3Willing M.C.

While the heterozygotes for the COL1A1 mutation had OI type I, patients heterozygous for the COL1A2 frameshift mutation were clinically normal, but the homozygote had a moderate OI type III phenotype.

To further characterize the biosynthetic consequences of carboxyl-terminal propeptide mutations, procollagen molecular assembly, intracellular degradation, secretion, and accumulation in the extracellular matrix were examined in this cell strain (OI64) and also in OI26 cells, where a frameshift mutation produced a change in the amino acid sequence beginning at residue 106 of the carboxyl-terminal propeptide and resulted in a truncated chain (5Bateman J.F.

In both cell strains intermolecular carboxyl-terminal propeptide disulfide-bond formation was disturbed, and procollagen assembly was slowed. Furthermore, the endoplasmic reticulum-resident molecular chaperone BiP was induced and bound to type I procollagen in both cell strains. Although mutant proα1(I) chains were degraded within the endoplasmic reticulum, degradation was not complete and some abnormal, overmodified molecules were secreted by both OI cell lines. The formation of a collagenous matrix by the OI cells was evaluated in an in vitro culture system where cells were incubated for extended periods in the presence of ascorbate, leading to the deposition and maturation of an extensive collagen matrix in control cell cultures. As a consequence of defective molecular assembly and increased intracellular degradation both cell strains showed a dramatic collagen matrix deficiency. The first infant (OI64), was delivered at 38 weeks gestation and died within 24 h. The ribs contained healing fractures and the long bones showed numerous metaphyseal and diaphyseal fractures but were not as wide and crumpled in appearance as observed in many cases of OI type II (8Sillence D.O.

In some experiments the ascorbic acid was replaced with 0.1 m Mα,α′-dipyridyl to prevent the post-translational modification of proline and lysine residues, or 100 ng/ml brefeldin A (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to prevent transport of secretory proteins out of the endoplasmic reticulum (14Klausner R.D.

Procollagens and collagens were precipitated with 25% saturated (NH4)2SO4 and resuspended in 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl, and proteinase inhibitors. Aliquots of procollagens were precipitated with 75% (v/v) ethanol and converted to collagen by limited pepsin digestion (100 μg/ml pepsin in 0.5 M acetic acid, 4°C, 16 h). For the pulse-chase analysis of procollagen assembly, confluent cultures were incubated overnight in medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 0.25 m M ascorbic acid, preincubated for 2 h in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.25 m M ascorbic acid, then labeled with 250 μCi/ml L-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline (114 Ci/mmol, NEN Research Products). After 30 min the medium was removed, the cells were washed with medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 0.25 m M ascorbic acid, and 10 m M proline, and then incubated in this chase medium for up to 6 h. Cell layer procollagens were harvested in the presence of 20 m M iodoacetamide to prevent further disulfide bond formation and were precipitated with 30% (v/v) ethanol (15Starman B.J. Eyre D.

In some experiments 100 ng/ml brefeldin A was included during the preincubation, labeling, and chase periods. For biosynthetic labeling with [35S]methionine, the cells were rinsed in methionine-deficient medium and then incubated for 3 h in methionine-deficient medium supplemented with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). Cells were lysed in an ATP-depleting non-ionic detergent buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 m M NaCl, 50 m M Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 8 units/ml hexokinase (Sigma), 11 m M glucose, and 24 units/ml apyrase (Sigma)). After 30 min on ice, iodoacetamide (30 m M, final) was added to the lysates, and they were centrifuged briefly to remove nuclei and insoluble material. Aliquots of cell extract were diluted with lysis buffer, primary antibody was added, and samples mixed by end-over-end rotation. After 1-2 h, protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia) was added to the reactions, and they were mixed for several hours more. The beads were washed three times, 30 min each time, first in 50% lysis buffer and 50% NET buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 m M NaCl, 1 m M EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), then twice with NET buffer. Precipitated protein complexes were examined by SDS-PAGE. To verify the position of BiP, cell extracts from fibroblasts treated overnight with tunicamycin (5 μg/ml) and labeled as above with [35S]methionine were loaded on most gels (16Kozutsumi Y. Segal M.

Santi L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Procollagen and collagen chains were resolved on 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide separating gels with a 3.5% (w/v) stacking gel. Sample preparation, electrophoresis conditions, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and fluorography of radioactive gels have been described elsewhere (5Bateman J.F. Chan D. Mascara T. Rogers J.G.

J. 1984; 217: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Coomassie-stained bands were quantitated by densitometry in comparison to standard collagen samples loaded on each gel. The radioactivity in the procollagen and collagen bands was measured by scintillation counting of excised bands (19Bateman J.F. Harley V. Chan D. Cole W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Procollagen chains labeled in culture or produced by cell-free translation of mRNA were also analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (20Cole W.G. Chan D. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) which resolves the chains on the basis of both charge and size. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred from 5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose filters (BA85, Schleicher and Schuell). Bound LF-41 antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A (Bio-Rad) and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Total RNA was purified from OI64 fibroblasts (21Wake S.A. Mercer J.F.B. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and hybridized to a 672-bp XhoI- EcoRI fragment of the α1(I) cDNA clone Hf677 (22Bernard M.P. Chu M.-L. Myers J.C. Ramirez F.

Heteroduplex formation, hydroxylamine and piperidine treatment, and electrophoretic analysis were performed as described previously (6Bateman J.F. Lamande S.R. Dahl H.-H. Chan D. Mascara T. Cole W.G.

PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1989: 31-38Crossref Google Scholar) and the region of the COL1A1 gene containing the mutation amplified through 30 cycles by the PCR using the primers 5′-TACTGGATTGACCCCAACCA-3′ and 5′-TGGTAGGTGATGTTCTGGGA-3′ and Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus). The 575-bp amplification product was gel purified and sequenced directly using the 5′ PCR primer (25Bachmann B. Luke W. Hunsmann G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). OI64 and control fibroblasts were grown to confluence then supplemented daily with 0.25 m M ascorbic acid for 3 days to maximize type I collagen mRNA levels (26Chan D. Lamande S.R. Cole W.G. Bateman J.F. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted and dilutions dotted onto duplicate nitrocellulose membranes. cDNA probes for α1(I) (Hf677, 22Bernard M.P. Chu M.-L. Myers J.C. Ramirez F. Eikenberry E.F. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5213-5223Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and α2(I) (Hf32, 27Bernard M.P. Myers J.C. Chu M.-L. Ramirez F. Eikenberry E.F. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) by nick translation and the filters hybridized, washed, and specific hybridization quantified as described previously (28Bateman J.F. Chan D. Lamande S. Mascara T. Cole W.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 543: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The mutation deleted a RsaI site which allowed PCR products derived from the normal and mutant alleles to be discriminated. Total RNA from two separate preparations was amplified by 25 PCR cycles using the same primers and conditions used for the genomic DNA PCR. Two aliquots from each reaction were diluted 1:10 in fresh PCR buffer and subjected to a final cycle in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The products were digested with RsaI, separated on an 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the radioactivity in each band quantitated by excision and scintillation counting. The final cycle eliminated heteroduplexes which are resistant to restriction enzyme digestion and commonly form during later PCR cycles when amplification has plateaued (29Becker-Andre M. Hahlbrock K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9437-9446Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Cell-free translation of control and OI26 mRNA was performed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) labeling with L-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline. When unhydroxylated procollagens, produced by labeling cells in the presence of α,α′-dipyridyl, were analyzed without reduction, the proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains in the control were linked by disulfide bonds and migrated near the top of the gel (Fig. 1, lane 2). In the OI26 and OI64 samples, there was an additional band which had a similar migration to reduced proα1(I) chains (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 6). This band was identified as a proα(I) chain by immunoblotting with LF-41, an antibody which specifically recognizes the last 21 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of proα1(I) (Fig. 1, lane 10). This suggested that, as in OI26 where an α1(I) carboxyl-terminal propeptide mutation had been characterized previously, proα1(I) chains from OI64 contained a mutation which interfered with chain association and the formation of interchain disulfide bonds. Unreduced proα1(I) monomers migrated faster than fully reduced proα1(I) indicating the presence of internal disulfide bonds (30Kosen P.A. Franzblau C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4278-4284Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The mutation was initially detected and localized by chemical modification and cleavage of heteroduplexes formed between mRNA extracted from OI64 fibroblasts and a control α1(I) 672 bp XhoI- EcoRI cDNA probe which spanned the majority of the carboxyl-terminal propeptide. Hydroxylamine/piperidine treatment resulted in cleavage of the probe and the production of a 251-bp fragment (data not shown) indicating the presence of a mismatched C in the probe in the region coding for preproα1(I) tryptophan 1312 (carboxyl-terminal propeptide residue 94). To define the mutation, genomic DNA from the patient and from the parents was amplified by the PCR and sequenced directly. The patient was heterozygous for a single base change in exon 49 that converted the codon for amino acid 1312 from tryptophan (TGG) to cysteine (TGT). The mutation was not present in either of the phenotypically normal parents (data not shown). Because the mutation deleted a RsaI restriction site in cDNA we could assess the effect of the mutation on mRNA expression. The normal transcript represented an average of 54% of the total α1(I) mRNA indicating that the mutation did not measurably affect steady-state mRNA levels. This was further confirmed by comparing the levels of proα1(I) and proα2(I) mRNA. In control cells the α1(I)/α2(I) ratio was 1.47 ± 0.08 (mean ± S.D., n = 8) compared with 1.46 in OI64 cells (average of determinations on mRNA preparations from two separate cultures). These values were not corrected for the probe size and specific activity. To characterize the effect of the point mutation in OI64 and a frameshift mutation in OI26 (6Bateman J.F. Lamande S.R. Dahl H.-H. Chan D. Mascara T. Cole W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10960-10964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on interchain disulfide bond formation and molecular assembly, control, OI64, and OI26 cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min and then chased for up to 6 h prior to analysis of the procollagen by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. In control cells almost all of the proα1(I) chains were incorporated into disulfide-linked trimers by 40 min of chase (Fig. 2 a). In contrast, monomeric proα1(I) chains were present in OI64 cells for more than 120 min and in OI26 cells even after 6 h of chase (Fig. 2, c and d) indicating that the mutations slowed the formation of interchain disulfide bonds. In control cells monomeric proα2(I) chains disappeared more slowly than free proα1(I) chains, after 1-2 h of chase, suggesting that they were synthesized in excess (Fig. 2 a). The excess synthesis of proα2(I) chains relative to proα1(I) was highlighted when brefeldin A was included during the preincubation, pulse labeling, and chase periods. Brefeldin A is a fungal metabolite which inhibits protein secretion by causing the cis-Golgi to fuse with the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing further protein transport (14Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). While proα1(I) chain disulfide-bonding may have been slightly slowed in the presence of brefeldin A, incorporation of proα1(I) monomers into disulfide-bonded trimers was complete by 60 min of chase (Fig. 2 b), and the most obvious effect of brefeldin A was to almost completely prevent the disappearance of undisulfide-bonded proα2(I) chains. These chains migrated more slowly with increasing chase time consistent with the proposal that they were excess non-helical subunits and continued to be substrates for post-translational enzymatic hydroxylation and glycosylation (31Berg R.A. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3395-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Intracellular accumulation of proα2(I) chains was also observed when control, OI64, and OI26 cells were continuously labeled for 18 h in the presence of brefeldin A. About 25% of the total proα2(I) chains from control cells migrated as undisulfide-bonded monomers when exit from the endoplasmic reticulum was blocked by brefeldin A (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2); however, in brefeldin A-treated OI64 cells, undisulfide-bonded proα2(I) chains represented a larger proportion, about 40%, of the total proα2(I) (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, brefeldin A-treated OI64 cells did not accumulate extra undisulfide-bonded proα1(I) chains; approximately 10% of the proα1(I) chains migrated as monomers in both α,α′-dipyridyl and brefeldin A-treated OI64 cells (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6; Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). OI26 cells exhibited a similar pattern of intracellular procollagen chain accumulation. Brefeldin A-treated OI26 cells accumulated excess undisulfide-bonded proα2(I) chains to a greater extent than control cells (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6), while the proportion of undisulfide-bonded proα1(I) chains was not increased compared with α,α′-dipyridyl-treated OI26 cells (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4; Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). This pattern of additional proα2(I) accumulation by brefeldin A-treated OI26 and OI64 cells was consistent in three separate experiments. The extra accumulation of excess, monomeric proα2(I) chains in brefeldin A-treated OI26 and OI64 cells when compared to control cells suggested that relatively fewer proα1(I) chains were available for assembly with proα2(I) subunits in the OI cells probably because of increased intracellular proα1(I) degradation. The frameshift mutation in OI26 results in the synthesis of a more basic proα1(I) chain which is 37 amino acids shorter than normal. Mutant and normal OI26 proα1(I) chains were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, which separates proteins on the basis of both charge and size, and this allowed the intracellular fate of these chains to be directly compared (Fig. 4). The identity of proα1(I) chains was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). Mutant and normal proα1(I) chains were almost equally abundant in samples produced by cell-free translation of fibroblast mRNA (Fig. 4 b) indicating that the steady-state levels of normal and mutant mRNA were similar. In contrast, the mutant chain was significantly reduced relative to normal proα1(I) in cells labeled for 18 h in the presence of α,α′-dipyridyl (Fig. 4 d), demonstrating that it was selectively degraded. Degradation of the mutant proα1(I) chain was not inhibited by brefeldin A (Fig. 4 f) consistent with an endoplasmic reticulum-localized degradation pathway. Normal and abnormal OI64 proα1(I) carboxyl-terminal propeptides could not be resolved on two-dimensional isoelectric focusing gels (data not shown) so it was not possible to determine the relative proportions of normal and mutant proα1(I) chains remaining in the cells in these experiments. The endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein BiP has been shown to bind to malfolded secretory proteins (32Gething M.-J. McCammon K. Sambrook J. Cell. 1986; 46: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). When type I procollagen was immunoprecipitated with an antibody to its carboxyl-terminal propeptide (that recognizes both normal and abnormal procollagen molecules), BiP coprecipitated in extracts from OI64 and OI26 cells but not from control cells (Fig. 5), demonstrating BiP binding to the abnormal procollagen produced by the OI cells. BiP has ATPase activity and, in vitro, dissociates from proteins to which it is bound in the presence of ATP and Mg2+ (33Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 291-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 34Kassenbrock C.K. Kelly R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). When immunoprecipitated type I procollagen from OI64 and OI26 cells was incubated with ATP, BiP was released from the precipitated protein complex, (Fig. 5, a, d, and e), verifying the specificity of BiP-proα chain binding in both OI26 and OI64. BiP synthesis increased in both OI64 and OI26 cells after the addition of ascorbate to the culture medium. After 20-24 h of ascorbate treatment, BiP protein content was substantially greater in OI64 and OI26 cells than in control cells (data not shown). To further compare the fate of proα1(I) chains with mutations in the carboxyl-terminal propeptide domain, collagens from OI26 and OI64 were biosynthetically labeled with [3H]proline and aliquots from the medium were examined for the presence of und"

The cold-induced protein has been isolated, characterized by amino acid sequencing, and pulse labeled with radioactive precursors, showing that it is the product of post-translational modification by phosphorylation of the minor chlorophyll a/b protein CP29 rather than the product of a cold-regulated gene or an unprocessed CP29 precursor. We show here that the CP29 kinase activity displays unique characteristics differing from previously described thylakoid kinases and is regulated by the redox state of a quinonic site. Finally, we show that maize plants unable to perform phosphorylation have enhanced sensitivity to cold-induced photoinhibition.

In the photosynthetic apparatus of higher plants, the efficiency of the electron transport and light-harvesting functions is regulated in response to environmental and metabolic conditions. The earliest described mechanism is the state I-state II transition and consists of the phosphorylation-induced redistribution of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) 1The abbreviations used are:LHCIIlight-harvesting complex IIPSIIphotosystem IIPSIphotosystem IRCreaction centerDMdodecyl maltosideDCMU3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylureaDBMIB2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl- p-benzoquinoneHPLChighpressure liquid chromatographyμEmicroeinsteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are:LHCIIlight-harvesting complex IIPSIIphotosystem IIPSIphotosystem IRCreaction centerDMdodecyl maltosideDCMU3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylureaDBMIB2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl- p-benzoquinoneHPLChighpressure liquid chromatographyμEmicroeinsteinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.(1Allen J.F.

A second mechanism has been described for the thermal dissipation of the excitation energy excess. This process is dependent on the deepoxidation of the xanthophyll violaxanthin to zeaxanthin (3Demmig-Adams B. Biochim. Biophys.

Recently, a new regulatory process has been reported that is elicited by strongly photoinhibitory conditions such as those produced by illumination of maize plants at low temperature. Under these conditions, a new thylakoid protein appears in cold-resistant cultivars and is absent from cold-sensitive plants. While the protein has been isolated and characterized as a chlorophyll a/b protein located close to the PSII reaction center (RC), its origin is still unclear. 2Mauro, S., Dainese, P., and Bassi, R., submitted for publication. 2Mauro, S., Dainese, P., and Bassi, R., submitted for publication. In particular, it is not known whether the cold-induced SDS-PAGE band is the product of a previously silent lhcb gene or a post-translational modification of an existing chlorophyll protein such as CP29, with which it shares epitopes (6Hayden D.B. Baker N.R. Percival M.P. Beckwith P.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 86-92Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Hayden D.B. Covello P.S. Baker N.R. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 15: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and pigment composition.2In this study, we have characterized the cold-induced protein by amino acid sequencing and pulse-chase with radioactive precursors, showing that it is the result of CP29 phosphorylation. Moreover, we report that this phosphorylation induces a change in the CP29 conformation and that the kinase activity is controlled by a quinonic site closely associated to photosystem II RC. Finally, we show that maize plants unable to perform CP29 phosphorylation are more sensitive to photoinhibition. This is the first report of CP29 phosphorylation and suggests that the reversible modification of membrane-intrinsic, chlorophyll a/b binding proteins can be a mechanism for the modulation of light harvesting and excitation energy transfer to the reaction center. Zea mays seedlings (cvs. Adon, DK300, Oh7N, and H93, supplied by Dekalb Co., IL) were grown for 2 weeks in a growth chamber at 28/21°C day/night at a light intensity of 200 μE m−2 s−1 and 80% humidity. Leaves from 2-week-old plants were harvested at the end of a 6-h illumination period at 25 or 4°C, and thylakoids from mesophyll chloroplasts were prepared as previously described (8Bassi R. H-Hansen G. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Simpson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PSII membranes (BBY particles) were obtained according to the method of Berthold et al. (9Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1650) Google Scholar) with the modification described in Ref. 10Dunahay T.G. Staehelin L.A. Seibert M. Ogilvie P.D. Berg S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 764: 179-193Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar. Aliquots were suspended in 50 m M Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 5 m M MgCl2, 50% glycerol and frozen at −80°C until required. Membrane yield was determined by measuring chlorophyll content in 80% acetone, using the equations of Porra et al. (11Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4660) Google Scholar). For the purification of CP29 and CP34 apoproteins, two consecutive preparative SDS-PAGE were used to avoid minor contaminations. The first elecrophoresis was run on a 12-18% polyacrylamide gradient gel containing 6 M urea with the Tris/sulfate buffer system, as previously described (8Bassi R. H-Hansen G. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Simpson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bands were excised and rerun on a second gel of uniform polyacrylamide concentration (10%) without urea in the Tris/tricine buffer (12Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional electrophoresis was performed using the non-denaturing Deriphat-PAGE (on a 5-12% polyacrylamide gradient gel) (13Santini C. Tidu V. Tognon G. Ghiretti Magaldi A. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) for the first dimension and the SDS-urea-PAGE (9-16% gradient gel) according to Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar), with double buffer concentration for the second dimension. Individual spots in the two-dimensional gels were identified by immunoblotting with specific antibodies as previously described (13Santini C. Tidu V. Tognon G. Ghiretti Magaldi A. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One-dimensional electrophoresis was always performed by the Tris/sulfate, 6 M urea system mentioned above. For immunoblot assays, samples were separated by PAGE and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Hoefer). Filters were then probed with α-CP29 antibodies, and antibody binding was detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated α-rabbit IgG (Boehringer Mannheim). Antibodies were raised in rabbits, using poly(A)˙poly(U) as adjuvant, and characterized as previously described (15Di Paolo M.L. Dal Belin Peruffo A. Bassi R. Planta. 1990; 181: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The samples were purified by SDS-PAGE as described above and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) (17Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were then visualized by staining with 0.2% Ponceau S in 2% acetic acid. The bands of interest were excised and digested 24 h with trypsin in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate containing 5 m M calcium chloride and 8% acetonitrile. The resulting tryptic fragments were first purified by utilizing an ABI 130 HPLC and an aquapore RP-300 column equilibrated with 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, followed by a 17-min linear gradient from 0 to 40% acetonitrile. Individual peaks were then rechromatographed using the same column equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and a linear gradient from 0 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.07% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems model 475A sequencer equipped with an “on line” model 120A PTH amino acid analyzer. Maize seedlings of 2-week-old plants were cut under water at the base of their epicotyl and quickly immersed into 0.5 ml of 40 m M Hepes/KOH (pH 7.5), in small glass vials (height, 40 mm; diameter, 5 mm). 300 μCi of [35S]methionine or 200 μCi of [33P]orthophosphoric acid were added to each vial, and seedlings were allowed to incorporate radioactivity for 3 h at 25°C in the light, with the evaporative demand increased by cool air from a hair drier. When solutions became low during this period, 40 m M Hepes/KOH was added to each vial. Following incorporation, seedlings were kept in the light for 6 h at either 4 or 25°C. Leaves, apart from the first one, were then cut, and thylakoids were immediately prepared as described (8Bassi R. H-Hansen G. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Simpson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometry of the relative Coomassie-stained gels (treated with EN3HANCE™ autoradiography enhancer, DuPont NEN) and autoradiographs (Hyperfilm-βmax Amersham films) were performed with a Bio-Rad GS670 imaging densitometer according to the company's protocol. Thylakoid membranes (25 μg of chlorophyll) were washed once in 5 m M EDTA, 10 m M Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, and resuspended in 0.1% DM, 10 m M Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, at a chlorophyll concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Proteolytic digestion was carried out at 37 or 25°C for 30 min by addition of chymotrypsin to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 volume of solubilization buffer (containing 6 M urea, 5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol), and the fragments were loaded on a 12% acrylamide gel using the Tris/tricine system. Membranes, in aliquots of 5 μg of chlorophyll, were suspended in 50 m M Tris/HCl (pH 7.0 or 8.5) and incubated with 0.5 units of alkaline phosphatase (type VII-SA, Sigma) at 30°C. Where indicated, membranes were previously washed twice in 50 m M Tricine, pH 7.8, 5 m M EDTA, and/or MgCl2was added to the sample to a final concentration of 5 m M. After incubation, the reactions were stopped by addition of the solubilization buffer; samples were boiled for 2 min and loaded onto the gel. The cultivars Oh7N and H93 were grown exactly in the same conditions described for the preparation of thylakoid membranes, in a Haereus growth cabinet at a light intensity of 300 μE m−2 s−1. Changes in chlorophyll fluorescence yield were measured using a commercial pulsed fluorimeter (PAM 2000, Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) with the light guide that delivers the measuring and saturating light held at 5 mm from the upper side of the third maize leaf. The leaf was fixed on a copper support while still in the pot in a cold room. For the photoinhibitory treatment at 4°C, strong white light (1000 μE m−2 s−1 at the surface of the leaf) was delivered by a cold light illuminator (KL1500 electronic, Schott, France). The temperature of the leaf (measured by a thermocouple) could be rapidly changed from 4 to 25°C. The minimum (Fo) and maximum (Fm) fluorescence yield in the dark, and the ratio (Fm - Fo)/Fm = Fν/Fm, which reflects the potential yield of the photochemical reaction of photosystem II (18Krause G.H. Physiol. Plant. 1988; 74: 566-574Crossref Scopus (751) Google Scholar) was recorded at 25°C before each chilling period. The standard protocol consisted of four periods of 2 h of light at 4°C, separated by 15 min of dark at 25°C. During this dark period, that part of non-photochemical quenching not related to photoinhibition could relax (19Hodges M. Cornic G. Briantais J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 289-293Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After the last photoinhibitory treatment, the plants were allowed to recover at 25°C for 15 h, and the fluorescence parameters were measured again (24 h after the first measurements). When maize leaves are chilled in the light, a new SDS-PAGE band appears at a position corresponding to 34 kDa. The process is completely reversible upon recovery at room temperature for 1 h (Fig. 1). This protein is related to the chlorophyll a/b binding protein CP29, as recognized by immunological cross-reaction (6Hayden D.B. Baker N.R. Percival M.P. Beckwith P.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 86-92Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Hayden D.B. Covello P.S. Baker N.R. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 15: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and spectroscopic analysis of the isolated native protein. This band was called CP34 on the basis of its apparent molecular weight.2The relationship between the CP29 and CP34 proteins is unclear. To assess the origin of this cold-induced thylakoid protein, we first determined the primary sequence of both CP29 and CP34. The 34-kDa polypeptide was purified from thylakoid membranes of cold-treated maize leaves (6 h at 4°C in the presence of high light). Since several thylakoid polypeptides have molecular masses in the 28-35-kDa range, we isolated the protein by two consecutive preparative SDS-PAGE systems to avoid the presence of minor contaminations. The same procedure was applied to CP29. The polypeptides were then blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters and submitted to automated Edman degradation. As they were N-terminally blocked, peptide fragments were generated by limited proteolysis using trypsin. Following digestion, two of the resulting peptides were purified by HPLC and sequenced in the case of CP34, and three peptides were purified and sequenced in the case of CP29. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 2. Fragments I and II of both CP29 and CP34 gave sequences of 32 and 20 amino acids and were identical in the two apoproteins. They matched almost exactly with segments of the protein sequence deduced from the lhcb4 cDNA clone of barley encoding the CAB protein CP29 (20Morishige D.T. Thornber J.P. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The two stretches of residues span, respectively, amino acids 102-131 and 212-231 of the barley apoprotein precursor. Only few differences could be observed for fragments I and II, as shown in Fig. 2. Fragment III, sequenced only for CP29, differed more from the corresponding segment of its barley counterpart, especially at its N-terminal side (see Fig. 2). These results show that the two SDS-PAGE bands recognized by the α-CP29 antibodies in cold-treated maize thylakoids are the products of genes very similar if not identical to lhcb4. As far as the sequence analysis, CP29 and CP34 are identical. In Vivo Labeling of Thylakoid Proteins with [35S]Methionine-In the light of the above results, we could then address questions on the biogenesis of CP34, i.e. whether it was (a) the product of an alternative splicing of the lhcb4 gene transcript, (b) the unprocessed precursor of CP29, or (c) a post-translationally modified CP29. The first two hypotheses imply that the cold-induced protein is synthesized de novo following cold stress, while a post-translational modification would act on a protein already existing in the thylakoids. To test these possibilities, we examined the patterns of thylakoid proteins synthesized at 25 and 4°C in the presence of light. We labeled plastid proteins in vivo by feeding [35S]methionine to seedlings. Maize seedlings, loaded with [35S]methionine for 3 h at 25°C, were then incubated for 6 h at either 25 or 4°C under 200 μE m−2 s−1 illumination. Following this treatment, thylakoids were isolated from mesophyll chloroplasts, and their polypeptide content was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Membranes were first fractionated on non-denaturing Deriphat-PAGE (13Santini C. Tidu V. Tognon G. Ghiretti Magaldi A. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Peter G.F. Thornber J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then by SDS-urea-PAGE in the second dimension. This combined electrophoretic system allowed a clear-cut separation of CP29 from the D1 apoprotein, a PSII core component comigrating with CP29, which is known to have a very fast turnover, and was therefore expected to be heavily labeled (22Mattoo A.K. Hoffman-Falk H. Marder J.B. Edelman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1380-1384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Greenberg B.M. Gaba V. Mattoo A.K. Edelman M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2865-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As for their amino acid content, CP29 and D1 proteins, respectively, contain 3 and 12 methionines in their primary sequences in barley (20Morishige D.T. Thornber J.P. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Efimov V.A. Andreeva A.V. Reverdatto S.V. Jung R. Chakhmakhcheva O.G.

Fig. 3, a and b, show the results of this analysis. In particular, it was clear that the chilling treatment did not cause de novo synthesis of the CP34 protein, since the labeling of this polypeptide was as low as that of CP29 on a protein quantity basis, as determined by densitometry of gels and relative autoradiographs. The low [35S]methionine incorporation in CP34 following induction by cold shows that this polypeptide is neither the precursor of CP29 nor the product of an alternative splicing of the lhcb4 maize messenger, since both cases imply de novo synthesis and consequent incorporation of radioactivity. The autoradiographic pattern was very similar in chilled and control samples. However, incorporation in all of the polypeptides was lower in the cold-exposed plants as a result of the effect of low temperature on protein synthesis (26Greer D.H. Berry J.A. Björkman O. Planta. 1986; 168: 253-260PubMed Google Scholar, 27quist G. Greer D.H. gren E. Kyle D.J. Osmond B. Arntzen D.J. Topics in Photosynthesis. Vol. 9. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 67-97Google Scholar). The D1 protein is an exception to this rule; its labeling was higher in the cold-treated membranes, consistent with the photoinhibitory conditions applied (28Kyle D.J. Ohad I. Arntzen C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4070-4074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schuster G. Timberg R. Ohad I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We then checked the remaining hypothesis, aiming at identifying the specific post-translational modification of CP29. It has been already reported that the cold-induced polypeptide is not glycosylated (7Hayden D.B. Covello P.S. Baker N.R. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 15: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, the putative modification appeared to be rapidly inducible and reversible. This was shown by the rate of appearance of the 34-kDa band on exposing leaves to chilling and high light,2as well as the rate of degradation of the polypeptide on returning leaves to 25°C (7Hayden D.B. Covello P.S. Baker N.R. Photosynth. Res. 1988; 15: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These kinetics are consistent with a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism that could also explain the electrophoretic upshift, a behavior common to other phosphoproteins (30Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation of the purified, non-denatured form of the CP29 protein by various kinases was not successful (not shown). We then proceeded to in vivo labeling of maize leaves with H333PO4. The radioactive phosphate was fed to excised seedlings as described for [35S]methionine. Seedlings were then exposed to chilling treatment in the light, and thylakoid membranes were analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE and autoradiography. The results are shown in Fig. 3 c; CP34, but not CP29, was heavily labeled. The two-dimensional analysis allowed a sharp distinction between CP34 and the phosphorylated form of the D2 apoprotein, which comigrate in one-dimensional PAGE. In the autoradiograph, all of the known major thylakoid phosphoproteins (31Bennet J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 281-311Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 32Allen J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar) could be identified: the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins (three between 28 and 30 kDa) (8Bassi R. H-Hansen G. Barbato R. Giacometti G.M. Simpson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13333-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the four proteins of the PSII core CP43 (43 kDa), D2 (34 kDa), D1 (32 kDa), and the 9-kDa product of the psbH gene (not visible in the figure but evident at the lower edge of the gel in the original film). Apart from CP34, the autoradiographic pattern of control and cold-treated samples also differed with respect to the relative intensity of the labeling of the other subunits; LHCII apoproteins were more heavily phosphorylated in the cold-treated samples by a factor of 2.5, as determined by densitometry of the film. Moreover, labeling of the PSII core subunits CP43, D1, D2, and 9 kDa was barely detectable in the control sample, while it was very strong in the cold-treated one. It is worth noting that only the PSII core subunits deriving from the monomeric form of the complex are phosphorylated, while those associated to the dimeric form are not. When we performed the above experiment with maize lines, which produce very little or any CP34 upon cold stress in the light, essentially no differences were observed in the phosphorylation pattern apart from the lower labeling of the CP34 band (not shown). Which is the effect of the phosphorylation on CP29? Protein phosphorylation has been shown to be one of the most general mechanisms in the regulation of protein function through changes in their conformational state (30Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To verify if this is also the case for CP29, we analyzed the two proteins by limited proteolysis at 37 and 25°C. Control and cold-treated membranes were partially solubilized with 0.1% DM and digested with chymotrypsin. The results of the proteolytic treatment (identical at the two temperatures) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 4). It was shown that the digestion produced different patterns in the two samples; the smaller fragment detected (about 16 kDa) was more abundant in the control membranes, while an additional 23-kDa band appeared in the cold-treated sample containing CP34. This may indicate that at least one proteolytic site was protected in the phosphorylated form of the protein due to a conformational change induced by the phosphorylation. Similar results, in fact, were obtained with other endoproteinases cutting at different sites (not shown), ruling out the possibility that the added phosphate group could sterically constrain proteolysis at a nearby target site. As shown above, the phosphorylation of CP29 is accompanied by a change of its mobility in SDS-urea-PAGE possibly due to changes in the secondary structure of the polypeptide in the gel, owing to the addition of the highly charged phosphate group. It can be asked whether the change of electrophoretic mobility is exclusively due to phosphorylation or if other modifications such as aggregation with surrounding small peptides are involved, similar to the case of D1 and the cytochrome b559 α-subunits (33Barbato R. Friso G. Rigoni F. Frizzo A. Giacometti G.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To clarify this point, we treated thylakoid membranes containing CP34 with phosphatase enzymes in vitro. Both acidic and alkaline phosphatases were used, and the former was less active than the latter at neutral pH (not shown). When treated with alkaline phosphatase at pH 7.00, the CP34 band, detected by immunoblotting, disappears, indicating that the change in mobility is only due to phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A). Surprisingly, the dephosphorylation was shown to be slower at higher pH, 8.5 versus 7.0, closer to the alkaline phosphatase optimum. Moreover, the addition of the mild detergent DM increases the dephosphorylation rate at both pH values, thus suggesting that external (stromal) pH changes may induce differences in the accessibility of the phosphorylation site. We designed an experiment to ascertain if the domain of the antenna complex involved in phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events was exposed on the stromal or lumenal site of the membrane. Thylakoids and PSII membranes (BBY particles), exposing, respectively, the stromal and the lumenal domains of the polypeptide to the solvent, were used. When thylakoids were treated with alkaline phosphatase, dephosphorylation was more effective if membranes were previously destacked by EDTA washing to increase the accessibility to the stromal surface of grana membranes. Dephosphorylation was more efficient when alkaline phosphatase was added before restacking with Mg2+. Accordingly, the treatment of BBY particles was ineffective. These results, shown in Fig. 5B, indicate that the phosphorylation site is most probably exposed on the stromal side of the membrane in the stacked domain. Previous work on thylakoid kinases showed that the activity of the LHCII-specific enzyme is controlled by the redox state of the plastoquinone pool, thus acting in the regulation of the electron transport between PSII and PSI (1Allen J.F. Bennet J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 25-29Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Activation of the kinase appears to be dependent on the formation of a complex with the cytochrome b6 /f (34Gal A. Hauska G. Herrmann R. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19742-19749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Frid D. Gal A. Oettmeier W. Hauska G. Berger S. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25908-25915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the effect of blocking the photosynthetic electron transport chain at different sites. This was performed by using a mutated line and treatments with chemical inhibitors. In a first approach, we blocked electron transport by depleting CO2, the terminal electron acceptor of photosynthesis; seedlings were illuminated in N2atmosphere for 10 min at room temperature. Thylakoids were then isolated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with α-CP29 polyclonals, showing that the phosphorylated form of CP29 was induced in those conditions even without cold treatment (Fig. 6, panel A, lane c). This suggests that phosphorylation is activated by the reduction of a component of the electron transport chain. Further insights were obtained by comparing the wild type with hcf2 mutant seedlings lacking cytochrome b6 /f (36Metz J.G. Miles D. Rutherford A.W. Plant Physiol. 1983; 73: 452-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this mutant, CP34 was present following illumination, even at room temperature (lanes f and g). 20 μM DCMU was used to block electron transport between PSII reaction center and plastoquinone. This treatment completely prevented CP29 phosphorylation in both wild type and hcf2 mutant whether at 4°C or room temperature (lane"

Nukiwa T. Takabe K. Takahashi H. Miyake K. Kira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12627-12632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are associated with a deficiency of the inhibitor in the blood and its partial retention within the endoplasmic reticulum of synthesizing hepatocytes. Recent evidence indicates that this retention is accompanied by polymerization of the abnormal protein by the process of loop-sheet linkage in which the reactive center loop of one molecule inserts into a β-pleated sheet of another (4Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 5Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The mutation in Z α1-antitrypsin, Glu342→ Lys, occurs at the junction of strand 5 of the six-membered sheet A of the molecule (6Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) with the base of the mobile loop. This alteration in the hinge region is thought to interfere with normal refolding of the reactive center into the A sheet, thus favoring intermolecular loop insertion with the sequential formation of loop-sheet polymers (5Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.-S. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The A sheet polymerization model is also compatible with structural studies on α1-antitrypsin Siiyamain which a Ser53→ Phe mutation is predicted to cause an opening of the A sheet between strands s3A and s5A (7Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stein P. Chothia C. J. Mol.

Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) suggest a related but more complex process may be involved in the loop-sheet polymerization of the serpins. The structure of a dimer of antithrombin shows one molecule in the latent form in which the reactive loop is totally incorporated into the A sheet of the molecule. This releases a strand from the C sheet and it is this strand that is replaced by the reactive loop of the second molecule in the dimer. This alternative mechanism of C sheet polymerization is not incompatible with the A sheet model, since the common first step in either polymerization process would be increased rate of refolding of the loop into the A sheet. Here we examine the comparative secretion of M, Z, and Siiyamaα1-antitrypsins from Xenopus oocytes to further explore the link between loop-sheet interactions and defects in secretion. Yu and colleagues (11Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have identified a mutation, Phe51→ Leu, which stabilizes α1-antitrypsin against polymerization, predictably by locking its A sheet in the closed position. In particular we examine the secretion of this mutant α1-antitrypsin and of its chimer with Z α1-antitrypsin (Phe51→ Leu/Glu342→ Lys) and Siiyamaα1-antitrypsin (Phe51→ Leu/Ser53→ Phe) to establish whether, as predicted, stabilization of the A sheet will prevent the polymerization that otherwise occurs in these variants with a consequent failure in protein export. Although the structural and other evidence strongly indicates that the underlying defect in Siiyamais due to an opening of the A sheet allowing the ready formation of polymers, the structural deductions with respect to the Z mutant are more ambivalent. The Z mutation is at residue P17, at the base of the hinge region on which the reactive center loop pivots, and may result in either an opening of the A sheet or an impedance of loop insertion into the sheet. An inhibition of loop folding would be expected to favor polymerization, but if this is so, the mechanism would be that of A sheet rather than C sheet polymerization. We test this possibility here using constructs of M and Z antitrypsin containing replacements in the hinge region designed to constrain loop mobility but which should not effect the mechanism of A sheet opening. The secretory properties of these M and Z chimeric mutants provide evidence as to the mechanism underlying the intracellular polymerization of Z antitrypsin.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Oswel DNA Service, Edinburgh, United Kingdom. Endoglycosidase H (cloned from Streptomyces plicatus) was from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were analytical grade or better and provided by Sigma. Mutants were generated from full-length α1-antitrypsin cDNA (12Ciliberto G. Dente L. Cortese R.

After cooling, 10 μl of 1 milliunit/μl endoglycosidase H containing 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, and samples were digested for 16 h at 37°C (17Trimble R.B. Maley F. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Expression of PiM-, PiZ-, and Siiyama-encoding RNAs in Xenopus oocytes produced a 54-kDa partially glycosylated intracellular form of the inhibitor (Fig. 1) and a 56-kDa secreted protein. However, it was evident from the fluorograph that secretion of normal, M α1-antitrypsin was far greater than that of both Z and Siiyamavariants. The estimated molecular mass of secreted α1-antitrypsin as reported by various authors, ranges over 52-58 kDa, depending on the electrophoretic conditions and molecular mass standards used. Immunoprecipitated protein was treated with endoglycosidase H (18Lodish H.F. Kong N. Snider M. Strous G.J.A.M.

As shown in Fig. 1, the intracellular 54-kDa species was converted to a single band of molecular mass 46 kDa on endoglycosidase H digestion. Intracellular PiZ and Siiyamaproteins were sensitive to digestion, indicating that both mutant proteins are retained in a pre-Golgi compartment, probably the ER. Digestion with the enzyme had no effect on secreted M, Z, and Siiyamaproteins which were terminally glycosylated. To quantify differences in the extent of secretion of α1-antitrypsin PiM, PiZ, and Siiyamabands were excised and counted and the experiment repeated with different batches of oocytes to eliminate, as far as possible, oocyte variation. Fig. 2(open bars) shows the amount of inhibitor secreted expressed as a percentage of the total immunoprecipitable material. Siiyama(13.7% secreted ± 1.2) and Z (10.0% secreted ± 1.0) variants are similarly retained in oocytes whereas M α1-antitrypsin (63.3% secreted ± 3.9) is more readily secreted from these cells during the incubation. The Phe51→ Leu mutant was constructed using polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis of M and Z cDNAs. The double mutant Phe51→ Leu, Ser53→ Phe was constructing using M cDNA as template. The effect of the Phe51→ Leu mutation on M, Z, and Siiyamaantitrypsin secretion is shown in Fig. 2 (hatched bars). A 3-fold enhancement of Z antitrypsin secretion was recorded in the chimer Phe51→ Leu, Glu342→ Lys (28.9% secreted ± 4.2). Moreover, the SiiyamaLeu51chimer was secreted (68.9%±3.1) as efficiently as normal M antitrypsin. Thus the Phe51→ Leu mutation fully restores secretion of the Siiyamavariant to that of the normal phenotype and reduces retention of Z antitrypsin. The 20-residue reactive center loop of α1-antitrypsin extends 15 residues (P15→ P1) amino-terminal and 5 residues (P1′ → P5′) carboxyl-terminal to the reactive center. The influence of residues P14and P11/12(near the base of the loop) on the secretory properties of M and Z antitrypsins was examined by replacing the normal residues with those present in the noninhibitory serpin ovalbumin; namely P14Thr → Arg and P11/12Ala → Val. Fig. 3 displays the extent of secretion of antitrypsin as a percentage of the total immunoprecipitable protein. M P14Arg shows a significant reduction in secretion (41.7%± 2.3) compared with normal M antitrypsin (62.4%± 3.1). No significant difference was observed between Z antitrypsin (12.4%± 1.3) and the Z P14Arg double mutant (13.7%± 1.3). The secretion defect observed with Z antitrypsin is partially corrected if the P11/12alanines are substituted for the larger valine residues as indicated by the increased secretion of Z P11/12Val (25.2%± 2.7) compared with Z antitrypsin. It is now realized that the abnormalities of serpins associated with deficiency have a common molecular pathology in that they can spontaneously undergo a conformational transition which results in partial retention within the endoplasmic pathway and, particularly with α1-antitrypsin, is accompanied by polymer formation. The liver disease in Z homozygotes is coincident with the intracellular retention of polymerized inhibitor in inclusion bodies within the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocytes (2Eriksson S. Larsson C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1975; 292: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Sharp H.L. Hosp. Pract. 1971; 6: 83-96Crossref Google Scholar). Recently another variant, α1-antitrypsin Siiyama, was shown to have the same association with plasma deficiency and the identical histological finding of hepatic inclusions of mutant inhibitor (3Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Takabe K. Takahashi H. Miyake K. Kira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12627-12632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the Z and Siiyamamutants have amino acid substitutions, that although well separated from each other, will theoretically have the same effect, that is to open the A sheet between the third and fifth strands and thus promote the process of loop sheet polymerization (4Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Z and Siiyamaα1-antitrypsin will form long chain polymers with equal facility (7Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Fig. 1 demonstrates that they are secreted from oocytes with comparable efficiency, Z 10.0% and Siiyama13.7% of immunoprecipitable material. In mammalian cells only a small proportion of nonsecreted Z protein accumulates in the ER; the majority is rapidly degraded (20Graham K.S. Le A. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20463-20468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We attempted to measure the degradation of nonsecreted material in oocytes by quantifying α1-antitrypsin before and after the chase incubation. We were unable to detect significant proteolysis, mainly because the slow rate of equilibration of the large intracellular amino acid pool means that labeling continues well into the chase incubation. Other experiments following the fate of retained Z protein in oocytes suggest that little degradation occurs over the time scale of our experiments (21Perlmutter D.H. Kay R.M. Sessions Cole F. Rossing T.H. Van Thiel D. Colten H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6918-6921Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The synthesis of Z antitrypsin does stimulate the activity of a number of lysosomal enzymes in injected oocytes (22Bathurst I.C. Errington D.M. Foreman R.C. Judah J.D. Carrell R.W. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but this response may not facilitate the removal of retained protein since, in mammalian cells, degradation has been shown to occur in a post ER nonlysosomal compartment (23Le A. Graham K.S. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14001-14007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both Z and Siiyamavariants are retained in a similar, if not identical, pre-Golgi compartment within the oocyte as indicated by the pattern of endoglycosidase H digestion. These findings emphasize the link between loop sheet insertion and the secretory block and suggest that, as with Z, the plasma deficiency of the Siiyamavariant can be explained solely in terms of a failure in protein export. We have investigated the phenomenon of loop sheet polymerization by two approaches involving the prevention of entry of the reactive center loop into the A sheet. First, mutations which close the gap between strands s3A and s5A and then mutations in the loop-hinge region which restrict entry into the sheet due to steric hindrance. The Siiyamamutation (Ser53→ Phe) is located in the B helix which underlies the A sheet and provides a surface on which strand s3A slides in order for the sheet to open (8Stein P. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Substitution with a large, aromatic side chain at this position is thought to lock the sheet in the open conformation and thereby promote loop sheet polymerization (7Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stein P. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Recently, Yu and colleagues (11Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that substitution of the Phe residue at position 51 by a small, nonpolar residue such as leucine enhances the thermal stability and decreases heat-induced polymerization of wild type M α1-antitrypsin. Here we show that the stabilizing properties of this change at position 51 have an ameliorating influence on the Z and Siiyamasecretion-defective mutations (Fig. 2). This effect, however, is not equivalent for both dysfunctional proteins; secretion of the Z/Phe51→ Leu double mutant is increased nearly 3-fold, whereas secretion of Siiyama/Phe51→ Leu is equal to M α1-antitrypsin (a greater than 5-fold increase). The increased effect on Siiyamamay simply be a matter of proximity in that removal of Phe51may correct an aberrant conformation of the B helix, induced by the introduction of a third contiguous phenylalanine at position 53, and thus allow closure of the A sheet. The location of the Z mutation, at the hinge of the reactive center loop, will influence both A sheet opening and loop mobility. Changes at position 51 are liable to reverse the former but not the latter and would be predicted to allow only a partial correction of the Z secretory defect. A profound structural transformation from a stressed S conformation to a more ordered, heat-stable, and relaxed R state is observed upon reactive center cleavage of inhibitory serpins. This S to R transition is dependent upon the insertion of the mobile reactive center loop into β sheet A after cleavage of the P1-P1′ peptide bond. Inappropriate insertion of the intact loop into β sheet A is a feature of the polymerization of aberrant serpins, but partial insertion of the uncleaved loop into the β sheet is thought to facilitate formation of the canonical form of the active inhibitor (24Stein P.G. Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 941-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 25Engh R.A. Wright H.T. Huber R. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Skriver K. Wikoff W.R. Patston P.A. Tausk F. Schapira M. Kaplan A.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9216-9221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactive center loops of all inhibitory serpins are characterized by the conservation of small hydrophobic amino acids, particularly at positions P10, P11/12, and P14at the base of the loop (27Stein P.E. Tewkesbury D.A. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These residues are orientated with their side chains facing the hydrophobic interior of the molecule (6Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), and as a consequence, there is a constraint on their size and polarity if loop insertion is to occur. The absence of inhibitory activity and the S to R transition in ovalbumin and angiotensinogen can be explained by the appearance of larger and/or more polar residues in these critical positions (27Stein P.E. Tewkesbury D.A. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similarly, several natural mutants of antithrombin III, C1-inhibitor, and other serpins have been identified with point mutations at positions P12and P10, and in most cases these are proteinase substrates, not inhibitors (26Skriver K. Wikoff W.R. Patston P.A. Tausk F. Schapira M. Kaplan A.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9216-9221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Schulze et al. (29Schulze A.J. Huber R. Degryse E. Speck D. Bischoff R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have shown that substitution of P14Thr by Arg converts a reactive center mutant of α1-antitrypsin from an inhibitor to a substrate that fails to undergo a detectable conformational change. However, a contradictory case has been made by Hood et al. (30Hood D.B. Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8538-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), who constructed a P14Thr → Arg α1-antitrypsin which retained the ability to complex with several cognate proteinases and underwent the S to R transition. Although the effect of such mutations on the thermal stability and inhibitory activity of normal serpins are well established, their influence on polymerization and secretion have yet to be explored. The secretion of Z α1-antitrypsin from oocytes was not improved by the replacement of P14Thr by arginine. This may mean that aggregation is unhampered by partial exclusion of strand 4A from the sheet, alternatively the gap between strands 3A and 5A may be wider as a result of the lysine residue at position 342 and thus able to accommodate the larger and more polar arginine side chain. The assertion that an arginine residue at P14does not prevent polymerization of the Z variant, and presumably does not materially affect loop insertion, is in general agreement with the observation that such a change in the normal inhibitor is compatible with the S → R transition and maintenance of inhibitory function (30Hood D.B. Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8538-8547Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the P14Arg mutation may have other structural consequences in addition to its effect on loop mobility, since the secretion of M type α1-antitrypsin P14Thr → Arg was significantly reduced, but not to the level observed for Z α1-antitrypsin. Alanine to valine substitutions at P11and P12were more effective in overcoming the block in secretion imposed by the Z mutation, causing a 2-fold increase in export of this mutant α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 3). Recent results (28Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) indicate that insertion up to P10is required for the release of strand 1 from the C sheet. The presence of valine at P12, and perhaps P11, will inhibit this insertion and hence the availability of the S1C position for C sheet polymerization. Similarly, a naturally occurring mutation of the human C1-inhibitor with P12Ala → Glu was not an effective inhibitor and did not undergo the S to R conformational change and also showed no tendency to polymerize (26Skriver K. Wikoff W.R. Patston P.A. Tausk F. Schapira M. Kaplan A.P. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9216-9221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine to valine substitutions at both P11and P12will consequently serve to hinder this more extensive incorporation of the loop, although single replacement with threonine at P12does not prevent M type antitrypsin from undergoing the S to R transition (31Hopkins P.C.R. Carrell R.W. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7650-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Thus an increase in secretion of Z antitrypsin with valine residues in both the P11and P12positions is most readily explained by a C sheet mechanism of polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2130847193,"Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) torso defines the spatial domains of expression of the transcription factors tailless and huckebein. Previous analyses have demonstrated that Ras1 (p21ras) operates upstream of the D-Raf (Raf1) serine/threonine kinase in this signaling pathway. By using a recently developed technique of germline mosaics, we find that D-Raf can be activated by torso in the complete absence of Ras1. This result is supported by analysis of D-Raf activation in the absence of either the exchange factor Son of sevenless (Sos) or the adaptor protein drk (Grb2), as well as by the phenotype of a D-Raf mutation that abolishes binding of Ras1 to D-Raf. Our study provides in vivo evidence that Raf can be activated by an RTK in a Ras-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2081379560,"We have reported previously mitogenic effects of gastrin on several immortalized and neoplastic cell lines, including Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Receptor subtypes, cholecystokinin (CCK)-A and CCK-B, for a closely related peptide, cholecystokinin, were recently cloned. These studies were undertaken to investigate if CCK-A- and CCK-B receptors were perhaps mediating the mitogenic effects of gastrin on Swiss 3T3 cells. Receptor antagonists that inhibit the biological effects and binding of peptides to the CCK-A (L-364,718 (L18)) and CCK-B (L-365,260 (L60)) receptors were ineffective toward inhibiting the binding and proliferative effects of gastrin on Swiss 3T3 cells. Radiolabeled L18 and L60 demonstrated no binding to the cells, indicating that CCK-A and CCK-B receptors may be absent on Swiss 3T3 cells. Radiolabeled CCK-8, gastrin, L18, and L60, on the other hand, demonstrated specific binding to a pancreatic cancer cell line (AR42J cells) (used as a positive control). In cross-linking studies the molecular mass of the major band of gastrin receptors (GR) on Swiss 3T3 cells was determined to be ∼45 kDa. The mitogenic potency of 0.1-1.0 n M gastrin-like peptides on Swiss 3T3 cells was in the order of G1-17 ≥ G1-17-Gly > G5-17 ≥ G5-17-Gly > G2-17 > CCK-8-Gly ≥ G1-17-Lys ≥ CCK-8. The relative binding affinity of the peptides (based on the dose-dependent inhibition of binding of 125I-G1-17 to Swiss 3T3 cells) was similar to the relative mitogenic potency of the peptides as given above. Furthermore, G1-17-Gly was equally effective as G1-17 in displacing the binding of 125I-G1-17 to the 45-kDa GR from the Swiss 3T3 cells. Based on these studies it became evident that the novel gastrin preferring GR, expressed by Swiss 3T3 cells, binds and mediates the mitogenic effects of not only the mature (amidated) forms of gastrin-like peptides but also binds and meditates the mitogenic effects of glycine-extended forms of gastrin-like peptides.Possible mRNA expression of CCK-A and CCK-B receptor subtypes by gastrin-responsive rodent intestinal and fibroblast cell lines (Swiss 3T3, IEC-6, CA) was measured by the methods of Northern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. mRNA from rat pancreas, AR42J cells, and rat antrum served as positive controls. We were unable to detect CCK-A and CCK-B receptor mRNA in the three cell lines by both the methods. The positive control samples, on the other hand, gave the expected results. Thus the three gastrin-responsive rodent cell lines examined in this study lacked CCK-A and CCK-B receptors, but were positive for the gastrin preferring GR that demonstrated physicochemical and pharmacological attributes distinct from CCK-A and CCK-B receptors. Since colon cancers are known to express high concentrations of non-amidated gastrin-like peptides, a possible autocrine role of glycine extended forms of gastrin becomes a highly relevant clinical question in the light of the presence of novel GR on the fibroblast and intestinal cell lines.

In the present study, binding characteristics of gastrin to Swiss 3T3 cells are presented for the first time.Cholecystokinin (CCK) shares significant structural homology with gastrin at the C-terminal end and mediates its biological effects via CCK-A and CCK-B receptor subtypes (8Wank S.A.

Recent reports suggest that CCK-A and CCK-B receptors can potentially mediate mitogenic effects of CCK/gastrin-like peptides on normal and cancerous pancreatic cells (12Povoski S.P. Zhou W.

It remains to be determined if CCK-A and CCK-B receptor subtypes are also expressed by normal and cancerous intestinal (IEC-6, CA) and fibroblast (Swiss 3T3) cell lines, which demonstrate a significant mitogenic response to gastrin and express high-affinity (Kd= 0.1-1.0 n M) and low-affinity (Kd= 0.1-1.0 μM) forms of specific gastrin binding sites (6Espeijo R.

Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: A354Google Scholar). In order to investigate this possibility we analyzed fibroblast (Swiss 3T3) and intestinal (CA and IEC-6) cell lines for the possible expression of CCK-A and CCK-B receptors by the methods of Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). At the pharmacological level, specific binding of radiolabeled gastrin, CCK-8, CCK-A receptor antagonist (L-364,718), and CCK-B receptor antagonist (L-365,260) were also measured. The growth stimulatory effects of gastrin were measured in the presence of CCK-A and CCK-B receptor antagonists in order to identify the receptor subtype that may be mediating the mitogenic effects of gastrin on the intestinal and fibroblast cell lines.We and others have recently reported mitogenic effects of a processing intermediate of gastrin (glycine-extended gastrin) on human colon cancer (17Singh P. Xu Z. Dai B. Rajaraman S. Rubin N. Dhruva B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G459-G468PubMed Google Scholar) and pancreatic cancer (18Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T.

In order to further confirm the mitogenic potency of noncarboxyamidated gastrins, we measured the binding and mitogenic potency of Gly- and Lys-extended forms of gastrins in comparison with that of amidated gastrins. Our results point to a possible presence of a novel class of gastrin preferring receptors that bind amidated and glycine extended forms of gastrin with almost equal affinity and are not recognized by the CCK-A and CCK-B receptor antagonists.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureThe three cell lines used in this study included a mouse fibroblast cell line (Swiss 3T3), a normal rat intestinal epithelial cell line (IEC-6 cells) (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), and a mouse colon cancer cell lines (CA) (established in our laboratory (19Singh P. Dai B. Yallampalli C. Xu Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G608-G617PubMed Google Scholar)). A subclone of Swiss 3T3 cells (that were enriched in GRP receptors and developed by Dr. A. Oliff) were obtained from Dr. E. Spindel (Division of Neuroscience Oregon Regional Primate Center). Swiss 3T3 cells were also obtained from ATCC at early passages of <35 and late passages of >100. All the cell lines were grown as monolayer cultures in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (IEC-6, Swiss 3T3) or RMPI 1640 (CA) (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with glutamine (2 m M) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS, Hyclone, Logan, UT) in an atmosphere of 95% O2, 5% CO2at 37°C. The cell lines were regularly monitored for the absence of mycoplasma, using the fluorescence stain Hoechst 33258. Stock cultures of cells were subcultured at appropriate intervals to maintain the cells at subconfluent densities. For cell counting and subculturing the cells were dispersed with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA.In Vitro Growth AssaysCell numbers were either measured directly by counting the total number of cells using a Coulter electronic particle counter (model ZF) or measured indirectly by using a semi-automated tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay (MTT assay). Both the MTT and cell counting assays were conducted essentially as described previously (20Guo Y.-S. Baijal M. Jin G.-F. Townsend Jr., C.M. Singh P. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the MTT assay, cells (1-2 × 103cells/well) were plated into 96-well plates with 200 μl of normal growth medium containing 10% FCS. After 24 h, the medium was changed to serum-free medium, and the cells were cultured for 24 h in order to achieve quiescence. Cell were then stimulated with or without various doses of the peptides in the presence or absence of the nonpeptide receptor antagonist for 48-72 h in serum-free medium. At the end of the treatment, 0.1 mg (50 μl of 2 mg/ml) of MTT was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for an additional 4 h. The medium was then aspirated from the well, leaving about 30 μl of medium in each well. One-hundred fifty μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, Sigma) was added to each well, and the plates were shaken for 10 min to solubilize the formazan crystals. The plates were then read immediately at 540 n M on a scanning multiwell spectrophotometer (Umax, Molecular Devices, Melno, CA). Readings from wells containing culture medium alone with no cells, or cells without various drugs, were used as control. Optical absorbance readings from test wells were corrected against basal control absorbance values. In growth assays where the cell numbers were directly measured with the help of a Coulter counter, an optimal number of cells (0.5-1.0 × 105cells) were plated in 35-mm dishes with 2 ml of normal growth medium containing 10% FCS. After 24 h, the medium was changed to serum-free medium and cells cultured for an additional 24 h. Cells were then treated with various peptides ± receptor antagonists for 48 h in serum-free medium. At the end of the treatment, cells were disbursed with trypsin-EDTA solution as given above and cells counted using either a Coulter electronic counter or with the help of a hemacytometer under light microscope.Binding of Radiolabeled Agonists and Receptor Antagonists with the Swiss 3T3 CellsFor measuring specific binding of gastrin to the Swiss 3T3 cells, we used either synthetic human gastrin (G1-17) or human gastrin 2-17 (G2-17) (Research Plus, Bayonne, NJ). G1-17 and G2-17 were iodinated with IODO-GEN (Pierce) as described previously (21Singh P. Rae-Venter B. Townsend Jr., C.M. Khalil T. Thompson J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: G761-G769PubMed Google Scholar) and specific activity calculated to be ∼1000-2000 cpm/fmol. For measuring specific binding sites for CCK, 125I-BH-CCK-8-sulfate (DuPont NEN) was used. For measuring specific binding sites for CCK-A and CCK-B receptor antagonists, 3H- L-365,260 (specificity activity of 160 dpm/fmol) and 3H- L-364,718 (specificity activity of 184 dpm/fmol) (DuPont NEN) were used, respectively. For cell binding assays, Swiss 3T3 cells were subcultured in 160-mm flasks and grown to subconfluence. All binding assays were performed 36-48 h after cell seeding in culture medium containing 10% FCS and 2% glutamine. Before the start of the binding assays, the cells in culture were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 25 m M HEPES (Sigma) and scrapped with a rubber policeman into conical tissue culture polystyrene tubes. Cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min and resuspended in HBSS at a concentration of 1-3 × 106cells/ml. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of suspended cells in polystyrene tubes were used in all binding assays. All binding assays were conducted essentially as described previously (gastrin (21Singh P. Rae-Venter B. Townsend Jr., C.M. Khalil T. Thompson J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: G761-G769PubMed Google Scholar), CCK (22Guo Y.-S. Singh P. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), L-364,718, and L-365,260 (13Smith J.P. Liu G. Soundararajan V. McLaughlin P.J. Zagon I.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R277-R282PubMed Google Scholar, 23Talkad V.D. Fortune K.P. Pollo D.A. Shah G.N. Wank S.A. Gardner J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1868-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). Briefly, cells in suspension were incubated with either the 125I-labeled peptide (0.5-1.0 n M G1-17; 0.025 n M CCK-8) or the 3H-antagonist (2 n M) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations (0.1 n M to 10.0 μM) of either the homologous or the heterologous peptide/antagonist. The antagonists L-365,260 and L-364,718 were added at a final dilution of 0.01% Me2SO in the binding assay tubes. All control and total binding tubes received the same concentration of Me2SO. Nonspecific binding was determined in all assays in the presence of 1000-fold excess of the nonlabeled peptide/antagonist. Binding assays were performed generally at 37°C for 30 min at pH 7.4 (determined to be optimal for most binding assays as described previously (21Singh P. Rae-Venter B. Townsend Jr., C.M. Khalil T. Thompson J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: G761-G769PubMed Google Scholar, 22Guo Y.-S. Singh P. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 23Talkad V.D.

At the end of the incubation, the cells were pelleted and washed twice with 1 ml of fresh ice-cold HBSS + 0.1% BSA. In the case of the peptide hormone assays, cell pellets were counted for 125I in a γ-counter (model 5500, Beckman) with ∼70% efficiency for 125I counting. In the case of assays for receptor antagonists, the cell pellets were counted for 3H using 10 ml of scintillation fluid, consisting of 5 g of permablend 2 (Packard Instruments) dissolved in 1 liter of toluene and counted in a scintillation counter (Packard TriCarb 460C, Downers Grove, IL) at <2% counting error with conversion to disintegrations/min by external standard ratio method. The binding affinity and total binding capacity of gastrin for binding the Swiss 3T3 cells were determined from a Scatchard plot of the specific binding data (21Singh P. Rae-Venter B. Townsend Jr., C.M. Khalil T. Thompson J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: G761-G769PubMed Google Scholar). The relative binding affinity (RBA) of the amidated and non-amidated gastrin-like peptides for binding the high-affinity GR on Swiss 3T3 and CA cells was determined from a log-dose inhibition of specific binding of 125I-G1-17 by various peptides and receptor antagonists as described previously (21Singh P. Rae-Venter B. Townsend Jr., C.M. Khalil T. Thompson J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: G761-G769PubMed Google Scholar).Determination of the Molecular Mass of GR on Swiss 3T3The molecular mass of GR on Swiss 3T3 cells was measured in cross-linking experiments as described previously (24Narayan S. Chicione L. Singh P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 112: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25Chicione L. Narayan S. Townsend Jr., C.M. Singh P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Aliquots of Swiss 3T3 cells (5 × 106/ml) were labeled with 1 n M 125I-gastrin 2-17 as given above in the presence of 0.1% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% bacitracin, and 100 units/ml of Trasylol and 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated with 1 m M disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, Sigma) for 15 min at 22°C, in the absence of BSA. DSS was dissolved in Me2SO, immediately prior to use, and added to the substrate to give a final concentration of 1% Me2SO in the binding buffer (HBSS, pH 7.4, containing 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The reaction was terminated by rapid centrifugation and the cells washed with excess binding buffer, devoid of BSA. The washed cell pellets were solubilized by boiling at 100°C for 3-5 min in 0.2 M Tris HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 6% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, w/v), 2 m M EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v) in the presence or absence of 4%β-mercaptoethanol (v/v). The supernatant was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 9.5% acrylamide in the separating gel and 4% acrylamide in the stacking gel. The gels were stained, destained, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 5-7 days at −70°C. The autoradiograms were densitometrically analyzed with the help of a laser densitometer (LKB UltroScan XL enhanced densitometer) and GelScan XL Software.PCR and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal cellular RNA was isolated as described previously (26Narayan S. Spindel E.R. Rubin N.H. Singh P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 111-118PubMed Google Scholar) from various cell lines. RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation and quantitated by its absorbance at 260 nm. Purity of RNA was determined by its absorbance at 260/270/280 nm, and the integrity was assessed by fractionating on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and observing the intensities of 28 and 18 S RNA bands after staining with ethidium bromide. Northern blot analysis of the samples was carried out as described previously (26Narayan S. Spindel E.R. Rubin N.H. Singh P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 111-118PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly the samples (∼30 μg of RNA) were electrophoresed through formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to a nylon membrane, and cross-linked with UV light. For analyzing the presence of CCK-A and CCK-B receptor mRNA, plasmids containing the full-length cDNA fragments for the rat CCK-A and CCK-B receptors were used which were kindly provided by Dr. Steven Wank. The rat cDNA probes used included: 1) a 1.5-kilobase pair XbaI insert of CCK-A receptor cDNA fragment inserted in pcDNA-1 plasmid and a 2.2-kilobase pair EcoRI insert of CCK-B receptor cDNA fragment subcloned in the vector PGEM (3ZF+), as per the information provided by Dr. Wank. The cDNA probes were labeled by nick translation and used for Northern hybridization of the RNA blots. The blots were washed under less stringent conditions (2 × 15 min at room temperature with 6 × SSPE (1 × SSPE, 0.18 M NaCl, 10 m M sodium phosphate (pH 7.7), 1 m M EDTA) 0.1% SDS, and 2 × 15 min at 48°C with 1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS) in order to enable us to detect CCK-A and CCK-B receptor-like transcripts that may show only partial homology with the cDNA probes used.cDNA Synthesis and PCR AmplificationcDNA synthesis and PCR was conducted as described previously (17Singh P. Xu Z. Dai B. Rajaraman S. Rubin N. Dhruva B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G459-G468PubMed Google Scholar). For PCR amplification of the cDNA, 10 pmol each of upstream and downstream primers and 1 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of DNA polymerization (72°C, 1.5 min), denaturation (94°C, 30 s), and primer annealing (58°C, 30 s) in a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. The upstream and downstream primers were designed based on published cDNA sequences of rat CCK-A and CCK-B receptor genes in order to flank the coding sequences for the mature peptide. The sequences for the specific primers used are given in the legend of Fig. 7.Statistical AnalysisDifferences between means were compared by the use of the unpaired Student's t test and were considered statistically significant at the level of p < 0.05.RESULTSProliferative Effects of Gastrin on Swiss 3T3 Cells in VivoThe growth response of Swiss 3T3 cells to increasing concentrations of gastrin is presented in Fig. 1. The proliferation of Swiss 3T3 cells increased sharply in response to 0.5-1.0 n M gastrin and declined in the presence of higher concentrations (5-10 n M) of gastrin. A second smaller peak of activation was obtained between 0.1 and 0.5 μM gastrin, which was once again reduced to control levels in the presence of 1-10 μM gastrin. Gastrin at doses of 0.5-1.0 n M was most effective and increased the total number of Swiss 3T3 cells significantly above control values within 48 h of stimulation (n = 8). The maximum growth stimulatory effect of 0.5 n M gastrin was measured to range from ∼40 to ∼110% over and above control values in different experiments. The proliferative effects of the maximum effective dose of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and BBS (that are mitogenic for the subclone of Swiss 3T3 cells), were also measured simultaneously. Both IGF-I and BBS demonstrated a significant mitogenic effect at the maximum effective dose of 15 ng and 10 n M, respectively. IGF-I (2 n M) was only slightly more potent than 0.5 n M gastrin, and the difference was not statistically significant. BBS (10 n M), on an average, was slightly less potent than 0.5 n M gastrin, but once again the difference was not statistically significant. At higher doses, the mitogenic potency of IGF-I (6.6 n M) and BBS (50 n M) was similar to that measured at the maximally effective concentrations of the two peptides (data not shown). Similarly, in previous studies we have measured a plateauing in the growth response of colon cancer cells to BBS (4Narayan S. Guo Y.-S. Townsend Jr., C.M. Singh P. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6772-6778PubMed Google Scholar) and IGF-I (27Guo Y.-S. Narayan S. Chandrasekhar Y. Singh P. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102 (1992): 1101-1108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in response to increasing concentrations of the two peptides with no evidence of a sharp decline in the potency of the peptides at higher concentrations as measured in the case of gastrin.FIG. 1Dose-dependent growth effects of gastrin, IGF-I, and bombesin on Swiss 3T3 cells. Swiss 3T3 cells in culture were stimulated with or without various concentrations of G1-17 and two optimally effective doses of IGF-I and bombesin as shown. Growth was measured in terms of optical density/well in an MTT assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The optical density values measured in control (nontreated) wells was arbitrarily assigned a zero value, and all changes in the OD measurements from the peptide-stimulated wells were converted as a percent value of the measurements in the control wells.

Chicione L. Singh P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 112: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Based on these preliminary results, it became evident that there were at least two classes of specific gastrin binding sites present on Swiss 3T3 cells, arbitrarily named Type I and Type II sites, just as we have reported previously for gastrin binding sites on normal and cancerous colonic cells (6Espeijo R.

There also is evidence that PTH stimulates arachidonic acid metabolism(26Feyen J.H.M. Van Der Wilt G. Moonen P. DiBon A. Nijiweide P.J. Prostaglandins. 1984; 28: 269-281Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), changes membrane potentials(27Edelman A. Fritsch J. Balsam S. Am. J.

The goal of the present study was to analyze the role of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the PTH/PTHrP receptor in activating adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C, by comparing the properties of R480 and R513, truncated rat PTH/PTHrP receptor mutants with carboxyl-terminal deletions of 111 and 78 amino acids, with those of the wild-type (WT) rat receptor, which is 591 amino acids in length. R480 has been shown to contain the minimal length necessary for full ligand binding, whereas R513 is the rat receptor equivalent of OK-H, a truncated version of the opossum PTH/PTHrP receptor (OK-O) studied previously (29Segre J.V. Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Schipani E. Force T. Urena P. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Kolakowski L.F. Hock J. Bonventre J. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1992; 15: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar). When these three PTH/PTHrP receptors were expressed at closely similar cell surface densities, PTH stimulation of these truncated receptors strikingly increased cAMP accumulation without changing their capacities to stimulate polyphosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, compared with the WT receptor. The PTH/PTHrP receptor's carboxyl-terminal intracellular region contains domains that lower the binding affinity of the WT receptor for agonist, directly interact with or indirectly facilitates the interaction of the receptor with a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G protein that inhibits adenylyl cyclase, and decreases the efficacy with which the receptor couples to G8 Rat PTH-(1-34)-NH2 (rPTH) and bovine [Nle8,18, Tyr34]PTH-(1-34)NH2 (NlePTH) were purchased from Bachem (Irvine, CA). Reagents of the highest purity available were obtained either from Sigma or Fisher. Na125I (2125 Ci/mmol) for peptide and cAMP iodination, goat anti-rabbit 125I-IgG for receptor antibody binding studies, and 35S-dATP (1000-1500 Ci/mmol) for sequencing were purchased from DuPont NEN. [3H]Myoinositol (17.7 Ci/mmol) with PT6-271-polymer, which adsorbs decomposed radionuclides, was obtained from Amersham Corp. Restriction enzymes were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp., New England BioLab (Beverly, MA), and Promega (Madison, WI). DEAE-dextran for transfecting COS-7 cells was obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. COS-7 cells were a generous gift from Dr. B. Seed, Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA). Human [Tyr36]PTHrP-(1-36)NH2 (PTHrP) and oligonucleotides were synthesized by Dr. H. T. Keutmann of this Endocrine Unit. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Mediatech, Washington D. C.) supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone, Logan, UT), 1.2 mM glutamine, and 4.5 g/liter of glucose at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Medium was renewed every 3 days, and cells were passaged by trypsinization when near confluence. Fig. 1 schematically depicts the 591-amino acid WT rat PTH/PTHrP receptor and the carboxyl-terminally truncated receptors R480 and R513. These truncated receptors were constructed using the polymerase chain reaction with the WT receptor serving as a template (30Loh E.Y. Elliott J.F. Cwirla S. Lanier L.L. Davis M.M. Science. 1989; 243: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Antisense primers were designed to introduce stop codons followed by an XbaI site, leading to truncations of 111 (R480) and 78 (R513) amino acids of the carboxyl-terminal tail, respectively (GeneAmp, Perkin-Elmer), whereas a sense primer contained 24 nucleotides from the intact WT rat PTH/PTHrP receptor sequence with an NsiI site at 1398. Polymerase chain reaction products were first digested with NsiI and XbaI, purified on agarose gel, electroeluted, and then extracted with phenol/chloroform. The 2.2-kilobase pair WT receptor cDNA R15B-RI (31Jüppner H. Schipani E. Bringhurst F.R. McClure I. Keutmann H.T.J. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) in pcDNA1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) was first digested with XbaI and then with NsiI, creating a vector with an NsiI site at position 1398 of the receptor and the XbaI site in the pcDNA1 polylinker region. The purified inserts then were ligated into the purified vector. The authenticity of the cloned mutant cDNAs was determined by restriction enzyme mapping and sequence analysis (32Sanger F. Coulson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) of the nucleotides amplified by polymerase chain reaction and the adjacent sequences. Receptor cDNAs in pcDNA1 were prepared by the CsCl method (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatas T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.41-1.50Google Scholar) and were introduced into COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran transfection method(34Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Solner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5711Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The quality and quantity of plasmid DNA was electrophoretically assessed on 0.8% agarose gel, after measuring OD at 260 nm. For transfections, a given amount of the plasmid DNA was diluted in 190 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.42) and then this mixture was further diluted in 760 μl of 10 mg/ml DEAE-dextran solution. Cells, in 150-mm dishes (approximately 107 cells), were first gently washed twice with prewarmed PBS and exposed to 19 ml of DMEM containing 10% Nuserum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 100 μM chloroquine. The transfection mixture of plasmids in the DEAE-dextran solution was then added to the cells. The transfection mixture was removed after a 3-h incubation at 37°C and then the cells were exposed to PBS containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at room temperature for 2 min. The cells were then cultured in DMEM supplemented with 7% FBS for an additional 24 h and replated into 24-, 12-, or 6-well plates at a density of 50-100,000 cells/cm2. Cells were studied 60-72 h after transfection. Transfected cells grown in 24-well plates were washed twice with 1 ml of binding buffer, pH 7.7, containing 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.5% FBS. For radioreceptor assays, cells were incubated with 125I-[Tyr36]PTHrP-(1-36)-NH2 (PTHrP) 100,000 cpm/500 μl/well in binding buffer in the absence or presence of unlabeled rPTH-(1-34) (10−12 to 10−6M) at 16°C for 4 h. In some experiments, we used bovine 125I-[Nle8,18,Tyr34]PTH-(1-34)-NH2 instead of PTHrP, since we found no significant difference in results of experiments using these two ligands(35Jüppner H.

Cells were then processed, and bound radioactivity was measured, as described previously(22Bringhurst F.R. Jüppner H. Guo J. Urena P. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1992; 132: 2090-2098Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 35Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.B. Uneno S. Gu W.X. Potts Jr., J.T. Segre G.V. J. Biol.

Specific binding was determined by subtracting binding in the presence of 10−6M rPTH from total binding. Receptor number per transfected cell and their affinities were determined by Scatchard analysis(36Bylund D.B. Yamamura H.I. Yamamura H.I. Enna S.J. Kuhar M.J. Methods for Receptor Binding. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 1-35Google Scholar), after correcting for transfection efficiency, and receptor density was confirmed using a sheep antireceptor antiserum, G48, which was developed against a synthetic 18-amino acid peptide (DKGWTPASTSGKPRKEKA) of the rat PTH/PTHrP receptor's extracellular amino-terminal region. The antiserum was purified by affinity chromatography with antigen immobilized to Sepharose 4B by the CNBr method(37Nagai K. Thogersen H.C. Nature. 1984; 309: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Transfected cells, grown in 24-well plates, were washed three times with PBS, pH 7.4, containing 5% FBS and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in PBS in the presence of G48 (0.5 μg/250 μl/well, 1:500 dilution) or preimmune sheep serum (same dilution as G48). Cells were then washed thoroughly (four times) with 5% FBS/PBS, incubated first for 1 h at room temperature with affinity-purified rabbit anti-sheep IgG (H+L) (Kirkland & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and then with 200-300,000 cpm/250 μl/well of goat anti-rabbit 125I-IgG. After 1 h, the cells were washed three times with PBS, solubilized in 1 N NaOH, and the radioactivity was counted. Transfected cells were treated exactly as described above, but rather than adding goat anti-rabbit 125I-IgG, we added mouse anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) (22°C, 1 h) and fixed the cells with 2% paraformaldehyde, after washing them three times with 5% FBS/PBS. The number of transfected, receptor-bearing cells was counted using fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Axiouscope, Oberkoken, Germany), and the total number of cells was determined under bright field. Five different fields in each of three wells per group were counted. Transfected cells were preincubated in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% BSA, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.42, and 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) at room temperature for 10 min and further incubated at 37°C for an additional 15 min after adding agonist or vehicle. Cyclic AMP accumulation was determined after a 15-min incubation with rat PTH-(1-34) (rPTH), because PTH (100 nM) produced a linear increase in intracellular cAMP concentration in COS-7 cells for up to 30 min in the presence of 1 mM IBMX (Fig. 2A). Basal cAMP levels were measured in transfected cells that were incubated at 37°C for 15 min in the presence of 1 mM IBMX. Reactions were terminated by aspirating the medium, washing the cells with ice-cold PBS, and freezing the cells in 500 μl of 50 mM HCl. Cells were stored at −80°C until intracellular cAMP was measured by radioimmunoassay, as described previously(23Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Westberg D. Potts Jr., T.J. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Hormone-stimulated cAMP accumulation is expressed after subtracting basal values. Transfected cells, grown in six-well plates, were labeled at 37°C for 8-12 h with 3 μCi/ml of [3H]inositol in serum- and inositol-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.1% BSA. (Preliminary studies had shown that the inositol pool of the COS-7 cells was labeled to equilibrium with [3H]myoinositol by 8 h.) After cells were washed twice with prewarmed serum- and inositol-free DMEM containing 20 mM LiCl and 0.1% BSA, they were treated with rPTH (10−11 to 10−6M) or with v ehicle alone (10 mM acetic acid, basal values) at 37°C for an additional 30 min. PTH (100 nM) produced time-dependent increases in IP1 and IP2 accumulation that were linear for at least 1 h (Fig. 2B). However, since the IP3 production rate was linear only for the first 30 min, we used 30-min incubations for all experiments. The reaction was terminated by aspirating the incubation medium and adding 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. After extracting the trichloroacetic acid with water-saturated diethyl ether (three times) and adjusting the pH of the solution to 7.4, the solutions were chromatographed on AG 1 × 8 anion-exchange columns (formate form, 100-200 mesh, Bio-Rad). After free [3H]inositol and glycerophosphate inositol fractions were eluted with 10 ml of 10 mM inositol and 8 ml of 5 mM Borax, 60 mM sodium formate, respectively, the IP1, IP2, and IP3 fractions were collected by sequential elution with 8, 10, and 10 ml of 0.2, 0.5-0.7, and 1.05 M ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid, respectively(17Berridge M.J. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Brown K.D. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 21Iida-Klein A. Hahn T.J. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1016-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). IP2 was first sequentially eluted with 1 ml each of 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, and 0.65 M and 6 ml of 0.7 M ammonium formate, 0.1 M formic acid; these eluents were then pooled as the “IP2” fraction. This modification provides better resolution of IP2 from IP3. Radioactivity in 1 ml of each fraction was counted with a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman, model LS 6000IC). Hormone-stimulated PI hydrolysis was determined after subtracting basal values from the values obtained in the presence of hormone. Total IPs are the sum of IP1, IP2, and IP3. Means ± S.E. of duplicate or triplicate samples were calculated from 2-17 independent experiments. Data were analyzed using one way analysis of variance and the Scheffe-F test to determine significance. We first characterized the full-length WT receptor's capacities to bind ligands and antireceptor antibody and to stimulate adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C. In COS-7 cells transiently expressing the WT receptor (2-3 × 106 receptors/transfected cell), the apparent Kd for 125I-PTHrP binding was 2.1 ± 0.3 nM, whereas EC50 values for cAMP accumulation and PI hydrolysis were 0.3 ± 0.1 nM and 4.0 ± 0.2 nM, respectively (Fig. 3; since the PI hydrolysis response was not quite maximal at 10−6M PTH, this EC50 is an approximation). Significant stimulation of cAMP accumulation was detected in cells treated with as low as 10−11M PTH, a concentration that did not detectably displace the radioactive ligand. PTH-stimulated PI hydrolysis, however, was substantially less sensitive than PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation; it was first detected at ligand concentrations between 10−10 and 10−9M. When the two second messenger responses are normalized by setting maximal responses to 100%, lower levels of receptor occupancy elicited relatively greater increases in cAMP accumulation, compared with the level of receptor occupancy needed for similar increases in PI hydrolysis. Cell surface expression markedly differed among the mutant and WT receptors, when the same amount (5 μg) of plasmid DNA was used for transfection. Since we sought to study the properties of these receptors at similar expression levels, we first determined the levels of cell surface expression for each receptor, after transfecting COS-7 cells with varying amounts of plasmid DNA (0.05-5 μg of WT and 0.1-10 μg of R513 and R480). The number of PTH binding sites per cell, as calculated from Scatchard analysis, was dependent on the amount of introduced plasmid DNA, but markedly differed among these receptor constructs (Fig. 4A). Levels of receptor expression comparable with those obtained with the WT receptor could only be achieved by transfecting the COS-7 cells with higher amounts of either truncated receptor construct. To further characterize the relationship between cell surface expression of the three receptors and the amount of the transfected plasmid DNA, we assessed whether changes in cell surface expression were due to variation in the number of cells expressing receptors or to variations in the number of receptors expressed per cell. When COS-7 cells were transfected with 0.1 or 5 μg of plasmid DNA containing the WT receptor construct, there was no significant difference in the percentage of COS-7 cells that stained positively by immunofluorescence (Table 1). In all experiments, the transfection efficiency for the WT receptor construct in COS-7 cells was consistently 17-20%, regardless of the amount of DNA used, and was indistinguishable from the transfection efficiency for either mutant receptor construct (Table I). Thus, the amount of cDNA introduced determined PTH/PTHrP receptor's cell surface expression per cell, but did not influence the number of transfectable cells in this transient expression system. To match the expression level of each receptor, we varied the amount of DNA used for transfection, while maintaining a ratio of plasmid DNA for R591/R513/R418 of 1/25/50, respectively. The results from G48 antireceptor antibody binding confirmed observations based on Scatchard analysis (Fig. 4B).Table ITransfection efficiency as assessed by immunostaining with antiserum to the receptor Radioreceptor assays were conducted in triplicate for each construct, over a range of 5 × 104 to 106 receptors/transfected cell. Scatchard analysis showed that the apparent Kd values of rPTH-(1-34) for WT, R513, and R480 receptors were 1.81 ± 0.19 nM (n = 17), 1.24 ± 0.12 nM (n = 11), and 0.48 ± 0.05 nM (n = 13), respectively, and were consistent within each group over this level of receptor expression. All were statistically different from each other: WT versus R513 (p < 0.05), WT versus R480 (p < 0.001), R513 versus R480 (p < 0.01). Next, we correlated the level of receptors expressed with the activated receptor's capacity to stimulate cAMP accumulation and PI hydrolysis. Ligand binding, cAMP accumulation, and PI hydrolysis were always compared in cells from the same transfection. PTH (100 nM)-stimulated PI hydrolysis in COS-7 cells expressing WT, R513 (Fig. 5A), and R480 receptors (Fig. 6A) was linearly dependent upon the level of receptor expression and was indistinguishable among the WT and the two truncated receptors (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). In contrast, although PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation also correlated with the level of receptor expression, it was 2-4- and 4-6-fold higher in the cells expressing R513 (Fig. 5B) and R480 (Fig. 6B), respectively, compared with the WT receptor, at all levels of receptor expression.FIG. 6The signal transduction properties of the WT rat PTH/PTHrP receptor compared with R480, as a function of the number of receptors expressed. COS-7 cells were transfected with varying amounts of plasmid DNA containing either WT (○) or mutant R480 (•) receptors, radioreceptor assays were then performed, and the number of receptors expressed per transfected cell was determined by Scatchard analysis. The capacity of COS-7 cells expressing these receptors to generate IP metabolites (A) and to increase intracellular cAMP (B) in response to treatment with PTH (100 nM) then was determined, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data (mean ± S.E.) are from one of three representative experiments, all of which were performed in triplicate. When not shown, S.E. values are so small that they fall within the symbols.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then assessed the dose-response relationships for PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation in COS-7 cells expressing comparable levels of WT, R513, and R480 receptors. To achieve these levels, we transfected cells with 0.1, 2.5, and 5.0 μg of plasmid DNA containing WT, R513, and R480 receptor constructs, respectively. These transfections resulted in expression of 620,000, 505,000, and 520,000 per cell for WT, R513, and R480 receptors, respectively, as determined by Scatchard analysis. Maximal cAMP stimulation was 2- and 6-fold higher in COS-7 cells expressing R513 and R480, respectively, than in those expressing the WT receptor (Fig. 7); however, the EC50 values of PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation were similar for the three constructs. We and others have reported previously that pretreatment of a rat osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cell line, ROS 17/2.8(38Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Potts Jr., J.T. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2594-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Pines M. Santora A. Gierschik P. Menczel J. Spiegel A. Bone Miner. 1986; 1: 15-20PubMed Google Scholar), and human osteoblasts in primary culture (40Iida-Klein A. Varlotta V. Yee D.C. Kobayashi R. Hahn T.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 879Google Scholar) with PTX augmented PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation, without any significant alteration of the basal cAMP levels. These results suggested coupling of the native PTH receptor to a PTX-sensitive inhibitory G protein, putatively a member of the Gi family. Since truncated receptors had higher maximal PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation than WT receptors, we tested the hypothesis that a putative PTX-sensitive Gi protein might couple to the WT receptor, but not to the truncated receptors. COS-7 cells expressing similar levels of WT and truncated (R513 or R480) PTH/PTHrP receptors (5-6 × 105 binding sites/cell) were treated with 100 ng/ml PTX for 14 h before stimulating the cells with 10−12 to 10−7M PTH. PTX augmented PTH-stimulated cAMP production by 2-fold at all concentrations of PTH in cells expressing WT receptors, but it failed to alter PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation in cells expressing either mutant receptor (Fig. 8). Our most striking observation is that rat PTH/PTHrP receptors with truncated carboxyl-terminal, intracellular regions signal adenylyl cyclase with markedly higher efficacy, compared with the WT receptor, but have indistinguishable capacities to hydrolyze PI. We initially noted lower ligand binding in cells transfected with R480 and R513, compared with the WT receptor, when the same amount of DNA was used for transfection. Because the properties of WT and truncated receptors might be influenced by the levels at which they were expressed, we first sought conditions that matched levels of functional receptors. These preliminary studies demonstrated that the number of receptors expressed per transfected cell was markedly influenced by both the amount of plasmid DNA and by the specific construct used for transfection, but that the percentage of transfected cells was independent of either parameter; that is, each transfected COS-7 cell expressed WT receptors more efficiently over a broad range of added DNA, compared with their expression of either R480 and R513. Careful control of the conditions for COS-7 cell's incubation and transfection and of the amount of plasmid DNA used for transfection enabled us to compare the properties of the truncated and WT receptors at closely similar levels of receptors per cell and over a relatively wide range of expressed receptors. The magnitude of both maximal PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation and PI hydrolysis depended on the level of cell surface expression in COS-7 cells. The rates of PI hydrolysis were indistinguishable between either truncated mutant and WT receptor when cells expressing matched levels of the three receptors were treated with 100 nM PTH, over a wide range of receptor levels. In contrast, R480 and R513 increased cAMP accumulation by 5-6- and 2-3-fold, respectively, compared with the WT receptor expressed at comparable levels, when treated with the same dose of hormone. These data confirm and extend those of an earlier observation from our laboratory, which demonstrated that PTH-stimulated increases in intracellular [Ca2+] and increases in the rates of PI hydrolysis correlated directly with the number of PTH/PTHrP receptors stably expressed in LLC-PK1 cells, a porcine kidney cell line without endogenous PTH/PTHrP receptors(22Bringhurst F.R. Jüppner H. Guo J. Urena P. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1992; 132: 2090-2098Crossref Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 41Guo J. Abou-Samra A.B. Bringhurst F.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: S-176Google Scholar). In a previous study(29Segre J.V. Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Schipani E. Force T. Urena P. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Kolakowski L.F. Hock J. Bonventre J. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1992; 15: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar), we had noted that a carboxyl-terminally truncated opossum kidney PTH/PTHrP receptor (OK-H) that contains 508 of the 585 amino acids of the full-length receptor (OK-O), and is the opossum homolog of R513, seemed to have unimpaired capacity to activate adenylyl cyclase, but reduced capacity to stimulate the rate of PI hydrolysis. In recent experiments in which receptor expression was carefully controlled, however, we found, instead, that OK-H had an unimpaired capacity to stimulate PI hydrolysis and enhanced capacity to stimulate cAMP accumulation (data not shown). We had misinterpreted our early experiments because we had failed to rigorously control for the number of receptors expressed per cell. Our observation that the intact, cloned PTH/PTHrP receptor interacts with a PTX-sensitive G protein linked to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase extends earlier observations we and others have made in studies of endogenous receptors on ROS 17/2.8 cells (38Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Potts Jr., J.T. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2594-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Pines M. Santora A. Gierschik P. Menczel J. Spiegel A. Bone Miner. 1986; 1: 15-20PubMed Google Scholar) and primary cultures of human osteoblasts(40Iida-Klein A. Varlotta V. Yee D.C. Kobayashi R. Hahn T.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1989; 4: 879Google Scholar), where PTX treatment enhanced intracellular cAMP accumulation, without altering basal levels. Since the PTX effect was seen only with the WT receptor, the receptor's interaction with this inhibitory G protein must rely, directly or indirectly, on the sequence between residues 513 and 591. Future efforts are needed to further identify the domain(s) involved in mediating this function. Other aspects of our observations also will require additional experiments before they are fully understood. For example, the higher efficacy (maximal cAMP responsiveness) with which R480 activates adenylyl cyclase, compared with the WT receptor, can be attributed in part to the absence of a site that enables the PTH/PTHrP receptor to couple to a PTX-sensitive G protein which inhibits adenylyl cyclase and which is present between residues 513 and 591 of the receptor's sequence. Other factors, however, must also be involved in modulating this response, because PTH treatment of R513 elicits a maximal cAMP response that is lower than the response of R480, although both mutant receptors are insensitive to PTX, but higher than the response of the WT receptor, which is sensitive to PTX. Second, the higher binding affinities with which R480 and R513 bind agonist, compared with the WT receptor, would predict lower EC50 values of both adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C responses, if the increased binding energy were associated with a conformation that activated G proteins. This was not observed with either effector response; neither the EC50 nor the maximal phospholipase C response was modified, nor was any change noted in the EC50 of the adenylyl cyclase response, although the strikingly higher maximal cAMP accumulation might have made it difficult to appreciate any change. Taken together, these data suggest that the affinity of ligand binding to the these receptors can be dissociated from activation of the two effector pathways. This appears to clearly be the the case with activation of phospholipase C. With respect to activation of adenylyl cyclase, these truncated PTH/PTHrP receptors appear to have higher capacities to increase intracellular cAMP accumulation, compared with the WT receptor. It is difficult to relate this property directly to the changes in ligand binding affinity, however, because no change in the EC50 values was noted. Additionally, the different affinities with which these two truncated receptors bind agonist, when expressed in COS-7 cells, suggest that multiple intracellular receptor sequences influence this property. Interestingly, Parker and Ross (42Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9987-9996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that truncated avian β-adrenergic receptors activated adenylyl cyclase with higher efficacy than the full-length receptor. Although these truncated receptors had modestly increased affinity for ligands, the influence of PTX on the adenylyl cyclase response was not assessed. Studies of PTH/PTHrP receptors transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, however, have limitations as well as certain advantages. They allow relatively rapid comparisons of different receptors at various levels of expression, which can be rigorously controlled at levels above 104 receptors/transfected cell, and they provide a system that allows the properties of these receptors to be assessed independently without complicating variables, such as clonality that influence stably expressed receptors. On the other hand, receptor expression is difficult to control at more modest levels. Furthermore, the signaling properties of the PTH/PTHrP receptor necessarily depend on the particular complement of G proteins and other cytoplasmic factors present in COS-7 cells. Studies in which PTH/PTHrP receptors are characterized in the context of a cellular milieu other than COS-7 cells, therefore, are likely to provide additional information. These results highlight the functional importance of the carboxyl-terminal region of the PTH/PTHrP receptor, as manifested mainly by the striking discordance between the increased PTH-stimulated cAMP accumulation and the unchanged response in PTH-stimulated PI hydrolysis, when the properties of mutant PTH/PTHrP receptors with deletions of this region are compared with those of the WT receptor. Sequences in the PTH/PTHrP receptor's carboxyl-terminal intracellular region have multiple influences on receptor function: they lower the apparent affinity of the WT receptor for agonist; contain domains distal to amino acid 513 that directly interact with, or indirectly facilitate its interaction with, a PTX-sensitive G protein, presumably a member of the Gi family that inhibits adenylyl cyclase; and they decrease the efficacy (maximal agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation) with which the receptor interacts with Gs.

https://openalex.org/W2040553608,"In neurons of the mammalian brain primary transcripts of genes encoding subunits of glutamate receptor channels can undergo RNA editing, leading to altered properties of the transmitter-activated channel. Editing of these transcripts is a nuclear process that targets specific adenosines and requires a double-stranded RNA structure configured from complementary exonic and intronic sequences. We show here that the two independent editing sites in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor GluR-B pre-mRNA are edited with positional accuracy by nuclear extract from HeLa cells. Nucleotide analysis by thin layer chromatography of the edited RNA sequences revealed selective adenosine to inosine conversion, most likely reflecting the participation of double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase. Our results predict the presence of inosine-containing codons in other mammalian mRNAs.

Our results predict the presence of inosine-containing codons in other mammalian mRNAs. RNA editing is a posttranscriptional process that changes the sequence of gene transcripts (1Cattaneo R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 71-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2Bass B.L. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 383-418Google Scholar). This process is common in mitochondria of plants and protozoa where, as a rule, transcripts undergo multiple editing events to acquire translatable open reading frames. By contrast, RNA editing has been found in only a few mammalian nuclear transcripts where it generates single codon substitutions and, hence, changes in the cognate proteins. Apolipoprotein B (apoB) RNA of the small intestine provided the first example of editing in a nuclear transcript (3Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25621-25624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hodges P. Scott J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 77-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this RNA a premature stop codon is introduced by cytidine deamination (CAA to UAA), leading to a truncated protein with altered function. A uridine to cytidine substitution changing a leucine to a proline codon occurs in transcripts of the Wilm's tumor susceptibility gene in kidney and testis (5Sharma P.M. Bowman M. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukumar S. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Adenosine-specific RNA editing was found in mammalian transcripts of neural origin (6Sommer B.

Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). In this family, the transcripts of five genes are known to undergo RNA editing in a total of eight positions. In each instance, the transmitter-activated channel acquires altered ion permeability or kinetic properties (8Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Höger T. Geiger J. Kuner T. Monyer H. Sprengel R.

For example, the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor GluR-B pre-mRNA is edited in two independent positions, from a CAG to a CGG codon (Q/R site; Ref. 6Sommer B. Köhler M.

L-glutamate-activated receptor channel double-stranded RNA editing site complementary sequence dithiothreitol reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. Our present understanding concerning mechanistic aspects of this enigmatic control over functional channel determinants in central neurons is rudimentary. One recent advance has been the identification of intronic editing site complementary sequences (ECS) that form a short intramolecular dsRNA structure with the to-be-edited exonic sequence (10Higuchi M. Single F.N. Köhler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). As documented for both the Q/R and R/G sites in GluR-B pre-mRNA these dsRNA structures serve as substrates for a positionally precise RNA editing (8Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Höger T. Geiger J. Kuner T. Monyer H. Sprengel R. Higuchi M. Bach A. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 10Higuchi M. Single F.N. Köhler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the edited adenosines might constitute inosines generated by adenosine deamination in RNA (2Bass B.L. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 383-418Google Scholar, 6Sommer B. Köhler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Indeed, the preferred base pairing properties of inosine with cytidine would lead to the incorporation of guanosine in a cDNA position occupied by inosine in the RNA template. The requirement for dsRNA and the fact that only adenosines are targeted in GluR pre-mRNAs have given rise to the hypothesis that dsRNA adenosine deaminase might operate the nucleotide change by hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine (2Bass B.L. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 383-418Google Scholar, 10Higuchi M. Single F.N. Köhler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H.

We have now employed an in vitro system to determine the nature of the edited adenosine in GluR-B pre-mRNA. As shown in this study, editing by nuclear extract displays the positional accuracy and all sequence requirements previously established in cellular assays (8Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Höger T. Geiger J. Kuner T. Monyer H. Sprengel R. Higuchi M. Bach A. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 10Higuchi M. Single F.N. Köhler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Importantly, nuclear extract from HeLa cells mediates the site-selective conversion of adenosine to inosine in both the Q/R site and the R/G site. RNAs were transcribed from murine GluR-B minigene constructs. For Q/R site editing DNA constructs were B13 and B13Δ6, which carries a deletion in its ECS sequence and hence is not edited in transfected cells (10Higuchi M. Single F.N. Köhler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). DNAs were linearized with XbaI and upon transcription in vitro generated RNAs of an approximate length of 720 nucleotides, including all of exon 11 and 530 nucleotides of intron 11. For R/G site editing, DNA constructs were BglII- BglII (exon 13 into intron 15) carrying the intronic E2 mutation (increased editing relative to wild type sequence) and BglII- BglII carrying the intronic S1 mutation (editing incompetent) (8Lomeli H. Mosbacher J. Melcher T. Höger T. Geiger J. Kuner T. Monyer H. Sprengel R. Higuchi M. Bach A. Seeburg P.H. Science. 1994; 266: 1709-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). These constructs were linearized with StuI (unique site in exon 14) and yielded RNAs of approximately 1,100 nucleotides containing exon 13, intron 13, and part of exon 14. In vitro transcription was performed for 60 min at 37°C in 25 μl containing 80 m M Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 32 m M MgCl2, 2 m M spermine, 40 m M DTT, 5 m M each of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP, 10 μCi of α-[32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), 750 units of SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega), 37.5 units of RNasin (Promega), 475 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase from yeast (Promega), and 1 μg of linearized recombinant vector DNA. Radiolabeled, high specific activity RNAs were synthesized in the presence of 10 μM GTP and 120 μCi of α-[32P]GTP (Amersham Corp., 3,000 Ci/mmol). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by EtOH precipitation of the phenol/chloroform-extracted reactions. RNAs used for reverse transcription (RT) followed by PCR (12Wahle E. Keller W. Higgins S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing. Vol. 2. IRL Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 1-34Google Scholar) were treated three times for 45 min at 37°C with 10 units of RNase-free DNase (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of 20 units of RNasin (Fermentas). Removal of DNA from RNA was demonstrated by PCR amplification (see below). Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells according to Ref. 13Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar except that high salt buffer C contained 1.2 M KCl instead of NaCl. Extracts were stored in aliquots at −80°C and had a protein concentration of about 10 μg/μl in 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5% glycerol, 0.75 m M MgCl2, 0.1 m M EDTA, and approximately 270 m M KCl, as measured by conductivity. For standard assays, RNAs (between 10 and 100 fmol) were incubated at 30°C for 3 h in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 12.5 μl of nuclear extract and having a final buffer composition (“Q buffer”) of 25 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 135 m M KCl, 2.5 m M EDTA, 6.25% glycerol, 1 m M DTT, 50 μg/ml poly(A). Reactions (25 μl) having 2 μl of nuclear extract yielded in B13 and E2 RNAs approximately half of the editing levels achieved with 12.5 μl of extract. After incubation, reaction mixtures were deproteinized by adding equal volumes of 200 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 m M NaCl, 25 m M EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.8 mg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37°C, and RNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Preincubation of extract with 1,000 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 30 min at 30°C did not reduce Q/R site editing; incubation was in the presence of 1 m M CaCl2, which was chelated by 2 m M EGTA before adding B13 RNA. Preincubation (30 min, 30°C) with proteinase K (0.8 mg/ml) abolished Q/R site editing. For Q/R site editing, 10 fmol of 5′32P-labeled oligonucleotide primer B-RT (3 × 106dpm/pmol) were hybridized to extract-incubated and purified RNA (approximately 3-5 fmol) in 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 m M KCl, 3 m M MgCl2, 10 μM each of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP and 250 μM ddTTP (Pharmacia) by heating for 5 min to 80°C and annealing at 55°C for 4 h in a final volume of 9 μl. After addition of 0.8 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1 μl of 0.1 m M DTT the reactions (10.5 μl final volume) were incubated for 1 h at 42°C. For the analysis of RT-PCR products generated from extract-incubated R/G-edited RNAs, approximately 20 ng of agarose gel-purified PCR product was denatured in alkaline, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 m M KCl, 3 m M MgCl2, 10 μM each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, 250 μM ddTTP, and 10 fmol of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide B-RTFF45. After 5 min at 55°C, 0.8 unit of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase plus 1 μl of 0.1 M DTT were added, and the reactions (10.5 μl final) were incubated for 45 min at 42°C. Nucleic acid was fractionated on a 15% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gel, and dried gels were exposed to x-ray film with a DuPont Cronex Lightning intensifying screen. Quantitative analysis was performed on a PhosphorImager (Fuji, BAS1000). Extract-incubated and purified RNAs (3-5 fmol), resuspended in 20 μl of H2O containing 1 μM primer for reverse transcription (KMH3 for Q/R site editing, BFFK3 for R/G editing), were denatured (70°C, 10 min) and added to a 10-μl RT mix (50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 75 m M KCl, 3 m M MgCl2, 10 m M DTT, 20 units of RNasin, and 500 μM of each dNTP). A 10-μl aliquot of each reaction was removed for control purposes (“mock RT”). The remainder was incubated with 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus, Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h at 37°C and 5 min at 95°C. A first PCR amplification using the primers lacZ1/PCRK3 (Q/R site editing) or cis55/PCRK3 (R/G site editing) was in 20 μl of 20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 m M KCl, 1.5 m M MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, 400 n M primers, and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cycle conditions were: 94°C, 3 min; 20 step cycles (94°C, 20 s; 55°C, 30 s; 72°C, 40 s); and 72°C, 10 min. A second PCR amplification with the nested primer sets MH36/lacZ1 (Q/R site editing) or cis55/intB1 (R/G site editing) was in 50 μl for 35 step cycles. The PCR-generated DNA fragments served as templates for primer extension at the R/G site or were directionally cloned in doubly digested phage M13 RF-DNA (M13 mp19, cleaved with PstI and EcoRI for Q/R site fragments; M13 mp18, cleaved with KpnI and EcoRI for R/G site fragments) (14Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar). Filter lifts of recombinant phage plaques were hybridized overnight at 22°C in 5 × SSC (1 × SSC: 0.15 M NaCl, 15 m M sodium citrate) with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides B-R (Q/R site) or EDFF-3 (R/G site). Filters were washed in 1 × SSC at 56°C (Q/R site) or 50°C (R/G site) to distinguish edited from unedited sequences. At least 12 recombinant phage DNAs carrying edited and unedited Q/R and R/G forms were sequenced (ABI sequencer 373A). RNAs (150 fmol, ∼109dpm/μg) incubated in nuclear extract were purified (see above) and resuspended in 20 μl of 10 m M PIPES, pH 6.4, 100 m M NaCl, 0.25 m M EDTA containing 50 pmol of the oligonucleotides Bprotect (Q/R site) or FF-Bprotect (R/G site). Oligonucleotide was annealed to RNA (3 min, 90°C; 30 min, 55°C), and 170 μl of 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 m M NaCl, 5 m M EDTA containing 0.2 unit of RNase A and 70 units of RNase T1 (Boehringer Mannheim) were added. RNase digestion was for 30 min at 37°C (Bprotect) or 32°C (FF-Bprotect), followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation with 10 μg of glycogen as carrier. Precipitated nucleic acid was resuspended in 10 μl of 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol and electrophoresed on a native 15% polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TBE (90 m M Tris borate, 2 m M EDTA, pH 8.0) at 200 V for 8-9 h. Protected bands were gel-eluted overnight at 22°C in 0.5 M NH4Ac, 1 m M MgCl2, 0.1 m M EDTA, 0.1% SDS. Nucleic acid was collected by ethanol precipitation after sterile filtration (Millipore, 0.22 μM) of the eluate, denatured (5 min, 70°C), and digested to 3′-nucleoside monophosphates in 20 μl of 10 m M NH4Ac, pH 4.5, containing 0.5 unit of ribonuclease T2 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 h at 37°C. The digest was dried in a SpeedVac concentrator, resuspended in 3 μl of water containing 3′-XMPs (where X is A, I, G, C, or U; 1 μg/μl each; Sigma), spotted on a cellulose plate (Sigma), and chromatographed in saturated (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M NaAc, pH 6, 2-propyl alcohol (79:19:2, by volume). Internal labeling of RNA by α-[32P]GMP combined with ribonuclease T2-mediated label transfer permitted an evaluation of label distribution in 3′-XMPs derived from the oligonucleotide-protected RNA moieties. In the protected B13 RNA moiety (Fig. 2 a), the 5′-32P groups of nine GMPs are transferred by T2 to three 3′-GMPs, three 3′-UMPs, two 3′-AMPs (unedited), or one 3′-IMP (fully edited). Within the E2 RNA moiety (Fig. 2 b) these numbers are five 3′-GMPs, two 3′-UMPs, one 3′-AMP (unedited), or one 3′-IMP (edited). Radioactive spots on one-dimensional TLCs (3′-UMP and 3′-CMP co-migrate) were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Fuji, BAS 1000), and the relative abundance of each 3′-XMP was determined. In four experiments the averaged ratios ± S.D. for the labeled 3′-XMPs from protected B13 RNA were G/C + U/A/I, 2.6 ± 0.1/3.2 ± 0.1/2.1 ± 0.1/0.11 ± 0.06 (theoretical values: 3/3/1.7/0.3, assuming 30% Q/R site editing) and for E2, 4.1 ± 0.3/2.1 ± 0.2/1.6 ± 0.2/0.2 ± 0.1 (theoretical: 5/2/0.9/0.1, assuming 10% R/G site editing). Deviations from predicted values result from contamination by heterodisperse RNA fragments of the gel-isolated heteroduplexes, as evidenced by radioactive material in gel lanes resolving the unprotected ribonuclease A and T1-treated RNAs (Fig. 2) and the 3′-[32P]CMP spot on two-dimensional TLC (Fig. 3).FIG. 3Two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography of ribonuclease T2 digestion products of the oligodeoxynucleotide-protected in vitro edited B13 (a) and E2 (b) RNAs. Isobutyric acid/NH4OH/water (66:1:33, by volume) was used as solvent for the first dimension (migration, bottom to top) and saturated (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M NaAc pH 6, 2-propanol (79:19:2, by volume) for the second dimension (migration, left to right). The individual 3′-XMPs (Gp, Ap, Ip, Up, Cp) are indicated on the chromatograms.

Nuclear extract prepared from HeLa cells (12Wahle E. Keller W. Higgins S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing. Vol. 2.

Site-selective editing was determined by primer extension (Fig. 1) performed on the recovered RNAs (Q/R site) or on their RT-PCR products (R/G site).

Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) based on PCR-mediated sequence amplification (13Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar), directional cloning of amplified DNAs, and probing the recombinant phage plaques with oligonucleotides for edited and unedited sequence forms. Furthermore and importantly, DNA sequencing of sets of recombinant phage DNAs derived from RNAs incubated in nuclear extract (Fig. 1, legend) demonstrated that the only edited positions concerned the adenosines of the Q/R and R/G sites (not shown). Collectively these data indicate that the sequence requirements for the in vitro editing of two independent positions in GluR-B pre-mRNAs are those previously established by cell transfection. Similarly, the positional selectivity of editing observed for GluR-B minigenes in transfected cells is strictly maintained by the nuclear extract. Analysis of 60 cloned DNA sequences derived from in vitro edited B13 RNA showed no evidence for the low level editing of additional adenosines observed around the Q/R site in native GluR-B pre-mRNA (10Higuchi M. Single F.N. Köhler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar).Table I:RNA editing of GluR-B RNAs by nuclear extract from HeLa cellsTable I:RNA editing of GluR-B RNAs by nuclear extract from HeLa cellsAll reactions (25 μl) contained 12.5 μl of nuclear extract and were incubated for 3 h at 30°C.

All reactions (25 μl) contained 12.5 μl of nuclear extract and were incubated for 3 h at 30°C. Numbers in parentheses indicate independent determinations; standard deviations of values listed were ≤20%. ND, not determined. Editing was abolished by heat treatment (10 min, 65°C) or proteinase K digestion of nuclear extract but not by micrococcal nuclease. GluR-B pre-mRNAs when incubated in the absence of extract under conditions used to reveal RNA self-modification (15Shub D.A. Peebles C.L. Hampel A. Higgins S.J. Hames B.D. RNA Processing. Vol. 2. IRL Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 211-239Google Scholar) showed no site-selective editing. Thus, editing appears not to be mediated by the RNA itself nor does it require other RNAs but is mediated by protein components provided by the nuclear extract. Indeed, the extent of editing depended on the amount of extract (see “Materials and Methods”). Failure of the editing reaction to go to completion did not appear to result from limiting amounts of editing factor(s) in extract since editing efficiencies remained constant over a 10-fold concentration range of RNA (Table I). The addition of ATP to 100 μM did not alter the extent of editing (not shown), indicating that editing is not dependent on ATP as an energy source. Editing was not affected by poly(I), poly(C), and poly(dI)˙poly(dC) but was efficiently inhibited by poly(I)˙poly(C) (inhibitory constant, IC50∼0.3 n M), revealing the participation of a factor with high affinity for dsRNA. This factor is likely to be dsRNA adenosine deaminase (2Bass B.L. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 383-418Google Scholar, 11Kim U. Nishikura K. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which converts adenosines to inosines in extended dsRNA with limited positional specificity (16Polson A.G. Bass B.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5701-5711Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). dsRNA adenosine deaminase displays such high affinity binding to dsRNA (equilibrium binding constant, Kd∼0.2 n M; Ref. 17Kim U. Garner T.L. Sanford T. Speicher D. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13480-13489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the optimal KCl concentration (approximately 100 m M, Table I) for in vitro editing of the Q/R site in GluR-B pre-mRNA was that required by purified dsRNA adenosine deaminase (18O'Connell M.A. Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10596-10601Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for optimal adenosine to inosine conversion in dsRNA. However, B13 RNA is not edited by the purified enzyme, 2M. A. O'Connell and W. Keler, unpublished data. suggesting that site-selective editing may involve additional factor(s). To determine the chemical nature of the edited adenosine, 3′32P-labeled mononucleosides (XMPs) generated by ribonuclease digestion of a short sequence within internally labeled, extract-incubated RNAs were analyzed by TLC (19Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Different GluR-B-specific RNAs were enzymatically synthesized in the presence of α-[32P]GTP and were incubated with nuclear extract. The radiolabeled, edited RNAs, recovered intact as judged by gel migration (not shown), were hybridized with a molar excess of an oligodeoxynucleotide (24-mer) complementary to the RNA sequence around the edited nucleotide position (Fig. 2). After digestion with the single-stranded specific ribonucleases A and T1 the resultant RNA-DNA heteroduplexes were resolved by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The heteroduplex containing the protected B13 RNA moiety appeared as three closely spaced bands of different intensities. The same triplet of bands was generated by ribonuclease digestion of a synthetic oligomeric RNA-DNA hybrid (Fig. 2 a) and probably reflects the removal by ribonuclease of terminal bases from the oligodeoxynucleotide-protected RNA. Gel-recovered heteroduplexes were subjected to digestion by ribonuclease T2, which generates 3′-XMPs from RNA (20Rushizky G.W. Sober H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 371-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the transfer of the 5′-32P group in GMPs to the 3′ position of the preceding nucleoside. Digested material was resolved by one-dimensional TLC. As a result, radiolabel co-migrating with 3′-IMP was readily detected in the appropriate in vitro edited RNA species (Fig. 2). The nature of the inosine in the edited B13 and E2 RNAs was further confirmed by two-dimensional TLC (Fig. 3). In four experiments editing levels as assessed by 3′-[32P]IMP/3′-[32P]AMP ratios on one-dimensional TLC were 11 ± 0.6% for B13 RNA and 13.2 ± 0.9% for E2 RNA. The low level editing of B13 RNA in these experiments is apparently due to sequence contamination of the gel-isolated B13 heteroduplex, as evidenced by the 3′-[32P]CMP spot on the two-dimensional chromatogram (Fig. 3) (see also “Materials and Methods”). The sequence specificity of in vitro adenosine to inosine conversion was clearly demonstrated by the absence of inosine in B13Δ6 RNA (Fig. 2 a) in a B13 RNA mutant in which a guanosine residue had been substituted for the Q/R site adenosine (not shown) and in S1 RNA (Fig. 2 b). Thus, nuclear extracts can be employed to characterize the biochemical machinery responsible for specific adenosine editing. As a first milestone, this in vitro system permitted the identification of edited adenosines in GluR-B pre-mRNAs as inosine residues. Formation of inosine is most likely due to enzymatic adenosine deamination since upon dialysis of nuclear extract editing efficiencies remained unchanged, indicating that nucleotides required for transglycosylation or nucleotide replacement are not necessary for GluR editing. Our results are compatible with the notion (2Bass B.L. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 383-418Google Scholar, 10Higuchi M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) that dsRNA adenosine deaminase is a candidate enzyme for the selective adenosine editing in GluR transcripts of central neurons. In view of the ubiquitous expression of this recently cloned (21Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 22O'Connell M.A. Krause S. Higuchi M. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Jenny A. Keller W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) enzyme, adenosine deamination should be more widespread in nuclear pre-mRNAs than anticipated on the basis of GluR transcript editing. This conclusion is further strengthened by the observation that many cell lines, including HeLa cells, contain the machinery for the correct editing of GluR-B pre-mRNA even in the absence of endogenous GluR gene expression (10Higuchi M. Single F.N. Köhler M. Sommer B. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). We now anticipate the unprecedented occurrence of inosine in select codons of other mammalian mRNAs. As established for GluRs, these codons (23Basillo C. Wahba A.J. Lengyel P. Speyer J.F. Ochoa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) are likely to specify functionally critical residues in the cognate protein products. Hence, we propose that site-selective adenosine deamination may be a general mechanism for increasing the functional diversity of mammalian gene products.

The ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans is able to utilize purines as nitrogen sources. The pathway of purine catabolism has been studied genetically and physiologically (Scazzocchio and Darlington, 1968Scazzocchio C. Darlington A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 166: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar; Scazzocchio et al., 1982Scazzocchio C. Sdrin N. Ong G. Genetics. 1982; 100: 185-208PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the genes involved is subject to pathway-specific induction by uric acid (Scazzocchio, 1973Scazzocchio C. Mol. & Gen.

Genet. 1991; 230: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and to nitrogen metabolite repression mediated by the GATA-like, areA-positive regulatory gene product (Arst and Cove, 1973Arst Jr., H.N. Cove D.J. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1973; 126: 111-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar; Kudla et al., 1990Kudla B. Caddick M.X. Langdon T. Martinez-Rossi N.M. Bennet C.F. Sibley S. Davies R.W. Arst Jr., H.N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Early genetic evidence suggested the existence of two specific, active transport systems responsible for the uptake of various purines and their analogues: (i) a system responsible for the uptake of uric acid and xanthine, their thioanalogues 2-thiouric acid and 2-thioxanthine, allopurinol, and oxypurinol (Darlington and Scazzocchio, 1967Darlington A.J. Scazzocchio C. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 937-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Arst and Cove, 1973Arst Jr., H.N. Cove D.J. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1973; 126: 111-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar; Arst and Scazzocchio, 1975Arst Jr., H.N. Scazzocchio C. Nature. 1975; 254: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Scazzocchio and Arst, 1978Scazzocchio C. Arst Jr., H.N. Nature. 1978; 274: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The uapA gene has been genetically identified as the gene coding for the major permease of this system. Similar to previously isolated uapA−loss-of-function mutations (Darlington and Scazzocchio, 1967Darlington A.J. Scazzocchio C. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 937-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), uapA insertional inactivation mutations (Diallinas and Scazzocchio, 1989Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C. Genetics. 1989; 122: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) result in leaky growth on uric acid or xanthine as nitrogen sources and in partial resistance to their thioanalogues, allopurinol and oxypurinol. These observations suggested the existence of, at least, one other permease with similar specificity with the uapA gene product. The uapA gene has been cloned (Diallinas and Scazzocchio, 1989Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C. Genetics. 1989; 122: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its sequence determined, and its expression studied at the level of message accumulation (Gorfinkiel et al., 1993Gorfinkiel L. Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23376-23381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). uapA codes for a highly hydrophobic protein with 12-14 putative transmembrane domains. Its expression is inducible by 2-thiouric acid (and by implication by uric acid), repressible by ammonium, and almost absolutely dependent on functional uaY and areA gene products. (ii) A system specific for the uptake of adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and the analogues 8-azaguanine and purine; loss-of-function mutations in the corresponding gene, azgA, led to azaguanine resistance and to reduced growth on adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine as nitrogen sources. In contrast to the highly regulated expression of the uapA gene, azgA expression is probably constitutive (Darlington and Scazzocchio, 1967Darlington A.J. Scazzocchio C. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 937-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to uapA− mutants, azgA− loss-of-function mutants have leaky phenotypes, suggesting the existence of a “secondary” permease transporting the same purines and analogues as the azgA gene product (Darlington and Scazzocchio, 1967Darlington A.J. Scazzocchio C. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 937-940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation areA102 is a leucine to valine change in the zinc finger of the AreA regulatory protein (Kudla et al., 1990Kudla B. Caddick M.X. Langdon T. Martinez-Rossi N.M. Bennet C.F. Sibley S. Davies R.W. Arst Jr., H.N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) altering specifically the expression of several genes under areA control. It results in enhanced expression of a number of genes, abolishes the expression of others, and does not affect the expression of some others (Hynes and Pateman, 1970Hynes M.J. Pateman J.A. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1970; 108: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; Arst and Cove, 1973Arst Jr., H.N. Cove D.J. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1973; 126: 111-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar; Arst and Scazzocchio, 1975Arst Jr., H.N. Scazzocchio C. Nature. 1975; 254: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although areA102 mutants show normal expression of all genes encoding enzymes involved in purine catabolism, they cannot grow on uric acid or xanthine as nitrogen sources due to reduced uptake of these purines (Arst and Scazzocchio, 1975Arst Jr., H.N. Scazzocchio C. Nature. 1975; 254: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Gorton, 1983Gorton, D. J., (1983) Genetic and Biochemical Studies of Purines and Their Degradation Products in A. nidulans, Ph.D Thesis, University of Essex, United KingdomGoogle Scholar). Strains carrying this mutation show unimpaired growth on the uric acid precursor, hypoxanthine. We have shown that the areA102 mutation leads to drastically reduced uapA gene expression (Arst and Scazzocchio, 1975Arst Jr., H.N. Scazzocchio C. Nature. 1975; 254: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Diallinas and Scazzocchio, 1989Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C. Genetics. 1989; 122: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Gorfinkiel et al., 1993Gorfinkiel L. Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23376-23381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inability of the strains carrying areA102 mutation to grow on uric acid or xanthine is absolute, in contrast to strains carrying uapA− mutations. Interestingly, the areA102 mutation also eliminates the residual growth of azgA− mutants on hypoxanthine (or adenine or guanine) (see below). These observations suggested that this mutation affects similarly the expression of uapA and of the gene(s) coding for the uptake proteins responsible for the residual growth of strains carrying the uapA− and azgA− mutations. As areA102 single mutants are not affected in their utilization of hypoxanthine it can be concluded that the azgA gene is normally expressed in the presence of the areA102 mutation. We have previously referred to the gene uapC (Scazzocchio and Gorton, 1977Scazzocchio C. Gorton D.J. Smith J.E. Pateman J.A. Genetics and Physiology of Aspergillus. Academic Press, 1977: 255-265Google Scholar; Diallinas and Scazzocchio, 1989Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C.

V., Amsterdam1994: 221-257Google Scholar) as a gene which might code for a secondary uric acid-xanthine permease. Here, we present rigorous genetic and biochemical evidence that the uapC gene product is a wide specificity purine permease responsible for the leaky phenotypes of uapA− and azgA− mutants on various purines as nitrogen sources. We report the sequence of the uapC gene and analyze its putative product which shows approximately 58% identity to the UapA permease and significant similarities to a number of bacterial pyrimidine trans-porters. Our analyses also suggested that two previously reported open reading frames of unknown function in Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfrigens might encode purine transporters. Finally, we study the regulation of uapC message accumulation under different physiological conditions of growth and in different regulatory mutants. Standard media and growth conditions of A. nidulans were previously described (Cove, 1966Cove D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 113: 51-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Scazzocchio et al., 1982Scazzocchio C. Sdrin N. Ong G. Genetics. 1982; 100: 185-208PubMed Google Scholar). Supplements were added when necessary. Non-inducing, inducing, and inducing-repressing conditions have been previously established (Suárez et al., 1991Suárez T. Oestreicher N. Kelly J. Ong G. Scazzocchio C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The following A. nidulans strains were used: biA1; pabaA1; yA2 pantoB100; fwA1 pyroA4 areA102; uapA24 pabaA1; uapA24 azgA4 pabaA1; uap-100 biA1; uap-100 areA102 pabaA1; uapC201biA1; fwA1 uap-100 uapC201 biA1; uapC201 areA102 pabaA1; azgA4 pabaA1; azgA4 areA102 pyroA4 pabaA1; fwA1 uapC201 areA102 azgA4 pyroA4 pabaA1; uaY207 pabaA1; uapC201 uapC401 pabaA1; uapC201 uapC401 uapA24 pabaA1; uapC201 uapC401 azgA4 pabaA1; uapC201 uapC401 uapA24 azgA4 pabaA1; uapC201 areA102 argB2 pabaA1; biA1, pabaA1, pyroA4, pantoB100 and argB2 indicate auxotrophies for biotin, p-aminobenzoic acid, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, and arginine, respectively. yA2 and fwA1 result in yellow and fawn conidia, respectively. All these markers do not affect the regulation of gene products involved in purine catabolism. areA102 is described in the Introduction and has also been described previously (Kudla et al., 1990Kudla B. Caddick M.X. Langdon T. Martinez-Rossi N.M. Bennet C.F. Sibley S. Davies R.W. Arst Jr., H.N.

Res. 1965; 6: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Purine uptake was assayed by a novel method.1 1U. Tazebay, V. Sophianopoulou, C. Scazzocchio, and G. Diallinas, unpublished results. This method measures uptake in germlings. These are conidiospores incubated for a short time in nutrient media and thus committed to germination and nuclear division but where the germinal tube is not yet visible. Preliminary work in a variety of systems, including purine permeation, demonstrated that germlings showed the same response to induction as mycelia.1This method avoids all the complications of uptake measurements in a mycelial mat (Scazzocchio and Arst, 1975). The appropriate strains of A. nidulans were grown for 3 days on complete media at 37°C. Conidiospores were collected and used to inoculate liquid cultures of 200 ml of minimal medium with 5 m M urea as sole nitrogen source, all necessary supplements, and 27 μM of 2-thiouric acid as a gratuitous inducer. Before inoculation the spores are counted and the concentration adjusted so as to give a final concentration of ≈5 × 106conidiospores/ml in the culture media. Inoculated cultures were incubated at 120 revolutions/min for 210 min at 37°C. At the end of this incubation step, conidiospores were filtered through millipore filters (0.45 μm) and washed with minimal medium plus supplements. Washed conidia were resuspended in 10 ml of minimal medium plus supplements. This gives a concentration of ≈108conidia/ml. 0.5 ml-aliquots of this suspension were distributed in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes and equilibrated for 10 min at 37°C. Uptake was initiated by the addition of radiolabeled uric acid or hypoxanthine at a final concentration of 20 μM. Uptake assays were terminated by the addition of cold uric acid or hypoxanthine, at a final concentration of 0.8 m M, after 15, 30, 60, and 120 s. Conidiospores were then washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold minimal medium plus 0.8 m M uric acid or hypoxanthine, boiled in 5% trichloroacetic acid, and soluble radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The uptake rates of uric acid and hypoxanthine were linear throughout the sampling period. We have also determined that, under the above conditions, uptake is directly proportional with the number of conidiospores in the suspension. The actual viable conidiospore number was determined, for each assay, by removing and plating on complete medium, serial dilutions of an aliquot obtained before the final washing step. Initial uptake rates are expressed in p M substrate incorporated/min 107viable conidiospores. Uniformly labeled [8-14C]uric acid (specific activity 1.94 GBq/mmol) and [G-3H]hypoxanthine (specific activity 244 GBq/mmol) were obtained from Isotopchim, Ganagobie-Peyruis, France and Amersham International, United Kingdom.

[32P]ATP-labeled DNA molecules used as gene-specific probes were prepared by using random hexanucleotide primers following the supplier's instructions (Amersham). Cloning of the uapC gene involved screening of a λ EMBL4 genomic library of A. nidulans (a gift from C. M. Lazarus) in the same buffer as that described for Northern or Southern blots, at 58°C, and filters were then washed twice in 2 × SSC, at 58°C. DNA was sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977Sanger F. Nicklens S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The first strand thus synthesized was directly annealed with the oligonucleotide O12, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase was added, and reiterative polymerase chain reaction cycles were performed as described in the protocol of the GeneAmp DNA Amplification Reagent kit 5 (Perkin-Elmer-Cetus Instruments). The program used included 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 52°C for 2 min, and elongation at 72°C for 3 min. The resulting DNA product consisted of 1793 bp 2The abbreviations used are:bpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s). and included the complete 5′-non-coding region of the uapC transcript and a nearly complete uapC open reading frame (the last four, C-terminal, codons are missing). This cDNA fragment was cloned by standard procedures in bluescript KSII+ digested with the SmaI restriction enzyme and sequenced as described previously for the genomic uapC clones. To map the 3′ end of the uapC transcript, a reverse transcription reaction was performed, as described above, using an oligo(dT) primer, and then the DNA single strand products were amplified with oligonucleotide O11 in the presence of radiolabeled [35S]dATP (Amersham). The size of the radiolabeled uapC-specific DNA product was estimated (139 and 142 bp) by 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis, using as size markers a uapC DNA sequence reaction with the same oligonucleotide (O11). base pair(s) kilobase(s). Primer extension was performed using 5 μg of either non-induced or induced total RNA and the oligonucleotide O4 in the presence of 20 units of reverse transcriptase, 1 unit of RNasin, a “cold” nucleoside mixture (20 μM) of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 5 μCi of radiolabeled [35S]dATP, in a standard extension buffer, for 1 h at 45°C.

Nature. 1975; 254: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar previously described the isolation of uap-100, defined as an initiator constitutive, up-promoter mutation in the uapA gene. This mutation was later shown to be a 164-bp tandem duplication located 103 bp upstream from the uapA translation start resulting in a pronounced increase in the steady state uapA mRNA levels under both non-induced and induced conditions (Diallinas and Scazzocchio, 1989Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C. Genetics. 1989; 122: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Gorfinkiel et al., 1993Gorfinkiel L. Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23376-23381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uap-100 mutation was selected as a mutation suppressing the inability of an areA102 mutant to grow on uric acid. Extragenic revertants of a uapA24 (loss-of-function) areA102 double mutant selected on uric acid or xanthine should include gain-of-function mutations, analogous to uap-100, in the gene(s) coding for the secondary permease(s) which are not expressed in an areA102 background. Indeed, we isolated a number of suppressors which defined uapC, a new gene involved in uric acid-xanthine uptake. The mutation uapC201 exemplifies this class of suppressors (see Fig. 1); it was mapped by mitotic haploidization (McCully and Forbes, 1965McCully K.S. Forbes E. Genet. Res. 1965; 6: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) to chromosome I but recombines freely with uapA mutations (results not shown). Four phenotypically identical revertant mutations were closely linked to uapC201 (results not shown). By analogy to the uap-100 mutation, the specific suppression of the areA102 allele might result from regulatory mutations in the promoter of the uapC gene. In agreement with this assumption, we showed (results not shown) that: (i) in an areA+background, the uapC201 mutation leads to increased sensitivity to 2-thioxanthine and 2-thiouric acid even in the presence of strongly repressing concentrations (10 m M) of ammonium as a nitrogen source; (ii) a uapC201 uapA24 double mutant grows clearly better than a uapA24 single mutant on uric acid or xanthine as nitrogen sources; and (iii) a uapC201 uap-100 double mutant shows an additive phenotype in respect to 2-thioxanthine (or 2-thiouric acid) sensitivity suggesting that two different uptake systems are involved. These results strongly suggested that the uapC gene codes for a permease able to take up, at least, uric acid, xanthine, 2-thioxanthine, and 2-thiouric acid. As areA102 eliminates the residual growth of azgA− mutants on hypoxanthine, adenine, or guanine as nitrogen source, it could be asked whether the UapC permease is also responsible for the residual uptake of these purines. A triple mutant, areA102 azgA4 (loss-of-function) uapC201, was constructed and tested on various purines as nitrogen sources. Fig. 1 shows that uapC201 suppresses partially the inability of an azgA4 areA102 double mutant to utilize hypoxanthine (and also adenine and guanine, results not shown) as sole nitrogen source and leads to reduced resistance to 8-azaguanine (not shown). Thus, our results show that: (i) uapC codes for a permease able to transport all naturally occurring purines, thus overlapping the specificities of the uapA and azgA gene products; (ii) uapC gene expression is under areA control and is absent (as judged by growth tests) in strains carrying the areA102 allele; and (iii) uapC gain-of-function mutations, such as uapC201, specifically but partially suppress the effect of the areA102 allele. In order to substantiate the role of the uapC gene in purine uptake, we isolated loss-of-function mutants. A uapC201 areA102 mutant strain, which is sensitive to 0.1 mg/ml 2-thioxanthine in the presence of 3 m M ammonium as nitrogen source, was mutagenized by UV light or N-methyl- N-nitro- N-nitrosoguanidine and 2-thioxanthine-resistant colonies were selected as described previously (Alderson and Scazzocchio, 1967Alderson T. Scazzocchio C. Mutat. Res. 1967; 4: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar; Diallinas and Scazzocchio, 1989Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C. Genetics. 1989; 122: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such mutants could, in principle, be the result of loss-of-function mutations in a number of genes involved in purine catabolism (uaY, hxA, hxB, cnx; Diallinas and Scazzocchio, 1989Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C. Genetics. 1989; 122: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as, loss-of-function mutations in the uapC or areA genes. However, very simple growth tests previously described (Alderson and Scazzocchio, 1968; Diallinas and Scazzocchio, 1989Diallinas G. Scazzocchio C. Genetics. 1989; 122: 341-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) allowed us to distinguish uptake mutants (and thus potential uapC− mutants) from all other classes. These mutants should not grow on uric acid or xanthine, grow less well than wild-type strains on hypoxanthine, adenine, or guanine, and show resistance to 2-thioxanthine, 2-thiouric acid, and allopurinol. Five strains with the expected phenotype were isolated. In order to investigate whether the putative uapC− mutations (uapC401, uapC402, uapC403, uapC404, and uapC405) were genetically linked to the uapC gene (identified by the uapC gain-of-function mutations), we crossed all putative uapC− uapC201 areA102 mutants to a uapC+areA102 strain. Only uapC+uapC201areA102 recombinants should be able to grow on uric acid as a nitrogen source. All putative uapC− mutations showed very tight linkage to the uapC201 mutation; mutations uapC403, uapC404, uapC405 did not recombine with mutation uapC201 while mutations uapC401 and uapC402 recombine"

These receptors bind to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA, known as hormone response elements or HREs. HREs are the sites of receptor binding to the regulatory regions of target genes, and these elements confer hormone inducibility to such genes.

The DNA response element for the estrogen receptor is known as the estrogen response element or ERE. The consensus ERE, which is a perfect palindrome with the sequence GGTCA nnnTGACC, was initially discovered in the chicken (3Burch J.B.E. Evans M.I. Friedman T.M. O'Malley B.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1988; 8: 1123-1131Google Scholar) and Xenopus vitellogenin genes (4Klein-Hitpass L. Ryffel G.U. Heitlinger E. Cato A.C.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 647-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and is thus often referred to as the vit-ERE as well as the consensus ERE. It is generally thought that the ER binds to the palindromic vit-ERE as a homodimer (5Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). However, some recent data are more consistent with the estrogen receptor binding as a monomer (6Gorski J. Furlow J.D. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M. Kaneko K. Ying C. Malayer J.R. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and it is clearly established that other members of the steroid/thyroid superfamily can function as heterodimers (7Hawa N.S. Hewison M. Farrow S.M. O'Riordan J.L.H. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In addition to the vitellogenin ERE, a number of naturally occurring EREs have more recently been defined (8Anolik J.H. Klinge C.M. Bambara R.A. Hilf R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 713-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and most exhibit some sequence homology to the consensus element. However, there is considerable variability in these elements, and the vit-ERE is the only naturally occurring sequence so far identified that has two perfect palindromic half-sites. In contrast to the vit-ERE, few studies have directly investigated the nature of the estrogen receptor species that interacts with other EREs. Although the majority of HREs identified to date are located in the 5′-flanking region of target genes within 1-2 kb or less of the promoter (9Lannigan D.A. Koszewski N.J. Notides A.C. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), HREs have recently been found in the intron (10Sap J. deMagistris L. Stunnenberg H. Vennstrom B.

We now report the identification of an estrogen-dependent enhancer activity within the coding sequence of the rat c- jun. The sequence (GCAGA nnnTGACC) present in the c- jun exon competes with the consensus ERE for estrogen receptor binding in cell-free band shift assays and confers hormone inducibility to β-galactosidase reporters in yeast and mammalian cell transcriptional assay systems. The identification of functional EREs in both major AP-1 partners coupled with their rapid induction by estrogen in vivo supports the hypothesis that AP-1 is a component of the estrogen-induced signal transduction cascade which regulates target cell proliferation. DNA-manipulating enzymes were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim and Promega (Madison, WI). [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Corp. Estradiol-17β, mercaptoethanol, adenine sulfate, O-nitrophenyl-β- D-galactopyranoside, uracil, and general reagents were purchased from Sigma. Dithiothreitol was from Boehringer Mannheim, whereas reagents for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were obtained from Bio-Rad. Casamino acids, yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, dextrose, and other media components were obtained from Difco. High performance liquid chromatography grade ammonium persulfate was obtained from Bio-Rad. Oxalyticase was obtained from Enzogenetics (Corvallis, OR). Reagents for polymerase chain reaction were from Perkin-Elmer. Uterine cytosol from 18-21-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) was prepared as described previously (26Hyder S.M. Stancel G.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, estradiol-17-β was added to a final concentration of 10 n M, and after a 1-h incubation in ice, cytosol was warmed to 25°C for 45 min. To measure the ER content another aliquot of cytosol was labeled with 5 n M [3H]estradiol in the presence or absence of 200-fold excess diethylstilbesterol for 4 h at 4°C, and the reaction was terminated with dextran-coated charcoal as described previously (27Hyder S.M. Wittliff J.L. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). ER concentrations generally ranged from 1 to 2 n M and were not altered by warming to 25°C. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA kit from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as standard and generally ranged from 2 to 4 mg/ml. In some experiments, cytosol was used immediately for the band shift assay, and in others it was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use. There was no difference in results whether fresh or frozen cytosol was used for gel shift assays. Band shift assays utilized extracts from the rat uteri (prepared as described above) as the source of ER and double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides. DNA was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, and T4-polynucleotide kinase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Band shift assays utilized the basic approach described by us elsewhere (26Hyder S.M.

Briefly, the binding reactions contained 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 m M NaCl, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) for every 5 μg of soluble protein and 0.05-0.20 ng of the vit-ERE probe (30,000-100,000 cpm) or 0.5-1.0 ng of the c- jun-ERE probe (approximately 200,000 cpm). The reactions generally contained 10 μg of the uterine protein extract as the source of receptor. In some experiments up to 40 μg of protein was used in order to help enhance binding of receptor to gene fragments derived from c- jun (not shown). The samples were incubated for 15 min at 4°C before addition of the radioactive probe, and in most cases the reaction was continued for a further 15 min on ice. Following incubation the protein-DNA complexes were separated on 4% polyacrylamide gels in either 6.7 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m M EDTA, 3.3 m M sodium acetate for samples containing binding reactions with radioactive c- jun-ERE or in Tris-glycine buffer obtained in the gel shift kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) for experiments which involved ER interaction with radioactive vit-ERE only (competitive gel shift assays). Electrophoresis was conducted at a constant voltage of 160 V for 90 min, and the gels were then dried and autoradiographed. The affinity-purified antibody ER-715 raised against residues 270-284 in the highly conserved hinge region of the ER (28Furlow J.D. Ahrens H. Mueller G.C. Gorski J. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (kind gift of Dr. Jack Gorski) was used where indicated in the gel shift studies. The double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides used for the initial screening for ER binding in the competition band shift assays were the same as shown in Fig. 1 except that they included a 4 base overhang at the 5′-end with GATC. The ERE from the Xenopus vitellogenin A2 gene (vit-ERE) was used as a standard ERE for comparative purposes (26Hyder S.M. Stancel G.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is referred to as the “consensus” or vit-ERE throughout the text. Also the 3′- fos-ERE used for comparative purposes is shown in Ref. 26Hyder S.M. Stancel G.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar. Plasmid constructions and other cloning procedures were done using standard procedures (29Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The construction of YEPE10, a high copy number yeast, expression vectors for ER have been described previously (30McDonnell D.P. Nawaz Z. Densmore C. Weigel N.L. Pham T.A. Clark J.H. O'Malley B.W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 39: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These expression vectors were transformed into yeast strain BJ3505, and transformants were selected by tryptophan prototrophy. Yeast reporter plasmids were constructed as follows. The yeast reporter plasmid YRPE2 was constructed from PLG670Z (31Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) by inserting a 75-base pair oligonucleotide (containing two estrogen-responsive elements) into the unique XhoI site upstream of the CYC1 (iso-1-cytochrome c) promoter. To construct the reporter plasmids, containing the c- jun-ERE-like elements and the mutant jun5 oligodeoxynucleotides, shown in Figs. 1 and 5, either single or double copies were inserted into the BglII site of the plasmid PC3 (32Pham T.A. Hwung Y.P. McDonnell D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18179-18187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The copy number and orientation of the inserted oligodeoxynucleotides were determined by automated DNA sequencing. To analyze the c- jun promoter in yeast for the presence of an ERE, the region between −1000 to −1 base pair from the start site of c- jun message was amplified from the plasmid containing −4500/+874 of the c- jun promoter (33Kitabayashi I. Chiu R. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with primers containing a BglII recognition sequence. The conditions for polymerase chain reaction have been described previously (34Hyder S.M. Hu C. Needleman D. Sonoda Y. Wang X.-Y. Baker V.V. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 478-482PubMed Google Scholar). Following digestion with the enzyme, this fragment was inserted into the BglII site of PC3, and the insert was sequenced for the determination of orientation. Another construct containing −440/−1 region of c- jun promoter was made by digesting the −1000/−1 polymerase chain reaction-amplified product with BamHI and ligating the resulting −440-base pair fragment into BglII-digested PC3 vector. These were also sequenced. For transfection of mammalian cells, the Jun5ERE and the mutant Jun5EREs (Figs. 1 and 4) were inserted into pBLCAT2 (35Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 15: 5490Crossref Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Plasmids were sequenced and reporters containing two copies of the test sequence were selected for transfection studies. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae BJ3505 (MAT a, pep 4::HIS3, prb61-delta 1.6R, His3, Lys2-208, Trp1-delta101, Ura3-52, Ga12, (CUP 1)) was used throughout this study (36Moenle C.M. Ayanardi M.W. Kolodny M.R. Park F.J. Jones E.W. Genetics. 1994; 115: 255-263Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were carried out using the lithium acetate polyethylene glycol transformation protocol (37Itao M. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriology. 1983; 153: 163-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells transformed with the appropriate expression and reporter plasmids were grown overnight at 30°C in selective medium (2% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids autoclaved to destroy endogenous tryptophan, 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, and 24 μg/liter adenine sulfate). This culture was used to inoculate fresh medium at a density of 100,000 cells/ml. The cells were incubated with 2 × 10−6M estradiol. When cells reached an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm, they were harvested and the level of β-galactosidase produced was measured as described previously (38Mak P. McDonnell D.P. Weigel N. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21613-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H301 cells derived from estrogen-induced hamster kidney tumor were kindly provided by Dr. David Sirbasku (39Sirbasku D.A. Kirkland W.L. Endocrinology. 1976; 98: 1260-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection studies H301 cells were plated on day 1 in complete medium. Twenty-four hours prior to transfection the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-treated serum to remove endogenous steroids. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method (11Hyder S.M. Stancel G.M. Nawaz Z. McDonnell D.P. Loose-Mitchell D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18047-18054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 10 μg of the reporter plasmid, 2 μg of the ER expression plasmid (40Elliston J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11517-11521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 2 μg of the β-galctosidase expression plasmid to monitor transfection efficiency. After 6 h cells were shocked with 10% glycerol and then treated with 20 n M estradiol for 24 h. Cells were then collected, lysed, and assayed for CAT activity. Results were corrected for the expression of β-galactosidase activity and calculated for -fold induction of CAT activity in the presence of estradiol compared with control samples not treated with the hormone. As noted in the Introduction, the protooncogene c- jun is rapidly induced by estrogens in the rat uterus in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (17Chiappetta C. Kirkland J.L. Loose-Mitchell D.S. Murthy L. Stancel G.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Weisz A. Cicatiello L. Persicot E. Scalona M. Bresciani F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), suggesting the gene is directly regulated at the transcriptional level by the interaction of the ER and an ERE. As an initial approach to search for potential EREs we examined the region of the rat c- jun gene which has been sequenced (−1388/+4144) for homology to the consensus element GGTCA nnnTGACC (see Fig. 1). This includes approximately 1.4 kb of 5′-flanking sequence, the single jun exon, and 2.2 kb of 3′-flanking sequence as shown in the Fig. 1. From this 5.7-kb region of DNA we selected fragments which had both: (a) a 70% overall homology with the 10 nucleotides in the two arms of the consensus element and (b) either one perfect half-site or 5 of the 6 bases which make important contacts during receptor-DNA binding interactions (42Klein-Hitpass L. Tsai S.Y Greene G.L. Clark J.H. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We developed these criteria since they would allow one to correctly select all the naturally occurring EREs reported (8Anolik J.H. Klinge C.M. Bambara R.A. Hilf R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 713-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This selection identified ten potential EREs: three in the 5′-flanking region, one in the 5′-untranslated region, two in the exon, and four in 3′-regions of the gene as shown in Fig. 1. To test the gene fragments illustrated in Fig. 1 for receptor binding, we synthesized double stranded 27-mer oligodeoxynucleotides containing the potential EREs (Fig. 1) in their naturally occurring contexts for in vitro binding studies. For these measurements we employed a sensitive gel shift competition assay as described previously (26Hyder S.M. Stancel G.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 43Nawaz Z. Stancel G.M. McDonnell D.P. Hyder S.M. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 7: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This assay measures the ability of excess unlabeled test oligodeoxynucleotides to competitively inhibit the binding of the ER to trace amounts of radioactively labeled consensus ERE sequence. As shown in Fig. 2 A we tested the ability of a number of the potential jun EREs to compete for ER binding. Of those sequences tested in Fig. 2 A, only jun5 inhibits the binding of ER to the labeled consensus sequence. This sequence, GCAGA nnnTGACC, which is located in the single exon of the gene as illustrated in Fig. 1, contains one perfect half-site (TGACC), but 3 of 5 bases differ from the consensus sequence in the other half-site (GCAGA versus GGTCA). As also shown in Fig. 2A the unlabeled vit-ERE and the murine c- fos ERE (11Hyder S.M. Stancel G.M. Nawaz Z. McDonnell D.P. Loose-Mitchell D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18047-18054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which were used for positive controls, both compete for ER binding as expected. In addition to the studies shown in Fig. 2 A, similar studies showed that jun2, jun4, and jun6 (see Fig. 1) do not compete for ER binding. Thus, of the 10 potential jun EREs illustrated in Fig. 1, only jun5 is able to bind the ER as judged by the competitive binding assay we utilized. As shown in Fig. 2 A, two specific bands of ER binding to the labeled consensus sequence are observed. In some other experiments only one specific band was observed (data not shown). This is dependent upon the receptor preparation, irrespective of the presence of protease inhibitors in buffers (26Hyder S.M. Stancel G.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additionally a lighter nonspecific band (NS) is observed with some receptor preparations. We have shown previously that the single specific band seen in some preparations is recognized by the antibody ER 715 to the ER (26Hyder S.M. Stancel G.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), thus establishing that the complex contains the hormone receptor. Fig. 2 B indicates that for those preparations exhibiting two bands, both are also recognized by antireceptor antibody. These bands do not appear to represent a monomer-dimer equilibrium, since when two bands are present their ratio remains constant over a 100-fold range of protein concentrations (data not shown). Others have occasionally observed multiple bands with gel shift assays using receptor preparations from the rat uterus (44Curtis S.W. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and multiple species of ER may originate from single transcripts containing two translational start sites (45Claret F.-X. Chapel S. Garcés J. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Bertholet C. Shapiro D.J. Wittek R. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14047-14055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly for these studies both bands contain ER as indicated by the antibody supershifts, and both are competable with excess vit-ERE, fos-ERE, or the potential jun-ERE. The data in Fig. 2A indicate that the jun5 sequence (GCAGA nnnTGACC), which contains one half-site identical to the consensus sequence (GGTCA nnnTGACC), competes with the vit-ERE for receptor binding. We noted, however, that two other jun sequences (jun8 and jun9, Fig. 1) contain this identical half-site but fail to compete for ER binding, thus illustrating that not all sequences containing a perfect half-site compete for the binding of ER. This indicates that additional bases, either in the first half-site or immediately flanking the TGACC motif in jun5 have a significant influence on the ability of the jun5 ERE to bind the ER. The effect of bases immediately flanking this second half-site in jun5 is explored more fully in subsequent experiments (see Fig. 5). Fig. 3 demonstrates that competition of jun5 for ER binding to the labeled vit-ERE is concentration-dependent. Increasing concentrations of both the homologous (vit-ERE) and the heterologous (jun5) oligodeoxynucleotides also show increasing competition for ER binding. In contrast, neither 500- nor 1000-fold excesses of the jun1 sequence, which is used here as a negative control, compete for ER binding. At these relatively high concentration of jun5 oligodeoxynucleotides, we have also noticed some competition for the nonspecific band (Figs. 2 and 3), although any possible significance of this observation is unclear at present. Studies such as those shown in Fig. 3 can also be used to estimate the relative binding affinity of the ER to different EREs (see “Discussion”) Based on these results with a competition assay, we attempted to directly observe the binding of the radioactively labeled jun5 oligodeoxynucleotide with the ER. However, we could not observe a direct binding interaction of this element with the ER despite using several experimental modifications of our basic binding assay (26Hyder S.M. Stancel G.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These modifications included preloading of the receptor with estradiol-17β, increasing the preincubation time of the receptor with the jun5 oligodeoxynucleotide from 15 min to 24 h before electrophoresis, or increasing the protein concentration of the receptor preparations from 10 to 40 μg/sample during the incubation (data not shown). These results indicate that the affinity of the ER for the jun5 sequence is insufficient to maintain complex formation through the electrophoresis step in such direct binding measurements. To further explore the role of specific nucleotides in the ER-jun5 binding interaction, we synthesized a series of oligodeoxynucleotides containing various mutations in the two-half sites and various flanking regions of the element. As shown in Fig. 4, these sequences contain mutations in the GCAGA first half-site (mt1jun5), the TGACC second half-site (mt2jun5), mutations 5′ of the GCAGA half-site (mt3jun5), mutations in the spacer region between the two half sites (mt4jun5), and mutations 3′ of the TGACC half-site (mt5jun5). These sequences were used in the competition studies illustrated in Fig. 5. The overall pattern of mutational effects on ER-jun5 binding (Fig. 5) was somewhat surprising to us. As expected, mutations in the CC dinucleotide of the second half-site (TGACC to TGAtt) led to a loss of receptor binding as evidenced by the lack of competition with mt2jun5. However, mutations in the first half-site of the element (GCAGA to ttAGA) had no observable effect as the mt1jun5 sequence was able to compete as effectively as the jun5 parent element. Similarly, mutations 5′ to the GCAGA half-site (mt3jun5) had no apparent effect on receptor binding. These results indicate that the first half site (GCAGA) of the jun5 element has little, if any, effect on receptor binding, whereas mutations in the TGACC sequence destroy binding.

Previously, we have identified and purified a Gβγ complex composed of a Gβ3isoform and an immunochemically distinct Gγ subunit (Gγ8) from bovine retinal cones (Fung, B. K.-K., Lieberman, B. S., and Lee, R. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 24782-24788; Lee, R. H., Lieberman, B. S., Yamane, H. K., Bok, D., and Fung, B. K.-K. (1992a) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 24776-24781). Based on the partial amino acid sequence of this cone Gγ8, we screened a bovine retinal cDNA library and isolated a cDNA clone encoding Gγ8. The cDNA insert of this clone includes an open reading frame of 207 bases encoding a 69-amino acid protein. The predicted protein sequence of Gγ8shares a high degree of sequence identity (68%) with the Gγ (Gγ1) subunit of rod transducin. Similar to rod Gγ1, it terminates in a CIIS motif that is the site for post-translational modification by farnesylation. Messenger RNA for Gγ8is present at a high level in the retina and at a very low level in the lung, but is undetectable in other tissues. Immunostaining of bovine retinal sections with an antipeptide antibody against the N-terminal region of Gγ8further shows a differential localization of Gγ8to cones with a pattern indistinguishable from that of Gβ3. This finding suggests that Gβ3γ8is a component of cone transducin involved in cone phototransduction and color vision.

This finding suggests that Gβ3γ8is a component of cone transducin involved in cone phototransduction and color vision. The family of structurally homologous G proteins plays an essential role in transducing extracellular signals from cell-surface receptors to intracellular effectors (Stryer and Bourne, 1986Stryer L. Bourne H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 391-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar; Gilman, 1987Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev.

Members of this group of proteins are heterotrimers composed of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits. In most biological systems, the Gα subunits are generally recognized as the signal carrier that dictates the specificity of signaling pathways. The Gβ and Gγ subunits, which form a tightly associated Gβγ complex, usually play a more passive role by promoting interactions between the Gα subunit and the receptor (Fung, 1983Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Florio and Sternweis, 1985Florio V.A. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3477-3483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is now a growing body of evidence demonstrating that Gβγ also participates in a wide range of other G protein functions in some systems. These include the promotion of cholera toxin- and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the Gα subunit (Yamane and Fung, 1993Yamane H.K. Fung B.K.-K. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1993; 32: 201-241Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), interaction with phosducin (Lee et al., 1987Lee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Lolley R.N.

Neer E.J. Nature. 1993; 365: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which the Gβγ complex regulates a diversity of signaling processes is still not fully understood. To date, five forms of Gβ (Watson et al., 1994Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and multiple forms of Gγ subunits have been identified by biochemical, immunological, and molecular cloning studies (Simon et al., 1991Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). At the amino acid level, the Gβ subunits are highly conserved. In contrast, the Gγ subunits are more divergent. Because of the diversity of the Gγ sequences, it is generally believed that the Gγ subunit determines the functional specificity of the Gβγ complex. However, it is unclear what combinations of Gβ and Gγ subunits occur physiologically to account for the differences in their functions. The Gβγ complexes isolated from most tissue preparations are heterogeneous mixtures containing different forms of Gβ and Gγ subunits (Gautam et al., 1990Gautam N. Northup J. Tamir H. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7973-7977Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). An exception to this is the cone Gβγ complex, which is composed of Gβ3and a novel Gγ subunit (Fung et al., 1992Fung B.K.-K. Lieberman B.S. Lee R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24782-24788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Lee et al., 1992aLee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Yamane H.K. Bok D. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol.

We further show that this Gγ subunit is highly homologous to the Gγ1subunit of rod transducin (Hurley et al., 1984Hurley J.B. Fong H.K. Teplow D.B. Dreyer W.J. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following the convention of naming the G protein subunits numerically, we will refer to this newly identified cone Gγ subunit as Gγ8in this paper. We speculate that Gγ8may serve an important function in the regulation of phototransduction in cones. Retinal G protein (transducin) Gβγ complex was isolated from bovine retinas purchased from J. A. Lawson (Lincoln, NE) (Fung, 1983Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10495-10502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cone-specific Gβ3γ8complex was separated from rod-specific Gβ1γ1by subtractive chromatography using an affinity column of immobilized monoclonal antibodies against rod Gγ1as reported previously (Fung et al., 1992Fung B.K.-K. Lieberman B.S. Lee R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24782-24788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bovine retinal cDNA library in Uni-Zap XR was a gift from Dr. Wolfgang Baehr (Baylor College of Medicine), and Ha-Ras cDNA in the pTrcA vector (Invitrogen) was obtained from Dr. Vincent Jung (Cold Spring Harbor).

The IgG fraction of the antiserum was purified by chromatography on a DEAE-Affi-Gel blue column (Bio-Rad). The purified Gβ3γ8com-plex was separated on high resolution Tricine-polyacrylamide gels (Schägger and von Jagow, 1987Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), transblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue (Matsudaira, 1987Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The region of the membranes containing the Gγ8subunit was excised, cleaved with cyanogen bromide, and subjected to gas-phase protein sequence analysis at the Protein Sequencing Facility, University of California, Los Angeles. Degenerate PCR oligonucleotide primers corresponding to residues KKEVKN (5′-primer) and KGIPED (3′-primer) were designed from the partial amino acid sequence of Gγ8. PCR mixtures were prepared in 50 μl containing 1 × PCR buffer (10 m M Tris, pH 8.3, 50 m M KCl, 1.5 m M MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin), 1 μM degenerate primers, 50 μM dNTPs, and 0.5 μl (2.5 × 105plaque-forming units) of bovine retinal cDNA library in Uni-Zap XR. Reactions were performed for five cycles with melting, annealing, and extension at temperatures of 94, 37, and 72°C, respectively, followed by 25 cycles with an annealing temperature of 52°C. A PCR product of ∼150 base pairs was obtained, and the amplified cDNA fragment was excised from an agarose gel, purified, and ligated to the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The isolated cDNA clone was sequenced to confirm that it corresponds to the nucleotide sequence predicted from the partial amino acid sequence of Gγ8. A [32P]CTP-labeled mRNA probe was then synthesized from the vector and used to screen 3 × 105plaques at 50°C. The Bluescript plasmids containing the desired insert were rescued from the positive phagemid preparation according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). A fragment of Gγ8cDNA from base pairs 2 to 429 shown in Fig. 1 was amplified by PCR and ligated into the pT7 blue vector (Novagen). The cDNA insert was excised at the NdeI and BamHI sites, subcloned into the pET-16b expression vector (Novagen), and expressed as a fusion protein containing a histidine-rich N-terminal sequence and a Factor Xa cleavage site. Isoprenyl-β- D-thiogalactopyranoside induction and extraction of the Gγ8fusion protein were carried out according to the procedure provided by the manufacturer. The bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 20 min and applied to a 1-ml column of His-Bind resin (Novagen). Bound Gγ8fusion protein was eluted from the column with 20 m M Tris, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, 100 m M EDTA. The protein eluents were pooled; dialyzed for 4 h against 50 m M Tris, pH 8.0, 100 m M NaCl, 1 m M CaCl2; and digested with Factor Xa for 4 h at room temperature at a protease/protein ratio of 1:60 (w/w). Immediately following proteolysis, Gγ8was further purified on a Superose-12 column. The resulting Gγ8is structurally similar to the native protein, except for the replacement of N-terminal MA residues with HMDLA residues. In vitro isoprenylation of recombinant Gγ8, Rac2, or Ha-Ras protein was carried out at 37°C in a final volume of 25 μl of buffer (50 m M Tris, pH 7.5, 20 m M KCl, 5 m M MgCl2, 0.5 m M dithiothreitol). The reaction mixture for farnesylation contained 1.5 μM purified protein, 2 μM [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate (15 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals), 20 μM geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and 4 μl of nuclease-treated rabbit reticulolysate (Promega). Geranylgeranylation was carried out under the same conditions, except that the [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate were replaced with [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (40 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and farnesyl pyrophosphate, respectively. After 1 h of incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the proteins were separated on high resolution Tricine-polyacrylamide gels. To quantify the amount of radioactivity, regions of the gel containing Gγ8, Rac2, or Ha-Ras were excised; digested in 20% H2O2at 65°C overnight; and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Total RNA from bovine retina was isolated by acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA from other frozen bovine tissues was prepared by guanidinium thiocyanate extraction and LiCl precipitation (Cathala et al., 1983Cathala G. Savouret J.F. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA (N. Y.). 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar), and poly(A)+RNA was further purified by binding to oligo(dT)-cellulose columns. The RNA samples were electrophoresed on 0.9% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Hybridization with nick-translated bovine Gγ8cDNA (106cpm/ml) and human Gα11cDNA (106cpm/ml) probes was carried out for 24 h at 38°C in buffer containing 50% formaldehyde, 5 × SSC, 50 m M NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 2 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 50 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The final washing of the membranes was performed in a solution containing 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42°C for 30 min. Autoradiography was carried out by exposure to Kodak X-Omat AR film for 42 h at −80°C using an intensifying screen. Fresh bovine eyes were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and the cornea, iris, lens, and vitreous body were removed. The remaining eyecup was fixed at 4°C for 4 days by immersion in 4% formaldehyde freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde. Strips of retina attached to the underlying choroidal layer were dissected from the scleral layer and infiltrated for 12 h in 30% sucrose. The infiltrated strips were then immersed in Tissue-Tec O.C.T. compound (Miles Inc.), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Frozen sections of the tissues were cut at 7-9 μm on a Reichert-Jung 2800 Frigcut cryostat, transferred to slides coated with aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Aldrich), and stained using the avidin-biotinylated enzyme complex technique according to instructions provided by the supplier (Pierce). All staining was performed at 21°C in a humidified chamber, and preimmune controls were treated alongside the experimental sections. The experimental and control sections were incubated for 45 min in purified IgG at a concentration of A280 nm= 0.01 A units, for 30 min in goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and for 30 min in avidin-biotin complex. To visualize the cell bodies, the sections were counterstained for 1 min in Mayer's hematoxylin. Sections were viewed in a Zeiss PM III photomicroscope and photographed with Kodak Ektachrome 50T film. Protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie Blue binding (Bradford, 1976Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using γ-globulin as a standard. SDS-PAGE of proteins was performed by the method of Schägger and von Jagow, 1987Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar (16.5% separation gel in Tricine buffer). Western blotting of proteins on Immobilon-P membranes was carried out according to a modified procedure of Towbin et al., 1979Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar. After sequential incubation of the membranes with 5% bovine serum albumin, primary antibodies, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Boehringer Mannheim), the immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence with the ECL Western blotting reagent (Amersham Corp.). We have previously reported the purification of a cone Gβγ complex composed of Gβ3and an immunochemically distinct Gγ subunit (Fung et al., 1992Fung B.K.-K. Lieberman B.S. Lee R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24782-24788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Lee et al., 1992aLee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Yamane H.K. Bok D. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24776-24781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis of this cone Gγ peptide obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage revealed an internal amino acid sequence that differs from all other known Gγ subunits. To obtain the complete sequence of cone Gγ, we first amplified from a bovine retinal cDNA library a fragment of this cDNA by PCR using a set of degenerate oligonucleotide primers derived from amino acid sequence information. We then used this PCR fragment as a probe to screen the cDNA library and isolated one clone containing the entire coding region of this cone Gγ. Sequence analysis of the cDNA insert of the clone revealed a 207-base pair open reading frame encoding a 69-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 7700 Da (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence matches perfectly with the sequence of the cyanogen bromide-generated peptides, indicating that the cDNA encodes cone Gγ. This newly identified Gγ was subsequently named Gγ8. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of Gγ8and other known sequences of Gγ subunits is shown in Fig. 2. As expected for a cone G protein subunit, Gγ8shares the strongest sequence identity (68%) with Gγ1of retinal rod transducin. The differences between these two forms are concentrated at the N-terminal region and in the region between residues 22 and 33 of Gγ8. In contrast, Gγ8exhibits a lesser degree of sequence identity to other forms of Gγ subunits, ranging from 30% (for Gγ5) to 39% (for Gγ2and Gγ7). Like other members of the family, the Gγ8subunit terminates with a C XXX motif (where C = cysteine and X = any amino acid), which has been shown in Gγ1(Fukada et al., 1990Fukada Y. Takao T. Ohguro H. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1990; 346: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar; Lai et al., 1990Lai R.K. Perez-Sala D. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and brain Gγ (Mumby et al., 1990Mumby S.M. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar; Yamane et al., 1990Yamane H.K. Farnsworth C.C. Xie H.Y. Howald W. Fung B.K. Clarke S. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A. 1990; 87: 5868-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) to be the signal sequence for multiple post-translational modifications, including isoprenylation, proteolysis, and carboxyl methylation. To examine the tissue distribution of the Gγ8mRNA, we carried out Northern blot analysis of total RNA from bovine retina and poly(A)+-enriched RNA from several other bovine tissues. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the Gγ8probe recognized a 2.3-kilobase mRNA transcript, which is expressed in the retina, and a 2.9-kilobase mRNA transcript, which is present at a very low level in the lung. All other tissues tested, however, do not show a detectable level of Gγ8message. When the same blot was hybridized to the probe derived from human Gα11cDNA as a control (Jiang et al., 1991Jiang M. Pandey S. Tran V.T. Fong H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3907-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a 3.8-kilobase transcript of Gα11mRNA was readily detected in all preparations of tissue poly(A)+RNA (Fig. 3 B). This result indicates that mRNA of Gγ8is predominantly expressed in retinas. The presence of a CIIS motif at the C terminus of Gγ8suggests that it may be post-translationally modified by isoprenylation. To explore this possibility, we determined the ability of recombinant Gγ8to incorporate radiolabeled isoprenoid groups. Recombinant Gγ8containing a histidine-rich N-terminal sequence was expressed as a fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography. The purity of the fusion protein obtained was >90% as estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of the purified proteins separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). This purified fusion protein was digested with Factor Xa to remove the N-terminal histidine-tagged sequence, and recombinant Gγ8generated from the proteolysis was separated from Factor Xa by gel filtration on a Superose-12 column (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). In vitro isoprenylation of recombinant Gγ8was carried out in rabbit reticulolysate in the presence of either [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate or [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Recombinant Ha-Ras and Rac2 proteins, previously shown to be farnesylated and geranylgeranylated, respectively (Casey et al., 1989Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar; Kinsella et al., 1991aKinsella B.T. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9786-9794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were used as controls to test the labeling reaction. Compared with [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, incubation in the presence of [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate results in the incorporation of 8.3- and 23-fold higher levels of radioactivity into Gγ8and Ha-Ras, respectively (Table I). The lower efficiency in labeling of Gγ8relative to Ha-Ras may be due to dimerization of the Gγ8subunit in the absence of the Gβ3subunit (see Fig. 4 and below). In contrast, the labeling of Rac2 protein with a CSLL motif is 63-fold greater in the presence of [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate compared with [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Gγ8is modified by farnesylation. It is noteworthy that Gγ1, which is highly homologous to Gγ8, is also farnesylated (Fukada et al., 1990Fukada Y. Takao T. Ohguro H. Yoshizawa T. Akino T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1990; 346: 658-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar; Lai et al., 1990Lai R.K. Perez-Sala D. Canada F.J. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7673-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar; Fung et al., 1994Fung B.K.-K. Anant J.S. Lin W.-C. Ong O.C. Yamane H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). On the other hand, geranylgeranylation has been shown to occur in Gγ2, a less homologous form found in the brain (Mumby et al., 1990Mumby S.M. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar; Yamane et al., 1990Yamane H.K. Farnsworth C.C. Xie H.Y. Howald W. Fung B.K. Clarke S. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5868-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Evidence based on previous studies indicates that the specificity of the isoprenylation is dictated by the carboxyl residue of the C XXX sequence (Kinsella et al., 1991bKinsella B.T. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8934-8938Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar; Reiss et al., 1991Reiss Y. Stradley S.J. Gierasch L.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, both Gγ1and Gγ8, which are farnesylated, terminate in a serine residue at the carboxyl terminus, whereas a leucine residue is present at the carboxyl terminus of all other forms of geranylgeranylated Gγ subunits.Table I:Isoprenylation of Gγ8Table I:Isoprenylation of Gγ8 Specific antiserum was generated against the synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1-14 of the deduced amino acid sequence of Gγ8. To test the specificity of the antiserum, we purified bovine retinal rod-specific Gβ1γ and cone-specific Gβ3γ and carried out immunoblot analysis of these proteins with the antipeptide antiserum. As shown in the autoradiogram in Fig. 4 A, the antiserum specifically recognizes the Gγ subunit from the Gβ3γ preparation (lane 1), but not the Gγ subunit from the purified Gβ1γ complex (lane 2). The antiserum also recognizes recombinant Gγ8expressed in E. coli, which was used in the isoprenylation experiments. As shown in the immunoblot in Fig. 4B, the Gγ8fusion product containing the N-terminal histidine-rich residues (lane 3) as well as Gγ8generated following Factor Xa cleavage (lane 4) are detectable with the antipeptide antiserum. The antiserum is also immunoreactive to a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa present in the Factor Xa-treated preparation. Since this immunoreactive peptide appears only after cleavage with Factor Xa protease and the antiserum did not cross-react with Factor Xa (data not shown), the 16-kDa polypeptide is most likely a product of the irreversible dimerization of recombinant Gγ8after the histidine-tagged residues were removed. To investigate whether Gγ8is specifically localized to cone photoreceptors, bovine retinal sections were stained with antiserum raised against the N-terminal peptide of Gγ8. As shown in Fig. 5, the immunostaining was exclusively observed in cones. The bovine retinal sections incubated with the antiserum show staining in the cone outer segments, the myoid region of inner segments, cone cell bodies, axons, and synaptic terminals. The most intense staining was found in the outer segments. In the retinal sections treated with the preimmune serum, however, no staining was observed in these regions. These findings confirmed that Gγ8is specifically localized in cone photoreceptors within the retina and raise the possibility that it is the Gγ subunit of cone transducin involved in phototransduction and color vision. The phototransduction process in the vertebrate retina takes place in the outer segments of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Rods are remarkably sensitive and can detect a single photon, but their response is easily saturated at higher light intensity (Pugh and Cobbs, 1986Pugh Jr., E. Cobbs W.H. Vision Res. 1986; 26: 1613-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Compared with rods, cones are 100-fold less sensitive to light, but display a faster and shorter response (Pugh and Cobbs, 1986Pugh Jr., E. Cobbs W.H. Vision Res. 1986; 26: 1613-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar; Nakatani and Yau, 1986Nakatani K. Yau K.-W. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1986; 27: 300Google Scholar). They are also less easily saturable than rods. The mechanisms underlying the differences in sensitivity and transduction kinetics between these two types of photoreceptors have been proposed to reside in the biochemistry of the transduction process (Yau, 1994Yau K.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vision Sci. 1994; 35: 9-32PubMed Google Scholar). In rods, a retina-specific G protein (transducin) couples the photoexcitation of rhodopsin to the activation of retinal cGMP phosphodiesterase (Fung, 1986Fung B.K.-K. Prog. Retinal Res. 1986; 6: 151-177Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar; Lolley and Lee, 1990Lolley R.N. Lee R.H. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; Stryer, 1991Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10711-10714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting change in the intracellular cGMP level leads to the closure of cGMP-sensitive cation channels and the hyperpolarization of the rod (Pugh and Cobbs, 1986Pugh Jr., E. Cobbs W.H. Vision Res. 1986; 26: 1613-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although the phototransduction mechanism of cones is less well characterized, electrophysiological studies have detected similar types of cGMP-regulated cation channels in the plasma membranes of the cone outer segments (Haynes and Yau, 1985Haynes L. Yau K.W. Nature. 1985; 317: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar; Cobbs et al., 1985Cobbs W.H. Barkdoll III, A.E. Pugh Jr., E. Nature. 1985; 317: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, GTP is required in order for light to close the cGMP-regulated channels, suggesting a direct involvement of a G protein in the cone phototransduction pathway (Nakatani and Yau, 1986Nakatani K. Yau K.-W. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1986; 27: 300Google Scholar). At the molecular level, the cone-specific Gα subunit (Lerea et al., 1986Lerea C.L. Somers D.E. Hurley J.B. Klock I.B. Bunt-Milam A.H. Science. 1986; 234: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), cGMP phosphodiesterase (Gillespie and Beavo, 1988Gillespie P.G. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

A. 1990; 87: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the cGMP-regulated channel (Bonigk et al., 1993Bonigk W. Altenhofen W. Muller F. Dose A. Illing M. Molday R.S. Kaupp U.B. Neuron. 1993; 10: 865-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) have been identified, and a Gβγ complex composed of Gβ3and an immunochemically distinct Gγ subunit has also been purified from bovine retinal cones (Fung et al., 1992Fung B.K.-K. Lieberman B.S. Lee R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24782-24788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Lee et al., 1992aLee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Yamane H.K. Bok D. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24776-24781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences of these cone-specific proteins are all highly homologous to those of their corresponding rod-specific counterparts, strongly suggesting that they are the key components of the cone phototransduction machinery. In an effort to identify the Gγ subunit that associates with Gβ3in retinal cones, we screened a bovine retinal cDNA library and isolated a cDNA clone encoding Gγ8. The predicted protein sequence for Gγ8suggests that it represents a new isoform of the Gγ subunit family. Sequence comparison further reveals that Gγ8shares a relatively higher degree of homology with Gγ1(68% sequence identity) than with other known isoforms of Gγ subunits (ranging from 30 to 39% identity). The similarity in structure between Gγ8and Gγ1strongly implies that, like Gγ1in rods, Gγ8may play a role in cone phototransduction. To address the question of whether Gγ8is differentially localized to one type of photoreceptor in the retina, we generated a rabbit antipeptide antibody against the N-terminal region of Gγ8and performed immunocytochemistry on the sections of bovine retina. The result shows that Gγ8, like its molecular partner Gβ3, is present only in cones. Our immunostaining data also show a distinct distribution of Gγ8in the outer segments, inner segments, cell bodies, axons, and synaptic terminals, with the highest staining intensity in the outer segments. This immunostaining pattern of Gγ8in cones is indistinguishable from the staining pattern obtained by using a Gβ3-specific antipeptide antibody (Lee et al., 1992aLee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Yamane H.K. Bok D. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24776-24781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Gβ3and Gγ8form a physiologically functional complex in all of these regions in cones. Peng et al., 1992Peng Y.-W. Robishaw J.D. Levine M.A. Yau K.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10882-10886Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar have previously reported that antipeptide antibodies directed against peptides corresponding to residues 2-14 and 36-46 of Gγ2also stained exclusively the cone outer segment, suggesting that Gγ2is also localized in cones. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of Gγ8and Gγ2eliminates the possibility that these antibodies simply cross-reacted with Gγ8. Since Gβ1and Gβ2are both absent in the cone outer segment (Lee et al., 1992aLee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Yamane H.K. Bok D. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24776-24781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Peng et al., 1992Peng Y.-W. Robishaw J.D. Levine M.A. Yau K.-W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1992; 89: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it seems possible that Gγ2may be associated with other forms of Gβ subunits (von Weizsacker et al., 1992von Weizsacker E. Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar; Watson et al., 1994Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the Gγ1subunit of rod transducin, Gγ8is found to be post-translationally modified by farnesylation. This is in contrast to the Gγ subunits of the brain G proteins, which are modified by geranylgeranylation (Mumby et al., 1990Mumby S.M. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar; Yamane et al., 1990Yamane H.K. Farnsworth C.C. Xie H.Y. Howald W. Fung B.K. Clarke S. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Proc.

Since the farnesyl groups are less hydrophobic than geranylgeranyl groups, farnesylated Gγ8is likely to associate only loosely with the disc membranes. Consistent with this finding, the Gβ3γ complex can be readily eluted from cone membranes at low ionic strength (Lee et al., 1992aLee R.H. Lieberman B.S. Yamane H.K. Bok D. Fung B.K.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24776-24781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the majority of the protein was found in the supernatant during isolation. In contrast, brain Gβγ protein containing a more hydrophobic geranylgeranyl group can be extracted only in the presence of detergents (Eide et al., 1987Eide B. Gierschik P. Milligan G. Mullaney I. Unson C. Goldsmith P. Spiegel A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition to membrane anchorage, the isoprenyl group of the Gγ subunit may have other biological functions. In the rod phototransduction pathway, the carboxyl-terminal peptides of Gγ1containing a chemically attached farnesyl group appear to stabilize metarhodospin II and to uncouple rhodopsin-transducin interaction (Kisselev et al., 1994Kisselev O.G. Ermolaeva M.V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21399-21402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methylation of the farnesyl cysteine in Gγ1also facilitates the interaction of transducin with rhodopsin (Fukada et al., 1994Fukada Y. Matsuda T. Kokame K. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Akino T. Yoshizawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5163-5170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since all other Gγ subunits except those in photoreceptors are shown or predicted to be modified by geranylgeranylation, we speculate that the farnesylation of Gγ8may indicate a specific functional requirement for the phototransduction pathway in cones. With the cloning of the Gγ8subunit reported here, we believe that all the key protein components of the cone phototransduction machinery are now in hand. It may soon be possible to produce all the protein components of the cGMP cascade in a suitable eukaryotic expression system, to reconstitute the cone phototransduction pathway in vitro, and to study the chemical properties of each component in detail. The future challenge is to describe quantitatively the entire phototransduction process and to provide an explanation for the kinetic and sensitivity differences between rods and cones.

Extensive genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have indicated the requirement of 11 genes, RAD1, RAD2, RAD3, RAD4, RAD7, RAD10, RAD14, RAD16, RAD23, RAD25, and MMS19 in nucleotide excision repair (NER). 1The abbreviations used are:NERnucleotide excision repairMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are:NERnucleotide excision repairMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Among these genes, RAD3 and RAD25 are of particular interest because in addition to their role in NER, they are essential for cell viability (1Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Studies with temperature-sensitive conditional lethal mutations have indicated a direct and essential role of RAD3 and RAD25 in RNA polymerase II transcription (2Guzder S.N. Qiu H. Sommers C.H.

Both RAD3 and RAD25 proteins contain single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase activities (3Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S.

Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In contrast, the DNA helicase activity of RAD25 is essential for both transcription and DNA repair (3Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Qiu H. Park E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2161-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). RAD3 and RAD25 are components of the yeast polymerase II general transcription factor TFIIH. In addition, TFIIH contains four other subunits of 75, 55, 50, and 38 kDa (8Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q.

TFB1 and SSL1 encode the 75- and 50-kDa subunits, whereas the genes for the 55- and 38-kDa subunits have not yet been identified. A role of TFIIH in NER has been inferred from the observation that TFIIH corrects the NER defect in rad3 and rad25 mutant extracts (9Wang Z. Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Wu X. Kornberg R.D.

Recognition of DNA damage represents the first crucial step in NER. We have previously shown that RAD14, a zinc metalloprotein, binds specifically to ultraviolet-damaged DNA (10Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RAD3 also binds preferentially to UV-damaged DNA in a manner dependent upon ATP and negative superhelicity (11Sung P. Watkins J.F. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8303-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rad3 Arg-48 mutant protein defective in DNA helicase activity also binds UV damaged DNA like the wild type RAD3 protein, indicating that DNA helicase activity and damage binding are two distinct and separable functions in RAD3 (11Sung P. Watkins J.F. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8303-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because RAD3 is a damage recognition protein, it is important to determine how TFIIH is assembled with RAD14 2We have observed that the RAD14 gene contains an intron, representing the first example of an intron in an S. cerevisiae DNA repair gene. RAD14 encodes a protein of 371 amino acids with a predicted size of 43 kDa, and RAD14 immunoprecipitated from RAD+ cells exhibits a size of 48 kDa in SDS-PAGE. The translation-initiating ATG codon in RAD14 is at position −456 in the previously reported sequence (19Bankmann M. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1992; 355: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and an 84-base pair intron occurs between positions −429 and −346 (19Bankmann M. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1992; 355: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The presence of the intron was confirmed by sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction product of poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from wild type and rna2-1 strains held at 25°C or at 37°C for 1 h. 2We have observed that the RAD14 gene contains an intron, representing the first example of an intron in an S. cerevisiae DNA repair gene.

Here, we show that TFIIH is complexed with RAD14 via the RAD23 protein. We discuss the possible role of this complex in NER. Antibodies to RAD3 (6Sung P. Prakash L. Weber S. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6045-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), RAD14 (10Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and RAD25 (3Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) were raised in rabbits as described. Antibodies to TFB1 were raised against a GST-TFB1 hybrid protein (13Gileadi O. Feaver W.J. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1992; 257: 1389-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) that was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from inclusion bodies by preparative denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All the antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography as described (14Bailly V. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8273-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Yeast extracts were prepared in buffer B (50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 m M NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) using a French press as described previously (14Bailly V. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8273-8277Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Extract from 0.7 g of cells was mixed for 60 min at 25°C with 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads containing 3 mg/ml of covalently conjugated anti-RAD14 antibodies or non-immune IgG. After being washed twice with 600 μl of buffer B, bound proteins were eluted from the immunoprecipitate by a 5-min treatment with 70 μl of 2% SDS at 42°C, and 10 μl of the SDS eluates were analyzed by immunoblotting. RAD23 protein (2 mg) was dialyzed against 1 liter of coupling buffer (0.1 M MOPS, pH 7.5) at 4°C for 12 h. Affi-Gel 15 matrix (Bio-Rad), 0.5 ml, previously washed with cold water, was mixed with purified RAD23 protein in a final volume of 1 ml overnight at 4°C. The unreacted active groups on the matrix were blocked by incubation with 1 M ethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 4 h at 4°C. Bovine serum albumin (4 mg) was coupled to Affi-Gel 15 using the same procedure. 35S-Labeled RAD3, RAD14, RAD25, and TFB1 proteins were obtained by coupled in vitro transcription and translation in 50-μl reactions containing 40 μCi of [35S]methionine with the use of the TNT T7 reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The 35S-labeled translation products were partially purified by precipitation with 50% ammonium sulfate (0.31 g/ml). The protein pellet was dissolved in 50 μl buffer A (20 m M HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 70 m M KCl, 5 m M sodium bisulfite, 4 m M MgCl2, 0.5 m M EDTA, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2.5% glycerol). A 10-μl aliquot of the protein solution was mixed with 90 μl of buffer A and 10 μl of BSA-Affi-Gel or RAD23-Affi-Gel beads for 30 min at 25°C. After washing with 500 μl of ice-cold buffer A, bound proteins were eluted from the beads with the use of 2% SDS and fractionated in 9% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and subjected to fluorography. Extract was prepared from 80 g of the rad23Δ yeast strain JWY36 with the use of a French press and passed through a Bio-Rex 70 column (1.6 × 8 cm) as described (15Sayer M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23376-23382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After washing the Bio-Rex 70 column with buffer A containing 300 m M KOAc, TFIIH and other proteins were eluted with 600 m M KOAc (15Sayer M.H. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23376-23382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to the protein peak were pooled (5 ml), concentrated to 2 ml in a Centricon-30 (Amicon), and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of buffer C (50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m M EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 m M dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors containing 50 m M KOAc). RAD23-Affi-Gel and BSA-Affi-Gel, 0.15 ml each, were packed in a 1-ml pipette tip plugged with glass wool and 1 ml of the dialyzed TFIIH pool was passed through the RAD23 affinity column or the BSA control column twice at 25°C. The columns were eluted with 0.45 ml of 0.2 M, 0.5 M, 1 M, and 2 M KOAc in buffer C, collecting two 0.225-ml fractions during each elution step. Five μl of the starting Bio-Rex 70 TFIIH pool of the flow-through fraction from the RAD23-Affi-Gel and BSA-Affi-Gel columns and of the various salt eluates were examined for their content of the RAD25, RAD3, and the TFB1 proteins. Extracts for transcription were prepared as described previously (16Woontner M. Wade P.A. Bonner J. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The template for transcription, pSL187, contains the promoter of the yeast CYC1 gene and yields transcripts of 375 and 350 nucleotides (17Koleske A. Buratowski S. Nonet M. Young R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 883-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were assembled and processed as described (2Guzder S.N. Qiu H. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 367: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To investigate whether RAD14 protein forms a complex with TFIIH, affinity-purified antibodies to RAD14 (10Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) were covalently conjugated to protein A-agarose, and the resulting immunobeads were mixed with wild type RAD+ yeast extract at 25°C for 60 min to bind RAD14 and proteins that are associated with RAD14. As control, the extract was also incubated with protein A-agarose beads containing non-immune IgG. After washing the immunoprecipitates with a large volume of buffer, bound proteins were eluted with SDS and analyzed by immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies for RAD14 and the TFIIH components RAD3, RAD25, and TFB1. We found that the amount of the TFIIH components associated with the anti-RAD14 immunobeads was ≈6-fold higher than the background level of these components in the control (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, another NER protein, RAD23 (1Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 12Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), also co-precipitated specifically with RAD14, as the level of RAD23 in the anti-RAD14 immunoprecipitate was ≈6-fold higher than the control (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest the existence of a higher order protein complex in wild type yeast cells consisting of TFIIH, RAD14, and RAD23. Mutations in the RAD23 gene greatly compromise the efficiency of NER (18Miller R.D. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1982; 188: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and we have previously suggested that RAD23 protein is a non-catalytic NER component that could act in the assembly of a functional nucleotide excision repair complex (1Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 12Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To directly test this possibility, we carried out anti-RAD14 immunoprecipitation using extracts prepared from a yeast strain lacking the genomic RAD23 gene. In the absence of RAD23 protein, as in the case of rad23Δ extract, the amount of TFB1, RAD3, and RAD25 proteins bound in the anti-RAD14 immunoprecipitate was only slightly higher (20-40%) than the background level of these proteins that were associated nonspecifically with beads containing the non-immune IgG (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1 and 2). Thus, co-precipitation of TFIIH with RAD14 protein is strongly dependent on the RAD23 protein, lending support to the notion that efficient assembly of the complex of NER proteins requires the RAD23 protein. To further establish the role of RAD23 in complex formation, we purified this protein from yeast cells. To facilitate the purification, the RAD23 gene was joined to the highly expressed yeast ADC1 promoter to yield the multicopy plasmid pJW112 (2μ,ADC1-RAD23). Purification of RAD23 from the protease-deficient yeast strain LP2749-9B harboring pJW112 was achieved by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatographic fractionation in columns of Q-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, and Mono Q. The purified RAD23 protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue, which revealed that the protein preparation was nearly homogeneous (Fig. 2A). We obtained 5 mg of RAD23 protein from 200 g of starting yeast paste. With the use of nitrocellulose filter DNA binding assay and DNA mobility shift assay in agarose gels, using a wide pH range, we found no interaction of RAD23 protein with DNA. We also found no ATPase or nuclease activity in RAD23. Our immunoprecipitation studies indicated that RAD23 is part of a higher order complex of excision repair proteins and TFIIH and that it in fact promotes the assembly of this protein complex. To determine whether RAD23 contacts TFIIH and RAD14 directly or does so via some other protein component(s), we covalently conjugated purified RAD23 protein to Affi-Gel-15 and used the resulting RAD23 matrix as affinity beads for binding 35S-labeled TFB1, RAD3, RAD25, and RAD14 proteins. To obtain radiolabeled proteins for this work, the protein coding frames of the TFB1, RAD3, RAD25, and RAD14 genes were placed under the bacteriophage T7 promoter, and the resulting constructs were transcribed in vitro to obtain mRNAs that code for these proteins, followed by translation of the mRNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled proteins thus obtained were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, dissolved in reaction buffer, and mixed with the RAD23 Affi-Gel-15 beads. Affinity binding to the RAD23 matrix was allowed to proceed at 25°C for 30 min. After washing with binding buffer, the bound 35S-labeled proteins were eluted from the RAD23 Affi-Gel beads with the use of SDS and revealed by fluorography after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As a control in these experiments, we also mixed the 35S-labeled proteins with Affi-Gel-15 beads containing per unit volume of matrix an amount of BSA twice that of RAD23 used. The BSA beads were treated with SDS, and the eluates were run in polyacrylamide gels alongside the SDS eluates from the RAD23 beads. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the level of the 35S-labeled TFB1 and RAD14 proteins in the SDS eluates from the RAD23 affinity beads was ∼10- and ∼7-fold, respectively, of that in the BSA control, indicating a specific and direct interaction of TFB1 and RAD14 with RAD23. The amount of 35S-labeled RAD25 protein bound to the RAD23 beads was about 3-fold higher than to the BSA beads, suggesting an interaction between RAD25 and RAD23 proteins as well (Fig. 2B). Reproducibly, in three separate experiments (Fig. 2B and data not shown), the level of RAD3 bound to the RAD23 beads was the same as that found in the control, indicating that these two proteins do not interact directly. To obtain further evidence that RAD23 and TFIIH interact physically, a Bio-Rex 70 column fraction derived from rad23Δ extract that was enriched in TFIIH was passed through a column of RAD23 Affi-Gel-15, and BSA Affi-Gel-15 was used as a control. The RAD23 column and control BSA column were washed with buffer and then eluted with 0.2 M, 0.5 M, 1 M, and 2 M potassium acetate, and the content of the TFIIH components RAD3, RAD25, and TFB1 in the various salt washes was examined by immunoblotting. The results from this analysis indicate that a sizable proportion (>70%) of TFB1, RAD3, and RAD25 proteins were retained on the RAD23-Affi-Gel column and that these proteins are eluted from the RAD23 column from 0.2-2 M acetate (Fig. 3A). Only a trace amount of these proteins bound nonselectively to the control BSA column, and all of the retained proteins were readily eluted by 0.2 M acetate (Fig. 3A). We have previously described conditional lethal mutations of RAD3 and RAD25 which result in defective RNA polymerase II transcription at the restrictive temperature both in vivo and in vitro (2Guzder S.N. Qiu H. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 367: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S.

As shown in Fig. 3B, the transcriptional defect in the rad3-ts14 and the rad25-ts24 extracts can be complemented specifically by the eluate from the RAD23 affinity column. These results are again consistent with interaction of TFIIH with the RAD23 protein. The cloning of the RAD14 and RAD23 genes allowed us to determine whether they are essential for cell viability besides their known role in nucleotide excision repair. Yeast strains bearing genomic deletions of these genes show no notable growth deficiency at 30°C (12Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 19Bankmann M. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1992; 355: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or at 37°C, 3S. N. Guzder, V. Bailly, P. Sung, L. Prakash, and S. Prakash, unpublished observations. indicating that they are likely not required for RNA polymerase II transcription. In agreement with the genetic data, we found that extracts prepared from the rad14Δ and the rad23Δ strains are as proficient in RNA polymerase II transcription as the wild type extract, regardless of whether the mutant extracts were subjected to high temperature treatment at 37°C for 5 min prior to the transcription reaction (Fig. 4). The requirement for RAD14 and RAD23 proteins in NER, but not in RNA polymerase II transcription, stands in contrast with RAD3 and RAD25 proteins, which we have shown to be indispensable for either process (2Guzder S.N. Qiu H. Sommers C.H. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 367: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Guzder S. Sung P. Bailly V. Prakash L. Prakash S.

Yeast TFIIH consists of RAD3, RAD25, TFB1, SSL1, and two other as yet uncharacterized proteins with molecular sizes of 38 and 55 kDa (8Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Bardwell L. Bardwell A.J.

Genetic and biochemical studies have indicated a direct role of RAD3 and RAD25 proteins in both transcription and nucleotide excision repair, and multiple rad3 and rad25 mutant alleles that are differentially inactivated for either their repair or transcriptional function have been isolated (1Prakash S.

In this study, we demonstrate that the NER proteins RAD14 and RAD23 are associated with TFIIH as indicated by their co-immunoprecipitation from wild type yeast extracts and that formation of this complex is modulated by RAD23. To examine the role of RAD23 in mediating complex formation, we coupled purified RAD23 to Affi-Gel-15 and used it as affinity matrix for binding in vitro translated TFIIH subunits and RAD14. We found that RAD23 interacts directly with the TFIIH subunits TFB1 and RAD25 and with RAD14. The RAD14 protein functions in damage recognition (10Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5433-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that RAD3 binds UV-damaged DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (11Sung P. Watkins J.F. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8303-8308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our study identifies RAD23 protein as an intermediary that promotes association of TFIIH with RAD14. It is possible that the TFIIH-RAD23-RAD14 complex has a higher affinity for UV damaged DNA than can be achieved by the individual components. Both the RAD3 (5Sung P. Prakash L. Matson S.W. Prakash S.

Nature. 1994; 369: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) subunits of TFIIH possess a DNA helicase activity that may be utilized for effecting an open conformation of the damaged helix for dual incision by the RAD1-RAD10 and RAD2 endonucleases (20Sung P.

In addition, the combined helicase action of RAD3 and RAD25 proteins may be essential for post-incision turnover of the NER complex and the damage containing DNA fragment, as our previous studies have suggested a role of RAD3 helicase in the post-incision step (7Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although RAD23 has no known catalytic function and does not bind DNA, via its role as an assembly factor, it could facilitate the efficient recognition of the DNA lesion and perhaps influence other phases of NER.

DNA analysis of the level of entire genomes and the scale of entire populations is being considered. Such a task requires the advancement of technologies, through the understanding of properties of nucleic acids and the optimization of procedures. Frequently, these technologies exploit the specific base pairing properties of DNA for sequence information and genome localization, with shorter probes finding increased application. Shorter oligonucleotide probes are attractive since complete probe sets are possible to obtain and implement. For example, only 4096 sequences compose the set of all hexamer oligonucleotides, while >1010 make up the complete set of 18-mers. The synthesis of thousands to hundreds of thousands of oligonucleotides is currently possible using commercial DNA synthesizers or the new parallel synthesis approaches (1Pease A.C. Solas D.

The use of shorter probes takes advantage of the fact that shorter sequences are a subset of longer sequences. For instance, a particular 18-mer can be obtained by combination of three hexamers. This strategy is being exploited by using either enzymatic ligation (2Szybalski W. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Kaczorowski T. Szybalski W. Anal.

General rules, which account for hybrid stability based solely on base pair type and solution environment, may not be sufficient since local sequence dependences are no longer averaged out as in longer sequences. Many data sets have been collected to interpret sequence-dependent stability, but disagreement among these sets, due to the different types of molecules studied and conditions employed, warns against extrapolating the data for use on shorter probes (17Doktycz M.J.

There is poor understanding of the limitations on implementation of short probes, and models for interpretation of resultant data are imperfect.For optimal use of short probes, a characterization of the various interactions that contribute to the hybrid stability is necessary. These interactions may include Watson-Crick base pair stability, mismatched base pair stability, nearest-neighbor stacking, and dangling-end stability, all of which may further depend on solution conditions as well as the relative position of these interactions in a short duplex. The positional dependence results from the preference of melting to initiate from the ends of the duplex. This is commonly referred to as end fraying or end effects and can propagate several base pairs into the duplex. Data from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments show a perturbation of up to 3 base pairs from the end of a duplex (24Leijon M. Gräslund A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5339-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For a long DNA duplex (>100 base pairs), this may be inconsequential to the total thermal stability, but for shorter duplexes, a significant fraction of the total number of base pairs may be perturbed. For 18- to 20-base oligonucleotides, frequently used in priming polymerase reactions, 30% of the base pairs may possess different interaction energies and perhaps even reduced sequence specificity. For octadeoxyribonucleotide duplexes, more than half the base pairs are affected.The characterization of the position and sequence-dependent stability of the Watson-Crick base pairs and the nearest-neighbor stacking interactions will be useful for the proper design, implementation, and interpretation of sequencing by hybridization chips. Furthermore, an understanding of the energetics of end base pairs will aid in understanding polymerase priming and probe specificity as well as other applications that utilize short DNA probes. To this end, we have undertaken optical melting experiments involving a set of 256 octadeoxyribonucleotides to evaluate the positional- and sequence-dependent stability of short duplexes in solution. This molecule set is subdivided into two groups referred to as the “end set” and “middle set.” The end set molecules are of the general sequences 5′- XYZTGGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCCA XYZ-3′, where X, Y, and Z may be A, T, G, or C. The end set molecules allow the formation of 64 perfectly matching duplexes with every base pair type in every nearest-neighbor environment occurring in the end and penultimate positions. Similarly, the middle set is composed of the sequences 5′-GC XYZGAC-3′ and 5′-GTC XYZGC-3′ to form 64 perfectly matching duplexes to evaluate the sequence-dependent stability of internal base pairs.MATERIALS AND METHODSSample PreparationOligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX) on a 0.2 μM scale and were desalted. All oligonucleotides were assessed for failure sequences by electrophoresis on denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels followed by staining with Stains-all. The sequences were determined to be >90% pure and were used with no further purification.Samples were prepared for melting by combining aliquots of the appropriate single strands from concentrated stock solutions (∼1 m M) of the oligonucleotides with 1 ml of melting buffer (10 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1.0 M sodium chloride) for a final concentration of 2 μM each strand. The oligonucleotide concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 260 nm assuming an extinction coefficient of 1 × 104M−1 cm−1. Samples were then heated in a boiling water bath and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. They were then transferred to cuvettes, covered with mineral oil, capped, and then cooled to 1°C in the spectrophotometer.Optical Melting ExperimentsMelts were performed using a Varian Cary 1E spectrophotometer fitted with a 12-position thermoelectrically controlled sample holder and motorized sample stage, which allowed the simultaneous analysis of six sample and reference pairs. Temperature ramps were performed from 1 to 70°C at a rate of 0.5°C/min. Data were collected at 0.2°C intervals while monitoring the temperature by a probe inserted into one of the cuvettes. Temperature differences among the 12 cuvettes were within 0.1°C. Denaturation and renaturation experiments were performed consecutively and repeated for a total of four ramps/experiment. A minimum of three samples of a particular duplex was examined.The absorbance versus temperature curves were normalized by fitting base lines to the nearly linear regions before and after the steeply sloped transition region and by taking the product of the difference between the absorbance and the lower base line and the absorbance difference between the base lines at all data points. The resulting normalized curve was smoothed once with a sliding boxcar filter, and the first derivative was taken to identify the melting temperature and peak height.Data AnalysisMelting temperatures and peak heights resulting from the individual ramps of experiments on a particular sample were collected and used to assess the variability within experimental sessions. This variability was further assessed by comparing the variability among the sessions as a function of the different sessions using a nested analysis of variance: Tm (i, j, k) = DNA (i) + session (i, j) + measurement (i, j, k), where Tm is the observed melting temperature (or alternatively, the measured peak height for calculation of Δ G0) of the ith molecule during the kth measurement of the jth session. The variance was determined from the 128 duplex molecules, analyzed over 383 sessions, and included 1084 measurements. This analysis of standard variance yielded conservative estimates of 0.4 and 0.0015 for the standard error of the mean of all Tm and peak height measurements, respectively, for a given molecule.The melting temperatures and peak heights derived from the melting curves were used to calculate free energies using the van't Hoff method as described by Marky and Breslauer (25Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). The standard error associated with the determination of Δ G0is 0.12 kcal/mol.The preliminary analysis of Tm and Δ G0values, using the measurement model stated above, was based on a nested-effects analysis of variance as described (26Snedcor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. 6th Ed. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1967: 285-288Google Scholar). Calculations for this analysis were accomplished using a FORTRAN program written specifically for the data set. Subsequent analyses were performed on average values (per octamer pair) of Tm and Δ G0, rather than individual measurements, and are based on general regression and analysis of variance procedures accomplished through the use of the GLM procedure of the Statistical Analysis System (release 6.07, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMelting DataFig. 1A displays some representative normalized melting curves resulting from duplexes constructed from the end set molecules. These duplexes contain a common 7-base sequence and differ only in the identity of the end base pair. Each of the four curves shows a distinct melting profile and resultant melting temperature. Likewise, Fig. 1 B displays melting curves of duplexes constructed from the middle set molecules that contain a single base change at position 4 from the 5′-end. The melting profiles indicate that base pair type and orientation (e.g. A˙T versus T˙A) both lead to distinct changes in thermostability. The different base pair orientations give rise to different dinucleotide stacking interactions, which may account for the different thermostabilities. For the molecules in Fig. 1B, the spread in melting temperatures is nearly 8°C; the difference between the molecules containing A˙T and T˙A base pairs is over 3°C.The melting temperatures for most of the perfectly matched duplex molecules of the end and middle sets differ with the sequence variations. A tabulation of the unique sequence, numeric identifier, and average melting temperature of each of the perfect duplex molecules formed from the end and middle set sequences is displayed in Table I. The experimental conditions were 10 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1.0 M sodium chloride and a strand concentration of 2 μM. The differences in melting temperatures due to sequence variation are as high as 18.9 and 23.3°C for the end and middle sets, respectively, and as high as 8.2°C for molecules of similar base pair content. These differences are due to changes in only 3 base pairs, which lead to differences in up to three and four nearest-neighbor stacking interactions for the end and middle set duplexes, respectively.Table I:Summary of melting temperatures and free energies for end and middle set duplexesTable I:Summary of melting temperatures and free energies for end and middle set duplexesThe melting temperature values in Table I are the result of a total of over 1000 melting curves collected over a period of several months. Samples of a particular duplex sequence were prepared and melted on different days and in random spectrophotometer cuvette positions to reduce any procedural and instrumental bias as well as changes in buffer preparation and temperature probes. Errors due to slight concentration differences, derived from the assumption of a constant extinction coefficient, as well as minor variabilities in the purity of the different oligonucleotides are also recognized. However, concentration differences of a few percent, for a particular sample, did not lead to any consistent trends in the melting temperature. A nested-effects analysis of variance procedure (26Snedcor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. 6th Ed. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1967: 285-288Google Scholar) was used to assess the error associated with measurements collected on a particular day as well as variability from day to day. The measurement to measurement variability (i.e. within a particular day or experimental session) was observed to fluctuate with time such that the calculation of a standard error for each duplex was less meaningful. This fluctuation was presumably due to instrumental problems related to temperature control or accuracy of measurement. We adopted the relatively conservative approach of using the greatest (over time) estimate of the standard deviation associated with individual measurements. Using this, the (again, conservative) estimate of standard error for mean Tm was ∼0.4°C for each duplex. This value was consistent enough for each sequence analyzed that weighted regression was not used in subsequent analyses.An example of the error associated with the data set and the necessity for careful statistical analysis can be seen upon the respective comparison of the melting temperatures of the end molecule set sequences 45, 46, 47, and 48 with the middle set molecule sequences 7, 23, 39, and 55. These sequences are common to the two sets, with the samples derived from separate syntheses and experimental data from separate experiments. The differences in experimental melting temperatures are 0.7, 1.4, 1.7, and 0.3°C for the respective comparisons with a root mean square error (RMSE) 1The abbreviation used is:RMSEroot mean square error. of 0.9°C. This exemplifies the variability in precision within the data set and serves as a still more conservative estimate of the error potentially contained in the assignment of the melting temperatures.Also shown in Table I is the calculated change in free energy at 25°C based on the all-or-none model as described by Marky and Breslauer (25Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). The values are shown for comparison purposes, but it is recognized that they are prone to the shortcomings of the two-state model as well as the calculational methods from which they are derived. The calculational method involves the fitting of base lines for curve normalization, which strongly influences the assessment of cooperativity and apparent transition energy. The transition midpoint is less affected and does reflect more directly the relative differences among the various duplex stabilities. The low melting temperature of some of the duplexes prevents establishment of the lower base line. The low melting temperatures, however, do allow ample data collection after the transition, where evidence for melting that deviates from the two-state model was apparent. The high temperature regions of the molecules with lower melting temperatures showed an increased leveling off of the absorbance at temperatures above ∼60°C. This feature is probably associated with the melting out of the single strands and is contrary to a two-state model. Any stability associated with structure of the single-strand species must be considered when assigning thermodynamic parameters to the transition of the duplex to single-strand configuration.Analysis ModelsThermostability of nucleic acid duplexes is frequently modeled by assigning stabilities to singlet or doublet interactions that account for stability due to base pairing or nearest-neighbor stacking. A singlet interaction is defined as a single base pair (i.e. an A˙T or G˙C base pair independent of orientation), while a doublet interaction is defined as 2 adjacent base pairs, with defined base pair orientations, which give rise to the unique nearest-neighbor stacking interactions. Longer range interactions are difficult to assign due to their relatively lower energies and require a large data set for estimating the greater number of variables. The present data set, however, does allow the estimation of an increased number of variables due to the large number of sequences analyzed. The variables, which are of primary interest for this study, are the possible positional dependence of singlet and doublet interactions. Many of these interactions, however, are linearly dependent upon each other and therefore cannot be uniquely assigned (27Goldstein R.F. Benight A.S. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). What can be determined are the types of interactions that are important and the non-unique stability assignments. These assignments can be used to predict thermostabilities or arranged in linearly independent combinations for comparison purposes.Different thermostability models of increasing complexity were assumed and applied by tallying the counts of the individual terms and evaluating the components as described by Doktycz et al. (17Doktycz M.J. Goldstein R.F. Paner T.M. Gallo F.J. Benight A.S. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 849-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The adequacy of each model was then estimated by the goodness of fit to the data set. The simplest models applied to the data in Table I involved the stability of singlet interactions. The initial model (BP1) assumes that stability is dependent solely on the number of the 8 base pairs that are either A˙T or G˙C. This model can be extended (BP2) to accommodate positional dependence of the singlet interactions by assuming that different stabilities can be assigned to an A˙T or G˙C base pair positioned in the extreme 5′- or 3′-position of a strand as compared with an internal position. The third extension of the base pair model (BP3) assumes that base pair stability varies as a function of all positions in the duplex. Here, there would be four assigned stabilities for both A˙T and G˙C base pairs in an 8-base pair duplex due to symmetry (e.g. position 1 at the 5′-end is assumed to be equivalent to position 8 at the 3′-end in an 8-base pair duplex).A brief description of these singlet interaction models is summarized in Table II along with the number of fitting parameters, i.e. the number of degrees of freedom associated with the fitted model in the analysis of variance, the number of uniquely estimable fitting parameters, and the root mean square error resulting from fits of the various models to the combined end and middle set data. Also shown are two sets of significance values (p-values) for F-tests of goodness of fit. The p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed arrangement of data, or an arrangement even more extreme, under the assumption that the given model is correct. Hence, small values indicate lack of fit, while larger ones do not. The first p-value assesses the model fit considering a standard error of 0.4°C for the Tm values, while the second p-value considers the variability associated with the Tm determination for the sequences common to both the end and middle sets. These p-values indicate different levels of error, which reflect the different components of variability mentioned earlier. As judged by the RMSE values, the more complex base pair models show no improvement in fit over the simpler models. The fit for all models, as judged by the p-values, is poor and implies that a model based solely on singlet interactions, even with the inclusion of positional dependence, does not accurately characterize the differences in thermostability. This does not imply that there is no positional-dependent stability that can be associated with the singlet interactions. Rather, the singlet interactions alone are not sufficient for describing the data.Table II:Summary of singlet interaction modelsTable II:Summary of singlet interaction modelsModels that extend beyond the base pair model and that account for sequence dependence by considering the nearest-neighbor stacking interactions were also considered. These nearest-neighbor models include the terms described above for BP1, but also account for the 10 double-stranded base stacking interactions by assuming no positional dependence (NN1), an end versus internal positional dependence (NN2), or complete positional dependence (NN3). The general model used for characterizing these doublet interactions is similar to those described by Doktycz et al. (17Doktycz M.J. Goldstein R.F. Paner T.M. Gallo F.J. Benight A.S. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 849-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and Goldstein and Benight (27Goldstein R.F. Benight A.S. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but different from the nearest-neighbor model described by Breslauer et al. (22Breslauer K.J. Frank R. Blöcker H. Marky L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3746-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) in that the singlet and doublet information is separated rather than combined. The number of interactions and resultant parameters are greatly increased with the nearest-neighbor models. However, the linear dependences between the nearest-neighbor stacking interactions reduce the number of unique interactions that are assessable. The number of interactions and the number of assessable interactions, along with the resultant RMSE values and associated p-values for each of the nearest-neighbor models, are summarized in Table III.Table III:Summary of doublet interaction modelsTable III:Summary of doublet interaction modelsThe additional interactions show clear improvements in fitting the data set. The incorporation of just nearest-neighbor information reduces the RMSE nearly by half compared with the base pair models. The addition of nearest-neighbor terms is more important than the addition of base pair positional information. Furthermore, positional information on the nearest-neighbor terms is also significant in reducing the RMSE. The NN3 model fits the melting data significantly better than the NN2 model, which was found to fit only marginally better than the NN1 model as judged by F-tests, which compare the size of residual for the two models. The smaller improvement on going from the NN1 model to the NN2 model may be due to positional information on the singlet interactions that arise from the linear dependences among the fitting parameters. Each non-end singlet interaction is related to doublet information resulting from base pairs on either side, while the end base pairs are related to only one doublet interaction. This singlet and doublet information, along with the linear dependences between these terms, leads to inherent information regarding the end singlet interactions.Despite the reduced RMSE values of the doublet models over the singlet models, there is statistically significant lack of fit in these models when residuals are compared with the standard errors constructed from variation in the data as indicated by the first set of p-values given in Table III. These p-values may be reflective of poor fits due to information that is not explicit in the models, or they may be due to errors associated with the data. When the errors apparent from the independent Tm assignments of like sequences are considered, the p-values indicate that the nearest-neighbor models should not be rejected due to lack of fit. Further credence to the nearest-neighbor models appears when those molecules with the largest residuals resulting from the fit are excluded, and the data refit show no meaningful improvement in the RMSE. Any real lack of fit that may exist is apparently not due to one or a few molecules that are somehow different from the others.Fitting the models to the data sets separately shows better fits to the end set molecules than to the middle and combined sequence sets. The RMSE for the base pair models fit to the end set data alone is 1.4°C compared with 2.1°C for the middle set data and 1.9°C for the combined set data. Likewise, the RMSE resulting from fits of the NN3 model is 0.5°C for the end set data versus 1.0°C for the middle set data alone and 0.8°C for the combined set data. As note"
https://openalex.org/W2096747438,"Thrombin-catalyzed activation of heterodimeric factor VIII occurs by limited proteolysis, yielding subunits A1 and A2 derived from the heavy chain (HC) and A3-C1-C2 derived from the light chain (LC). The roles of these cleavages in the function of procoagulant activity are poorly understood. To determine whether LC cleavage contributes to the potentiation of factor VIII activity, factor VIII heterodimers were reconstituted from native HC and either thrombin-cleaved LC (A3-C1-C2) or intact LC and purified by Mono S chromatography. The reconstituted factor VIII form containing the A3-C1-C2 subunit had a specific activity (2 units/μg) that was ∼3-fold greater than that of the reconstituted factor VIII form containing native LC (0.6 units/μg). Factor Xa generation assays using the hybrid heterodimer showed an initial rate that was unaffected by the presence of von Willebrand factor and a reduced lag time when compared with the native heterodimer. The A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer was dissociated by chelation, and the purified A1 subunit was reacted with either the A3-C1-C2 subunit or the LC in the presence of Mn2+ to reconstitute the dimer. Factor VIIIa heterotrimers were reconstituted from either A1/A3-C1-C2 or A1/LC plus the A2 subunit. The authentic factor VIIIa heterotrimer (A1/A3-C1-C2/A2) had 3-fold greater activity than the form containing the LC. However, upon reaction with thrombin, the activity of the latter form was increased to that of the factor VIIIa form containing native subunits. The incremental increase in fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein-Phe-Phe-Arg chloromethyl ketone-modified factor IXa was markedly greater in the presence of HC/A3-C1-C2 (Δ r = 0.037) compared with HC/LC (Δ r = 0.011) and approached the value obtained with factor VIIIa (Δ r = 0.051). These results suggest that cleavage of factor VIII LC directly contributes to the potentiation of coagulant activity by modulating the conformation of the factor IXa active site."
https://openalex.org/W1976601198,"In this study, we performed an analysis of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α3 subunit gene promoter region, −238/+47, to identify cis and trans elements that are important for basal activity in PC12 cells. Sequence analyses of the α3 promoter and footprint assays revealed an Sp1 binding site between −79 and −57 (termed the α3 GA motif) and an AP2 binding site between −30 and −7. Using mobility shift analysis, we found that PC12 cell extracts contain proteins that specifically bind to the α3 GA motif and are immunologically related to Sp1. Mutation of the α3 GA motif, which prevented binding of Sp1, resulted in a 75% decrease in promoter activity. Mutation of the AP2 site resulted in only a minor loss of promoter activity, which is consistent with the lack of AP2 binding activity in PC12 extracts. In Drosophila Schneider line 2 (S2) cell cotransfection assays, Sp1 activated the α3 promoter in a GA motif-dependent manner. Furthermore, multimerization of the GA motif upstream of the β-globin TATA box conferred Sp1 responsiveness. Our results indicate that Sp1 can activate transcription through direct interaction with the α3 GA motif and that this motif plays a major role in α3 promoter basal activity in PC12 cells.

In the central nervous system, however, the expression patterns of these genes overlap to some extent but are not entirely concordant (7Boulter J. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Duvoisin R.M. Connolly J.G.

This suggests that within the cluster, gene-specific cis elements also play a role in cell type-specific expression of these genes. We are interested in investigating the mechanisms that coordinately regulate nAchR genes to permit the assembly of different neural restricted subtype heteromers and are focusing on transcriptional regulation of the clustered genes. Because of the clustered organization, the first question we addressed was whether individual promoters are associated with these genes. Analysis of RNA isolated from PC12 cells and sympathetic ganglia indicated that the α3 gene initiates transcription at multiple sites positioned within the β4/α3 intergenic region. Transient transfection analysis in these cells indicated a promoter that maps to the α3 start site region (17Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have investigated the α3 promoter to identify important cis elements and interacting trans factors in PC12 cells. An Sp1 binding site (referred to as a GA motif) positioned near the start site region was found to play a major role for α3 promoter activity in these cells. In contrast, an AP2 binding site positioned within the start site region had only a small effect on reporter activity. The expression of brain-enriched regulatory proteins that interact with Sp1 binding motifs (18Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 19Pecorino L.T. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3139-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that the α3 GA motif plays a role in establishing the precise cell-specific pattern of α3 expression in vivo. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor base pair(s) electrophoretic mobility shift assay. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor base pair(s) electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The α3 promoter 5′ deletion constructs used in this study were prepared with the ExoIII deletion kit from Promega. The resulting 5′ boundaries of these deletion constructs were determined by dideoxy sequence analysis (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52232) Google Scholar). A site-specific Sp1 binding site mutation was introduced by recombinant polymerase chain reaction into α3 reporter, −1607/+47-luc, to generate mutSp1-luc. A mutagenic oligonucleotide carrying base substitutions 5′-GGT CCG ATG CAT ATG CCA CGA CGG GCG AAC GTC C-3′ (residues −78 to −44) was used in a reaction with a downstream primer positioned within the luciferase gene to generate a 385-bp fragment. The second mutagenic oligonucleotide, 5′-TCG TGG CAT ATG CAT CGG ACC ACG GTC TCC-3′ (residues −57 to −87), was used in a separate polymerase chain reaction with an upstream primer to generate an 874-bp fragment. Products of the two reactions were gel-purified, heat-denatured, and then annealed by the overlapping complementary 5′ ends. The 3′ ends were extended, and then products were amplified using upstream and downstream primers. Amplified DNA was cut with Bpu1102I and XhoI and then used in a ligation reaction to replace the Bpu1102I/ XhoI fragment of the −1607/+47-luc vector. Similarly, a site-specific AP2 mutation was introduced into −1607/+47-luc with the following mutagenic oligonucleotides: upper, 5′-CGC CTC CAT GCA TTA CAG CTG CTT GCA GCG CTT G-3′ (residues −30 to +4); lower, 5′-GCA GCT GTA ATG CAT GGA GGC GGG GAG GCC-3′ (residues −8 to −38). The resulting construct is called mutAP2-luc. To introduce the Sp1 and AP2 double mutation (mutSp1/AP2-luc), an AP2 mutation was introduced into the mutSp1-luc construct using the same mutagenic oligonucleotides described above. Underlined residues above indicate base change sites. All constructs carrying polymerase chain reaction-generated mutations were sequenced across the −238/+47 region to ensure introduction of base changes at only the intended positions. To prepare a reporter construct, in which the GA motif within the α3 promoter was replaced with SV40 21-bp repeats, the Sp1 footprint region in −1607/+47-luc was substituted with an SV40 promoter Sp1 footprint region by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis. Specifically, ACG CAG GAG ACC GTG GTC CGA CGC CCC TCC CAC GAC GGG CGA A (residues −92 to −50 of α3 promoter) were substituted with CCG CGG CCC CTA ACT CCG CCC ATC CCG CCC CTA ACT CCG CCC A, which contains two 21-bp repeats (one of which is an 18 out of 21 bp match) of the SV40 promoter. The mutagenic primers were the following: upper, 5′-CTC CGC CCA TCC CGC CCC TAA CTC CGC CCA CGT CCC GCC TCG GC-3′; lower, 5′-GGG GCG GGA TGG GCG GAG TTA GGC CCC GCG GCG ATG CCT CGC C-3′. The upstream and downstream primers were the same as those used to prepare mutSp1-luc. To prepare a promoter construct (4XSp1-TATA-luc) containing multiple copies of the α3 GA motif positioned upstream of the β-globin TATA box, two 53-mer oligonucleotides that contain four copies of the −75 to −65 portion of the Sp1 footprint region within the α3 gene were prepared and annealed: upper, 5′-CCG ACG CCC CTC CCA CGC CCC TCC CAC GCC CCC TCC CAC GCC CTC CCA CGT AC-3′; lower, 5′-GTG GGA GGG GCG TGG GAG GGG CGT GGG AGG GGC GTG GGA GGG GCG TCG GGT AC-3′. The resulting double-stranded oligonucleotide was inserted into a luciferase reporter, 20 bp upstream of the β-globin TATA box. PC12 cells were grown using conditions previously described (17Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Schneider line 2 (S2) cells were grown at 26°C in Shields and Sang M3 insect medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) that was first heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. PC12 cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (17Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S2 cells were transfected with Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). S2 cells were pelleted and washed twice with M3 medium. 1 × 107cells were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of M3 medium. For each transfection, 30 μl of Lipofectin and 25 μg of plasmid DNA were aliquoted separately into tubes containing 1 ml of M3 medium. Lipofectin and DNA in M3 medium were then mixed and immediately added to resuspended S2 cells. After 2-4 h of incubation at room temperature, cells were precipitated and washed twice with M3 medium. Cells were then resuspended in 10 ml of complete M3 medium, plated, and kept at 26°C. After 48 h, cells were precipitated and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell extracts were prepared using luciferase cell lysis reagent (Promega). Luciferase assays, β-galactosidase assays, and protein assays were performed as described previously (17Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Footprinting assays were performed as described previously (17Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 1-6 footprint units of either Sp1 or AP2 protein (Promega). PC12 cell extracts were prepared essentially as described (21Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to near confluence, harvested by centrifugation, and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. All of the following steps were performed at 4°C. The cells were resuspended in four packed cell volumes of 10 m M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 m M EDTA, and 5 m M dithiothreitol. After 20 min, the cells were lysed by homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer with eight strokes using a “B” pestle. Four packed cell volumes of 50 m M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 m M MgCl2, 2 m M dithiothreitol, 25% sucrose, 50% glycerol were added, and the suspension was gently mixed. With continued gentle stirring, 1 packed cell volume of saturated (NH4)2SO4was added dropwise. The lysate was gently stirred for an additional 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman L7-55 rotor for 3 h. Protein was precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of ammonium sulfate (0.3 g/ml) and neutralized with 1 M NaOH (0.1 ml/10 g of solid (NH4)2SO4). The precipitate was resuspended (5% of the volume of the high speed supernatant) in 25 m M HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 m M KCl, 12 m M MgCl2, 0.5 m M EDTA, 2 m M dithiothreitol, 17% glycerol and dialyzed against resuspension buffer for 8-12 h. The dialyzed material was then aliquoted and stored at −80°C until needed. EMSA was performed with 32P-end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides that were incubated with PC12 cell extract or either Sp1 or AP2 protein in EMSA buffer (15 m M HEPES (pH 7.1), 60 m M KCl, 1.2 m M dithiothreitol, 7.2 m M MgCl2, 0.3 m M EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI˙dC)). For oligonucleotide competition analysis, a 150-600-fold molar excess of competitor oligonucleotides was also added to the mixture. After 30 min at 30°C, the mixture was chilled on ice for 5 min before analysis on polyacrylamide gels. For some EMSAs, 1-3 μl of anti-Sp1 or anti-AP2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added to the mixture. The reaction was then incubated at 4°C for 2 h. DNA-protein complexes were fractionated on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 1 × Tris-glycine buffer (50 m M Tris base, 380 m M glycine, and 2 m M EDTA) at 4°C. Free probe and DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XAR-5 film. We showed previously that the activities of α3 promoter constructs −1607/+47-luc and −238/+47-luc did not differ significantly when the constructs were transfected into PC12 cells (17Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase activity of each of these reporters was ∼20% of that obtained from the SV40 promoter. Because the −238/+47 contains the entire α3 multistart site region, these results together suggest that α3 promoter elements important for activity in PC12 cells are positioned within this G + C-rich fragment. To determine the position of these elements we quantitated the reporter activity of a set of deletions spanning the −238/+47 segment of the α3 gene and upstream region. As shown in Fig. 1, deletion to −77 caused only a small decrease in reporter activity. However, a large decrease (80% of −238/+47) in promoter activity was observed in a reporter in which sequences upstream of −36 were absent. Deletion of sequences to +30 resulted in background reporter activity. These results indicate the presence of an important cis element within segment −77/−36. Positioned within segment −77/+30 are sequence motifs that are either perfect or single base mismatches to the consensus binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 (22Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) and AP2 (23Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not any of these consensus sequences were genuine Sp1 or AP2 binding sites, we performed footprint analyses using pure Sp1 and AP2 proteins, respectively (Promega). As shown in Fig. 2, these proteins produced single nonoverlapping footprints near the multistart site region. The strong footprint produced by Sp1 was positioned between −79 and −57, which is adjacent to the 5′ boundary of the start site region. Inspection of the Sp1-protected segment revealed a core sequence, 5′-CCCCTCCC-3′, that is a perfect match to the previously determined Sp1 consensus binding motif (24Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Vol. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar). Moreover, this motif is reminiscent of an inverted GA box, which was previously characterized as an Sp1 binding motif in various promoters such as JC virus early promoter (25Henson J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1046-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-2 promoter (26Boisclair Y.R. Brown A.L. Casola S. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24892-24901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we refer to this Sp1 binding site as an α3 GA motif. AP2 protected a segment, −30/−7, positioned within the transcription start site region (Fig. 2 B). This footprint included a core sequence with a single base mismatch to the AP2 consensus site derived from analysis of the SV40 promoter (23Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The zinc-finger protein, Sp1, has been implicated as an important trans-acting factor for numerous genes (24Courey A.J. Tjian R. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Vol. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that Sp1 is one of several members of a differentially expressed gene family (18Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 27Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4432-4444Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in determining whether PC12 cells express Sp1 or Sp1-like proteins that bind the α3 GA motif. We prepared PC12 cell extracts to perform EMSA with an oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 3 A) containing the entire Sp1 footprinted region (Sp1α3 ). As shown in Fig. 3 B, two major protein complexes (C1 and C2) were formed on Sp1α3 . C1 had the same mobility as the complex formed by recombinant Sp1 protein (Fig. 3 C). These complexes were specific because unlabeled Sp1α3 inhibited complex formation, but an oligonucleotide in which the α3 GA motif was mutated (mutSp1α3 ) did not. The formation of two major complexes, C1 and C2, on an Sp1 binding site is similar to Sp1-containing complexes reported by others (26Boisclair Y.R. Brown A.L. Casola S. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24892-24901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Robidoux S. Gosselin P. Harvey M. Leclerc S. Guérin S.L. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12202-12210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ma L. Weeda G. Jochemsen A.G. Bootma D. Hoeimakers J.H.J. van der Eb A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To determine whether these complexes contained Sp1 and/or Sp1-related proteins, anti-Sp1 antibody was incubated with the extract and probe mixture. Addition of anti-Sp1 antibody reduced the intensity of both C1 and C2 and resulted in the appearance of a larger complex that did not enter the gel, suggesting that Sp1 is present in C1 and C2. (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1- 4). The inability to completely supershift C1 and C2 could result from insufficient anti-Sp1 antibody or the presence of other Sp1-related molecules in addition to Sp1 in the complexes. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we adjusted the amount of extract so that the level of C1 formed would be similar to the level of the complex containing recombinant Sp1. As shown in Fig. 3 C (lanes 5-10), 0.1 μg of the antibody completely supershifted the complex formed by pure Sp1, but only a partial supershift of C1 and C2 was observed with 0.3 μg of the antibody. Therefore, C1 and C2 are likely to contain an additional Sp1-related protein(s). We also noted the presence of additional higher mobility complexes (Fig. 3, B and C, asterisks) that were specifically competed by unlabeled Sp1α3 but were not supershifted (Fig. 3 C, asterisk); therefore, these represent either degradation products of Sp1 that lack the epitope recognized by anti-Sp1 antibody or distinct proteins unrelated to Sp1. The transcription factor AP2 has been shown to be widely expressed in neural crest cell lineages during mouse embryogenesis (32Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Because the PC12 line is derived from cells arising from neural crest and because we identified an AP2 binding motif in the α3 promoter, we next investigated whether PC12 cells express proteins that bind this motif. We radiolabeled an oligonucleotide (AP2α3 probe) corresponding to the AP2 footprint region and incubated it with pure AP2 in the absence or presence of either unlabeled competitor AP2α3 or a mutated AP2α3 (mutAP2α3 ) oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 B, formation of AP2 complexes was almost completely inhibited by incubation with excess unlabeled AP2α3 oligonucleotides but not with an equivalent amount of mutAP2α3 oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides were then used to determine whether we could detect AP2 binding activity in PC12 cell extracts. Unexpectedly, we did not detect AP2 immunoreactive binding activity to the AP2 motif in these extracts. To determine whether the α3 GA motif constitutes an important cis element in the α3 promoter, we prepared mutated α3 reporters in which wild type GA motif sequences were changed to those of mutSp1α3 (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig. 5, this mutated construct (mutSp1-luc) directed luciferase activity that was 25% of that obtained from the wild type construct (−1607/+47-luc). This result, which is consistent with deletion analysis (Fig. 1), demonstrates that the GA motif is critical for α3 basal activity in PC12 cells. We also replaced the Sp1 footprinted region of α3 with two copies of the SV40 early promoter 21-bp repeats, which contain multiple Sp1-binding GC boxes. Transfection of this construct into cells resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in promoter activity (Fig. 5, SV40-Sp1-luc), presumably because more Sp1 can bind to the promoter. Thus, α3 promoter function may be rate-limited by the level of GA motif binding activity in PC12 cells. Given the data presented in Figs. 1 and 4, a mutation within the AP2 binding site would not be expected to substantially alter α3 promoter activity. To test this idea, we mutated the AP2 binding site to generate mutAP2-luc and compared its activity with that of the wild type α3 promoter. As shown in Fig. 5 the activity of mutAP2-luc was 30% less than the activity obtained with −1607/+47-luc. To confirm the results of the individual mutations, we prepared an α3 reporter (mutSp1/AP2-luc) in which both the GA motif and AP2 motif were mutated. The activity of this construct was slightly lower than that of mutSp1-luc. These results, together, provide strong evidence for a major contribution of the GA motif to α3 promoter activity and only a minor, if any, contribution of the AP2 motif (Fig. 5). Because the AP2 site is positioned within the α3 transcription start site region, the small but reproducible decrease in α3 promoter activity observed with mutations in the AP2 motif may have resulted from mutation of a subset of basal elements. We have shown that Sp1 and/or an Sp1-related protein can bind to a GA motif in the α3 promoter. Furthermore, the GA motif was found to be critical for α3 promoter activity, which suggests that Sp1 transactivates the α3 promoter upon binding to this motif. To demonstrate this directly, we performed cotransfection assays in the Drosophila Schneider line, S2, which does not express endogenous Sp1. Different quantities of an expression vector, pPacSp1 (33Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), driving the synthesis of Sp1 RNA were introduced into these cells together with either −1607/+47-luc or mutSp1-luc. As shown in Fig. 6 A, mutation of the α3 GA motif reduced transactivation by Sp1, which shows that Sp1 can modulate the α3 promoter upon binding to this motif. Activation by coexpressed Sp1, however, was not completely abolished by mutation of the GA motif. The residual activation may result from binding of overexpressed Sp1 to low affinity sites within the G + C-rich α3 promoter. To determine whether Sp1 can transactivate a heterologous minimal promoter via the α3 GA motif, we prepared a luciferase reporter in which four copies of the GA motif were positioned upstream of a β-globin TATA box. The resulting construct (4XSp1-TATA-luc) was then cotransfected into S2 cells with various amounts of pPacSp1 effector. The results shown in Fig. 6 B indicate that the activity of 4XSp1-TATA-luc was increased in a dose-dependent manner by coexpression of Sp1. Transactivation was entirely dependent upon the presence of the GA motifs, because no transactivation was observed from a β-globin TATA reporter in which GA motifs were absent. These results demonstrate that the GA motif can mediate transactivation by direct interaction with Sp1 within the context of the α3 promoter and a heterologous promoter. In this and a previous report (17Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we identified cis and trans elements important for nAchR α3 gene promoter activity in PC12 cells. Positioned adjacent to or within the start site region are high affinity binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and AP2, respectively. The Sp1 footprinted region contains an upper strand core sequence, 5′-CCCCTCCC-3′, that is reminiscent of Sp1 binding motifs (termed GA boxes) that are present within the promoters of several other genes (25Henson J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1046-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection analysis of deletions and point mutations downstream of −1607 indicated that the α3 GA motif was the only major α3 cis element we could detect outside the transcription start site region. It is possible, however, that closely positioned positive and negative elements went undetected by our set of deletions. Cotransfections into Schneider S2 cells demonstrated that the α3 GA motif is clearly capable of mediating transactivation by Sp1, because mutation of the GA motif reduced Sp1 transactivation of α3 reporters, and multimerization of the GA motif upstream of the β-globin TATA box resulted in GA motif-dependent and dose-dependent activation by Sp1. Analysis of the AP2 motif indicated that its contribution to α3 promoter activity in PC12 cells is small. Based on the analyses in PC12 cells presented here and previously (17Yang X. McDonough J. Fyodorov D. Morris M. Wang F. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10252-10264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that the β4/α3 intergenic region contains a single α3 TATA-less promoter composed of a multistart site region, a GA motif that mediates transactivation by Sp1 and/or Sp1-related proteins, and an AP2 motif of undefined function (Fig. 7). Further analyses will be required to determine the role of these elements for tissue-specific expression of α3 in vivo and also the position of additional α3 cis elements outside the −1607/+47 region. Mobility shift assays were used to identify proteins in PC12 cells that could bind the α3 GA motif. Using the entire Sp1 footprinted region as probe (Sp1α3 ), we detected the formation of two major complexes, C1 and C2, that were specifically competed by unlabeled Sp1α3 and that were both supershifted with a polyclonal antibody raised against a human Sp1 epitope. The mobility of C1 was indistinguishable from that formed by pure human Sp1 on Sp1α3 , suggesting that C1 contains Sp1. Because Sp1 is known to be post-translationally modified (34Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 63: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), C2 may represent a modified form of proteins present in C1 or a degradation product. Neither C1 nor C2 was completely supershifted by anti-Sp1 antibody. The inefficient recognition of C1 and C2 by anti-Sp1 antibody is not likely to result from species-specific differences in epitopes, because the peptide used to prepare the polyclonal antibody is perfectly conserved between rats and humans. A more likely possibility is that C1 and C2 contain additional Sp1-related proteins that are very similar in size to Sp1. This idea is supported by the discovery of a family of differentially expressed genes encoding Sp1 and the related proteins, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 (18Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 27Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 28Zhu H.

These proteins bind to DNA with similar specificities and affinities. The molecular weights of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 are also very similar, and thus complexes formed by these proteins on DNA are not readily distinguishable by electrophoresis (18Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 27Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 are is considered to be ubiquitously expressed (18Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 35Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), although the level of Sp1 expression varies at least 100-fold in different tissues (35Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of Sp4 is much more limited; Sp4 RNA is abundant in brain but cannot be detected in several other tissues (18Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Promoters for a number of other neural restricted ligand-gated ion channel genes have been characterized, and comparison of these to the α3 promoter reveals notable similarities (36Kirkness E.F. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4420-4428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Motejlek K. Häuselmann R. Leitgeb S. Lüscher B. J. Biol.

Whiting-Theobald N.L. Gardner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). First, at least two transcription initiation sites have been found in the promoter regions of the GABAAR β3 and δ, nAchR α2 and α7, and NMDAR1 genes. For most of these promoters initiation occurs at multiple nonadjacent sites that are positioned within a G + C-rich region several tens of nucleotides in length. Second, consistent with multiple start sites none of these promoters contains sequences that would indicate a TATA box. Third, Sp1 consensus motifs are often found within these promoter regions, although a direct interaction of Sp1 with these motifs has been demonstrated only for nAchR α3 and the GABAAR β3 (36Kirkness E.F. Fraser C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4420-4428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) promoter. These common features are often referred to as those of housekeeping genes, because many ubiquitously expressed genes contain similarly structured promoters. However, as is apparent from the genes listed above, these are also features of neural restricted genes. This suggests that these genes are controlled by constitutive promoters whose activity is modulated by sequence-specific enhancer and/or silencer binding proteins to produce restricted patterns of expression. Indeed, evidence for this type of mechanism has been demonstrated for the neural restricted SCG10 and type II sodium channel genes (42Maue R.A. Kraner S.D. Goodman R.H. Mandel G. Neuron. 1990; 4: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 43Mori N. Stein R. Sigmund O. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1990; 4: 583-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 44Wuenschell C.W. Mori N. Anderson D.J.

Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 46Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These genes contain housekeeping-type minimal promoters that by themselves lack the cis information required for proper cell type-specific activity. To achieve appropriate cell type-specific control, silencer motifs that are positioned upstream of the promoters and that bind factors present in SCG10-negative and type II sodium channel-negative tissues are required. Thus, based on the structural features of the α3 promoter it is expected that additional cis elements, such as silencers, influence α3 promoter activity to restrict its in vivo pattern of transcription. Although appropriate expression of SCG10 and type II sodium channel genes is critically dependent on interaction of distant silencer elements with repressors, the expression of brain-enriched factors that interact with common Sp1 binding motifs (e.g. GA motif) raises the possibility that the minimal promoters of neural restricted genes that contain these motifs contribute to tissue-specific expression. One such example of a brain-enriched factor, noted above, is the Sp1-related factor, Sp4 (18Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Another example is a factor that interacts with the promoter of the tissue plasminogen activator gene. The tissue plasminogen activator gene is abundantly expressed in brain and is controlled by a promoter that is more active in the presence of brain-derived nuclear extracts than in those obtained from liver or kidney. Analysis of tissue-specific elements in the tissue plasminogen activator promoter revealed GC boxes that bind both an Sp1-like factor and a brain-enriched factor (19Pecorino L.T. Darrow A.L. Strickland S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3139-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). If α3 promoter activity can be modulated by the level of Sp1 factors, as is indicated here by substitution of the GA motif with the SV40 promoter 21-bp repeats and cotransfection assays in S2 cells, then increased neuronal expression of brain-enriched factors that bind Sp1 motifs may modulate cell-specific transcription of the α3 gene. Given the apparent diversity of brain-enriched regulatory proteins that interact with Sp1 binding motifs and the low level of Sp1 expression in the brain relative to other tissues (35Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) it will be important to determine the neuronal transcription factors that interact with the α3 GA motif and perhaps play a role in establishing the precise pattern of α3 expression in vivo.

The time course of activation of these transport systems, which consist of both Ca2+extrusion and Ca2+entry pathways, is not well established. To investigate the participation of these processes during the agonist-evoked Ca2+response, isolated pancreatic acinar cells were exposed to maximal concentrations of an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mobilizing agonist (acetylcholine, 10 μM) in different experimental conditions. Following the increase of [Ca2+]i, there was an almost immediate activation of the PM Ca2+extrusion system, and maximal activity was reached within less than 2 s. The rate of Ca2+extrusion was dependent on the level of [Ca2+]i, with a steep activation at values just above the resting [Ca2+]iand reached a plateau value at 700 n M Ca2+. In contrast, the PM Ca2+entry pathway was activated with a much slower time course. There was also a delay of 3-4 s between the maximal effective depletion of the intracellular Ca2+stores and the activation of this entry pathway. By use of digital imaging data, the PM Ca2+transport systems were also analyzed independently in two regions of the cells, the lumenal and the basal poles. With respect to the activation of the Ca2+entry pathways, no significant difference existed between these two regions. In contrast, the PM Ca2+pump displayed a different pattern of activity in these regions. In the basal pole, the pump activity was more sensitive to changes of [Ca2+]iand had a higher maximal activity. Also, in the lumenal pole, the pump became saturated at values of [Ca2+]iaround 700 n M, whereas at the basal pole [Ca2+]ihad a biphasic effect on the pump activity, and higher [Ca2+]iinhibited the pump. It is argued that these differences in sensitivity to the levels of [Ca2+]iand the different relationship between [Ca2+]iand the rate of extrusion at the two functional poles of the pancreatic acinar cells indicate that the plasma membrane Ca2+ATPase might play an important role in the polarization of the Ca2+response.

We have shown recently that this polarization is not due to a difference in the kinetic properties of the Ca2+release process in the two regions of the cell (7Toescu E.C. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H.

An important functional mechanism underlying this polarization is the heterogeneity in the sensitivity of the intracellular Ca2+pools to the actions of the Ca2+releasing agents (6Thorn P. Lawrie A.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12438-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we reported previously that the intracellular Ca2+buffers have also an important role in the regulation of the agonist-evoked Ca2+signals (11Petersen C.C.H. Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12Toescu E.C. Lawrie A.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18654-18658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a more general definition, these Ca2+buffers include not only the cytosolic Ca2+-binding proteins, already implicated in a model of “dynamic decoding” (13Kasai H. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 16: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but also the systems involved in the removal of Ca2+from the cytosol. Among the latter, the PM Ca2+ATPase is an established contender, shown to extrude a substantial amount of Ca2+following the agonist-evoked Ca2+signals (14Tepikin A.V. Voronina S.G. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3569-3572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakiphosphate plasma membrane. The initial release of Ca2+is followed by a second phase of the Ca2+response, sensitive to the manipulation of extracellular Ca2+. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+maximal agonist stimulation still evokes an increase of [Ca2+]i, but only transient, due to the activation of the Ca2+extrusion mechanisms, represented in pancreatic acinar cells mainly by the PM Ca2+ATPase (14Tepikin A.V. Voronina S.G. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3569-3572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Muallem S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, the extrusion of Ca2+is balanced by an entry of Ca2+from the external medium, the two processes resulting in a maintained, steady-state plateau of increased [Ca2+]i. Several lines of evidence, brought together into the model of capacitative Ca2+entry (16Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar, 17Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), point to the fact that the activation of the Ca2+entry pathway is a consequence of the depletion of the intracellular Ca2+pools. Regarding the nature of this Ca2+pathway, several patch clamp studies (18Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar, 19Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified a Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+current (ICRAC). What is still very much a matter of debate is the question of how the depletion of the stores is transduced into the activation of the Ca2+entry channel and numerous hypotheses have been proposed to account for this process. These include models of “mechanical coupling” involving direct interactions between the InsP3-sensitive Ca2+release channel/receptor and the Ca2+entry pathway mediated through an InsP4receptor (20Irvine R.F. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3085-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) or through the cytoskeleton (17Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Other “metabolic coupling” models propose that the activation of the Ca2+entry pathway is the result of either (a) the stimulation of certain metabolic pathways, such as the cytochrome P450 (21Alvarez J. Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or the NO/cGMP (22Xu X. Star R.A. Tortorici G. Muallem S. J. Biol.

The analysis is further complicated by the fact that in some cell types, such as the hepatocytes, agonist stimulation activates several Ca2+entry pathways (26Llopis J. Kass G.E.N. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Kass G.E.N. Webb D.-L. Chow S.C. Llopis J. Berggren P.-O. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). An important parameter which could help in differentiating between these various proposals is that of the temporal relationship between the depletion of the Ca2+pools and the activation of the Ca2+entry pathway. In the present study digital Ca2+imaging technologies were used to investigate the spatial and temporal aspects of the activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+transport systems following the maximal stimulation of the pancreatic acinar cells by an InsP3-mobilizing agonist. The main conclusions of this study are that (a) the temporal activation of the Ca2+extrusion system is very different from that of the Ca2+entry pathway, (b) the activation of the Ca2+entry pathway is significantly delayed in respect to the mobilization of Ca2+from the intracellular pools, and (c) the PM Ca2+pump display different patterns of activity in different regions of the cell, which could be an important mechanism in the polarization of the Ca2+signal. Individual cells and small clusters of acinar cells were obtained from isolated mouse pancreata by enzymatic dispersion in a water bath at 37°C as described previously (4Toescu E.C. Lawrie A.M. Petersen O.H. Gallacher D.V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, the intact glands were injected with a collagenase solution (200 units/ml, Worthington), incubated for 7-15 min, and finally manually agitated to yield the isolated cell preparation. Throughout the preparation procedure and subsequently in some experiments, a buffer solution (“control” solution) containing (m M): NaCl 140, KCl 4.7, CaCl21.1, MgCl21.1, glucose 10, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.2 adjusted with NaOH) with an osmolality of 295 mOsm/liter was used. For some experiments a “0 Ca” solution was used which consisted of a nominally Ca2+-free control solution to which 0.5 m M EGTA was added. To inhibit all the plasma membrane Ca2+transport systems (28Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 444: 325-331Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), 1 m M La3+was added to the control solution (“lanthanum” solution). Cells were loaded with 1 μM fura-2-AM for 30 min at room temperature, washed twice, and used within 3-4 h. During experiments, the cells, placed on a glass coverslip attached to an open perfusion chamber, were continuously perifused from a gravity-fed perifusion system. The images were captured using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope, an intensified charge coupled device camera (Photonic Science Inc.) and recorded on a MagiCal station (Applied Imaging, UK). Other details of the Ca2+imaging were described previously (9Lawrie A.M. Toescu E.C. Gallacher D.V. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The fluorescence signals were captured, at video-frame rate (0.16-s intervals between two true ratio images) with a 20× magnification objective. In each field, comprising several cells, those cells responding to agonist were analyzed by calculating the mean [Ca2+]ivalue within areas defined with a light-sensitive pen on a bright field image showing the morphology of cells. The areas used for these measurements were of a similar size to those used by us previously (4Toescu E.C. Lawrie A.M. Petersen O.H. Gallacher D.V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Lawrie A.M. Toescu E.C. Gallacher D.V. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 698-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Due to biological variability and to the inherently variable geometry of our perifusion method, the lag time between the start of agonist application and the initiation of Ca2+response varied from one experiment to another. To compare agonist-evoked Ca2+signals in different experiments we have chosen to normalize the Ca2+signal to the first time point of the [Ca2+]iincrease (defined as the first point of increase of [Ca2+]iwhich is followed by two consecutive higher values of [Ca2+]i). Fura-2 fluorescence was calibrated using the cells loaded in the normal way and perfused subsequently either with 10 m M EGTA or with 10 m M Ca2+, in the presence of 2 m M ionomycin. The dissociation constant for fura 2 (Kd) used for the calculation of the Ca2+values was 224 n M. Chemicals were purchased from Merck-BDH (UK) and Sigma (UK) except fura-2 which was obtained from Novo-Calbiochem (UK). Fig. 1A depicts schematically the major Ca2+transport processes which participate in establishing the value of [Ca2+]iduring the agonist-evoked, InsP3-mediated Ca2+signaling in nonexcitable cells. Clearly, in such studies which measure the resultant [Ca2+]i, the direct and separate assessment of the participation of each process to the overall [Ca2+]ivalue is not possible. Nevertheless, by using certain experimental conditions and by performing simple algebraic additions as shown in Fig. 1B, the relative participation of the plasma membrane Ca2+transport systems can be ascertained. In the presence of maximal agonist stimulation and for the short duration (10 s) of these experiments, the InsP3-activated Ca2+release channel (Fig. 1 A, process 1) is assumed to be continuously activated. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+(Fig. 1 B, trace C), the participation of the capacitative Ca2+entry pathway (Fig. 1 A, process 2) is eliminated. We have shown recently (28Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 444: 325-331Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that 1 m M La3+effectively seals the cell with respect to extracellular Ca2+, blocking both the entry and the extrusion of Ca2+(Fig. 1 A, processes 2 and 3, respectively) and results in an increased Ca2+signal (28Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 444: 325-331Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the difference between traces obtained in the presence of La3+(trace A) and those obtained in the absence of extracellular Ca2+(trace C) are due only to the activity of the plasma membrane Ca2+ATPase. Similarly, subtraction of traces obtained in the absence of extracellular Ca2+from traces obtained in control conditions (trace B) will provide information about the behavior of the Ca2+entry pathway. Fig. 1 C shows the actual experimental (mean) values, measured across the whole cell and normalized for the first value of increased [Ca2+]ias detailed under “Materials and Methods.” The participation of the plasma membrane Ca2+transport system was assessed for each time point, as the difference between the [Ca2+]imeasured in the presence of extracellular La3+(1 m M) and in the absence of extracellular Ca2+(Fig. 1 B). In agreement with our previous suggestion (28Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 444: 325-331Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it appears that this Ca2+transport system is activated very early during maximal agonist stimulation. Within 0.5 s the difference in [Ca2+]idue to the PM Ca2+ATPase is manifest, and it reaches a maximal level in less than 2 s (Fig. 2 A), by which time it accounts for a difference of 350 n M Ca2+. Throughout the rest of the stimulation the Ca2+pump remains active. An important property of this transport system is illustrated in Fig. 2 B which shows the relationship between the apparent extrusion rate, calculated from data shown in Fig. 2 A as the difference (d) in [Ca2+]ivalues per unit of time (d[Ca2+]i/ dt), and the values of [Ca2+]i. The noteworthy feature of this relationship is its steepness: at values of [Ca2+]iover 200 n M, even small changes in the value of [Ca2+]ievoke big increases in the apparent rate of extrusion. At [Ca2+]ivalues around 600 n M, the apparent rate is maximal (370 n M Ca2+/s). Further increases of [Ca2+]ido not determine any significant additional activation. The activation of the Ca2+entry pathway can be derived from the comparison between control experiments and those performed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+(see Fig. 1 B). It is apparent from Fig. 1 C that the values of [Ca2+]imeasured in the first seconds after the beginning of [Ca2+]iincrease are, in pancreatic acinar cells, little affected by the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and the two curves are almost superimposable. As shown in Fig. 3 A the participation of the Ca2+entry is significantly delayed, requiring more than 6 s for its activation. This time scale is to be contrasted with the time course of Ca2+release from the intracellular Ca2+pools following agonist stimulation (Fig. 3 B). Since La3+inhibits all Ca2+transport across the plasma membrane (28Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 444: 325-331Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Kwan C.-Y. Takemura H. Obie J.F. Thastrup O. Putney J.W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1006-C1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the measured values of [Ca2+]iin its presence reflect only the release from the intracellular Ca2+pools. The trace plotted in Fig. 3 B shows that, by 3 s, the [Ca2+]ireached a steady-state level, maintained afterward. This steady-state level is the result of the maximal efflux of Ca2+from the intracellular stores through the Ca2+release channels balanced by the reuptake into the stores through the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase. As such, it represents a level of maximal “effective” depletion of the pools, which is thus completed by 3 s after the initiation of the Ca2+release and precedes by 3-4 s the activation of the Ca2+entry pathway. The use of Ca2+imaging allows the analysis of changes in [Ca2+]iin different regions of the cell. In many exocrine cells, the Ca2+signal is initially localized to the lumenal pole from where, 0.3-0.5 s later, it spreads toward the basolateral pole. Using a similar methodology, we investigated the pattern of activation and the apparent kinetic properties of the PM Ca2+transport in different regions of the pancreatic acinar cells. Fig. 4A shows the mean increases in [Ca2+]irecorded during the agonist-evoked Ca2+signal in the lumenal pole of pancreatic acinar cells in the presence of La3+or absence of extracellular Ca2+, respectively. As in previous figures the data were normalized to the first increase in [Ca2+]i. From these results, the time course of the activation of the PM Ca2+extrusion system at the lumenal pole was calculated and shown in Fig. 4B. In this figure the extrusion activity is plotted together with the “reference” [Ca2+]itrace (i.e. that recorded in the absence of extracellular Ca2, when the PM Ca2+ATPase is active). The increase of [Ca2+]irapidly activates the extrusion system, and its activity is maximal in less than 2 s, by which time it accounts for a difference of about 200 n M Ca2+. It can also be seen from Fig. 4 B that the lumenal PM Ca2+ATPase maintains the same level of activity despite further increases of [Ca2+]i. Using the same procedure, the activity of the PM Ca2+ATPase in the basal pole of the cells was assessed. These values are plotted in Fig. 4 C together with the corresponding reference [Ca2+]itrace in that region of the cell. To allow a direct comparison of the activation curves between the two regions, the initial time point in this graph is represented by the first increase of [Ca2+]i not in this region, but in the lumenal pole. In the present set of data, as in previously published reports (2Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Toescu E.C. Lawrie A.M. Petersen O.H. Gallacher D.V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 8Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), the increase of [Ca2+]iin the lumenal pole precedes that in the basal pole by 0.3-0.4 s. In striking contrast to the activity of the Ca2+extrusion system in the lumenal pole (Fig. 4 B), in the basal pole of the pancreatic acinar cells the activity of the pump, after being maximally stimulated within 1.5 s, is inhibited despite further increases of [Ca2+]i. A direct comparison of the time course of the activation of the Ca2+extrusion systems in the two regions of the cell is presented in Fig. 5A which illustrates better the important differences between these two activities. The apparent rate of Ca2+extrusion activation in the basal pole of the cell is almost twice as great as that seen in the lumenal pole. This increased rate of activity is associated also with a greater maximal activity. Finally, whereas the apparent activity of the PM Ca2+extrusion system in the lumenal pole remains largely constant, in the basal pole it decreases immediately following its peak of activation. As seen in Fig. 4 B, this decrease of Ca2+extrusion activity is associated with further increases in [Ca2+]i. The relationship between Ca2+extrusion and [Ca2+]ifor the two regions of the cell is presented in Fig. 5 B. Both the lumenal and the basal extrusion systems are activated by an increase of [Ca2+]i, but the activation in the basal pole is much more sensitive to changes in [Ca2+]i. Thus, for increases of 100 n M Ca2+above the resting [Ca2+]ivalue, the extrusion in the lumenal pole will account for a Ca2+difference of only 40 n M Ca2+, whereas in the basal pole the difference is 150 n M Ca2+. In both regions the extrusion systems reach a maximum activity at [Ca2+]iaround 0.7 μM, but the maximum value at the basal pole is higher than that in the lumenal pole. As discussed before, at higher values of [Ca2+]ithe extrusion in the two regions behave differently in respect to [Ca2+]i: whereas in the lumenal region the activity remains constant, in the basal pole further increases of [Ca2+]iare associated with a decrease of extrusion, indicating an inhibitory effect of [Ca2+]i. Next, the activation of the Ca2+entry pathway was analyzed in a similar manner. Fig. 6 A shows the mean [Ca2+]itraces recorded in the lumenal pole in control conditions and in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. From these traces the time course of Ca2+entry activation was calculated and is shown in Fig. 6B (filled squares). Fig. 6 B also shows that, in contrast to the activity of the PM Ca2+extrusion system, there are no significant differences in the activation of the PM Ca2+entry pathway between the lumenal and basal poles of the pancreatic acinar cells. Two main conclusions emerge from the present results. The first one is that, following maximal agonist stimulation, the time course of activation of the two major PM Ca2+transport systems, i.e. the extrusion and the entry pathway, is significantly different, with the Ca2+entry pathway becoming active more than 5 s after the initiation of the Ca2+release from the intracellular Ca2+pools. Second, it is shown that the polarization of the Ca2+signal, reported previously for several cell types (2Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 3Rooney T.A. Sass E. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10792-10796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Toescu E.C.

Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 422: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), is associated with significant differences in the activity of the PM Ca2+extrusion system in two functionally distinct regions of the pancreatic acinar cells, the lumenal and the basal pole. The question of the participation of the plasma membrane Ca2+transport systems during the agonist-evoked Ca2+signal is still debated. The entry of Ca2+into cells along a strong electrochemical gradient is regulated by a variety of mechanisms (30Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). In electrically nonexcitable cells a salient feature of this process is that the depletion of the intracellular Ca2+pools activates a Ca2+entry pathway (16Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). The molecular nature of this Ca2+entry pathway and, more importantly, the mechanisms which activate it are the subject of intensive research. In some cell types, the burst of [Ca2+]iincrease during threshold or maximal stimulation is preceded by a slow pacemaker elevation of [Ca2+]i(31Iino M. Yamazawa T. Miyashita Y. Endo M. Kasai H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5287-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 32Friel D.D. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1109-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Miyazaki S. Yuzaki M. Nakada K. Shirakawa H. Nakanishi S. Nakade S. Mikoshiba K. Science. 1992; 257: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that an important component of this phase is the entry of external Ca2+(34Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This view extends a previous model (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar, 35Goldbetter A. Dupont G. Berridge M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1461-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) in which it is proposed that an influx of external Ca2+is an essential primer for the ensuing [Ca2+]iincrease. This primer Ca2+initially loads the intracellular pools and subsequently sensitize the Ca2+release process eventually determining the sudden release of Ca2+from the endoplasmic reticulum. Implicit in this model is the fact that the pools are initially depleted of Ca2+. The situation in the pancreatic acinar cells appears somewhat different. Stimulation of cells in the presence of lanthanum at a concentration which effectively seals these cells from the extracellular Ca2+(28Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 444: 325-331Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Kwan C.-Y. Takemura H. Obie J.F. Thastrup O. Putney J.W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1006-C1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) evokes an increase of [Ca2+]iwhich is more rapid and of higher amplitude than in the absence of extracellular Ca2+(Fig. 1) (28Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 444: 325-331Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) indicating that the InsP3-sensitive stores are fully Ca2+-loaded. In addition, treatment with thapsigargin evokes, even in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, increases of [Ca2+]i. Finally, as shown in Fig. 3, the activation of Ca2+entry appears a few seconds after the maximal release of Ca2+from the stores. This delayed activation has also been suggested previously, in experiments using short 0Ca2+pulses during the increase of [Ca2+]ifollowing thapsigargin exposure (28Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. Pfluegers Arch. 1994; 444: 325-331Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The delay in Fig. 3 indicates another important feature: the entry is not activated directly as a consequence of pool depletion. The length of this delay (3-5 s) exclude, at least for this cell type, a number activation mechanisms, including a direct receptor-regulated Ca2+channel (37Felder C. Poulter M.O. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or the participation of a plasma membrane, InsP3-activated Ca2+channel (38Kuno M. Gardner P. Nature. 1987; 326: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 39Khan A.A. Steiner J.P. Kelin M.G. Schneider M.F. Snyder S.H. Science. 1992; 249: 1166-1168Google Scholar, 40Fadool D.A. Ache B.W. Neuron. 1992; 9: 907-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and suggests the existence of a metabolic step interposed between store depletion and Ca2+entry activation. The nature of this process is yet unclear. One proposal involves the cytochrome P450 (21Alvarez J. Montero M. Garcia-Sancho J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but more recent evidence seem to argue strongly against it (e.g. see Ref. 41Koch B.D. Faurot G.F. Kopanitsa M.V. Swinney D.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Other possibilities include the (paracrine) mediation by a Ca2+-influx factor (23Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) or the participation of small G-proteins (19Fasolato C. Hoth M. Penner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20737-20740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Bird G.S. Putney J.W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 21486-21488Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In pancreatic acinar cells, the main Ca2+extrusion system is represented by the PM Ca2+ATPase since the participation of the Na+/Ca2+exchanger is minimal (14Tepikin A.V. Voronina S.G. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3569-3572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Muallem S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The present data show that this system, which is extremely powerful (14Tepikin A.V. Voronina S.G. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3569-3572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is rapidly activated following agonist stimulation, in a manner dependent on [Ca2+]i(Fig. 2 B). An important feature of this dependence is its steepness: even small increases of [Ca2+]iabove the resting values induce significant increases in the pump activity. Analysis of the PM Ca2+extrusion in different regions of the cell revealed that the apparent activity of the pump is different. Pancreatic acinar cells, like many other cell types, display a polarization of the Ca2+signal (2Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Toescu E.C. Lawrie A.M. Petersen O.H. Gallacher D.V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This polarization could be explained on the basis of differential sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+stores to the action of the Ca2+releasing agents (6Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 8Kasai H. Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 10van de Putt F.H.M.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Willems P.H.G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12438-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by recent immunolocalization data showing a preferential localization of the InsP3receptor type 3 to the lumenal pole (42Nathanson M.H. Fallon M.B. Padfield P.J. Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4693-4696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism, not exclusive of the first, is the existence of a differential buffering in different regions of the cell. Intracellular addition of mobile, high capacity, low affinity Ca2+buffers induce significant changes in the pattern of Ca2+oscillations (11Petersen C.C.H. Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In situ cytosolic Ca2+buffers have been invoked in a model explaining the characteristics of the interspike period (43Petersen C.C.H. Petersen O.H. Berridge M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22262-22264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have also proposed that the status of intracellular Ca2+buffers play an important role in determining the specific pattern of Ca2+oscillations independent of the nature of the agonist (12Toescu E.C. Lawrie A.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18654-18658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, the PM Ca2+extrusion system can be seen as an effective cytosolic Ca2+buffer. The different activities in the two poles of the pancreatic acinar cells might play an important role in the generation of the polarity of Ca2+signal. Thus, even with a homogenous release of Ca2+across the cytosol, the more rapid activation of the pump and its higher level of activity in the basal pole would explain the delay in the rise of [Ca2+]iat this pole. Recent molecular biology studies showed that the generic PM Ca2+ATPase is in fact a large multigene family (PMCA family) (44Carafoli E. Stauffer T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To date, little is known about the differences in functional properties between different isoforms, but the few data available on this subject point to such a possibility. Different isoforms can show significant differences in their affinity for calmodulin (45Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Gardos G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8952-8956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in the pattern of phosphorylation (46Strehler E.E. Strehler-Page M.-A. Vogel G. Carafoli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6908-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is possible that these isoforms might display a differential distribution within the cell, as it has been shown in hepatocytes (47Kessler F. Bennardini F. Bachs O. Serratosa J. James P. Caride A.J. Gazzotti P. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16012-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the present study shows that the initiation of the agonist-evoked Ca2+signal is associated with complex changes in the plasma membrane Ca2+transport systems. The increase of [Ca2+]ifollowing the release of Ca2+from the intracellular Ca2+stores rapidly (within 1 s) activates the PM Ca2+extrusion system. The reported differences in the sensitivity to the levels of [Ca2+]iand the different relationships between [Ca2+]iand the rate of extrusion at the two functional poles of the pancreatic acinar cells (lumenal and basal) indicate that the plasma membrane Ca2+ATPase might play an important role in the polarization of the Ca2+response. The maximal “effective” depletion of the intracellular Ca2+pools does not trigger immediately the activation of the Ca2+entry pathway, suggesting the existence of a metabolic step interposed between these two processes.

Constitutive expression of B- myb prevents retinoic acid-induced neural differentiation as reflected by morphological features and the expression of (or lack of) biochemical markers associated with the undifferentiated phenotype. Furthermore, the expression of antisense B- myb transcripts does not allow the rescue of viable cells, suggesting an important role for B- myb in the survival of neuroblastoma cells. These results indicate that B- myb plays a functional role in the differentiative potential of neuroblastoma cells, raising the possibility that this gene is one of the nuclear regulators in the cascade of events leading to cellular differentiation. The B- myb gene belongs to a family of transcription factors that also includes A- myb and c- myb. B- myb is expressed in many cell types including human neuroblastoma cells. Here we demonstrate that B- myb expression is down-regulated during retinoic acid-induced neural and glial differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. This modulation is an early event, is maintained at late times of induction, and is in part regulated at the transcriptional level.

Many transcription factors that normally play a physiological role during development or in adult life can become activated oncogenically upon overexpression or mutation. Several such genes have been characterized with respect to structure, function, and mechanism of action (1Latchman D.S. Eukaryotic Transcription Factors. Academic Press Ltd., London1991Google Scholar). The Myb family of transcription factors includes A- myb, B- myb, and c- myb (2Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which are each located on a different chromosome (3Barletta C. Druck T. LaForgia S. Calabretta B. Drabkin H. Patterson D. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3821-3824PubMed Google Scholar, 4Spence M.A. Spurr N.K. Field L.L. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1989; 51: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Each member of the Myb family is characterized by the presence of DNA-binding and transactivation domains. B- myb, located on the long arm of chromosome X (Xq13) (3Barletta C. Druck T. LaForgia S. Calabretta B. Drabkin H. Patterson D. Croce C.M. Huebner K. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3821-3824PubMed Google Scholar), has a DNA-binding domain consisting of three tandemly repeated segments of 51-52 amino acids located near the NH2terminus (5Nakagoshi H. Takemoto Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14161-14167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region is highly homologous to the corresponding domains of A- myb and c- myb (2Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Deletion of the second and third repeats completely abolishes the DNA binding-dependent transactivating ability of B- myb (5Nakagoshi H. Takemoto Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14161-14167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A transcriptional activation domain containing a cluster of acidic amino acids and different from the homologous domain of c- myb (6Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) is located downstream of the DNA-binding domain of B- myb (5Nakagoshi H. Takemoto Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14161-14167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike c- myb, B- myb does not have a negative regulatory domain, and it does not show negative autoregulatory activity; however, like c- myb, it has multiple nuclear localization signals located near the COOH terminus (5Nakagoshi H. Takemoto Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14161-14167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). c- myb is expressed at high levels in hematopoietic cells, where it plays a major role in the regulation of both normal and malignant hemopoiesis in vitro (7Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. Science. 1988; 242: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 8Anfossi G. Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1991; 65: 677-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Several leukemic cell lines express c- myb at high levels that decline during terminal differentiation (10Ramsay R.G. Ikeda K. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, constitutive expression of c- myb blocks Me2SO-induced differentiation of Friend murine erythroleukemia cells (11Clarke M.F. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Westin E. Smith M. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 884-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). c- myb also appears to play an important role in the proliferation of arterial smooth cells in vivo (12Simons M. Edelman E.R. De Keyser J.-L. Langer R. Rosenberg R.D. Nature. 1992; 359: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Detectable amounts of c- myb are also found in many tumors of different embryonic origin such as small cell lung carcinoma (13Griffin C.A. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 272-275PubMed Google Scholar), colon carcinoma (14Alitalo K. Vinguist R. Lin C.C. de La Chapelle A. Schwab M. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1987; 80: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of B- myb expression is more widespread than that of c- myb and is detectable in stomach, lung, colon, and thyroid carcinoma and neuroblastoma cell lines (2Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Overexpression of B- myb reduces the growth factor requirements of Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts (17Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and bypasses, in part, the p53 growth-suppressive effects in human glioblastoma T98G cells (18Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L. Sala A. Travali S. Appella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, antisense B- myb oligonucleotides inhibit the proliferation of human leukemic cell lines (19Arsura M. Introna M. Passerini F. Mantovani A. Golay J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2708-2716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although B- myb expression, like that of c- myb, correlates with proliferation (17Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 20Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,), transcription regulation by B- myb appears to be distinct from that of c- myb (21Nakagoshi H. Kanei-Ishii C. Sawasaki T. Mizuguchi G. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1233-1240PubMed Google Scholar, 22Watson R.J. Robinson C. Lam E.W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, c- myb and B- myb appear to recognize the same DNA sequence, but with different affinities (23Mizuguchi G. Nakagoshi H. Nagase T. Nomura N. Date T. Ueno Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9280-9284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although B- myb appears to be involved in cellular proliferation, recent work of Foos et al. (24Foos G. Grimm S. Klempnauer K.-H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4619-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) demonstrating that chicken B- myb inhibits c- myb transactivation of the MIM-1 gene promoter (25Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that B- myb can act, at least in some instances, as a competitor of c- myb. Despite the wealth of data on B- myb structure and B- myb function as relates to cell proliferation, no evidence exists for its possible involvement in differentiative processes. In this paper, we have investigated the expression and regulation of the B- myb gene during neural and glial differentiative pathways in a neuroblastoma differentiation model. Neuroblastoma is a malignant childhood tumor with a very undifferentiated appearance and is thought to arise from embryonal neural crest tissue that may be arrested at an early stage of differentiation (26Helman L.J. Thiele C.J. Linehan W.M. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Israel M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2336-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The mechanisms contributing to the onset and progression of neuroblastomas are largely unknown, but nonrandom chromosomal changes suggest the involvement of genetic alterations (27Schwab M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 43-50PubMed Google Scholar). The N- myc oncogene is frequently expressed in advanced neuroblastomas and cell lines (28Kohl N.E. Legouy E. De Pinho R.A. Nisen P.D. Smith R.K. Gee C.E. Alt F.W. Nature. 1986; 319: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and undergoes early transcriptional down-regulation when cells are induced to differentiate with retinoic acid (RA) 1The abbreviations used are:RAretinoic acidTESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are:RAretinoic acidTESN-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid.(29Thiele C.J. Reynolds C.P. Israel M. Nature. 1985; 313: 404-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). retinoic acid N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. retinoic acid N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. Like N- myc, c- myb is down-modulated in neuroblastoma upon induction of differentiation (30Thiele C.J. Cohen P.S. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and we recently showed that down-regulation of c- myb expression is associated with inhibition of neuroblastoma and neuroepithelioma cell proliferation (31Raschell G. Negroni A. Skorski T. Pucci S. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Romeo A. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4221-4226PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to determine the role, if any, of B- myb in the growth and differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, we examined the effects of ablating B- myb expression on the survival of neuroblastoma cell lines and the effects of constitutive expression of B- myb on neural differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. The EcoRI- ScaI region (714 base pairs) spanning nucleotides 941-1655 of the human B- myb cDNA (12Simons M. Edelman E.R. De Keyser J.-L. Langer R. Rosenberg R.D. Nature. 1992; 359: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) was cloned into plasmid pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) in the antisense or sense orientation as confirmed by restriction analysis. The full-length cDNA sequence was subcloned in the sense orientation from plasmid pSV-B-myb (17Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) into vector pRc/CMV. The neuroblastoma cell line LAN-5 (32Seeger R.C. Danon Y.L. Rayner S.A. Hoover F. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 983-989PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). The neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH (33Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum. For cell differentiation experiments, cells were seeded at an initial density of 5 × 103cells/cm2and grown for 16 h before the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 5 μM all- trans-retinoic acid (Sigma). Medium with RA was then replaced every 3 days. LAN-5 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described (31Raschell G. Negroni A. Skorski T. Pucci S. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Romeo A. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4221-4226PubMed Google Scholar) or by Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 × 106cells/dish and 18 h later exposed to a mixture of 10 μg of plasmid DNA and Lipofectin reagent for an additional 18 h. Cells were washed and grown in normal medium for 24 h. G418 (Sigma) was then added at a concentration of 400 μg/ml to the medium, and transfectant clones were isolated 3 weeks later. Total RNA was prepared by acid guanidinium/thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar), separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel using standard procedures (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and transferred to nylon membranes (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Filters were hybridized with specific probes using the high stringency protocol suggested by the manufacturer. The EcoRI- ScaI fragment derived from plasmid pSV-B-myb containing the full-length cDNA for human B- myb (17Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the 2.1-kilobase XhoI insert of clone HFβA-1 containing the cDNA for human β-actin (36Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engel J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) were used as molecular probes in Northern blot analyses. Nuclei for run-on transcription were prepared as described (37Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Nature. 1986; 321: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), with at least 2 × 107cells as starting material. Run-on transcription was carried out with 1 × 107nuclei in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (DuPont NEN, Bad Homburg, Germany). Five μg of each linearized plasmid was denatured and blocked on a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) using a slot blot apparatus. Plasmids used in this experiment were as follows: pSV-B-myb (17Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a Bluescript plasmid containing the complete cDNA for human c- myb (subcloned in our laboratory); pNB-19-21 containing a fragment spanning the second exon of the human N- myc gene (kindly obtained from Dr. F. Alt, Columbia University); β-actin plasmid HFβA-1 (36Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engel J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar); and the pVC vector used as negative control. Filters were hybridized for 36 h at 65°C in 10 m M TES, pH 7.4, 0.2% SDS, 10 m M EDTA, 300 m M NaCl, and 5 × 106cpm/ml nuclear RNA from the run-on transcriptions. After hybridization, filters were washed with several changes of 2 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M trisodium citrate) for 2 h at 65°C, incubated at 37°C in 2 × SSC with 10 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) for 30 min, washed again with 2 × SSC for 1 h at 37°C, air-dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Primers used to confirm integration of the sense and antisense B- myb inserts in transfected cells were as follows: CMV-1, 5′-AATGGGAGTTTGTTTTGGCACCAA-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 699-722 of the pRc/CMV vector; SP6-1, 5′-GCACAGTCGAGGCTGATCAGCGAG-3′, complementary to nucleotides 1020-1043 of the pRc/CMV vector; and B-myb-1, 5′-TGGCATTGCTGGTCAGTGCGGTTA-3′, complementary to nucleotides 313-336 of the human B- myb cDNA sequence (2Nomura N. Takahashi M. Matsui M. Ishii S. Date T. Sasamoto S. Ishizaki R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11075-11090Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide T7-1 (5′-AATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGACC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 865-888 in the pRc/CMV vector) was used as a specific probe for hybridizations. Polymerase chain reaction analyses were carried out as described (38Szczylik C. Skorski T. Nicolaides N.C. Manzella L. Malaguarnera L. Venturelli D. Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. Science. 1991; 253: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Amplification products were separated on standard agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes. Filters were prehybridized in 5 × SSC, 1% SDS for 2 h at 47°C. Hybridizations were carried out in 5 × SSC, 1% SDS, 100 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 107cpm of 5′-end-labeled probe (T7-1) for 16 h at 47°C. After washing in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and in the same buffer for 15 min at 50°C, filters were exposed in an x-ray cassette with an intensifier screen for 1-4 h. Plasmid pRc/CMV-B-myb containing the full-length sequence of the human B- myb cDNA was linearized with XbaI restriction endonuclease (Promega). In vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 1 μg of the B- myb mRNA produced in vitro was translated in a rabbit reticulocyte system (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN). Translation products were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed in an x-ray cassette for 2 h. Nuclear extracts from B- myb transfectants, pRc/CMV transfectants, and LAN-5 cells treated for 6 days with RA (5 μM) were prepared as described (39Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The protein content of each extract was determined using the protein assay kit II (Bio-Rad). One strand of the myb-specific oligonucleotide MBS-1 (5′-AGAATGTGTGTCAGTTAGGGTGTAGAG-3′) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase before annealing to the complementary strand. Mobility shift assays were performed with 6 μg of each nuclear extract or 4 μl of programmed reticulocyte lysate in 40 m M KCl, 15 m M HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 m M EDTA, 0.5 m M dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 m M MgCl2, and 0.2 μg/μl poly[d(I-C)] (Boehringer Mannheim) in the presence of 0.01 pmol of double-stranded 32P-labeled MBS-1 at room temperature for 20 min. Where appropriate, a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled double-stranded MBS-1 or YY1 (5′-CCGAGCCCGCTTCAAAATGGAGACCCTC-3′) oligomer was added to the mixtures as a specific or nonspecific competitor, respectively. Reactions were loaded on a native polyacrylamide gel (5%) run on 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA (1 × Tris borate/EDTA = 0.090 M Tris borate, 0.002 M EDTA) for 4 h at 140 V at 4°C. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. LAN-5, B- myb transfectants, and pRc/CMV transfectants were metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) for 3 h. Extracts were prepared from 1 × 106labeled cells in 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 m M NaCl, 5 m M EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin on ice. Immunoprecipitations were carried out essentially as described (40Wenzel A. Cziepluch C. Hamann U. Schurmann J. Schwab M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3703-3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) using a specific anti-B-Myb polyclonal antibody (gift of Dr. Robert E. Lewis, University of Nebraska, Omaha, NB) raised in rabbits by immunization with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 553-611 of the human B-Myb protein. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 103cells/cm2in Labtek chamber slides (NUNC, Naperville, IL) and grown under normal conditions or treated with RA for the appropriate time. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (137 m M NaCl, 2.7 m M KCl, 4.3 m M Na2HPO4˙7H2O, 1.4 m M KH2PO4), cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (25:75) for 20 min at −20°C and incubated with the appropriately diluted primary monoclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluoresceinated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:40. The monoclonal antibodies and relative dilutions used were as follows: anti-vimentin (Sigma), 1:40; anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (Sigma), 1:400; anti-laminin (Sigma), 1:2000; anti-neurofilament (160 kDa; Sigma), 1:40; anti-collagen type IV (Sigma), 1:500; and anti-S-100 (Boehringer Mannheim), 1:500. B- myb mRNA levels in several neuroblastoma cell lines were determined by Northern blot analysis. Transcripts were detected in all cases (Fig. 1, A and C; data not shown). Since neuroblastoma cells can differentiate toward a neural, Schwann, or melanocytic phenotype depending on the cell line and the inducer (41Tsokos M. Scarpa S. Ross R.A. Triche T.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 128: 484-496PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether B- myb mRNA levels might be modulated by differentiative processes. LAN-5 and SK-N-SH cells were treated with RA, which induces predominant neural (42Negroni A. Scarpa S. Romeo A. Ferrari S. Modesti A. Raschell G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 511-518PubMed Google Scholar) and Schwann-like (41Tsokos M. Scarpa S. Ross R.A. Triche T.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 128: 484-496PubMed Google Scholar) phenotypes, respectively. Total RNA was extracted at different times after treatment, separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon filter. Filters were hybridized with a B- myb-specific probe, washed, and rehybridized with a probe for β-actin to control the integrity and the amount of each RNA loaded on the gel. After densitometric reading of the autoradiograms and normalization for β-actin mRNA levels, the amount of B- myb mRNA, in arbitrary units, was plotted against the time of RA induction. After RA treatment, B- myb mRNA levels decreased sharply in LAN-5 cells (Fig. 1, A and B), and a moderate, but reproducible decrease was detected in SK-N-SH cells (C and D); B- myb down-regulation occurred as early as 6 h after the beginning of the RA treatment and was maintained at later times in both cell lines (Fig. 1, A-D). To determine whether the down-regulation of B- myb mRNA during RA treatment was due to a transcriptional mechanism, nuclei from untreated and RA-treated (for 6 days) LAN-5 cells were isolated, and in vitro transcription in the presence of [32P]UTP was carried out. The signal intensity for B- myb in filters hybridized with the labeled RNA from untreated LAN-5 cells was >3-fold greater than that detected in filters hybridized with RNA from RA-treated cells (data not shown), demonstrating that the rate of B- myb transcription decreases during RA-induced differentiation. As expected from previous studies (29Thiele C.J. Reynolds C.P. Israel M. Nature. 1985; 313: 404-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 30Thiele C.J. Cohen P.S. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), transcription of N- myc and c- myb was also down-regulated (data not shown). A B- myb fragment (714 base pairs) spanning a region of minimum homology to the other members of the Myb family was cloned in the polylinker region of the pRc/CMV plasmid in the sense or antisense orientation under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Parallel transfections using sense and antisense B- myb plasmids were carried out in LAN-5 cells. After 21 days of selection in the presence of the antibiotic G418, plates were fixed and stained, and the number of resistant clones was counted. In four independent experiments (Table I), the number of resistant clones obtained in the antisense B- myb transfections was significantly lower than that obtained with the sense B- myb transfections, with an average reduction of 79% in the four experiments. Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction analyses of the genomic DNA of the residual antisense B- myb transfectants after antibiotic selection demonstrated rearrangements in the antisense B- myb insert that prevented expression of the antisense B- myb transcript (data not shown), suggesting a counterselection of cells expressing antisense B- myb RNA. The marked reduction in the colony-forming ability of antisense B- myb-transfected cells is in good agreement with the results of similar experiments demonstrating that antisense B- myb RNA or DNA inhibits the proliferation of mouse fibroblasts (17Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and human hematopoietic cell lines (19Arsura M. Introna M. Passerini F. Mantovani A. Golay J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2708-2716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our findings indicate that B- myb is required for the survival of neuroblastoma cells.Table I:Clonogenic assay using an antisense B-myb vector in LAN-5 cells A full-length B- myb cDNA was cloned in the polylinker region of vector pRc/CMV downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The molecular weight of the protein product from the cloned cDNA was verified by in vitro translation (Fig. 2 A). B- myb-transfected LAN-5 cells were grown for 21 days in antibiotic selection medium, and a pool of 60-70 resistant clones was expanded. Pooled transfectants were used in order to maintain the heterogeneity of the parental cell line. Integration of the B- myb construct was monitored by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analyses (data not shown). Overexpression of the B- myb transcript in the transfectant clones was analyzed by Northern blot analysis before and after RA treatment for 6 days (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). In comparison with transfectants obtained with the pRc/CMV vector (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4) and with the LAN-5 parental cells (lanes 5 and 6), B- myb mRNA levels were readily down-regulated in control cells, whereas B- myb transfectants expressed B- myb mRNA at high levels, which were even increased after RA induction. Mobility shift assays performed on nuclear extracts from B- myb and pRc/CMV transfectants before and after 6-day RA treatment (5 μM) revealed a specific band in B- myb transfectants (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and 2), but not in RA-treated pRc/CMV transfectants (lanes 4 and 5). The B- myb-specific band had a shift pattern similar to that obtained with a B- myb-programmed reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 2 C, lane 7). This result suggests that the protein product of the transfected B- myb construct retains the DNA binding activity, which is still detectable after 6 days of RA induction when endogenous B- myb is down-regulated. Finally, B-Myb protein was immunoprecipitated in B- myb transfectants and controls using a specific rabbit polyclonal antibody to the human B-Myb protein (data not shown). Consistent with the RNA levels, B-Myb protein in B- myb transfectants was more abundant after RA treatment (data not shown). Rates of growth under normal serum conditions were comparable in B- myb transfectants, pRc/CMV controls, and LAN-5 parental cells (data not shown), suggesting that B- myb overexpression does not confer a proliferative advantage to neuroblastoma cells. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that LAN-5 cells express the endogenous B- myb mRNA at high levels. Morphological analysis of B- myb transfectants and controls induced to differentiate by 6-day treatment with RA revealed the expected differentiation of LAN-5 cells toward a prevalently neural phenotype, with most cells showing long neuritic processes and few cells with a flat morphology (Fig. 3 F). The pRc/CMV transfectants behaved similarly (Fig. 3 E). By contrast, most of the B- myb transfectants showed cell body enlargement with a flat morphology without neuritic processes (Fig. 3 D). To determine whether the morphology of the RA-treated B- myb transfectants correlated with a different biochemical phenotype, these cells were tested for the presence of biochemical markers of differentiation (Fig. 4). Vimentin and neurofilaments, two components of the cytoskeleton that are typical markers of differentiation in neuroblastoma cells (43Shea T.B. Sihag R.K. Nixon R.A. Dev. Brain Res. 1988; 43: 97-109Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 44Hino T. Sugimoto T. Matsumura T. Horii Y. Inazawa J. Sawada T. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 44: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), were initially examined. Vimentin was highly expressed in controls and uninduced B- myb transfectants and remained at high levels in RA-treated B- myb transfectants, but was dramatically reduced in RA-treated pRc/CMV transfectants and LAN-5 parental cells (Fig. 4, top panel). Neurofilaments were absent in all uninduced cells under normal growth conditions (data not shown) and were expressed in pRc/CMV controls and LAN-5 cells after RA induction, but not in the B- myb transfectants (Fig. 4, bottom panel). This pattern of intermediate filament expression, together with the morphological data, indicates that RA-treated pRc/CMV transfectants and LAN-5 cells undergo the expected pattern of neural differentiation. By contrast, the high level of vimentin expression and the lack of neurofilaments suggest that neural differentiation is inhibited in RA-treated B- myb transfectants.FIG. 4Top panel, indirect immunofluorescence detection of vimentin. Shown are B- myb transfectants (A and D), pRc/CMV transfectants (B and E), and LAN-5 cells (C and F) under normal growth conditions (A-C) and after 6 days of treatment with RA (D-F).

Modesti A. Triche T.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 129: 74-85PubMed Google Scholar); and glial fibrillary acidic protein, which has been described in human brain tumors (46Delpech B. Delpech A. Vidard M.N. Girard N. Tayot J. Clement J.C. Creissard P. Br. J. Cancer. 1978; 37: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Finally, the S-100 protein, which is expressed in ∼50% of glial tumors, was also tested (47Weiss S.W. Langloss J.M. Enzinger F.M. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 299-308PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the markers analyzed did not change after RA induction in B- myb transfectants and in controls (Table II). The only exception was collagen type IV, a marker of Schwann differentiation, which was increased in SK-N-SH cells (Table II). This marker was moderately increased in B- myb transfectants after RA treatment, but not in pRc/CMV transfectants or in LAN-5 cells. Overall, the phenotypic data indicate the maintenance of many undifferentiated features in B- myb transfectants treated with RA, although they do not rule out the onset of a different, yet not completely defined, differentiative pathway.Table II:Differentiation markers detected by immunofluorescence in B-myb transfectants and controls The induction of differentiation and the commitment to enter a particular pathway are associated with well defined changes in the regulation of gene expression (10Ramsay R.G. Ikeda K. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6849-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). c- myb, the most extensively studied member of the Myb family, is transcriptionally down-regulated during differentiation of hematopoietic (48Gonda T.J. Metcalf D. Nature. 1984; 310: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and neuroblastoma (30Thiele C.J. Cohen P.S. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) cells. The functional significance of this modulation is suggested by the reported inhibition of Me2SO-induced differentiation in mouse erythroleukemia cells constitutively expressing c- myb (11Clarke M.F. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Westin E. Smith M. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 884-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In neuroblastoma, c- myb down-regulation is an early event (30Thiele C.J. Cohen P.S. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1677-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that c- myb down-regulation inhibits the proliferation of neuroblastoma and neuroepithelioma cells (31Raschell G. Negroni A. Skorski T. Pucci S. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Romeo A. Calabretta B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4221-4226PubMed Google Scholar). We now find that B- myb is expressed in several neuroblastoma cell lines and that B- myb mRNA is down-regulated long before any detectable morphological change when these cells are induced to differentiate along neural and Schwann pathways. Such down-regulation appears to be regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. These findings might be explained in at least three ways. (i) B- myb is involved in the control of proliferative mechanisms that must be down-regulated before differentiation can occur; (ii) B- myb regulates the expression of genes that inhibit differentiation; or (iii) B- myb modulation is a passive event affecting a bystander gene. The last possibility seems unlikely in light of the finding that transfections carried out using an expression vector in which a region of the B- myb gene was cloned in the antisense orientation resulted in a substantially lower number of transfected clones as compared with control transfections (Table I). These data are in agreement with previous studies indicating that B- myb down-regulation inhibits the proliferation of fibroblasts (17Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and hematopoietic (19Arsura M. Introna M. Passerini F. Mantovani A. Golay J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2708-2716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cells. Thus, it appears that B- myb expression is important for the survival of neuroblastoma cells, although the mechanism by which B- myb affects this process remains unclear. Neuroblastoma cells can differentiate in vivo and in vitro toward neural, Schwann, and melanocytic phenotypes, recapitulating the multipotential of neural crest cells from which neuroblastomas derive (41Tsokos M. Scarpa S. Ross R.A. Triche T.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 128: 484-496PubMed Google Scholar). Although many neuroblastoma cell lines show a certain degree of heterogeneity in terms of neurotransmitter expression (33Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar) and differentiative potential (49Ciccarone V. Spengler B.A. Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Ross R.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar), each cell line has a prevalent behavior in response to differentiation inducers (41Tsokos M. Scarpa S. Ross R.A. Triche T.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 128: 484-496PubMed Google Scholar). LAN-5 cells differentiate to a prevalent neural phenotype by induction with RA. When transfected with a B- myb cDNA, LAN-5 cells overexpressed B- myb. Unlike the parental cell line and control transfectants, B- myb transfectants did not show decreased B- myb expression after treatment with RA. The continuous B- myb expression is due to the expression of the exogenous gene driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter that is not affected by the RA treatment. By contrast, RA appeared to enhance B- myb expression in the B- myb transfectants both at the messenger and protein levels (Fig. 2 B; data not shown). The product of the B- myb construct appears to be functional as nuclear extracts from B- myb transfectants retain the ability to interact with a B- myb-specific binding site even after RA induction (Fig. 2 C). The constitutive expression of B- myb results in the inhibition of neural differentiation as reflected by the enlargement of B- myb transfectant cells, the absence of outgrowing neurites, the maintenance of high level vimentin expression, the lack of neurofilament production, and the moderate increase in collagen type IV expression after 6 days of RA treatment. Such an increase in collagen type IV, which is typical of Schwann-like differentiation, is the only marker of other known differentiative pathways found in RA-treated B- myb transfectants. Thus, it is possible that B- myb-transfected neuroblastoma cells begin a differentiative pathway that is distinct from neural differentiation, but resembles a Schwann-like differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found only a slight down-modulation of B- myb in SK-N-SH cells differentiating toward a Schwann-like phenotype. Nevertheless, a decrease in B- myb expression under a certain threshold might be required for complete schwannian differentiation. Recently, the mechanism of action of RA on the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells has been analyzed in detail (50Kaplan D.R. Matsumoto K. Lucarelli E. Thiele C.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 321-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). RA reportedly induces expression of the trkB receptor, which, in turn, renders neuroblastoma cells sensitive to the differentiative action of brain-derived nerve growth factor (50Kaplan D.R. Matsumoto K. Lucarelli E. Thiele C.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 321-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, the nuclear effectors in the signal transduction cascade promoted by the activation of the trkB receptor remain unknown. Based on the results described here, it is tempting to suggest that B- myb is one of the nuclear targets of the differentiation-promoting signal transduced by the trkB receptor. A complete understanding of the process by which a differentiative signal is transmitted to the nucleus is particularly important for the development of effective therapies that may take advantage of the differentiative potential of neuroblastoma cells (51Abemayor E. Sidell N. Environ. Health Perspect. 1989; 80: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Robert E. Lewis for the gift of the antibody to B-Myb and Adelma Di Stefano for technical assistance."

Nonetheless, the hypusine-containing protein, eIF-5A, which is ubiquitous and highly conserved in eukaryotes, appears to be vital for cell proliferation (2Park M.H. Wolff E.C. Folk J.E.

The synthesis of hypusine, and therefore of mature eIF-5A, was correlated with proliferation in several eukaryotic cell types (7Cooper H.L. Park M.H. Folk J.E.

In yeast, the expression of at least one of the two eIF-5A genes and modification of the eIF-5A precursor protein to the hypusine form are essential for cell viability (14Schnier J. Schwelberger H.

In view of the implication of hypusine in cell proliferation, its occurrence in a single protein, and the specificities of the enzymes involved in its biosynthesis, deoxyhypusine synthase was proposed as a target for antiproliferative therapy (2Park M.H.

The enzyme is unique in its modification of a single lysine residue in one protein through a multistep redox reaction (Scheme I). Thus, while being the enzyme responsible for deoxyhypusine synthesis, deoxyhypusine synthase can also be viewed as a pro- R-specific NAD-dependent dehydrogenase. In addition, because of its ability to cleave spermidine between the secondary nitrogen and carbon 5 in either the presence or absence of its eIF-5A precursor substrate (Scheme I), deoxyhypusine synthase may be considered a polyamine-metabolizing enzyme. In early studies with partially purified enzyme (20Park M.H. Wolff E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15264-15269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was not clear whether the reactions leading to deoxyhypusine synthesis were catalyzed by a single enzyme, a series of enzymes, or a multienzyme complex. We now report the purification of deoxyhypusine synthase to homogeneity from rat testis and provide evidence that this single enzyme indeed carries out the overall synthesis of deoxyhypusine.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials ec-eIF-5A(Lys), purified from Escherichia coli lysates after overexpression of the human eIF-5A cDNA as described (23Joe Y.A.

Incubations were at 37°C for 60 min. The radioactivity of [3H]deoxyhypusine was measured after its ion-exchange chromatographic separation from the hydrolyzed protein fraction, as described earlier (21Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J.

One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 pmol of deoxyhypusine/h.The enzyme activity of tissue homogenates was measured after ammonium sulfate fractionation and dialysis of the precipitated proteins (see Tables I and II). This was necessary in order to avoid dilution of radiolabeled spermidine in the assay solution by nonradioactive spermidine present in tissue extracts.

The enzymatically active fractions from several of these batches were combined for further purification. Chromatographic separations were carried at ambient temperature, but the collected fractions were immediately cooled in ice and stored frozen at −20 or −80°C until used in the next step of purification. Other operations were conducted at 4°C.Table I:Deoxyhypusine synthase activity in rat tissuesTable I:Deoxyhypusine synthase activity in rat tissuesThe enzyme activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid procedure (26Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18445) Google Scholar). Approximately 90% of the enzyme activity in tissues was precipitated between 40 and 50% saturation with ammonium sulfate. This fraction was dialyzed versus Buffer A for 4 h before assay. Activity is expressed as units/mg of tissue (original wet weight) and as units/mg of protein in the 40-50% ammonium sulfate fraction. One unit is the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 pmol of deoxyhypusine/h (equivalent to 1.67 × 10−8μmol/min).Table II:Purification of deoxyhypusine synthase from rat testisTable II:Purification of deoxyhypusine synthase from rat testisThe enzymatic assay and purification were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Steps 1-6 show a representative preparation starting from 1121 g of rat testes (two initial batches combined after Step 3). Approximately 50% of the active material after Step 6 was used for Step 7, and the value shown is adjusted accordingly.Step 1: HomogenizationFrozen rat testes were minced and homogenized in a Waring Blendor in ∼60-g portions at a ratio of 1 g (wet weight)/4.2 ml of ice-cold Buffer A (0.05 M Tris acetate, pH 6.7, containing 1 m M dithiothreitol and 0.1 m M EDTA) to which were added the protease inhibitors aprotinin (2 μg/ml) and leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml). The combined homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant solution was used for Step 2.Step 2: Batch Adsorption on DE23The enzyme activity in the homogenate supernatant solution from ∼500 g of rat testes was adsorbed in a batchwise fashion on ∼150-170 g (damp weight) of DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE23) that had been equilibrated with Buffer A. The enzyme activity was eluted with 0.5-1.5 liters of 0.5 M KCl in Buffer A after two stepwise washes with 2 liters of Buffer A and up to 1.3 liters of Buffer A containing 0.1-0.2 M KCl. Portions of ∼100 ml were collected, and those with enzymatic activity were pooled.Step 3: Ammonium Sulfate FractionationTo the combined active fractions from Step 2 was added 230 g/liter ammonium sulfate (to 38% saturation). The precipitate obtained was discarded, and ammonium sulfate at a level of 121 g/liter (to 55% saturation) was added to the supernatant. The precipitated proteins were collected, dissolved in 10-15 ml of Buffer A, and dialyzed against the same buffer before assay.Step 4: Ion-exchange Chromatography on Q-SepharoseThe dialyzed fractions from two to five batches after Step 3 were applied to a 2.5 × 14.4-cm (71 ml) column of Q-Sepharose gel that had been equilibrated with Buffer A. The enzyme activity was eluted with a 600-ml linear gradient of 0.1-0.6 M KCl in Buffer A, and the enzyme in the active fractions was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation by the addition of 351 g/liter ammonium sulfate and dialyzed versus Buffer A.Step 5: Ion Exchange on Mono Q (Large Scale)The partially purified enzyme from Step 4 was applied to a Mono Q HR 10/10 column and eluted at 2 ml/min with a 120-ml linear gradient of 0.2-0.6 M KCl in Buffer A, pH 6.5, after a wash with 20 ml of Buffer A and 20 ml of 0.2 M KCl in Buffer A.Step 6: Ion Exchange on Mono Q (Small Scale)The fractions containing enzyme activity from Step 5 were combined, concentrated, and dialyzed as described above; applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with Buffer A, pH 6.5, 1 m M EDTA; and eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 0.1-0.6 M KCl in Buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. The fractions with the peak of enzyme activity (eluted in 0.25-0.3 M KCl) showed three to five prominent bands upon SDS-PAGE. The enzyme purity was estimated as ∼25% in the peak fractions.Step 7: ChromatofocusingChromatofocusing was carried out on a Mono P HR 5/20 column equilibrated with starting buffer (0.025 M Bistris adjusted to pH 6.3 with iminodiacetic acid). The pH gradient for elution was generated with Polybuffer 74, diluted 10-fold according to the manufacturer's recommendations (35Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Inc.Chromatofocusing with Polybuffer and PBE. Rahms i Lund, Uppsala1982Google Scholar) and adjusted to pH 3.8 with iminodiacetic acid. After injection of the sample and washing with 5 ml of starting buffer, elution was initiated with 100% elution buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance at 280 nm was monitored continuously; the pH was determined on individual fractions. PAGE Small samples of the fractions from each of the chromatographic procedures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (25Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1991: 95-174Google Scholar) to monitor the progress of the purification. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. Amino Acid Analysis and Sequence Determinations Protein (156 μg, ∼25% enzyme protein) from peak fractions after Step 6 was subjected to electrophoresis in the presence of SDS on a precast gel (10% in acrylamide), and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (ProBlott) membrane by electrophoresis at 300 mA and 100 V for 1 h at 6°C in CAPS. The membrane was stained briefly with Coomassie Blue, and the band at ∼42 kDa was excised. The excised portion was extensively destained in 50% MeOH and washed with water. Portions of this washed membrane were used for (a) amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis (kindly carried out by Lyuben Marekov, NIAMS, National Institutes of Health), (b) sequence analysis of the intact protein (carried out at the University of California Protein Structure Laboratory, Davis, CA), and (c) preparation and sequence analysis of tryptic peptides (carried out at the Macromolecular Structure Facility, Department of Biochemistry, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI). Antibody Production Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to deoxyhypusine synthase were generated from the 42-kDa protein isolated by SDS-PAGE of enzyme from a peak fraction (∼25% pure) after Step 6. The prominent stained band at 42 kDa was excised; the gel strip was washed in two changes of 50% methanol, one change of 10% methanol, and equilibrated with water. Protein electroeluted from the minced gel was used for immunization (Assay Research, Inc., College Park, MD). The antibody produced was titered against the enzyme by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, dot blotting, and Western blotting techniques.RESULTSPurification of Deoxyhypusine SynthaseThe choice of rat testis as the source for purification of deoxyhypusine synthase was based on a survey of the enzyme activity in several rat tissues (Table I). Of those tissues examined, the testis was found to contain the greatest activity per milligram of tissue as well as the highest specific activity of deoxyhypusine synthase. It is interesting that the testis, an actively proliferating tissue, is also the richest in hypusine content (27Beninati S. Piacentini M. Cocuzzi E.T. Autuori F. Folk J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and in deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (28Abbruzzese A. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3085-3089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Previously, we reported the partial purification (∼760-fold, to ∼1% purity) of deoxyhypusine synthase from rat testis by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration (21Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the protocol was modified to include a rapid ion-exchange chromatographic step (on DE23) prior to the ammonium sulfate fractionation in order to process a larger scale preparation. Since size-exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-200 gave only a small enrichment (21Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this step was omitted. Instead, exploiting the strong affinity of the enzyme protein for cation-exchange resins, we resorted to successive ion-exchange chromatographic steps (Table II, Steps 4-6). At Step 6, the synthase activity was eluted from a Mono Q HR 5/5 column in a single, slightly asymmetric peak. In one preparation, the two peak fractions showed specific activities of ∼200,000 units/mg of protein, respectively, representing ∼20,000-fold enrichment and 25% purity. Isoelectric focusing of this enzyme from Step 6 showed separation of the enzyme from contaminating proteins (see below) and suggested a means of further purification based on pI differences.Chromatofocusing, in which a gradient of decreasing pH is used to separate proteins by virtue of their different pI values (29Bergström J. Söderberg L. Wahlström L. Müller R.-M. Domicelj A. Hagström G. Stalberg R. Källman I. Hansson K.-A. Peeters H. Proceedings of the Thirtieth Colloquium 1982, Protides of the Biological Fluids. Pergamon Press, Oxford1982: 641-646Google Scholar), was utilized for the final step of purification. A pH gradient range of 6 to 4 was chosen on the basis of the estimated pI of the enzyme (see below). As shown in Fig. 1 A, a single sharp peak of enzyme activity eluted at pH 4.5, coinciding with a peak of absorbance at 280 nm. Upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B), the active fraction(s) were found to contain one major protein of ∼42 kDa. Proteins that eluted at other points in the pH gradient were found to be devoid of enzyme activity. In this chromatogram and in the preceding step, it was apparent that the intensity of staining of the 42-kDa band corresponded closely to the level of enzyme activity. Furthermore, the two peak fractions from chromatofocusing, Fractions 42 and 43, displayed a constant specific activity of ∼800,000 units/mg of protein. The yield at this final step was low, probably due in part to the inevitable losses incurred in processing a small amount of protein and possibly to a partial loss of activity due to the low pH at the elution point. Overall, a purification of ≥80,000-fold was achieved with a recovery of ∼4%. From the data of Table II, it can be estimated that the enzyme represents only 0.0012% (w/w) of the total protein of testis. Properties of Deoxyhypusine SynthaseFIG. 1Chromatofocusing of deoxyhypusine synthase from rat testis on Mono P HR 5/20. Approximately 240,000 units of activity from Step 6 (see Table II) was applied in starting buffer (0.025 M Bistris/iminoacetate, pH 6.26). The pH gradient was established as described under “Experimental Procedures” with Polybuffer 74/iminoacetate, pH 3.78, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected for 24 min, then of 0.5 ml for 10.5 min, and then of 1 ml for the final fractions. Total elution time was 60 min.

Further evidence of this association was obtained by isoelectric focusing (Fig. 2). Coomassie Blue staining of an isoelectric focusing gel of the enzyme from Step 6 revealed several proteins (Fig. 2, lane 2), only one of which was found to possess deoxyhypusine synthase activity. This enzymatically active protein of pI 4.7 migrated as a 42-kDa protein upon subsequent SDS-PAGE (data not shown).FIG. 2Isoelectric focusing of deoxyhypusine synthase.

The top of the gel is at the left. Samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer (80 m M lysine, 30% glycerol; Novex) and applied to a precast isoelectric focusing gel, pH 3-7; and the electrofocusing was conducted at 4°C according to the manufacturer's recommendations, using a cathode buffer of 40 m M lysine and an anode buffer of 10 m M phosphoric acid, increasing the voltage in a stepwise fashion (100, 200, and 500 V) for a total time of 2 h, 40 min. Different amounts of deoxyhypusine synthase (peak fraction from Mono Q column, Step 6) were run in parallel lanes. Slices from one lane were extracted with Buffer A containing 0.2 M KCl and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) for enzyme activity assay, while the other set was treated with SDS sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. A blank lane was sliced into 0.5-cm pieces and extracted in 10 m M KCl (1 ml for 6 h at 25°C) for pH determination. Lanes 1 and 2 were fixed in a solution containing 17.3 g of sulfosalicylic acid, 57.3 g of trichloroacetic acid in 500 ml prior to staining with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In an effort to identify this 42-kDa protein as a component of deoxyhypusine synthase, a sample from the peak fraction from the Mono Q column (Step 6) was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and eluates of gel slices were assayed for activity before and after a renaturation procedure (Fig. 3, open and closed bars, respectively) (30Weber K. Kuter D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4504-4509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although no enzymatic activity was seen in eluates from the region of the 42-kDa band before renaturation, a measurable enzymatic activity was observed after renaturation of the protein from urea (Fig. 3, open bars) (30Weber K. Kuter D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4504-4509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, even without the renaturation procedure, a small, but clearly measurable, activity was detected in extracts of gel slices from the region at ∼84 kDa (Fig. 3, closed bars), even though there was no visible protein staining at this position.FIG. 3Determination of the apparent molecular mass of the subunit of deoxyhypusine synthase. A, shown is a schematic diagram of the SDS-PAGE pattern of the migration of proteins of known molecular mass (Novex Mark 12 wide-range standards) and the three major bands of the partially purified enzyme preparation used. B, the enzyme activity measured in eluates of gel slices (before renaturation) is shown as closed bars, and the activity of eluted samples of gel slices from a separate lane after removal of SDS and renaturation from urea (after renaturation) is shown as open bars. The enzyme from Step 6 (25% pure) was mixed with an equal amount of 2 × sample buffer (containing 2% SDS, but no reducing agents) without heating and applied to a 10% precast gel. After electrophoresis in Tris/glycine buffer containing 0.1% SDS, the gel was rinsed with Buffer A; the lane of interest was cut into 2.5-mm slices; and each crushed slice was eluted with 0.2 M KCl in Buffer A (100 μl) for 16 h at 4°C. Portions were taken for assay of enzymatic activity, which represented a further dilution of SDS to <0.02% (closed bars). The extraction and renaturation of proteins from gel slices from a separate lane were according to the procedure of Weber and Kuter (30).

Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Two salient features of the serpin structure are the stress of the native conformation and the mobility of the reactive center loop, both of which are considered to be critical for biological function. Inhibitory serpins have a stressed conformation in which the reactive center loop is open to proteolytic cleavage. The cleavage accompanies an irreversible transition to a very stable relaxed form in which the newly created N-terminal portion of the cleaved loop is completely inserted as a strand of the major β-sheet, the A-sheet (2Loebermann H.

However, studies have indicated that the stress of the native form of α1AT is not limited to the reactive center loop or the A-sheet, but may be propagated throughout the molecule (9Perkins S.J.

Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) was confirmative.The ability of the reactive center loop to adopt various conformations is associated with opening of the A-sheet, in which a partial or complete insertion takes place. Some factors that may regulate A-sheet opening have been identified by structural comparison between the cleaved form of α1AT and a noninhibitory serpin, ovalbumin (5Stein P. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Others have been identified by studies on some genetic variations of α1AT that cause aggregation of the molecule in the liver. It was suggested that the Z (E342K) or Siiyama(S53F) mutation of α1AT enhances loop-sheet polymerization by opening the A-sheet more readily and converting the molecule into a better acceptor for the loop insertion from another molecule (8Carrell R.W. Evans D.L.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 438-446Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the loop insertion into the A-sheet always accompanies an increase in stability, it is likely that the native stress of an inhibitory serpin is associated with A-sheet opening and consequently with loop mobility. However, the structural mechanism of the link between native stress and opening of the A-sheet remains unclear.Previously, we identified single amino acid substitutions in native human α1AT that confer increased thermal and conformational stability, but that maintain inhibitory activity (23Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substitution of Phe-51 with hydrophobic aliphatic residues reduced heat-induced aggregation, and it is likely that the mutation diminished loop-sheet polymerization. If this is the case, the defect of some genetic variants of α1AT that cause loop-sheet polymerization may be suppressed by the thermostable mutation. In the present study, a stable mutation, F51L, was further characterized, and its effect on the Z or Siiyamagenetic variation was examined. Since the Phe-51 mutation is located at the hydrophobic core of the molecule, the present study addresses the question regarding the link between the stability conferred by the hydrophobic core and the A-sheet opening of the α1AT molecule.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant α1 AT Proteins and PlasmidsRecombinant wild-type and F51L mutant α1AT proteins produced in Escherichia coli were purified from inclusion bodies after refolding and ion-exchange chromatography as described previously (23Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of α1AT were determined in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride using a value of A1 cm1% = 4.3 at 280 nm, calculated from the tyrosine and tryptophan content of the α1AT protein (24Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2993) Google Scholar) and based upon Mr= 44,250. The Z-type (E342K) or Siiyama(S53F) mutation or its combination with the F51L substitution was introduced into the α1AT cDNA by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (25Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D.

For in vitro translation, the α1AT expression vector pF(BLG)AT was constructed in which the α1AT cDNA was connected downstream of the T7 promoter and the 5′-untranslated region of the rabbit β-globin gene.ChemicalsUltrapure urea was purchased from Schwarz/Mann. [35S]Methionine was purchased from DuPont NEN. All other chemicals were reagent-grade. The buffer used for folding experiments was 10 m M phosphate, 50 m M NaCl, 1 m M EDTA, and 1 m Mβ-mercaptoethanol (pH 6.5).Urea-induced Equilibrium Unfolding TransitionEquilibrium unfolding as a function of urea was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and CD spectroscopy. The native protein was incubated in 10 m M potassium phosphate, 50 m M NaCl, 1 m M EDTA, 1 m Mβ-mercaptoethanol, and various concentrations of urea (final pH 6.5) at 23°C. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for 8 h. Tryptophan fluorescence was measured for each sample (Shimadzu RF-5000 fluorescence spectrophotometer) with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 360 nm. The CD signal was recorded (Jasco J-600) at 222 nm at 23°C in a cell with a 0.1-cm path length and a 1-nm bandwidth. The protein concentration for the unfolding transition was 10 μg/ml for fluorescence spectroscopy and 50 μg/ml for CD spectroscopy. Experimental data of fluorescence measurement were fitted to a two-state unfolding model as described previously (23Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Kinetics of Folding and Unfoldingα1AT in the native or unfolded state was subjected to structural change in various concentrations of urea, and the time required to reach a new equilibrium was analyzed by monitoring the fluorescence intensity (λex= 280 nm and λem= 360 nm). The final protein concentration was 10 μg/ml. For refolding, the native protein was unfolded in 7 M urea for 5 min, and refolding was initiated by adding the unfolded protein to the designated urea concentrations. The kinetic data were collected after manual mixing with a dead time of 15 s on average. The major kinetic phase was examined, and the data were fitted to a two-state model to obtain the relaxation time: F(t) = F(i) e−t/τi + F∞, where F(t) is the fluorescence at time t, F(i) is the fluorescence of phase i at zero time, τi is the relaxation time for phase i, and F∞ is the fluorescence at infinite time (SigmaPlot, Jandel Scientific). Refolding data within 5 min was used toavoid a possible complication casued by aggregation.Transverse Urea Gradient Gel ElectrophoresisGels were prepared with a gradient of 0-8 M urea perpendicular to the direction of electrophoresis with an opposing gradient of acrylamide from 15 to 11% (26Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1989: 225-250Google Scholar). Four slab gels (100 × 80 mm) were prepared simultaneously in a multigel caster (Hoefer Scientific Instruments) by using a gradient maker and a single-channel peristaltic pump. The electrode buffer was 50 m M Tris acetate, 1 m M EDTA (pH 7.5). The native protein (20 μg in 100 μl), the protein unfolded in 8 M urea (10 min at room temperature), or the in vitro translation product was applied across the top of the gel. The gels were run at a constant current of 6 mA for 3 h at a controlled temperature of 23°C.In Vitro Translation of Cloned GenesIn vitro transcription was performed with the SP6/T7 transcription system (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37°C for 1 h. In vitro translation was performed with a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). A typical translation reaction mixture (final volume of 25 μl) contained 20 μCi of [35S]methionine, 0.5 μg of mRNA, and 17.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate treated with micrococcal nuclease. The labeling reaction was carried out at 30°C for 1 h and was chased with unlabeled methionine (2 m M).Binary Complex FormationThe binary complex of the wild-type and F51L α1AT proteins with the tetradecapeptide of the reactive center loop sequence (Ac-Thr-Glu-Ala-Ala-Gly-Ala-Met-Phe-Leu-Glu-Ala-Ile-Val-Met-OH) was formed by incubating the native protein (0.24 mg/ml) in 10 m M phosphate, 50 m M NaCl, and 1 m M EDTA (pH 6.5) with a 230-fold molar excess of the peptide at 40°C for various period up to 6 h. The degree of complex formation was determined by 13.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of urea. The buffer system was identical to the urea gradient gel electrophoresis system described above.RESULTSEffect of the F51L Mutation on Thermodynamic, Kinetic, and Structural Aspects of the Conformational Transition of α1 ATA previous study on urea-induced reversible unfolding of α1AT showed that the F51C mutation increased conformational stability toward the denaturant in a concentration-independent manner (23Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thermostable substitution at Phe-51 was further characterized using the F51L mutation as a prototype to avoid possible complications involved with the cysteine residue in the F51C mutation. The F51L mutation also increased stability toward urea as demonstrated by the equilibrium unfolding transitions monitored by fluorescence and CD signals (Fig. 1, A and B). Although the transition monitored by the fluorescence signal was fitted well to the two-state unfolding model (Fig. 1 A) to give midpoints of transition at 1.9 ± 0.1 and 2.8 ± 0.1 M urea for the wild-type and mutant proteins, respectively, the transition monitored by the CD signal (Fig. 1 B) indicates that the unfolding of α1AT is multiphasic. The increase in equilibrium stability by the F51L mutation was also observed in the transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis. Fig. 2 shows that two major transitions of α1AT were detected during unfolding and refolding of α1AT in urea. A major effect of the F51L mutation was a shift in the transition point to a higher urea concentration in the initial unfolding step, which was also confirmed in the refolding transition. The midpoints of the transition of the wild-type and F51L mutant proteins were approximately 2 and 3 M urea, respectively. It appears that the mutation specifically influenced the initial stage of unfolding and had no effect on the later unfolding transition at a higher urea concentration.FIG. 2Transverse urea gradient gel electrophoresis of the wild-type (WT) and F51L α1AT proteins. The native protein (Unfolding) or the protein unfolded in 8 M urea (Refolding) was applied across the top of the gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 6 mA of constant current for 3 h at 23°C. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There are two ways of increasing the free energy of stabilization of a protein: by stabilizing the native state or by destabilizing the unfolded state. Kinetic studies of unfolding and refolding monitored by the fluorescence signal revealed that the F51L mutation retarded the unfolding rate substantially, while the refolding rate was not affected by the mutation (Fig. 3). This result indicates that the mutation increased the free energy of stabilization by decreasing the energy level of the native state rather than by increasing the energy level of the partially unfolded conformation.FIG. 3Kinetics of unfolding and refolding of the wild-type (● and ■) and F51L (○ and □) recombinant α1AT proteins. The relaxation time of urea-dependent refolding (■ and □) and unfolding (● and ○) monitored by the fluorescence signal was plotted. α1AT in the native or unfolded state was subjected to structural change in various concentrations of urea, and the time to reach a new equilibrium was analyzed by monitoring the fluorescence intensity (λex= 280 nm and λem= 360 nm). The final protein concentration was 10 μg/ml. For refolding, the native protein was unfolded in 7 M urea for 5 min, and refolding was initiated by the addition of the unfolded protein to urea at the designated concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The transition influenced by the mutation in urea denaturation may correspond to the transition from the native to the open conformation, in which the major sheet, the A-sheet, is able to accept the reactive center loop of another molecule. To test this, the complex formation was examined between the native α1AT protein and the tetradecapeptide that mimics the reactive center loop sequence. Fig. 4 shows that the kinetics of the complex formation with the peptide was retarded by the F51L mutation, indicating that the mutant protein is more resistant to the peptide insertion.FIG. 4Complex formation of the wild-type (WT) and F51L α1AT proteins with a peptide of the reactive center loop sequence. The native α1AT protein was incubated with a 14-mer peptide (Ac-TEAAGAMFLEAIVM-OH) in 10 m M phosphate (pH 6.5), 50 m M NaCl, and 1 m M EDTA (protein concentration of 0.24 mg/ml; protein/peptide ratio of 1:230; total volume of 10 μl) at 40°C for 0-6 h. The reaction samples were analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. The gel electrophoresis condition was as described for Fig. 2, except that the gel contained 13.5% polyacrylamide without any urea.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The F51L Substitution Increases the Folding Efficiency of the Z-type VariantIf the F51L mutation truly enhances closing of the A-sheet, it might compensate for the defect of those genetic mutations that induce A-sheet opening. The effect of the F51L mutation on Z- or Siiyama-type α1AT was examined by monitoring the folding transition on urea gradient gel electrophoresis with in vitro translation products (Fig. 5). Most of the nascent Z or Siiyamapolypeptides were accumulated at the intermediate state. However, on combination with the F51L mutation, part of the population of the Z type, but not the Siiyamatype, could fold into the native state. The gel patterns of the wild-type and F51L α1AT proteins synthesized in vitro were very similar to those of the purified proteins (Fig. 2), indicating that most of these translation products are successfully folded. The results show that the folding defect of Z-type α1AT was partially relieved by the F51L mutation. The defect caused by the Siiyamamutation was not suppressed by the F51L mutation.FIG. 5Effect of the F51L mutation on the defect of Z and Siiyama variants. The translation products of α1AT labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h carrying the indicated mutations were analyzed by urea gradient gel electrophoresis. The protein bands were visualized by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn an effort to understand the relationship between the stress of the inhibitory serpins and the tertiary fold of the molecule, we previously identified a stable but active variant (Phe-51 ⟶ aliphatic hydrophobic residues) of human α1AT, which mapped on the B- sheet in the hydrophobic core of the molecule (23Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of such a mutation supports the notion that the stress of the native serpin is not limited to the A-sheet, but may be distributed over the molecule (9Perkins S.J. Smith K.F. Nealis A.S. Harris P.I. Chapman D. Bauer C.J. Harrison R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1235-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Wei A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Stability Increase in α1 AT by Enhancing the A-sheet Closing from the Hyrophobic CoreWhat is the nature of the transition influenced by the F51L mutation, which was demonstrated in the unfolding transition monitored by fluorescence and CD spectroscopies and urea gradient gel electrophoresis (Figs. 1 and 2)? The equilibrium unfolding of α1AT was multiphasic, involving at least two slow steps, although the fluorescence signal could detect only the initial unfolding that fits to the two-state model. The F51L mutation shifted the first unfolding transition to a higher urea concentration. Various data indicate that this transition reflects unfolding of native α1AT to an open conformation, in which the major sheet (A-sheet) is open to be able to accept the loop insertion. It was shown that loop-sheet polymerization could be induced with wild-type α1AT under mild denaturing conditions (7Carrell R.W. Evans D.L. Stein P.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition, the thermostable mutation that shifted this transition (Figs. 1 and 2) was shown previously to retard the aggregation rate (23Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transition midpoints of the wild-type and mutant α1AT proteins in the urea gradient gel system were approximately 2 and 3 M, respectively, which are close to those obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 1 A). Trp-194, the major contributor of the signal among two tryptophans (27Powell L.M. Pain R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Herve M. Ghelis C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), is likely to be a sensitive probe for the A-sheet opening because it is located at the top of strand 3 of the A-sheet, being hydrogen-bonded with residues in strand 5 of the A-sheet both in the intact cleaved (2Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and model intact (29Engh R.A. Right H.T. Hyber R. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) α1AT proteins. Finally, the nascent polypeptides carrying the Z or Siiyamamutation, which causes loop-sheet polymerization in vivo (21Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 22Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were arrested at this intermediate state (Fig. 5). Although recent structural determination of antithrombin dimer suggested another kind of polymerization with the C-sheet (14Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 15Schreuder H.A. Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Hol W.G.H. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), C-sheet polymerization of α1AT has not been reported. These data indicate that the folding intermediate detected in the present study is likely to be an open state of the A-sheet, slightly less compact than the native form, with tryptophan fluorescence being fully dequenched, but containing ∼70% of the native far-UV CD signal.The effect of the F51L mutation appears to be specific to the native state. Kinetic data in Fig. 3 show clearly that the F51L mutation increased the thermodynamic stability of α1AT by lowering the energy level of the native state, indicating that the native state of the molecule is specifically changed by the F51L mutation. In addition, the native fluorescence intensity of the F51L mutant protein was lower than that of the wild-type protein for the same amount of protein, while the unfolded values for both were similar (Fig. 1 A), indicating that the native state of the F51L mutant protein is more packed near Trp-194. If the native state of the F51L mutant α1AT protein is more stably closed in the A-sheet than that of the wild-type protein, it would be more resistant to the insertion by the peptide of the reactive center loop sequence. The complex formation experiment in Fig. 4 shows that this is indeed the case, suggesting strongly that the change in the A-sheet opening is one of the physical changes caused by the F51L mutation. In the crystal structure of cleaved α1AT (2Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), Phe-51 is located in strand 6 of the B-sheet in the hydrophobic core, interacting not only with conserved hydrophobic residues (Phe-372 and Phe-384) in strands 5 and 4 of the B-sheet, but also with some residues (Ala-336 and Leu-338) in strand 5 of the A-sheet. The mutations at Phe-51 may regulate the opening-closing of the A-sheet through interactions with some of these residues. By decreasing the side chain volume (23Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the stable mutations may provide a more favorable packing in the native form of mutant proteins.Suppression of the Z-type Folding Defect by the F51L SubstitutionThe proposed mechanism for the F51L mutation is exactly opposite of that postulated for the genetic defect of the Z (E342K) or Siiyama(S53F) mutation, which was attributed to the opening of the A-sheet (21Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 22Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major defect of these genetic mutations is the arrest of the final folding of the nascent chains fr"

In this investigation, we have characterized the role of native cysteines in the function of AE1. We have constructed a mutant version of human AE1 (AE1C− ) in which all five cysteines of AE1 were replaced with serines. Wild-type and AE1C− cDNAs were expressed by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney cells. Two of the mutated cysteines in AE1C− are in a region involved in ankyrin binding, and ankyrin binding has previously been shown to be sensitive to the oxidation state of these cysteines. However, the KD values for ankyrin binding by AE1 and AE1C− were indistinguishable, suggesting that AE1 cysteines are not essential components of the ankyrin-binding site. Using size exclusion chromatography, both AE1 and AE1C− were found to associate as a mixture of dimers and high molecular mass complexes. The rate of anion exchange by AE1C− , as measured in a reconstituted microsome sulfate transport assay, was indistinguishable from that by AE1 and was inhibited by 4,4′-diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate. We conclude that the cysteines of AE1 are not required for the anion exchange or cytoskeletal binding roles of the protein.

We conclude that the cysteines of AE1 are not required for the anion exchange or cytoskeletal binding roles of the protein. AE1 is the best studied member of a family of plasma membrane anion exchange proteins that are widely distributed across mammalian tissues. These proteins include AE1 (Band 3) expressed in erythrocytes and kidney; AE2 found in kidney, lymphocytes, and stomach; and AE3 found in brain, heart, and retina (1Kopito R.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1990; 123: 177-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All three anion exchangers function to exchange the physiological substrates Cl− and HCO3− across the plasma membrane. This anion exchange process contributes to the regulation of intracellular pH, [Cl−], and volume and is involved in proton, bicarbonate, and chloride secretion in some epithelial tissues. Anion exchangers are bifunctional proteins that have two clearly separated domains: a highly conserved 55-kDa membrane domain that is sufficient to mediate anion exchange and a more divergent 45-110-kDa cytoplasmic domain (2Reithmeier R.A.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 515-523Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In erythrocytes, the cytoplasmic domain of AE1 is required to anchor the plasma membrane to the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton via interaction with ankyrin (3Bennett V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). AE1 transports a wide range of small anions including Cl−, HCO3−, H2PO4−, and SO42− (4Jennings M.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 397-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Sulfate is frequently used to measure anion exchange activity because it is transported 104times more slowly than Cl−, allowing measurement of sulfate transport on a longer time scale (4Jennings M.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 397-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). An important aspect of AE1 structure is its oligomeric state. Early studies indicated that AE1 could be cross-linked covalently to dimers by oxidation of its cytoplasmic cysteine residues (5Reithmeier R.A.F. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6151-6155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A wide range of techniques including electron microscopy, radiation inactivation, spectroscopy, cross-linking, and hydrodynamics have been used to examine the oligomeric structure of AE1, with the conclusion that AE1 is a mixture of homodimers and homotetramers in the erythrocyte membrane and in detergent solution (6Reithmeier R.A.F. Casey J.R. Prog. Cell Res. 1992; 2: 181-190Crossref Google Scholar). Monomeric AE1 can be observed only after protein denaturation with dimethylmaleic anhydride or SDS (7Nakashima H. Makino S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 933-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the electron diffraction structure of AE1 has 2-fold symmetry (8Wang D.N. Kuhlbrandt W. Sarabia V. Reithmeier R.A.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting, together with the above data, that the oligomeric unit of native AE1 in the membrane is minimally a homodimer. The affinity of ankyrin binding to AE1 is dependent upon AE1 oligomeric structure. The population of AE1 released from erythrocyte membranes by C12E8 1The abbreviations used are:C12E8octaethylene glycol monododecyl etherHEKhuman embryonic kidneyHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidH2DIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate. detergent is purely homodimeric, suggesting that the tetrameric fraction remains bound to the cytoskeleton via ankyrin binding (9Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15726-15737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, using time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy, two populations of AE1 were resolved, one smaller and more mobile and the other larger and immobilized (10Tsuji A. Kawasaki K. Ohnishi S.-I. Merkle H. Kusumi A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7447-7452Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which was interpreted to mean that AE1 tetramers bind to ankyrin. Taken together, it is likely that AE1 tetramers form the high affinity ankyrin-binding site. octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether human embryonic kidney high pressure liquid chromatography 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid 4,4′-diisothiocyanodihydrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate. Human AE1 protein contains five cysteine residues at amino acids 201, 317, 479, 843, and 885. As seen schematically in Fig. 1, two of these cysteines are found in the cytoplasmic domain of AE1, and three are in the membrane domain. We have mutated each of these cysteines to serine to examine their role in the function of AE1. The regions of the cytoplasmic domain that are involved in ankyrin binding have been mapped to amino acids 190-203 and 317-359 because antibodies directed against these sequences block ankyrin binding (11Thevenin B.J.-M. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15886-15892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.-M. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M. Benson M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol.

Chemical modification or oxidative cross-linking of Cys-201 and Cys-317 has been shown to impair ankyrin binding (11Thevenin B.J.-M. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15886-15892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that they either are directly essential for ankyrin binding or are in a region that is essential for ankyrin binding. The ability to cross-link Cys-201 and Cys-317 suggests that they are close to each other in the protein's folded structure (11Thevenin B.J.-M. Willardson B.M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15886-15892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since they can also be cross-linked intermolecularly between subunits of an AE1 dimer (5Reithmeier R.A.F. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6151-6155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Cys-201 and Cys-317 may be oriented along the dimeric interface. Kidney AE1, which lacks the amino-terminal 79 amino acids of AE1, was recently shown not to bind ankyrin (14Ding Y. Casey J.R. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32201-32208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of ankyrin impaired the ability to phosphorylate two tyrosine residues within this amino-terminal region (12Willardson B.M. Thevenin B.J.-M. Harrison M.L. Kuster W.M. Benson M.D. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15893-15899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that the NH2-terminal region is essential for ankyrin binding, although the region containing the two cytoplasmic cysteine residues may also play a role. One cysteine residue of human AE1, Cys-843, has been shown to be post-translationally modified by palmitylation in human erythrocytes (15Okubo K. Hamasaki N. Hara K. Kageura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16420-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that palmitylation could serve to localize a residue to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and thereby stabilize a transmembrane helix. However, palmitylation of the residue corresponding to Cys-843 in mouse AE1 was recently shown not to be required for anion exchange activity when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes (16Kang D. Karbach D. Passow H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1194: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the role of native sulfhydryls in AE1 function and oligomeric structure. Our data demonstrate that the sulfhydryls of AE1 have no role that cannot be replaced by serine. The availability of such a mutant will facilitate future structure-function studies of AE1 that employ chemistry of engineered -SH groups. A human AE1 cDNA (pHB3) (17Lux S.E. John K.M. Kopito R.R.

Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using an AccI- EcoRI linker. The resulting human AE1 expression construct was called pJRC9 and contains 27 bases of 5′-untranslated sequence and the full coding sequence. Expression vector pRBG4 contains the cytotomegalovirus immediate early gene promoter (18Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed using a polymerase chain reaction megaprimer mutagenesis strategy as described (19Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction primers were designed using the Primers program (Whitehead Institute for Medical Research). Polymerase chain reaction was performed using an ERICOMP thermal cycler and Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.). Sequences generated by polymerase chain reaction were sequenced in their entirety to ensure that no polymerase errors were introduced. The human cysteineless AE1 mutant was constructed by cloning the mutant regions of each individual Cys-Ser mutant consecutively into pJRC9. The construct coding for human cysteineless AE1 cDNA in the pRBG4 expression vector was called pJRC26. The cysteineless protein encoded by pJRC26 was called AE1C− . Anion exchangers were expressed by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (21Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 52: 59-72Crossref Scopus (3512) Google Scholar) as described previously (22Ruetz S. Lindsey A.E. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), except that calcium phosphate-precipitated plasmid was added at 12 μg of plasmid/150-mm tissue culture plate. Eight 150-mm dishes of cells were harvested by scraping from the plate, and cells were washed twice with 140 m M NaCl, 10 m M Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. Cells were swollen in 10 ml of lysis buffer (1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 m M Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) for 20 min at 4°C and then lysed by 50 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer on ice. The lysate was diluted to 20 ml with lysis buffer and made to 10% (w/v) sucrose by the addition of 50% (w/v) sucrose. Nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min. The two pellets were pooled, extracted with 25 ml of lysis buffer containing 10% (w/v) sucrose, and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min. This supernatant was pooled with the previous supernatant and made to 25 m M KCl and 10 m M Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4. The membrane extract was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-45 rotor for 50 min. This membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 7% (w/v) sucrose, 25 m M KCl, 1 m M MgCl2, 15 m M Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, by 10 gentle strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Microsomal membranes were used either fresh or frozen as aliquots in liquid nitrogen. Erythrocyte ghost membranes and purified Band 3 protein were isolated as described (23Casey J.R. Lieberman D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 494-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Membranes (1.4 mg of protein) were suspended in 1 m M dithiothreitol, 5 m M sodium phosphate, pH 8, and centrifuged for 30 min at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti-50 rotor. Membranes were solubilized by resuspension in 200 μl of 2% (v/v) C12E8 , 0.1% (v/v) 1 m M dithiothreitol, 5 m M sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. After 20 min of incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 45,000 rpm in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor. Supernatants were subjected to size exclusion HPLC on a 0.75 × 30-cm TSK 4000SW column (Beckman Instruments) eluted with 0.1 M sodium chloride, 0.1% (v/v) C12E8 , 5 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, as described previously (9Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15726-15737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flow rate was 0.5 ml/min using a Beckman 114M pump. The column was calibrated with protein standards (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that were shown not to bind detergent (24LeMaire M. Aggerbeck L.P. Monteilhet C. Andersen J.P.M.J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To assay the elution position of the anion exchange protein, 30-s fractions of column eluate were collected, made to 1% (w/v) SDS, and dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Dot blots were processed as immunoblots as described below and quantified using a Scanjet Plus scanner (Hewlett-Packard Co.) and Image 1.44 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A truncated 43-kDa fragment of ankyrin was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified (25Davis L.H. Otto E. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11163-11169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 125I-labeled as described (26Bennett V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Radioiodinated ankyrin was diluted with unlabeled ankyrin to a specific activity of 2 × 105cpm/μg. Ankyrin binding assays were performed as described (14Ding Y. Casey J.R. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32201-32208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen HEK cell membranes were thawed, and aliquots (30 μg of protein) were added to 125I-labeled ankyrin in 150 μl of binding buffer (1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 90 m M NaCl, 1 m M EDTA, 0.5 m M dithiothreitol, 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20, 10 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The suspension was then loaded onto 0.25 ml of binding buffer containing 20% (w/v) sucrose in a 0.4-ml microtest tube (4 × 43 mm; Eppendorf North America, Inc.) and centrifuged at 16,000 rpm in an SS34 rotor for 20 min. Tubes were then frozen in dry ice. The bottom of the tube was cut off with a razor blade, and the pelleted membranes were subjected to γ-counting in a Beckman γ-5500B counter. The reconstitution method was as described. 2I. Sekler, R. S. Lo, and R. R. Kopito, submitted for publication. In a typical time course, 150 μg (∼20 μl) of membrane protein was added to 500 μl of 2 × reaction buffer (40 m M sodium sulfate, 4 m M MgCl2, 20 m M Mes/KOH, pH 6.0), 40 μCi of [35S]sulfuric acid (DuPont NEN), and 500 μl of sonicated soybean phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) in water (20 mg/ml). To fuse the lipid vesicles with the microsomes (forming larger, less leaky vesicles), the mixture was frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed at room temperature, and sonicated twice for 1 s each time in a G112SP1G bath sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Co., Hickesville, NY). Extravesicular [35S]SO42− was removed on a 10-ml spin column of Sephadex G-50 (fine) equilibrated with 1 × reaction buffer. The eluate from the column was placed into an ice-cold glass tube. H2DIDS-treated samples also contained 160 μM H2DIDS (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in the reconstitution mixture and in 1 × reaction buffer. Transport was initiated by placing the glass tube in a water bath at 25°C. For each time point, samples in triplicate were removed from the tube and pipetted onto an ice-cold 1.5-ml column of Dowex 1 resin equilibrated with 0.1 M sucrose. The columns were rapidly washed with 2 × 0.75 ml of ice-cold 0.1 M sucrose. The radioactivity associated with each eluate was then measured by scintillation counting. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207510) Google Scholar), and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose as described (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were blocked by incubation for 30 min in antibody buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 137 m M NaCl, 20 m M Tris/HCl, pH 7.6). Blots were incubated with anti-AE1 antibody 5-297, an antipeptide antibody raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal 12 amino acids of mouse Band 3 protein (30Thomas H.A. Machen T.E. Smolka A. Baron R. Kopito R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 26: C537-C544Crossref Google Scholar). Conditions were 10 ml/blot 1:2500 diluted antibody in antibody buffer for 2 h at room temperature, followed by 10 ml/blot 1:2500 diluted donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.) incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were visualized using Renaissance chemiluminescent reagent (DuPont NEN) and Hyperfilm (Amersham Corp.). Plasmids for transfections were prepared using QIAGEN columns (QIAGEN Inc.). DNA sequencing of plasmids was performed with Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. All other procedures followed standard protocols (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bicinchoninic acid reagent (Sigma) in the presence of SDS. Amino acid sequences were aligned with Intelligenetics software. Expression of AE1 and AE1C− -Fig. 2 shows an immunoblot of wild-type AE1 and AE1C− . In the experiment shown, equal amounts of transfected HEK cell membrane protein were loaded, yet slightly more AE1 is observed in the lane containing the cysteineless mutant. This higher expression level was not observed consistently, so the mutations in AE1C− do not influence biosynthetic levels. The recombinant proteins have a faster electrophoretic mobility than erythrocyte Band 3 because erythrocyte AE1 is glycosylated with up to 10 kDa of heterogeneous carbohydrate (32Fukuda M. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8260-8273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since AE1 expressed in HEK cells is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, it receives only core carbohydrate (22Ruetz S. Lindsey A.E. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). One measure of AE1 native structure is its oligomeric state. Several lines of evidence suggest that in the native membrane and in detergent solution, the minimal oligomeric unit of AE1 is the homodimer (6Reithmeier R.A.F. Casey J.R. Prog. Cell Res. 1992; 2: 181-190Crossref Google Scholar). Size exclusion HPLC has been shown to resolve Band 3 oligomers and has revealed that the protein is a mixture of dimers and tetramers in C12E8 solution (9Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15726-15737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In size exclusion HPLC experiments, the elution position of protein is monitored, usually spectrophotometrically, and the Stokes radius of the eluted molecule can be determined after appropriate calibration of the column. Since AE1 in HEK cell membranes is expressed at ∼1% of the level of Band 3 in the erythrocyte, isolation of sufficient pure recombinant AE1 to allow spectrophotometric detection of protein elution is not possible. Therefore, to determine the oligomeric state of AE1 protein expressed in HEK cells, we combined size exclusion HPLC with detection of eluted protein by immunoblots. In the experiment shown in Fig. 3, C12E8-solubilized HEK cell membranes were applied to the size exclusion HPLC column. Fractions of the eluate were applied to nitrocellulose by “dot blotting,” and the nitrocellulose was processed as a conventional immunoblot. The amount of AE1 eluting in each fraction was then quantitated relative to standard amounts of AE1. As seen in Fig. 3(upper panel), the elution profile of purified erythrocyte Band 3 protein has four peaks. These peaks were previously identified as highly associated AE1 protein, which elutes at the void volume (5.03 ml); tetrameric AE1 (6.75 ml); dimeric AE1 (7.85 ml); and detergent micelles (10.35 ml) (9Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15726-15737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3(lower panel) shows that both wild-type AE1 and AE1C− from HEK cell membranes elute as two peaks; the first is at the void volume of the column and therefore represents a large protein complex, while the second elutes close to the position of dimeric erythrocyte AE1 protein. Although the peak positions of AE1 and AE1C− do not coincide, the elution position of AE1C− is not consistent with that of the tetramer. In some preparations, wild-type AE1 eluted as a single major peak at a position corresponding to dimeric protein; however, in no preparation of AE1C− was the protein peak at the void volume absent. The oligomeric state of AE1 expressed in HEK cells is predominantly dimeric, but the protein also associates into very large complexes. Oligomeric structure is not grossly altered in AE1C− . Erythrocyte Band 3 protein (AE1) anchors the cytoskeleton to the membrane via interactions between the cytoplasmic domain of Band 3 and ankyrin (3Bennett V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Since cysteines 201 and 317 reside in the predicted ankyrin-binding region of AE1, one possible consequence of the mutation of AE1 cysteines to serines is to alter the binding of ankyrin. To examine the role of these cysteine residues in ankyrin binding, AE1 proteins were expressed in HEK cells, and the binding of a radioiodinated truncated form of ankyrin was measured. In this system, AE1 has an inside-out orientation (22Ruetz S. Lindsey A.E. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) such that ankyrin may interact with the cytoplasmic surface of AE1 in the binding assay. Full-length ankyrin has a molecular mass of 206 kDa and contains 24 repeats of a 33-amino acid sequence that has affinity for the cytoplasmic domain of AE1 (33Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In the ankyrin binding assay used here, a 43-kDa truncated ankyrin molecule, with 12 33-amino acid AE1-binding repeats, was used because it is more readily overexpressed and purified, yet is able to displace bound full-length ankyrin from erythrocyte membranes with similar affinity (25Davis L.H. Otto E. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11163-11169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that AE1 expressed in HEK cells retains the ability to bind the 43-kDa fragment of ankyrin (14Ding Y. Casey J.R. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32201-32208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the binding of the 43-kDa ankyrin fragment to AE1 and AE1C− . The observed binding is saturable (Fig. 4 A) and from Scatchard analysis (Fig. 4 B) resolves into high and low affinity components. In Fig. 4 A, a single line can be drawn through the binding data from the two protein samples. The Scatchard plot (34Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17813) Google Scholar) of the same data shows that the data cluster around a common line, indicating that the binding affinity for ankyrin (curve slope = −1/ KD) and the binding capacity of the membranes (from the x intercept) are not altered by mutating the cysteines to serines. The high affinity component has a KD of 14 nM and represents 76 pmol of binding sites/mg of membrane protein, while the low affinity component has a KD of 106 n M and represents 155 pmol of binding sites/mg of membrane protein. The binding affinity observed in this assay is consistent with the KD of 5-10 n M found for the interaction of native ankyrin with AE1 in erythrocyte membranes (35Bennett V. Stenbuck P.J. Nature. 1979; 280: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 36Bennett V. Stenbuck P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6424-6432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the density of AE1 protein in the microsomal membranes is much lower than in the erythrocyte membrane, which has 49 nmol of binding sites/mg of membrane protein (37Thevenin B.J.-M. Low P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16166-16172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 644 times the density of binding sites. Together, these data suggest that the cysteine residues of AE1 can be replaced by serine without altering the affinity of AE1 for ankyrin. Anion Exchange Activity of AE1 and AE1C− -The role of the membrane domain of AE1 is to transport anions across the plasma membrane. Thus, the best criterion of whether mutation of AE1 cysteines to serines interferes with the protein's native state is the effect upon anion exchange activity. Anion exchange proteins will transport a range of anions (4Jennings M.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 397-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The assay for anion exchange activity makes use of the ability of AE1 to transport SO42−.2In this assay, microsomal membranes were reconstituted with exogenous soybean phosphatidylcholine and loaded with [35S]SO42−. Exchange for extravesicular nonradioactive SO42− resulted in a decrease in vesicular [35S]SO42− as a function of time. Fig. 5 shows [35S]SO42−/SO42− exchange mediated by vesicles prepared from HEK cells transfected with AE1 or AE1C− cDNA. From Fig. 5, the half-times of [35S]SO42− efflux for AE1 and AE1C− were both ∼2.5 min. Transport in AE1 and AE1C− vesicles could be inhibited by H2DIDS to a similar extent. To test whether the anion exchange assay was sensitive to the number of functional AE1 molecules, microsomes were prepared from HEK cells transfected with either pJRC9 (AE1 cDNA) or pRBG4 (vector alone). Microsomes were mixed at a range of ratios, and the initial rate of anion exchange was proportional to the amount of AE1 protein present over the protein range in which transport experiments were performed here. 3J. R. Casey, unpublished data. In Fig. 5, the two initial slopes (over the first 5 min) are not different from one another within the error of the experiment (AE1, 3.1% min−1; AE1C− , 2.8% min−1), suggesting that the anion exchange activity of AE1C− is not compromised by the cysteine mutations. In control experiments, vesicles prepared from cells transfected with the pRBG4 vector alone had anion exchange activity similar to that seen in Fig. 5 for AE1 vesicles assayed in the presence of H2DIDS.2Human embryonic kidney cells were originally chosen for expression of anion exchange proteins because of their very low level of background anion exchange activity (18Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, the activity seen in Fig. 5 is not due to an endogenous anion exchanger. The slight increase in intravesicular [35S]SO42− as a function of time was observed reproducibly in H2DIDS-treated samples, although the explanation for the observation is unclear. We conclude that the anion exchange function of the AE1 membrane domain is not influenced by mutation of the protein's cysteine residues to s"
https://openalex.org/W2028251130,"The plasma clearance of radiolabeled chylomicrons was compared in normal, cholesterol-fed, and Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits. Chylomicron clearance was rapid in normal rabbits but was significantly retarded in cholesterol-fed and WHHL rabbits. At 40 min after the injection of chylomicrons, 14-17% of the injected dose remained in the plasma of normal rabbits, whereas ∼40-50% of the injected dose remained in the plasma of cholesterol-fed and WHHL rabbits. The differences were reflected in the reduced plasma clearance by the liver and bone marrow of the cholesterol-fed and WHHL rabbits. The hyperlipidemic rabbits expressed normal levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor in the liver. In contrast, the hepatic levels of LDL receptors were lower in hyperlipidemic rabbits; as expected, they were significantly lower in WHHL rabbits compared with normal and cholesterol-fed rabbits. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that lipoproteins accumulating in the plasma of the hyperlipidemic rabbits competed for and retarded the clearance of chylomicrons from the plasma. Competition was demonstrated by cross-circulation of normal and cholesterol-fed or normal and WHHL rabbits, in which the rapid influx of plasma containing the accumulated plasma lipoproteins from cholesterol-fed or WHHL rabbits was shown to impair the uptake of chylomicrons by the liver and bone marrow of normal rabbits. These observations were extended by infusing isolated lipoproteins into normal rabbits. The rabbit d < 1.02 g/ml (remnant) fraction and the canine cholesterol-rich high density lipoproteins (HDL) with apolipoprotein E (HDLc) inhibited chylomicron clearance, whereas human LDL and HDL from humans and rabbits did not. We conclude that the low LDL receptor activity in the cholesterol-fed and WHHL rabbits may contribute, at least in part, to the impaired clearance by decreasing remnant uptake and causing the accumulation of chylomicron and/or very low density lipoprotein remnants. The accumulated remnant lipoproteins then compete for and saturate the mechanism responsible for the initial rapid clearance of chylomicrons from the plasma. We speculate that saturation of the initial rapid clearance may occur at the sequestration step, which involves the binding of remnants to heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the space of Disse.

Chylomicrons are the major lipoproteins responsible for the transport of dietary lipids to various tissues. Lipoprotein lipase hydrolyzes triglycerides present in the core of chylomicrons, converting them to remnants. Chylomicron remnants are rapidly cleared from the plasma, and this process is mediated primarily by apolipoprotein E (apoE) 1The abbreviations used are:apoEapolipoprotein EHDLhigh density lipoproteinsHDLccholesterol-induced canine lipoproteins containing primarily apoEHSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycansLDLlow density lipoproteinsLRPLDL receptor-related proteinVLDLvery low density lipoproteinsWHHLWatanabe heritable hyperlipidemic. 1The abbreviations used are:apoEapolipoprotein EHDLhigh density lipoproteinsHDLccholesterol-induced canine lipoproteins containing primarily apoEHSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycansLDLlow density lipoproteinsLRPLDL receptor-related proteinVLDLvery low density lipoproteinsWHHLWatanabe heritable hyperlipidemic.

The initial process responsible for the normal rapid clearance of remnants from the plasma is thought to involve a sequestration of the particles in the space of Disse. This process may involve the binding of apoE on the remnants to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) and the interaction of remnants with hepatic lipase (6Sultan F. Lagrange D. Jansen H. Griglio S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Shafi S. Brady S.E. Bensadoun A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 709-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence have now established that remnant lipoproteins bind initially to cell-surface HSPG and that, in the absence of HSPG, remnant binding and uptake are decreased even in the presence of a functional low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP) (8Ji Z.-S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, remnant binding to HSPG is necessary for the LRP to mediate uptake. Further lipolytic processing in the space of Disse may occur before recognition of the lipoprotein particles by the lipoprotein receptors. It has been shown that lipoprotein lipase facilitates the binding of remnants to the LRP (10Beisiegel U. Weber W. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Finally, uptake of the remnants via an apoE-mediated process appears to involve both the LDL receptor and the LRP (1Mahley R.W.

The LRP has been shown to bind remnants and remnant-like lipoproteins containing excess added apoE. The space of Disse is an environment rich in this apolipoprotein (21Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Guo L.S.S. Krisans S. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1589-1603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, remnants could acquire excess apoE and then be recognized by the LRP. Physiological evidence that the LRP is involved in chylomicron remnant clearance in vivo was suggested by the partial inhibition of the clearance of radioactive chylomicrons from the plasma of mice that had been injected with activated α2-macroglobulin (16Hussain M.M.

Although both the LDL receptor and the LRP have been implicated in the uptake of chylomicron remnants, it has been difficult to determine which, if either, plays the dominant role in this process.The present studies of chylomicron metabolism were conducted in rabbits, since this species has been used extensively in lipoprotein studies. It was previously shown that the liver is responsible for about two-thirds of the uptake of intravenously injected chylomicrons and that the bone marrow also takes up significant amounts (22Hussain M.M.

Brecht W.J. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17931-17938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, chylomicron catabolism by the liver increased in rabbits when the chylomicrons were incubated with apoE (22Hussain M.M. Mahley R.W. Boyles J.K. Fainaru M. Brecht W.J. Lindquist P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9571-9582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, plasma cholesterol levels decreased when apoE was infused into cholesterol-fed and Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits (24Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Hussain M.M. Greenman B. Fisher M. Vogel T. Gorecki M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 2125-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).The hyperlipidemia of cholesterol-fed rabbits is quite different from that of WHHL rabbits. High cholesterol diets cause a marked accumulation of β-migrating very low density lipoproteins (β-VLDL), which consist of VLDL remnants and chylomicron remnants (25Fainaru M. Mahley R.W. Hamilton R.L. Innerarity T.L. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 702-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kane J.P. Chen G.C. Hamilton R.L. Hardman D.A. Malloy M.J. Havel R.J.

The hyperlipidemia induced by dietary cholesterol is due to overproduction of lipoproteins and impaired plasma clearance secondary to the down-regulation of LDL receptor expression (27Kovanen P.T.

Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 435-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a genetic deficiency of LDL receptors in WHHL rabbits causes the accumulation of LDL and lesser amounts of VLDL and intermediate density lipoprotein remnant particles (for review, see Refs. 35Goldstein J.L.

Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: I33-I38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).There are conflicting reports concerning the effect of cholesterol-induced hyperlipidemia on chylomicron catabolism in different species. Chylomicron clearance has been shown to be retarded in cholesterol-fed rabbits and hypothyroid rats (32Redgrave T.G. Biochem.

Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 130-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that chylomicron clearance was normal in WHHL rabbits (42Kita T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Watanabe Y.

J. 1992; 285: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, other studies suggest that chylomicron clearance is retarded in these rabbits (44Beaumont J.-L. Assadollahi F. Atherosclerosis. 1990; 85: 103-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 45Mamo J.C.L. Bowler A. Elsegood C.L. Redgrave T.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1081: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).The present study employs the novel technique of cross-circulation of plasma lipoproteins either between normal and WHHL rabbits or normal and cholesterol-fed rabbits to examine the steps involved in the remnant pathway and to understand the mechanism involved in the development of hyperlipidemia in these rabbits. Cross-circulation eliminates the potential problem of denaturing the fragile chylomicrons and their subsequent uptake by liver Kupffer cells (46Clark S.B. Atkinson D. Hamilton J.A. Forte T. Russell B. Feldman E.B. Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 28-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate that chylomicron clearance is impaired in WHHL rabbits and in cholesterol-fed rabbits. In addition, using this technique, we demonstrate that lipoproteins present in the plasma of hyperlipidemic rabbits impair chylomicron clearance. The impairment was due, in part, to competition with endogenously derived lipoproteins containing apoE. We postulate that these lipoproteins inhibit the initial sequestration step in remnant clearance, i.e. the binding of chylomicron remnants to hepatic HSPG.DISCUSSIONThe ease of induction of hypercholesterolemia in rabbits by dietary fat and cholesterol suggests that the remnant lipoprotein clearance pathway in this species may be very sensitive to elevated lipoprotein levels. Previously, we demonstrated that the level of apoE may be rate limiting under certain conditions in the rabbit (24Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Hussain M.M. Greenman B. Fisher M. Vogel T. Gorecki M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 2125-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and clearly apoE is a critical determinant of normal remnant clearance (1Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar, 2Brown M.S. Herz J. Kowal R.C. Goldstein J.L. Curr. Opin.

In addition, hepatic lipase has been shown to be involved in remnant lipoprotein binding to cells in culture (11Ji Z.-S. Lauer S.J. Fazio S. Bensadoun A. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13429-13436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in plasma clearance (6Sultan F. Lagrange D. Jansen H. Griglio S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1042: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Shafi S. Brady S.E. Bensadoun A. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 709-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been established that the rabbit is deficient in this enzyme (54Clay M.A. Hopkins G.J. Ehnholm C.P. Barter P.J.

Circulation. 1994; 90 (abstr.): 289Google Scholar) overexpressed human hepatic lipase in transgenic rabbits and demonstrated a reduced plasma cholesterol level in these rabbits on a normal diet and a reduced tendency to develop diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Thus, impaired clearance of remnants may reflect abnormalities at one of several points in the pathway, including sequestration in the space of Disse, further lipolytic processing, or receptor-mediated uptake. Other species, such as rats (32Redgrave T.G. Biochem. J. 1973; 136: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), dogs (40Melchior G.W. Mahley R.W. Buckhold D.K. J.

Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 130-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and humans (58Rubinsztein D.C. Cohen J.C. Berger G.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Coetzee G.A. Gevers W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), may have remnant pathways that are less sensitive to dietary perturbations, and care must be exercised in trying to extend results obtained in rabbits to other species, including humans.The studies reported in this paper demonstrate that chylomicron clearance is retarded in both cholesterol-fed and WHHL rabbits. Experiments were performed to define the mechanism(s) responsible for the impaired clearance of remnant lipoproteins. Several possibilities to explain the impaired clearance of chylomicrons were considered.It was demonstrated that the retarded clearance did not appear to be due primarily to the exchange or transfer of the [14C]cholesterol or [3H]retinol from the chylomicrons to higher density lipoproteins that are cleared more slowly. Although there was a difference in the die away of the radiolabeled chylomicrons when the whole plasma clearance was compared with that of the d < 1.006 g/ml fraction, the interpretations were similar after the initial time points. It is appreciated that exchange or transfer of these radiolabeled moieties occurs (42Kita T. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Watanabe Y. Hornick C.A. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3623-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 43Demacker P.N.M. van Heijst P.J. Stalenhoef A.F.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); however, whole plasma clearance of chylomicrons is considered an appropriate measure of the metabolic activity of these lipoproteins since ultracentrifugal manipulation and time delays necessitated by lipoprotein fractionation can introduce artifacts. Clearly, the whole plasma die away reflected the trends seen with the d < 1.006 g/ml fraction.The level of apoE on the chylomicrons did not appear to be rate limiting. The addition of excess apoE to the chylomicrons did not result in an accelerated clearance of these lipoproteins from the plasma of the hyperlipidemic animals. As will be discussed later, it appears that the apoE-mediated clearance process is saturated in the hyperlipidemic animals.The retarded clearance in hyperlipidemic rabbits was not correlated with the expression of hepatic receptors. No significant difference was observed among the rabbits in the level of LRP activity. However, the level of LDL receptor expression differed among the rabbits. The cholesterol-fed rabbits had levels of LDL receptor activity that were lower than those in normal rabbits, but they expressed considerably more LDL receptor activity than was found in the WHHL rabbits. It is reasonable to conclude that the reduced expression of LDL receptors in hyperlipidemic rabbits could result in a reduced capacity of the hepatocytes to take up the remnant lipoproteins. However, since the cholesterol-fed and WHHL rabbits had similar impaired chylomicron clearance but very different levels of LDL receptor activity, the reduced expression of hepatic LDL receptors did not appear to be the primary rate-limiting factor in the reduced clearance of chylomicron remnants in these rabbits.Consistent with data from the present study is the conclusion that lipoproteins that accumulate in the plasma of cholesterol-fed and WHHL rabbits retard remnant clearance by interfering with an initial rapid phase of clearance. Cross-circulation of normal and cholesterol-fed or normal and WHHL rabbits allowed the rapid infusion of cholesterol-induced or WHHL plasma lipoproteins into the circulation of normal rabbits and allowed the determination of the acute effects of plasma lipoproteins on liver uptake. This obviated criticism of the effects of isolation on lipoprotein composition and function. Furthermore, these studies were completed within 1 h, a short time interval during which major changes in LDL receptor activity would not be expected to play a major role. The rapid influx of the hyperlipidemic plasma during cross-circulation from cholesterol-fed and WHHL rabbits retarded the liver uptake of chylomicrons in normal rabbits. We interpret these results as indicating that the competing lipoproteins saturate the early steps involved in the clearance of chylomicrons (i.e. sequestration in the space of Disse). It is reasonable to speculate that the apoE-containing remnants rapidly interact with the HSPG in the space of Disse and saturate the initial step in the remnant clearance pathway. We have established that HSPG-remnant interaction is essential for the binding of remnant lipoproteins and facilitates the actual uptake of the lipoproteins, presumably in association with the LRP (8Ji Z.-S.

However, when comparing the effects of different lipoproteins, it is difficult to know how to calculate the amount to be infused. The ideal approach would be to infuse similar numbers of particles, but this is impossible when comparing very heterogeneous lipoprotein classes such as VLDL or remnants. Therefore, we decided to inject sufficient d <1.21 g/ml, d <1.02 g/ml, and LDL to elevate the plasma cholesterol from a normal level of 30-50 mg/dl to ∼200 mg/dl. The protocol was designed to mimic the cross-circulation studies (i.e. infusion of the isolated lipoproteins, a 12-15-min period of equilibration, and completion of the study in 1 h). As shown, the d <1.02 g/ml lipoproteins (remnants and intermediate density lipoproteins) and cholesterol-induced canine lipoproteins containing primarily apoE (HDLc) inhibited chylomicron clearance (Table II). These in vivo data confirm previous results obtained in the perfused rat liver, demonstrating that HDLcinhibit chylomicron remnant clearance (53Sherrill B.C. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1804-1807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast to the inhibition seen with remnant lipoproteins and HDLc, LDL did not appear to inhibit liver uptake. Likewise, HDL did not appear to inhibit chylomicron uptake. However, since HDL are less cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, it was difficult to obtain sufficient HDL to raise the plasma cholesterol to 200 mg/dl. Nevertheless, tremendous amounts of HDL were infused and did not appear to affect chylomicron clearance. These results indicate that specific lipoproteins, e.g. apoE-containing and remnant lipoproteins, compete for lipoprotein clearance.In summary, chylomicron catabolism was markedly retarded in cholesterol-fed and WHHL rabbits. The primary factor for the retarded clearance appears to be competition of the specific plasma lipoproteins that interfere with the clearance step involved in remnant uptake, i.e. saturation of sequestration in the space of Disse. Enrichment of the remnants with apoE may not have enhanced remnant clearance because of impaired access of these lipoproteins to the already saturated binding sites involved in the sequestration phase of clearance. Chylomicrons are the major lipoproteins responsible for the transport of dietary lipids to various t"

However, considerable evidence suggests that the use of CO introduces artifacts into the reaction mechanism. We have therefore developed a rapid solution mixer with a mixing time of 20 μs to study the catalytic reaction by directly mixing the enzyme with O2without using CO. Unexpectedly, the resonance Raman scattering detected for the first 120 μs after the mixing show that the CO influences neither the structure of the primary oxy-intermediate, its rate of decay, nor the rate of oxidation of cytochrome a. This implies that CO has an effect on the later stages of the catalytic process, which may involve the proton translocation steps, and calls for the re-examination of the catalytic process by using the direct mixing method. In addition, these results demonstrate the feasibility of using the rapid mixing device for the study of biological reactions in the microsecond time domain.

Cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, reduces O2to water in a binuclear center formed by cytochrome a3and a nearby copper atom, CuB. Two additional redox centers, CuAand cytochrome a, supply electrons to the binuclear center. The enzyme harnesses the chemical energy released by the O2reduction to translocate four protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane and thus contributes to mitochondrial ATP synthesis (1Babcock G.T.

The investigation of the catalytic process of the enzyme by directly mixing the enzyme with O2(direct mixing method) has been impossible, because with a conventional stopped flow apparatus, the mixing dead time (several milliseconds) is comparable with the enzyme's turnover time (3Chance B.

Identification of iron-oxygen stretching Raman lines from many of the key intermediates have enabled the elucidation of their active site structures and the determination of their formation and decay kinetics. The rate of electron transfer from cytochrome a to cytochrome a3was determined by following the oxidation states of cytochrome a (19Han S. Ching Y.-c. Rousseau D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8408-8412Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Varotsis C. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These studies, along with site-directed mutagenesis studies of bacterial oxidases (25Hosler J.P. Ferguson-Miller S. Calhoun M.W. Thomas J.W. Hill J. Lemieux L. Ma J. Georgiou C. Fetter J. Shapleigh J. Tecklenburg M.M.J. Babcock G.T. Gennis R.B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), are helping to clarify the microscopic mechanism for oxygen reduction and proton translocation in the enzyme. It is important in such studies of the catalytic process to approach physiological conditions as closely as possible. However, initiation of the catalytic process by the CO-flash method is clearly nonphysiological, and, in fact, the question of the introduction of artifacts in the enzymatic reaction due to the photolytic initiation has been raised (5Rousseau D.L. Han S. Song S. Ching Y.-c. J. Raman Spectroscopy. 1992; 23: 551-556Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Brunori M. Colosimo A. Rainoni G. Wilson M.T. Antonini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10769-10775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both optical absorption and resonance Raman studies show that possible artifacts are induced by the CO-flash method, since the spectra of the enzyme at the end of the reaction depend on the method of initiation: the CO-flash method results in the “resting” enzyme and the direct mixing method results in the “pulsed” form (5Rousseau D.L. Han S. Song S. Ching Y.-c. J. Raman Spectroscopy. 1992; 23: 551-556Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Brunori M. Colosimo A. Rainoni G. Wilson M.T. Antonini E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12013-12024Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but it is known that the photolyzed CO coordinates to CuBwhere it is not released until a few microseconds (28Einarsdottir O. Dyer B. Lemon D.D. Killough P.M. Hubig S.M. Atherton S.J. Lopez-Garriga J.J. Palmer G. Woodruff W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12013-12024Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), a time scale similar to that for O2binding to cytochrome a3(τ = 8 μs) (11Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Wikstrom M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3079-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, time-resolved resonance Raman measurements have shown that cytochrome a3is unrelaxed until several microseconds after the photolysis of CO (29Findsen E.W. Centeno J. Babcock G.T. Ondrias M.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 5367-5372Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The CO-flash method could have a faster O2on-rate than that of the direct mixing method if the O2is already in the vicinity of active site prior to the CO dissociation. On the other hand, if the active site cannot accommodate two ligands, the presence of CO at CuBcould delay O2association. Last, the structure of the reduced enzyme in the region of the binuclear center could be quite different if generated from a CO-bound form versus a ligand-free form (26Brunori M. Colosimo A. Rainoni G. Wilson M.T. Antonini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10769-10775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These arguments suggest that anomalous results might be introduced by the use of CO especially in the early stages of the reaction. We have therefore developed a rapid solution mixer with a mixing/dead time of 20 μs and followed the first 120 μs of the reaction of cytochrome c oxidase with O2by resonance Raman scattering. The time limit of a conventional stopped flow mixer (several ms) results from the need for relatively large solution volumes (∼10 μl) required for optical absorption. When the reaction is being probed by a laser beam to obtain resonance Raman or fluorescence spectra, large volumes are not necessary. Volume elements on the order of 10 μm × 10 μm × 10 μm (∼1 pl) are sufficient to obtain high quality spectra. Moreover, by using a small volume mixer with the “continuous flow” method, the flow speed can be made very high, which accelerates the generation of turbulence in the sample flow and thus promotes efficient mixing. Using these concepts, a method for mixing two solutions on the microsecond time scale to study chemical dynamics by fluorescence was first developed by Regenfuss et al. (30Regenfuss P. Clegg R.M. Fulwyler M.J. Barrantes F.J. Jovin T.M. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1985; 56: 283-290Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Regenfuss P. Clegg R.M. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 26: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and subsequently used by Paeng et al. (32Paeng, K.-J., (1989), Resonance Raman Studies on Enzymatic Intermediates of Heme Proteins and Model Compounds. Ph.D. thesis, Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Google Scholar, 33Paeng K. Paeng I.R. Kincaid J. Anal. Sci. 1994; 10: 157-159Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) with resonance Raman scattering. We have adapted their general ideas and constructed a rapid mixing device with several modifications. The mixing point in our rapid mixer is a simple pinhole nozzle as illustrated in Fig. 1(inset). Two solutions are introduced into the mixer co-axially but do not mix until they reach the pinhole, where the flow becomes turbulent due to the sudden increase of the flow speed and the geometry of the aperture. Since the mixing time depends on the particular nozzle, we picked a nozzle with a 20-μs mixing time for the time resolved measurements. In Fig. 1(plot) the mixing time of the nozzle was determined by comparing the intensities of Raman lines from HPO42- and H2PO4- in the acid/base reaction between Na2HPO4and HCl. From this we determined that mixing was 90% complete in less than 20 μs. The nozzle aperture is 25 μm in diameter and 600 μm long. The holes in the stainless steel nozzles were made by laser drilling. The parent solutions were filtered to remove dust and transferred to gas-tight syringes with equal volumes (25 ml) where they were driven by a syringe pump at a rate of 0.64 ml/min per syringe. The time after mixing was estimated from the flow speed of the jet (43 μm/μs) which is calculated by assuming a homogeneous 25-μm diameter jet over the short distance (5 mm) between the entrance of the aperture of the nozzle and the longest time point reported here (120 μs). Time-resolved Raman scattering measurements are obtained by moving the focus point of the laser away from the nozzle exit along the sample jet. Full details of the mixing device will be described elsewhere. Cytochrome c oxidase was purified from beef heart by the method described by Yoshikawa et al. (34Yoshikawa S. Choc M.G. O'Toole M.C. Caughey W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5498-5508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme (95 μM), dissolved in 50 m M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), was reduced by adding cytochrome c and sodium ascorbate to final concentrations of 5 μM and 20 m M, respectively. The oxygen-saturated buffers were prepared by shaking the buffer solution vigorously under 1 atmosphere of either 16O2or 18O2gas. All the experiments were performed at room temperature. Resonance Raman measurements were obtained by focusing the output from a Krypton ion laser on the sample jet. The Raman scattering was dispersed and measured by a single spectrometer equipped with a liquid N2cooled charge-coupled device camera. A holographic filter was used to remove the laser scattering. The Fe-O2stretching frequency of the O2-bound enzyme generated by the CO-flash method was identified at 570 cm−1 and had a lifetime of about 50 μs (14Varotsis C. Woodruff W.H. Babcock G.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111 (Correction 112, 1297): 6439-6440J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111 (Correction 112, 1297): 6439-6440Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Han S. Ching Y.-c. Rousseau D.L. Proc. Natl.

To locate the mode by our direct mixing method, we compared the resonance Raman spectra from the heme groups after mixing the fully reduced enzyme with 16O2or 18O2saturated buffer. As illustrated in Fig. 2, we detect a strong line at 570 cm−1 for 16O2which shifts to 546 cm−1 for 18O2, thus identifying this line as the Fe-O2stretching mode in exact agreement with the frequencies obtained by the CO-flash protocol. We conclude that any possible residual CO or unrelaxed protein in the CO-flash experiments has no effect on the structure of the Fe-O2unit of cytochrome a3. We observed that the intensity of the Fe-O2stretching mode decayed to the background level within 100 μs (data not shown), also consistent with the CO-flash measurements (18Han S. Ching Y.-c. Rousseau D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2491-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 21Han S. Ching Y.-c. Rousseau D.L. Nature. 1990; 348: 89-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). An unexpected result of the CO-flash experiments was that cytochrome a was oxidized simultaneously with the decay of the primary Fe-O2intermediate (19Han S. Ching Y.-c. Rousseau D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8408-8412Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Varotsis C. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This result suggests that electron transfer from cytochrome a to oxy-cytochrome a3(k ∼ 3 × 104s−1), where the iron atoms of the two hemes have a separation of ∼18 Å, occurs faster than electron transfer from CuBto oxy-cytochrome a3(k ∼ 4 × 103s−1) where the oxygen points toward the CuBand the iron-copper distance is only 3-5 Å (35Powers L. Chance B. Ching Y. Angiolillo P. Biophys. J. 1981; 34: 465-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 36Scott R.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1989; 18: 137-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The electron transfer from cytochrome a to the binuclear center is known to be quite sensitive to the enzyme preparation (37Lodder A.L. van Gelder B.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and thus it, as well as the electron transfer dynamics between CuBand the cytochrome a3heme, could be modulated by a conformational state set by the photodissociation process or the presence of photodissociated CO near the active site. The electron transfer rate for the direct mixing method was estimated by following the oxidation state of cytochrome a (19Han S. Ching Y.-c. Rousseau D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8408-8412Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Varotsis C. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) in the high frequency resonance Raman spectra (Fig. 3). In the top trace (10 μs) the two lines in the electron density marker line (ν4) region (1356 and 1372 cm−1) show that the enzyme is largely in the reduced ligand-free state with the contribution from 1372 cm−1 coming from some O2-bound cytochrome a3. At 30 μs, the intense contribution at 1372 cm−1 indicates that cytochrome a3is almost completely O2-bound. That the high intensity of the 1372 cm−1 line at this time comes primarily from O2coordination to cytochrome a3and not oxidation of cytochrome a is confirmed by examining the 1600-1650 cm−1 region. The slight decrease in intensity at 1609 and 1624 cm−1, marker lines for reduced cytochrome a, with the concomitant increase in intensity at 1641 cm−1, a marker line for oxidized cytochrome a, indicates that only a small amount of electron transfer from cytochrome a to the binuclear site has occurred at this early time. At the next time point (50 μs) nearly half of cytochrome a has become oxidized, and at 80 μs some further oxidation of cytochrome a has taken place. No additional change is detected at 120 μs. Since cytochrome a and CuAare in equilibrium (38Morgan J.E. Li P.M. Jang D.-J. El-Sayed M.A. Chan S.I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6975-6983Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the fractional oxidation of cytochrome a is consistent with one electron transferred to the binuclear site. These results show two important features. First, O2coordination to cytochrome a3occurs within the mixing time of our apparatus. Thus, the rapid coordination of O2does not depend on it being in or near the heme pocket, as it might be in the CO-flash experiments. Second, the oxidation of cytochrome a occurs just as rapidly in the direct mixing experiments as it does in the CO-flash experiments and occurs simultaneously with the decay of the primary Fe-O2intermediate. The experiments reported here demonstrate the structural identity of the O2-bound cytochrome c oxidase prepared by the direct mixing and the CO-flash methods. The kinetic properties, including the decay of the primary intermediate and the rate of oxidation of cytochrome a, are also the same as those found in the CO-flash experiments. Thus, the photodissociation of the CO does not affect these early events, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the O2on-rate is faster in the direct mixing method. Considering the reported differences at the end of the reaction between the direct mixing and the CO-flash methods (5Rousseau D.L. Han S. Song S. Ching Y.-c. J. Raman Spectroscopy. 1992; 23: 551-556Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Brunori M. Colosimo A. Rainoni G. Wilson M.T. Antonini E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10769-10775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there must be structural changes in the enzyme that will only become evident in the properties of the later intermediates which must be clarified by further investigation. It is especially important to delineate the properties of the later intermediates, since it has been shown that they are involved in the coupling between the redox processes and proton translocation (39Wikstrom M. Nature. 1989; 338: 776-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The experiments also demonstrate the feasibility of the rapid mixing device to address a problem of current biophysical interest. We expect that this method for the study of microsecond reaction dynamics will become important in several other fields of chemical physics and biophysics."
https://openalex.org/W1987282836,"The parallel agonist-induced phosphorylation, alteration in electrophoretic mobility, and loss of ligand binding of a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein)-coupled chemoattractant receptor from Dictyostelium (cAR1) depend upon a cluster of five C-terminal domain serine residues (Caterina, M. J., Hereld, D., and Devreotes, P. N. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 4418-4423). Analysis of mutants lacking combinations of these serines revealed that either Ser303 or Ser304 is required; mutants lacking both serines are defective in all of these responses. Interestingly, several mutants, including those substituted at only Ser299, Ser302, or Ser303 or at non-serine positions within the third cytoplasmic loop, displayed an unstable mobility shift; the alteration was rapidly reversed upon cAMP removal. These mutants also exhibited subnormal extents of loss of ligand binding, which is assessed after removal of the ligand.For the wild-type receptor, we found that the stability of phosphorylation depends upon the concentration and duration of agonist pretreatment. This suggests that, following phosphorylation of Ser303 or Ser304, cAR1 undergoes a further transition (EC50 ≈ 140 n M, t½ ≈ 4 min) to a relatively phosphatase-resistant state. We used this insight to show that, under all conditions tested, the extent of loss of binding is correlated with the fraction of cAR1 in the altered mobility form. We discuss possible relationships between cAR1 phosphorylation and loss of ligand binding. The parallel agonist-induced phosphorylation, alteration in electrophoretic mobility, and loss of ligand binding of a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein)-coupled chemoattractant receptor from Dictyostelium (cAR1) depend upon a cluster of five C-terminal domain serine residues (Caterina, M.

Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The latter has been attributed in some cases to a reduction in binding affinity (32Caterina M.J.

The exact relationship between phosphorylation and reduction of binding is unclear, and may vary among different G protein-coupled receptors. Studies of acetylcholine, gastrin-releasing peptide, and cAMP receptors indicate that phosphorylation and decreases in ligand binding are coordinately regulated (2Benya R.V. Fathi Z. Battey J.F.

In contrast, the sequestration of β2-adrenergic receptors is preserved despite inhibiting receptor phosphorylation or eliminating putative phosphorylation sites by mutagenesis (1Hausdorff W.P.

In addition, in this latter system, it has been proposed that, while phosphorylation does not appear to be a prerequisite for sequestration of the β2-adrenergic receptor, sequestration is necessary for receptor dephosphorylation (7Yu S.S.

While cAR1 internalization can occur under some circumstances (14Wang M. Van Haastert P.J.M. Devreotes P.N. Schaap P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 128: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we have shown that LLB results largely from a reduction in binding affinity (32Caterina M.J. Hereld D. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4418-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cAR1 C-terminal cytoplasmic domain contains 18 serine residues organized into four clusters. Agonist binding results in the addition of 3-4 phosphates to serines within two of these clusters. The majority of this phosphorylation occurs within cluster 1 and results in a marked reduction in cAR1 electrophoretic mobility. A mutant in which the five serines of cluster 1 were substituted by site-directed mutagenesis exhibits reduced cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation and fails to undergo the electrophoretic mobility shift (15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, this mutant is markedly impaired in cAMP-induced LLB (32Caterina M.J. Hereld D. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4418-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, elimination of the other 13 serines of the cytoplasmic domain (clusters 2, 3, and 4) had little effect on either the mobility shift or LLB. These findings suggest that phosphorylation of cluster 1 and LLB are related. In the present study, we describe a detailed mutational analysis of cluster 1 and identify the specific residues required for each of these processes. We analyzed both the onset and reversal of these two processes as exhibited by mutant and wild-type cAR1s under a variety of cAMP pretreatment conditions. Our results indicate that LLB and phosphorylation of specific residues within cluster 1 are coordinately regulated upon the introduction and removal of cAMP and suggest a causal relationship between these two processes. Using site-directed mutagenesis and three previously described oligonucleotides (15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ser299 and Ser308 were independently substituted with Ala and Ser302 Ser303Ser304 was replaced with Gly-Ala-Gly. Alternatively, the same replacements of Ser302, Ser303, and Ser304 were made independently using the degenerate antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-GTACCACGAC XTG YAC XATATGGTG-3′ (where X= T or C and Y = A or C).

A. 1989; 86: 7966-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when wild-type cAR1 and selected mutants were expressed in each cell type. Clonal, stably transformed cell lines were selected and maintained in HL-5 medium (18Watts D. Ashworth J. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) containing 20 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells expressing wild-type cAR1 (MC36 cells) and mutant cm1 are described elsewhere (15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol.

Previously described third intracellular loop mutants (16Caterina M.J. Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used in this study and their amino acid substitutions (in parentheses) are as follows: A3 (R184L, Y185N, Y187S); A5 (T182S, Y187H); A22 (V188F, V189L); A42 (V189D); A53 (T182S, V188T, V189R); A60 (T186A, Y187D); and A62 (R184C, V188A, V189A). Cells, grown as shaken suspensions to densities of ∼5 × 106cells/ml, were washed with PB (5 m M Na2HPO4, 5 m M KH2PO4, pH 6.1) prior to each experiment. Washed, growth-stage cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of cAMP (22°C, shaking at 200 rpm, durations indicated in legends) in the presence of 10 m M DTT to inhibit phosphodiesterase (19Brenner M. Thomas S. Dev. Biol. 1984; 101: 136-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Where indicated, 5 m M caffeine was added to inhibit endogenous cAMP production (20Henderson E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4730-4735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of cells were combined with sample buffer (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), mixed, and stored at −20°C. These samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% or 12% low bispolyacrylamide gels (22Klein P. Theibert A. Fontana D. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1757-1764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transferred to polyvinylene difluoride filters (Immobilon, Millipore), blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, and immunoblotted using cAR1 C terminus-specific antiserum and chemiluminescence as described elsewhere (15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of immunoblots was performed using a digitizing scanner (Logitech) and SigmaScan/Image software (Jandel). Unless indicated otherwise, washed, growth-stage cells were stimulated with cAMP as described for the induction of the electrophoretic mobility shift. Unless indicated otherwise, cells were then diluted 10-fold in ice-cold PB, pelleted by centrifugation at 0−4°C (Sorvall SS34 rotor, 2000 rpm, 3 min), washed three times with ice-cold PB, and resuspended at 108cells/ml. Binding of 16 n M [3H]cAMP was then measured in PB by either a sedimentation assay (23Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) or by centrifugation through silicone oil (24Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as indicated in the figure legends. In order to synchronize the reversal of mobility shifting and LLB for cell samples treated at various cAMP concentrations, the initial two PB washes sometimes contained cAMP and dithiothreitol, as indicated in the figure legends. Reversal time is therefore defined as beginning with the initiation of the third wash, which was always with PB alone. By this convention, the 20 min time point illustrated in the figures occurs immediately after completion of the fourth wash and resuspension of the cells. We have previously demonstrated that agonist-induced phosphorylation of cAR1 within the five serines of cluster 1 (Ser299, Ser302, Ser303, Ser304, and Ser308) causes a discrete shift to a lower electrophoretic mobility form (15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is illustrated in Fig. 1 by the inability of mutant cm1, which lacks these five serines, to undergo the transition in mobility. To identify the specific serine residues required, we selectively substituted the serines of cluster 1 as indicated in Table I. As shown in Fig. 1, when the flanking residues (Ser299 and Ser308) were both substituted (mut2), the ability of the receptor to exhibit the mobility shift was unaffected. In contrast, substitution of the central three serine residues (Ser302, Ser303, and Ser304 ) in mut4, eliminated the shift. The failure of cm1 or mut4 to shift is not related to levels of expression (Fig. 1) or due to impaired binding (data not shown). These results indicate that one or more of the central three serines, but not the flanking serines, mediate the electrophoretic mobility shift. We then mutated the central three serines in various combinations. We found that each could be mutated individually without impairing the electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig. 1, mut14, mut15, and mut16). Thus, none of these serines is essential for this property. The mobility shift was markedly impaired when both Ser303 and Ser304 were mutated (Fig. 1, mut18). Furthermore, the preservation of either Ser303 or Ser304 by itself (Fig. 1, mut17 and mut19) resulted in receptors which shifted like wild-type cAR1. These results suggest that either Ser303 or Ser304 can be phosphorylated and cause the shift. The small fraction of shifted receptor in the cAMP-stimulated mut18 sample suggests that Ser302 can also mediate the shift but with lower efficiency than either Ser303 or Ser304 . Occasionally, wild-type and mutant receptors having intermediate electrophoretic mobilities upon cAMP-stimulation are observed (e.g. mut2 and mut17 in Fig. 1). These possibly represent underphosphorylated forms. We next assessed the abilities of these cluster 1 mutants to undergo LLB in order to further evaluate the relationship between this property and receptor phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2, mutants which did not undergo the electrophoretic mobility shift (e.g. cm1 and mut4) were also impaired in LLB. However, among the mutants which displayed the electrophoretic mobility shift, a spectrum of LLB behaviors was observed, ranging from those with normal LLB (e.g. mut16) to those with dramatically impaired LLB (e.g. mut15 and mut17). Wild-type cAR1 phosphorylation and the resulting mobility shift are readily reversible at 22°C but very slowly reversible at 4°C (11Vaughan R.A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Devreotes P.N. Sherring J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6378-6384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since measurement of LLB requires prior removal of the cAMP stimulus by repeated washing, it was conceivable that instability of the shifted forms of mutants such as mut15 explained the apparent incongruity of their LLB and shifting properties. To examine this possibility, the shifted forms of selected mutants were assessed at various times at 4°C following cAMP removal, including the time at which we routinely measure LLB. As shown in Fig. 3, the reversal of the mobility shift for wild-type cAR1 is extremely slow at 0°C. Nearly all of the receptor remained shifted 120 min after cAMP removal. Quantitation and extrapolation (not shown) of these data indicated that the half-time for reversal exceeds 5 h. In contrast, some of the cluster 1 mutants exhibit an increased rate of conversion of the shifted to the unshifted form. Mutation of Ser303 (mut15) dramatically reduced the stability of the shifted form (t½ < 20 min). Mutation of either Ser299 (mut1) or Ser302 (mut14) had a moderate destabilizing effect (t½ ≈ 60-120 min). Surprisingly, mutation of Ser304 (mut16), one of the two serines able to mediate the shift, had no apparent effect on stability. Mutants substituted at two cluster 1 serines exhibited stabilities consistent with those observed for single-serine substitutions. Those lacking Ser303 (mut17 and mut18) were predictably unstable (t½ < 20 min, data not shown). The intermediate stability of mut19 (t½ ≈ 20 min) can be attributed to mutation of Ser302 . In light of the instabilities of the shifted forms of cluster 1 mutants, we revised our strategy and compared the extent of LLB with the residual mobility shift of each mutant at the time of the LLB measurement. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, this analysis now revealed a significant correlation between the extent of LLB and the fraction of receptors in the shifted state, suggesting an interrelationship of these two properties. These observations prompted us to re-examine the mobility shift of cAR1 third intracellular loop mutants which we had previously found to be impaired in LLB (16Caterina M.J. Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with the cluster 1 mutants, we found that the lower mobility forms of some of these mutants were less stable than that of wild-type cAR1 (e.g. A53 and A62, Fig. 3). Inclusion of data from these mutants in Fig. 4 further strengthened the correlation between LLB and the electrophoretic shift. To further evaluate this correlation and establish its relevance to the wild-type receptor, we performed a detailed analysis of the stability of the mobility shift in wild-type cAR1 and its relationship to LLB. We first sought to assess whether the stabilization of the lower mobility form of wild-type cAR1 depended on cAMP concentration. We therefore treated cells expressing wild-type cAR1 with either 10−7 M or 10−5 M cAMP, removed the cAMP, and monitored the stability of the lower mobility receptor form. As illustrated in Fig. 5 A, each concentration elicited a complete conversion from unshifted to shifted forms. Upon removal of cAMP and incubation at 4°C, however, the stabilities of the shifted forms differed markedly. While receptors treated with the higher cAMP concentration remained completely shifted for at least 2 h, those treated at the lower concentration exhibited a time-dependent decay to the higher mobility form (t½ ≈ 60 min). Thus, as we found for the mutants, electrophoretically shifted wild-type receptors can exhibit markedly different stabilities. Their relative stabilities depend upon the cAMP concentration with which they were stimulated. To evaluate the kinetics of the stabilization, we completely converted receptors to the mobility-shifted form with 10−7 M cAMP and then exposed the cells for various times to 10−5 M cAMP (Fig. 5 B). As before, receptors exposed to only the lower cAMP concentration exhibited an unstable mobility shift. Those exposed to the higher concentration acquired stability with a t½ of approximately 4 min. Previously reported EC50 values for the cAR1 mobility shift are up to 10-fold lower than those for LLB (11Vaughan R.A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7700-7704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Devreotes P.N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4418-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To assess whether this apparent disparity could be explained by instability of shifted receptors, we undertook a detailed analysis of the cAMP concentration dependence of cAR1 mobility shifting prior to and at times following cAMP removal. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the concentration of cAMP required to convert half of the cAR1 molecules to the shifted form, or EC50, is 7 n M. Due to instability at low cAMP concentrations, the apparent EC50 values observed 20 and 150 min after cAMP removal and incubation at 4°C are 30 and 140 n M, respectively. We also assessed the concentration-dependence of LLB at the 20- and 150-min time points. The EC50 values for LLB increased with time and closely paralleled those of the mobility shift (Fig. 6 B). Lastly, we examined the relationship between the electrophoretic mobility shift and LLB of wild-type cAR1, by evaluating the kinetics of both processes. As shown in Fig. 7, the kinetics of the electrophoretic mobility shift and LLB, induced by 10−5 M cAMP and assessed immediately after cAMP removal, were nearly identical. These findings, taken together with the results of the concentration-dependence experiments, extend the correlation observed between LLB and phosphorylation in cAR1 mutants to the wild-type receptor. We have previously shown that agonist binding induces the addition of 3 or 4 mol of phosphate per mol of cAR1 to serine residues of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Phosphorylation within cluster 1, which includes Ser299, Ser302, Ser303, Ser304, and Ser308, accounts for two-thirds of the total and causes a marked decrease in cAR1's electrophoretic mobility (15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the lower electrophoretic mobility form can result from the phosphorylation of either Ser303 or Ser304 . Presumably, one or both of these two serine residues are targets of phosphorylation in the wild-type receptor. We have also previously demonstrated that agonist-induced LLB is largely due to a reduction in the binding affinity of cAR1 for cAMP. While under some circumstances receptor internalization can result from cAMP treatment, this process need not occur for LLB to be observed. Furthermore, like the electrophoretic mobility shift, LLB is markedly impaired in mutant receptors lacking all five serines of cluster 1 (32Caterina M.J. Hereld D. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4418-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Some of the substitutions of individual cluster 1 serines, described in the present report, initially appeared to break this correlation between LLB and the mobility shift. For example, substitution of Ser303 yielded a mutant, mut15, which exhibited the electrophoretic mobility shift but virtually no LLB. Careful examination, however, revealed that the lower mobility form of this mutant is abnormally unstable. When cells were washed free of ligand and incubated on ice, this receptor returned to the higher mobility form with a half-life of several minutes or less compared with hours for the wild-type receptor. Consequently, this and other similar mutant receptors are found predominantly in the higher mobility form at the time of LLB assay. The discovery of this instability prompted us to re-examine receptors with mutations in the third cytoplasmic loop that exhibit impaired LLB (16Caterina M.J. Milne J.L. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these mutants also displayed unstable mobility-shifted forms (e.g. A53). When these instabilities are taken into account, the extent of LLB is significantly correlated with the fraction of receptors in the lower mobility form at the time of LLB assay for all mutants examined. Dose-dependence and kinetics studies, presented in this report, revealed a similar correlation for the wild-type receptor. This correlation implies that the phosphorylation-dependent electrophoretic shift and LLB are sequential processes. Phosphorylation might occur first and induce a low affinity conformation either allosterically or by promoting the binding of a protein such as an arrestin homolog. Alternatively, LLB might represent the adoption of a low affinity receptor conformation that is necessary but not sufficient for subsequent phosphorylation. This possibility is supported by the observation that (Rp)-cAMPS induces LLB without causing the electrophoretic shift (26Van Haastert P.J.M. Wang M. Bominaar A.A. Devreotes P.N. Schaap P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Still, the LLB induced by (Rp)-cAMPS is unstable (reversing within minutes at 4°C), 2P. J. M. Van Haastert, personal communication. suggesting that phosphorylation might stabilize the low affinity state. Interestingly, the G protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK2 has been shown to facilitate the sequestration of mammalian m2 muscarinic receptors (3Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that similar relationships between receptor phosphorylation and agonist binding alterations may exist in other systems. We identified a variety of factors which affect the stability of the electrophoretically shifted form of the receptor. These include the dose and time of cAMP pretreatment as well as mutations within serine cluster 1 and the receptor's third cytoplasmic loop. For the wild-type receptor, low cAMP concentrations (∼10−7 M) induce the electrophoretic mobility shift. As described above, phosphorylation of either Ser303 or Ser304 could be sufficient to produce the shift. Upon cAMP removal, however, receptors phosphorylated under these conditions are rapidly dephosphorylated and return to the unshifted state with a t½ of ∼20 min at 4°C. Saturating cAMP concentrations (>10−6 M), in addition to causing the shift, trigger a process which dramatically increases the stability of the shifted form (t½ of several hours at 4°C). Assuming that the involved kinase ceases to phosphorylate the receptor after cAMP is removed, this stabilizing process must reflect either inactivation of the involved phosphatase or a change in the shifted receptor which impedes its dephosphorylation. We suspect the latter possibility is the case and that stabilization of shifted receptors might be the consequence of further phosphorylation of the receptor, beyond that required to cause the shift. Consistent with this possibility, 32P-labeling experiments have shown that the specific radioactivity of shifted receptors increases ∼2-fold during a response to saturating cAMP (11Vaughan R.A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously shown that cAMP occupancy triggers the addition of up to 2 or 3 phosphates to cluster 1 serines (15Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cAR1 mutations described in this report that impair stability of the shifted form might do so by diminishing the extent of receptor phosphorylation. For instance, mutations within cluster 1 might directly eliminate phosphorylation sites or, alternatively, might diminish phosphorylation or enhance the dephosphorylation of other cluster 1 residues. How mutations in the putative third intracellular loop might influence phosphorylation of serine cluster 1 is more puzzling. Perhaps juxtaposition of these two regions in the native receptor permits these mutations to affect the accessibility of cluster 1 to the kinase or phosphatase. Alternatively, mutations in the third loop could reduce the extent of receptor phosphorylation if, like β-adrenergic receptor kinase and rhodopsin kinase, the kinase responsible for cAR1 phosphorylation is activated by interaction with the receptor's intracellular loop domains (27Palczewski K.

Pharmacol. 1990; 30: 3S-12SCrossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that β2-adrenergic receptors must be internalized in order to be dephosphorylated (7Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This appears not to be the case for cAR1 since we observed dephosphorylation at 4°C, a temperature which should preclude vesicular traffic. Furthermore, under the conditions of our experiments, prior internalization is unlikely as nearly all cAR1 molecules remain on the cell surface following cAMP treatment (32Caterina M.J. Hereld D. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4418-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that an important role of phosphorylation might be to bring about (or maintain) a low affinity state of cAR1, possibly serving to broaden the sensitive range of cells to micromolar cAMP concentrations. Such high concentrations are transiently produced by aggregating cells and are thought to persist in multicellular structures (reviewed in Ref. 31Devreotes P.N. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 242-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It is also tempting to speculate that loss of ligand binding reflects the interaction of cAR1 to another protein, perhaps one involved in the desensitization of G protein-mediated signaling. Whatever their functions might be, the concentration-dependent stabilization of cAR1 phosphorylation and LLB, described here, is likely to be most relevant to the multicellular stage. Experiments directed at distinguishing these possibilities are in progress. We are grateful to Dr. Peter J. M. Van Haastert for valuable discussions."

Comparison of the effects on the LexA coprotease and recombination activities shows that Pro67is unique among these residues because only at this position did we find substitutions that caused differential effects on these functions. One mutant, Pro67→ Trp, displays high constitutive coprotease activity and a moderate inhibitory effect on recombination functions.

In this latter role RecA mediates the autoproteolysis of the LexA repressor, which in turn increases the expression of a number of genes including recA involved in cell survival following DNA damage (7Little J.W. Mount D.W. Cell. 1982; 29: 11-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 8Peterson K.R. Ossanna N. Thliveris A.T. Ennis D.G. Mount D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1-4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both the recombination and coprotease functions require a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) cofactor; however, coprotease activity requires only NTP binding (9Roberts J.W. Roberts C.W. Craig N.L.

Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The ATP binding site of the RecA protein contains a consensus phosphate binding loop (P-loop) 1The abbreviations used are:P-loopphosphate binding loopONPGo-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranosideATPγSadenosine 5′-0-(thiotri-phosphate). motif, a highly conserved element of sequence (12Walker J.E.

Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). The RecA P-loop motif is defined by the sequence 66GPESSGKTT74and is absolutely conserved among all eubacterial RecA proteins for which the sequence is known (1Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Grit. Rev. Biochem.

In previous mutagenesis studies, which focused on the recombination activities of RecA, we found that while the identity of the consensus residues in this motif is strictly defined (Gly66, Gly71, Lys72, and Thr73), the other residues supported varying levels of substitution (15Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1993; 232: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study we have compared the effects of mutations in the P-loop on the LexA coprotease and recombination activities of RecA and find that most mutations have similar effects on both functions. However, mutations at Pro67cause differential effects on these activities. One of these mutants, Pro67→ Trp, displays a high constitutive coprotease activity, i.e. activity in the absence of DNA damage. Repressor cleavage assays using the purified mutant protein show that the catalytic properties are similar to other constitutive RecA mutant proteins despite the fact that the amino acid substitutions occur within different areas of the protein structure. We also describe the first characterization of mutants with a rec+/coprt−phenotype, i.e. mutants that are completely defective for LexA coprotease activity in vivo but retain some level of recombinational DNA repair and/or homologous recombination activity. Our results are discussed in the context of the crystal structure of the RecA protein (14Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 17Story R.M.

MacConkey-lactose plates were prepared according to the manufacturer (Difco) and contained 0.5% lactose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Other media (LB broth and LB agar) were prepared as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and contained 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Stock solutions (4 mg/ml) of ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-β- D-galactopyranoside; Sigma) were made in Z-buffer (19Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Mitomycin C was from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. Protein concentrations in cell extract supernatants were determined using a protein assay kit from Bio-Rad or Pierce. Purified LexA protein was a generous gift from Donald Shepley and John Little (Department of Biochemistry, University of Arizona) and purified λ cI repressor was a generous gift from Bronwen Brown and Bob Sauer (Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). NTPs, dNTPs, and ddNTPs were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Radiolabeled NTPs and dNTPs were from DuPont NEN. Single-stranded RV-1 DNA, an M13 derivative (20Levinson A. Silver D. Seed B. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1984; 2: 507-517PubMed Google Scholar), was used for in vitro repressor cleavage and NTPase assays and was purified as described (21Zagursky R.J. Berman M.L. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 27: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Defined length (dA) and (dT) oligonucleotides were made using an Applied Biosystems model 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer. All mutant recA genes in this work are carried on plasmids derived from pTRecA103, a pZ150-based plasmid (21Zagursky R.J. Berman M.L. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 27: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) which has the wild type recA gene under control of Ptac(15Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1993; 232: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced using cassette mutagenesis and have been described previously (16Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Plasmid pZ150 (21Zagursky R.J. Berman M.L. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 27: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) was used as a recA−control plasmid in the in vivo assays described below. Escherichia coli strain DE1663′, which is ΔrecA and carries the lacZ and Y genes under control of the recA operator/promoter, was used for in vivo assays of both DNA repair and LexA coprotease activities of all plasmid borne recA mutants. DE1663′ was constructed by mating strain DE1663, a Δ(recA-srlR) 306::Tn 10 Δ(lac-argF) U169 sulA211 malB::Tn 9 (λ cI ind-1 recAo/p:: lacZY) derivative of AB1157, with strain DE1781 which carries an F′ lacIQlacPL8 lacZ4505::Tn 5 proA+B+episome. Both DE1663 and DE1781 were generous gifts from Don Ennis (National Institutes of Health). All in vivo assays described below were performed in the absence of isopropyl-1-thio-β- D-galactopyranoside. Under these conditions the basal level of expression of recA from pTRecA103 is approximately 20-fold greater than from the chromosomal recA gene in wild type E. coli (15Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1993; 232: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This increased basal level of expression and the inability of DNA damaging agents to increase recA expression have little or no effect on the ability to distinguish different classes of mutants using assays for both the recombination and coprotease function of RecA (15Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1993; 232: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol.

J. Bioi. Chem. 1994; 269: 26311-26322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed that all mutants in this study produced levels of RecA protein comparable to that from the wild type recA plasmid (15Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1993; 232: 1048-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because strain DE1663′ carries the lacZ and Y genes under control of a LexA-regulated promoter measurement of β-galactosidase activity is directly related to the extent of RecA-mediated LexA cleavage. Two assays were used for the measurement of β-galactosidase activity. 1) Cultures carrying plasmid borne recA mutants were grown overnight in LB-ampicillin medium at 37°C and diluted 1:40 in the same medium, and 1.5 μl was spotted onto two MacConkey-lactose plates, one containing 0.05 μg/ml mitomycin C and the other containing no mitomycin C. Plates were incubated overnight at 37°C. Colonies that express β-galactosidase activity were red, whereas those in which lacZ remains repressed by LexA were white. Control strains, DE1663′/pTRecA103 (recA+coprt+) and DE1663′/pZ150 (recA−coprt−), were included on each plate. 2) To obtain a more quantitative measure of RecA-mediated LexA cleavage, we determined the specific activity of β-galactosidase in the cell extract of each recA mutant. Overnight cultures were grown in LB-ampicillin medium, diluted 1:100 in 6 ml of the same medium, and grown for 2 h at 37°C. Cultures were divided in half, and to one half mitomycin C was added to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Incubation was continued for 40 min, cultures were chilled on ice for 20 min, and 1.5 ml of cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4°C. Cells were washed in 10 m M NaCl (1 ml) and resuspended in 1 ml Z buffer (19Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Cells were lysed by sonication on ice for 30s, centrifuged for 20 min, and supernatants were stored at 4°C. β-Galactosidase activity in the supernatants was determined using ONPG as described (19Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Units of β-galactosidase activity are defined as 10−9mol ONPG hydrolyzed/min, and activity is expressed as units/μg protein. Extracts from control strains (see above) were prepared fresh along with samples for each experiment. To determine the effect of increased time of exposure to mitomycin C on the specific activity of β-galactosidase, samples of control strains and selected mutants were processed at 60, 90, 120, and 180 min as well as 40 min. The ability of all mutants in this study to carry out homologous genetic recombination and recombinational DNA repair has been described (16Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Homologous genetic recombination was measured by determining the plating efficiency of a red−gam−Chi+λ phage on lawns of recA mutants and recombinational DNA repair was measured by observing cell survival following exposure to 4-nitroquinoline oxide and UV light (16Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present study, time courses of UV exposure were performed and fractional survival at 30 s relative to the positive control was calculated from the slope of a line obtained from a plot of relative growth versus time of exposure. For certain mutants survival time courses were performed using several different intensities of UV light. UV intensity was measured using a UVX radiometer (UVP, Inc., San Gabriel, CA). We note that recalibration of the radiometer showed that the UV dose in Ref. 16Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar was 1.52 J/m2instead of the 0.67 J/m2indicated. Both wild type RecA and the Pro67→ Trp mutant RecA proteins were purified using the following procedure. All cultures were grown in 2 × LB containing 3.8 mg/ml glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Four 1.5-liter cultures were inoculated with 50 ml of an overnight culture grown at 37°C. Incubation at 37°C was continued until A600≈ 0.8, at which time isopropyl-1-thio-β- D-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 5 m M. Incubation was continued for 3.5 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and pellets resuspended (25 ml/1.5-liter culture) in a buffer containing 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25% sucrose. Cell suspensions were quick frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. Cell lysis and extraction of the RecA protein using polyethylenimine was performed as described (24Cox M.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Bioi. Chem. 1981; 256: 4676-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to generate fraction II. Fraction II was dialyzed extensively against R buffer (20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 5 m Mβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m M EDTA) containing 50 m M NH4Cl, loaded onto a DE-52 column (30-ml bed volume) equilibrated in the same buffer, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient (300 ml) of 50-500 m M NH4Cl. Both wild type RecA and the Pro67→ Trp mutant proteins eluted at approximately 180-280 m M NH4Cl. Fractions containing RecA protein were pooled and proteins precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate. The resulting protein pellet was dissolved in 3 ml of R buffer, 30 m M NH4Cl and dialyzed extensively against the same to generate fraction III. MgCl2was then added to a final concentration of 15 m M, and the sample was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-1000 gel filtration column (1.5 × 120 cm) equilibrated in R buffer, 50 m M NH4Cl, 15 m M MgCl2. Wild type RecA and the Pro67→ Trp mutant proteins elute in pure form in the void volume of this column. Fractions containing RecA were pooled and protein precipitated as above. The precipitate was dissolved in R buffer (200-400 μl) and dialyzed extensively against the same. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 25%, and samples (≈20 μl) were quick frozen and stored at -70°C. RecA proteins were judged to be at least 95% pure in silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The concentration of wild type RecA protein was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of ε280= 0.59 mg−1ml (25Craig N.L. Roberts J.W. J. Bioi. Chem. 1981; 256: 8039-8044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of the Pro67→ Trp mutant protein was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce and by comparing the Coomassie staining intensity of a number of different samples of mutant with known amounts of wild type RecA protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. These determinations corresponded to an extinction coefficient for the Pro67→ Trp mutant of ε280= 1.2 mg−1ml. The same ε280was recently calculated for a His163→ Trp mutant RecA protein (26Stole E. Bryant F.R. J. Bioi. Chem. 1994; 269: 7919-7925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage of LexA repressor by purified RecA protein (wild type and the Pro67→ Trp mutant) was determined using the buffer described by Wang et al. (27Wang W.-B. Sassanfar M. Tessman I Roberts J.W. Tessman E.S. J. Bacterial. 1988; 170: 4816-4822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (40 μl) contained 1 μM wild type or mutant RecA protein, 1.0 m M of the indicated NTP cofactor, and 35 μM RV-1 single-stranded DNA or the indicated oligonucleotide cofactor (concentration of DNA expressed as mol PO4). Alternative nucleic acid cofactors were used as indicated. Reactions were started with the addition of LexA protein to a final concentration of 6 μM. Samples (8 μl) were removed at the indicated times, added to gel loading buffer (10 μl), heated at 95°C for 3 min, and loaded onto 15% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R, and the percentage of LexA cleavage was determined by scanning densitometry of intact LexA and LexA cleavage products (Biomed Instruments 1D/2D soft laser scanning densitometer). Cleavage of λ cI repressor was performed essentially as described (28McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6061-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 10 μM wild type or mutant RecA, 35 μM of the indicated oligonucleotide cofactor, 0.5 m M ATPγS, and 1 μM cI repressor. Following a 3.5-h incubation at 37°C the reaction was analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described for LexA cleavage. Hydrolysis of α-32P-labeled ATP, dATP, GTP, dGTP, CTP, dCTP, TTP, and UTP by purified RecA (wild type and Pro67→ Trp mutant) was measured essentially as described (29Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Bioi. Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions included the following components: 20 m M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 m M KCl, 10 m M MgCl2, 0.5 m M EDTA, 1.0 m M dithiothreitol, 0.5 m Mα-32P labeled NTP (20 μCi/ml), 2.0 μM RecA protein (wild type or Pro67→ Trp mutant), and 25 μM RV-1 single-stranded DNA. Percent NTP hydrolysis was measured by scanning polyethylenimine chromotography plates using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager equipped with Imagequant software (version 5.6). We have previously characterized 100 recA mutants carrying single amino acid substitutions in the P-loop (residues 66-74) regarding their ability to perform recombinational DNA repair and homologous genetic recombination in vivo (16Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thirty-seven of these mutants were fully or partially active for one or both of these functions, and the remaining 63 were completely inhibited for both (16Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study we have measured both the coprotease and DNA repair activities and compared the effects of each mutation on these different functions. We used two in vivo assays to measure the RecA coprotease activity toward LexA repressor and have been able to separate all mutants into three phenotypic categories: coprtc(constitutive), coprt+(inducible), and coprt−. Mutants are defined as coprtcif they form red colonies on MacConkey-lactose plates in the absence of mitomycin C (non-inducing condition) and if the average non-induced β-galactosidase activity in the cell extract is at least 1.5-fold greater than that of the positive control strain (DE1663′/pTRecA103). Mutants are defined as coprt−if they form white colonies on MacConkey-lactose plates in both the absence and presence of mitomycin C and have β-galactosidase activity in the cell extract comparable to that of the negative control strain (DE1663′/pZ150). Mutants are defined as coprt+if they form white colonies when grown on MacConkey-lactose plates in the absence of mitomycin C, form red colonies when grown in the presence of mitomycin C, and show mitomycin C induction of β-galactosidase activity in the cell extract. Six of the 37 recombination-proficient mutants showed constitutive coprotease activity, and in each case the amino acid substitution occurs at either Pro67or Thr74 (Table I). The Pro67→ Trp mutant (Table I, 67-10) is unique in that it has high coprotease activity in the absence of mitomycin C, whereas substitution of Pro67with Glu, Asp, or Gly and Thr74with Gly or Phe results in low level coprtcmutants. In an extended time course of exposure to mitomycin C, coprtcmutants with substitutions at Pro67(Trp, Glu, and Asp) show an increase in coprotease specific activity similar to wild type RecA (Fig. 1, A and B). Because the expression of recA is under the control of Ptacand, therefore, is unaffected by exposure to DNA damaging agents, this increase in specific activity may reflect a time-dependent activation and/or a slower rate of degradation of the existing pool of RecA as DNA damage accumulates.Table I:Effect of P-loop mutations on RecA coprotease and DNA repair activitiesβ-Galactosidase activity and UV survival were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Identification numbers assigned to each mutant correspond to those defined previously (16Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mutants are defined as coprtc if they show β-galactosidase activity in the absence of mitomycin C at least 1.5-fold greater than that for wild type RecA (pTRecA103). Activity for all coprt- mutants not shown (see Fig. 2) is compatible with the negative control (pZ150). Values are an average of duplicate assays and had a standard error of 18% and 15% for β-galactosidase and UV survival assays, respectively.FIG. 1RecA coprotease activity as a function of time of cell growth and exposure to mitomycin C. β-galactosidase activity in crude cell extracts was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” at 40, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min of cell growth in the absence (A and C) or presence (B and D) of 0.5 μg/ml mitomycin C. 67Trp, 67Glu, and 67Asp (A and B) are examples of coprtcmutants. 67Phe (C and D) shows a low level induction of activity, whereas 67Lys and 67Arg (C and D) are examples of coprt−mutants that show no induction of activity. The positive control is strain DE1663′ carrying pTRecA103 and the negative control is the same strain carrying pZ150 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Values are an average of duplicate assays for which the standard error was no greater than 18%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) β-Galactosidase activity and UV survival were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Identification numbers assigned to each mutant correspond to those defined previously (16Konola J.T.

Values are an average of duplicate assays and had a standard error of 18% and 15% for β-galactosidase and UV survival assays, respectively. These coprtcmutations show varying effects on recombinational DNA repair activity. For example, although the enhanced effect on coprotease activity is similar for both a Glu and Asp substitution at Pro67 (Table I), the Glu mutation has a greater inhibitory effect on recombinational DNA repair (Table II and Ref. 16Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol. Bioi. 1994; 237: 20-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, only the Pro67→ Trp mutant results in a high constitutive coprotease activity, but substitution to Trp and Gly at position 67 and to Gly and Phe at position 74 all have similar modest inhibitory effects or no measurable effect on recombinational DNA repair (Table II and Ref. 16Konola J.T. Logan K.M. Knight K.L. J. Mol.

Twenty-nine of the 37 recombination proficient mutants scored as coprt+, and although most mutants showed levels of induction comparable to wild type RecA, three showed low levels of inducible coprotease activity; Pro67→ Phe, Pro67→ Tyr, and Glu68→ Thr (Table I; 67-11, 67-12, and 68-6, respectively). The Pro67→ Phe mutant is most attenuated for coprotease induction and required longer times of exposure to mitomycin C before showing a measurable increase in activity (Fig. 1, C and D). Inducible coprotease activity was clearly observed for all coprt+mutants, including Pro67→ Phe, on MacConkey-lactose plates showing that this method is also suitable for detection of low levels of coprotease induction. Two mutants previously characterized as having partial recombination activity, Pro67→ Lys and Pro67→ Arg, showed a complete lack of coprotease activity in vivo (Table I, 67-14 and 67-16).

https://openalex.org/W2056254232,"Intracellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM-2), one of the ligands of CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), is mainly expressed on endothelial and hematopoietic cells. The biological significance of ICAM-2 has remained unclear. Previous findings have shown that a peptide from ICAM-2, spanning residues 21-42 from the first immunoglobulin domain, enhances natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and induces T cell aggregation. We have now studied the effect of the same ICAM-2 peptide on NK cell migration in the Boyden chamber assay. The peptide significantly increased NK cell migration up to 215 ± 21%, as compared to migration of control cells (100%), and the induction was inhibited by anti-CD11a monoclonal antibodies. The ICAM-2 peptide also induced polymerization of F-actin at the leading edge of migratory NK cells. Cross-linking of CD11a/CD18 receptors with anti-CD11a or anti-CD18 monoclonal antibodies and secondary antibodies resulted in receptor recycling, increased migration, and actin polymerization, but led to slight inhibition of cytotoxicity. The ICAM-2 peptide did not induce such a receptor recycling. Phosphotyrosine immunoblotting experiments showed that the ICAM-2 peptide increased the phosphorylation of 150- and 35-kDa proteins. During cross-linking with antibodies, only the 150-kDa protein showed increased phosphorylation. The results show that depending on the type of CD11a/CD18 receptor ligation different kinds of signals are transduced in NK cells. These signals may either trigger only locomotion, or both locomotion and cytotoxicity. Based on these findings, a major function for ICAM-2 on endothelium may be triggering of migration of adhering leukocytes.

While normally found mostly in blood and spleen, NK cells accumulate to sites of microbial infections, tumors (1Robertson M.J. Ritz J.

Immunol. 1983; 13: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The trafficking of NK cells to strategic sites involves the ability to respond either to soluble or surface-bound signals that stimulate cell migration. When a lymphocyte is triggered to locomote, its initial carbohydrate-mediated loose binding on endothelium is followed by firm integrin-mediated adhesion (5Lawrence M.B. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 859-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the lymphocyte spreads on endothelium, and subsequent transmigration is associated with the polymerization of actin to the leading edge of a cell, as a result of receptor-mediated signal transduction (6Dobos G.J. Norgauer J. Eberle M. Schollmeyer P.J. Traynor K.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 609-614PubMed Google Scholar). natural killer intercellular adhesion molecule lymphocyte function-associated fluorescein isothiocyanate counts/min monoclonal antibodies tetrametylrhodamine isothiocyanate phospholipase C T cell receptor. natural killer intercellular adhesion molecule lymphocyte function-associated fluorescein isothiocyanate counts/min monoclonal antibodies tetrametylrhodamine isothiocyanate phospholipase C T cell receptor. Many factors that attract leukocytes at low concentrations also increase cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (6Dobos G.J. Norgauer J. Eberle M. Schollmeyer P.J. Traynor K.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 609-614PubMed Google Scholar). This is biologically meaningful because the highest concentration of a factor exists in the actual lesion. When confronting the target cell, the NK cell stops its migration, adheres to the target mostly via β2-integrins, and the cytolytic mechanism is triggered: the Golgi apparatus, the centrioles, granules, and polymerized actin reorient toward the contact area (2Trinchieri G. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 47: 187-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar, 7Carpén O. Virtanen I. Lehto V.-P. Saksela E. Scand. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2695-2698Google Scholar, 8Carpén O. Virtanen I. Saksela E. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 2691-2697PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cytoplasmic calcium increase, inositol turnover, and protein kinase activation are associated with the function of the cytotoxic machinery (2Trinchieri G. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 47: 187-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Adhesion receptors play a pivotal role in inflammatory responses. To be able to locomote, a cell must attach to other cells or to the extracellular matrix, and cytotoxicity requires a tight and transient adhesion of the effector cell to the target. CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) is the major integrin of lymphocytes. It is a heterodimer and composed of noncovalently bound β2- (CD18) and α-subunits (CD11a). In resting circulating lymphocytes, CD11a/CD18 is in a nonadhesive conformation, and in order to become adhesive it requires triggering by an external signal. Certain anti-CD11a/CD18 mAbs (9Keizer G.D. Visser W. Vliem M. Figdor C.G. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1393-1400PubMed Google Scholar, 10Landis R.C. Bennett R.I. Hogg N. J.

Cell. 1992; 68: 341-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), can directly induce an adhesive conformation to this receptor. The avidity increase of CD11a/CD18 is also induced by signaling through certain chemotactic receptors (14Chatila T.A. Geha R.S. Arnaout M.A. J.

Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar) and through the E-selectin ligand (18Lo S.K. Lee S. Ramos R.A. Lobb R. Rosa M. Chi-Rosso G. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1493-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In stimulated NK cells, the high avidity state CD11a/CD18 receptors participate in many adhesion-dependent functions: binding to endothelial cells (19Allavena P. Paganin C. Martin-Padura I. Peri G.

Gahmberg C.G. Patarroyo M. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 46: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition to binding, CD11a/CD18 may also function as a triggering receptor in the activation of migration and cytotoxicity. Cross-linking of TCR (25Kuhlman P. Moy V.T. Lollo B.A. Brian A.A. J.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 4579-4585PubMed Google Scholar) on resting T cells results in both a high avidity state of CD11a/CD18 and rapid cell proliferation, when CD11a/CD18 is coligated. In addition, cross-linking of CD11a itself has been shown to be capable of signal transduction through calcium increase and inositol hydrolysis (28Pardi R. Bender J.R. Dettori C. Giannazza E. Engleman E.G. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3157-3166PubMed Google Scholar). Ligands for the CD11a/CD18 integrin are ICAM-1, ICAM-2, and ICAM-3. ICAM-1 differs from ICAM-2 in distribution and inducibility. Apart from mere adhesion very little is known about the biological roles of ICAMs. ICAM-1 is widely distributed, and its expression can be up-regulated by various cytokines. ICAM-2 is mainly present on vascular endothelium and lymphohematopoietic cells (29Nortamo P. Li R. Renkonen R. Timonen T. Prieto J. Patarroyo M. Gahmberg C.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2629-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A.

J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2629-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) although its expression may be increased in lymphoid malignancies (32Renkonen R. Paavonen T. Nortamo P. Gahmberg C.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 763-767PubMed Google Scholar). A costimulatory cross-talk between TCR and ICAM-1 (33Van Seventer G.A. Bonvini E. Yamada H. Conti A. Stringfellow S. June C.H. Shaw S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3872-3880PubMed Google Scholar) or ICAM-2 (34Damle N.K. Klussman K. Aruffo A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar) has been demonstrated. The ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 expression on target cells contributes to LAK cell killing sensitivity (35Akella R. Hall R.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) but not to endogenous NK cell killing (36Jackson A.M. Alexandrov A.B. Prescott S. James K. Chisholm G.D. Immunology. 1992; 76: 286-291PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a soluble 22-amino-acid long peptide from the first immunoglobulin domain of ICAM-2, but not from the homologous region of ICAM-1 activates T cell aggregation and NK cytotoxicity (37Li R. Nortamo P. Kantor C. Kovanen P. Timonen T. Gahmberg C.G. J. Biol. Cem. 1993; 268: 21474-21477Google Scholar). In the present work we show that the same peptide induces actin polymerization, redistribution of actin, and increased migration of endogenous NK cells. In addition, we show that although receptor cross-linking with CD11a- or CD18-specific mAbs resulted in actin polymerization and increased migration, it did not affect cytotoxicity. The results indicate that CD11a/CD18 alone is capable of signal transduction and that the response to outside signals depends on ligand quality. Furthermore, our results suggest a biological role for ICAM-2 in activation of cell migration. Buffy coats from healthy blood donors were obtained from the Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service. NK and T cells were isolated by Ficoll-Isopaque (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB, Uppsala, Sweden) gradient centrifugation, filtration through nylon wool columns, and by four-step Percoll (Pharmacia) gradient centrifugation in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.29 mg/ml glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described previously (38Timonen T. Saksela E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 36: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Purified lymphocytes were phenotyped by flow cytometry. Lymphocytes in the NK cell fraction consisted of 54.1 ± 9.6% of CD56+CD3-, 44.2 ± 11.7% of CD3+, and 1.3 ± 1.1% of CD14+ cells (n = 39) (mean ± S.D.). Highly purified NK cells were used in immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoblotting, and phosphatidylinositol turnover experiments. They were obtained as described by Timonen et al. (39Timonen T. Ortaldo J.R. Herberman R.B. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 153: 569-574Crossref Scopus (700) Google Scholar) : NK fraction cells from the Percoll gradients were incubated at 29°C for 45 min with sheep red blood cells at a ratio of 1:150. The sheep red blood cells with the attached CD3+ cells were removed by a subsequent Ficoll-Isopaque gradient centrifugation. The resulting cell populations contained 90.1 ± 4.8% CD56+CD3-, 4.2 ± 1.8% CD3+, and 0.3 ± 0.4% CD14+ lymphocytes. The mAbs used in migration, cytotoxicity, and phosphatidylinositol (IP) assays were: anti-CD11a (IOT16, IgG1(40Fischer A. Seger R. Durandy A. Grospierre R. Virelizier J.L. Le Deist F. Griscelli C.

The mAbs used in phenotyping were: anti-CD16, anti-CD56, anti-CD3, and anti-CD14 (anti-Leu11b, anti-Leu19, anti-Leu4, and LeuM3, respectively, all from Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Normal mouse IgG, including all subclasses (Coulter Immunology), was used as a control. Phenotypic analysis was carried out using standard procedures (23Somersalo K. Tarkkanen J. Patarroyo M. Saksela E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 590-598PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells were analyzed using a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson) flow cytometer. A 22 amino peptide (residues 21-42) from the first immunoglobulin domain of ICAM-2 (GSLEVNCSTTCNQPEVGGLETSL), and a control peptide containing the same amino acids as the ICAM-2 peptide, but in random order, except for the two conserved cysteines (EVGTGSCNLECVSTNPLSTGTEQ) were used (43Li R.

Additionally, ICAM-1 (GSVLVTCSTSCDQPKLLGIETPL) and ICAM-3 (GSLFVNCSTDCPSSEKIALETSL) peptides made from the homologous regions were used. The peptides were synthesized by t-Boc chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 430A peptide synthesizer and purified to >98% purity by high performance liquid chromatography. The quality of the purified peptides was verified by amino acid sequence analysis and mass spectrometry (43Li R. Nortamo P. Valmu L. Tolvanen M. Huuskonen J. Kantor C. Gahmberg C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17513-17518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble ICAM-2 peptide or the soluble control peptide (0-100 μg/10 × 106cells/ml) was added to lymphocyte suspensions 30 min before experiments and left in the supernatants during the assay. Activating mAbs (anti-CD18 (7E4 or IB4), anti-CD11a (IOT16), or anti-CD16 (3G8)) were added (10 μg/1 × 106cells/100 μl) at 4°C 30 min before experiments and left in the supernatants during the assay. In cross-linking experiments, the cells were first incubated with a primary mouse mAb for 30 min at 4°C, washed, and F(ab′)2fragments of goat-anti-mouse-IgG were added, incubated for 30 min at 4°C, and left in the supernatants during the assay. The Boyden chamber migration assay described by Axelsson et al. (44Axelsson L.C. Nilsson G. Björksten B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1981; 46: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used. Polycarbonate filters with pores of 3-μm diameter (Nuclepore Corporation, Pleansanton, NY) were used between the lower and upper compartments of the Boyden chambers. The lower compartments were filled with 400 μl of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% human AB serum and 0.5% human serum albumin (both from Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service). The Percoll fractionated lymphocytes were suspended in the same medium at 10 × 106/ml and activated as described above. 200 μl of lymphocyte suspensions were added to the upper compartments. As a background control to monitor passive relocation of cells to the lower compartment of the chamber, the divalent cation chelator EDTA (10 m M), which inhibits migration was used (23Somersalo K. Tarkkanen J. Patarroyo M. Saksela E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 590-598PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for indicated hours at 37°C, the amount of migratory cells in the lower chambers was counted. NK or T cell frequencies were determined by phenotyping, the amounts of migrated NK cells were calculated, and the mean values in triplicate chambers were calculated. The cell number of the EDTA-treated cells (<5% of input) in the lower chamber was subtracted from the experimental cell numbers. In some experiments the cells were treated with various concentrations of genistein (Life Technologies, Inc.), staurosporin (Sigma), or okadaic acid (Sigma) for 30 min at 37°C before the assays and left in the supernatants during the assay. Genistein and staurosporin were dissolved in Me2SO and okadaic acid in ethanol. Me2SO and ethanol at their final concentrations used had no effect on the parameters determined. The results are expressed as the mean (×± S.E.) values of repeated experiments. 1 × 106K562 target cells (45Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were labeled with 20 μCi of sodium [51Cr] (Radiochemical Centre, Amersham, United Kingdom). Various concentrations of effector cells were added in 100 μl to 100 μl of target cells 1 × 104/ml, to produce effector/target ratios 20:1, 10:1, 5:1, and 2.5:1. After a 4-h incubation at 37°C, 100 μl of the supernatant from each well was counted in a gamma counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland). The percentage of radioactivity released was calculated as follows: (EX−S)% release=−−−−−−−×100 (TOT−S)(Eq. 1) where EX = cpm released from experimental cells, S = cpm released from cells in the medium control during incubation, and TOT = total cpm incorporation into cells. Highly purified NK cells were used. For visualization of filamentous F-actin, activated NK cells were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. The cells were then incubated with tetrametylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated phallacidin (Molecular Probes Inc. Pitchford, TX) which binds to F-actin. In cross-linking experiments, unspecific Fc binding was first blocked with 20% human AB serum. The cells were incubated with the primary mAb (anti-CD18 (7E4) or anti-CD11a (IOT16)) for 30 min at 4°C, washed, and further incubated with F(ab′)2fragments of goat-anti-mouse-IgG for 30 min at 4°C, then further incubated at 37°C for various times (0-3 h), washed, and stained with the FITC-labeled rabbit-anti-goat-IgG (Cappel, Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC) for 30 min at 4°C. When indicated, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and then stained with anti-CD11a (N225, N226, and N217 obtained through the Fourth International Leukocyte Workshop), anti-CD18 (7E4), and the secondary FITC-labeled goat-anti-mouse-IgG for the detection of cytoplasmic CD11a/CD18. After washing, the cells were and fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde. Highly purified NK cells were used. 10 × 106NK cells were lysed in 50 m M HEPES, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10 m M EDTA, 100 m M NaH2PO4, 10 m M NaF, 1 m M Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. The soluble proteins were mixed in Laemmli buffer, separated in 8% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (46Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin overnight, incubated with mouse-anti-phosphotyrosine (ascites fluid 1:1000) (Sigma) for 1 h, and exposed to peroxidase-conjugated rabbit-anti-mouse IgG (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) for 30 min. Bound antibody was visualized by ECL (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The procedure described by Stand Carpén (47St A. Carpèn O. Scand. J. Immunol. 1989; 29: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was used. Activated highly purified NK cells were incubated (2.5 × 106cells/ml) in inositol-free culture medium (RPMI 1640 sine inositol, Pharmacy of Helsinki University, Finland), containing 0.5% of human serum albumin, for 24 h together with [3H]inositol 35 μCi/ml (NET 906, DuPont NEN). After washing, the cells were suspended (20 × 106cells/ml) in inositol-free culture medium containing 0.5% human serum albumin and 10 m M LiCl in order to inhibit the activity of inositol phosphate phosphatase. The cells were then activated with indicated agents for 3 min at 37°C. The inositol phosphate metabolism was terminated by the addition of methanol/chloroform (2:1) and thereafter by chloroform/water (1:1) to the cell suspensions. The water-soluble inositol phosphates were separated and fractionated on MonoQ anion-exchange (fast protein liquid chromatography) system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) with a continuous gradient of 0-0.1 M ammonium formate. One-ml fractions were collected, and the radioactivity was counted with a β-counter (LKB-Wallac, Bromma, Sweden). The statistical significance of the results in cell migration assays was evaluated by the paired t test (* = p < 0.001, = 0.001 < p < 0.01, * = 0.01 < p < 0.05). To extend the formerly described experiment, where the ICAM-2 peptide was shown to stimulate NK cell binding and cytotoxicity (37Li R. Nortamo P. Kantor C. Kovanen P. Timonen T. Gahmberg C.G. J. Biol. Cem. 1993; 268: 21474-21477Google Scholar), the effect of increasing concentrations of the soluble ICAM-2 peptide or control peptide on the migratory capacity of NK cells was examined. Freshly isolated and ICAM-2 peptide-treated peripheral blood lymphocytes were seeded on the top of filters dividing Boyden chambers into two compartments. The ability of NK cells to migrate through the filters into the lower compartments of the chamber during 4 h was determined. As shown in Fig. 1, the NK cell migration was significantly increased by the ICAM-2 peptide. The migration was dependent on the concentration of the peptide, and the plateau response was reached at 75 μg/ml. The increase of migration was inhibited by anti-CD11a (IOT16 10 μg/1 × 106cell/100 μl) mAb (not shown) although the random migration was not dependent on CD11a. ICAM-1, ICAM-3, and control peptides had no effect on the migration (not shown). In kinetic experiments, significantly increased NK cell migration was first detectable after a 4-h treatment with the ICAM-2 peptide (Fig. 2).FIG. 2Kinetics of the effect of ICAM-221-42 peptide on NK cell migration. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were activated with the ICAM-2 peptide or the control peptide and allowed to migrate. The migration of CD56+/CD3- NK cells was compared to random migration without peptide. If the number of migratory NK cells is expressed as percentage of the NK cells placed on the filters, 5, 8, and 18% of NK cells migrated through the filters during 1.5, 3, and 4 h, respectively.

We therefore wanted to examine the effect of the ICAM-2 peptide on actin polymerization in highly purified NK cells. Prior to stimulation the cells were round (Fig. 3 A), and F-actin visualized by TRITC-phallacidin was homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm. After stimulation, all NK cells spread on the substratum and obtained the morphology of migratory cells with a leading edge and a trailing edge. F-actin staining in these cells became more abundant than in control cells, and often F-actin was localized in the leading edges of the cells (Fig. 3 B). Antibody-induced cross-linking of CD11a and CD18 caused similar cell spreading and F-actin polarization as the ICAM-2 peptide did (Fig. 3, C and D). If CD11a/CD18 was not cross-linked with secondary antibody, no effect was seen (not shown). It is apparent that the induction of NK cell migration by the ICAM-2 peptide involves ligation of the CD11a/CD18 integrin. We wanted to find out whether cross-linking of CD11a or CD18 by specific mAbs would have a similar effect. As seen in Fig. 4, cross-linking of CD11a with IOT16 mAb and secondary Ab increased the migration as strongly as the soluble ICAM-2 peptide. The cross-linking of CD18 with 7E4 or IB4 mAb and a secondary Ab also increased NK cell migration, but less than the cross-linking of the α-chains. Because the ICAM-2 peptide is known to increase the cytotoxicity of NK cells (37Li R. Nortamo P. Kantor C. Kovanen P. Timonen T. Gahmberg C.G. J. Biol. Cem. 1993; 268: 21474-21477Google Scholar) (Fig. 4), we also studied the effect of CD11a/CD18 cross-linking on cytotoxicity. Cross-linking (IOT16, 7E4, or IB4) slightly inhibited cytotoxicity during the 4-h assay, as seen in Fig. 4. The cytotoxicity did not increase even if the cells were preincubated for 4 h with primary and secondary mAbs before the experiments. CD18 has a role as an adhesion receptor in the binding and migration of NK cells (23Somersalo K. Tarkkanen J. Patarroyo M. Saksela E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 590-598PubMed Google Scholar, 48Timonen T. Patarroyo M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1041-1046PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, when the IB4 epitope on CD18 antigens was covered with IB4 mAbs without cross-linking, both migration (23Somersalo K. Tarkkanen J. Patarroyo M. Saksela E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 590-598PubMed Google Scholar) and cytotoxicity (48Timonen T. Patarroyo M. Gahmberg C.G. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1041-1046PubMed Google Scholar) of endogenous NK cells were inhibited (Fig. 4). Control peptide or control mAb had no effect. Surprisingly, when the 7E4-binding site on CD18 was covered, without cross-linking, migration was inhibited but not cytotoxicity (not shown). Because cross-linking of CD18 with the mAbs (IB4 and 7E4), which cover the epitopes responsible for migration, increased migration we examined the effect of cross-linking on possible recycling of the CD11a/CD18 integrin and the re-expression of free integrin during the 3-h incubation. When the cells were treated with anti-CD11a (IOT16) or anti-CD18 (7E4) mAbs, the fluorescence intensity of the surface CD11a or CD18 molecules did not change during the 3-h incubation at 37°C. If molecules were cross-linked with the secondary Ab, the intensity of the surface CD1"

This receptor couples to Gqto activate phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C, which have been implicated as mediators of the hypertrophic response. To directly determine whether receptor coupling to Gq/PLC is sufficient to induce ANF expression, we expressed wild-type and chimeric muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) with altered G-protein coupling properties in cardiac myocytes and examined their ability to activate an ANF promoter/luciferase reporter gene. The cholinergic agonist carbachol failed to induce transcriptional activation of the ANF reporter gene through endogenous Gi-linked M2mAChRs or in cells transfected with M2mAChRs. In contrast, in cells transfected with M1mAChRs, which effectively couple to Gq/PLC, carbachol increased ANF reporter gene expression 10-fold and also increased ANF protein, as determined by immunofluorescence. Carbachol-mediated ANF gene expression was inhibited by the mAChR antagonist pirenzepine with a Kivalue characteristic of an M1mAChR. Studies using chimeric M1- and M2mAChRs demonstrated that the N-terminal 21 amino acids of the third intracellular loop of the M1mAChR were required for receptor coupling to ANF gene expression. This region, previously shown to specify receptor coupling to Gq/PLC, also conferred partial activity to a chimeric M2receptor. We further demonstrated that M1mAChR coupling to ANF gene expression was Ras-dependent since co-expression of dominant-interfering Ala-15 Ras inhibited M1mAChR-induced ANF expression by 60%. In contrast, ANF expression induced by the chimeric M2receptor was not blocked by dominant-interfering Ras. We suggest that receptor coupling to Gq/PLC is sufficient to induce ANF expression and that a Ras-dependent pathway contributes additional signals required for maximal M1mAChR-mediated ANF gene expression.

In addition Ras, a small GTP-binding protein involved in growth factor signaling pathways, has been shown to be required for α1AdrR-induced increases in cardiac cell size and gene expression (16Thorburn A.

In order to determine how G-protein-coupled receptors regulate cardiac gene expression, we have heterologously expressed wild-type and chimeric receptors that have altered G-protein/effector coupling properties. The M1muscarinic cholinergic receptor (M1mAChR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that, like the α1AdrR, activates PLC through its interaction with Gq(17Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V.

Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 459-462PubMed Google Scholar), which predominantly express M2mAChRs that regulate adenylyl cyclase through interaction with Gi(20Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W.

Sci. 1993; 14: 308-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The M1mAChR and M2mAChR are highly conserved in their transmembrane spanning regions, but vary significantly in their third intracellular (i3) loop, a region shown to confer G-protein/effector coupling specificity (22Kubo T. Bujo H. Akiba I. Nakai J. Mishina M. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Wess J. Brann M.R. Bonner T.I.

Duerson K. Ennulat D. David N. Clapham D. Peralta E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4381-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The determinants for G-protein recognition and activation appear to be shared among other receptors that utilize similar signaling pathways. For example, peptides representing the i3 loop of the M1mAChR have recently been shown to compete with the i3 loop of the α1AdrR for activation of PLC (26Hawes B.E. Luttrell L.M. Exum S.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15776-15785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that these receptors interact with G-proteins in functionally similar ways. The studies reported here demonstrate that heterologously expressed mAChRs of the M1subtype, like endogenous α1AdrRs, transduce signals leading to cardiac-specific gene expression. In contrast, expression of M2mAChRs does not transduce muscarinic receptor agonist binding into ANF gene expression. Using chimeric receptors, we demonstrate that a 21-amino acid region of the i3 loop critical for coupling M1mAChR to Gq/PLC is necessary for receptor-mediated ANF expression and can induce a partial response when exchanged for the homologous region in the M2mAChR. Expression of dominant-interfering Ala-15 Ras inhibits M1mAChR-induced ANF gene expression but does not block the response mediated by the chimeric M2receptor, suggesting that the 21-amino acid region conferring G-protein selectivity is not sufficient to couple the mAChR to a Ras-dependent pathway. Neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes from 1-3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated and cultured as described previously (15Shubeita H.E. Martinson E.A. Van Bilsen M. Chien K.R. Brown J.H.

These are: M1mAChR (cDNA encoding the human M1mAChR); M2mAChR (cDNA encoding the human M2mAChR); M1:NM2(cDNA of human M1mAChR containing amino acids 208-230 from the human M2mAChR); and M2:NM1(cDNA of human M2mAChR containing amino acids 210-230 from the human M1mAChR). The dominant-interfering Ala-15 Ras expressed in the pZip backbone was provided by Dr. Kirk Knowlton (9LaMorte V.J. Thorburn J. Absher D. Spiegel A.M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. Feramisco J.R.

Myocytes were transfected in serum-containing medium using a modified calcium phosphate transfection technique as described previously (15Shubeita H.E. Martinson E.A. Van Bilsen M. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A total of 8-10 μg of DNA was used, which consisted of the appropriate luciferase reporter gene (3 μg) and either the pCMV backbone or pCMV vector containing various receptor cDNAs (0.1-6 μg). Following transfection, cells were washed extensively, cultured in the presence of carbachol or phenylephrine for 48 h, and harvested in a 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer. Luciferase activity and protein concentration were determined for each sample as described (15Shubeita H.E. Martinson E.A. Van Bilsen M. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Myocytes were labeled overnight with 3 μCi/ml [3H]inositol in serum-free medium and [3H]inositol phosphate formation assayed in the presence of 10 m M LiCl as described (31Jones L.G. Goldstein D. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis was performed using a modification of a previously described procedure (7Knowlton K.U. Michel M.C. Itani M. Shubeita H.E. Ishihara K. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15374-15380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated on etched coverslips were transfected with the pCMV backbone or M1mAChR expression plasmid along with an RSV/luciferase reporter gene. After a 48-h treatment with carbachol or phenylephrine, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. Transfected cells were identified by immunostaining with a polyclonal anti-luciferase antibody (Cortex Biochem) followed by a fluorescein-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit antibody. ANF expression was detected by using a mouse monoclonal antibody against ANF (provided by Dr. C. Glembotski, San Diego State University) and a rhodamine-conjugated, goat anti-mouse antibody. Luciferase and ANF protein expression were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Plan-neofluar 40× objective (Zeiss). Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were transfected with the pCMV backbone or M1mAChR cDNA as described above, and membrane fractions were prepared. To determine mAChR density, membranes were incubated in a Hepes-buffered salt solution (32Braun A.P. Phan T.D. Sulakhe P.V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 189: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) with 1 n M (-)-[N- methyl-3H]QNB (a concentration 10 times its Kd) at 30°C for 60 min. Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 1 μM atropine, was <10% of total binding. For competition experiments, the assay contained 0.6 n M (-)-[N- methyl-3H]QNB and varying amounts of atropine (0.01 n M to 100 μM) or pirenzepine (0.1 n M to 30 μM). The results of competition experiments were com-puter-analyzed by using EBDA/LIGAND to obtain Kdvalues for the antagonists (32Braun A.P. Phan T.D. Sulakhe P.V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 189: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We first determined whether endogenous M2mAChRs in neonatal cardiomyocytes regulate ANF gene expression by transiently transfecting cells with an ANF promoter/luciferase reporter gene and stimulating cells with the stable acetylcholine analog carbachol for 48 h. Carbachol failed to increase luciferase expression while the α-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine caused 10-fold activation of the ANF promoter (Fig. 1 A). Subsequent experiments examining PLC activation demonstrated that carbachol caused only modest stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphate formation when compared to the robust response to phenylephrine (Fig. 1 B). This is consistent with evidence that mAChRs of the M2subtype couple poorly to PLC (23Wess J. Brann M.R. Bonner T.I. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33Fukuda K. Higashida H. Kubo T. Maeda A. Akiba I. Bujo H. Mishina M. Numa S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 18397-18403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, endogenous cardiac mAChRs show low efficacy for activation of PLC and do not couple to effectors regulating ANF expression. To determine whether ANF gene expression could be induced if Gq/PLC-linked mAChRs or a greater number of M2mAChRs were present, we transfected myocytes with the ANF reporter gene along with either the pCMV backbone vector or with human M1or M2mAChR cDNA and subsequently treated cells with carbachol for 48 h (Fig. 2). In cells transfected with the vector alone or M2mAChR cDNA, carbachol failed to induce ANF gene expression. However, in cells expressing the M1mAChR, carbachol treatment resulted in a 10-fold increase in luciferase activity. To examine the concentration dependence of this response, cardiomyocytes were transfected with various concentrations of M1mAChR cDNA. As shown in Fig. 3, concentrations of the M1mAChR cDNA as low as 0.01 μg conferred maximal responsiveness to carbachol. Furthermore, the carbachol dose-response curve was shifted to the right as the amount of receptor cDNA was decreased, suggesting a relationship between the response and the number of expressed receptors (Fig. 3).FIG. 3Dose dependence of ANF gene expression on receptor and carbachol concentrations. Cardiomyocytes were co-transfected with either 0.01, 0.1, or 3.0 μg of M1mAChR cDNA along with the ANF promoter/luciferase reporter gene. Cells were then incubated for 48 h with varying concentrations of carbachol. Luciferase activity was measured and normalized to micrograms of protein. The data are expressed as percent of maximal ANF luciferase measured at the highest carbachol concentration and represent the mean ± S.E. of duplicate or triplicate samples from 1-3 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because a relatively small fraction of the cardiomyocytes express exogenous DNA (<5% based on β-galactosidase staining), we could not detect an increase in mAChR expression using radioligand binding techniques. Thus, in binding experiments using a saturating concentration of [3H]QNB, pCMV-transfected cells had specific [3H]QNB binding of 189 ± 9 fmol/mg of protein, and M1mAChR-transfected cells had essentially the same amount of specific binding (201 ± 8 fmol/mg of protein; data not shown). We were, however, able to demonstrate that heterologously expressed M1mAChRs regulate ANF expression by using pharmacological characterization. Cells transfected with the M1mAChR and ANF reporter gene were incubated with various concentrations of the mAChR antagonists atropine and pirenzepine prior to the addition of 10 μM carbachol. The IC50values for inhibition of carbachol-stimulated ANF expression were determined from the curves shown in Fig. 4 and corrected to give estimated Kivalues for the antagonists. Kdvalues were calculated from radioligand binding competition experiments (Fig. 4). The binding constants determined for atropine in experiments examining ANF expression and radioligand binding were similar (Ki= 0.8 n M; Kd= 1.2 n M) while those for pirenzepine were markedly different (Ki= 11 n M; Kd= 600 n M). The mAChR mediating ANF gene expression therefore has about a 50-fold higher affinity for pirenzepine than does the endogenous receptor assessed by radioligand binding. The estimated Kivalue for pirenzepine antagonism of ANF expression (11 n M) is characteristic of an M1mAChR (36Hammer R. Berrie C.P. Birdsall N.J.M. Burgen A.S.V. Hulme E.C.

To determine whether carbachol induces ANF protein expression in M1mAChR-transfected myocytes, cells were transfected with M1mAChR cDNA or the pCMV backbone along with an RSV/luciferase expression vector and analyzed by immunofluorescence. Luciferase expression was used to identify transfected cells and ANF protein expression was examined for each experimental condition. About 60% of the cells transfected with the pCMV backbone vector showed increased ANF immunoreactivity when treated with phenylephrine, whether or not the cells expressed luciferase (Table I). In contrast, stimulation with carbachol increased ANF expression only in myocytes transfected with M1mAChR cDNA and exclusively in cells expressing luciferase. These data confirm results obtained from transient transfection experiments by demonstrating that ANF protein expression is induced by carbachol only in cells transfected with M1mAChR cDNA.Table I:M1mAChR-transfected cells express ANF proteinNeonatal ventricular myocytes were co-transfected with an RSV/luciferase expression plasmid along with either the pCMV backbone or M1mAChR cDNA. Cells were subsequently stimulated with 300 μM carbachol or 100 μM phenylephrine (with 2 μM propranolol) for 48 h. Transfected cells were identified by their expression of luciferase using an anti-luciferase antibody and a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. ANF protein expression was detected with an antibody against ANF and a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. The percent of ANF positive cells was calculated by dividing the number of ANF-expressing cells either by the number of cells that also express RSV/luciferase cDNA (luciferase-positive) or by the number of cells that do not express luciferase (luciferase-negative). Approximately 150 luciferase-negative and 30 luciferase-positive cells were scored for ANF immunoreactivity for each experimental condition. Neonatal ventricular myocytes were co-transfected with an RSV/luciferase expression plasmid along with either the pCMV backbone or M1mAChR cDNA. Cells were subsequently stimulated with 300 μM carbachol or 100 μM phenylephrine (with 2 μM propranolol) for 48 h. Transfected cells were identified by their expression of luciferase using an anti-luciferase antibody and a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody.

Approximately 150 luciferase-negative and 30 luciferase-positive cells were scored for ANF immunoreactivity for each experimental condition. The specificity of M1mAChR-mediated gene expression was further investigated by examining the transactivation of the cardiac-specific MLC-2 promoter and the nonspecific viral (RSV) promoter/luciferase reporter genes. In cells transfected with M1mAChR cDNA, carbachol increased MLC-2 gene expression 12-fold (Fig. 5). In contrast, carbachol did not activate the RSV promoter in these cells. These results indicate that activation of expressed M1mAChRs does not have a nonspecific effect on gene expression but is selectively coupled to activation of at least two cardiac genes known to be induced during myocardial cell hypertrophy. To examine regions of the receptor responsible for transducing signals leading to cardiac gene expression, we tested chimeric receptors in which regions of the i3 loop were altered. Initially, we tested a chimeric M1:βI2I3receptor in which the entire i3 loop and part of the i2 loop of the M1receptor were replaced with those of the β-adrenergic receptor (29Wong S.K. Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6219-6224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wong S.K. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18968-18976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This chimeric receptor failed to transduce carbachol binding into increased ANF gene expression at any cDNA concentration tested (39Ramirez M.T. Brown J.H. Wess J. Molecular Mechanisms of Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor Function. R. G. Landes Co. Biomedical Publishers, 1995Google Scholar). Similarly, a chimeric M1:NM2receptor which differs from the native M1mAChR by replacement of the N-terminal 21 amino acids of the i3 loop with the homologous region of the M2mAChR was unable to induce ANF expression even at a concentration 60 times that of the wild-type M1mAChR (compare 0.1 μg of M1 versus 6 μg of M1:NM2in Fig. 6). Both of these chimeric M1receptors are expressed at levels similar to those of the wild-type receptor in COS or A293 cells (29Wong S.K. Parker E.M. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6219-6224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2E. Ross, personal communication. We also tested a chimeric M2:NM1receptor in which the N-terminal 23 amino acids of the M2mAChR i3 loop are replaced with those of the M1mAChR i3 loop (Fig. 6). Activation of this chimeric receptor with carbachol significantly increased ANF gene expression, although the maximal response was 50% of that seen with the M1mAChR even at the highest concentrations of receptor cDNA (6 μg) or carbachol (300 μM) tested. These data demonstrate that as little as 21 amino acids from the M1mAChR confers receptor specificity for coupling to ANF gene expression. Ras has been shown to be involved in α1AdrR-mediated ANF gene expression (9LaMorte V.J. Thorburn J. Absher D. Spiegel A.M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. Feramisco J.R. Knowlton K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13490-13496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S. Powers S. Shubeita H.E. Feramisco J.R. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2244-2249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Ras was similarly involved in mAChR-mediated ANF gene expression, we transiently co-expressed either the M1or chimeric M2:NM1receptor cDNA along with a dominant-interfering Ala-15 Ras cDNA to block Ras function. M1mAChR-mediated ANF gene expression was significantly inhibited (60%) by the dominant-interfering Ras (Fig. 7). Thus, Ras appears to be a mediator of M1mAChR-induced ANF expression, as previously shown for the α1AdrR. In contrast, ANF expression induced by the chimeric M2:NM1receptor was not inhibited by the dominant-interfering Ras. Therefore, the 21 amino acids of the M1mAChR i3 loop appears to specify coupling to Gq/PLC but not to a Ras-dependent pathway. Heterologous expression of wild-type and chimeric G-protein-coupled receptors provides a new approach for studying signaling pathways that mediate hypertrophic changes in gene expression in neonatal ventricular myocytes. This approach can be used because the functional response of interest, induction of the cardiac-specific ANF gene, can be monitored in transiently transfected cells using a sensitive ANF promoter/luciferase reporter gene and by immunofluorescent detection of ANF protein. The M1mAChR is a structural and functional homolog of the endogenous α1AdrR which, we reasoned, would mimic α1AdrR-mediated hypertrophic responses and which could be experimentally modified to evaluate the functional determinants required for coupling receptors to gene expression. In order to demonstrate that transcriptional activation of the ANF gene by carbachol was occurring through the heterologously expressed M1mAChRs, we first showed that carbachol-stimulated ANF gene expression was blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine with a Kisimilar to that determined for M1mAChRs in other systems (36Hammer R. Berrie C.P. Birdsall N.J.M. Burgen A.S.V. Hulme E.C. Nature. 1980; 283: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 37Buckley N.J. Bonner T.I. Buckley C.M. Brann M.R. Mol.

We also demonstrated that the dose-response curve for carbachol shifts to higher concentrations as the amount of transfected M1mAChR cDNA is decreased (Fig. 3), suggesting that the response depends on the number of heterologous receptors expressed. Finally, only individual myocytes that expressed exogenous cDNA showed increased ANF immunoreactivity in response to carbachol (Table I). These data indicate that exogenous M1mAChRs are expressed and generate signals that lead to transcriptional activation of the ANF gene. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors have been extensively characterized in terms of their specificity for coupling to PLC and adenylate cyclase. Receptors of the M1and M3subtypes preferentially couple to the regulation of PLC via the pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein Gq, whereas M2- and M4mAChRs inhibit adenylate cyclase through interaction with Gi(21Wess J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 308-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 40Bonner T.I. Trends Pharmacol.

Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar). Specificity for effectors is largely conferred by the third intracellular loop of the G-protein-coupled receptor (22Kubo T. Bujo H. Akiba I. Nakai J. Mishina M. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 23Wess J. Brann M.R. Bonner T.I.

Duerson K. Ennulat D. David N. Clapham D. Peralta E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4381-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that there is a clear pattern of selectivity in the requirements for coupling mAChR to ANF gene expression since the M1mAChR, which couples to Gq/PLC, is effective while the endogenous and heterologously overexpressed Gi-linked M2mAChRs are not (Figs. 2 and 6). The loss of function seen with the chimeric M1:βI2I3and M1:NM2receptors in cardiomyocytes is further evidence that receptor coupling to Gq/PLC is required for ANF expression, because these and homologous M3:NM2chimeras are ineffective at stimulating PLC through Gq-dependent pathways (23Wess J. Brann M.R. Bonner T.I. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Wess J. Bonner T.I. Dorje F. Brann M.R. Mol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6219-6224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2Thus, there appears to be a high degree of selectivity and little promiscuity in mAChR receptor subtype coupling to the regulation of ANF gene expression. Remarkably, a 21-amino acid fragment was sufficient to allow the M2receptor to function like an M1mAChR in regulating ANF gene expression. This finding is consistent with the observation that this region is critical for conferring specificity for receptor coupling to PLC (21Wess J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 308-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 40Bonner T.I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 48-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The M2:NM1chimera, however, showed only about one-half the efficacy of the wild-type receptor for increasing ANF expression, even at the highest concentration tested. This could reflect a lower efficacy of the N-terminal i3 loop chimera for PLC activation, as shown for M2:NM3receptors stably expressed in A9L cells (24Wess J. Bonner T.I. Dorje F. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar); however, the M2:NM1and homologous M2:NM3chimeras are as effective as the wild-type mAChRs for inducing inositol phosphate formation in transiently transfected COS and A293 cells (23Wess J. Brann M.R. Bonner T.I. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Wong S.K. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18968-18976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2An alternative possibility is that the M2:NM1chimeric receptor has a submaximal effect on ANF expression because, while it couples efficiently to Gq/PLC, it lacks regions needed for coupling to additional downstream effectors. The observation that the dominant-interfering Ras significantly inhibited M1but failed to block M2:NM1receptor-mediated ANF gene expression suggests that the chimeric receptor lacks the ability to couple to Ras-signaling pathways. The role of Ras in α1AdrR-mediated myocardial hypertrophy has been previously demonstrated by the ability of a dominant-interfering Ras expression vector to block phenylephrine-mediated increases in cell size and ANF gene expression (16Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S. Powers S. Shubeita H.E. Feramisco J.R. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2244-2249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Ras is activated in response to α1AdrR stimulation in cardiac myocytes (42Thorburn J. Thorburn A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 43Ramirez M.T. Knowlton K.U. Brown J.H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: A385Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We report here that mAChRs must interact with a Gq-dependent pathway to induce transcriptional activation of ANF and that Ras function is also required for maximal ANF gene expression in response to M1mAChR stimulation. While it is not possible to directly demonstrate that the heterologously expressed M1mAChRs activate Ras in cardiomyocytes, the same receptor stably expressed in fibroblasts has been shown to activate Ras (44Mattingly R.R. Sorisky A. Brann M.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 14: 7943-7952Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We are currently exploring the use of adenoviral vectors to increase the transfection efficiency of cardiac myocytes so that biochemical responses such as Ras and Gq/PLC activation can be directly determined in cells expressing wild-type and chimeric mAChRs. Further studies using expression of heterologous receptors should provide insight into the question of how pathways initiated by G-protein-coupled receptors collaborate with those involving Ras to regulate cardiac cell growth and gene expression.

PSII carries out the light-induced transfer of electrons from water to plastoquinone. This reaction center is composed of integral membrane proteins that bind the prosthetic groups required for efficient charge separation. Extrinsic polypeptides are also required for oxygen evolution under physiological conditions. The prosthetic groups associated with PSII include the primary chlorophyll donor, P680, accessory chlorophylls, pheophytin, and two plastoquinone molecules, QAand QB. Upon absorption of light, P680* transfers an electron via an intermediary pheophytin to the bound quinone, QA. QA− then reduces a second plastoquinone, QB, which, unlike QA, is a two-electron acceptor P680+ oxidizes a tyrosine residue, Z, which is reduced in turn by the tetranuclear manganese cluster, the site of water oxidation. In addition to Z, PSII also contains a non0-heme oron atom, cytochrom b559, and a second redox active tyrosine, D, that forms a stable radical (for review, see Refs. 1Debus R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 269-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar and 2Barry B.A. Photochem.

Although there is no crystal structure of PSII, there is an atomic level structure of a related protein, the reaction center from purple, non-sulfur bacteria (3Deisenhofer J. Michel H. Science. 1989; 245: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Comparison of the acceptor side of PSII to the bacterial reaction center reveals both sequence and functional homology (3Deisenhofer J. Michel H. Science. 1989; 245: 1463-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, the bacterial reaction center does not oxidize water and, thus, does not contain redox-active tyrosines or a manganese cluster. Other electron transfer reactions occur in PSII that are not described above and do not occur in the bacterial reaction center. For instance, redox-active tyrosine D can be oxidized by P680+ (4Buser C.A. Thompson L.K. Diner B.A. Brudvig G.W.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6653-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because of the complex nature of electron-transfer in PSII, the competing kinetic pathways available for the reduction of the primary donor, and th epotential effects of biochemical isolation on a preparation, it is often difficult to predict a priori the redox state of a sample under steady state illumination. Difference FTIR can be used to obtain dynamic structural information about PSII. Such “reaction-induced” infrared spectroscopy allows the study of the structural changes in cofactors and protein components that accompany function. In application to PSII, light-minus-dark difference spectra provide “dynamic” structural information concerning light-induced electron transfer events. For example, previous studies have identified vibrational modes associated with the oxidation of the two tyrosine radicals, D· and Z· (11MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12MacDonald G.M. Bixby K.A. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11024-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These spectra may contain contributions from the vibrational difference spectrum, QA−− QA, in addition to contributions from the redox-active tyrosines. Isotopic labeling of tyrosine allowed these contributions to be distinguished, since tyrosine is not a precursor of the plastoquinone (12MacDonald G.M. Bixby K.A. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11024-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Also, mass spectral analysis was used to show that chlorophyll is not labeled when cultures are grown in the presence of labeled tyrosine (12MacDonald G.M. Bixby K.A. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11024-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The contributions of the acceptor side of PSII to the light-minus-dark infrared spectrum are certainly of interest. A high concentration of hydroxylamine is sometimes used as a donor in steady state illumination experiments in order to accumulate QA− (for exzmple, see Refs. 13Metz J.G. Nixon P.J. Rogner M.

At low concentratrions (approximately 50-200 μM), hydroxylamine delays the release of oxygen from active centers (16Bouges B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 234: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Bouges-Bouget B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 772-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Radmer R. Ollinger O.

Wacker U. Renger G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7852-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). At high concentrations of hydroxylamine (1-10 mM), oxygen-evolution is irreversibly inhibited because manganese is reduced and released from the reaction center (21Cheniae G.M. Martin I.F. Plant Physiol. 1971; 47: 568-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yocum C.F. Yerkes C.T. Blankenship R.E. Sharp R.R. Babcock G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In managanese-depleted preparations, hydroxylamine has been reported to inhibit exlectron transfer between Z and P680 (23Ghanotakis D.F. Babcock G.T. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 231-234Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has also been reported to act as a donor to tyrosine Z (13Metz J.G. Nixon P.J. Rogner M. Brudvig G.W. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6960-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). For a review of the use of hydroxylamine n the study of PSII, see Debus (1Debus R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 269-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). High concentrations of hydroxylamine have been used previously in difference (light-minus-dark) FTIR spectroscopy in an attempt to identify structural changes on the acceptor side of PSII (24Berthomieu C. Nabedryk E. Mantele W. Breton J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PSII membranes were used in this work (25Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). These membranes were treated with the inhibitor, DCMU, to block electron transfer from QAto QB. The resulting difference spectrum was considered to be the vibrational spectrum of QA−− QA. The presence of hydroxylamine was assumed to eliminate any donor side contributions to the spectrum. Assignments to the semiquinone anion and the quinone were made by group frequency arguments and comparison to in vetro model studies. The PSII redox component, contributing to the difference spectrum, was found to be very long lived. This spectrum, assigned as predominantly QA−− QA (24Berthomieu C. Nabedryk E. Mantele W. Breton J.

However, some FTIR studies of PSII are not consistent with these previous assignments to QA− and QA. For example, an intense line at 1478 cm−1 was attributed to the C-O vibration of the semiquinone anion radical by Berthomieu et al. (24Berthomieu C. Nabedryk E. Mantele W. Breton J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When Z· and D*middot; are 2H- or 13C-labled, unlablled QA− should still contribut to the difference spectrum (30Barry B.A. Babcock G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7099-7103Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and yet only a weak vibrational mode at approximately 1480 cm−1 is observed under these conditions (12MacDonald G.M. Bixby K.A. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11024-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Bernard M.T. MacDonald G.M. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J. Barry B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1589-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Further, this line is sensitive to 15N labeling (31Bernard M.T. MacDonald G.M. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J. Barry B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1589-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Also, a spectrum similar to the one reported by Berthomieu et al. (24Berthomieu C. Nabedryk E. Mantele W. Breton J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) has been obtained in a study of photosystem II membranes to which no hydroxylamine has been added (27Noguchi T. Ono T.-A. Inoue Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5953-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Araga C. Akabori K. Sasaki J. Maeda A. Shiina T. Toyoshima Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1142: 36-42Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this case, the donor side should contribute to the difference infrared spectrum, and there is no reason to expect that the difference spectrum should be dominated by QA−− QA contributions (32Thibodeau D.L. Nabedryk E. Hienerwadel R. Lenz F. Mantele W. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 253-259Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have reinvestigated the redox state of PSII reaction centers in the presence of hydroxylamine. We have used EPR spectroscopy as a control for our difference infrared studies. Samples were prepared in the same way for both EPR and FTIR experiments, that is, dehydrated on solid substrates. Our work shows that steady state illumination in the presence of hydroxylamine results in the reversible production of a chlorophyll cation radical in approximately 5% of the centers. We present evidence that this level of chlorophyll contribution to the difference infrared spectrum is detectable. Further, we show that global labeling of photosystem II with 15N causes a 2 cm−1shift of the most intense spectral feature, the positive 1478 cm−1line. A 2 cm−115N shift is inconsistent with the previous assignment of the 1478 cm−1 line to QA− (24Berthomieu C. Nabedryk E. Mantele W. Breton J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, this shift is consistent with assignment of this line to a vibration of the chlorophyll macrocycle (33Boldt N.J. Donohoe R.J. Birge R.R. Bocian D.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 2284-2298Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Donohoe R.J. Frank H.A. Bocian D.F. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Potential carbonyl vibrations from the ester and keto groups of chlorophyll are also observed in the spectral region between 1750 and 1650 cm−1. We conclude that the difference spectrum obtained in the presence of hydroxylamine contains contributions from chl+− chl. PSII membranes were prepared as in Berthold et al. (25Berthold D.A. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1640) Google Scholar) and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 m M MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 15 m M NaCl, and 25% glycerol. This preparation is not monodisperse, but is in the form of membrane sheets that can be pelleted by centrifugation. The purified PSII membranes evolved oxygen at rates of approximately 600 μmol of O2/mg of chl·h. The membranes were manganese-depleted by the addition of hydroxylamine from a stock that contained 50 m M hydroxylamine, 1 m M EDTA, 50 m M MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 15 m M NaCl, and 25% glycerol. This stock was made up immediately before use. The final concentration of hydroxylamine in the membrane sample was 10 m M. After addition of hydroxylamine, the membranes were agitated in darkness for 80 min at 0°C. The membranes were diluted 1:4 by the addition of a buffer containing 50 m M MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 15 m M NaCl, and 25% glycerol. After hydroxylamine treatment, the membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 19,000 rpm in a SS-34 rotor. The pellets were resuspended in a buffer that contained 5 m M MES-NaOH, pH 6.0. The membranes were pelleted again as described above and resuspended in 5 m M MES-NaOH, pH 6.0. The final chlorophyll concentration was 4.0 mg/ml. PSII complexes were prepared, manganese-depleted, and concentrated as in (11MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Bernard M.T. MacDonald G.M. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J. Barry B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1589-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As purified, the PSII complexes had a specific activity of 1100-1200 μmol of O2/mg of chl·h. The final resuspension buffer was 5 m M MES-NaOH, pH 6.0. Unlike PSII membranes, this preparation is detergent solubilized and is monodisperse. The PSII complexes do not contain functional QB(11MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The final chlorophyll concentration was 1.3 mg/ml. Cyanobacterial PSII particles from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were prepared as previously described (35Noren G.H. Boerner R.J. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and had a specific activity of 2300-3000 μmol of O2/mg of chl·h. PSII particles were hydroxylamine-treated as described elsewhere (11MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Bernard M.T. MacDonald G.M. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J. Barry B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1589-1594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except the incubation time was only 40 min. The manganese-depleted PSII particles were then concentrated as in MacDonald and Barry (11MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Global isotopic labeling with 15N was performed as previously described (31Bernard M.T. MacDonald G.M. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J. Barry B.A. J. Biol.

Spectrom. 1990; 1: 72-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) of acetone extracted chlorophyll was used to verify isotopic incorporation. Mass spectra were obtained on a Kratos MS25 mass spectrometer. The sample was ionized by fast atom bombardment through the use of an 8-KeV xenon beam. The matrix was 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol, and positive ions were detected. Immediately before EPR and FTIR spectroscopy, hydroxylamine was added to either the PSII membranes or PSII complexes to a final concentration of 10 m M. For the cyanobacterial PSII complexes, the final hydroxylamine concentration was 6 m M. In some cases, potassium ferricyanide also was added to a final concentration of 3 m M. Oxygen-evolving PSII complexes used for cryogenic FTIR were prepared as previously described (11MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and were in 25% glycerol, 50 m M MES (pH 6.0), 7.5 m M CaCl2, 0.05% lauryl maltoside (Anatrace, Maumee, OH), and 260 m M NaCl. PSI was purified from the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, by the procedure described in Noren et al. (35Noren G.H. Boerner R.J. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The manganese-depleted PSII membranes and complexes were dehydrated on mylar substrates as in MacDonald and Barry (11MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Membrane samples contained 280 μg of chlorophyll. The PSII complex samples contained 400 μg of chlorophyll. Spectra were recorded at −9 ± 2°C as described by MacDonald and Barry (11MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Spectra were obtained at X band using the following conditions: modulation amplitude, 3.2 G; microwave power, 0.67 mW; scan time, 4 min; time constant, 2 s; gain, 3.2 × 104. Spin quantitation was performed at −160°C on samples that had been illuminated at −9°C and then frozen in darkness. The amount of the light-induced radical was quantitated by double integration of the EPR signal using the program, IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Fremy's salt was used as a spin standard (38Babcock G.T. Ghanotakis D.F. Ke B. Diner B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 276-286Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Wertz J.E. Bolton J.R. Electron Spin Resonance. Chapman & Hall, New York1986: 462-464Google Scholar). The g value was determined by using the chlorophyll radical in purified PSI as a standard; the PSI sample was dehydrated on a mylar substrate. The EPR spectrum was obtained at −9°C. The g value of the chlorophyll radical in PSI is known to be 2.0025 (40Hoff A.J. Amesz J. Photosynthesis: New Comprehensive Biochemistry. Vol. 15. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 97-124Google Scholar). FTIR Spectroscopy at −9°C-Samples contained 50-70 μg of chlorophyll for spinach samples and 20-30 μg of chlorophyll for Synechocystis PSII particles. All PSII preparations were dried on a germanium-coated window as described by MacDonald and Barry (11MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Spectral conditions were as previously described (11MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The absorbance in the amide I band at 1655 cm−1was always <0.9 absorbance units. Spectra were recorded at −9°C. The spectral resolution was 4 cm−1, the mirror velocity was 1.57 cm/s, and 1000 scans were co-added for each interferogram. The difference spectrum was constructed by directly ratioing the interferogram obtained under illumination to the interferogram obtained in the dark and then converting to absorbance units. Five to seven difference spectra were averaged in order to obtain the final data. The sample contained 30 μg of chlorophyll. Spectral conditions were as described above. The temperature was controlled to ±0.1 K with a High-Tran liquid nitrogen cryostat (R. G. Hansen & Associates, Santa Barbara, CA) and a temperature control unit (Scientific Instruments model 9620, West Palm Beach, FL). The absorbance of the amide I band was 0.7 absorbance units. Spectra were recorded at 80 K, and 1000 scans were co-added to construct each interferogram. Difference spectra were constructed by the method described above. Two difference spectra were then averaged in order to obtain the final spectrum. In Fig. 1, we present EPR spectra recorded on PSII membranes in the presence of hydroxylamine alone (Fig. 1B) and in the presence of hydroxylamine and potassium ferricyanide (Fig. 1A). The presence of hydroxylamine will lead to accumulation of QA− under illuminations (15MacDonald G.M. Boerner R.J. Everly R.M. Cramer W.A. Debus R.J.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11441-11448Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and prevent the accumulation of Z· (23Ghanotakis D.F. Babcock G.T. FEBS Lett. 1983; 153: 231-234Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 43Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1448-1454Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum of QA− is not detectable at room temperature because it is strongly relaxed by a nearby non-heme iron (44Nugent J.H.A. Diner B.A. Evans M.C.W. FEBS Lett. 1981; 124: 241-244Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 45Evans M.C.W. Diner B.A. Nugent J.H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 97-105Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 46Rutherford A.W. Mathis P. FEBS Lett. 1983; 154: 328-334Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar-47Rutherford A.W. Zimmermann J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 767: 168-175Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Potassium ferricyanide is used in some samples in order to provide an electron acceptor. In the presence of hydroxylamine alone or in the presence of hydroxylamine and ferricyanide, EPR spectroscopy (Fig. 1, A and B, solid line) shows that a chlorophyll radical is present under illumination. The line width (7.5 G) and g value (2.0025) of this radical are both consistent with a chlorophyll origin (40Hoff A.J. Amesz J. Photosynthesis: New Comprehensive Biochemistry. Vol. 15. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 97-124Google Scholar, 48Miller A.-F. Brudvig G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Spin quantitation of the spectra recorded under illumination (Fig. 1, A and B, solid line) indicates that the chlorophyll radical is present in approximately 10-20% of the centers. This is in contrast to earlier results, which reported no chlorophyll radical present when hydroxylamine was added as a reductant (26Berthomieu C. Nabedryk E. Breton J. Boussac A. Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. Vol. II. Kluwer Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 53-56Google Scholar). Note that the level of detection was not specified in this earlier study. A difference in the decay of this chlorophyll signal is observed when samples containing hydroxylamine alone (Fig. 1B) are compared to samples containing ferricyanide and hydroxylamine (Fig. 1A). In the presence of ferricyanide, the chlorophyll radical is reduced by approximately 15% in 8 min (Fig. 1 A, compare dot-dashed and solid line). Approximately 30% of the radical has decayed after 90 min (Fig. 1 A, compare the dotted line and solid line). If ferricyanide is not present in the PSII membranes, only <10% reduction is seen after 90 min of dark adaptation (Fig. 1B, dotted line), showing that, in the presence of hydroxylamine alone, the formation of the chlorophyll radical is relatively irreversible. To summarize, our EPR results show that, when both hydroxylamine and ferricyanide are present, a chlorophyll radical is produced reversibly in approximately 5% of the centers. However, in the presence of hydroxylamine alone, less than 1% of the centers reversibly produce a chlorophyll radical. We would expect that QA− is accumulated under illumination in both cases due to the presence of hydroxylamine (15MacDonald G.M. Boerner R.J. Everly R.M. Cramer W.A. Debus R.J. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4393-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 41Rogner M. Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6189-6196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Buser C.A. Diner B.A. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11441-11448Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The decay time of QA− under these conditions is not easily measurable. It should be noted that the EPR line shape of the radical varies from sample to sample, as does the amount of radical produced. Some samples exhibit a broader EPR signal that contains contributions from the tyrosine radical, D·, in addition to chlorophyll contributions (data not shown). The presence of hydroxylamine in high concentrations leads to this variability, which is not observed in infrared studies of PSII in the absence of hydroxylamine (for example, see Refs. 11MacDonald G.M. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9848-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and 12MacDonald G.M. Bixby K.A. Barry B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11024-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, high concentrations of hydroxylamine are problematic in experiments conducted under steady state illumination. FTIR Spectra of PSII Membranes at −9°C-Light-minus-dark difference FTIR spectra recorded on PSII membranes are shown in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2, A and B, both ferricyanide and hydroxylamine are present. In Fig. 2 A, there was a short dark adaptation time of 8 min between the light and dark spectra. In Fig. 2B, there was a long dark adaptation time of 90 min between the light and dark spectra. Both sets of data were obtained on the same sample, and both difference spectra exhibit strong vibrational modes. These are the conditions where our EPR experiment predicts that a chlorophyll radical will make the largest contribution to the spectrum. An increase in intensity is observed when Fig. 2B is compared to Fig. 2A. This increase in intensity roughly correlates with the results of our EPR experiment (Fig. 1A) that showed a more extensive decay of the chlorophyll radical in 90 min than in 8 min. The use of hydroxylamine leads to some variability in the relative intensities of t"

In contrast, the two chimeric antibodies lacking the Cμ4 domain were almost entirely monomeric. Both monomeric chimeras had reduced ability to activate complement. The chimera γγμγ had no activity under any of the assay conditions, whereas μμγγ caused only a small amount of cell lysis but was fully active in consuming complement at 4°C. The polymeric chimera γγμμ was much less active than IgM, bound C1 weakly and caused some cell lysis but consumed little complement with soluble antigen. The polymeric chimera μμγμ bound C1strongly and was the most active antibody in all assays, even more active than the parental IgG2b and IgM antibodies; it was the only antibody that exhibited antigen-independent activity.

Complement fixation by IgG and IgM antibodies involve different mechanisms. IgG antibodies have an exposed complement binding site located in the Cγ2 domain.

IgM is a naturally occurring polymer synthesized in two forms containing either five IgM monomers and a J chain, or six IgM monomers and no J chain, arranged in a ring with the Fab′s pointing outward. Each IgM monomer (μ2L2) is homologous in architecture to IgG, although instead of a hinge, the IgM possesses an extra domain, designated Cμ2, and is much less flexible than IgG.

Since multiple binding sites for C1 should be present on pentameric and hexameric IgM, a single IgM attached to a red blood cell is sufficient for complement binding and activation (Borsos and Rapp, 1965aBorsos T.

However, since unbound IgM binds C1q and C1 weakly (Poon et al., 1985Poon P.H. Phillips M.L. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9357-9365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Poon and Schumaker, 1991Poon P.H. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5723-5727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and does not consume complement, it is generally held that efficient interaction with C1 requires conformational changes among the IgM monomers which only occur upon interaction with antigen. A “distortional” model for complement activation in which the Fab2are bent toward the cell surface when IgM binds multivalently to a cluster of epitopes, converting the IgM “starfish” to the “table” or “staple” conformation with exposed C1 binding sites has been proposed (Feinstein and Munn, 1966Feinstein A.

The technique of domain switching has been profitably employed to examine the role of the hinge and Cγ2 domain in complement fixation (Norderhaug et al., 1991Norderhaug L. Brekke O.H. Bremnes B.

Immunol. 1990; 145: 3842-3848PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, domain exchange between a human IgM and a mouse IgG2b has been employed in a study of complement fixation and activation. A preliminary report of a similar study using mouse IgM has appeared (Chen et al., 1994Chen F.H. Isenman D.E. Shulman M.J. Arya S.D. Painter R.H. FASEB J. 1994; 8: A767Google Scholar). The present studies indicate that the context of the C1 binding site is important in determining the efficiency of complement activation. Construction of Plasmids and Production of Antibodies The plasmid pUCγ was constructed by subcloning into pUC19 (New England BioLabs) a 3.7-kilobase pair XbaI- BglII fragment of genomic DNA containing Cγ1, hinge, Cγ2, and Cγ3 of mouse IgG2b. The plasmid pUCμ was generated by subcloning the 3.6-kilobase pair XbaI fragment of genomic DNA containing Cμ1, Cμ2, Cμ3, and Cμ4 of human IgM from a plasmid derived from pN-X-μTNP (Boulianne et al., 1984Boulianne G.L. Hozumi N. Shulman M.J. Nature. 1984; 312: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) into pUC19. Unique NotI and MluI sites were generated by partial digestion of these plasmids with the appropriate restriction enzymes, isolation of singly cut plasmids by agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligation with NotI or MluI linkers, containing the appropriate adaptor and about 15 base pairs of the intron sequence (synthesized using the Gene Assembler, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). A NotI site was introduced at the SacI site in the intron 5′ to Cγ2, and an MluI was introduced at the PpuMI site in the intron 3′ to Cγ2. (Fig. 1, construct i). NotI and MluI sites were introduced at the PpuMI sites flanking the Cμ3 domain. (Fig. 1, construct ii). The NotI and MluI sites were used together with the unique SalI sites to generate four additional constructs, labeled iii, iv, v, and vi in Fig. 1. Each of these constructs was then joined to the mouse anti-dansyl 1The abbreviations used are:dansyl (or DNS)5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresismAbmonoclonal antibodySRBCsheep red blood cellsTBSTris-buffered salinegpSguinea pig serumgpSCguinea pig serum complementNHSnormal human serumNHSCnormal human serum complementEAsheep red blood cells optimally sensitized with hemolysin.

The mixture was then diluted to 1 ml with cold TBS++, centrifuged, and assayed for cell lysis by absorbance at 412 nm. Controls without mAb included tubes without serum, tubes with serum, and tubes with serum plus water as diluent. For the soluble antigen, polylysine with an average of 560 monomer units (Sigma) was dansylated with an input of 28 mol of dansyl-chloride/mol polylysine, and approximately 17 mol of dansyl were incorporated. Consumption assays were performed according to Stollar, 1978Stollar B.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 18: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, with minor modifications. For the complement consumption step, 100 μl of TBS++containing the indicated concentrations of mAb and antigen, and gpS (1/100) or NHS (1/50) was incubated either at 37°C for 1 h or at 4°C for 18-21 h. Then SRBC optimally sensitized with hemolysin, EA, were added, the mixture diluted to 0.7 ml (final EA concentration, 1 × 107ml−1), and further incubated at 37°C for 40 min, centrifuged, and assayed for cell lysis by absorbance at 412 nm. The amounts of EA and complement had been predetermined such that, in the absence of consumption, cell lysis was 80-90% complete. Controls included tubes without mAb and tubes without antigen. Results reported for complement consumption employed a single concentration of polylysine, predetermined using fixed concentrations of mAb i and mAb ii. Each of the gene constructs shown in Fig. 1 was used to transfect TSW2 cells, a cell line producing a chimeric light chain composed of the murine anti-dansyl variable domain and human Cκ. Antibodies were isolated from the cell culture medium by affinity chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” yielding in each case 1-2 μg of purified protein/ml of culture medium. On reducing SDS-PAGE, each antibody exhibited only two bands: a 23-kDa light chain and a heavy chain whose relative size was consistent with the expected product. Western blots with anti-human-μ and anti-mouse-γ2b also indicated that domain switching had occurred in each of the chimeric antibodies (Table I).Table I:Summary of Western blotting, ultracentrifuge, and SDS-PAGE analysis of the affinity-purified, recombinant antibodies Sedimentation coefficients and the relative amounts of monomer and polymer formed by each chimera were determined by analytical ultracentrifugation (Table I) and confirmed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The correspondence between the results obtained with the two methods indicated that the 7 S monomers and the 18 S polymers were formed by covalent inter-heavy chain disulfide bonds. In murine IgG2b, these inter-heavy chain disulfide bonds are located in the hinge, whereas in the human IgM, they were located at Cys337of Cμ2, forming an intrasubunit disulfide, and at Cys414of Cμ3 and Cys575of the Cμ4 tail piece, forming intersubunit disulfides (Davis et al., 1989Davis A.C. Roux K.H. Pursey J. Shulman M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the parental IgG2b (γγγγ) and IgM (μμμμ) were assembled as monomer and polymer, respectively, as expected. For the different chimeras, γγμγ yielded practically all monomer, although it contained Cys414; μμγμ which lacked Cys414, but contained Cys575, yielded about 43% monomer and 57% polymer; μμγγ, possessing only the intrasubunit Cys337, produced only monomer, as expected, and although γγμμ contained both Cys414and Cys575, it was nevertheless defective in polymer assembly, since 29% was secreted as monomer. In summary, only the mAb's containing Cμ4 with Cys575present in the tail piece gave rise to appreciable amounts of polymer, with μμμμ > γγμμ > μμγμ. Since the expressed chimeric antibodies possessed identical anti-dansyl Fab, any differences in complement activation should reflect the differences in the constant regions. Differences in complement activation were studied employing both human (NHSC) and guinea pig (gpSC) complement, and complement consumption assays were performed at both 37 and 4°C. Direct lysis of dansyl-coupled sheep red blood cells employed a large excess of NHSC and gpSC of comparable hemolytic activity. Results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that recombinant human IgM was equally active with NHSC and gpSC, whereas recombinant mouse IgG2b was more active with gpSC. Polymeric IgM also activated complement at much lower concentrations than monomeric IgG as had been reported previously using polyclonal antibodies (Ishizaka et al., 1968Ishizaka T. Tada T. Ishizaka K. J. Immunol. 1968; 100: 1145-1153PubMed Google Scholar; van der Zee et al., 1986van der Zee J.S. Beuvery E.C. van Ree R. Aalberse R.C. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For the chimeric antibodies containing Cμ3, γγμγ was inactive in the cell lysis assay, whereas γγμμ was more effective than the parental IgG2b with NHSC, but less effective than parental IgM. For the chimeric antibodies containing Cγ2, the data show μμγμ to be more hemolytically active with both NHSC and gpSC than either parental antibody. This monoclonal antibody was 57% polymer, and presumably it was the polymer which possessed the strong lytic activity, but this was not determined. In marked contrast, the ability of the monomeric μμγγ to promote cell lysis was barely detectable. The chimeric antibodies were also examined in an indirect assay which measured complement consumption by antibody-antigen complexes. In this assay, diluted NHSC or gpSC containing nanomolar C1 and an optimal amount (4-8 n M) of dansyl polylysine were incubated with varying concentrations (1-100 n M) of mAb. The amount of complement remaining at the end of the incubation period was then determined using a separate hemolytic assay. The results of these complement consumption assays are shown for NHSC (Fig. 4) and gpSC (Fig. 5). These data show γγμγ to be inactive in all assays, whereas γγμμ exhibited slight activity only with NHSC at 37°C. It is noteworthy that compared with IgM, γγμμ was much less active in this consumption assay than in promoting lysis at the cell surface. μμγγ, barely active in the direct assay with both NHSC and gpSC, also was barely active in the indirect assay at 37°C with NHSC, but showed no activity with gpSC; however, its activity was comparable with IgG2b when assayed at 4°C. In the indirect assay, μμγμ was again the most active of all of the antibodies. Recombinant human IgM was most active with NHSC at 37°C; in contrast, recombinant mouse IgG2b was most active with gpSC at the lower temperature. These differences were reported previously for polyclonal IgM (Cunniff and Stollar, 1968Cunniff R.V. Stollar B.D. J.

At 0.12 M ionic strength, binding of 18.0 S C1 by the 18.8 S parental IgM gave rise to a faster, broader 22 S (median) boundary, probably representing a mixture of the unassociated species reversibly equilibrating with weakly associated 1:1 and 2:1 (C1:IgM) complexes (Poon and Schumaker, 1991Poon P.H. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5723-5727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When mixed with C1, μμγμ showed three peaks in the ultracentrifuge, probably representing the 7.8 S unassociated (trailing) monomer, the excess 18 S C1, and a 30.2 S boundary probably representing a mixture of strongly associated 1:1 and 2:1 C1:polymer complexes. The mixture of γγμμ and C1 yielded two peaks, probably the 7.2 S unassociated monomer and a 19 S peak representing unassociated species in equilibrium with very weakly associated complexes. When the ionic strength was increased only moderately from 0.12 to 0.15 (Fig. 7 B), the binding was practically abolished with γγμμ, and much diminished with IgM, probably reflecting the 6th power dependence on ionic strength previously reported for the binding between C1q and IgM (Poon et al., 1985Poon P.H. Phillips M.L. Schumaker V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9357-9365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the decreased sedimentation coefficient for C1 at the higher ionic strength (16.6 S versus 18.0 S) and the pronounced trailing boundary indicated that the C1 complex was less stable at the higher ionic strength, probably dissociating reversibly into its 10 S C1q and 8.5 S C1r2C1s2subcomponents. This enhanced dissociation of C1 would have contributed to the decreased binding of C1 by weakly binding IgM and γγμμ. In contrast, for the mixture of C1 and μμγμ, complex formation was almost unaffected by the increase in ionic strength, reflecting a much tighter binding between this chimera and C1. Murine IgG2b and the human IgM were employed as the parent genes for generating through exon exchange the four constructs encoding the chimeric immunoglobulins. Within experimental error, the two parental IgG2b and IgM proteins were entirely 6.9 S monomer and 18.8 S polymer, respectively, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation and gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Both of these antibodies, purified by affinity chromatography, appeared uncontaminated by significant quantities of other proteins. For the parent IgM, the two intersubunit disulfides were probably formed, because mutant IgM lacking either of these have been reported partially defective in assembly (Davis et al., 1989Davis A.C. Roux K.H. Pursey J. Shulman M.J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2519-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The parental immunoglobulins behaved as expected in the direct lysis experiments employing sheep red blood cells coated with dansyl-coupled, anti-sheep (Fab′)2and guinea pig complement. The IgM parent achieved 50% cell lysis at 0.2 μg/ml IgM, whereas the IgG2b parent reached 50% at about 3 μg/ml of protein. The greater efficiency of IgM compared with IgG on a weight basis in cell lysis probably reflects the requirement for only a single IgM to establish a complement activation site, whereas at least two IgG must be bound in close proximity (Borsos and Rapp, 1965aBorsos T. Rapp H.J. J. Immunol. 1965; 95: 559-566PubMed Google Scholar, Borsos and Rapp, 1965bBorsos T. Rapp H.J. Science. 1965; 150: 505-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar; Ishizaka et al., 1968Ishizaka T. Tada T. Ishizaka K. J. Immunol. 1968; 100: 1145-1153PubMed Google Scholar). In cell lysis experiments, not only must complement be bound and activated, but additional interactions between antibody and C4b appear to be critical as well (Ziccardi, 1986Ziccardi R.J. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 3378-3383PubMed Google Scholar); clearly both parental antibodies were capable of supporting all the required reactions. The parental immunoglobulins also behaved as expected in the consumption assays employing soluble dansylated polylysine as antigen. The mechanisms involved in consumption have not been fully clarified; however, in contrast to the direct lysis experiments where only a small fraction of the added complement need be activated to cause cell lysis, the complement consumption experiments req"

The N-terminal half and the C-terminal half of the propeptide were replaced by random sequences at the genetic level, and collections of the mutants were subjected to a colony screen for ones exhibiting activity. A high frequency (around 1%) of active constructs was found, which indicates a very high tolerance for mutations in the propeptide. Thirty-nine functional mutant forms containing random sequence at either the N- or C-terminal half of the propeptide were characterized.

Secretory enzymes often undergo extensive post-translational modifications before the mature form is generated. In many cases, these include proteolytic removal of parts of the polypeptide as well as glycosylation.

Proteinase A (PrA) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a vacuolar aspartic protease, which is synthesized as a precursor of 405 amino acids encoded by PEP4 (Fig. 1) (1Ammerer G. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H.

Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2500-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). PrA follows the paradigm outlined above; thus, in the ER, a signal sequence of presumably 22 amino acids is cleaved off, carbohydrate chains are added at two positions, and the zymogen (proPrA) folds into a transport-competent conformation (3Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The zymogen transits further through the Golgi complex where the carbohydrate side chains are modified, resulting in an increase in molecular mass of about 1 kDa. Upon arrival in the vacuole, an N-terminal propeptide of 54 amino acids is autocatalytically removed, yielding mature PrA of 42 kDa (4van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. Eur. J.

We hypothesized that the degradation is due to misfolding and thus that the propeptide is required for correct folding of the enzyme region (5van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18002-18007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of propeptides in folding of proteases has recently been studied in detail for several serine proteases (for review, see Ref. 6Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Few reports, however, have dealt with the sequence requirements in the propeptides for this process (7Kobayashi T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 931-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Ramos C. Winther J.R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7006-7012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several observations suggested that there was no strong requirement for sequence conservation in the PrA propeptide. This prompted us to study these requirements using a more radical approach. Large parts of the propeptide-encoding segment of PEP4 were replaced by random nucleotide sequences, and collections of the mutants were screened for ones that exhibited activity in vivo. Many mutants exhibiting activity were found, indicating that many sequences can functionally replace the PrA propeptide. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains W3094 (MAT a ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 his3-Δ200 pep4-1137) and W3122 (MAT a ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 his3-Δ200 pep4-1137 prb1::LEU2) have been described previously (4van den Hazel H.B.

Strain JHRY20-2C- Δpep4 (MAT a ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 his3-Δ200 pep4::LEU2) (kindly supplied by J. H. Rothman and T. H. Stevens, University of Oregon) was constructed by introduction of the LEU2 gene in the HindIII restriction site of the PEP4 gene in JHRY20-2C (1Ammerer G. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H. Saari G.C.

Yeast was grown in YPD and SC media (13Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). Low sulfate MV/Pro medium (14Stevens T.H. Rothman J.H. Payne G.S. Scheckman R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was used in pulse-labeling/immunoprecipitation experiments. E. coli was grown in LB, SOC, and 2 × YT medium (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA polymerase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and T4 DNA ligase were from Promega, Madison, WI. Klenow polymerase and thermolysin were from Boehringer Mannheim. [35S]Methionine for protein labeling was from DuPont NEN. Zymolyase 100-T was from Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan. Fixed Staphylococcus aureus cells were IgGsorb from The Enzyme Center, Malden, MA. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380A DNA synthesizer, desalted on NAP-5 columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 10 m M Tris-HCl, 1 m M EDTA, pH 8.0, and used as primers in PCR and sequencing experiments. PCR was performed using Pfu DNA polymerase from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, or Taq DNA polymerase from Perkin Elmer Corp. DNA subcloning steps and transformations of E. coli and yeast were carried out using standard procedures (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Sequencing was performed using custom synthesized primers, a Taq Dye Deoxy™ Terminator cycle sequencing kit, and an API 373A DNA Sequencer, both from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA. Plasmid pBVH32 was constructed by subcloning the pep4-23Δ76-containing SacI- XhoI fragment from pBVH11 (5van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18002-18007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into pRS315 (16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which had been opened with SacI and XhoI. In order to introduce a SacI restriction site, two annealed oligonucleotides, 5′ GGG CCC GAG CTC CAT ATG A 3′ and 5′ AGC TTC ATA TGG AGC TCG GGC CC 3′, were ligated into pSEY8 (17Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), which had been opened with SmaI and HindIII, generating pBVH30. A PCR was performed using pBVH9 (5van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18002-18007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template and the M13 forward 24-mer primer (Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and the oligonucleotide 5′ CGG CCG AAG CTT TAT GCC GGC CTC GAG TAA ATG AGC TAA ATG TTG CTC 3′ as primers. The 0.6-kilobase PCR product was isolated, digested with SacI and HindIII, and ligated into pBVH30, which had been opened with SacI and HindIII, generating pBVH36. This plasmid thus contains a pep4 allele, which is truncated after the codon for residue 50. This codon is followed by a XhoI site, 9 base pairs as a spacer fragment, and a HindIII site. Sequencing of the truncated pep4 allele of pBVH36 showed that no unintentional mutation had been introduced. In order to introduce BamHI and SmaI restriction sites, two annealed oligonucleotides, 5′ AAA GGA TCC CCC GGG CCC GCC 3′ and 5′ GGC GGG CCC GGG GGA TCC TTT 3′, were subcloned into pBVH11, which had been opened with NaeI, generating pBVH37. A SmaI- PvuII fragment from Yep24 (18Botstein D. Falco S.C. Steward S.E. Brennan M. Scherer S. Stinchcomb D.T. Struhl K. Davis R.W. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) containing the tetracycline-resistance gene was subcloned into pBVH37, which had been opened with SmaI, generating pBVH38. A PCR was performed with pBVH17 (5van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18002-18007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as template and the oligonucleotides 5′ ATT CGC GTC GAC CTC GAG AAG TAC TTG ACT CAA TTT GAG 3′ and 5′ GCA GCA GGT ACC CCG CAT CAT CGG GCT ACC CGC 3′ as primers. The 1.4-kilobase PCR product was isolated, digested with SalI and Asp718 and subcloned into pBVH38, which had been opened with SalI and Asp718 generating pBVH48. This plasmid thus contains a pep4 allele in which the codons for residues 24-52 have been replaced by a BamHI site, part of the tetracycline-resistance gene, and a XhoI site. Sequencing of the pep4 open reading frame of pBVH48 showed that no unintentional mutation had been introduced. A collection of plasmids encoding mutant PrA propeptides in which the propeptide's C-terminal half was replaced by random sequences (“C-half- in- trans” collection) was constructed using a mixture of oligonucleotides. This mixture was generated using two mixtures of bases: mixture “N,” composed of 25% of each base, and mixture “L,” composed of 4% A, 32% T, 32% C, 32% G. The oligonucleotides had the following sequence: 5′ G TCG ACA AGC TTA GAT ATC NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL CTC GAG GGT ACC GGC 3′ in which N indicates a base from mixture N, and L indicateds a base from mixture L. The NNL combination was chosen to reduce the frequency of STOP codons. The oligonucleotides in the mixture were made double-stranded using the oligonucleotide 5′ GCC GGT ACC CTC GAG 3′ and Klenow polymerase, digested with HindIII and XhoI and subcloned into pBVH36, which had been opened with HindIII and XhoI. Plasmid DNA isolated from pools of individual transformants from the C-half- in- trans collection was digested with SacI and EcoRV and subcloned into pBVH11, which had been opened with SacI and NaeI. This generated new pools of plasmids (C-half in cis collection), encoding mutant precursors in which the C-terminal half of the propeptide was replaced by random sequences. Plasmids numbered pBVH1201 to pBVH1336 are from this collection. A mixture of oligonucleotides with the sequence: 5′ GGT ACC CTC GAG NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL NNL GGA TCC GCC GGC GGG 3′, in which N and L are bases from the same base mixtures as above, was generated. The oligonucleotides were made double-stranded using the oligonucleotide 5′ CCC GCC GGC GGA TCC 3′ and Klenow polymerase, digested with BamHI and XhoI and subcloned into pBVH48, which had been opened with BamHI and XhoI. This generated a collection of plasmids encoding mutant PrA forms in which the N-terminal half of the propeptide was replaced by random sequences (“N-half in cis” collection). A SacI- HindIII fragment of pBVH17, containing the upstream part of PEP4, was subcloned into pSELECT (19Lewis M.K. Thompson D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which had been opened with SacI and HindIII, generating pBVH41. Plasmids pBVH42, pBVH43 and pBVH44 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis on pBVH41 using the following oligonucleotides: O1, 5′ GCT CAT TTA GGC CAA GCG TAC TTG ACT CAA TT 3′; O2, 5′ CAA CAT TTA GCT CAT TTA CTC GAT AAG TAC TTG ACT CAA TTT 3′; and O3, 5′ TTT AGG CCA AAG GTA CTT GAC TC 3′, respectively. The site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (19Lewis M.K. Thompson D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), with the modifications described by Olesen and Kielland-Brandt (20Olesen K. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). SacI- HindIII fragments from pBVH42, pBVH43, and pBVH44 were subcloned into pBVH17, which had been opened with SacI and HindIII, generating pBVH45, pBVH47 and pBVH46, respectively. The part of pep4 in these plasmids that was derived from the mutagenesis procedure was sequenced. This verified the mutations and showed that no other mutation had been introduced. A PCR was performed with pBVH47 as template and the M13 forward 24-mer primer and the oligonucleotide 5′ AAT CTA GAT ATC GAA GAA AGG ATG CTC CCT 3′ as primers. The PCR product was isolated, digested with SacI and EcoRV, and ligated into pBVH11, which had been opened with SacI and NaeI, generating pBVH63. Another PCR with pBVH47 as template, and the oligonucleotides 5′ CAA GTT GCT GCA AAA GGA TCC AAG GCT AAA ATT TAT AAA 3′ and 5′ GAC CAC CTT ATC AAC AGA 3′ as primers was performed. The product of this PCR was isolated, digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into pBVH48, which had been opened with BamHI and XhoI, generating pBVH64. The part of pep4 in pBVH63 and pBVH64 that was derived from the PCR product was sequenced. This showed that no unintentional mutations had been introduced. Carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) activity was determined qualitatively by plate overlay with the substrate N-acetyl- DL-phenylalanyl-β-naphthylester as described by Jones (21Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). PrA activity was determined using an internally quenched fluorescent peptide substrate essentially as described previously (5van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18002-18007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present experiments, however, the better substrate 2-aminobenzamide-Leu-Phe-Ala-Leu-Glu-Val-Ala-Tyr(3-NO2)-Asp, kindly provided by Kirsten Lilja and Morten Meldal, was used. Pulse labeling, immunoprecipitation, and gel electrophoresis were carried out essentially as described previously (22Winther J.R. Stevens T.H. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using previously described antibodies against PrA (4van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and CPY (23Winther, J. R., 1989, Studies on the functions of glycosylation of the yeast vacuolar proteases carboxypeptidase Y and proteinase A. Ph.D. thesis. University of Copenhagen.Google Scholar). [35S]methionine (100 μCi) was used for labeling instead of [35S]H2SO4, and cultures were chased by the addition of 5 μl of 1 M Na2SO4and 5 μl of 5 mg/ml methionine. We constructed a collection of plasmids containing mutant PrA prosequences in which 22 codons encoding the C-terminal half of the propeptide were replaced with random DNA of the same length and tested whether the mutant propeptides could function in trans. A multicopy plasmid (pBVH36) was constructed that contained the first 50 codons of PEP4 (the presequence and the first 28 codons of the prosequence) behind its natural promoter. The 50th codon was followed by a XhoI restriction site and, further downstream after a spacer fragment, a HindIII restriction site. A mixture of oligonucleotides containing random codons was generated. The oligonucleotides in the mixture were made double-stranded, digested with XhoI and HindIII, and inserted into pBVH36. A collection of 17,000 independent E. coli transformants (C-half- in- trans collection) was obtained. The correct constructs encode mutant PrA propeptides in which residue 50 is followed by Leu-Glu (encoded by the XhoI restriction site), followed by 22 random residues, followed by Asp-Ile (encoded by the EcoRV restriction site). Two thousand transformants were collected from plates into pools of 300-350 each, plasmid DNA was isolated from each pool and introduced into a yeast strain (W3094) already producing PrA-23Δ76. About 1000 yeast transformants were obtained from each pool, and it was tested whether they exhibited CPY activity. PrA is required for the activation of a number of vacuolar hydrolases, including CPY. The plate assay used for CPY activity is a very sensitive assay for the presence of PrA activity, as strains having as little as 2-3% of the wild-type intracellular PrA activity are detected as CPY-positive (5van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18002-18007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). None of the transformants exhibited CPY activity, indicating that none of the mutant propeptides could efficiently assist formation of an active enzyme in trans. The interaction between the propeptide and the enzyme region in trans is not very efficient, and even when the wild-type propeptide is overproduced relative to the enzyme region, less than 10% of the wild-type activity is found (5van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18002-18007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the observation that none of the randomized propeptides could interact productively with the enzyme region when supplied in trans did not exclude that they could do so when covalently linked to the N terminus of the enzyme region (in cis). To test this, we divided 15,000 E. coli transformants from the C-half- in- trans collection over 20 independent pools, isolated plasmid DNA, and inserted the prosequence-containing SacI- EcoRV fragments into a plasmid (pBVH11), which contained the sequence coding for the enzyme region of PrA (Fig. 2). Twenty new pools of transformants were obtained, each pool containing 150-600 independent E. coli transformants, corresponding to a total of 6500 (C-half in cis collection). Each desired plasmid encodes a PrA precursor form in which residues 51-76 have been replaced by Leu-Glu (encoded by the XhoI restriction site), followed by 22 random codons, followed by Asp (half of the EcoRV restriction site). The mutant precursors are thus one residue shorter than the wild-type. Furthermore, 25 codons encoding the N-terminal half of the PrA propeptide were replaced with random DNA of the same length to investigate the sequence requirements of this part of the propeptide (Fig. 3). A collection of 6500 individual transformants (N-half in cis collection) was obtained. Each desired plasmid encodes a PrA precursor form in which residues 24-52 have been replaced by Gly-Ser, followed by 25 random codons, followed by Leu Glu. The transformants were divided over 59 pools, and plasmid DNA was isolated from each pool.FIG. 3Propeptide-sequences of plasmids isolated from a collection of plasmids in which the N-terminal half of the PEP4 prosequence was replaced by random sequences. PrA activities in strains producing the mutant precursors. Only residues 22 to 52 are shown. The top 19 plasmids (above the dashed line) were sampled from CPY-positive transformants of a Δpep4 strain. The sequence between the dashed lines is the corresponding wild-type sequence. The propeptide sequences of six plasmids that could not complement the CPY-negative phenotype of the Δpep4 strain are shown below the dashed line. Strain W3094 was transformed with the indicated plasmids, and specific PrA activity was determined in cell extracts derived from two or three individual transformants grown at 23°C. The value shown is the average activity as a percentage of the average activity detected in extracts from strain W3094 carrying pBVH17, which produces wild-type PrA. The indicated variation is the calculated standard deviation. The background activity detected in a Δpep4 strain (about 2%) has been subtracted from the values. The black arrow indicates the enzyme region, open bars indicate the presequence, shaded bars indicate part of the prosequence that is wild-type, while other bars indicate randomized regions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The plasmids from the C-half in cis collection were introduced into yeast to test whether any of the mutant precursors could form active enzyme. A Δpep4 Δprb1 double mutant (W3122) was chosen as genetic background for the screen. The vacuolar protease precursors in yeast are proteolytically activated via a cascade with several redundancies. Initiation of the cascade is dependent on PrA, and PrA can activate the CPY precursor (proCPY) and the precursor of the PRB1-encoded proteinase B (proPrB). However, PrB can also activate proPrB and proCPY and by this way amplify the initiation of the cascade by PrA (4van den Hazel H.B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Winther J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Hirsch H.H. Schiffer H.H. Wolf D.H. Eur. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8990-8998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in a prb1 strain, the threshold level of PrA activity necessary for a CPY-positive phenotype is higher than in a wild-type PRB1 strain. A prb1 strain can therefore be used to select PEP4 mutants exhibiting relatively high PrA activity. Transformation of strain W3122 with the 20 plasmid pools of the C-half in cis collection gave a total of 14,000 transformants. Ninety-eight transformants were CPY-positive, indicating that many of this type of mutant PrA precursors can form active PrA. One CPY-positive transformant was chosen from each pool and plasmid DNA was isolated and introduced into E. coli. From the E. coli transformants, plasmid DNA was isolated for retransformation of yeast and for DNA sequencing. All isolated plasmids (termed pBVH1201, 1218, 1318, and 1320-1336) gave a CPY-positive phenotype upon retransformation of W3122. Sequencing of the mutated part of the prosequences showed that all 20 constructs had the expected restriction sites and the expected length and were all different (Fig. 2). Interestingly, 18 of these 20 mutant propeptides contained a positively charged amino acid (lysine or arginine) at the most N-terminal randomized position, position 53. Residue 53 is a lysine in the wild-type precursor. These data suggest that this positive charge is important for correct biosynthesis of the PrA precursor. At position 54 in the active constructs, 7 histidines, 5 arginines, 5 threonines, 2 tyrosines, and 1 valine were found, deviating significantly from a random distribution. The wild-type precursor has a tyrosine at this position. We see no other obvious sequence similarities between the active constructs. Pilot transformations of W3122 with a few plasmid pools of the N-half in cis collection showed that the frequency of CPY-positive transformants was substantially lower than had been found for the C-half in cis collection. To be able to find the most active mutants in this collection, we transformed the Δpep4 PRB1 strain W3094 with the pools and varied the incubation temperature. More CPY-positive transformants were found on plates that had been incubated at 23°C than on ones that had been at 30°C. Twenty-two pools gave one or more CPY-positive transformants at 23°C. One CPY-positive transformant was chosen from each pool and plasmid DNA was isolated and introduced into E. coli. Plasmid DNA isolated from the E. coli transformants was used for retransformation of yeast and for DNA sequencing. Nineteen isolated plasmids complemented the CPY-negative phenotype upon retransformation of W3094. Sequencing showed that 16 of the prosequences had the expected restriction sites and the expected length (Fig. 3). Of the three other constructs, one (pBVH1651) lacked two of the random codons, while two others, pBVH1650 and pBVH1667, resulted from odd ligations at the XhoI restriction site. We could see no clear primary sequence similarities between the 19 active constructs. Secondary structure predictions according to Rost and Sander (26Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar, 27Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar) were made for the mutant propeptides, but no clear similarity between the predicted structures was seen. Interestingly, four of the mutant prosequences contained an acceptor site for N-linked glycosylation (Asn- X-Thr). In order to determine the frequency of functional propeptides more precisely, it was important to find out how many of the plasmids in the collections indeed produced a full-length PrA form, i.e. did not contain a stop codon or other mutations in the open reading frame preventing production of PrA. Sequencing of some randomly chosen constructs indicated that the DNA synthesizer had generated some oligonucleotides in which one or more positions in the sequence had been skipped. Thus, many of the plasmids from the two in cis collections (about 50-60%) did not produce PrA because of frameshift mutations. Taking this into consideration, we conclude that about 1.6% (98/(0.45 × 14,000)) of all mutant precursors with a randomized C-terminal half of the propeptide can form enough active PrA to allow complementation of the CPY-negative phenotype of the Δpep4 prb1 strain (W3122). Ten plasmids that encoded a PrA polypeptide but did not complement the CPY-negative phenotype of W3122 were sequenced in the randomized area to verify that the oligonucleotide-derived sequences were indeed random (Fig. 2). This showed that there was no general overrepresentation neither of positively charged residues at position 53, nor of His, Arg, or Thr at position 54. For the N-half in cis collection, we conclude that around 0.5% (19/(0.45 × 6500)) of all mutant precursors with a randomized N-terminal half of the propeptide can form enough active PrA to complement the CPY-negative phenotype of a Δpep4 strain at 23°C. Six plasmids of this collection that produced PrA but did not complement the CPY-negative phenotype of W3094 at 23°C were sequenced in the oligonucleotide-derived area (Fig. 3). Pools of plasmids from the in cis collections were introduced into strain JHRY20-2C- Δpep4, which produces a truncated PrA form including the entire propeptide. This was done to test whether the randomized mutant precursors could interact with an in tr"
https://openalex.org/W2027997825,"To elucidate the electrical events associated with the movement of amino acids by the neutral and basic amino acid transporter (NBAT)-encoded protein (Yan, N., Mosckovitz, R., Gerber, L. D., Mathew, S., Murty, V. V. V. S., Tate, S. S., and Udenfriend, S. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 7548-7552), we have investigated the membrane potential and current changes associated with the increased transport of amino acids across the cell membrane of NBAT cRNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes. Superfusion of 0.05 m ML-phenylalanine, in current-clamped NBAT-injected oocytes, caused a hyperpolarization (8.5 ± 0.9 mV), but superfusion of L-arginine caused a depolarization (18.3 ± 1.3 mV). In voltage-clamped (−60 mV) oocytes, superfusion of L-phenylalanine evoked a sodium- and chloride-independent, saturable (Km = 0.34 ± 0.02 m M, Imax = 31.3 ± 0.5 nA), outward current. This outward current was reduced in the presence of high external [K] and was barium-sensitive. Outward currents were also evoked by L-leucine, L-glutamine, L-alanine, D-phenylalanine, and L-β-phenylalanine. Superfusion of L-arginine evoked a saturable (Km = 0.09 ± 0.02 m M, Imax = −29.2 ± 1.3 nA) inward current; L-lysine and D-arginine also evoked inward currents. L-Glutamate and β-alanine failed to evoke any currents. Effluxes of L-[3H]phenylalanine and L-[3H]arginine were trans-stimulated in the presence of either amino acid. Flux-current comparisons indicated amino acid:charge movement stoichiometry of 1:1 for both neutral and cationic amino acids. These findings indicate that the amino acid transport activity(ies) expressed in NBAT cRNA-injected oocytes is electrogenic by a mechanism including the outward movement of a net positive charge (potassium ion or cationic amino acid) in exchange for uptake of a neutral amino acid. To elucidate the electrical events associated with the movement of amino acids by the neutral and basic amino acid transporter (NBAT)-encoded protein (Yan, N., Mosckovitz, R., Gerber, L. D., Mathew, S., Murty, V. V. V. S., Tate, S. S., and Udenfriend, S. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Superfusion of 0.05 m ML-phenylalanine, in current-clamped NBAT-injected oocytes, caused a hyperpolarization (8.5 ± 0.9 mV), but superfusion of L-arginine caused a depolarization (18.3 ± 1.3 mV). In voltage-clamped (−60 mV) oocytes, superfusion of L-phenylalanine evoked a sodium- and chloride-independent, saturable (Km = 0.34 ± 0.02 m M, Imax = 31.3 ± 0.5 nA), outward current. This outward current was reduced in the presence of high external [K] and was barium-sensitive. Outward currents were also evoked by L-leucine, L-glutamine, L-alanine, D-phenylalanine, and L-β-phenylalanine. Superfusion of L-arginine evoked a saturable (Km = 0.09 ± 0.02 m M, Imax = −29.2 ± 1.3 nA) inward current; L-lysine and D-arginine also evoked inward currents. L-Glutamate and β-alanine failed to evoke any currents. Effluxes of L-[3H]phenylalanine and L-[3H]arginine were trans-stimulated in the presence of either amino acid. Flux-current comparisons indicated amino acid:charge movement stoichiometry of 1:1 for both neutral and cationic amino acids. These findings indicate that the amino acid transport activity(ies) expressed in NBAT cRNA-injected oocytes is electrogenic by a mechanism including the outward movement of a net positive charge (potassium ion or cationic amino acid) in exchange for uptake of a neutral amino acid. Transporter proteins located in the membranes of epithelial cells play a vital role in absorption of amino acids from the lumen of renal tubules and small intestine to the blood (1Christensen H.N.

We hypothesized that measurable inward currents would be generated in response to the movement of cationic amino acids in NBAT-expressing oocytes. We therefore examined the mechanisms of amino acid transport in NBAT-expressing oocytes using a combination of two-electrode voltage-clamp and radiotracer methodology. Our initial hypothesis proved to be correct, as we report here, but to our surprise we also found that outward currents were generated in response to the superfusion of neutral amino acids. We further hypothesized that this outward current would be (i) saturable and voltage-dependent and (ii) due to either the inward movement of an anion or an outward movement of a cation species. We discuss the evidence for the operation in NBAT-expressing oocytes of a novel sodium- and chloride-independent but potassium-linked transport mechanism which involves outward movement of a positive charge associated with inward transport of neutral amino acids. During the preparation of this manuscript Busch et al. (8Busch A.E. Herzer T. Waldegger S. Schmidt F. Palacin M. Biber J. Markovich D. Murer H. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25581-25586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported on the electrogenic properties of rBAT protein (a rabbit glycoprotein with 80% predicted amino acid sequence homology to NBAT) in Xenopus oocytes. These authors found consequent to rBAT expression, inward and outward currents bearing some similarity to those described here, but not linked to outward movement of potassium as we discovered. The similarities and differences between the currents evoked by NBAT- and rBAT-expressing oocytes raise important questions which we discuss here. The cDNA clone for NBAT was a kind gift of Dr. S. Udenfriend, Roche Research Center, Nutley, NJ. Synthetic cRNA was transcribed in vitro (transcription kit from Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) from NBAT cDNA clone (in pSPORT 1 plasmid vector) (9Tate S. Yan N. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and 5 ng of cRNA in 50 nl of sterile water were injected into each defolliculated stage VI X. laevis oocyte. All experiments were performed 3-5 days post cRNA injection. Resting membrane potential in current-clamped mode and amino acid-evoked membrane currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage-clamp recording system (GeneClamp 500, Axon Instrs., Inc., Foster City, CA). Only oocytes with resting membrane potential > −40 mV were used in this study. For electrophysiological studies, oocytes were superfused with a medium containing either 100 m M NaCl, tetramethylammonium (TMA) chloride, or sodium isethionate and including 2 m M KCl, 1 m M CaCl2, 1 m M MgCl2, and 10 m M HEPES pH 7.5 with Tris-base (superfusion medium). Amino acids at the indicated concentrations were added to this solution. The temperature of the superfusion medium was controlled at 22 ± 1°C. The potential-recording and current-passing electrodes were filled with 1 M KCl. For experiments in which the chloride was replaced with isethionate, the bath probe was isolated from the superfusing solution using a 3 M KCl/agar bridge. Holding potential (Vh was normally maintained at −60 ± 1 mV in voltage-clamp experiments. Recordings of the membrane current and potential were displayed on a chart recorder. [K]i in oocytes was measured by standard flame photometric methods. Amino acid fluxes were measured using 3H-labeled L-phenylalanine and L-arginine (Amersham Corp., UK) as tracers; amino acid influx to oocytes was assessed as described previously (9Tate S. Yan N. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and efflux was estimated (by a method described elsewhere (10Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Kim J.W. Cunningham J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7538-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) from the appearance in the medium (over successive 15-min periods) of tracer injected into oocytes (0.1 kBq per oocyte in 50 nl of sterile water). Measurements were made in 3-10 individual oocytes (from three or more separate batches in most cases) for each experimental maneuver unless otherwise stated. Data were averaged from oocytes tested and are expressed as means ± S.E. Transport and flame photometry data are expressed as means ± S.E. for experiments performed on three to seven oocyte batches (10 individual oocytes per batch). Analysis of variance tests were performed where appropriate. Superfusion of L-phenylalanine (0.05 m M in TMA chloride medium) in current-clamped NBAT-injected oocytes (resting membrane potential −59.4 ± 5 mV) caused a hyperpolarization (8.5 ± 0.9 mV) of the oocyte cell membrane, whereas L-arginine (0.05 m M) caused a depolarization (18.3 ± 1.3 mV). There was no detectable change in the membrane potential of control (water-injected) oocytes (−63 ± 3 mV) in response to superfusion of either L-phenylalanine or L-arginine (tested between 0.05 and 1 m M). Superfusion of NBAT-injected Xenopus oocytes, clamped at a Vh of −60 mV, with L-phenylalanine in 100 m M NaCl or TMA chloride superfusion medium evoked similar reversible outward currents (IPhe) (Table I and Fig. 1A). Under similar conditions superfusion of L-arginine evoked a reversible inward current (IArg) which was also sodium-independent (Table I and Fig. 1B). Both IPhe and IArg were also chloride-independent since currents of equivalent magnitude were evoked in 100 m M NaCl or equimolar sodium isethionate medium (Table I). L-Phenylalanine and L-arginine evoked currents were saturable and exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics; at a Vh of −60 mV for one representative batch of oocytes the Km (m M) was 0.34 ± 0.02 and 0.09 ± 0.02 and Imax (nA) was 31.3 ± 0.5 and −29.2 ± 1.3 for L-phenylalanine and L-arginine, respectively (values are means ± S.E. where S.E. represents the error of the line fitted to a Hane's transformation of data at six different amino acid concentrations (0.05-1 m M) with n = 3 oocytes at each concentration). Similar values were obtained in a separate batch of oocytes. Outward currents were also observed for other neutral amino acids, e.g. L-glutamine, L-alanine, and L-β-phenylalanine (Table II). Superfusion of the D-isomers of phenylalanine and arginine also induced outward and inward currents, respectively (Table II). The magnitudes of IPhe and IArg were dependent upon Vh at values between −40 and −100 mV (Fig. 2). The null potential for L-phenylalanine-induced current occurred between −100 and −110 mV.Table I:Ion dependence of L-phenylalanine and L-arginine currents in voltage-clamped (−60 mV) NBAT-expressing oocytesValues are means ± S.E. for 3-10 oocytes for each measurement.

A small inward current (≈0.3-1.0 nA) was observed in control water injected oocytes for both L-phenylalanine and L-arginine. Injection of oocytes with NBAT cRNA resulted in increased uptake of a range of neutral and cationic amino acids (including L-arginine, L-lysine, L-phenylalanine, L-alanine, and L-glutamine) as reported previously (3Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 9Tate S. Yan N. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The increased uptake of both L-phenylalanine and L-arginine tracers (0.05 m M) by NBAT-injected oocytes was sodium-independent, saturable, and inhibited by D-leucine (Fig. 3 A). The stoichiometry of L-phenylalanine:charge movement (Table III) was calculated by converting the current evoked by 0.05 m M phenylalanine to a charge flux using Faraday's constant (F = 9.65 × 104C˙mol−1). Superfusion of 0.05 m ML-phenylalanine caused a shift of ∼10 mV in current-clamped oocytes (see above), therefore the outward current value used in this calculation was at a Vh of −70 mV. This calculated charge flux represents a stoichiometry for L-phenylalanine:charge movement of 1:1 (Table III). The equivalent calculation for the inward arginine evoked current (at a Vh of −40 mV) also represents a stoichiometry for L-arginine:charge movement of 1:1 (Table III).Table III:Charge: flux ratios for amino acid (AA) transport activity in NBAT-expressing oocytesTable III:Charge: flux ratios for amino acid (AA) transport activity in NBAT-expressing oocytes The identity of the ratios for transport:charge movement during increased flux of both L-phenylalanine and L-arginine in NBAT cRNA-injected oocytes raised the possibility that the transport activities expressed in these oocytes could be the manifestation of a neutral-cationic amino acid (e.g. phenylalanine-arginine) exchanger. If this were the case, then the two amino acids should exhibit reciprocal trans-stimulation of transport, as indeed proved to be the case when this was tested (Fig. 3 B): effluxes of both L-[3H]arginine and L-[3H]phenylalanine were trans-stimulated by addition of either amino acid on the trans (external) side of the oocyte membrane (Fig. 3 B). Arginine tracer efflux was 0.34 ± 0.05% min−1 at an external phenylalanine concentration of 0.05 m M. Assuming a single, exchangeable oocyte pool of the major cationic amino acids (175 pmol of arginine + lysine per oocyte) (11Taylor M.A. Smith D. Dev. Biol. 1987; 124: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the tracer efflux represents 175 × 0.0034 = 0.59 pmol/oocyte˙min. This rate is less than 15% of the measured phenylalanine influx and could carry only an equivalent proportion of the associated outward current, thus indicating that movement of other cations must be responsible for the major part of the phenylalanine-evoked current. Under normal experimental conditions the potassium cation has an outwardly directed electrochemical gradient (since [K]i) = 89 ± 2 m M in NBAT cRNA injected oocytes (and 88 ± 3 m M in H2O injected oocytes) n = 5 oocytes, compared to [K]o = 2 m M). We tested the hypothesis that the outward IPhe might also be due to an outward movement of potassium. Increasing the [K]o from 2 to 10 m M (and thus reducing the outward potassium gradient) in TMA chloride superfusion medium reduced the magnitude of IPhe by more than 50% (Fig. 4) in NBAT-expressing oocytes voltage clamped at a Vh of −60 mV; decreasing the [K]o from 2 to 1 m M increased the magnitude of IPhe (Fig. 4). We also found that the L-phenylalanine-evoked current was barium-sensitive since the addition of 1 m M BaCl2in the superfusion medium during superfusion with 0.2 m ML-phenylalanine reduced the IPhe to ≈60% of its value in the absence of BaCl2(15.0 ± 1.4 versus 9.5 ± 0.8 nA, n = 5 oocytes, p < 0.025). We have demonstrated electrogenic properties of both neutral and cationic amino acid transport in NBAT-expressing oocytes. The primary aim of this study was to elucidate the membrane currents associated with the transport of cationic amino acids in NBAT-expressing oocytes, and as expected the influx of the cationic amino acid arginine produced an inward membrane current consistent with 1 arginine ion:1 charge movement stoichiometry; other cationic amino acids also evoked inward currents. However, we also found that the uptake of neutral (uncharged) amino acids (notably L-phenylalanine, L-glutamine, and L-β-phenylalanine) in these oocytes also produced current with 1 phenylalanine:1 charge movement stoichiometry but that this current was in the opposite direction to that observed with the cationic amino acids. Both IArg and IPhe were voltage-dependent and sodium- and chloride-independent which for IPhe indicates outward movement of a positive charge. These results are broadly consistent with the recently published report for the amino acid induced currents in rBAT-expressing oocytes (8Busch A.E. Herzer T. Waldegger S. Schmidt F. Palacin M. Biber J. Markovich D. Murer H. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25581-25586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phenylalanine:cationic amino acid exchange may account for a minor portion (≈15%) of phenylalanine transport but there appears to be an additional (perhaps major) component of phenylalanine uptake associated with the outward movement of another cation (most likely potassium). This idea is consistent with the identification of at least two kinetically distinct (high and low affinity) components of neutral amino acid (L-leucine) uptake induced in rBAT (12Van Winkle L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) - and NBAT 2A. Ahmed, G. J. Peter, P. M. Taylor, A. A. Harper, and M. J. Rennie, unpublished data. -expressing oocytes. The suggested involvement of potassium is based on the following observations. (i) The null potential for IPhe, calculated from Fig. 2, was −106 mV, a value close to the potassium equilibrium potential in oocytes of −99 mV (where [K]i) is 89 m M) and (ii) the magnitude of IPhe was reduced as a result of decreased transmembrane potassium gradient. Moreover the potassium conductance inhibitor barium significantly inhibits the IPhe. All this evidence indicates that a component of the phenylalanine-induced outward current is linked to the outward movement of potassium which is barium-sensitive. Most neutral amino acids (both L- and D-isomers) tested induced an outward current in NBAT-expressing oocytes, although β-alanine and the anionic L-glutamate failed to evoke any current. The acceptance of certain D-amino acids as substrates by the induced transport activities of NBAT/D2-expressing oocytes has been reported previously (3Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) (also shown here both by evoked currents and by inhibition of transport with D-leucine) and confirms both the poor stereospecificity and the limited tolerance of the β-amino group of the activated/expressed protein. It has been suggested that NBAT protein promotes the uptake of neutral and cationic amino acids by a single transport activity (system b0, +) (6Van Winkle L.J. Campione A.L. Gorman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3150-3163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in Xenopus oocytes (2Yan N. Mosckovitz R. Gerber L.D. Mathew S. Murty V.V.V.S. Tate S.S. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7548-7552Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Amino acid transport by a system b0, + like transporter has been previously reported in Xenopus oocytes using radiotracer methodology (3Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) but in our experiments the outward currents detected for L-phenylalanine or other neutral amino acids in NBAT-expressing oocytes were not detected in control water injected oocytes, indicating that the major native and expressed system b0, + like transport activities may be distinct from one another. The molecular architecture of the NBAT/D2 protein, which appears to have only one membrane-spanning region (unlike 8-14 for conventional amino acid transporters) (3Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and the presence of a leucine zipper motif at its C terminus, raises the possibility that the protein may not necessarily be a transporter in its own right but is instead associated with a second catalytic (i.e. transporting) subunit (12Van Winkle L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, Veyhl et al. (13Veyhl M. Spangenberg J. Puschel B. Poppe R. Dekel C. Fritzsch G. Haase W. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25041-25053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported the cloning of RS1, a 66-kDa membrane-associated protein with a single transmembrane domain which activates sodium- D-glucose cotransport by SGLT1 when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes. It is therefore conceivable that NBAT cDNA encodes for an analogous protein which stimulates the activity of amino acid transporters native to Xenopus oocytes. An alternative possibility is that NBAT encodes for a protein acting as an amino acid-activated pore conductance which allows the movement of cations (such as potassium and arginine) in conjunction with a wide variety of neutral amino acids. The growing evidence that a multicomponent mechanism for neutral amino acid transport is induced in NBAT cRNA injected oocytes may indicate that the expression of system b0, +-like transport reflects the activity of more than a single protein product. Neutral amino acids evoke sodium- and chloride-independent outward currents in oocytes expressing NBAT (present study) and rBAT protein (as demonstrated by Busch et al. (8Busch A.E. Herzer T. Waldegger S. Schmidt F. Palacin M. Biber J. Markovich D. Murer H. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25581-25586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Our results are also consistent with that of Busch et al. (8Busch A.E. Herzer T. Waldegger S. Schmidt F. Palacin M. Biber J. Markovich D. Murer H. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25581-25586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in so far as both studies show that neutral amino acids are transported in oocytes by obligatory exchange with a cation. The two studies differ in the fact that we demonstrate directly, that only a minor portion of the transport mechanism involves neutral:cationic amino acid exchange, since the associated charge movements cannot account for the evoked currents (at least in the case of NBAT-expressing oocytes). Furthermore, our experimental evidence is consistent with the notion that potassium is a major cation involved, although other small intracellular cations (inorganic or organic) may also play a role in exchange. In marked contrast there is no evidence for the involvement of potassium in rBAT-induced neutral amino acid transport, even though there is 80% homology between the predicted amino acid sequences of NBAT (9Tate S. Yan N. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and rBAT (4Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A. Palacin M. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5601-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The evidence of the involvement of potassium in the transport of neutral amino acids in NBAT-expressing oocytes (as presented in this study) and the lack of it in rBAT-expressing oocytes (8Busch A.E.

Epithelial tissues (e.g. kidney and small intestine) are the major sites for the expression of NBAT/rBAT-type (4Bertran J. Werner A. Moore M.L. Stange G. Markovich D. Biber J. Testar X. Zorzano A.

In renal and intestinal epithelia the ability of transport processes to exchange neutral for cationic amino acids may, for example, provide a useful contribution to the processes by which absorbed arginine, lysine, and ornithine are released into the blood, perhaps in exchange for amino acids of nutritional importance to the epithelial cells such as glutamine (a substrate for the NBAT-encoded protein). NBAT protein is also expressed in neural tissue (2Yan N. Mosckovitz R. Gerber L.D. Mathew S. Murty V.V.V.S. Tate S.S. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previous protein-DNA binding studies have shown that HS-40 consists of multiple nuclear factor binding motifs that are occupied in vivo in an erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific manner. We have systematically analyzed the functional roles of these factor binding motifs of HS-40 by site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression assay in erythroid cell cultures. Three of these HS-40 enhancer motifs, 5′NF-E2/AP1, GT II, and GATA-1(c), positively regulate the ζ2-globin promoter activity in embryonic/fetal erythroid K562 cells and the adult α-globin promoter activity in adult erythroid MEL cells. On the other hand, the 3′NF-E2/AP1 motif is able to exert both positive and negative regulatory effects on the ζ2-globin promoter activity in K562 cells, and this dual function appears to be modulated through differential binding of the ubiquitous AP1 factors and the erythroid-enriched NF-E2 factor. Mutation in the GATA-1(d) motif, which exhibits an adult erythroid-specific genomic footprint, decreases the HS-40 enhancer function in dimethyl sulfoxide-induced MEL cells but not in K562 cells. These studies have defined the regulatory roles of the different HS-40 motifs.

The human α-like globin gene family is clustered on chromosome 16. The transcriptionally active members of the gene cluster are arranged in the order of their expression during erythroid development: 5′-ζ2 (embryonic)-α2 (fetal/adult)-α1 (fetal/adult)-θ1 (fetal/adult, minor)-3′ (Higgs et al., 1989Higgs D.R. Vickers M.A. Wilkie A.O.M. Pretorius I.M. Jarman A.P. Weatherall D.J. Blood. 1989; 73: 1081-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of these members, ζ2 is transcribed predominantly in yolk sac, the embryonic erythroid tissue. As development proceeds, the expression of ζ2 is shut off, and the two α-globin genes, α2 and α1, are turned on in fetal liver. Finally, in adult humans, the two α-globin genes are expressed at high levels in nucleated erythroblasts originated from appropriate stem cells in the bone marrow. In the adult and fetal erythroblasts, however, low levels of ζ2 and θ1 messages could still be detected (Albitar et al., 1989Albitar M. Peschle C. Liebhaber S.A. Blood. 1989; 74: 629-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Chui et al., 1989Chui P.H.K. Mentzer W.C. Patterson M. Larocci T.A. Embury S.H. Perrine S.P. Mibashan R.S. Higgs D.R. Blood. 1989; 74: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of these α-like globin genes, similar to the β-like globin family members, is regulated predominantly at the level of transcription (Collins and Weissman, 1984Collins F.S.

The α-LCR is located at approximately 40 kilobase pairs upstream of the ζ2-globin gene, and its functional domain has been mapped, by transgenic mice and DNA transfection studies, to a 300-bp sequence containing an erythroid-specific DNase I-hypersensitive site (HS-40). Similar to the regulation of the β-like globin genes by β-LCR, the α-LCR or HS-40 confers high levels of erythroid-specific expression of linked human ζ2- or α-globin genes in transgenic mice or stably integrated cell lines (Jarman et al., 1991Jarman A.P.

The molecular mechanisms of how the α-LCR controls ζ2- or α-globin gene transcription are not well understood.

Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 304-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the α-LCR could play a dominant role in the formation of an active chromatin structure of the entire α-like globin locus domain. It could also, like other eukaryotic gene enhancers, facilitate the assembly of active transcriptional initiation complexes at the ζ2- or α-globin upstream promoters. All of these regulatory processes are likely to be modulated by diffusible nuclear factors, as suggested by previous chromosome transfer and cell fusion experiments (Deisseroth and Hendrick, 1979Deisseroth A. Hendrick D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar; Baron and Maniatis, 1986Baron M.H. Maniatis T. Cell. 1986; 46: 591-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A number of nuclear factors bind in vitro to several different sequence motifs of the α-LCR (Jarman et al., 1991Jarman A.P. Wood W.G. Sharpe J. Gourdon G. Ayyub H. Higgs D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4679-4689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Strauss et al., 1992Strauss E.C. Andrews N.C. Higgs D.R. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2135-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent genomic footprinting work has demonstrated the formation in vivo of specific nuclear factor-DNA complexes at a subset of these sequence motifs in erythroid cells (Strauss et al., 1992Strauss E.C. Andrews N.C. Higgs D.R. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2135-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a single set of nuclear factor binding motifs is found in the α-LCR as well as in the β-LCR (Fig. 1 A). These motifs include GATA-1, which binds a factor specifically expressed in erythroid, megakaryotic, and mast cell lineages (Martin et al., 1990Martin D.I. Zon L.I. Mutter G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1990; 344: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar; Romeo et al., 1990Romeo P.H. Prandini M.H. Joulin V. Mignotte V. Prenant M. Vainchenker W. Marguerie G. Uzan G.

Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar); and the GT motif, which binds Sp1, USF, or TEF (Jarman et al., 1991Jarman A.P. Wood W.G. Sharpe J. Gourdon G. Ayyub H. Higgs D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4679-4689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Ellis et al., 1993Ellis J. Talbot D. Dillon N. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 129-134Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The functional contributions of these nuclear factor binding motifs to the enhancement of human embryonic ζ2-globin promoter activity by HS-40 have been partially analyzed before (Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results suggested that one of the four GATA-1 motifs, GATA-1(c) (Fig. 1), and both NF-E2/AP1 motifs played positive regulatory roles (Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mutant HS-40 sequences used in the above study were generated mainly by Bal31 deletion, which could remove more than one functional motif during successive deletion steps. This would have prohibited the definitive assignment of the positive/negative role of a particular motif. Furthermore, the previous analysis was carried out only with transfected K562 cells, a human erythroid cell line of embryonic/fetal origins (Lozzio and Lozzio, 1975Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it did not allow us to assess the functional significance of the developmental stage-specific difference of nuclear factor binding patterns within HS-40, as seen in previous genomic footprinting analysis of HS-40 in adult versus embryonic/fetal erythroid cells (Strauss et al., 1992Strauss E.C. Andrews N.C. Higgs D.R. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2135-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To gain further insights into the functions of the multiple nuclear factor-DNA complexes of HS-40, we have generated various HS-40 mutants by site-directed mutagenesis. The activity of either the embryonic ζ2- or the adult α-globin gene promoter cis-linked to these HS-40 mutants was then assayed after transient expression in K562 cells and in MEL, a mouse adult erythroid cell line (Friend et al., 1971Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). As shown below, the present study has clearly defined the positive/negative roles of different HS-40 DNA motifs, including a dual role of the 3′ NF-E2/AP1 motif. The functionality of these motifs also correlates remarkably well with their erythroid lineage- and developmental stage-specific occupancies by nuclear factors in vivo. We first constructed pBlue-HS-40 by blunt end ligation of a 373-bp EcoRI- BamHI fragment containing the HS-40 enhancer (Higgs et al., 1990Higgs D.R. Wood W.G. Jarman A.P. Sharpe J. Lida J. Pretorius I.-M. Ayyub H. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1588-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of pBluescript II KS(-). Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using a commercially available kit, Mutator™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Different oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized so that they were homologous to specific target regions in the wild type enhancer but with one or more base mismatches in the core binding sites for different nuclear factors. Many of them also contained specific restriction enzyme sites in order to facilitate the identification of the mutants. HS-40 mutations were first introduced into the plasmid pBlue-HS-40. The wild type and different HS-40 mutant-containing fragments were then isolated from agarose gels after XbaI digestion of pBlue-HS-40 or the above pBlue-HS-40-based plasmids and cloned into the XbaI site of p-ζ597GH (Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains 597 bp of the ζ2-globin promoter region (−559 to +38) linked to the human growth hormone reporter gene in p0GH (Nichols Institute). Each of the enhancer fragments was also cloned, by blunt end ligation, into the HindIII site of pB-α590GH, which contains a 590-bp HindIII- DdeI fragment of the human α-globin promoter (−574 to +21) located immediately upstream of the human growth hormone gene of p0GH. Only plasmids containing HS-40 in the genomic orientation relative to the globin promoters were used in the transfection assay. All mutant plasmids were identified by restriction enzyme cutting and dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Corresponding to the lower strand of HS-40, the mutant oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis of the HS-40 enhancer are: GATA-1(b), 5′-GTTGGCCCAGaatTCTGCTCCCTCAAGT-3′; 5′NF-E2/AP1, 5′-CAGAAGCACTGAtcgATGGTTGGCCCAG-3′; 3′(NF-E2/AP1)-I, 5′-CCCCCACAGGATcga-TCAGCAGTCCTGT-3′; 3′(NF-E2/AP1)-II, 5′-CCCCCACAGGATGACTCAGaAGTCCTGT-3′; GT II, 5′-CCCACCTCCACgtgCACAGGATGACTC-3′; GATA-1(c), 5′-GCACCAGAGGTTGaatTCAGCAGTACCA-3′; GATA-1(d), 5′-CTTCCCTCTCAGgTtAACAGGAGGGGGA-3′. The plasmids containing different site-directed mutants are named according to the following examples. The plasmids containing the wild type HS-40 are pHS-40-ζ597GH and pHS-40-B-α590GH; the plasmids containing a mutation in the 5′NF-E2/AP1 motif of HS-40 are pHS-40 (5′NF-E2/AP1)-ζ597GH and pB-HS-40 (5′NF-E2/AP1)-α590GH, etc. The maintenance of the erythroid K562 and MEL cells in culture is as described (Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Reddy and Shen, 1993Reddy S.P.M. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). DNA transfection was accomplished by electroporation (Potter et al., 1984Potter H. Weir L. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7161-7165Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Procedures for transfection of K562 cells are similar to those previously described (Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that the cells were harvested at the densities of 5-8 × 106cells/ml. It was observed that the lower densities of cells at harvesting prior to the electroporation gave more reproducible data of transient expression. For transient expression in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-induced MEL, the cells growing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin were harvested at the densities of 1-5 × 106cells/ml. A total of 107cells was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.4 ml of medium containing 10 μg of the test plasmid(s), 1 μg of pSV2CAT (Gorman et al., 1982Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar), and 50 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA. After electroporation, the cells were grown in media with 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 2% Me2SO for 5 days, with 1:1 dilution on the 3rd day. The relatively low levels of globin promoter activities from enhancerless plasmids were measured by the sensitive human growth hormone (GH) assay (Selden et al., 1986Selden R.F. Burke-howie K. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The level of HS-40-directed ζ2-globin promoter activities in K562 cells and HS-40-directed α-globin promoter activities in Me2SO-induced MEL cells were measured by the GH assay and/or RNA primer extension (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), which gave comparable results. Data from either GH assay or RNA primer extension analysis were calibrated against the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities expressed from co-transfected pSV2CAT plasmids (Gorman et al., 1982Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar), although the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities usually were constant within the range of ±10%. The quantities of the endogenous ζ2 mRNAs were also used to standardize the expression levels of transfected plasmids. The average expression level for each plasmid was derived from three or more independent DNA transfection experiments. The details of the above GH assay, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, and RNA primer extension analysis are as described previously (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HS-40 enhancer consists of a total of four GATA-1 motifs, two NF-E2/AP1 motifs, and one GT motif, as defined by nuclear factor binding studies in vitro (Jarman et al., 1991Jarman A.P. Wood W.G. Sharpe J. Gourdon G. Ayyub H. Higgs D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4679-4689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Strauss et al., 1992Strauss E.C. Andrews N.C. Higgs D.R. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2135-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Except for GATA-1(a), which exhibited no genomic footprint and was apparently non-functional in previous Bal31 deletion analysis (Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have introduced 2- or 3-bp substitutions into each of the above mentioned motifs (Fig. 1 B). The enhancer effects of these HS-40 mutants on the ζ2-globin promoter activity in K562 cells and on the α-globin promoter activity in Me2SO-induced MEL cells were then measured by transient expression assay. Under our experimental conditions, the wild type HS-40 enhances the activity of cis-linked embryonic ζ2-globin promoter in K562 cells by 160 ± 15-fold and that of cis-linked adult α-globin promoter in Me2SO-induced MEL cells by 13 ± 2-fold. As exemplified by the primer extension analysis in Fig. 2 and summarized in Fig. 3 the enhancer function of HS-40 on ζ2-globin promoter activity in K562 cells was not affected by mutations either in the GATA-1(b) motif (Fig. 2 A, lane 1), which is consistent with our previous result (Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or in the GATA-1(d) motif (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). However, the HS-40 enhancer function dropped by 40% when the GATA-1(c) motif was mutated (Fig. 2 A, lane 5).FIG. 3Summary of functional roles of individual nuclear factor binding motifs of HS-40 enhancer. The motifs in the 355-bp enhancer are labeled as described in Fig. 1 A except for GATA-1(d), which is half-filled to indicate its occupancy by nuclear factors, presumably GATA-1, in adult erythroid cells but not in embryonic/fetal erythroid cells. The small x in the lines below the top diagram indicates the individual motifs changed by site-directed mutagenesis. The enhancer effects of wild type and mutant HS-40 sequences on the ζ2-globin promoter activity in K562 cells and on the α-globin promoter in Me2SO-induced MEL cells were analyzed by transient expression assay. The relative enhancer strengths, with the wild type (WT) HS-40 being 100%, were calculated from RNA primer extension and GH assay data as described in the text and are listed. The standard deviations, as derived from two to four independent transfection experiments, are listed in the parentheses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutation of either 5′NF-E2/AP1 or GT II motif essentially abolished the enhancer function of HS-40 in K562 cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 4). Surprisingly, mutant HS-40 with the 1-bp mutation in the 3′NF-E2/AP1 motif, 3′(NF-E2/AP1)-II (Fig. 1 B), exhibited a 2-3-fold higher level of enhancer activity than the wild type (Fig. 2 A, lane 3 and Fig. 2 B, lane 2). This is in contrast to the previous observation of similar base mutation in a dimeric NF-E2/AP1 motif, which greatly repressed the enhancer function of 5′HS2 or β-LCR (see “Discussion”). On the other hand, the 3-bp mutation of 3′NF-E2/AP1 motif, 3′(NF-E2/AP1)-I (Fig. 1 B), greatly decreased the HS-40 enhancer function by 75% (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). As summarized in Fig. 3, all mutations introduced into HS-40 greatly decreased its enhancer effect on the α-globin promoter activity in Me2SO-induced MEL cells. Interestingly, the increase of HS-40 enhancer function in K562 cells due to the 3′NF-E2/AP1-II mutation was not observed in MEL cells. Also, mutation of the GATA-1(d) motif, which is genomic footprinted only in the adult erythroid environment (Strauss et al., 1992Strauss E.C. Andrews N.C. Higgs D.R. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2135-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), decreased the HS-40 enhancer function in MEL cells by 60%. For the first time, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to systematically analyze the functional roles of different nuclear factor-DNA complexes of HS-40 in the transcriptional activation of human α-like globin upstream promoters by the α-LCR in erythroid cells at different developmental stages. Since only transient expression assay has been used, our data most likely reflect the structure-function relationship during the final stage of transcriptional activation when the globin promoters are presumably physically associated with the HS-40 enhancer. Our primary targets for site-directed mutagenesis of HS-40 are those sequence motifs that bind specific nuclear factors in vitro and/or in vivo (Fig. 1). Despite the fact that genomic footprints most likely reflect only relatively stable binding of proteins to DNA helix and that nuclear factor(s) functioning at an earlier stage of human α-like globin gene regulation may remain bound to its cognate DNA sequence(s), our data have demonstrated a remarkable correlation between the erythroid-specific occupancy of specific nuclear factor binding motifs at the HS-40 enhancer and their regulatory roles in the transcriptional activation of the human α-like globin promoters in transiently transfected erythroid cell cultures. Several previous studies have analyzed the function of the single GATA-1 motif in the 5′HS-2 enhancer of β-LCR. Mutation in the GATA-1 motif of a synthetic core 5′HS-2 fragment showed no effect on the level of expression of a linked human globin gene in multicopy transgenic mice (Ellis et al., 1993Ellis J. Talbot D. Dillon N. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 129-134Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The same construct exhibited a 40% reduction of β-globin gene expression in stably integrated MEL cells (Ellis et al., 1993Ellis J. Talbot D. Dillon N. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 129-134Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mutation of the same GATA-1 motif in a native 5′HS-2 environment, however, did not affect the expression of a cis-linked γ-globin promoter when stably integrated in K562 cells as a single copy (Miller et al., 1993Miller J.L. Walsh C.E. Ney P.A. Samulski R.J. Nienhuis A.W. Blood. 1993; 82: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, GATA-1 mutation showed no effect on the 5′HS-2 enhancer function on ε-globin promoter in transiently transfected K562 cells (Gong and Dean, 1993Gong Q. Dean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 911-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested by these workers that GATA-1 motif may function by conferring position-independent expression of linked genes, instead of acting as a classical enhancer element. However, interpretation of the above data was complicated by 5′HS-2 being only a part of the β-LCR. Our data indicate that at least GATA-1(c) is involved in the final stage of transcriptional activation of the α-like globin promoters by HS-40 in embryonic/fetal as well as in adult erythroid cells, although the effect of GATA-1(c) mutation on HS-40 enhancer-directed activation of the ζ2-globin promoter in K562 cells is not as great as the GT II or NF-E2/AP1 motifs (Fig. 3; see below). Interestingly, mutation of GATA-1(d) motif, which is bound with nuclear factor(s) in the adult erythroid environment but not in K562 cells (Strauss et al., 1992Strauss E.C. Andrews N.C. Higgs D.R. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2135-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indeed has no effect on HS-40 enhancer function in K562 cells. It is involved, however, in the transcriptional activation of the human α-globin promoter by HS-40 in transiently transfected MEL cells (Fig. 3). Since the above three GATA-1 mutations would prohibit binding of the GATA-1 factor (Ko and Engel, 1993Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), our data indicate that nuclear factor-DNA complexes formed at the GATA-1(c) and GATA-1(d) motifs play active roles in the erythroid cell-specific and developmental stage-specific enhancer function of the HS-40 or α-LCR. On the other hand, mutation in the GATA-1(b) motif, which is occupied by nuclear factors in both K562 cells and adult erythroblasts (Zhang et al., 1993Zhang Q. Reddy P.M. Yu C.-Y. Bastiani C. Higgs D.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.-K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13 (1308): 2298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), showed no effect in transfected K562 (FIG. 2, FIG. 3). We suspect that in erythroid cells of embryonic/fetal lineage such as K562, this GATA-1 motif is involved at an earlier regulatory step of HS-40 function such as the assembly of an active chromatin structure. The function of the GT motif of 5′HS-2 of the β-LCR has been analyzed previously. Its mutation has only a minimal effect on the enhancer function of either a synthetic 5′HS-2 fragment in stably integrated cells (Ellis et al., 1993Ellis J. Talbot D. Dillon N. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 129-134Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or a native 5′HS-2 in transgenic mice (Caterina et al., 1991Caterina J.J. Ryan T.M. Pawlick K.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Behringer R.R. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1626-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The drastic decrease in the enhancer effect of HS-40 carrying a mutation in its GT motif, GT II (Fig. 3), strongly suggests that the nuclear factor-DNA complex(es) at the GT motif is an essential and integral part of the multiple protein-DNA complexes formed in HS-40 during its final step of activating the α-like globin promoters in erythroid cells of different developmental stages. Sp1 is the major protein in K562 nuclear extract that binds the wild type HS-40 GT motif. However, it cannot bind to the mutant GT motif. 2G. N. Reddy, unpublished data. The close proximity of GT II to the 3′NF-E2/AP1 motif also implies that nuclear factor-DNA complexes formed at these two motifs may directly interact with each other. The function of the tandemly arranged, dimeric NF-E2/AP1 motifs of 5′HS-2 of the β-LCR has been extensively studied previously by the analysis of mutated 5′HS-2 or β-LCR in transiently transfected cells, in stably integrated cell lines, or in transgenic mice. These results have demonstrated that intact dimeric NF-E2/AP1 motifs are required for 5′HS-2 to function as a potent erythroid-specific enhancer. However, the dimer motifs do not play any role in β-LCR or 5′HS-2-mediated, integration site-independent expression of different human β-like globin promoters (Moi and Kan, 1990Moi P. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9000-9004Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar; Ney et al., 1990aNey P.A. Sorrentino B.P. McDonagh K.T. Nienhuis A.W.

Blood. 1993; 82: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NF-E2/AP1 binding domain of HS-40 consists of two motifs separated by 6 bp, 5′-ATGACTCAGTG-3′ and 5′-TGCTGAGTCAT-3′, both of which can bind NF-E2 as well as AP1 (Jarman et al., 1991Jarman A.P.

Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). As we have discovered, contrasting with 5′HS-2, the NF-E2/AP1 motifs of the α-LCR, or HS-40, can function as either a positive or negative regulatory element. Introduction of a 3-bp mutation into the central core of either the 5′ or 3′ NF-E2/AP1 motif (Fig. 1 B) significantly lowered the HS-40 enhancer function to 5-25% of the wild type level (Fig. 3). However, when a GC base pair at one boundary of the 3′NF-E2/AP1 binding site is changed to TA (3′(NF-E2/AP1)-II, Fig. 1 B), the activity of the HS-40 enhancer, when placed in the genomic orientation relative to the ζ2-globin promoter in the plasmid, is increased by a factor of 2-3-fold in K562 cells. This is interesting since extensive studies have shown that the same 1-bp mutation abolishes the binding of NF-E2, but not AP1, to the sequence (5′-GCTGAGTCAT-3′/3′-CGACTCAGTA-5′), which is identical in the 5′NF-E2/AP1 motif of the 5′HS-2 enhancer, 3′NF-E2/AP1 motif of HS-40, and the NF-E2/AP1 site in the porphobilinogen deaminase promoter (Mignotte et al., 1989Mignotte V.

Blood. 1993; 82: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the 3-bp mutation would greatly affect the binding of both NF-E2 (Andrews et al., 1993aAndrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davison M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and AP1 (Smeal et al., 1989Smeal T. Angel P. Meek J. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar; Abate et al., 1991Abate C. Luk D. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3624-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The opposite effects of the 3- and 1-bp mutations of the 3′NF-E2/AP1 motif thus strongly suggest that binding of NF-E2 factor to the 3′NF-E2/AP1 motif, and possibly the 5′NF-E2/AP1 motif as well, represses the HS-40-mediated ζ2-globin promoter activity, while the binding of other AP1 factor(s) to the same motif(s) positively regulates the HS-40 function on ζ2 promoter expression in K562 cells. Given that K562 is an erythroid cell line trapped during the embryonic to fetal transition (Lozzio and Lozzio, 1975Lozzio C.B. Lozzio B.B. Blood. 1975; 45: 321-334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the relative concentration of NF-E2 to AP1 in erythroid cells appears to increase as development proceeds (Andrews et al., 1993aAndrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davison M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), it is likely that transcriptional activation and silencing of the human ζ2-globin gene during embryonic to fetal erythroid development is partly modulated by the competitive binding of positive regulatory AP1 and negative regulatory NF-E2 factors to the α-LCR. Of course, we cannot rule out the possible involvement of other nuclear factors capable of binding to the NF-E2/AP1 motif(s) in the positive and negative regulation of the HS-40 enhancer effect (Chan et al., 1993Chan J.Y.

The apparent negative regulatory effect of NF-E2 binding on the HS-40 enhancer-directed expression of ζ2-globin promoter activity is reminiscent of the negative regulation of several non-erythroid eukaryotic gene systems mediated through binding of the c-Fos-c-Jun complex at AP1 binding sites (Nicholson et al., 1990Nicholson R.C.

Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It is also known that specific nuclear factor binding DNA motif(s) can function as either a positive or negative regulatory element, depending on the cellular environment (Miner and Yamamoto, 1991Miner J.N. Yamamoto K.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 525-530PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, an enhancer could sometimes function as a silencer (Jiang et al., 1993Jiang J. Cai H. Zhou Q. Levine M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3201-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2006119649,"Previous studies showed a complex relationship between nucleotide composition of a gene and the rate of the gene's evolutionary variation. We have investigated mechanisms by constructing M13 phagemids containing part of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene, in which an opal codon is flanked either by nine adenine ˙ thymine base pairs on each side, or by nine guanine ˙ cytosine pairs, or by its wild-type sequence context. Reversions or pseudoreversions within the opal codon yield a lacZ α-peptide that can undergo α-complementation and yield a blue plaque when plated with a chromogenic substrate. When these constructs were replicated in HeLa cell extracts, in the presence of equimolar deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) mixtures, reversion was near background levels in both the AT-rich and GC-rich contexts. By contrast, when the DNAs were replicated at dNTP concentrations approximating those in HeLa cell nuclei, increases over background were seen in all three contexts. Replication of the phagemids in vivo led to even higher mutation frequencies. Replication in the presence of dGMP, added to inhibit proofreading, caused extraordinarily high reversion frequencies in the GC-flanked opal codon. Apparently, dNTP concentrations approximating intracellular concentrations are mildly but significantly mutagenic, and pool asymmetries and base sequence context both contribute to the natural fidelity of DNA replication.

Apparently, dNTP concentrations approximating intracellular concentrations are mildly but significantly mutagenic, and pool asymmetries and base sequence context both contribute to the natural fidelity of DNA replication. Most in vitro studies have been carried out either at rather extreme dNTP pool biases, or with unnatural DNA templates, or both. The present studies were designed to ask: 1) whether replication of a natural gene sequence, at dNTP concentrations approximating natural pool asymmetries, is mutagenic; and 2) whether the immediate base sequence context influences replicative error rates in ways that would help explain the observed relationships between base composition of a gene and its evolutionary variation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThese studies used the modified phage M13mp2SV, described by Roberts and Kunkel, 1988Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7064-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar. This phage contains in its genome an SV40 DNA replication origin and a mutational target consisting of the first 45 codons for Escherichia coli β-galactosidase plus 115 nucleotides of upstream sequence. Expression of the 45 codons of wild-type sequence generates a peptide that can undergo α-complementation when introduced into a host strain, E. coli CSH50, which expresses the remainder of the lacZ gene. Complementation is scored by plating in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β- D-galactoside, a chromogenic substrate for β-galactosidase. A deep blue plaque is scored as wild-type, while mutants yield white or light blue plaques. Constructs for the reversion assays described here were prepared from M13mp2SV by site-directed mutagenesis, using the methods of Kunkel et al., 1987Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

The host strain for electroporation, E. coli NR9162, was mutS−, to minimize loss of replicational heterozygotes due to mismatch repair. In the reversion assays, plates were incubated for 15-18 h at 37°C, followed by an additional 48-h incubation at room temperature, to allow detection of the maximum number of mutational events.dNTP pool measurements were carried out essentially as described by North et al., 1980North T.W.

These analyses, when carried out on the concentrated HeLa cell extracts used for the replication reactions, confirmedthat the dNTPs in these extracts contributed negligibly toward the dNTP concentrations in each reaction mixture. Also, similar analyses confirmed that dNTP degradation in the replication reactions was negligible (less than 5% of the starting values) over the course of the replication reactions.For analysis of the M13mp2SV derivatives that had replicated in vivo, COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) 1The abbreviation used is:DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. plus 10% fetal bovine serum to about 40% confluence, then washed twice with Opti-MEM reduced serum medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). For each 100-mm culture dish, 3 μg of replicative form I DNA and 10 μl of Transfectase reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) were diluted to 300 μl with Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium, then mixed together. After standing 20 min at room temperature for formation of lipid-DNA complexes, each mixture was diluted to 3.0 ml with the same medium and added to cells treated as described above. Cells were incubated for 10 h at 37°C, and then 3.0 ml of DMEM plus 20% fetal bovine serum was added, and incubation was continued for 24 h. At that point, medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubation continued for 12 h more. After trypsin treatment and centrifugation, each cell pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 200 μl of 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 m M EDTA, and 100 μg/ml RNase A. Cells were lysed by adding an equal volume of 0.2 M NaOH and 1% SDS. Chromosomal DNA and cell debris were precipitated by adding potassium acetate, pH 4.8, to a final concentration of 0.44 M, followed by centrifugation. Episomal DNA was purified through Wizard mini-columns (Promega), and unreplicated DNA was eliminated from each mixture by digestion with DpnI prior to electroporation into E. coli NR9162 and subsequent analysis for revertants.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOriginally we contemplated a “global” approach to analyzing the relationship between DNA base composition, dNTP pool asymmetry, and mutagenesis. We planned to modify the G+C content of the 135-base pair protein-coding part of the lacZ gene in M13mp2SV, to values as high and low as possible without changing the amino acid sequence of the encoded lacZ α-peptide. We would then replicate these modified constructs in vitro, in the presence of dNTP concentrations chosen to represent the approximate levels within HeLa cell nuclei (Leeds et al., 1985Leeds J.M. Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3443-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and determine the extent to which the natural asymmetry in dNTP levels influenced replication error frequencies. This latter analysis would involve a forward mutation assay (lacZ+ ⟶ lacZ−), where mutations anywhere in the 135-base pair target could be scored as a change in plaque color from dark blue to white or light blue.However, a preliminary analysis (Table I) indicated that this approach would not be feasible. M13mp2SV DNA was replicated either in the presence of an equimolar dNTP mixture (100 μM each dNTP) or an asymmetric mixture representing the estimated dNTP concentrations in S-phase HeLa cell nuclei (60 μM dATP, 60 μM dTTP, 30 μM dCTP, 10 μM dGTP) (Leeds et al., 1985Leeds J.M. Slabaugh M.B. Mathews C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3443-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In both cases the replicated DNA samples showed significantly more mutants than unreplicated controls, which were treated identically to the experimental reaction mixtures, except for the omission of SV40 T-antigen during incubations with HeLa cell extract. However, we did not see a significant difference in mutation frequencies between the equimolar and asymmetric dNTP mixtures. It was apparent that an extremely large number of plates would have to be counted, if we were to learn whether the small difference we did observe was significant, since detection of white or light blue plaques can be done only if there are fewer than about 500 dark blue plaques/plate.Table I:Forward mutation assay: lac+ ⟶ lac−Table I:Forward mutation assay: lac+ ⟶ lac−0.5 μg of M13mp2SV replicative form DNA was replicated in each assay for 6 h, as described by Roberts and Kunkel, 1988Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7064-7068Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, at the specified dNTP concentrations. Incorporation of radioactivity from [α-32P]dCTP confirmed that replication was undetectable in the controls incubated in the absence of SV40 T antigen.Accordingly, we turned from the global to a more local approach, involving reversion and pseudoreversion events within one codon. Reversion analysis in this system involves scoring blue plaques against a white plaque background, and this allows inspection of a far larger number of plaques per plate than does the forward mutation assay. For our analysis we chose a serine codon (residue 7) in a flexible part of the lacZα mutational target. The TCA encoding this serine was changed to an opal codon (TGA), and revertants or pseudorevertants were scored as dark blue or light blue plaque formers.Extensive sequence analysis of mutants generated during in vitro replication of the lacZα target in M13mp2 and its derivatives has revealed few null (white plaque) mutations within this region (cf. Kunkel and Alexander, 1986Kunkel T.A. Alexander P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 160-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that most mutations occurring here allow some retention of wild-type protein function. This means that: 1) we can alter the sequences flanking this codon and expect relatively little effect on protein function, and 2) we can expect most single-base substitution errors involving the engineered opal codon to generate a wild or pseudo-wild phenotype and, hence, to be scored as mutational events in a reversion analysis.Because we are interested in sequence context as a determinant of replication fidelity in the presence of biologically biased dNTP concentrations, we wished to alter the base sequences flanking the local mutational target, namely the opal codon introduced in place of the serine-7 codon. Accordingly, we designed two sets of flanking sequences, as shown in Table II. In one construct, (AT)9TCA(AT)9, the opal codon was flanked on each side by nine adenine˙thymine base pairs, which generated two conservative changes in the six codons from the wild-type flanking sequence. Design of the other construct, (GC)9TCA(GC)9, required more changes in order to flank the opal codon with nine guanine˙cytosine pairs on each side. However, the changes apparently had little effect on function of the gene product, because many of the revertant plaques seen in analysis of all three constructs had a deep blue color indistinguishable from that given by the wild-type sequence.Table II:DNA constructs used in the reversion assayTable II:DNA constructs used in the reversion assayAside from the sequence alterations shown, each construct is identical to M13mp2SV. Each altered sequence extends from codon 4 through 10 of the coding sequence for the lacZ α-peptide.Data from two experiments, summarized in Table III, reveal several noteworthy results. First, as noted elsewhere (cf. Roberts et al., 1991Roberts J.D. Thomas D.C. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3465-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), replication in this in vitro system is quite accurate. The DNAs replicated in equimolar dNTP mixtures showed error rates comparable to those seen in the unreplicated controls (“background” in Experiment 2). Second, the biological asymmetry in DNA precursor pools apparently does contribute toward the natural mutation rate. In all three constructs the mutant fraction was significantly higher when the DNA was replicated at “biological” dNTP concentrations, biased as described in Table I. This effect was particularly significant in the (AT)9TCA(AT)9construct, where the mutant fractions in biological and equimolar dNTP mixtures differed by a factor of 3.5.Table III:Reversion and pseudoreversion mutations generated during DNA replicationTable III:Reversion and pseudoreversion mutations generated during DNA replicationThe DNA constructs described in Table II were replicated in vitro as described for Table I, except that the incubation period was 3 h. All dark blue and light blue plaques were scored as mutations, and the mutant fraction is the ratio of mutant to total plaques counted. The actual numbers of mutant and total plaques scored after each incubation are shown in parentheses. “Background” denotes DNAs incubated in the absence of SV40 T antigen, where no detectable replication occurred. “Replicated in vivo” means replicated in, and isolated from, COS7 cells. ND, not determined.The third noteworthy result is the fact that replication of the three constructs in vivo, rather than under biologically biased pool conditions in vitro, also yielded mutant fractions significantly above background. In fact, as shown in the fourth line of Experiment 2, these values were even somewhat higher than the corresponding values from the in vitro experiment (third line). Of course, factors other than dNTP asymmetries may well contribute toward the error rates seen during replication in living cells. Mismatch repair, for example, could occur in vivo, but this would tend to decrease the mutant fractions to values lower than those seen after incubation in vitro. In any event, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that biological dNTP pool asymmetries contribute toward the natural replication error rate.Fourth, whether replicated in vivo in bacterial cells (“background”) or mammalian cells, or in vitro in equimolar or biologically biased dNTP pools, replication was significantly more accurate when the opal codon was flanked by G˙C base pairs than with either A˙T base pairs or with the natural nucleotides. This may reflect the stability of guanine˙cytosine base pairs, which could lower the tolerance for insertion of incorrectly base paired nucleotides. This interpretation is consistent with the relatively large difference in mutant fraction between equimolar and biologically biased pools for the AT-flanked opal codon, described above. Formation of a C˙dGTP pair occurs during normal replication of the 3′-ACT-5′ trinucleotide in the antisense strand at the opal codon. If mispairing in this site at low dGTP concentrations occurs more readily in an AT-rich sequence context, then the results described in the previous two paragraphs are readily understood. It seems unlikely that variations in mismatch repair are involved, because mismatch repair activities are thought to be low during replication in HeLa cell extracts (Roberts et al., 1991Roberts J.D. Thomas D.C. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3465-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Fifth, although a GC-rich sequence context seems to promote correct base pairing at the insertion step, maintenance of high fidelity is highly dependent upon proofreading of insertion errors that do occur. Note both from Experiment 1 and from the fifth and sixth lines from Experiment 2 in Table III the extraordinary sensitivity of the (GC)9TGA(GC)9target to inhibition of proofreading, brought about by addition of a deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate at high concentrations. Error rates increased in all three constructs, but the severalfold increment in replication accuracy caused by GC-rich flanking sequences when proofreading was not inhibited was replaced by a decrement in replication accuracy, by about an order of magnitude, when proofreading was inhibited.Essentially the same conclusion can be drawn from the “dGTP excess” experiments (Experiment 2, last line). Presumably, the mutations here were caused largely by the next nucleotide effect, which involves pool-driven incorporation of nucleotides past the site of a substitution error before that error can be repaired exonucleolytically (Roberts et al., 1991Roberts J.D. Thomas D.C. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3465-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Again, if helix unwinding is slower when the site of an error is flanked by guanine˙cytosine pairs, the sensitivity of the (GC)9TGA(GC)9construct to mutagenesis under these conditions is easily understood.To propose an effect of flanking helix stability upon proofreading efficiency in this system is to propose that proofreading in eukaryotic DNA replication involves significant helix unwinding to place the primer terminus in the 3′ exonuclease site, as evidently occurs in prokaryotic DNA replication (Beese et al., 1993Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Whereas structural studies on eukaryotic replication proteins make this a reasonable expectation (cf. Wang, 1991Wang T.S.-F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar; Beckman and Loeb, 1994Beckman R.A. Loeb L.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1994; 26: 225-331Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it has not been explicitly demonstrated. However, our results are consistent with this model.The influence of base sequence context upon replication fidelity has long been apparent, simply from the existence of hot spots for spontaneous mutagenesis. However, systematic analysis of this phenomenon has begun only recently. Of particular interest is a study of Bloom et al., 1994Bloom L.B. Otto M.R. Eritja L.J. Reha-Krantz L.J. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7576-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, who used pre-steady-state kinetic analysis to analyze 3′ exonucleolytic proofreading, and who showed also the influence of helix stability at the primer terminus upon replication accuracy. The system of Bloom et al. involves proofreading of a nucleotide analog, in replication of synthetic DNA templates by a purified DNA polymerase. By contrast, our system involves replication of natural or near-natural DNA sequences by a multiprotein replication apparatus using natural DNA precursors at concentrations that can be adjusted to near-natural levels. Both kinds of analyses should be mutually supportive as investigations of spontaneous mutagenesis continue.The preliminary results reported here demonstrate, we believe, the utility of this approach to understanding the effects of natural dNTP asymmetries upon replication accuracy and spontaneous mutagenesis. The results suggest a variety of informative approaches to be taken in subsequent investigations, including sequence analysis of the revertants, analysis of different sequence contexts (e.g. AT upstream, GC downstream), and more definitive analyses of the effective dNTP concentrations at eukaryotic DNA replication sites. Most in vitro studies have been carried out either at rather extreme dNTP pool biases, or with unnatural DNA templates, or both. The present studies were designed to ask: 1) whether replication of a natural gene sequence, at dNTP concentrations approximating natural pool asymmetries, is mutagenic; and 2) whether the immediate base sequence context influences replicative error rates in ways that would help explain the observed relationships between base composition of a gene and its evolutionary variation.

https://openalex.org/W1993232733,"Analysis of the core promoter sequence of the mammalian ribosomal RNA genes revealed an E-box-like sequence (CACGCTG) to which the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) binds. Because the core promoter binding factor (CPBF) binds specifically to the core promoter sequence of the ribosomal RNA gene (Liu, Z., and Jacob, S. T. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 16618-16626) and resembles USF in some respects, we explored the potential relationship between USF and CPBF. Competition electrophoretic mobility shift assay using labeled core promoter probe and several unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides showed that USF can indeed bind to the core promoter and that only those oligonucleotides with an E-box sequence could compete in the promoter-protein complex formation characteristic of CPBF. This complex formation was thermostable, a unique property of USF. Furthermore, antibodies raised against USF cross-reacted with the 44-kDa component of rat CPBF. To prove further the relationship between CPBF and USF, we examined the effects of the unlabeled USF and ribosomal gene core promoter oligonucleotides on polymerase (pol) I and pol II transcription. Both oligonucleotides inhibited rDNA transcription as well as transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter. Only the oligonucleotides that contain the E-box sequence competed in the transcription. These data indicate that the promoter sequence of mammalian ribosomal RNA gene contains an USF-binding site, that the 44-kDa polypeptide of CPBF is related to the 44/43-kDa polypeptide of human USF, and that USF or USF-related protein can transactivate both pol I and pol II promoters. Analysis of the core promoter sequence of the mammalian ribosomal RNA genes revealed an E-box-like sequence (CACGCTG) to which the upstream stimulatory factor (USF) binds. Because the core promoter binding factor (CPBF) binds specifically to the core promoter sequence of the ribosomal RNA gene (Liu, Z., and Jacob, S. T. (1994) J. Biol.

Transcription of ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) is controlled by cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors (usually proteins) that interact with the specific cis-elements (for reviews, see Refs. 1Sollner-Webb B. Mougey E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 58-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 2Paule M.R. Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar-3Jacob S.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 617-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). There are three important cis-acting elements on rDNA, namely promoters, enhancers, and terminators. The core promoter region of most species lies between −40 and +10 with respect to the initiation site. The enhancer element in rat rDNA consists of a repeat element (11.5 times repeat of a 130-base pair sequence) (4Dixit A. Garg L.C. Chao W. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11616-11622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ghosh A.K. Hoff C.M. Jacob S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 125: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) located proximal to the core promoter and a non-repeat element far upstream (approximately 2 kilobase pairs from the +1 site) of the core promoter (4Dixit A. Garg L.C. Chao W. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11616-11622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A third cis-acting element, which is rather unique to ribosomal RNA gene, is a terminator sequence located at the 3′ end of pre-ribosomal RNA coding region and just upstream of the promoter (7Grummt I. Maier U. Ohrlein A. Hassouna N. Bachellerie J.P. Cell. 1985; 43: 801-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Until 1990, only limited success was achieved in the characterization of all the crucial trans-acting factors that interact with the various cis-elements on rDNA and regulate rDNA transcription initiation. In the past 3 years, however, significant achievements have been made in this regard. In addition to RNA polymerase I, initiation of rDNA transcription requires TATA-binding factor (TBP) and TBP-associated pol-specific factors called TAFs, present in a complex called SL1 (8Comai L. Tanese N. Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The species specificity of pol I transcription, which is one of the hallmarks of pol I transcription, appears to reside in one or more of TAFs (9Rudloff U. Eberhard D. Tora L. Stunnenberg H. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2611-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human or frog SL1 does not interact with respective core promoter element unless another factor, upstream binding factor (UBF), is also present (10Learned R.M. Cordes S. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1358-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11McStay B. Hu C.-H. Pikaard C.S. Reeder R.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2297-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The rodent SL1, however, can independently bind to the core promoter (12Smith S.D. Oriaha E. Lowe D. Yang-Yen H.-F. O'Mahoney D. Rose K. Chen K. Rothblum L.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3105-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).A factor from the rat mammary adenocarcinoma ascites cells designated E1BF (enhancer 1-binding factor) that binds to the enhancer and promoters of rat rDNA was characterized in our laboratory (13Zhang J. Jacob S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5177-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Subsequent study showed that this protein is related to the human Ku autoantigen (14Hoff C.M. Jacob S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that it is involved in the initiation of rDNA transcription, particularly in the preinitiation complex formation (15Hoff C.M. Ghosh A.K. Prabhakar B.S. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, we have characterized another protein from the rat cells, called core promoter-binding factor (CPBF) (16Liu Z. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16618-16626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein consists of two polypeptides with molecular masses of 44 and 39 kDa. Reconstitution transcription assay showed that it is essential for rDNA transcription. Immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies against the human Ku protein revealed that rat E1BF can cross-react with these antibodies and that it can interact physically and functionally with CPBF (17Niu H. Zhang J. Jacob S.T. Gene Exp. 1995; 4: 111-124PubMed Google Scholar). Because association between E1BF and CPBF enhances DNase I footprinting of the core promoter 2H. Niu and S. T. Jacob, unpublished observation. 2H. Niu and S. T. Jacob, unpublished observation. and stimulates rDNA transcription in a synergistic manner, it was of interest to characterize CPBF further with respect to the nature of its functional interaction with E1BF/Ku. In the course of this study, we found that CPBF, the core promoter-binding factor, is immunologically and functionally related to USF, the upstream stimulatory factor.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and OligodeoxynucleotidesThe following plasmids were used for transcriptional analysis: (a) pB7-2.0 plasmid, which contains rat rDNA region spanning from −167 to +2000; and (b) pAdML(C2AT) plasmid, which contains adenovirus major late promoter spanning −400 to +10 linked to a 390-base pair synthetic DNA fragment containing C, A, and T residues (for details, see Ref. 18Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar).The oligonucleotides used as double-stranded DNA probes and competitors in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay were (a) rat core promoter (rCP), (b) mouse metallothionein-I (MT-I) MLTF, (c) mouse MT-I MRE-d, (d) mouse MT-I Sp1, (e) CTF/NF1, and (f) Oct 1. Oligonucleotides rCP, MLTF, MRE-d, and Sp1 were synthesized in the in-house facility. The oligonucleotides CTF/NF1 and Oct 1 were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI).Preparation of CPBF and Extracts for TranscriptionWhole cell extract was prepared from rat mammary adenocarcinoma ascites cells and rat hepatoma N1-S1 cells essentially as described by Zhang and Jacob (13Zhang J. Jacob S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5177-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and was fractionated by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. The fraction eluting with 175 m M (NH4)2SO4, designated DE-B, was used for rDNA transcription (19Kurl R.N. Rothblum L.I. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 81: 6672-6675Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HeLa nuclear extract was prepared following the protocol of Shapiro et al. (20Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). CPBF was purified to homogeneity from rat mammary adenocarcinoma ascites cells according to the procedure of Liu and Jacob (16Liu Z. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16618-16626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 44- and 39-kDa polypeptides comprising CPBF were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by silver staining.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using labeled rat rDNA core promoter, MLTF, and fraction DE-B was performed as described by Liu and Jacob (16Liu Z. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16618-16626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In Vitro Transcription AnalysisIn vitro transcription of rat rDNA was performed essentially as described by Kurl et al. (19Kurl R.N. Rothblum L.I. Jacob S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 81: 6672-6675Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Plasmid pB7-2.0 linearized with XhoI was used as the template. The size of the correct run-off transcript (initiated at the +1 site) must be 635 nucleotides. In vitro transcription of the pAdML(C2AT) template was carried out essentially as described by Sawadogo and Roeder (18Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In competition transcription assays, the extracts were preincubated with competitor oligonucleotides for 10 min on ice prior to addition of the templates. RNA was extracted and electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gels. The transcripts were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometric scanning using One scanner (Apple Computer, Inc.) and the Scan Analysis Program.Western Blot AnalysisHeLa nuclear extract, fraction DE-B from rat ascites cell extract, and purified CPBF were subjected to electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For immunodetection, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). The membranes were probed with anti-USF antibody (1:1000 dilution) and washed three times with TBST. The bound primary antibody was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Promega), and the color was developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium solution.RESULTSThe Core Promoter Regions of Mammalian Ribosomal RNA Gene Contain an E-box-like SequenceThe similarities in the molecular size and other characteristics of the human gene-specific USF and the larger polypeptide of CPBF prompted us to examine closely the rat ribosomal RNA gene promoter for a potential USF-binding site. Analysis of the core promoter sequence of rat, mouse, hamster, and human ribosomal RNA gene revealed the presence of a sequence CACGCTG (located between +6 and +12 with respect to the initiation site) that was similar to the E-box motif (CACGTG) (24Muree C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar) to which USF (upstream stimulatory factor) binds (see Fig. 1). Although the rDNA promoter sequence contained an additional C in the potential USF binding site, it was logical to investigate further the structural and functional relationship between CPBF and USF.CPBF and USF, the Basic Helix-Loop-Helix-Zipper DNA-binding Protein, Bind to the Same Sequence within the Rat rDNA Core PromoterTo prove the potential relationship between CPBF and USF, we studied the specificity of the CPBF binding to the rDNA promoter sequence by a competition EMSA. Fraction DE-B prepared from N1-S1 cells was preincubated with unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides before addition of the labeled core promoter. In the absence of cold competitor oligonucleotide, a doublet (indicated by arrows) of CPBF-DNA complex (C) was observed (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). An oligonucleotide representing the rat core promoter region with a E-box motif (see Fig. 1) efficiently competed for the CPBF binding activity (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). To confirm that CPBF binding activity represents USF or USF-related protein, unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the MLTF/USF binding site on the mouse metallothionein-I gene promoter was used in the EMSA. This oligonucleotide containing the E-box motif also competed as efficiently as the rat rDNA promoter oligonucleotide for the CPBF binding activity (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). The specificity of the competition was assessed by using oligonucleotides that do not contain E-box motif, namely Sp1, MRE-d (derived from the mouse MT-I gene promoter), NF1, and Oct 1. The oligonucleotide Sp1 that binds Sp1 (25Mueller P.R. Salser S.J. Wold B. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) did not compete for CPBF binding activity (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). Similarly, the metal-responsive element MRE-d that binds another transcription factor (26Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Garglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) did not compete for the CPBF binding activity (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). The other two competitor oligonucleotides, NF1 and Oct 1, which bind the transcription factors CTF/NF1 and Oct 1, respectively, also did not compete for CPBF (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8). The slower migrating bands probably represent the complex between the core promoter and the RNA polymerase I transcription factor E1BF (13Zhang J. Jacob S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5177-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).FIG. 2A, electrophoretic mobility shift assay using rat core promoter oligonucleotide (rCP) and fraction DE-B (4 μg) from rat N1-S1 cells. Lane 1, 32P-labeled 58-base pair rCP alone; lane 2, rCP and fraction DE-B. In competition assay, fraction DE-B was preincubated with 100 ng each of the oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to rCP (lane 3), MLTF (lane 4), Sp1 (lane 5), MRE-d (lane 6), NF1 (lane 7), and Oct 1 (lane 8) (see “ExperimentalProcedures” for details on the competitors).

In competition assay fraction DE-B was preincubated for 10 min. with 100 ng each of unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the binding sequences for rCP (lane 3), MLTF (lane 4), MRE-d (lane 5), Sp1 (lane 6), and NF1 (lane 7). Each reaction contained 100 ng of poly(dI˙dC) as nonspecific competitor. F designates the free probe, C represents the USF protein-MLTF complex, and C1 represents possibly E1BF protein interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test further the potential relationship of CPBF and USF, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using labeled major late transcription factor (MLTF), which is known to bind USF. Fraction DE-B from N1-S1 cells was preincubated with unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides before the addition of labeled MLTF oligonucleotide. In absence of the cold competitor, a doublet (C) of USF-DNA complex was observed (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), which is similar to the doublet of CPBF-DNA complex (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). The most noteworthy observation was that the USF-DNA complex formation was efficiently competed by cold oligonucleotide corresponding to the rat rDNA core promoter oligonucleotide (rCP) (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). As expected, MLTF oligonucleotide also competed for this complex formation (Fig. 2 B, lane 4), whereas MRE-d, Sp1, and NF1 oligonucleotides that do not contain E-box motif did not compete for the USF-DNA interaction (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5-7). The complex C1 (Fig. 2 B) probably represents E1BF-DNA interaction, which is competed by cold rCP, MLTF, and to some extent by SP1 and NF1 but not by MRE-d.CPBF Is Immunologically Related to USFTo substantiate further that CPBF is related to USF, an immunoblot analysis was performed using fraction DE-B from rat cells, HeLa nuclear extract, and purified CPBF, and polyclonal antibodies against the 43-kDa USF component. A strong reactivity of a 43-kDa protein and a weak reactivity to the 44-kDa protein was observed in HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), whereas a strong reactivity to a 44-kDa protein and a weak reactivity to a 43-kDa protein were observed with fraction DE-B from the rat cells (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). The antibody cross-reacted exclusively to the 44-kDa polypeptide of CPBF but not to the 39-kDa polypeptide in the purified preparation (Fig. 3, B and C). The large polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 116 kDa that cross-reacts with the anti-USF antibodies in both fraction DE-B and HeLa nuclear extract probably represents TFII-I, which is known to cross-react with the anti-USF antibodies (27Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the 44-kDa polypeptide of CPBF is immunologically related to USF or that rat CPBF is the rat homolog of human USF.FIG. 3Immunological relationship of rat CPBF to USF. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-HeLa 43-kDa USF-1 antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). Panel A, lane 1, fraction DE-B (100 μg) from rat ascites cells; lane 2, HeLa nuclear extract (100 μg). The solid arrowhead indicates the immune complex formed between the 44-kDa polypeptide of CPBF and anti-USF antibodies. The open arrowhead indicates the immune complex formed between the 43-kDa human USF1 and anti-USF antibodies. Panel B, purified CPBF (100 ng) was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver-stained. The 44- and 39-kDa polypeptides are indicated by arrowheads. Panel C, immune complex formed between the 44-kDa polypeptide of CPBF and anti-USF antibodies. The solid arrowhead indicates the immune complex formed between the 44-kDa polypeptide of purified rat CPBF and anti-USF antibodies.

To test this possibility, the plasmid (pB7-2.0) containing the rat rDNA was transcribed in fraction DE-B prepared from the rat hepatoma N1-S1 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). This fraction supported efficient and correct transcription of rat rDNA in absence of competitor oligonucleotides (Fig. 4 A, lane 1). Preincubation with increasing amounts of cold rat core promoter (rCP) resulted in drastic reduction (90%) of transcription (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 3). As anticipated, cold MLTF oligonucleotide also inhibited transcription to similar extent (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). By contrast, MRE-d, which does not bind or compete for CPBF or E1BF (see Fig. 2 A), did not affect the pol I transcription (Fig. 4 A, lane 5).FIG. 4A, inhibition of rat rRNA gene transcription by MLTF oligonucleotide in trans. Lane 1, rat rDNA (pB7-2.0) (100 ng) was transcribed in fraction DE-B (25 μg) from rat hepatoma N1-S1 cells (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Lanes 2 and 3 represent the transcripts synthesized in the extract that was preincubated with 100 and 200 ng of rCP, respectively. Lanes 4 and 5, transcription after preincubation of fraction DE-B with 200 ng each of MLTF and MRE-d oligonucleotides, respectively, and then pB7-2.0 template was added to the reactions.

AdML G-less cassette was transcribed in HeLa nuclear extract (72 μg) in the absence or presence of competitors (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Lane 1, control transcription in absence of competitors; lane 2, HeLa nuclear extract was preincubated with 100 ng of rat rCP oligonucleotide and pAdMLP(C2AT) (250 ng) was added to the reaction. HeLa nuclear extract was preincubated with 100 ng each of MLTF oligonucleotide (lane 3), NF1 oligonucleotide (lane 4), MRE-d oligonucleotide (lane 5) before addition of template and then pAdMLP(C2AT) was added and transcription was carried out (see “Experimental Procedures” for details of transcription assay). Arrow indicates the 400-nucleotide specific transcript.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RNA Polymerase II-directed Transcription from the Adenovirus Major Late Promoter Can Be Competed by Rat Core Promoter Oligonucleotide in TransTo establish further whether rat ribosomal gene core promoter binds USF or USF-like factors and whether such binding blocks pol II transcription, transcription of AdML promoter G-less cassette was performed in a transcriptionally competent HeLa nuclear extract in presence or absence of competitor oligonucleotides. This extract supported transcription from the AdML promoter and produced the correct 400-nucleotide transcript (Fig. 4 B, lane 1). Addition of competitor oligonucleotides corresponding to rat core promoter (rCP) and major late transcription factor (MLTF) binding site reduced transcription by 50% (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Addition of competitor oligonucleotide NF1 also reduced transcription (Fig. 4 B, lane 4), as the AdML promoter contains the binding site for CTF/NF1. On the contrary, addition of cold oligonucleotide MRE-d, which binds the transcription factor MTF-1 (26Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Garglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), failed to inhibit transcription from the AdML promoter (Fig. 4 B, lane 5). To prove further the relationship between the two factors, the effect of exogenous CPBF on transcription from the AdML promoter was studied. Addition of purified CPBF to the cell-free transcription reaction of AdML G-less cassette resulted in stimulation of transcription (data not shown). These results indicate that the rat core promoter region of rat rDNA can compete for USF or MLTF binding activity, which is known to participate in transcriptional activation of the AdML promoter by RNA polymerase II, and are consistent with the existence of a USF/MLTF recognition sequence in the ribosomal gene promoter.DISCUSSIONThe present study has demonstrated that the 44-kDa polypeptide of rat CPBF is immunologically and functionally related to the RNA polymerase II transcription factor USF/MLTF (28Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). It is likely that CPBF is the rat homolog of human USF protein. Several lines of evidence presented here support such a notion. First, anti-USF antibodies cross-react with the 44-kDa subunit of CPBF. Second, binding of CPBF to rDNA core promoter can be inhibited by the MLTF/USF oligonucleotide in trans. Third, RNA polymerase I transcription is competed by MLTF oligonucleotide in trans, whereas RNA polymerase II transcription is competed by rat rDNA core promoter oligonucleotide in trans. Fourth, preincubation with an oligonucleotide that does not contain the E-box motif, the USF-binding site, does not block transcription. Finally, as observed for USF, CPBF is also thermostable; the major CPBF-DNA complex is unaltered in extracts incubated up to 55°C (data not shown).USF was identified initially by its ability to bind and activate the adenovirus major late promoter (29Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 43: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 30Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Two different forms of USF were identified in HeLa cells with molecular masses of 44 and 43 kDa (31Sawadogo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11994-12001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). USF can bind and activate several pol II promoters that include those of mouse metallothionein-I (25Mueller P.R. Salser S.J. Wold B. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 32Carthew R.W. Chodosh L.A. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and p53 (Ref. 33Reisman D. Rotter V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, and references therein). It can also stimulate pol III transcription of sea urchin U6 small nuclear RNA gene (34Li J. Parsons R.A. Marzluff W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2191-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the present study is the first report of the involvement of a USF related protein, namely CPBF, in pol I transcription. The strong immunological cross-reactivity of the 43-kDa (USF-1) antibody with the 44-kDa polypeptide of CPBF in fraction DE-B and purified fraction from rodent cells suggests that either the 44-kDa form is the predominant homolog of USF in rodent cells, or the CPBF polypeptide represents a new member of the USF family or the USF related-helix-loop-helix proteins (Refs. 28Gregor P.D. Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1730-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar and 35Sirito M. Lin Q. Maity T. Sawadogo M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, and references therein).Although CPBF from the rat cells contains a 39-kDa polypeptide, this polypeptide is not immunologically related to the larger polypeptide. The two CPBF polypeptides can bind to the core promoter (16Liu Z. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16618-16626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It i"
https://openalex.org/W2085126198,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a pleiotropic cytokine eliciting various responses in target cells upon binding to its receptor. Activation of the IL-4 receptor probably involves interaction of the ligand with both the IL-4 receptor α subunit (IL-4Rα) and the common γ chain (cγ). Although human and murine IL-4 receptor α chains are specific for IL-4 from the same species, murine cγ can form a signal-competent complex with human IL-4Rα (hIL-4Rα) and human IL-4 (hIL-4). We have generated a hIL-4 responsive murine myeloid cell line (FDC-4G) expressing a chimera comprising the extracellular domain of human IL-4Rα and the intracellular domain of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (hG-CSFR). This hybrid receptor was shown to form a complex with hIL-4 and the murine cγ-chain. Biological activities of human IL-4 variants on murine FDC-4G cells and on the human erythroleukemic cell line TF-1 displayed a strikingly different pattern. Single amino acid replacements at two different positions in the C-terminal helix of hIL-4, the region of the previously defined “signaling site,” lead to an inverse agonist/antagonist behavior of the resulting cytokines in the two cellular systems. From these findings we conclude that upon formation of the activated IL-4 receptor complex murine and human cγ interact with hIL-4 in a geometrically different fashion.

In order to investigate the interactions between hIL-4 and the two hIL-4 receptor components, we have established a hIL-4-responsive murine myeloid precursor cell line. A chimera of the extracellular domain of hIL-4Rα fused to the cytoplasmic portion of hG-CSFR was expressed in factor-dependent FDC-P1 cells and shown to become associated with murine cγ upon binding of hIL-4. Subsequently the formation of productive receptor complexes resulting in cell proliferation was studied using mutant variants of hIL-4. Comparison of the results with those obtained in a parallel set of experiments employing the hIL-4-responsive human cell line TF-1 revealed a different activity pattern of hIL-4 variants. These findings are discussed with respect to the putative interaction of hIL-4 with murine and human cγ. Total RNA was isolated from 1 g of fresh human placenta (obtained from Dr. J. Martius, Department of Gynecology, University of Würzburg) according to the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar), and used as a template for cDNA synthesis which was performed using Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA clone providing the extracellular domain of hIL-4Rα has been described previously (5Kruse N. Tony H.-P. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide synthesis, polymerase chain reactions, and other enzymatic manipulations of DNA were done following standard procedures (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Transfection of FDC-P1 cells was performed by electroporation using a Easyject+electroporator (Eurogentec). 3.5 × 106cells were washed and resuspended in 400 μl of DMEM, 5% FCS containing 50 μg of pKCR derivative and 2 μg of pSV2neo and subsequently subjected to an electric pulse of 250 V at 1500 microfarads.

After cultivation in 24-well plates for 2 weeks (medium was renewed twice), G418-resistant cell clones were propagated in 75-ml flasks and further screened for receptor expression by flow cytometry.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) in 100 μl of PBS for 20 min at 4°C, incubated with 100 μg/ml fluorescein (dichlorotriazinyl amino fluorescein)-conjugated goat-anti mouse IgG Fcγ fragment-specific (Dianova) and analyzed using a Coulter Epics Elite flow cytometer with a 488-nm laser. Iodination of recombinant hIL-4 was done as described (21Cabrillat J. Galizzi J.-P. Djossou O. Arai N. Yokota T. Arai K. Banchereau J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), specific activity of the radiolabeled cytokine (0, 5 μCi/pmol) was determined by competition binding measurements employing a solid phase binding assay based on the recombinant extracellular domain of hIL-4Rα (6Kruse N. Shen B.-J. Arnold S. Tony H.-P. Müller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Saturation binding experiments were performed after a standard protocol (22Park L.S. Friend D. Grabstein K. Urdal D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1669-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples of 2 × 106cells were incubated with varying concentrations of radioligand in a volume of 200 μl at 4°C for 2 h. Cells were then separated from unbound radioactivity by centrifugation through a silicon oil layer, and bound label was determined using a γ counter (Beckman). Unspecific binding of radioligand as measured in a parallel experiment, including at least 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand was subtracted before plotting the data. Samples of 3 × 107cells were rinsed twice with RPMI medium and incubated in 500 μl of RPMI, 2% bovine serum albumin containing 1 n M125I-labeled hIL-4 (0.5 μCi/pmol) at 4°C for 1 h. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold RPMI, treated with 1 m M disuccimidyl suberate (Pierce) in PBS at 4°C for 30 min, washed with PBS, and subsequently lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 m M NaCl, 1 m M EDTA, 0, 5% Nonidet P-40, 17 m M Na4P2O7, 2 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin). After an incubation at 4°C for 30 min the cell lysates were frozen at −70°C for 12 h and thawed on ice. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were gently rotated for 1 h at 4°C after addition of either 1 ng of anti-hIL-4Rα antibody X14/38, 2P. Reusch, unpublished data. or 0.5 μl of ascites fluid containing anti-mcγ antibody TUGm3 (2Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Arai K. Sugamura K. Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. K. Sugamura, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan). Precipitation of immunocomplexes was performed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 2 min after an additional incubation for 1 h at 4°C with 12 μl of anti-mouse IgG- (or anti-rat IgG)-agarose slurry (Sigma). The agarose pellets were washed once in lysis buffer, once in 100 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M LiCl, and finally boiled for 5 min in 2 × Laemmli buffer. Pellets were then removed by centrifugation and supernatants subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6%). After fixing in 12.5% acetic acid, 12.5% 2-propanol for 30 min, gels were dried and subsequently scanned for radioactivity using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Wild type hIL-4 and mutants R121D, Y124D, and S125D have been described previously (5Kruse N. Tony H.-P. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Kruse N. Shen B.-J. Arnold S. Tony H.-P. Müller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Double and triple mutants R121D/Y124D, R121D/S125D, Y124D/S125D, and R121D/Y124D/S125D, which have been constructed and purified in the same way and are described in detail elsewhere (20Tony H.-P. Shen B.-J. Reusch P. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As a source of murine IL-4 the culture supernatant (10%) of an mIL-4 secreting 3T3 transfectant cell line (provided by Dr. W. Müller, Institute of Genetics, University of Cologne) was used. Cytokine-induced proliferation of FDC-4G and TF-1 cells was measured either spectrometrically by means of blue formazan formation from 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide-tetrazolium (MTT) or by [3H] thymidine incorporation into de novo synthesized DNA as described previously (23Duschl A. Jahn U. Bertling C. Sebald W. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1992; 3: 97-102PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases cells were washed in medium twice to remove mIL-3 or hG-CSF and incubated with 100 or 200 μl of medium containing various concentrations of IL-4 or IL-4 variants for 24 h (FDC-4G cells) or 72 h (TF-1 cells), followed by incubation with MTT or [3H]thymidine for 4 h, respectively. Statistical evaluations of proliferation and radioligand binding data were done using the computer program GraFit (Erithacus Software). A hybrid gene comprising the first 232 codons of the human hIL-4Rα gene (encoding the signal peptide and the extracellular domain) (1Idzerda R.L. March C.J. Mosley B. Lyman S.D. Vanden Bos T. Gimpel S.D. Din W.S. Grabstein K.H. Widmer M.B. Park L.S. Cosman D. Beckman M.P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) fused to codons 605 through 813 of the hG-CSFR gene (24Fukunaga R. Seto Y. Mizushima S. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8702-8706Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (encoding the transmembrane and intracellular domain) was constructed in two consecutive steps. First a BamHI/ BclI fragment was amplified from hIL-4Rα cDNA by polymerase chain reaction with the 5′-primer STA12 (5′-CTAAGGATCCATGGGGTGGCTTTGCTCTG-3′) and the 3′-primer KHF8 (5′-AT-GCTGATCAAAGCTTCGATATCTTCTCGAGGTGCTGCTC-GAAGGGCTC-3′) and ligated into the unique BamHI site of the expression vector pKCR (14O'Hare K. Benoist C. Breathnach R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Primer KHF8 introduced unique restriction sites for both XhoI and HindIII into the plasmid. They were subsequently used to clone the hG-CSFR gene fragment which was amplified from human placenta total RNA with the primers KHF9 (5′-GAAGATCTCGAGATCATCCTGGGCCTG-3′) and KHF10 (5′-GAAGATCTGATATCTA-CTCGAGAAGCTTCTAGAAGCTCCCCAG-3′). The resulting construct pKCR-4G encodes a mature hybrid receptor protein of 417 amino acids length, including two codons (Leu-Glu) equivalent to the XhoI site at the fusion position (see Fig. 1). pKCR-4G along with the selection plasmid pSV2neo (15Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced into FDC-P1 cells by electroporation. After selection in the presence of G418, a resistant clone was stained with an hIL-4Rα specific monoclonal antibody and was analyzed for surface expression of hIL-4Rα by flow cytometry. The cells from this clone, termed FDC-4G, displayed an approximately 10-fold increase in fluorescence when compared with control cells (Fig. 2), thus clearly indicating a hIL-4Rα-positive phenotype. We next examined whether the G418-resistant transfectant clone FDC-4G had become responsive to hIL-4. FDC-P1 cells have been shown to respond to murine IL-4 by transient proliferation (25Carr C. Aykent S. Kimack N.M. Levine A.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); therefore we used mIL-4 as a control in the proliferation tests. Fig. 3 shows that although FDC-P1 cells were only responsive to mIL-4, transfectant clone FDC-4G also proliferated in a hIL-4-dependent manner. This was consistent with the cytometry data and confirmed that this cell line functionally expresses the hIL-4α/hG-CSFR hybrid receptor. Since the G-CSFR can transmit a sustained growth signal into factor-dependent FDC-P1 cells when activated by ligand-induced dimerization (26Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 27Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Fukunaga R. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we examined if hIL-4 could replace mIL-3 to allow for permanent culture of FDC-4G cells. Cultivation tests over a wide range of hIL-4 concentrations (up to 10 μM) showed that hIL-4, like mIL-4, can prevent cell death for only 72-96 h (data not shown). We next wished to measure the affinity for hIL-4 of the signaling-competent 4G hybrid receptor as well as the number of ligand binding sites per cell. Therefore the saturation binding experiment shown in Fig. 4 was performed. The Kdwas found to be 158 p M, which is in the same range as was determined for human peripheral T cells (5Kruse N. Tony H.-P. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A saturation of hIL-4 binding to FDC-4G cells was observed at a concentration of 69 p M bound radioligand. This value is equivalent to 3,500 hIL-4 binding sites/cell. Chemical cross-linking of radiolabeled hIL-4 to FDC-4G cells followed by immunoprecipitations using antibodies against IL-4R components was performed in order to define the composition of the operative receptor complex. As shown in Fig. 5, monoclonal antibody X14/38 directed against the extracellular domain of hIL-4Rα predominantly precipitates a radiolabeled complex with a molecular mass of approximately 75 kDa. This band originates from hIL-4 cross-linked to the hIL-4Rα/hG-CSFR hybrid receptor, since it corresponds to the expected size of the glycosylated chimera and does not appear in control precipitations from FDC-P1 cells (data not shown) and TF-1 cells. The latter instead show a dominant band (approximately 155 kDa) which can be attributed to a conjugate of iodinated hIL-4 and hIL-4Rα. Presence of the extracellular domain of hIL-4Rα in both complexes could also be proven by probing Western blots of immunoprecipitations with mAb X14/38 (data not shown). As a second component, murine common γ chain could be identified in the hIL-4 binding receptor complex on FDC-4G cells. In addition to the hIL-4/4G conjugate, a weaker band running at approximately 80 kDa was precipitated by anti-hIL-4Rα antibody. Due to its proximity to the intense 4G receptor band, it was only resolved on short exposures. This band showed the same migration behavior as the hIL-4/hcγ conjugate from TF-1 cells, 3A. Duschl, submitted for publication. and, together with the 4G hybrid derived band, appeared prominently when 125I-hIL-4 cross-linked proteins of FDC-4G cells were immunoprecipitated with mcγ-specific mAb TUGm3. Moreover, both hIL-4Rα- and mcγ-specific antibodies were capable of precipitating a molecular species of approximately 140 kDa in size, which most likely represents the ternary complex hIL-4/4G/mcγ. In order to address the activation of the 4G hybrid receptor during ligand binding, we subjected FDC-4G cells to proliferation experiments using a set of hIL-4 mutant proteins. It has been shown previously that hIL-4 variants with amino acid positions Arg121, Tyr124, and Ser125, respectively, exchanged for aspartic acid were affected in their signaling properties on hIL-4-responsive human cells (5Kruse N. Tony H.-P. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Kruse N. Shen B.-J. Arnold S. Tony H.-P. Müller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 28Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Therefore we employed variants R121D, Y124D, and S125D (6Kruse N. Shen B.-J. Arnold S. Tony H.-P. Müller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) as well as the double and triple mutants R121D/Y124D, R121D/S125D, Y124D/S125D, and R121D/Y124D/S125D (20Tony H.-P. Shen B.-J. Reusch P. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) to these tests. The TF-1 cell line expressing the authentic human IL-4R was used as a reference. The unexpected result was that proliferative activities of individual hIL-4 mutants were drastically different in the two cellular systems. As illustrated in Fig. 6A, mutants Y124D and S125D acted like wild type hIL-4 on FDC-4G cells, whereas variant R121D as well as double and triple hIL-4 mutants containing the R for D exchange at position 121 displayed no significant activity. Double mutant Y124D/S125D showed an intermediate, partial agonist phenotype. It has been demonstrated that hIL-4 Y124D behaves as a high affinity antagonist when assayed in proliferation tests with both human peripheral T cells (5Kruse N. Tony H.-P. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and TF-1 cells (28Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Our results with TF-1 (Fig. 6 B) were consistent with these findings. In contrast to FDC-4G cells, TF-1 cells respond to Y124D only to a minimal extent (partial agonist activity <5% of wild type). R121D, which was unable to induce FDC-4G proliferation, had some 30% partial agonist activity in the TF-1 system. All double and triple mutants were devoid of any detectable proliferative activity. Competition experiments were performed in order to address whether hIL-4 variants with the R121D mutation were inactive on FDC-4G cells because of impaired binding to the heterologous hIL-4R derivative expressed on these cells or due to antagonist properties of the mutant ligands. Fig. 7 shows that R121D as well as the double and triple mutants R121D/Y124D, R121D/S125D, and R121D/Y124D/S125D competitively inhibited hIL-4-induced proliferation of FDC-4G cells. The results obtained with Y124D confirmed that this variant, despite being a potent hIL-4 antagonist for TF-1 cells (28Zurawski S.M. Vega Jr., F. Huyghe B. Zurawski G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), has agonist activity on FDC-4G cells comparable with that of wild type hIL-4. Human IL-4 receptor α chain has been shown to render murine IL-4-reactive cells responsive to hIL-4 when expressed after gene transfer (8Harada N. Yang G. Miyajima A. Howard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22752-22758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Skoda R.C. Seldin D.C. Chiang M.K. Peichel C.L. Vogt T.F. Leder P.

Human and mouse IL-4Rα bind exclusively to IL-4 from the same species in vitro (7Morrison B.W. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11957-11963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hence IL-4Rα obviously mediates species specificity of the activated IL-4 receptor. Functional IL-4R, however, includes at least one additional receptor component that was found to be identical with the interleukin-2 receptor γ chain or cγ (2Kondo M. Takeshita T. Ishii N. Nakamura M. Watanabe S. Arai K. Sugamura K. Science. 1993; 262: 1874-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 3Russell S.M. Keegan A.D. Harada N. Nakamura Y. Noguchi M. Leland P. Friedman M.C. Miyajima A. Puri R.K. Paul W.E. Leonard W.J. Science. 1993; 262: 1880-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). hIL-4 responsiveness of murine cells due to expression of hIL-4Rα thus implies that murine cγ can accommodate both mIL-4 and hIL-4. In order to generate a hIL-4-responsive cell line, we have expressed a chimera of hIL-4Rα and hG-CSGR in FDC-P1 cells. The initial reason for taking this approach was our interest in the functional roles of individual IL-4R subunits. It is only beginning to become understood what particular contributions the cytoplasmic parts of IL-4Rα and cγ make to an IL-4-specific cellular response. Insight into the function of cytoplasmic portions of the IL-4R in the course of signaling is as yet limited. Cytoplasmic sequence elements of hIL-4Rα have been correlated with functional importance in hIL-4 induced proliferation (8Harada N. Yang G. Miyajima A. Howard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22752-22758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Koettnitz K. Kalthoff F.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 988-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a small sequence motif in the intracellular domain of IL-4Rα is critical for interaction with insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) protein (29Keegan A.D. Nelms K. White M. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 811-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), a molecular contact which probably (among other consequences) leads to an activation of phosphoinositol 3-kinase and apparently links the IL-4R to a signaling pathway with similarities to a set of reactions initiated by the activated insulin receptor. Two phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from the intracellular domain of hIL-4Rα were found to directly interact with the IL-4-inducible transcription factor IL-4 Stat (30Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). In addition, association of members of the JAK kinase family with the IL-4 receptor complex was demonstrated (31Johnston J.A. Kawamura M. Kirken R.A. Chen Y.-Q. Blake T.B. Shibuya K. Ortaldo J.R. McVicar D.W. O'Shea J.J. Nature. 1994; 370: 151-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 32Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S. Cwik C. Liu E.T. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Recent results obtained on the IL-2R and (in less detail) the IL-4R system indicate an interaction of JAK-3 with cγ and strongly suggest a binding of JAK-1 to IL-4Rα (33Boussiotis V.A. Barber D.L. Nakarai T. Freeman G.J. Gribben J.G. Bernstein G.M. D'Andrea A.D. Ritz J. Nadler L.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 34Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C.M. Friedman M. Berg M. McVicar D.W. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Goldman A.S. Schmalstieg F.C. Ihle J.N. O'Shea J.J. Leonard W.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 35Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Minami Y. Liu Z.-J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Both kinases become phosphorylated as a consequence of ligand-induced receptor activation, whereas only JAK-3 is activated. The stoichiometry of the IL-4 receptor complex has not yet been definitely settled. By functionally expressing a hIL-4Rα/hG-CSFR chimera we anticipated a system yielding information about oligomerization processes during hIL-4 receptor activation, in particular about a possible involvement of hIL-4Rα homodimerization. G-CSFR has been shown to homodimerize upon ligand binding, and moreover, the intracellular domain of G-CSFR was used experimentally to transmit a homodimerization signal of a fused extracellular human growth hormone receptor domain into FDC-P1 cells, resulting in sustained human growth hormone-dependent cell proliferation (12Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar, 18Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). The failure of hIL-4 to maintain sustained growth of FDC-4G cells makes a participation of hIL-4Rα homodimerization in formation of the activated hIL-4R appear very unlikely. Together with our chemical cross-linking data it rather confirms the notion that hIL-4 binding leads to an assembly of hIL-4Rα and cγ (here: murine cγ) into a functional receptor complex, an event which is fundamental for signaling. FDC-4G cells show a similar growth behavior in response to mIL-4 and hIL-4 regarding both intensity and duration. Since hIL-4 operates by means of a hybrid receptor system laking the intracellular domain of hIL-4Rα, this raises the question what common intracellular mechanisms are involved in both cases. The cytoplasmic portion of G-CSF receptor shares a membrane-proximal box of sequence homology with both IL-4Rα and IL-2 receptor β subunit (36Murakami M. Narazaki M. Hibi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). For IL-2Rβ, a stretch of amino acids comprising this motif was found to be essential for interaction with JAK-1 kinase (32Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S. Cwik C. Liu E.T. Ihle J.N. Nature. 1994; 370: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). As for IL-4, IL-2, and several other cytokines, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat family members and other proteins has also been observed upon G-CSF-induced activation of its cognate receptor, probably due to JAK kinase activity (37Matsuda T. Hirano T. Blood. 1994; 83: 3457-3461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent work indicates that stimulation of FDC-4G cells by hIL-4 results in phosphorylation of the 4G hybrid receptor. 4A. Lischke and K. Friedrich, unpublished results. We suggest that by interacting with their extracellular domains, hIL-4 brings the intracellular domains of 4G receptor and mcγ into close proximity to each other. The serine-rich membrane proximal sequence motif of the hG-CSFR component is associated with a JAK kinase which in turn activates mcγ-associated JAK-3 kinase. As a result of this event a mitogenic signal is generated by the artificial receptor subunit combination which resembles that one produced by the natural murine IL-4R complex. We finally used the FDC-4G line as a cellular read-out system allowing for the molecular analysis of interactions between hIL-4, hIL-4Rα, and cγ in the course of receptor activation, thereby extending previous mutational analysis of hIL-4 (5Kruse N. Tony H.-P. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Kruse N. Shen B.-J. Arnold S. Tony H.-P. Müller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The most surprising results of this study were obtained when the proliferative response of FDC-4G cells and TF-1 cells to signaling-deficient hIL-4 variants were compared. These data indicate that the participation of human or murine cγ in the formation of a productive hIL-4/hIL-4 receptor complex is not equivalent. Instead, requirements of hcγ and mcγ, respectively, for the integrity of particular amino acid side chains in helix D of hIL-4 differ in a characteristic fashion. Variant hIL-4 R121D displayed no detectable biological activity on murine FDC-4G cells expressing a hIL-4Rα/G-CSFR chimera and behaved as an antagonist in competition experiments with wild type hIL-4. In contrast, when assayed with the human cell line, it showed about 40% wild type activity. For variant hIL-4 Y124D an almost reciprocal activity profile in the two cell types was observed. Although proliferation of FDC-4G cells was induced by Y124D to an extent indistinguishable from that of wild type hIL-4, the variant cytokine had only a minimal residual activity on TF-1. It is interesting to note that the two most critical amino acids of hIL-4 for signaling in FDC-4G and TF-1 cells, respectively (Arg121and Tyr124), are separated by one helical turn of helix D, which results in an aligned spatial location of their side chains (38Müller T. Dieckmann T. Sebald W. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 8 A). Since sequence comparison reveals a shortened C terminus by four amino acids of mIL-4 compared with hIL-4 (Ref. 7Morrison B.W. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11957-11963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, see also Fig. 8 B), it is tempting to speculate that the interaction interface of mIL-4 is shifted by one helical turn equivalent. It has been reported that deletion of the three C-terminal amino acids of mIL-4 result in a variant cytokine with antagonist properties (7Morrison B.W. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11957-11963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the light of the findings presented in this study, it would be interesting to analyze mIL-4 Q116D and mIL-4 Y119D, the murine homologs of hIL-4 R121D and hIL-4 Y124D, respectively, with regard to their activity on murine cells. We cannot exclude the possibility that murine and human cγ have different functional characteristics in IL-4 signaling. In the IL-2 receptor system, human IL-2Rβγ heterodimer is capable of binding IL-2, whereas murine βγ is not (39Kumaki S. Kondo M. Takeshita T. Asao H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies on the interaction of IL-4 and cγ are important to address whether such differences also exist regarding the IL-4R. The skillful technical assistance of C.

https://openalex.org/W2050287005,"The kinetics of CO geminate recombination in cytochrome P450cam are studied at room temperature subsequent to laser photolysis. The geminate rebinding kinetics of P450 are strongly affected by the presence of the camphor substrate. We observe a ∼2% geminate yield for substrate-bound P450 and a 90% geminate yield when the substrate is absent. The drastic difference in the geminate kinetics suggests that the presence of camphor significantly alters the CO rebinding and escape rates by modifying the heme pocket environment. Two geminate phases and two bimolecular rebinding phases in the substrate free protein were observed, which could arise from slowly interconverting protein conformations. When the temperature or the viscosity of the solution is changed, the fast geminate rate remains the same, whereas the slow geminate rate and the two bimolecular rates change significantly. The geminate rebinding yield of substrate-free P420 is smaller than that of substrate free P450, but its geminate rebinding rate is faster. This demonstrates that in the absence of substrate, CO escapes from the pocket of P420 much more rapidly than from P450 and suggests that the distal pocket environment is altered in the P420 form.

Cytochromes P450 are globular heme protein enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of various xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. Cytochrome P450cam, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of camphor, is obtained from Pseudomonas putida and has been widely studied as a model for P450 monoxygenases using many techniques (1Gunsalus I.C. Meeks J.R. Lipscomb J.D. Debrunner P. Münck E. Hayaishi O. Molecular Mechanisms of Oxygen Activation. Academic Press, Yew York1974: 559-613Google Scholar, 2Dawson J.H. Sono M. Chem.

The three-dimensional structure of P450cam in both substrate-free and -bound forms has been determined by x-ray studies (5Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Krant J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16122-16130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5314-5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). One important result is that the heme active site of P450cam is deeply buried inside the protein, and there is no obvious access channel for substrate and diatomic ligand binding. This means that the protein must undergo structural fluctuations or interconversions, which allow the passage of small molecules to the active site. Recent photoacoustic calorimetry studies (7Di Primo C. Hui Bon Hoa G. Douzou P. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5361-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that the presence or absence of the camphor substrate in P450cam significantly affects the dynamics of the protein. The camphor evidently leaves the heme pocket when CO is dissociated (7Di Primo C. Hui Bon Hoa G. Douzou P. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5361-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wells A.V. Li P. Champion P.M. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which suggests that important conformational changes within the protein take place upon photolysis that may be linked to the opening of an access channel. Camphor-free P450 has a high CO affinity, but when camphor binds, the CO affinity is reduced by a factor of 10, and the association rate is slowed by about 2 orders of magnitudes (9Peterson J.A. Griffin B.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Infrared experiments (10O'Keefe D.H. Ebel R.E. Peterson J.A. Maxwell J.C. Caughey W.S.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12855-12862Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reveal that substrate-free P450cam-CO has a broad and slightly structured CO-stretching band. The multiple signals indicate that P450cam exists in a dynamic equilibrium involving several conformational substates. Binding of camphor or camphor analogues strongly influences this equilibrium (11Jung C. Hui Bon Hoa G. Schröder K. Simon M. Doucet J.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12855-12862Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and analogous resonance Raman experiments have demonstrated significant differences in the Fe-CO vibrational frequencies as a function of substrate (8Wells A.V.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have also shown that the presence of camphor substrate in P420 (the inactive form of P450) samples has little effect on the Raman spectra in the oxidized, reduced, or CO-bound states. The P420 heme appears to be in equilibrium between a high-spin, five-coordinate form and a low-spin six-coordinate form in both the ferric and ferrous oxidation states (8Wells A.V. Li P. Champion P.M. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the ferric state of P420, H2O remains as a heme ligand, whereas alterations of the protein tertiary structure lead to a significant reduction in affinity for Cys357 thiolate binding to the heme iron. In ferrous P420, H2O and histidine are the most likely axial ligands (8Wells A.V. Li P. Champion P.M. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This evidence indicates that the heme environment and the camphor-binding site of P420 differ significantly from that of P450. It is likely that the altered tertiary protein structure leads to changes in key rate constants associated with diatomic ligand binding to the heme as well as substrate binding to the protein. The reaction cycle of P450cam basically includes four stable intermediates (1Gunsalus I.C. Meeks J.R. Lipscomb J.D. Debrunner P. Münck E. Hayaishi O. Molecular Mechanisms of Oxygen Activation. Academic Press, Yew York1974: 559-613Google Scholar, 14Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5399-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The initial state is the substrate-free cytochrome, P450mo(ferric iron, spin 1/2). Upon binding the camphor substrate, a heme-ligated H2O molecule is expelled to form the high-spin state, P450mos (ferric iron, spin 5/2). When the heme iron is reduced to P450mrs (ferrous iron, spin 2), dioxygen can bind to the heme forming P450mO2rs. Subsequent to the input of a second electron, the oxygenated intermediate decays with rapid product formation. To better understand the catalytic process, we have studied the kinetics of diatomic ligand binding to P450cam in the presence and absence of the camphor substrate. Such studies are sensitive to the heme environment as well as the protein structure and dynamics. In this investigation we explore the ligand binding kinetics of CO to P450. We utilize CO because it serves as a stable “reporter group” that allows easy comparison to other heme protein systems (MbCO, HbCO) that have been extensively studied (15Frauenfelder H. Sligar S.G.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8673-8677Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the nanosecond geminate recombination of CO to P450 has not been reported previously. Such observations are crucial for a determination of the fundamental kinetic rate constants of heme proteins (18Henry E.R. Sommer J.H. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) (e.g. ligand entry to the active site, kin; ligand escape to the solvent, kout; and ligand binding to the heme, kBA) as shown below for the three-state model. P450CO⇄kBAkLP450:CO⇄kinkoutP450 + COMODEL 1 The fundamental rate constants can be calculated from the experimentally determined geminate rebinding rate (kg), geminate amplitude (Ig), and bimolecular rate (ks), kBA=Igkg,kin=ks/Ig,kout=kg(1−Ig)(Eq. 1) under the conditions that kout, kBA ≫ kin, kin = k′in [CO] with [CO] ≫ [P450], and the photolysis/off rate, kL ∼ 0 when t > 0. In this work, we present the CO geminate rebinding kinetics of P450 and P420, both in the presence and absence of substrate and in different glycerol/buffer solutions at different temperatures. P450mos was generated and purified from P. putida as described previously (28Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). High purity P420mos was prepared by exposure of P450mos to a pressure of 2 kbar at room temperature for 1-2 h (29Hui Bon Hoa G. Di Primo C. Dondaine I. Sligar S.G. Gunsalus I.C. Douzou P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Martinis, S. A., 1990, Ph.D. thesis, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL.Google Scholar). Substrate-bound samples contained 0.4-1.0 m M camphor and 100 m M KCl. Concentrated frozen samples were thawed and diluted in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0-7.2. The substrate-free protein P450mowas obtained by passing a concentrated P450mos sample through a small column of Sephadex G-25 which contained the same buffer. A cold centrifuge was used to reconcentrate the sample. The purity of the P450mopreparation was determined by checking the absorbance ratio at 416.5 nm (the Soret peak of P450mo) relative to 390 nm (the Soret peak of P450mos). In our experiments, the ratio was ≥ 2.7 which indicates the purification of P450mowas better than 97%. P450mowas reduced to P450mrby anaerobically adding a small amount of concentrated sodium dithionite solution (∼20:1 with respect to protein concentration). P450mCOr was obtained by bubbling CO gas slowly through the P450mrsample for 20 min. When preparing glycerol/buffer mixed samples, a longer gas equilibration time (∼1 h) was used. All the preparation procedures were carried out at 0−2°C, in order to maintain the sample (8Wells A.V. Li P. Champion P.M. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). CO solubility changes as a function of temperature (31Wleth V.L. Seidell A. Solubilities of Inorganic and Metal Organic Compounds. Vol. 1. D. Van Nostrand Co., New York1940: 217-219Google Scholar) and glycerol concentration (32McKinnie R.E. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8928-8932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The changes of the concentration of CO as a function of the temperature in 75% glycerol were treated as proportional to the change in water. The CO concentrations used for the samples at different temperatures and solutions are listed in Table I. These concentrations are used to find the bimolecular CO association rates, kon.Table I:The kinetics of CO rebinding to P450 and P420All the data are least squares fit using Equation 2. Since the time resolution is limited, the kinetics faster than 10 ns are not observed. This leads to 10–20– “missing” amplitude as determined by the ▵A(O) obtained from the equilibrium CO bound and unbound species. We estimate that the cumulative effect of all sources of uncertainty in the geminate rebinding give an error in the range of 10–20– for amplitudes and 20–50– for rates.

We estimate that the cumulative effect of all sources of uncertainty in the geminate rebinding give an error in the range of 10–20– for amplitudes and 20–50– for rates. The details of the flash photolysis experiment have been presented elsewhere (19Tian W.D. Sage J.T. rajer V. Champion P.M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1992; 68: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The sample was photolyzed by the 532-nm line of a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (10-ns pulse width) and the kinetics of the ligand rebinding was probed by an argon-pumped cw dye laser. The absorption signal was monitored by a highly linear photomultiplier circuit and averaged about 103times using a 350-MHz digital oscilloscope. The voltage signal was subsequently converted to a differential absorbance between the bound and unbound states, using Δ A(t) = log(V(t)/ V(0)), where V(0) and V(t) are proportional to sample transmittance before and after photolysis. The quantity Δ A is renormalized to give the surviving unbound population, N(t) = Δ A(t)/Δ A(0), where Δ A(0) is the absorbance difference at t = 0 as determined from equilibrium measurements on bound and unbound samples (or from their relative extinction coefficients). Fitting functions are allowed to have a variable normalization, N0, and the deviation of N0from unity, which is a measure of the goodness of fit at t = 0, is considered in the assessment of the fitting function's validity. If N0lies outside the range 1.0 ± 0.2, the fit is considered unreliable, since non-equilibrium relaxation processes are unlikely to alter the t = 0 absorbance changes by more than ± 20% (19Tian W.D. Sage J.T. rajer V. Champion P.M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1992; 68: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Since the P450mrsample is less stable at high temperature, most experiments were carried out at 275 K. Special anaerobic cells were used to maintain CO gas pressure, and the sample temperature was stabilized with a circulating bath (±1 K). The optical spectra of the samples were taken before and after addition of CO and at the conclusion of the experiment to check the quality of the sample and to determine the absolute difference between the P450mCOr and P450mrabsorbance (Δ A(0)). Photoexcitation of each heme in the sample volume is assured by use of a polarization scrambler, counter propagating beam geometry, and sufficient pumping energy (10 mJ/pulse). Due to the limited time resolution of the instruments, kinetics faster than 10 ns are not observed. This leads to 10-20%“missing” amplitude, as determined by the expected equilibrium absorption change (Δ A(0)) between P450mCOr and P450mrat the probe wavelength. It should be noted that this methodology does not account for the possibility of spectral evolution caused by nonequilibrium protein relaxation (19Tian W.D. Sage J.T. rajer V. Champion P.M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1992; 68: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); however, such effects are expected to be relatively small (5%). Another source of uncertainty in the geminate kinetics arises from radiofrequency noise from the Nd:YAG laser. This effect has been limited by shielding and grounding the instruments and by subtracting the background response, with the probe light blocked, from the signal. The remaining noise still affects the accuracy of the measurement at the level of ≤ 1% near 10−7 s. The difference between the absorption spectra of the CO-bound and unbound states of P450 (P420) can be utilized in flash photolysis experiments to optically study the kinetics. The left panel of Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of camphor-free P450 and P420 in both the CO-bound and unbound states. In the flash photolysis experiments, CO is dissociated from the heme during the 10-ns photolysis pulse. Some CO molecules remain in the heme pocket and rebind to the heme, which gives rise to the geminate rebinding kinetics. The remaining CO molecules diffuse out of the heme pocket into the solvent. On longer time scales CO rebinds from the solvent giving rise to the bimolecular rebinding kinetics. The time course of CO binding measured at 447 nm was best resolved using two geminate (CO concentration-independent) exponential phases and two bimolecular (CO concentration-dependent) phases. In the right panel of Fig. 1, we present the kinetics of P450mCOr in 50% glycerol solution at 275 K. The solid line is a fit with two exponential geminate phases, the dash-dot line is a fit with one exponential geminate phase, and the dashed line is a fit with a “stretched” exponential geminate phase (e-(kt)β), where β is held fixed at 0.5. 1When β is reduced to 0.25 (dotted line) the fit improves between 10−7 to 10−6 s, but the absorbance normalization factor, N0, deviated significantly from unity (N0= 6.69). This signals that the fitting function is overshooting the zero time point determined by Δ A(0) and N(0) = 1. Such effects lead to a gross overestimate of the geminate amplitude at the expense of the bimolecular amplitude. The chi-square for the β = 0.25 fit is a factor of 3 better than for β = 0.5, but still a factor of 5 worse than the bi-exponential fits. The bi-exponential also gives a superior fit at the zero time point (N0= 1.18) compared with the β = 0.5 case (N0= 1.7). Since the two exponentials give a better description of the geminate phase, the CO rebinding kinetics were fit using, N(t)/N0=Ig1e−kg1t+Ig2e−kg2t+Is1e−ks1t+Is2e−ks2t(Eq. 2) where N(t) is the normalized (▵A(t)/▵A(O)) surviving population of unbound P450. Ig1,2 and kg1,2 represent the geminate rebinding amplitudes and rates, and Is1,2 and ks1,2 refer to the bimolecular amplitudes and rates. N0 is a scaling factor that allows comparison of the fit with the expected equilibrium absorbance change at time 0 (N0 = 1 ifthere is perfect agreement between the fit extrapolated to t = 0 and the expected equilibrium absorbance change). Earlier work on P450 CO rebinding kinetics evidently did not have sufficient signal to noise to reveal the two bimolecular phases. One simple explanation for the two geminate phases and two bimolecular rebinding rates observed for P450mCOr is that there are two conformations having different CO affinity. 2The possibility that the slow bimolecular phase of P450mCOr is due to camphor-bound P450mCOrs contamination in the sample cannot be completely ruled out, because its slow bimolecular rate is dominant and similar to the value of k2observed for P450mCOrs. The level of P450mCOrs contamination would need to scale roughly with the amplitude of the slow bimolecular phase of P450mCOr in order to account for this effect. However, contamination by P450mCOrs cannot explain the two phases associated with the P450mCOr geminate kinetics, since its small geminate amplitude would preclude its observation. The two geminate phases could also arise from protein relaxation processes, and further studies, involving isobestic monitoring and double pulse protocols, will be needed to assess this possibility. The differences in affinity could be due to a variety of conformationally controlled factors, ranging from distal pocket steric effects to heme geometry and iron spin state. Analogous kinetic (19Tian W.D. Sage J.T. rajer V. Champion P.M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1992; 68: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and resonance Raman investigations (33Morikis D. Champion P.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4791-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), as well as double-pulse flash photolysis experiments (34Tian W.D. Sage J.T. Champion P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), have revealed the presence of pH-dependent “open” and “closed” distal pocket protein conformations in myoglobin. The specific conformational changes have recently been confirmed by x-ray crystallography studies (35Quillin M. Brantley R. Johnson K. Olson J. Phillips G. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: A466Google Scholar). The double-pulse protocol (34Tian W.D. Sage J.T. Champion P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) kinetically selects the most rapidly rebinding (open pocket) fraction of the ensemble and determines the time scale for averaging between the open and closed states. The interconversion time scale (1-10 μs) for myoglobin is fast compared with the rate of ligand migration from the solution to the heme pocket (∼10−4 s) so that a time-averaged, single exponential population analysis, rather than a superposition of the open and closed states describes the ligand association and dissociation kinetics of myoglobin. The ligand association kinetics of P450mCOr may also involve different protein conformations (to acknowledge that a variety of factors might affect the kinetics, we refer to them as “fast” and “slow” rebinding conformations), but the interconversion rate may be slower than the CO entry and exit rates. Under this circumstance, two bimolecular rates should be observed. As mentioned above, recent infrared (11Jung C. Hui Bon Hoa G. Schröder K. Simon M. Doucet J.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12855-12862Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and Raman (12Bangcharoenpaurpong O. Champion P.M. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. J. Chem.

In Fig. 2 we present the CO rebinding kinetics of P450mCOrs, P450mCOr, and P420mCOr in pH 7 aqueous solution at 275 K. In the left panel we show the kinetics of the substrate-bound form, P450mCOrs and the substrate-free form P450mCOr monitored at 447 nm. The P450mCOrs data (trace A) show only a very small geminate yield (Ig= 2.5%, kg= 3.6 × 107s−1) with 97% of the amplitude associated with the two bimolecular phases (Is1 = 11%, ks1= 240 s−1, Is2= 86%, ks2= 26 s−1). On the other hand, the P450mCOr data (trace B) reveal a significant geminate yield (Ig1 = 91%, kg1 = 4.8 × 107s−1; Ig2 = 3.6%, kg2 = 6.9 × 106s−1) along with two bimolecular phases (see Table I). The bimolecular rates of P450mCOrs and P450mCOr agree reasonably well with other literature values (9Peterson J.A. Griffin B.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Shiro Y. Kato M. Iizuka T. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8673-8677Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The significant difference in the geminate kinetics between P450mCOrs and P450mCOr indicates that the presence or absence of substrate not only affects the coordination and spin state of the ferric heme iron, but also significantly changes the heme environment in the reduced state. The observation of significant geminate rebinding in the absence of substrate explains the early work of Shimada et al. (22Shimada H. Iizuka T. Ueno R. Ishimura Y. FEBS Lett. 1979; 98: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) which found that the quantum yield of CO photodissociation was only ∼6% for P450mCOr and ∼100% for P450mCOrs. It also supports the observation that the CO affinity of camphor-bound P450mCOrs is 10 times weaker than camphor-free P450mCOr (9Peterson J.A. Griffin B.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), primarily because of a decreased heme binding rate (∼factor 7), kBA, and an increased CO escape rate (∼factor 20) in P450mCOrs that reduces the geminate amplitude (Ig= kBA/(kBA+ kout)) and, thus, the probability of ligand binding when CO enters the heme pocket. The right panel of Fig. 2 shows the kinetics of P420mCOr (the pressure inactivated form of P450), which was monitored at both 420 nm (C) and 447 nm (D). At 420 nm (the peak absorption of P420mCOr), the kinetics shows a geminate yield of about 60% (Ig1 = 53%, Ig2 = 11%) with geminate rates that are significantly faster than for P450mCOr (kg1 = 1.5 × 108s−1, kg2 = 2.7 × 107s−1). This indicates that CO escapes from the pocket of P420 3The absorption and resonance Raman spectra do not show a difference between the camphor-bound and camphor-free P420 (8Wells A.V. Li P. Champion P.M. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), so we might expect that the kinetics of these two forms should be similar. In fact, we found that the addition of substrate does not affect the kinetics of CO rebinding to P420 (not shown). This indicates that if cytochrome P420 binds substrate, it has little affect on heme ligation state and heme environment. As a result, CO escape from P420 is effectively independent of the presence of substrate. much more rapidly than from P450 (see Table II) and suggests that the distal pocket environment is altered in the P420 form. The bimolecular phase of P420mCOr could not be fit with only two exponentials, so a stretched exponential (Ise(kst)β) was used. The fitting result, with β fixed at 0.5, is Is= 36%, ks = 1.8 × 103s−1. The nonexponential behavior may be due to the fact that “P420” is actually composed of a heterogeneous mixture of slowly interconverting conformational states. Raman spectra support this suggestion and indicate that the P420 heme is in equilibrium between a high-spin five-coordinate form and low-spin six-coordinate form (8Wells A.V. Li P. Champion P.M. Martinis S.A. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4384-4393Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Table II:The fundamental rate constants of P450 and P420All the fundamental rates are calculated from Equation 1. Uncertainties in the fundamental rates can be estimated as described in Table I. All the fundamental rates are calculated from Equation 1. Uncertainties in the fundamental rates can be estimated as described in Table I. In order to compare the kinetics of P420mCOr to P450mCOr, trace D shows the N(t) data for P420mCOr after scaling by their relative extinction coefficient changes at 447 nm (see Fig. 1). In addition to having a relatively small absorption change, the signal also undergoes a change in sign for t < 10−3 s. This latter observation suggests that protein relaxation takes place in P420 following photolysis (i.e. in analogy to myoglobin (19Tian W.D. Sage J.T. rajer V. Champion P.M. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1992; 68: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 36Lambright D.G. Balasubramanian S. Boxer S.G. Chem. Phys. 1991; 158: 249-260Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), at short times following photolysis, the Soret band of P420mris red shifted or broadened relative to its equilibrium value.) More importantly, for a sample that is a mixture of P450mCOr (35%) and P420mCOr (65%), the kinetics (trace E) can be seen to be a combination of the kinetic traces (traces B and D), with proper weighting. These results demonstrate that the two geminate phases and two bimolecular phases of P450mCOr monitored at 447 nm (trace B) are not the result of P420mCOr contamination of the sample. In Fig. 3, we present the kinetics of P450mCOr in pH 7.2 (75% glycerol) solutions as a function of temperature. When the temperature decreases from 293 to 263 K, the amplitude of the fast geminate phase increases by a factor of 1.23, but the rate remains the same (see Table I). On the other hand, the corresponding changes of the slow geminate rate kg2 and two bimolecular rates (ks1 and ks2) are much larger over the same temperature range (Table I). All the least squares fitting parameters from Equation 2 are listed in Table I. The fundamental rates for ligand entry, exit, and binding to the heme can be calculated using Equation 1. The rates associated with the fast bimolecular and geminate rebinding kinetics are used to calculate the fundamental rates associated with the fast protein structure, whereas the slower pair of geminate and bimolecular parameters are used to find the rates associated with the slow structure. Table II presents the fundamental rates calculated for both fast (f) and slow (s) states of P450mCOr in 75% glycerol at different temperatures. 4Under the assumption that the slow bimolecular phase reflects P450mCOrs contamination, the kinetics of P450mCOr contain two geminate and one bimolecular phase. The results for the fast state in Table II still hold approximately, because I2, associated with the slow geminate phase of P450mCOr, is much smaller than I1. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the Arrhenius fit to the fundamental rates for the fast rebinding conformation. The ratio of the rates in the fast and slow states are kBAf/kBAs ∼ 6-30, koutf/kouts ∼ 6-8, kinf/kins ∼ 16-20 over the temperature range 293-263 K. Surprisingly, the value of kBAf for the fast state does not appear to change significantly with temperature. This suggests a very small barrier for ligand binding at the heme in comparison with the slow state. Compared with the weak temperature dependence of kBAf, koutf, and kinf are much more sensitive to temperature. The Arrhenius barriers are found to be: HBAf ∼ 0 kJ/mol, Houtf ∼ 27kJ/mol, and Hinf ∼ 33kJ/mol. We note that, due to experimental error and the small amplitudes associated with the kinetic response of the slow state, Table II only contains estimates for the fast state barriers. The significant increase of the rates in the fast state indicates the possibility of protein conformational control of diatomic ligand binding in cytochrome P450. The time course of CO rebinding to P450mCOr in aqueous solution at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 4. The inset shows the expanded bimolecular process. When the temperature increases from 273 to 293 K, the amplitude of the fast geminate phase decreases ∼4%, the rate increases ∼5%, and the slow geminate rate increases ∼20% (see Table I). On the other hand, the bimolecular rates (ks1and ks2) increase significantly (factors of 2.5 and 3) over the same temperature range. All the least squares fitting parameters from Equation 2 are listed in Table I. The fundamental rates, analyzed using Equation 1, are listed in Table II and follow a trend that is similar to the kinetics of P450mCOr in 75% glycerol solution (i.e. kBAf is nearly independent of temperature, whereas koutf and kinf change significantly). A systematic difference in the rebinding kinetics of P450mCOr in aqueous solution and glycerol/buffer mixtures is observed by comparing Figs. 3 and 4. As the solution changes from aqueous to 75% glycerol at 273 K, the fast geminate amplitudes decrease from 92 to 77%, whereas the slow geminate amplitude increases from 3 to 10%. 5The slow geminate amplitude increases continuously as the percentage of glycerol in the solution increases from 0, 25, 50, and 75% (not shown). On the other hand, the geminate rates do not change significantly and the bimolecular rates change by factors ∼2 (see Table I). The glycerol-dependent results show that the kinetics are not dramatically sensitive to solvent environment. This indicates that, unlike the camphor substrate, glycerol has no major effect on the structural features of the heme pocket that determine the geminate amplitude and rebinding kinetics. In summary, the CO geminate rebinding kinetics of P450 and P420 were observed for the first time and experiments as a function of temperature and glycerol/water buffer have been carried out. P450mCOrs and P450mCOr have drastically different geminate rebinding kinetics, which indicates that substrate plays an very important role in the structure/function relationships that govern the dynamics of diatomic ligand binding and release. Such effects may occur via alterations of the heme pocket that affect the stability of CO within the pocket (this might involve displacement of water molecules, or direct steric interactions, for example). The two geminate and two bimolecular CO kinetic phases of P450mCOr suggest two conformational states of the protein, each one with a different CO affinity. The specific structural changes associated with the fast and slow states are not yet clear. One possibility is that they correspond to conformational interconversions of the protein that are linked to (camphor) substrate binding, which also affect the diatomic ligand entry and exit rates in addition to the rate of binding at the heme. In analogy to myoglobin (34Tian W.D. Sage J.T. Champion P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), these states may correspond to slowly interconverting open and closed substrate binding pockets. The open state has significantly faster fundamental rates (kBA, kin, kout) than the closed state, which indicates that the protein conformation can control ligand binding to the heme as well as its motion between the solvent and the heme pocket. The geminate kinetics of P450mCOr were affected by changes in the temperature and viscosity, but major structural changes were not apparent. This indicates that the structure of the P450mCOr heme pocket is stable to such perturbations. In comparison with P450, the P420mCOr data show faster geminate rebinding rates and a nonexponential bimolecular rate, suggesting that multiple conformations and an altered heme pocket are associated with the P420 form of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2039151605,"The highly conserved motif of Saccharomyces cerevisiae H+-ATPase 474KGAP has been proposed to participate in the formation of the phosphorylated intermediate during the catalytic cycle (Portillo, F., and Serrano, R. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 1793-1798). In addition, Lys-474 is the FITC binding site of the yeast enzyme (Portillo, F. and Serrano, R. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 186, 501-507). We have performed an intragenic suppressor analysis of the K474R mutation to identify the interacting regions involved in these functions. Random in vitro mutagenesis of the K474R allele resulted in seven suppressor (second-site) mutations. One mutation (V396I), located 18 residues away from the Asp-378 residue, which is phosphorylated during catalysis, is allele-specific. This provides genetic evidence of a direct interaction between the KGAP motif and the phosphorylation domain during the catalytic cycle. Three mutations (V484I, V484I/E485K, and E485K/E486K) are located near Lys-474 and may compense the structural alteration introduced by the K474R mutation. Two substitutions at the end of the predicted transmembrane stretch 2 (A165V and V169I/D170N) and another in the predicted ATP binding domain (P536L) may act as allele-nonspecific suppressors, as they are also able to suppress a mutation at the enzyme's carboxyl terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1980864193,"Differential scanning calorimetry was used to study the domain structure and intramolecular interactions of tPA/uPA chimeras. A high temperature transition centered near 90°C was observed upon melting of the tPA/uPA chimera (amino acids 1-274 of tPA and 138-411 of uPA) and its variant lacking the finger and epidermal growth factor-like modules (residues 1-3 and 87-274 of tPA and 138-411 of uPA). Since neither of the two parent plasminogen activators display such a stable structure, one may suggest that a new stabilizing intramolecular interaction occurs in the chimeras.

Both of these proteins are serine proteases that cleave a single Arg-Val peptide bond to convert plasminogen to plasmin. uPA is a 411-amino acid glycoprotein that exists in several molecular forms (1Lijnen H.R.

High molecular weight single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (Pro-Uk) is a Mr= 54,000 zymogen with little or no activity (3Munk G.A.W. Rijken D.C. Fibrinolysis. 1990; 4: 1-9Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Specific cleavage of the Lys158-Ile159peptide bond generates an active two-chain enzyme (HMW-Uk). An active two-chain low molecular weight form (33De Serrano V.S. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3326-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 0) starting from Lys136(LMW-Uk) can be isolated after cleavage with plasmin (4Stump D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol.

Collen D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 88-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast to uPA and most other serine proteases, the single- and two-chain forms of tPA are both enzymatically active. It is well established that the activation of plasminogen by tPA is significantly stimulated by fibrin (5Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol.

Hemostasis Thromb. 1986; 8: 1-18PubMed Google Scholar) and is not dependent on the presence of of the amino-terminal 143 amino acids (4Stump D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17120-17126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).tPA and uPA are mosaic proteins consisting of similar homologous modules that are also found in other plasma proteins. These include an epidermal growth factor-like (E) module, a kringle module (K), and a serine protease module (SP) which are common for the two plasminogen activators. The modular composition of uPA is E-K-SP. tPA has an additional finger module (F) homologous to fibronectin type 1 repeats, and its modular composition can be presented as F-E-K1-K2-SP. While the SP module is responsible for enzymatic activity, all other modules in tPA and uPA are involved in interactions with other proteins and ligands. K2 of tPA carries a so-called lysine binding site (LBS) which is responsible for the interaction with ω-aminocarboxylic acids and is the major site which mediates binding of tPA with fibrin (8Ichinose A.

But these attempts were not as successful as hoped since the created chimeric molecules did not exhibit appreciable affinity for fibrin. Upon module shuffling, one needs to be aware of possible intramolecular domain-domain interactions which might be important for the function. The domain structures and interactions of tPA and uPA have already been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (18Radek J.T. Castellino F.J. Arch. Biochem.

It was shown that in uPA all domains are independent and noninteracting, whereas in tPA, the serine protease domain interacts strongly with the amino-terminal F and/or E domains. In order to explain the failure of the tPA/uPA chimeras to bind fibrin effectively, one must first be sure that all modules are folded properly in their new environment and, second, check whether the interactions between them are preserved. In the present paper, we report the results of such a study of the tPA/uPA chimera and its deletion mutant lacking F and E domains. It is shown that uPA interacts with tPA intermolecularly by means of the LBS of K2 of the latter. This interaction is preserved in the tPA/uPA chimeric molecule where the LBS of tPA is occupied intramolecularly by residues within the Leu144-Lys157sequence of the urokinase moiety. This unnatural filling of the major fibrin binding site explains the poor fibrin affinity of the chimeras.MATERIALS AND METHODSProteinsAll urokinase species were kindly provided by Dr. J.

The ΔFΔE-tPA/uPA deletion mutant (residues 1-3, 87-274 of tPA, and 138-411 of uPA) was obtained by a similar approach (25Nelles L. Lijnen H.R. Van Nuffelen A. Demarsin E. Collen D. Thromb. Haemost. 1990; 64: 53-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody directed against tPA K1 (PAM-2) was purchased from American Diagnostica (Product No. 372). The monoclonal antibody directed against the urokinase A-chain was obtained from Dr. J. Henkin, Abbott Laboratories. ε-Aminocaproic acid (ε-ACA), Tris, glycine, and the proteolytic enzymes subtilisin, trypsin chymotrypsin were obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or higher.Fluorescence Binding MeasurementsFluorescent 32/35K tPA fragment was prepared by labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Protein was dialyzed against 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 9.5, mixed with a 10 M excess of FITC (Sigma), and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Unreacted dye was removed by chromatography on a Sephadex P-10 prepacked column with subsequent dialysis against 0.02 M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS). The degree of labeling was determined optically as described elsewhere (26Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 670: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured from the absorbance at 280 nm, correcting for the contribution from covalently attached fluorescein (26Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 670: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed in TBS at 25°C with an SLM-8000C fluorometer. Concentrated solutions of uPA species were automatically added with a motor-driven syringe to a stirred cuvette containing the FITC-32/35K tPA fragment at 0.1 μM while monitoring the anisotropy at 524 nm with excitation at 493 nm. The resulting concentration-dependent increase in anisotropy (A) was fit to Equation 1: Δ A = Δ Amax [L]/ Kd+ [L] where Kd= dissociation constant and [L] = concentration of free ligand. Δ Amax was treated as a fitting parameter because the amount of protein added was not enough to achieve saturation. Since the concentration of labeled protein was small compared to the Kd, the concentration of free protein was assumed to be equal to the total concentration. Competitive displacement studies were performed by premixing 0.1 μM FITC-32/35K fragment with a sufficient amount of uPA to provide ∼75% saturation and titrating with ε-ACA or the synthetic peptides while measuring the decrease in fluorescence anisotropy.Solid-phase Binding AssaySolid-phase binding was performed in plastic microtiter plates using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Microtiter plate wells were coated with proteins at 3.0 μg/ml in coating buffer (0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 9.5) for 2 h at 37°C or overnight at 4°C. Unbound sites were blocked with 3% nonfat milk in TBS for 1 h at 37°C. After washing with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween), tPA or uPA species were added to the wells at concentrations from 0-5 μM in TBS-Tween. Following a 4-h incubation at 37°C the wells were washed with TBS-Tween. Bound proteins were reacted with either PAM-2 or Uk monoclonal antibodies (1 μg/ml IgG in TBS-Tween in the presence of 3% nonfat milk) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). A 1:1 mixture of 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate with hydroxyperoxide solution (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc.) was added, and the absorbance at 650 nm was measured. The data were analyzed using Equation 1.Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were made as described previously (19Novokhatny V.V. Ingham K.C. Medved L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12994-13002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Novokhatny V. Medved L. Mazar A. Marcotte P. Henkin J. Ingham K. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) at a scan rate of 1°C/min and protein concentrations between 0.4 and 2.2 mg/ml. Deconvolution analysis was performed according to a procedure similar to the recurrent procedure of Freire and Biltonen (28Freire E. Biltonen R.L. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 463-479Crossref Scopus (372) Google Scholar) using software provided by Dr. V. Filimonov (Institute of Protein Research, Pouschino, Russia) as described previously (19Novokhatny V.V. Ingham K.C. Medved L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12994-13002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Novokhatny V. Medved L. Mazar A. Marcotte P. Henkin J. Ingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3878-3885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The homogeneity of all proteins was greater than 95% as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography on Superdex-75 (Pharmacia), and amino-terminal sequence analysis with an HPG1000A Sequencer (Hewlett Packard). Protein concentrations were determined from absorbance at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficients (M−1 cm−1, 280 nm) calculated from the amino acid composition (29Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar). The values are: rtPA, 115,600; ΔFΔE-rtPA, 90,000; 32/35K tPA fragment, 65,400; Pro-Uk and HMW-Uk, 70,000; LMW-Uk, 44,500; tPA/uPA, 110,000; ΔFΔE-tPA/uPA, 93,800.Peptide SynthesisPeptides corresponding to urokinase sequences Leu144-Lys158and Leu144-Phe157were synthesized on a MilliGen 9050 Pep Synthesizer using Fmoc chemistry with pentafluorophenyl amino acid active esters and a polyethylene glycol polystyrene support with a 5-(4′-Fmoc-aminomethyl-3′-5′-dimethoxyphenoxy)valeric acid linker. After synthesis, peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and lyophilized. Concentration of the synthetic peptides was determined by amino acid analysis using a Waters Pico Tag system.RESULTSThe melting properties of tPA and uPA were well characterized earlier at low pH where both proteins were soluble and the denaturation process was highly reversible (19Novokhatny V.V. Ingham K.C. Medved L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12994-13002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Novokhatny V. Medved L. Mazar A. Marcotte P. Henkin J. Ingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3878-3885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These conditions were selected for comparison of the melting behavior of chimeric molecules with that of tPA and uPA. Original endotherms of the tPA/uPA chimera and its ΔFΔE deletion variant are presented in Fig. 1. The dotted lines are simulated curves which were created by the superposition of the melting transitions of the Uk serine protease domain and domains from the A-chain of tPA, taken from the deconvolution analyses presented in Fig. 2 B. Experimental endotherms of the chimeras would be expected to match the simulated curves if no new domain-domain interactions were introduced. However, the experimental curves differ from the simulated ones in the high temperature range. The most prominent difference is the appearance of a new heat-absorption peak centered near 90°C in both chimeric molecules. This becomes especially evident when the deconvoluted excess heat capacity curves for the chimeras (Fig. 2 A) are compared with the corresponding curves for tPA and LMW-Uk (Fig. 2 B). The new transition reflects melting of a single domain since it is well described by one two-state transition. Since neither of the two parent molecules display such a stable structure, one may conclude that one of the domains is stabilized, i.e. we are dealing with a newly acquired interaction unique to the chimeric molecule.FIG. 2Deconvolution of excess heat capacity functions obtained with tPA/uPA and ΔFΔE-tPA/uPA chimeras (A) and tPA and LMW-Uk (B) in 50 m M glycine, pH 3.4. The uneven curves represent the experimental curves, and the smooth curves represent the best fits, i.e. the sums of the component transitions obtained by deconvolution. Individual transitions on the tPA curve were assigned as in Ref. 19Novokhatny V.V. Ingham K.C. Medved L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12994-13002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. A schematic diagram illustrating the modular composition of each species is presented in each panel. The tPA domains are shaded, and the uPA serine protease module is unshaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The total enthalpies of denaturation of the full-length chimera and its deletion variant were found to be equal to 299 and 245 kcal/mol. They are in good agreement with the expected values of 310 and 245 kcal/mol, respectively, obtained by summing up the enthalpies of the constituent transitions in Fig. 2B. The number of transitions in both chimeric molecules revealed by deconvolution analysis correlates with their modular composition. Recall that the SP module actually comprises two independently folded domains and that the transition corresponding to melting of the finger module is not present on these curves since it melts at very high temperature and requires addition of denaturants to be detected (19Novokhatny V.V. Ingham K.C. Medved L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12994-13002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the calorimetric data strongly suggest that all domains are folded properly in the chimeric molecules.Which domain in the chimeric molecule is responsible for the high temperature transition? It is unlikely that the finger or epidermal growth factor-like domains are involved since the high temperature transition occurs in the ΔFΔE derivative as well (Fig. 2 A). Kringle domains are known to be stabilized when their lysine binding sites (LBS) are occupied with lysine or related ligands (30Castellino F.J. Ploplis V.A. Powell J.R. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4778-4782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Novokhatny V.V. Kudinov S.A. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 215-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Novokhatny V.V. Matsuka Y.V. Kudinov S.A. Thromb. Res. 1989; 53: 243-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In particular, the isolated recombinant K2 of tPA, when loaded with ε-ACA, melts at a temperature of 86.5°C, close to that of the high temperature transition found in the chimera molecules (33De Serrano V.S. Castellino F.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3326-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We therefore propose the following hypothesis: in the tPA/uPA chimera the lysine binding site of K2 is occupied intramolecularly by the lysine or arginine residues coming from the urokinase moiety resulting in a strong thermal stabilization of its structure. The most direct way to test this hypothesis is to test directly for binding of LMW-Uk to the A-chain of tPA in solution. For this purpose, the 32/35K A-chain fragment of tPA was labeled with fluorescein and titrated with LMW-Uk while monitoring the change in fluorescence anisotropy. As seen from Fig. 3 A, LMW-Uk indeed interacts with the tPA fragment judging by the hyperbolic increase of anisotropy upon titration. A similar hyperbolic increase in anisotropy of FITC-labeled tPA A-chain was observed upon addition of Pro-Uk (Fig. 3 B). The solid lines on these graphs represent the best fits of the experimental data to Equation 1 to obtain the dissociation constants of 7 μM for LMW-Uk and 2 μM for Pro-Uk. No changes in anisotropy of FITC-labeled 32/35K tPA fragment were observed upon titration with bovine serum albumin and several active site-blocked serine proteases such as thrombin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin used as controls. Thus, fluorescence titration data unequivocally indicate that tPA interacts with uPA in solution.FIG. 3Titration of fluorescein-labeled 32/35K subtilisin fragment of tPA with diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inhibited LMW-Uk (A) and Pro-Uk (B). FITC-32/35K fragment at a concentration of 0.1 μM was titrated with the indicated proteins in TBS at 25°C while monitoring the anisotropy at 524 nm. Curves represent a best fit to Equation 1 to yield the K values indicated on the panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To localize the Uk binding site on tPA, a solid-phase binding assay was utilized. Results are shown on Fig. 4, and the obtained dissociation constants are listed in Table I. Whole tPA, its ΔFΔE deletion mutant, and its A-chain all bind to LMW-Uk coated plates. The continuous best-fit curves in the figure indicate that in all cases the binding is close to saturation and consistent with a single class of binding sites. Since the kringle domains are the only structures common for all three tPA species, they should be responsible for the interaction with uPA. To prove that the LBS is involved in this interaction, a competition assay with ε-ACA was performed. In this assay, a constant amount of tPA (1 μM) was added to the LMW-Uk coated wells containing ε-ACA at varying concentrations. The displacement curve presented in the inset to Fig. 4 reflects the fact that the described reaction could be inhibited by ε-ACA. This strongly suggests that the LBS of K2 is responsible for the interaction with urokinase. Solid-phase binding was also demonstrated in the opposite direction, i.e. with tPA adsorbed on the plate. As seen in Fig. 5, both Pro-Uk and HMW-Uk bind to solid-phase tPA, and, again, this interaction was strongly inhibited by the presence of ε-ACA. Data in the inset show that this process is also inhibited by fluid-phase tPA. Thus, the solid-phase data confirm the fluorescence results that tPA and uPA interact with each other and allow us to conclude that the LBS of tPA mediates this intermolecular interaction.FIG. 4Enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assay. Increasing concentrations of tPA (●), ΔFΔE-tPA (■), and 32/35K subtilisin fragment of tPA (▪) were incubated with microtiter wells coated with LMW-Uk or BSA (⋄) as a control.

https://openalex.org/W2090040887,"A series of monoclonal antibodies against epitopes spanning different domains of apoA-I have been tested for their effects on unesterified cholesterol transfer between low density lipoprotein (LDL) and well-defined homogenous lipoproteins reconstituted with phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and apoA-I (LpA-I). Antibodies 2G11 (reacting between residues 25 and 110), A05 (residues 25-82), A03 (residues 135-140), A44 and r5G9 (residues 149-186), and 4A12 (residues 173-205) significantly inhibit cholesterol transfer from LDL to Lp2A-I while they enhance transfer in the opposite direction, thus causing an increased net transfer to LDL. Most of these monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) also enhance phospholipid transfer to LDL but in a lesser and variable proportion relative to cholesterol. Their epitopes are mainly contained within domains that are predicted to be amphipathic α-helices. In contrast, mAbs 4H1 (residues 2-8), 3G10 (residues 96-121), and 5F6 (residues 116-141) have little or no effect on either cholesterol or phospholipid transfer, and the epitopes for these three mAbs have been shown in earlier studies to be structurally and functionally related. Their immunoreactivity responds similarly to variation in lipoprotein cholesterol content, and the antibodies binding to these sites compete with one another and have similar effects on the cholesterol esterification reaction. Thus, the current results are compatible with the hypothesis that they form an integrated domain with a common function in cholesterol metabolism, possibly as part of a hinge domain. Most mAbs were found to increase significantly the α-helicity of apoA-I in the Lp2A-I immunecomplexes, suggesting that they may increase the stability of the lipid-bound apoA-I. However, not unexpectedly, there is no correlation between the effects of mAbs on α-helicity and their effects on cholesterol or phospholipid transfer since each mAb has a discrete effect on these transfers. These studies demonstrate the specificity of LpA-I particles in cholesterol transport and document the existence of apoA-I domains with different functions in cholesterol transport.

These studies demonstrate the specificity of LpA-I particles in cholesterol transport and document the existence of apoA-I domains with different functions in cholesterol transport. The efflux of unesterified (free) cholesterol from cells to acceptor lipoproteins has been well studied and appears to be satisfactorily explained by the mechanism of aqueous diffusion (for review, see Ref. 1Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However apolipoprotein A-I-containing lipoproteins (LpA-I) 1The abbreviations used are:LpA-Ilipoprotein containing apoA-ImAbmonoclonal antibodyPCphosphatidylcholinePOPC1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholineLDLlow density lipoproteinHDLhigh density lipoprotein. with a preβ migration are the most avid acceptors of cellular cholesterol, and the specificity of these lipoproteins in this pathway also suggests that greater binding (or affinity) of cholesterol with these lipoproteins provides a directionality for cholesterol flux (2Castro G.R. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 3Francone O.L. Gurakar A. Fielding C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7066-7072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the transfer of cholesterol between lipoproteins appears to proceed with a different specificity as demonstrated by the transfer from LDL to plasma lipoproteins, which is first channeled through α-migrating lipoproteins rather than preβ-lipoproteins (4Miida T. Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10469-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 5Huang Y. Eckardstein A.v. Assmann G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed preferential binding affinity of preβ LpA-I for cholesterol depends on the type of donor and acceptor involved (the transfer interface). Such a selectivity of acceptors and interfacial systems suggest that a complex mechanism is involved, which may include both an activation step, possibly a desorption step as suggested by McLean and Phillips (6McLean L.R. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2893-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) or a unimolecular activation event, perhaps the movement of cholesterol to a more exposed (hydrated) position, and a collision step (7Steck T.L. Kezdy F.J. Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13023-13031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) characterized by a directionality specific for each interface, such as cells to lipoproteins and lipoproteins to lipoproteins. lipoprotein containing apoA-I monoclonal antibody phosphatidylcholine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine low density lipoprotein high density lipoprotein. We propose that the specificity of the collision at the interface must depend on an apolipoprotein specificity that implicates the interaction of defined and possibly different domains with each donor and acceptor system. The complementarity of such domains, which may depend on charge (8Pattnaik N.M. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2782-2786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jonas A. Covinsky K.E. Sweany S.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3508-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), would differ as a function of the interface involved. This hypothesis can be tested using monoclonal antibodies against apoA-I as probes to modify the interactions between the LpA-I and other cholesterol-carrying structures. We have selected LDL and discoidal LpA-I particles as a simpler and well defined system (10Lund-Katz S. Hammerschlag B. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2964-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1130-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Bittman R.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), compared with the cell-lipoprotein interface, and have used a selection of mAbs reacting with epitopes distributed over most of apoA-I sequence (15Marcel Y.L. Provost P.R. Koa H. Raffai E. Dac N.V. Fruchart J.-C. Rassart E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3644-3653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to test the directionality of the interaction between these two types of lipoproteins. The results obtained in this study are compatible with a concept of directional specificity in the interaction of lipoproteins but more importantly demonstrate the involvement of specific domains of apoA-I in the control of cholesterol binding and desorption. However the unidirectional effect of the active mAbs on cholesterol transfer and their increase of the α-helicity of several Lp2A-I immunecomplexes suggest that the action of mAbs in cholesterol transfer is more complex than a simple steric hindrance and is probably related to specific conformational modifications. Plasma LDL was prepared from pooled plasma from normolipemic volunteers by sequential flotation ultracentrifugation as described previously (16Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The LDL fraction (KBr density = 1.020-1.063 g/ml) of plasma was dialyzed against Tris-EDTA buffer containing 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m M EDTA, and 1 m M NaN3and stored at 4°C under N2for up to 2 weeks. The HDL fraction (KBr density = 1.063-1.21 g/ml) of plasma was delipidated, resolubilized in 6 M guanidine-HCl, and chromatographed on two serial Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration columns (100 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated with 3 M guanidine in 10 m M Tris buffer, pH 8.0, to isolate apoA-I protein (17Brewer Jr., H.B. Ronan R. Meng M. Bishop C. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Reconstituted HDL was prepared from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) (Sigma), cholesterol (Sigma), and apoA-I at initial molar ratio of 120:6:1 or 88:44:1 by cholate dialysis following previously published procedures (18Matz C.E.

Homogeneous lipoprotein particles containing two, three, or four apoA-I molecules (Lp2A-I, −3A-I, or −4A-I) were purified by gel filtration on two serial agarose Bio-Gel 5 M columns (95 × 2.5 cm) (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with Tris-EDTA buffer. The Lp2A-I (9.6 nm), Lp3A-I (13.4 nm), and Lp4A-I (17.0 nm) particles were purified from the above reconstituted HDL at an initial molar ratio of 120:6:1, and Lp2A-I (7.8 nm), Lp2A-I (8.6 nm), and Lp3A-I (10.8 nm) particles were purified from the above reconstituted HDL at an initial molar ratio of 88:44:1. The Lp2A-I (10.2 nm) particles were prepared according to Sparks et al. (20Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at an initial POPC/cholesterol/apoA-I molar ratio of 150:6:1. The characteristics of these particles were well defined and reported in previous studies (21Calabresi L. Meng Q.-H. Castro G.R. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6477-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Size characterization of LpA-I particles was done by native gradient gel electrophoresis using high molecular calibration kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with reference globular proteins (thyroglobulin, 17.0 nm; ferritin, 12.2 nm; lactate dehydrogenase, 8.16 nm; and albumin, 7.1 nm) as described by others (22Williams P.T. Krauss R.M. Nichols A.W. Vranizan K.M. Wood P.D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 31: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The number of apoA-I molecules/LpA-I particles was determined by the cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate technique (23Swaney J.B. O'Brien K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of lipoproteins was measured by Lowry assay (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that of cholesterol and POPC were measured by enzymatic kits (Boehringer Mannheim). To measure cholesterol transfer from LDL to LpA-I, LDL was prelabeled with [1,2-3H]cholesterol ([3H]cholesterol) (DuPont NEN) using 10 μCi/100 μg LDL protein. Briefly, 10 μCi of [3H]cholesterol solution in toluene was dried to completion under N2onto the wall of a glass tube. LDL protein (100 μg) diluted to 500 ml with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline-EDTA was added into the [3H]cholesterol-coated tube and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The incubation mixture was dialyzed against 20 m M Tris buffer, pH 7.7, containing 150 m M NaCl (TBS) in which all cholesterol transfer assays were carried out. The procedure to label LpA-I with [3H]cholesterol is essentially the same as above. To monitor the POPC transfer between lipoproteins, the donor particles were incubated with 10 μCi of [oleoyl-1-14C]POPC ([14C]POPC) (DuPont NEN) coated on the glass wall as described above. To monitor the potential apoA-I movement during the process of cholesterol transfer assay, apoA-I in LpA-I were iodinated by Iodo-Bead technique (Pierce). Antibodies 4H1, 3G10, and 5F6 were prepared in our laboratory (25Marcel Y.L. Jewer C. Vezina C. Milthorp P. Weech P.K. J. Lipid. Res. 1987; 28: 768-777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies 2G11 and 4A12, characterized by Petit et al. (26Petit E. Ayrault-Jarrier M. Pastier D. Robin H. Polonovski J. Aragon I. Hervaud E. Pau B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 919: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), were purchased from Sanofi (Paris, France). Antibodies A05, AO3, A44, and r5G9 are a generous gift of Dr. Fruchart (SERLIA, Institut Pasteur, Lille). The apoA-I sequence forming the epitopes for each of these mAbs is indicated in Table I and was previously delineated in our lab by their immunoreaction to synthetic peptides, β-galactosidase fusion proteins and CNBr fragments of apoA-I molecules (15Marcel Y.L. Provost P.R. Koa H. Raffai E. Dac N.V. Fruchart J.-C. Rassart E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3644-3653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody 2H2 against rat synthetic atrial natriuretic factor and Bsol.12 against solubilized apo B (27Milne R. Gutkowska J. Thibault G. Schiller P. Charbonneau C. Genest J. Cantin M. Mol. Immunol. 1987; 24: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) were used as control. All of the mAbs used are murine IgG, which were purified on protein G- or protein A-Sepharose columns (Pharmacia). Fab fragments of these mAbs were prepared by papain digestion and purified by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography.Table I:Effects of antibodies on the transfer of Lp2A-I (9.6 nm) constituents to LDL All components for this assay were dialyzed against 4 liters of TBS at 4°C overnight immediately prior to the experiment. LpA-I particles diluted in 100 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin-TBS were preincubated at 37°C for 30 min with serial dilution of mAbs in 200 μl of TBS, which gave mAb/apoA-I molar ratio between 2 and 0.0625. LDL diluted in 160 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin-TBS was added to initiate the cholesterol transfer process. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The transfer reactions were stopped in an ice bath. Heparin-Mn2+ precipitation procedure was employed to separate LDL and LpA-I as described by others (6McLean L.R. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2893-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 10Lund-Katz S. Hammerschlag B. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2964-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of carrier LDL in 50 μl of Tris buffer, 100 μl of 0.14% heparin, and 25 μl of 1 M MnCl2were added into each tube. The tubes were vortexed, kept on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged in a Microfuge (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The radioactivities of precipitates containing mainly LDL and the supernatants containing LpA-I were subsequently counted in a scintillation counter. A correction factor was included in the calculations to correct for the constant amount of LpA-I, which is co-precipitated and is independent of the presence of antibodies. For cholesterol transfer from LDL to LpA-I, LDL was labeled with [3H]cholesterol, and the assays were done at LpA-I/LDL particle ratio of 40:1. A typical incubation mixture included 2.1 μg of LpA-I protein, 0.5 μg of LDL protein, and mAb starting at 22.5 μg/tube with 1:2 serial dilution. For cholesterol transfer from LpA-I to LDL, LpA-I was labeled with [3H]cholesterol, and the assays were done at LpA-I/LDL particle ratios of 2:1. Particle ratio is calculated using the molar apolipoprotein composition. A typical incubation mixture includes 1.0 μg of LpA-I protein, 4.5 μg of LDL protein, and mAb starting at 12 μg/tube with 1:2 serial dilution. These conditions were determined and chosen within linear range of cholesterol transfer according to the kinetic studies described elsewhere (28Meng Q.-H. Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). No significant difference in the effects of the mAbs tested were observed during incubations varying from 20 to 60 min. Cholesterol transfer rate as a function of incubation time was calculated essentially as described by others (10Lund-Katz S. Hammerschlag B. Phillips M.C. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2964-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The negative and positive values represent inhibitory and enhancement effects of the mAbs on cholesterol transfer, respectively. The transfer reactions were done under the same conditions as above but without isotope labeling and scaled up 10-fold in order to obtain sufficient material for enzymatic assay of cholesterol mass. After incubation for transfer and precipitation of LDL by heparin-Mn2+, the supernatants (LpA-I compartment) were concentrated 5 times by speedvac concentrator (Savant, Farmingdale, NY), and cholesterol mass in these supernatants was determined by enzymatic kits (Boehringer Mannheim). LpA-I labeled with [4-14C]cholesterol ([14C]cholesterol) were incubated with appropriate mAbs in the presence or absence of LDL at the same ratio as for the transfer assay but in smaller volumes. The reaction mixtures were applied onto Paragon Lipo agarose gel electrophoresis system (Beckman, Brea, CA) and run at 100 V for 30 min. The gels were fixed with 10% acetic acid for 5 min and baked to dryness at 80°C. The dry gels were either autoradiographed or sliced into 2-mm fractions for counting of radioactivity. Pure IgG preparation of some mAbs were also iodinated and run in agarose gel electrophoresis to compare their electrophoretic mobility with that of their immunecomplexes. The Lp2A-I, mAbs, and LDL were incubated as described for cholesterol transfer assay. At the end of incubation, the mixtures were immediately applied onto precast native gradient gel (4-20%) (Bio-Rad). The electrophoresis were run at 100 V at room temperature for 6 h, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. In studies to exclude the possibility of fusion between LpA-I and LDL particles during the cholesterol transfer assay, Lp2A-I, −3A-I, and −4A-I were labeled with 125I, incubated with LDL as in the transfer assay, and then separated by native gradient gel electrophoresis. The distribution of radioactivity was then assessed by autoradiography. The effect of anti-apoA-I mAbs on the secondary structures of apoA-I molecules in the LpA-I/anti-apoA-I immunecomplexes were studied by subtractive CD on a Jasco J-40A spectropolarimeter. All samples and mAbs were dialyzed against 0.5 m M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4°C overnight. LpA-I particles were preincubated with different mAbs at mAb/apoA-I molar ratio of 1 in duplicates. Molar ellipticities were read at 222 nm at 24°C in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell. Percent α-helix of the LpA-I or their immunecomplexes were calculated from the molar ellipticities at 222 nm (29Chen G.C. Kane J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) using a mean residue weight for apoA-I of 115.3 and for mouse IgG of 112.5. Discoidal LpA-I prepared in the presence of cholate are well characterized. Variations in the phospholipid, cholesterol, and apoA-I molar ratios generates distinct populations of homogeneous particles with different lipid to apoA-I ratios or with different numbers of apoA-I/particle (18Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4541-4546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Blanche P.J. Forte T.M. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1983; 750: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first studied Lp2A-I (9.6 nm), which represents the major and most stable particle amongst the Lp2A-I species (18Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4541-4546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nichols A.V. Gong E.L. Blanche P.J. Forte T.M. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1983; 750: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Sparks D.L. Phillips M.C. Lund-Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25830-25838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acceptor Lp2A-I (9.6 nm) particles were preincubated with serial dilutions of anti-apoA-I mAbs or control mAbs, and then [3H]cholesterol-labeled LDL were added at Lp2A-I/LDL particle molar ratio of 40:1 to evaluate the effects of anti-apoA-I mAbs in the cholesterol transfer from LDL to Lp2A-I. The apoA-I sequences attributed to each epitope are indicated in Table I. The results are summarized in Fig. 1 and Table I. Antibodies 2H2 and Bsol.12 are nonrelevant mAbs used as negative controls. The following are antibodies that strongly inhibited cholesterol transfer from LDL to Lp2A-I, with the position of their epitopes indicated in the parenthesis: A05 (residues 25-82), 2G11 (residues 25-110), A03 (residues 135-140), r5G9 (residues 149-186), A44 (residues 149-186), and 4A12 (residues 173-205). The inhibitory effects start at mAb/apoA-I molar ratio of 0.25 and reach saturation at mAb/apoA-I molar ratio between 0.5 and 1. However, mAbs 4H1 (residues 2-8) and 3G10 (residues 96-121) do not have any significant effect on cholesterol transfer from LDL to Lp2A-I (9.6 nm) in comparison with the control mAbs. Antibody 5F6 (residues 116-141) marginally increases the cholesterol transfer (20%) compared with the variation in controls (10-15%), but this effect is not mAb dose-dependent. The affinity of these mAbs for Lp2A-I (9.6 nm) particles were previously determined by immunoprecipitation using Pansorbin armed with rabbit anti-mouse IgG and 125I-labeled LpA-I (30Leblond L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6058-6067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Meng Q.-H. Calabresi L. Fruchart J.C. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16966-16973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using these parameters, no correlation is seen between the affinity of these mAbs for LpA-I and their effects on cholesterol transfer. The effects of Fab fragments of 3G10, A03, A44, and 4A12 on cholesterol transfer from LDL to Lp2A-I were also tested. The inhibitory effects of A03, A44, and 4A12 remain but are slightly attenuated (between 60 and 80% at Fab/apoA-I molar ratio of 4) (Fig. 2). Fabs of 4H1 and 5F6 did not affect cholesterol transfer significantly (data not shown). When [3H]cholesterol-labeled Lp2A-I (9.6 nm) was used as cholesterol donor to test the influence of mAbs on cholesterol transfer from Lp2A-I (9.6 nm) to LDL, all of the mAbs that inhibit cholesterol transfer from LDL to LpA-I do enhance cholesterol transfer from this Lp2A-I to LDL (Table I). The only difference is observed with mAb 3G10, which does not significantly affect cholesterol transfer from LDL to Lp2A-I, but increases the cholesterol transfer from Lp2A-I (9.6 nm) to LDL by about 70%. Since specific anti-apoA-I mAbs both stimulate the transfer of cholesterol from Lp2A-I to LDL and inhibit transfer in the opposite direction, net mass transfer of cholesterol from LDL to LpA-I must take place. Indeed cholesterol mass in the supernatant fractions (LpA-I compartment) is significantly reduced after incubation with LDL in the presence of mAbs such as A05, A03, A44, and 4A12, but not with 4H1 or control mAb 2H2 (Fig. 3). To address the possibility of artifacts related to the binding of mAbs to heparin or LDL, we have tested the binding of the anti-apoA-I mAbs to heparin or LDL by radioimmunoassay. The removawells were coated with heparin-Mn2+ reagent or LDL and incubated with these mAbs and then with iodinated anti-mouse IgG. None of these mAbs showed binding affinity for heparin or LDL (data not illustrated). The effects of these anti-apoA-I mAbs on cholesterol transfer to and from LDL were also studied using other Lp2A-I particles of different sizes. Very similar results were observed, and the same mAbs inhibited transfer from LDL to Lp2A-I and enhanced transfer in the opposite direction (Table II). In contrast, these antibodies have no effect on the transfers to and from Lp2A-I (7.8 nm) (not illustrated), the smallest and most cholesterol enriched particle in the Lp2A-I class. This particle also is unstable and tends to release free apoA-I from which it is difficult to separate. We attribute the lack of antibody effect on transfer reactions with this particle to its extreme composition and its unstability.Table II:Effects of anti-apoA-I monoclonal antibodies on cholesterol transfer between LDL and Lp2A-I (8.6 nm and 10.2 nm) We have also observed no effect by anti-apoA-I mAbs on cholesterol transfer between LDL and either Lp3A-I or Lp4A-I (not illustrated). The kinetics of these transfer have been studied in details elsewhere (28Meng Q.-H. Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Lp3A-I or −4A-I of a size and composition identical to these studied here were found to exchange very little cholesterol with LDL (28Meng Q.-H. Sparks D.L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Lp2A-I was the most active donor and acceptor. We attribute the lack of the effect of the mAbs on cholesterol transfer to the large particles to the slow transfer rates. The effect of mAbs on the transfer of lipoprotein components other than cholesterol between Lp2A-I and LDL were also evaluated. Lp2A-I (9.6 nm) particles labeled with either 125I-labeled apoA-I or [14C]POPC were incubated with mAbs and LDL under conditions similar to those used for the study of cholesterol transfer and separated from LDL by heparin-Mn2+. There is no significant correlation between the transfers of either 125I-labeled apoA-I or [14C]POPC of Lp2A-I (9.6 nm) to LDL and cholesterol transfers between the same particles. This demonstrates that LpA-I is not transferred or precipitated as a whole particle, but that different mAbs appear to have specific effects on the transfer of cholesterol and phospholipids (Table I). Only antibody A44 causes a significant increase in the precipitation of 125I-labeled LpA-I (17%) together with the increased transfer of cholesterol (100%) and phospholipids (18%). Most mAbs that enhance transfer of cholesterol from LpA-I to LDL, also significantly enhance phospholipid transfer (2G11, A05, 3G10, A03, A44), whereas those that have minimal or no effect on cholesterol transfer have no effect on phospholipids (4H1, 5F6). The exceptions are 4A12, which elicits a highly significant transfer of cholesterol but not of POPC and apoA-I, and 3G10, which has a weak effect on cholesterol transfer compared with its effect on POPC and apoA-I transfer. To exclude the possibility that in the presence of LDL, the binding of mAbs to LpA-I may induce the destabilization or rearrangement of Lp2A-I and thereby nonspecific incorporation of Lp2A-I constituents into LDL (fusion of lipoprotein particles), 125I-labeled Lp2A-I (9.6 nm) were prepared and incubated with mAbs in the presence and absence of LDL. The migration profiles of Lp2A-I particles on agarose gel electrophoresis are affected differently by the presence of specific mAbs, and these shifts in migration provide evidence for the binding of mAbs to Lp2A-I particles. However, the presence or absence of LDL does not induce any additional change in migration LpA-I or LpA-I˙mAb complexes (Fig. 4, A-C). Therefore, the difference of mobility of the immunecomplexes reflects the difference in surface charge of each mAb (Fig. 4 D). The same incubation mixtures were also applied onto native gradient gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 5, LDL do not enter the separation gel in a 4-20% gradient gel. In the incubation mixture containing phosphate-buffered saline or control mAb 2H2, Lp2A-I (9.6 nm) migrate to their normal position, while in the presence of mAbs 4H1, 2G11, A03, 5F6, 3G10, A44, and 4A12, Lp2A-I formed complexes of different sizes as indicated by the migration bands with much higher molecular weights. Immunoblots using anti-mouse IgG and anti-apoAI showed that these high molecular weight bands are immunecomplexes rather than larger LpA-I particles (data not shown). As mentioned above, when 125I-labeled LpA-I are used in the same experiments, there is no radioactivity incorporated into LDL zone (data not illustrated). This demonstrates that there is no particle fusion of LpA-I with LDL duri"
https://openalex.org/W2068833911,"Single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator or pro-urokinase (pro-UK) has been reported to have a significant intrinsic amidolytic and plasminogen activator activity, estimated to be about 0.2-0.6% that of two-chain urokinase (UK). However, it has also been suggested that this reported activity is related entirely to trace UK contaminants generated during the analytic procedures. In an attempt to resolve this controversy, it was decided to measure the incorporation of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) by pro-UK and UK. Surprisingly, it was found that although >98% of the apparent intrinsic activity of pro-UK was inhibited by 5 m M DFP, >97% of this activity was recoverable after exhaustive dialysis of the preparation. This finding could not be explained by UK generation, which was excluded. Instead, the findings indicated that DFP inhibition of pro-UK, in contrast to UK and other serine proteases, was largely reversible. The reaction rate of the reversible inhibition was significantly slower than that of irreversible inhibition by DFP. When the hydrolysis of DFP (2 m M) during incubation (37°C) with or without pro-UK (20 μM) was compared, a >5-fold acceleration of DFP hydrolysis in the presence of pro-UK was found, whereas little loss of DFP occurred in the presence of UK (20 μM), consistent with 1:1 stoichiometry. This suggested that pro-UK acted as a slow DFPase in the reaction, a finding consistent with a reversible DFP-enzyme reaction. It was concluded that pro-UK has a distinct and measurable intrinsic catalytic activity, which is qualitatively unique and thereby distinguishable from that of UK as well as other serine proteases.

Single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator behaves like a zymogen in plasma, since it is inert at physiological concentrations and does not form SDS stable complexes with plasma inhibitors (1Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1986; 67: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since it is the precursor of two-chain urokinase (UK), 1The abbreviations used are:UKurokinasepro-UKpro-urokinase or single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activatorDFPdiisopropyl fluorophosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresismODmini-absorbance. 1The abbreviations used are:UKurokinasepro-UKpro-urokinase or single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activatorDFPdiisopropyl fluorophosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresismODmini-absorbance. this proenzyme is commonly referred to as pro-urokinase (pro-UK) (2Wun T.-C. Ossowski L. Reich E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7262-7268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).However, relative to other zymogen precursors of serine proteases, pro-UK has been found by several studies to have a much higher intrinsic activity estimated to be 0.4% (3Pannell R.

By contrast, some studies have suggested that pro-UK has no measurable intrinsic activity (7Urano T. de Serrano V.S. Gaffney P.J. Castellino F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Husain S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5797-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and that the reported activity is related to trace UK contaminants.The discrepancies among these studies have not been reconciled but are related to the technical problem involved in effectively preventing UK generation by plasmin, the product of plasminogen activation. In order to help resolve the controversy, it was decided to analyze the incorporation of radiolabeled diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), which has been shown previously to be incorporated by pro-UK (9Husain S.S. Gurewich V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 220: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), since any incorporation by two-chain UK contaminants can be readily identified by electrophoresis under reducing conditions.Surprisingly, it was found that the inactivation of pro-UK by DFP was predominantly (>97%) reversible. To our knowledge, this finding is unique to pro-UK since the interaction between DFP and UK as well as other serine proteases is irreversible. As a result, the findings demonstrate that the intrinsic activity of pro-UK can be qualitatively distinguished from that of UK contaminants.MATERIALS AND METHODS[3H]DFP Incorporation of Pro-UK—Highly purified recombinant pro-UK (10 μM) from Escherichia coli (Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy), which was DFP-pretreated (5 m M) to inactivate trace UK contaminants, or UK (1 μM) was incubated (37°C) with 0.1 m M [3H]DFP (DuPont NEN; maximal concentration obtainable) for 6 h with or without 0.1 m M Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Tween 80. Samples were removed, and either boiled immediately in reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer or boiled after exhaustive dialysis. After 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography, the radioactive bands were cut out for counting. The single-chain pro-UK was seen separately as a ≈50-kDa band, whereas any UK contaminants were seen at ≈30 kDa. Evidence that incorporation of DFP occurred at the active site serine rather than elsewhere was obtained by using denatured (reduced and carboxymethylated) pro-UK as a control.Amidolytic Activity of Pro-UK in the Presence of DFP and after Dialysis—20 μM pro-UK or 40 n M UK was incubated (37°C) with 5 m M DFP for 6 h. A 500-fold excess of pro-UK was used based on the intrinsic activity of pro-UK against S2444 being ≈0.2% the activity of UK (3Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1987; 69: 22-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were then exhaustively dialyzed to remove DFP. Using the synthetic substrate S2444 (final concentration of 0.75 m M), aliquots of incubated samples were taken and diluted by 1:2 for assay of amidolytic activity before and after dialysis. The amidolytic activity was measured by the increase in absorbanceover time at 410 nm against a reference wave length of 490 nm (410/490 nm) on a microtiter plate reader (MR5000; Dynatech Laboratory Inc., Alexandria, VA) as described previously (10Liu J. Gurewich V. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2012-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As a control, pro-UK (20 μM) without DFP was similarly incubated and dialyzed. Protein concentrations of pro-UK before and after dialysis were determined by measuring A280(E280%; = 1.36).DFP Inactivation of Pro-UK and UK—Pro-UK (2.5 μM) or UK (5.0 n M) was incubated with S2444 (0.75 m M) at 37°C in the presence of a range of concentrations (0-10 m M) of DFP. The amount of amidolytic activity generated was measured by the increase in absorbance over 30 min, as described previously (10Liu J. Gurewich V. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2012-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Acceleration of DFP Hydrolysis by Pro-UK—The spontaneous hydrolysis of DFP was determined by measuring the amidolytic activity of plasmin remaining after its addition to DFP samples as follows. DFP (0.2, 2.0, and 5.0 m M) was incubated (37°C); at time points ranging from 0 to 48 h, 100-μl aliquots were removed for incubation (37°C) with 100 μl of plasmin (100 n M) for 30 min. 50 μl of the incubation mixture was then removed and added with 50 μl of S2251 (3.0 m M) to measure residual plasmin activity.Based on the findings from the above experiment, DFP (2.0 m M) was then incubated (37°C) in the presence or absence of 20 μM pro-UK or UK. After a 16-h incubation, 100-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture and incubated (37°C) with 100 μl of plasmin (100 n M) for 30 min. 50 μl of the incubation mixture was then removed and added to 50 μl of S2251 (3.0 m M) to measure residual plasmin activity. S2251 is insensitive to UK or pro-UK.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION[3H]DFP Incorporation of Pro-UK—Relative to the [3H]DFP incorporation by UK (100%), incorporation by pro-UK was only 0.04 ± 0.03%. Autoradiography of reduced SDS-PAGE showed essentially a single band with a Mr≈50,000 in the lane corresponding to pro-UK (10 μM), which was readily distinguishable from a band with a Mr≈33,000 in the lane corresponding to the UK (1 μM) control. There was no measurable incorporation of [3H]DFP by denatured pro-UK, indicating that incorporation of the [3H]DFP by pro-UK was specific for the active site serine. This was further confirmed by the fact that [3H]DFP incorporation was largely diminished in the presence of 0.1 m M Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, a specific inhibitor of the active site of UK. A similar incorporation of [3H]DFP by the active site of a plasmin-resistant mutant pro-UK has been reported previously (11Manchanda N. Schwartz B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the trace amount of [3H]diisopropyl phosphate-pro-UK was not very stable, because it was found that the [3H]DFP-incorporated Mr50,000 band disappeared on the reduced SDS-PAGE after the sample was exhaustively dialyzed. By contrast, the band of [3H]diisopropyl phosphate-UK remained.Amidolytic Activity of Pro-UK Inhibited by DFP Is Mostly Recovered after Dialysis (Fig. 1)—The base-line amidolytic activity of the pro-UK preparation was 0.2% that of UK, consistent with previous reports (1Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1986; 67: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1987; 69: 22-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ellis V. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14998-15003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of DFP (5.0 m M) resulted in a loss of >98.6% of the amidolytic activity of pro-UK and >99.99% of the activity of UK. However, after exhaustive dialysis, ≈97.2% of the amidolytic activity of pro-UK was recovered, whereas no activity was recovered from DFP-treated UK. The possibility that this finding was related to trace UK generation due to autoactivation of pro-UK or due to activation by a non-serine protease contaminant was tested by autoradiography of a 125I-pro-UK probe, which allowed the detection of ≈0.08% UK (≈40 ng) generation from the 50-μg pro-UK sample (20 μM× 50 μl) containing 0.5% of 125I-pro-UK (≈5 μCi/μg or ≈8000 cmp/ng). No evidence of UK generation was found (date not shown). This was further confirmed by a control in which 20 μM pro-UK was incubated in parallel and dialyzed without DFP treatment (Fig. 1). Under these conditions no significant UK was generated, since only 0.8% (20.00 versus 20.16 mOD/min) increase in UK activity occurred, which was insignificant since it was much smaller than the S.D. of the experiment. These data therefore indicate that DFP inactivation of pro-UK, in contrast to other serine proteases, is almost completely reversible. This conclusion is also consistent with a previously published, but unexplained observation, that [3H]DFP incorporation by a plasmin-resistant mutant pro-UK was not prevented by preincubation with excess unlabeled DFP (with subsequent hydrolysis of the unlabeled DFP) (11Manchanda N. Schwartz B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).DFP Inactivation of Pro-UK and UK (Fig. 2)—The amidolytic activity of UK was rapidly inhibited by 1 m M DFP, and this inhibition was irreversible as is characteristic for serine proteases. By contrast, pro-UK was far more resistant to inactivation by DFP as also observed previously (9Husain S.S. Gurewich V. Arch. Biochem.

Only 40% of its activity was inhibited by 1 m M DFP, and 85% was inhibited by 5-10 m M DFP within 30 min of incubation. The remaining pro-UK activity was inhibited by longer (>30 min) incubation with higher (>10 m M) concentrations of DFP. However, as noted above, ≈97% of this activity was recoverable and therefore represented a reversible inhibition by DFP.FIG. 2DFP inactivation of pro-UK (Δ) and UK (●). Pro-UK (2.5 μM) or UK (5.0 n M) was incubated with S2444 (0.75 m M) in the presence of DFP (0-10 m M) and the amidolytic activity measured by absorbance increase over 30 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Acceleration of DFP Hydrolysis by Pro-UK (Fig. 3)—Incubation (37°C) of DFP (0.2, 2.0, and 5.0 m M) for 0-48 h showed that its activity, sufficient to completely inactivate plasmin (50 n M), was dose-dependent but was retained for at least 6 h, followed by a progressive loss of activity.

The DFP remaining was expressed by the residual plasmin S2551 activity measured after 30-min incubation of plasmin and DFP samples. Less residual plasmin activity indicated more DFP remaining. When DFP was incubated without pro-UK, the residual plasmin activity after 16 h was about 1.46 mOD/min, corresponding to 5.8% of the total added plasmin activity (25 mOD/min). However, when pro-UK was included in the reaction mixture, 7.95 mOD/min of plasmin activity remained, which corresponded to 31.8% of the total added plasmin. This reflected a significantly greater loss of DFP activity in the presence of pro-UK. When the same molar concentration of UK was substituted for pro-UK, little effect (1.46 versus 1.47 mOD/min) on DFP inactivation of plasmin was observed, consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometric interaction. The findings indicate that hydrolysis of DFP is accelerated by pro-UK and suggest that pro-UK acts as a slow DFPase, which catalyzed the reaction. Therefore, the interaction of DFP with pro-UK, in contrast to UK, is non-stoichiometric.These findings are consistent with a reversible inhibition of pro-UK by DFP. Although a DFP-enzyme complex was formed in the active site of pro-UK, this complex appears to be unstable. By contrast, this complex has been described as being “indefinitely stable” with other serine proteases (12Stryer L. Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1988: 223Google Scholar). Although this phenomenon remains to be explained, it may be seen as representing yet another of a series of exceptional properties of the catalytic site of pro-UK. These include its relatively high intrinsic activity (1Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1986; 67: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pannell R. Gurewich V.

Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The structural determinants responsible for these properties of the catalytic domain of pro-UK remain to be determined.In conclusion, the present findings confirm that pro-UK has a measurable intrinsic activity, which is qualitatively distinct and readily distinguishable from UK contaminants. To our knowledge, a reversible inactivation by DFP has not been reported previously for any serine protease. Single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator behaves like a zymogen in plasma, since it is inert at physiological concentrations and does not form SDS stable complexes with plasma inhibitors (1Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1986; 67: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since it is the precursor of two-chain urokinase (UK), 1The abbreviations used are:UKurokinasepro-UKpro-urokinase or single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activatorDFPdiisopropyl fluorophosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresismODmini-absorbance. 1The abbreviations used are:UKurokinasepro-UKpro-urokinase or single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activatorDFPdiisopropyl fluorophosphatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresismODmini-absorbance. this proenzyme is commonly referred to as pro-urokinase (pro-UK) (2Wun T.-C.

However, relative to other zymogen precursors of serine proteases, pro-UK has been found by several studies to have a much higher intrinsic activity estimated to be 0.4% (3Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1987; 69: 22-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Petersen L.D. Lund L.R. Dano K. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 14998-15003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the activity of UK. This relative activity is about 5,000-fold higher than that of most protease zymogens. By contrast, some studies have suggested that pro-UK has no measurable intrinsic activity (7Urano T. de Serrano V.S. Gaffney P.J. Castellino F.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Husain S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5797-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and that the reported activity is related to trace UK contaminants. The discrepancies among these studies have not been reconciled but are related to the technical problem involved in effectively preventing UK generation by plasmin, the product of plasminogen activation. In order to help resolve the controversy, it was decided to analyze the incorporation of radiolabeled diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), which has been shown previously to be incorporated by pro-UK (9Husain S.S. Gurewich V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 220: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), since any incorporation by two-chain UK contaminants can be readily identified by electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Surprisingly, it was found that the inactivation of pro-UK by DFP was predominantly (>97%) reversible. To our knowledge, this finding is unique to pro-UK since the interaction between DFP and UK as well as other serine proteases is irreversible. As a result, the findings demonstrate that the intrinsic activity of pro-UK can be qualitatively distinguished from that of UK contaminants. MATERIALS AND METHODS[3H]DFP Incorporation of Pro-UK—Highly purified recombinant pro-UK (10 μM) from Escherichia coli (Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy), which was DFP-pretreated (5 m M) to inactivate trace UK contaminants, or UK (1 μM) was incubated (37°C) with 0.1 m M [3H]DFP (DuPont NEN; maximal concentration obtainable) for 6 h with or without 0.1 m M Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Tween 80. Samples were removed, and either boiled immediately in reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer or boiled after exhaustive dialysis. After 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and autoradiography, the radioactive bands were cut out for counting. The single-chain pro-UK was seen separately as a ≈50-kDa band, whereas any UK contaminants were seen at ≈30 kDa. Evidence that incorporation of DFP occurred at the active site serine rather than elsewhere was obtained by using denatured (reduced and carboxymethylated) pro-UK as a control.Amidolytic Activity of Pro-UK in the Presence of DFP and after Dialysis—20 μM pro-UK or 40 n M UK was incubated (37°C) with 5 m M DFP for 6 h. A 500-fold excess of pro-UK was used based on the intrinsic activity of pro-UK against S2444 being ≈0.2% the activity of UK (3Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1987; 69: 22-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were then exhaustively dialyzed to remove DFP. Using the synthetic substrate S2444 (final concentration of 0.75 m M), aliquots of incubated samples were taken and diluted by 1:2 for assay of amidolytic activity before and after dialysis. The amidolytic activity was measured by the increase in absorbanceover time at 410 nm against a reference wave length of 490 nm (410/490 nm) on a microtiter plate reader (MR5000; Dynatech Laboratory Inc., Alexandria, VA) as described previously (10Liu J. Gurewich V. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2012-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As a control, pro-UK (20 μM) without DFP was similarly incubated and dialyzed. Protein concentrations of pro-UK before and after dialysis were determined by measuring A280(E280%; = 1.36).DFP Inactivation of Pro-UK and UK—Pro-UK (2.5 μM) or UK (5.0 n M) was incubated with S2444 (0.75 m M) at 37°C in the presence of a range of concentrations (0-10 m M) of DFP. The amount of amidolytic activity generated was measured by the increase in absorbance over 30 min, as described previously (10Liu J. Gurewich V. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2012-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Acceleration of DFP Hydrolysis by Pro-UK—The spontaneous hydrolysis of DFP was determined by measuring the amidolytic activity of plasmin remaining after its addition to DFP samples as follows. DFP (0.2, 2.0, and 5.0 m M) was incubated (37°C); at time points ranging from 0 to 48 h, 100-μl aliquots were removed for incubation (37°C) with 100 μl of plasmin (100 n M) for 30 min. 50 μl of the incubation mixture was then removed and added with 50 μl of S2251 (3.0 m M) to measure residual plasmin activity.Based on the findings from the above experiment, DFP (2.0 m M) was then incubated (37°C) in the presence or absence of 20 μM pro-UK or UK. After a 16-h incubation, 100-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture and incubated (37°C) with 100 μl of plasmin (100 n M) for 30 min. 50 μl of the incubation mixture was then removed and added to 50 μl of S2251 (3.0 m M) to measure residual plasmin activity. S2251 is insensitive to UK or pro-UK.

Gurewich V. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6311-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The structural determinants responsible for these properties of the catalytic domain of pro-UK remain to be determined.In conclusion, the present findings confirm that pro-UK has a measurable intrinsic activity, which is qualitatively distinct and readily distinguishable from UK contaminants. To our knowledge, a reversible inactivation by DFP has not been reported previously for any serine protease. [3H]DFP Incorporation of Pro-UK—Relative to the [3H]DFP incorporation by UK (100%), incorporation by pro-UK was only 0.04 ± 0.03%. Autoradiography of reduced SDS-PAGE showed essentially a single band with a Mr≈50,000 in the lane corresponding to pro-UK (10 μM), which was readily distinguishable from a band with a Mr≈33,000 in the lane corresponding to the UK (1 μM) control. There was no measurable incorporation of [3H]DFP by denatured pro-UK, indicating that incorporation of the [3H]DFP by pro-UK was specific for the active site serine. This was further confirmed by the fact that [3H]DFP incorporation was largely diminished in the presence of 0.1 m M Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, a specific inhibitor of the active site of UK. A similar incorporation of [3H]DFP by the active site of a plasmin-resistant mutant pro-UK has been reported previously (11Manchanda N. Schwartz B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the trace amount of [3H]diisopropyl phosphate-pro-UK was not very stable, because it was found that the [3H]DFP-incorporated Mr50,000 band disappeared on the reduced SDS-PAGE after the sample was exhaustively dialyzed. By contrast, the band of [3H]diisopropyl phosphate-UK remained. Amidolytic Activity of Pro-UK Inhibited by DFP Is Mostly Recovered after Dialysis (Fig. 1)—The base-line amidolytic activity of the pro-UK preparation was 0.2% that of UK, consistent with previous reports (1Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1986; 67: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Pannell R. Gurewich V. Blood. 1987; 69: 22-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ellis V. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14998-15003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of DFP (5.0 m M) resulted in a loss of >98.6% of the amidolytic activity of pro-UK and >99.99% of the activity of UK. However, after exhaustive dialysis, ≈97.2% of the amidolytic activity of pro-UK was recovered, whereas no activity was recovered from DFP-treated UK. The possibility that this finding was related to trace UK generation due to autoactivation of pro-UK or due to activation by a non-serine protease contaminant was tested by autoradiography of a 125I-pro-UK probe, which allowed the detection of ≈0.08% UK (≈40 ng) generation from the 50-μg pro-UK sample (20 μM× 50 μl) containing 0.5% of 125I-pro-UK (≈5 μCi/μg or ≈8000 cmp/ng). No evidence of UK generation was found (date not shown). This was further confirmed by a control in which 20 μM pro-UK was incubated in parallel and dialyzed without DFP treatment (Fig. 1). Under these conditions no significant UK was generated, since only 0.8% (20.00 versus 20.16 mOD/min) increase in UK activity occurred, which was insignificant since it was much smaller than the S.D. of the experiment. These data therefore indicate that DFP inactivation of pro-UK, in contrast to other serine proteases, is almost completely reversible. This conclusion is also consistent with a previously published, but unexplained observation, that [3H]DFP incorporation by a plasmin-resistant mutant pro-UK was not prevented by preincubation with excess unlabeled DFP (with subsequent hydrolysis of the unlabeled DFP) (11Manchanda N. Schwartz B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DFP Inactivation of Pro-UK and UK (Fig. 2)—The amidolytic activity of UK was rapidly inhibited by 1 m M DFP, and this inhibition was irreversible as is characteristic for serine proteases. By contrast, pro-UK was far more resistant to inactivation by DFP as also observed previously (9Husain S.S. Gurewich V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 220: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 11Manchanda N. Schwartz B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14580-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only 40% of its activity was inhibited by 1 m M DFP, and 85% was inhibited by 5-10 m M DFP within 30 min of incubation. The remaining pro-UK activity was inhibited by longer (>30 min) incubation with higher (>10 m M) concentrations of DFP. However, as noted above, ≈97% of this activity was recoverable and therefore represented a reversible inhibition by DFP. Acceleration of DFP Hydrolysis by Pro-UK (Fig. 3)—Incubation (37°C) of DFP (0.2, 2.0, and 5.0 m M) for 0-48 h showed that its activity, sufficient to completely inactivate plasmin (50 n M), was dose-dependent but was retained for at least 6 h, followed by a progressive loss of activity. At the highest concentration of DFP (5 m M), activity was preserved for 24 h, as indicated by essentially complete plasmin inactivation (Fig. 3). A 16-h period of incubation was therefore selected for the experiment with 20 μM pro-UK or UK incubated with 2.0 m M DFP. The DFP remaining was expressed by the residual plasmin S2551 activity measured after 30-min incubation of plasmin and DFP samples. Less residual plasmin activity indicated more DFP remaining. When DFP was incubated without pro-UK, the residual plasmin activity after 16 h was about 1.46 mOD/min, corresponding to 5.8% of the total added plasmin activity (25 mOD/min). However, when pro-UK was included in the reaction mixture, 7.95 mOD/min of plasmin activity remained, which corresponded to 31.8% of the total added plasmin. This reflected a significantly greater loss of DFP activity in the presence of pro-UK. When the same molar concentration of UK was substituted for pro-UK, little effect (1.46 versus 1.47 mOD/min) on DFP inactivation of plasmin was observed, consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometric interaction. The findings indicate that hydrolysis of DFP is accelerated by pro-UK and suggest that pro-UK acts as a slow DFPase, which catalyzed the reaction. Therefore, the interaction of DFP with pro-UK, in contrast to UK, is non-stoichiometric. These findings are consistent with a reversible inhibition of pro-UK by DFP. Although a DFP-enzyme complex was formed in the active site of pro-UK, this complex appears to be unstable. By contrast, this complex has been described as being “indefinitely stable” with other serine proteases (12Stryer L. Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1988: 223Google Scholar). Although this phenomenon remains to be explained, it may be seen as representing yet another of a series of exceptional properties of the catalytic site of pro-UK.
