https://openalex.org/W1964129602,"The seven-transmembrane-spanning receptors of the FZD1–10 class are bound and activated by the WNT family of lipoglycoproteins, thereby inducing a complex network of signaling pathways. However, the specificity of the interaction between mammalian WNT and FZD proteins and the subsequent signaling cascade downstream of the different WNT-FZD pairs have not been systematically addressed to date. In this study, we determined the binding affinities of various WNTs for different members of the FZD family by using bio-layer interferometry and characterized their functional selectivity in a cell system. Using purified WNTs, we show that different FZD cysteine-rich domains prefer to bind to distinct WNTs with fast on-rates and slow off-rates. In a 32D cell-based system engineered to overexpress FZD2, FZD4, or FZD5, we found that WNT-3A (but not WNT-4, -5A, or -9B) activated the WNT-β-catenin pathway through FZD2/4/5 as measured by phosphorylation of LRP6 and β-catenin stabilization. Surprisingly, different WNT-FZD pairs showed differential effects on phosphorylation of DVL2 and DVL3, revealing a previously unappreciated DVL isoform selectivity by different WNT-FZD pairs in 32D cells. In summary, we present extensive mapping of WNT-FZD cysteine-rich domain interactions complemented by analysis of WNT-FZD pair functionality in a unique cell system expressing individual FZD isoforms. Differential WNT-FZD binding and selective functional readouts suggest that endogenous WNT ligands evolved with an intrinsic natural bias toward different downstream signaling pathways, a phenomenon that could be of great importance in the design of FZD-targeting drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2019502776,"Enzymes in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway are recruited to form a dynamic metabolic complex referred to as the purinosome. Previous studies have demonstrated that purinosome assembly responds to purine levels in culture medium. Purine-depleted medium or 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT) treatment stimulates the purinosome assembly in HeLa cells. Here, several metabolomic technologies were applied to quantify the static cellular levels of purine nucleotides and measure the de novo biosynthesis rate of IMP, AMP, and GMP. Direct comparison of purinosome-rich cells (cultured in purine-depleted medium) and normal cells showed a 3-fold increase in IMP concentration in purinosome-rich cells and similar levels of AMP, GMP, and ratios of AMP/GMP and ATP/ADP for both. In addition, a higher level of IMP was also observed in HeLa cells treated with DMAT. Furthermore, increases in the de novo IMP/AMP/GMP biosynthetic flux rate under purine-depleted condition were observed. The synthetic enzymes, adenylosuccinate synthase (ADSS) and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), downstream of IMP were also shown to be part of the purinosome. Collectively, these results provide further evidence that purinosome assembly is directly related to activated de novo purine biosynthesis, consistent with the functionality of the purinosome.

Purine nucleotides have very important and diverse functions inside the cell. They are building blocks of DNA and RNA, energy carriers, and cell signaling molecules, and the play central roles in metabolism. Purine nucleotides are biosynthesized by the de novo pathway and recycled from their free bases by the salvage pathway. IMP serves as a purine nucleotide precursor, which can be synthesized from 5-phospho-α-d-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) 3The abbreviations used are: PRPP5-phospho-α-d-ribose 1-diphosphateP−purine-depletedP+purine-richUPLC-ESI-MS/MSultra high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometryPPATphosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferaseFGAMSformylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthaseDMAT2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazoleOPLS-DAthe orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysisIMPDHinosine monophosphate dehydrogenaseADSSadenylosuccinate synthaseOFPorange fluorescence proteinATICaminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase-IMP cyclohydrolase. by the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway or made from hypoxanthine by the salvage pathway. The de novo pathway contains 10 highly conserved chemical steps that require the coordination of six enzymes in humans. It has long been hypothesized that these six enzymes form a functional multienzyme complex in the cell similar to what has been observed previously with other sequential metabolic enzymes (1Rowe P.B.

Many advantages for metabolic multienzyme complexes have been proposed in the literature. The first is kinetic in that these complexes increase metabolic flux by increasing the local concentration of a substrate/intermediate or reducing the diffusion process of intermediate substrates. In addition to the kinetic advantage, colocalization of metabolic proteins may protect or stabilize chemically unstable intermediates and separate the intermediates from competing chemical and enzymatic reactions (4Wombacher H.

Our studies based on live-cell fluorescence microscopy have shown the colocalization of these six enzymes into clusters, referred to as purinosomes, under purine-depleted (P−) conditions. A hypothesis was proposed that purinosomes form to satisfy the cellular demand for purines through increasing de novo purine biosynthesis (11An S. Kumar R. Sheets E.D. Benkovic S.J.

U.S.A. 2013; 110: 2528-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, alteration of intracellular purine nucleotide pools in purinosome-containing cells, specifically whether de novo synthesis flux of the individual purines, such as IMP, AMP, and GMP, is increased, has never been reported. Purine nucleotide profiling is an analytical challenge because of their high polarity, instability, and chemical similarities under traditional reverse phase methodologies (17Cordell R.L. Hill S.J. Ortori C.A. Barrett D.A. Quantitative profiling of nucleotides and related phosphate-containing metabolites in cultured mammalian cells by liquid chromatography tandem electrospray mass spectrometry.J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2008; 871: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we applied hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-based ultra high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) to specifically quantify each individual cellular purine nucleotide in purinosome-rich HeLa cells (cultured in P− medium) and in normal HeLa cells (cultured in non-dialyzed FBS-based purine-rich (P+) medium), including IMP, the product of the de novo pathway, and two direct products of subsequent branch pathways, AMP and GMP, as well as their corresponding phosphorylated species: ADP, ATP, GDP, and GTP. The observed differences in nucleotide cellular concentrations between purinosome-rich cells and normal cells were further confirmed by 1H NMR global metabolite scanning. Previous studies have measured the metabolic rate of the de novo pathway in CHO fibroblast cell lines in purine-free medium by the incorporation of [14C]glycine in all cellular purines (18Yamaoka T.

Using the same method, our laboratory reported that the de novo biosynthesis rate of total purines is about 42% greater in purine-depleted medium when compared with purine-rich medium (13An S. Deng Y. Tomsho J.W. Kyoung M. Benkovic S.J. Microtubule-assisted mechanism for functional metabolic macromolecular complex formation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 12872-12876Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the pool of purines inside a cell contains many different species, such as nucleotides, nucleosides, and free bases. Purine nucleotides are products of multiple biological processes: de novo biosynthesis, purine nucleotide cycle and salvage pathway recycling, degradation, and urinary excretion. To determine the metabolic rate of the de novo pathway more accurately, the incorporation of [15N]glycine into IMP, AMP, and GMP, respectively, through the de novo pathway was measured by super resolution mass spectrometry with an LC-Orbitrap in this study. Cell culture followed the same protocol published before (11An S. Kumar R. Sheets E.D. Benkovic S.J. Reversible compartmentalization of de novo purine biosynthetic complexes in living cells.Science. 2008; 320: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For cells cultured in purine-depleted medium, all cells were regularly maintained in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) for three passages (about 1 week) before harvesting. FBS was dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl at 4 °C for 2 days using a 25,000 molecular weight cut off dialysis membrane to remove purines. Cells in the [15N]glycine incorporation experiment were maintained in minimum essential medium Eagle (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS or 10% dialyzed FBS, respectively. Minimum essential medium Eagle does not contain glycine. Cells were grown in 100 × 20-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon). The cell number per culture for both P+ and P− media is ∼2 × 106. Cells were harvested by 0.25% trypsin/2.21 mm EDTA solution (Mediatech, Inc.) and washed by PBS three times. Any metabolic activity of HeLa cells was quenched by adding 300 μl of cold methanol (preincubated at −80 °C) into the cell pellet. Cells could be kept in the −80 °C freezer before the next step. A total of 2 × 105 HeLa cells grown in purine-rich and purine-depleted media were plated on a 35-mm2 glass bottom plate (MatTek) and incubated at 37 °C (5% CO2) for 16 h. Adherent cells were fixed with freshly prepared 4% (v/v) formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) prepared in 1× Dulbecco's PBS (Corning) for 10 min in the dark at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 prepared in 1× Dulbecco's PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (PPAT) (LifeSpan BioSciences, catalogue number LS-C173822) and formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide synthase (FGAMS) (Bethyl Laboratories; catalogue number A304-218A) were directly labeled using Lightning-Link antibody conjugation kits (Novus Biologics) with Atto488 and Cy3, respectively. Cells were stained with a 1:100 dilution of Atto488-labeled PPAT antibody and a 1:250 dilution of Cy3-labeled FGAMS antibody for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. All antibody dilutions were performed in 1× Dulbecco's PBS. Cells were washed six times with 1 ml of 1× Dulbecco's PBS and placed into Hanks' balanced salt solution prior to imaging. Imaging was performed with a 60× Nikon Apo TIRF oil immersion objective (Nikon) using a S484/15x excitation filter and a S517/30m emission filter for Atto488 detection and a S555/25x excitation filter and a S605/40m emission filter for Cy3 detection (Chroma Technology). The metabolites were extracted according to a procedure slightly modified from previous references (20Danielsson A.P. Moritz T. Mulder H. Spégel P. Development and optimization of a metabolomic method for analysis of adherent cell cultures.Anal. Biochem. 2010; 404: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 21Dettmer K. Nürnberger N.

Bioanal. Chem. 2011; 399: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Basically, collected HeLa cells were added with 500 μl of 80% methanol (20% water) solvent and lysed by a freeze-thaw cycle repeated three times. Then the mixture was centrifuged at 5700 × g, 4 °C for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected. For an additional extraction, 400 μl of 80% methanol (20% water) solvent were added to the cell pellet followed by centrifugation at 5700 × g, 4 °C for 5 min. This extraction was repeated twice. All the supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 7000 × g for at least 20 min to remove the insoluble material. Chromatographic separation of nucleotides from HeLa cell lysates was achieved with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography using an ACQUITY BEH amide (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7-μm particle size) column (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) thermostated at 40 °C. A mobile phase gradient composed of 10 (component A) and 90% (component B) aqueous acetonitrile containing 10 mm ammonium acetate (pH = 9.0) was delivered at a flow rate of 200 μl/min using an ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters Corp). Metabolites were eluted by increasing the percentage of component B in the solvent system from 1 to 40% (v/v) over 12 min. Mass spectrometry-based targeted profiling of nucleotides was performed on a Waters TQ-S triple quadrupole system operating in positive ionization mode with capillary and cone voltages set at 3200 and 30 V, respectively. Source and desolvation temperatures were maintained at 150 and 250 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as both cone gas (150 liters/h) and desolvation gas (800 liters/h), while argon (0.15 ml/min) was used as the collision gas. All of the frozen cell samples (with wet weight of 80 mg) were homogenized in 600 μl of ice-cold methanol/H2O (2:1 v/v) extraction buffer followed by three freeze-thaw cycles with rapid and vigorous manual mixing after each cycle. The samples were extracted using the Precellys tissue homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, Rockville, MD) followed by sonification on wet ice for 10 min. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 18,100 × g and 4 °C. The remaining solid residues were further extracted twice using the same procedure. The combined supernatants from the three extractions were dried after removing methanol in vacuo. Each of the aqueous cell extracts was respectively reconstituted in 600 μl of phosphate buffer (0.1 m K2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 50% D2O and 0.005% 3-(trimethylsilyl)-2,2′,3,3′-tetradeuteropropionic acid as chemical shift reference (δ 0.00 ppm). After vortexing and centrifugation (18,100 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), a total of 550 μl of the supernatants was pipetted into 5-mm NMR tubes for NMR analysis. 1H NMR spectra of cell extracts were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III 600-MHz spectrometer, operating at 600.13 MHz for 1H, equipped with a Bruker inverse detection cryogenic probe (Bruker, Biospin, Germany). For all the samples, a standard water-suppressed one-dimensional NMR spectrum was recorded using the first increment of the NOESY pulse sequence (recycle delay-90°-t1-90°-tm-90°-acquisition) with a recycle delay of 2 s, t1 of 3 μs, and a mixing time, tm, of 100 ms. Typically, the 90° pulse length was adjusted to ∼10 μs and 64 transients were collected into 32,000 data points for each spectrum with a spectral width of 20 ppm. For the purpose of NMR signal assignments, a range of two-dimensional NMR spectra including 1H-1H COSY and total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC), and HMBC were acquired and processed for selective samples. All the 1H NMR spectra were manually corrected for phase and baseline distortions using TOPSPIN (version 3.0, Bruker Biospin) and referenced to the 3-(trimethylsilyl)-2,2′,3,3′-tetradeuteropropionic acid signal (δ 0.0). The spectral region δ 0.5–9.5 was automatically integrated into regions with equal widths of 0.004 ppm (2.4 Hz) using the AMIX software package (V3.8, Bruker Biospin). The region δ 4.7–5.2 was removed to avoid the effects of imperfect water suppression. Each integral region was normalized to the total sum of all integrals for each spectrum to compensate for the overall concentration differences prior to statistical data analysis. The multivariate data analyses were carried out using the SIMCAP+ software package (version 11.0, Umetrics). Principal component analysis was performed for each treatment to generate an overview of the data distribution (e.g. clustering and outliers). A supervised multivariate data analytical tool, the orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), was subsequently applied to the analysis of 1H NMR spectral data scaled to unit variance. The OPLS-DA models were validated using a 7-fold cross validation method, and the quality of the model was described by the parameters R2X, representing the total explained variations, and Q2, indicating the model predictability related to its statistical validity. The validity of all models was additionally ensured with coefficient of variation analysis of variance approach (p < 0.05) and permutation tests (200 permutations). The model was interpreted by back-scale transformed loadings with incorporated color-coded correlation coefficients of the metabolites responsible for the differentiation. The color plot was obtained with version 7.1 of the MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) environment using an in-house developed script. The color of correlation coefficient indicates the importance of the metabolite contributing to the differentiation between classes, with a “hot” color (e.g. red) indicating a higher importance than a “cold” color (e.g. blue). In this study, a correlation coefficient of |r| > 0.602 (i.e. r > 0.602 or r <−0.602) was used as the threshold value for the statistical significance based on the discrimination significance at the level of p < 0.05. Samples were analyzed by HPLC-MS using a modified version of an ion pairing reversed phase negative ion electrospray ionization method (22Lu W. Clasquin M.F. Melamud E. Amador-Noguez D. Caudy A.A. Rabinowitz J.D. Metabolomic analysis via reversed-phase ion-pairing liquid chromatography coupled to a stand alone orbitrap mass spectrometer.Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 3212-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Samples were separated on a Supelco Titan C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.9-μm particle size) (Bellefonte, PA) using a water-methanol gradient with tributylamine added to the aqueous mobile phase. The LC-MS platform consisted of a Dionex Ultimate 3000 quaternary HPLC pump, a Dionex 3000 column compartment, a Dionex 3000 autosampler, and an Exactive plus orbitrap mass spectrometer controlled by Xcalibur 2.2 software (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific). The HPLC column was maintained at 30 °C and a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Solvent A was 3% aqueous methanol with 10 mm tributylamine and 15 mm acetic acid; solvent B was methanol. The gradient was 0 min, 0% B; 5 min, 20% B; 7.5 min, 20% B; 13 min, 55% B; 15.5 min, 95% B, 18.5 min, 95% B; 19 min, 0% B; 25 min 0% B. The orbitrap was operated in negative ion mode at maximum resolution (140,000) and scanned from m/z 85 to m/z 1000. The integrated areas of the reconstructed ion chromatograms for the monoisotopic and 15N isotopologues for the [M-H]− molecular ion were measured to calculate the 15N incorporation. Adenylosuccinate synthase (ADSS) (Clone ID HsCD00295729) and inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2/IMPDH2 (Clone ID Hscd00042407) template cDNA were obtained from the Arizona State University Biodesign Institute plasmid repository (DNASU). Plasmids containing target gene were amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Restriction sites were used in primers: NheI and EcoRI for ADSS and NheI and SacI for IMPDH2. The PCR products were ligated into the modified pmEGFP-N1 vector as described before (11An S. Kumar R. Sheets E.D. Benkovic S.J. Reversible compartmentalization of de novo purine biosynthetic complexes in living cells.Science. 2008; 320: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transformed into XL1-Blue competent cells for propagation and isolated by the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). HeLa cells were maintained in purine-rich or purine-depleted media as described previously (11An S. Kumar R. Sheets E.D. Benkovic S.J. Reversible compartmentalization of de novo purine biosynthetic complexes in living cells.Science. 2008; 320: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Prior to imaging, all samples were washed three times for 5 min with balanced salt solution (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5.6 mm glucose). Cells were imaged at ambient temperature (∼25 °C) on a Nikon TE-2000E inverted fluorescence microscope with a 60× Nikon Apo TIRF oil immersion objective using an S484/15x excitation filter and S517/30m emission filter for GFP and an S555/25x excitation filter and an S605/40m emission filter for OFP. The degree of colocalization of two enzymes in each merge image was determined by Pearson's linear correlation coefficient by ImageJ Colocalization Indices plugins. All images were created using the ImageJ program and were in some cases cropped, inverted, or shown in color for clarity, but were otherwise unmodified. Cells cultured under purine-rich and purine-depleted media were lysed by M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific). Primary antibodies for six pathway enzymes were purchased from either Abcam (Cambridge, MA) or LifeSpan Bioscience (Seattle, WA). Quantification of protein expression levels from Western blots was carried out using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+system (Bio-Rad). For each enzyme, three independent blots containing samples from P+ medium and P− medium were repeated. Student's t test (n = 3) was done to determine the statistical significance between two culture conditions. To elucidate the effect of purinosome formation on the cellular purine nucleotide levels, a multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry-based method capable of measuring 10 well known cellular purine nucleotides simultaneously was developed. Changes in the purine nucleotide pools between cells cultured under the purine-depleted condition and normal cells were quantified (Table 1). Purine depletion was achieved through extensive dialysis of FBS and culturing cells in the growth medium with dialyzed FBS for 168 h (1 week). Purinosome formation by the endogenous enzymes under a purine-depleted condition was further established by the colocalization of two pathway enzymes, PPAT and FGAMS, in the immunostaining image (Fig. 1a). As shown in Table 1, ATP is the most abundant compound in both growth conditions (2.33 nmol/million cells in the purine-rich condition and 2.74 nmol/million cells in the purine-depleted condition) followed by ADP, AMP, GTP, GDP, and GMP. These results are consistent with published normal cellular purine nucleotide levels (23Traut T.W. Physiological concentrations of purines and pyrimidines.Mol. Cell.

The precursors to ATP and GTP, IMP, XMP, and AMPS are in lower abundance relative to ATP and GTP. By comparison, the levels of all metabolites analyzed in purinosome-rich cells were relatively higher than the normally cultured cells. To validate the purine concentration changes between the two conditions, statistical analysis of the 12 cell samples tested was performed. The data showed the IMP concentration to be 2.8-fold higher under purine-depleted conditions than that of purine-rich conditions (p < 0.001). AMP and GMP are slightly higher (p > 0.05), as are ADP and GDP levels. In addition, the average ratio of ATP to ADP remains constant for the two groups (1.96 in purine-rich condition, 1.98 in purine-depleted condition), and the average ratio of AMP to GMP has only an 8% difference (8.50 in purine-rich condition, 7.82 in purine-depleted condition) (Fig. 1b), suggesting that the cellular energy status as determined by the ATP/ADP ratio and the intracellular balance of adenine and guanine nucleotides does not change for cells under the purine-depleted conditions.TABLE 1Concentration of purine nucleotides in HeLa cells under purine-rich (P+) and purine-depleted (P−) conditions, determined by UPLC-ESI-MS/MSP+P−Ratio of P−/P+nmol/million cellsnmol/million cellsAMP0.17 ± 0.030.23 ± 0.071.4ADP1.19 ± 0.191.40 ± 0.431.2ATP2.33 ± 0.442.74 ± 0.871.2GMP0.02 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.011.5GDP0.28 ± 0.030.35 ± 0.051.3GTP0.72 ± 0.110.88 ± 0.161.2IMP0.02 ± 0.010.06 ± 0.033.0***ITP1.05 ± 0.111.25 ± 0.221.2XMP0.05 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.011.6AMPS0.11 ± 0.01"
https://openalex.org/W1996562688,"Formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) are G-protein-coupled receptors that function as chemoattractant receptors in innate immune responses. Here we perform systematic structure-function analyses of FPRs from six mammalian species using structurally diverse FPR peptide agonists and identify a common set of conserved agonist properties with typical features of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Guided by these results, we discover that bacterial signal peptides, normally used to translocate proteins across cytoplasmic membranes, are a vast family of natural FPR agonists. N-terminally formylated signal peptide fragments with variable sequence and length activate human and mouse FPR1 and FPR2 at low nanomolar concentrations, thus establishing FPR1 and FPR2 as sensitive and broad signal peptide receptors. The vomeronasal receptor mFpr-rs1 and its sequence orthologue hFPR3 also react to signal peptides but are much more narrowly tuned in signal peptide recognition. Furthermore, all signal peptides examined here function as potent activators of the innate immune system. They elicit robust, FPR-dependent calcium mobilization in human and mouse leukocytes and trigger a range of classical innate defense mechanisms, such as the production of reactive oxygen species, metalloprotease release, and chemotaxis. Thus, bacterial signal peptides constitute a novel class of immune activators that are likely to contribute to mammalian immune defense against bacteria. This evolutionarily conserved detection mechanism combines structural promiscuity with high specificity and enables discrimination between bacterial and eukaryotic signal sequences. With at least 175,542 predicted sequences, bacterial signal peptides represent the largest and structurally most heterogeneous class of G-protein-coupled receptor agonists currently known for the innate immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2151544209,"Parents influence the development of their offspring in many ways beyond the transmission of DNA. This includes transfer of epigenetic states, nutrients, antibodies and hormones, and behavioural interactions after birth. While the evolutionary consequences of such non-genetic inheritance are increasingly well understood, less is known about how inheritance mechanisms evolve. Here, we present a simple but versatile model to explore the adaptive evolution of non-genetic inheritance. Our model is based on a switch mechanism that produces alternative phenotypes in response to different inputs, including genes and non-genetic factors transmitted from parents and the environment experienced during development. This framework shows how genetic and non-genetic inheritance mechanisms and environmental conditions can act as cues by carrying correlational information about future selective conditions. Differential use of these cues is manifested as different degrees of genetic, parental or environmental morph determination. We use this framework to evaluate the conditions favouring non-genetic inheritance, as opposed to genetic determination of phenotype or within-generation plasticity, by applying it to two putative examples of adaptive non-genetic inheritance: maternal effects on seed germination in plants and transgenerational phase shift in desert locusts. Our simulation models show how the adaptive value of non-genetic inheritance depends on its mechanism, the pace of environmental change, and life history characteristics."

Therefore, a single viral protein can mediate all events necessary for membrane budding and abscission. Viruses exploit amazing strategies, overcoming various cellular membranes to realize their complex life cycle, including cell entry, genome replication, and assembly of virus particles as well as their egress. For many viruses that replicate in the cell nucleus, a major barrier is the nuclear envelope, a double membrane structure enclosing the chromatin. It consists of the inner nuclear membrane, which, in animal cells, is underlaid by a tight lamina meshwork that connects and stabilizes the nuclear envelope, and the outer nuclear membrane, which is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (for a review, see Refs. 1Hetzer M.W.

Building a nuclear envelope at the end of mitosis: coordinating membrane reorganization, nuclear pore complex assembly, and chromatin de-condensation.Chromosoma. 2012; 121: 539-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The nuclear envelope is perforated by nuclear pore complexes, huge macromolecular assemblies of up to 125 MDa in vertebrates that act as selective gateways between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (3Adams R.L. Wente S.R. Uncovering nuclear pore complexity with innovation.Cell. 2013; 152: 1218-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Nuclear pores are used as entry paths for most viruses that replicate in the nucleus (for a review, see Refs. 4Kobiler O. Drayman N. Butin-Israeli V. Oppenheim A. Virus strategies for passing the nuclear envelope barrier.Nucleus. 2012; 3: 526-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5Cohen S. Au S. Panté N. How viruses access the nucleus.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1813: 1634-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In many cases, this involves an at least partial disassembly of the viral capsid at the cytoplasmic side or core of the nuclear pore complex because these particles are too large to pass the pore intact. Although many viruses assemble in the cytoplasm, herpesviruses package their newly replicated genomic DNA into capsids of up to 125 nm within the nucleus. Unlike many other DNA viruses, herpesviruses do not depend on the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis for their release and can also replicate in non-dividing cells. Therefore, they face the challenge of passing the nuclear envelope a second time, now in the opposite direction. Because herpesvirus capsids are too large for passage through the nuclear pore, they are transported through the nuclear envelope by vesicle-mediated transport, also described as an “envelopment-de-envelopment” pathway (6Skepper J.N. Whiteley A. Browne H. Minson A. Herpes simplex virus nucleocapsids mature to progeny virions by an envelopment → deenvelopment → reenvelopment pathway.J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5697-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Capsids bud at the inner nuclear membrane and, therefore, acquire a (primary) envelope, resulting in a nascent virus located in the lumen between the inner and outer nuclear membranes (for a review, see Refs. 7Johnson D.C. Baines J.D. Herpesviruses remodel host membranes for virus egress.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 9: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 8Mettenleiter T.C. Müller F. Granzow H. Klupp B.G. The way out: what we know and do not know about herpesvirus nuclear egress.Cell. Microbiol. 2013; 15: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the primary envelope fuses with the outer nuclear membrane, resulting in translocation of the capsid to the cytoplasm. Final maturation, including assembly of the tegument and secondary envelopment, follows in the cytoplasm, and mature virions are released at the plasma membrane. Egress from the nucleus is a multifaceted process. In all herpesviruses studied, it involves the formation of a heterodimeric nuclear egress complex consisting of two viral proteins that are conserved throughout the herpesvirus family. One component is a type II transmembrane protein, tail-anchored in the nuclear envelope and termed pUL34 in herpes simplex virus 1 and pseudorabies virus. It interacts with a soluble component, pUL31, and recruits it to the nuclear envelope (9Fuchs W. Klupp B.G. Granzow H. Osterrieder N. Mettenleiter T.C.

In the absence of this complex, nuclear egress is blocked, and capsids accumulate in the nucleoplasm. One function of the pUL31-pUL34 complex is the recruitment of viral and cellular kinases that phosphorylate locally and disrupt the nuclear lamina (15Milbradt J. Auerochs S. Sticht H. Marschall M.

In addition, the pUL31-pUL34 complex might also contribute to the nuclear membrane restructuring necessary for herpesvirus nuclear egress. Transient or stable transgenic expression of pUL31 and pUL34 is sufficient to drive the formation of correctly sized primary envelopes in the perinuclear space between the outer and inner nuclear membrane in the absence of capsids (10Klupp B.G. Granzow H. Fuchs W. Keil G.M. Finke S. Mettenleiter T.C. Vesicle formation from the nuclear membrane is induced by coexpression of two conserved herpesvirus proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Virol. 2012; 86: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, pUL31 and pUL34 are the only two viral proteins required for budding and fission of vesicles at the inner nuclear membrane. Whether this process is additionally dependent on the recruitment and function of cellular factors is currently unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that, in vitro, pUL31 and pUL34 are sufficient to drive membrane budding and scission by forming a coat on the surface (21Bigalke J.M. Heuser T. Nicastro D. Heldwein E.E. Membrane deformation and scission by the HSV-1 nuclear egress complex.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, this assay depended on an unnaturally high content (up to 40%) of negatively charged lipid headgroups on the deformed lipid bilayer that is not present on physiological membranes. Therefore, it remains questionable to what extent it reflects the natural situation. Primary envelopment of herpesvirus capsids requires extensive restructuring of the host inner nuclear membrane to allow envelope formation and vesicle detachment into the lumen of the nuclear envelope. Similar membrane deformations have been investigated intensively because they are at the heart of vesicle-mediated intracellular trafficking in the secretory and endocytic pathways. Many such processes are directed by complex but conceptually straightforward mechanisms in which coat proteins impose a curvature on the cytosolic membrane face, thereby generating buds that ultimately constrict to vesicles. The best known coat proteins are clathrin and the COP I and COP II complexes, which assemble on the outer side of the membrane and are crucial for vesicle formation into the cytosol (22Kirchhausen T. Three ways to make a vesicle.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Membrane deformation in the opposite direction, i.e. away from the cytosol, such as the invagination of the endosomal membrane during formation of multivesicular bodies or egress of HIV and other enveloped viruses at the plasma membrane, both mediated by the ESCRT machinery, are less frequent (23Hurley J.H. Hanson P.I. Membrane budding and scission by the ESCRT machinery: it's all in the neck.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). pUL31-pUL34-mediated inner nuclear membrane engulfment, much like the suggested pathway for nuclear egress of large ribonucleoprotein complexes identified recently in Drosophila (24Speese S.D. Ashley J. Jokhi V. Nunnari J. Barria R. Li Y. Ataman B. Koon A. Chang Y.T. Li Q. Moore M.J. Budnik V. Nuclear envelope budding enables large ribonucleoprotein particle export during synaptic Wnt signaling.Cell. 2012; 149: 832-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), represents one of these exceptional pathways. It involves vesicle budding and scission from the nucleoplasm into the intermembrane space of the nuclear envelope, which is connected and topologically identical to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The molecular machinery mediating inner nuclear membrane deformation and scission remains largely obscure. It is especially unclear whether it requires proteins within the lumen of the nuclear envelope that could assemble a coat on the outer surface of the nascent vesicles, similar to COP I, COP II, and clathrin coats in the cytoplasm. We reconstituted the function of pseudorabies virus pUL31 and pUL34 in a simple membrane system by using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) 2The abbreviations used are: GUVgiant unilamellar vesicleDiDC181,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine,4-chlorobenzenesulfonate saltEGFPenhanced GFPNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidDGS1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid) succinylILVintralumenal vesicleCOPcoat protein complexESCRTendosomal sorting complex required for transportTEVtobacco etch virus. mimicking the lipid composition of the nuclear envelope. We show that the two viral proteins are sufficient for budding and fission of membrane vesicles into the lumen of GUVs, a process that is topologically identical to inwardly directed vesicle formation at the inner nuclear membrane during herpesvirus nuclear egress. Artificial membrane recruitment of pUL31 alone results in the same membrane remodelling and generates intra-GUV vesicles. Therefore, pUL31 and pUL34 are sufficient for vesicle formation without the need for additional (cellular) proteins. Moreover, we can assign distinct functions to pUL31 and pUL34 during herpesvirus nuclear egress. pUL34 recruits pUL31 to the membrane and provides membrane anchorage, whereas pUL31 mediates membrane budding and scission. giant unilamellar vesicle 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine,4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt enhanced GFP nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid) succinyl intralumenal vesicle coat protein complex endosomal sorting complex required for transport tobacco etch virus. 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine,4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt (DiDC18), Alexa Fluor 546 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester, and cascade blue-labeled neutravidin were obtained from Invitrogen, naphtopyrene from Sigma, and detergents from Calbiochem. The nuclear envelope lipid mix consisted of 5 mol% cholesterol, 2.5 mol% sphingomyeline, 2.5 mol% sodium phosphatidylserine, 10 mol% sodium phosphatidylinositol, 20 mol% phosphatidylethanolamine, and 60 mol% phosphatidylcholine (all from Avanti Polar Lipids). In lipid mixtures lacking a specific component, the respective lipid was replaced by an equimolar amount of phosphatidylcholine. Constructs for expression of pseudorabies virus pUL31 and pUL34 were generated from a synthetic DNA optimized for codon usage in Escherichia coli (Geneart). pUL31 was expressed from a modified pET28a vector with a His6 tag and a TEV site, followed by an EGFP protein amino-terminal of pUL31. The soluble domain of pUL34 (amino acids 1–240), untagged pUL31, as well as EGFP were expressed from a modified pET28a vector with a His6 tag followed by a TEV site. For C-terminal His6 tagging of the soluble domain of pUL34 (amino acids 1–240), the fragment was expressed from a modified pET28a vector lacking the amino-terminal His6 sequence. GST fusions of pUL31 and pUL34 (amino acids 1–240) were expressed from a modified pET28a vector lacking a His6 tag but with an N-terminal GST tag followed by a recognition site for precision protease upstream of pUL31 and pUL34. All His6-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21de3 and purified using Ni-NTA. Where applicable, the His6 tags were cleaved off. Proteins were purified further by gel filtration (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare). GST fusions were purified using GSH-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Full-length pUL34 and SCL1 were expressed from a modified pET28a vector with an N-terminal membrane-integrating sequence for translation of integral membrane protein constructs (MISTIC) fragment (25Roosild T.P. Greenwald J. Vega M. Castronovo S. Riek R. Choe S. NMR structure of Mistic, a membrane-integrating protein for membrane protein expression.Science. 2005; 307: 1317-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) followed by a thrombin cleavage site and purified as described previously (26Theerthagiri G. Eisenhardt N. Schwarz H. Antonin W. The nucleoporin Nup188 controls passage of membrane proteins across the nuclear pore complex.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 189: 1129-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Proteins were labeled using Alexa Fluor 546 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester in 200 mm NaHCO3 (pH 8.4) or the same buffer containing 1% (w/v) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide for labeling of transmembrane proteins and purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex G50 fine column (GE Healthcare). Detergent-solubilized and labeled SCL1 and pUL34 were reconstituted in proteoliposomes via gel filtration (27Eisenhardt N. Redolfi J. Antonin W. Interaction of Nup53 with Ndc1 and Nup155 is required for nuclear pore complex assembly.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 908-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For this, 20 μl of the nuclear envelope lipid mix (30 mg/ml in 10% octylglucopyranoside) was mixed with 20 μl of 2 μm pUL34 or SCL1 protein and 100 μl of PBS. The sample was applied to a Sephadex G50 fine filled Econo chromatography column (0.5 × 20 cm, Bio-Rad) to remove the detergent. The formed proteoliposomes were collected and pelleted for 30 min at 100,000 rpm in a TLA120.2 (Beckman Coulter) rotor at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 120 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT. 5 μl of resuspended proteoliposomes were dried onto two 5 × 5 mm platinum gauzes (ALS) under vacuum for at least 1 h at room temperature. The gauzes were placed in parallel (5 mm distance) into a cuvette (UVette, Eppendorf) and submerged in 259 mm sucrose solution, and for 140 min an alternating current electric field with 10 Hz, 2.2 V was applied, followed by 20 min at 2 Hz at 42 °C. Lipid GUVs were generated from chloroform-dissolved lipid mixtures where indicated, supplemented with 1 mol% Ni-NTA-DGS (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid)succinyl), Avanti Polar Lipids) and 0.8 nm DiDC18 as described previously (28Angelova M.I. Dimitrov D.S. Liposome electroformation.Faraday Discuss. 1986; 81: 303-311Crossref Google Scholar). An 8-well glass observation chamber (chambered #1.0 borosilicate coverglass system, Lab-Tek) was blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA in PBS and washed with PBS. For each reaction, 50 μl of freshly prepared GUVs were mixed with 150 μl of PBS and placed into a well. Unless indicated otherwise, all soluble proteins were added to a final concentration of 500 nm (cascade blue-labeled neutravidin at 3.8 μm). The proteins and buffers used for GUV preparation matched the osmotic pressure of the sucrose solution, as measured using an osmometer. The mixture was incubated for 5 min and imaged immediately at room temperature on an inverted Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal laser-scanning system utilizing an UPlanSApo ×60/1.35 oil objective. The cascade blue-labeled neutravidin was excited by a 405-nm diode pumped solid state laser, and emission was collected between 425–475 nm. EGFP and Alexa Fluor 546 were excited by an argon ion laser at 488 and 515 nm, respectively. Emission for EGFP was collected between 500–545 nm and between 570–625 nm for Alexa Fluor 546. DiD was excited by a 635-nm DPSS laser, and emission was collected between 655–755 nm. The pinhole was set to 1 airy unit. Three-dimensional reconstructions were generated using Imaris software (version 7.4, Bitplane). Linescan analysis was performed using FIJI software (Fiji.sc/Fiji). Size quantification was done by stack analysis of GUVs using a stack size of 0.5 μm. Supported lipid bilayers were prepared as described previously (29Unsay J.D. Cosentino K. Subburaj Y. García-Sáez A.J. Cardiolipin effects on membrane structure and dynamics.Langmuir. 2013; 29: 15878-15887Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The nuclear envelope lipid mix with 0.2 mol % Rhodamine-PE was dissolved in SLB buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. 20 μl of the mixture was diluted with 150 μl of SLB buffer. The suspension was then vortexed and bath-sonicated until a clear suspension was obtained, indicating that small unilamellar vesicles had formed. The clear solution was put in contact, at 37 °C, with freshly cleaved mica glued to a coverslip. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 3 mm and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The samples were rinsed several times with SLB buffer to remove CaCl2 and unfused vesicles and then allowed to equilibrate at room temperature before analysis. Supported lipid bilayers were imaged using a commercial LSM 710 (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at 22 °C. The excitation light of a DPSS laser at 561 nm and of an argon laser at 488 nm was reflected by a dichroic mirror (main beam splitter 488/561/633) and focused through a Zeiss C-Apochromat ×40, numerical aperture 1.2 water immersion objective onto the sample. The fluorescence emission was collected by the objective and directed by spectral beam guides to photomultiplier tube detectors. Images were acquired before and adding His6-EGFP-pUL31 or His6-EGFP at the same areas of the supported lipid bilayers. Images were analyzed using FIJI (particle analysis). Proteins were added to a final concentration of 500 nm. Supported lipid bilayers were imaged using a JPK NanoWizard II system (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) mounted on an Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss). Intermittent contact (or tapping) mode images were taken using V-shaped silicon nitride cantilevers (SNL-10) with a typical spring constant of 0.08 N/m and a nominal tip radius of 2 nm. The cantilever oscillation was tuned to a frequency between 3–10 kHz, and the amplitude was set between 0.3–0.6 V. The amplitude was varied during the experiment to minimize the force of the tip on the bilayer. The scan rate was set to 0.7–1 Hz. The height, deflection, and phase shift signals were collected simultaneously in both trace and retrace directions. Atomic force microscopy images were acquired before and after adding 150 nm His6-EGFP-pUL31 or His6-EGFP on the bilayer. Atomic force microscopy images were analyzed using JPK data analysis software. Viral pUL31 and pUL34 are necessary for nuclear egress of herpesvirus capsids. To investigate their function in detail, we expressed the transmembrane protein pUL34 in E. coli as a full-length protein, including its transmembrane region, and, after purification, labeled it with the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 546 before reconstitution into liposomes with a nuclear envelope-like lipid composition (30Kleinig H.

GUVs were generated from these proteoliposomes. The GUV membrane contained pUL34 as an integral membrane component, which can be detected by its fluorescent label (Fig. 1A). The vast majority of these GUVs were large vesicles with no detectable membrane/vesicle structures in the interior. When added to pUL34-GUVs, purified recombinant EGFP-pUL31 was efficiently recruited to the membranes (Fig. 1B), consistent with a direct pUL31-pUL34 interaction (9Fuchs W. Klupp B.G. Granzow H.

In the presence of pUL31, the GUV membrane was deformed and invaginated, leading to small intralumenal vesicles inside the GUVs that contained both pUL31 and pUL34. In typically sized GUVs with a diameter of 30–40 μm, ∼15 intralumenal vesicles were detected, the majority of them 0.5–2 μm in size (Fig. 1, D–F). Formation of intralumenal vesicles was specific for pUL31 because it was not induced by addition of EGFP alone. The same result was observed in different buffer systems and with untagged pUL31, confirming that the EGFP tag did not cause this effect. 3M. Lorenz, B. Vollmer, J. D. Unsay, B. G. Klupp, A. J. García-Sáez, T. C. Mettenleiter, and W. Antonin, unpublished observations. As a control, we replaced pUL34 with the inner nuclear membrane protein SCL1/BC08 (32Ulbert S. Platani M. Boue S. Mattaj I.W. Direct membrane protein-DNA interactions required early in nuclear envelope assembly.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Like pUL34, SCL1 is a type II transmembrane protein with a single membrane-spanning domain at its C terminus. Therefore, the N-terminal region preceding the transmembrane domain of both pUL34 and SCL1 faces the nucleoplasm. EGFP-pUL31 was not recruited to SCL1-GUVs, and membrane invaginations were not observed above background levels, demonstrating that this process specifically requires pUL31 and pUL34 (Fig. 1B). Cascade blue-labeled neutravidin was used as a fluid phase marker to assess permeability between the bulk solution and the pUL31-induced vesicles. When the fluid phase marker was added as a soluble probe, together with pUL31, to pUL34-GUVs, the label was found in intralumenal vesicles (Fig. 1G, top row). When added 20 min after pUL31 addition, intra-GUV vesicles without the fluid phase marker were detected (Fig. 1G, bottom row). Therefore, the lumina of vesicles are disconnected from the bulk solution surrounding the GUVs, indicating membrane scission. This is consistent with the three-dimensional reconstitution of an EGFP-pUL31-treated pUL34-GUV that shows highly mobile vesicles distant and apparently detached from the limiting GUV membrane (Fig. 1H). When the fluid phase marker was added to SCL1-GUVs together with EGFP-pUL31 (Fig. 1G) or to pUL34-GUVs in the absence of EGFP-pUL31,3 no intra-GUV fluorescence was detected, consistent with the notion that the pUL31-pUL34 interaction specifically induces vesicle budding into the GUV lumen. These data show that, in a minimal membrane system, the two viral proteins pUL31 and pUL34 are sufficient to induce membrane perturbations generating intra-GUV vesicles. Importantly, in our assay, pUL34 is integrated as a transmembrane protein into the GUV lipid bilayer, mimicking the natural situation at the nuclear envelope membranes. The restructuring of the GUV-limiting membrane is reminiscent of the inwardly directed primary vesicle formation into the lumen of the nuclear envelope during herpesvirus nuclear egress. The emerging buds were enriched in pUL31 and pUL34, indicating that both proteins accumulate at sites of membrane deformation (Fig. 1I), consistent with a role in this process. Therefore, this GUV system is a valuable tool to investigate pUL31-pUL34-mediated vesicle budding and scission in detail. Many membrane-deforming processes, including budding of several viruses at the plasma membrane, specifically involve integral membrane proteins (33Voeltz G.K. Prinz W.A. Shibata Y. Rist J.M.

Plant growth hormones such as cytokinin regulate and delay leaf senescence. Here, the structural gene (IPT) encoding the cytokinin biosynthetic enzyme isopentenyltransferase was fused to a functionally active fragment of the AtMYB32 promoter and was transformed into canola plants. Expression of the AtMYB32xs::IPT gene cassette delayed the leaf senescence in transgenic plants grown under controlled environment conditions and field experiments conducted for a single season at two geographic locations. The transgenic canola plants retained higher chlorophyll levels for an extended period and produced significantly higher seed yield with similar growth and phenology compared to wild type and null control plants under rainfed and irrigated treatments. The yield increase in transgenic plants was in the range of 16% to 23% and 7% to 16% under rainfed and irrigated conditions, respectively, compared to control plants. Most of the seed quality parameters in transgenic plants were similar, and with elevated oleic acid content in all transgenic lines and higher oil content and lower glucosinolate content in one specific transgenic line as compared to control plants. The results suggest that by delaying leaf senescence using the AtMYB32xs::IPT technology, productivity in crop plants can be improved under water stress and well-watered conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2155413046,"Objective Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is reported to inhibit bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal transduction. MGP deficiency is associated with medial calcification of the arterial wall, in a process that involves both osteogenic transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and mesenchymal transition of endothelial cells (EndMT). In this study, we investigated the contribution of BMP signal transduction to the medial calcification that develops in MGP-deficient mice. Approach and Results MGP-deficient mice (MGP-/-) were treated with one of two BMP signaling inhibitors, LDN-193189 or ALK3-Fc, beginning one day after birth. Aortic calcification was assessed in 28-day-old mice by measuring the uptake of a fluorescent bisphosphonate probe and by staining tissue sections with Alizarin red. Aortic calcification was 80% less in MGP-/- mice treated with LDN-193189 or ALK3-Fc compared with vehicle-treated control animals (P<0.001 for both). LDN-193189-treated MGP-/- mice survived longer than vehicle-treated MGP-/- mice. Levels of phosphorylated Smad1/5 and Id1 mRNA (markers of BMP signaling) did not differ in the aortas from MGP-/- and wild-type mice. Markers of EndMT and osteogenesis were increased in MGP-/- aortas, an effect that was prevented by LDN-193189. Calcification of isolated VSMCs was also inhibited by LDN-193189. Conclusions Inhibition of BMP signaling leads to reduced vascular calcification and improved survival in MGP-/- mice. The EndMT and osteogenic transdifferentiation associated with MGP deficiency is dependent upon BMP signaling. These results suggest that BMP signal transduction has critical roles in the development of vascular calcification in MGP-deficient mice."

Moreover, some bacteria, such as the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803, are capable of producing the cyclic nucleotide cGMP (7.Ochoa de Alda J.A.G. Ajlani G. Houmard J.

A detailed biochemical characterization of DisA revealed that the nucleotide-binding domain of the protein is a diadenylate cyclase (DAC) that converts two molecules of ATP to c-di-AMP (9.Witte G.

It was also observed that the DAC activity of DisA is strongly inhibited by the presence of non-standard DNA secondary structures like Holliday junctions (9.Witte G. Hartung S. Büttner K.

A recent study emphasized a function of DisA in controlling genome replication during outgrowth of B. subtilis spores to prevent propagation of damaged DNA to the germinating cells (12.Campos S.S.

Zhou X. Ding X. Eisele L.E. Bai G.

It is interesting to note that some bacteria possess more than one DAC-containing protein (14.Corrigan R.M. Gründling A. Cyclic di-AMP: another second messenger enters the fray.Nat. Rev.

Signal. 2008; 1: pe39Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition to the disA gene, the genome of B. subtilis harbors the cdaA and cdaS genes that code for the DACs CdaA and CdaS, respectively (17.Mehne F.M. Gunka K. Eilers H. Herzberg C. Kaever V.

Chem. 2013; 288: 2004-2017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Whereas the disA and cdaA genes are both constitutively expressed during vegetative growth, the cdaS gene encodes the sporulation-specific DAC CdaS that was shown to be required for efficient germination of B. subtilis spores (18.Mehne F.M. Schröder-Tittmann K. Eijlander R.T. Herzberg C. Hewitt L. Kaever V. Lewis R.J. Kuipers O.P. Tittmann K. Stülke J.

Although c-di-AMP was discovered only recently, several targets have been identified that bind to the signaling nucleotide. The first target that was shown to bind c-di-AMP is the DNA-binding transcription factor DarR from Mycobacterium smegmatis (19.Zhang L. Li W. He Z.G.

Chem. 2013; 288: 3085-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cyclic di-AMP stimulates the DNA-binding activity of DarR, which in its nucleotide-bound form acts as a repressor and prevents transcription of three target genes. In three recent systematic approaches, several additional protein targets of c-di-AMP that are widely distributed among other bacteria were identified in Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and B. subtilis (20.Corrigan R.M.

Moreover, c-di-AMP is capable of binding to a conserved riboswitch that controls the expression of the ydaO and ktrAB genes (24.Nelson J.W. Sudarsan N. Furukawa K. Weinberg Z. Wang J.X. Breaker R.R.

As stated above, c-di-AMP also directly controls potassium uptake (20.Corrigan R.M. Campeotto I. Jeganathan T. Roelofs K.G. Lee V.T. Gründling A.

Thus, c-di-AMP is the first signaling molecule that regulates the expression of a gene and controls the activity of the encoded protein. The growing resistance of pathogenic bacteria to the majority of antibiotics that are used in both community and health care settings is an enormous threat to infected patients (27.Bassetti M.

Moreover, some isolates of S. aureus are even resistant to multiple antibiotics (29.Diep B.A. Chambers H.F. Graber C.J. Szumowski J.D. Miller L.G. Han L.L. Chen J.H. Lin J. Phan T.H. Carleton H.A.

Fix the antibiotics pipeline.Nature. 2011; 472: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is an urgent demand for the identification of essential targets in bacterial pathogens that are suitable for the development of novel antibiotic substances to fight multiresistant isolates (32.Bumann D. Has nature already identified all useful antibacterial targets?.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As described above, c-di-AMP plays a central role in bacterial physiology. In several bacteria, c-di-AMP homeostasis seems to be also crucial for cell wall metabolism, cell division, and cell size control (17.Mehne F.M. Gunka K. Eilers H. Herzberg C. Kaever V. Stülke J.

The observation that CdaA is essential and that c-di-AMP does not exist in humans makes the DAC an excellent target for novel antibiotics. So far, only the structures of the DACs DisA and CdaS from Thermotoga maritima and Bacillus cereus, respectively, are available (9.Witte G. Hartung S. Büttner K. Hopfner K.P.

The SWISS-MODEL repository and associated ressources.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D387-D392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). By contrast, no structure of a DAC is available that belongs to the most abundant CdaA family. However, structural information about these DACs is crucial because they are highly conserved and essential in many pathogens (14.Corrigan R.M. Gründling A. Cyclic di-AMP: another second messenger enters the fray.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the structural and biochemical characterization of a truncated variant of the L. monocytogenes DAC CdaA. The structural characterization of CdaA might be helpful for in silico and in vitro screenings to identify compounds that specifically inhibit the essential enzyme. Unlike other DACs, CdaA activity seems to strictly depend on manganese or cobalt ions. The Escherichia coli strains DH5α (40.Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) were used for cloning procedures and for protein overproduction, respectively. E. coli was grown in LB medium, and transformants were selected on LB plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and 17 g/liter Bacto agar (Difco). The L. monocytogenes wild-type strain EGD-e (laboratory collection) was cultivated in BHI medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Transformation of E. coli was performed using standard procedures (40.Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was extracted using the Nucleospin extraction kit (Macherey and Nagel, Düren, Germany). Commercially available restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and DNA polymerases were used as recommended by the manufacturers. DNA fragments were purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (SeqLab, Göttingen, Germany). Chromosomal DNA of L. monocytogenes was isolated as described previously (41.Monk I.R. Gahan C.G. Hill C. Tools for functional postgenomic analysis of Listeria monocytogenes.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 3921-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To assess the biochemical activity of the DAC CdaA from L. monocytogenes, the enzyme was produced in E. coli BL21(DE3). For this purpose, the truncated cdaA (lmo2120) alleles Δ240cdaA and Δ300cdaA, lacking the nucleotides 1–240 and 1–300, respectively, were amplified using the primer pairs JR07 (5′-AAAGAGCTCGTTCCAACCGGAATTACGCCG)/JR08 (5′-TTTGGATCCTCATTCGCTTTTGCCTCCTTTC) and iGEM9 (5′-AAAGGCGCCATGGCACAAAAAACATTTAAA)/iGEM10 (5′-AAAGGATCCTTACTCGCCGAGTCCTTCGCTTTTCAT), respectively. Chromosomal DNA of the L. monocytogenes wild-type strain EGD-e served as the template. The PCR products were cloned between the SacI and BamHI sites of the expression vector pGP172 (42.Merzbacher M. Detsch C. Hillen W. Stülke J. Mycoplasma pneumoniae HPr kinase/phosphorylase.Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids pBP119 and pBP33 encode the N-terminally truncated DACs Δ80CdaA and Δ100CdaA, respectively, lacking the first 80 and 100 amino acids, and carry an N-terminal Strep-tag for affinity purification. To identify the amino acid residues involved in the reaction catalyzed by the truncated DAC, we generated the cdaA mutant alleles G511A, G515C, and C604A/G605T using the combined chain reaction (43.Bi W. Stambrook P.J. CCR: a rapid and simple approach for mutation detection.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2949-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For this purpose, a truncated cdaA gene lacking nucleotides 1–240 was amplified from chromosomal DNA of L. monocytogenes EGD-e using the primer pair JR07/JR08 and the mutagenic primer JR18 (5′-P-GAATACACCGCTTCATAATGGAGCAGTTATTATTAA), JR19 (5′-P-CGCTTCATGATGCAGCAGTTATTATTAAAGGA), or JR21 (5′-P-AAAGAACTTGGAAATCGTCACCGGGC). The combined chain reaction products were cloned between the SacI and BamHI sites of plasmid pGP172 (42.Merzbacher M. Detsch C. Hillen W. Stülke J. Mycoplasma pneumoniae HPr kinase/phosphorylase.Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), giving plasmids pBP124 (Δ240cdaA (G511A)), pBP125 (Δ240cdaA(G515C)), and pBP126 (Δ240cdaA(C604/G605T)). The plasmids pBP124, pBP125, and pBP126 encode the N-terminally truncated mutant variants Δ80CdaA(D171N), Δ80CdaA(G172A), and Δ80CdaA(T202N), respectively, that harbor N-terminal Strep-tags for affinity purification. The numbers of residues indicated in the truncated DAC variants correspond to the full-length CdaA protein (UniProt code Q8Y5E4). Intracellular c-di-AMP pools were determined by the liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method (18.Mehne F.M. Schröder-Tittmann K. Eijlander R.T. Herzberg C. Hewitt L.

E. coli BL21(DE3) was used as the host for the production of the truncated protein that was purified using the Streptactin:Strep-tag purification system. The cultures were grown in 1 liter of LB medium at 37 °C. Gene expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 1 mm) to logarithmically growing cultures (A600 of 0.5). Cells were collected 3 h after induction, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 8 ml of disruption buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The cells were disrupted by using a French press (18,000 p.s.i., 138,000 kilopascals; Spectronic Instruments, G. Heinemann, Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany), and the crude extracts were passed over a 1-ml Streptactin column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). The column was washed five times with 2.5 ml of disruption buffer, and the proteins were eluted from the column with 2.5 ml of elution buffer containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin (Sigma-Aldrich). The Bio-Rad dye-binding assay was used to determine the protein concentrations. Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. The in vitro DAC activity assays were carried out in buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Depending on the assay conditions, different amounts of ATP/MgCl2 (equimolar), divalent metal ions, and purified DAC were mixed to a final volume of 400 μl in 1.5-ml reaction tubes. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with agitation. Reactions were stopped by heating the samples for 5 min at 95 °C. Next, the samples were incubated for 5 min on ice and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,800 × g and 4 °C. 350 μl of the supernatant were added to 1.4 ml of extraction solution (acetonitrile/methanol mixture (1:1, v/v)). The extraction mixture was stored at −20 °C overnight. Samples were then centrifuged at 20,800 × g and 4 °C, and then the supernatants were transferred to fresh vials and dried in a SpeedVac. The dried supernatants were solved with 100 or 200 μl of H2O (depending on the expected amount of c-di-AMP). After repeated centrifugation and the addition of the internal standard 13C,15N-c-di-AMP, part of the supernatants was analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Crosslinking experiments were performed with glutardialdehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) to study the multimerization of the DAC. For this purpose, 50 pmol of the purified protein were incubated with 0–0.2% glutardialdehyde for 1 h at room temperature. The cross-linking reactions were quenched by the addition of glycine (Sigma-Aldrich) to a final concentration of 200 mm. Subsequently, the samples were heated for 10 min at 95 °C in Laemmli buffer. Finally, the proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining as described previously (45.Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Improved silver staining of plant proteins, RNA and DNA in polyacrylamide gels.Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3741) Google Scholar). The oligomerization status of the DACs Δ80CdaA and Δ100CdaA was determined by SEC-MALS using a setup of an S75 Superdex 10/300GL on an Äkta purifier (both from GE Healthcare) subsequent to a degasser (model 2003 from Biotech AB, Onsala, Sweden) for the buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium-chloride) in line with a miniDawn Treos multiangle light scattering system followed by an Optilab T-rEX RI detector (both from Wyatt Technology Europe). Data analysis was performed using the ASTRA version 6.1 software (Wyatt Technology). The CdaA DAC domain was subjected to initial crystallization trials at a concentration of 9.4 mg/ml with a 5-fold molar excess of ATP. Best diffracting crystals grew in 6–16% 1,6-hexanediol, 2 mm spermine, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m Na-PIPES, pH 7.5. The oscillation images were collected at PETRA III (Beamline P13, EMBL, Hamburg, Germany) and processed with XDS (46.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (11294) Google Scholar). The scaling process revealed a tetragonal lattice and unit cell parameters of a = b = 130.7 Å, c = 178.2 Å, α = β = γ = 90.00°. Systematic absences indicated the space group to be either P43212 or P41212.

Here we aimed to quantify physiological responses to graded intakes of a specific dietary fibre (pectin) in an animal model. Four isocaloric semi-purified diets containing 0, 3.3%, 6.7% or 10% w/w apple pectin were offered ad libitum for 8 or 28 days to young adult male rats (n = 8/group). Measurements were made of voluntary food intake, body weight, initial and final body composition by magnetic resonance imaging, final gut regional weights and histology, and final plasma satiety hormone concentrations. In both 8- and 28-day cohorts, dietary pectin inclusion rate was negatively correlated with food intake, body weight gain and the change in body fat mass, with no effect on lean mass gain. In both cohorts, pectin had no effect on stomach weight but pectin inclusion rate was positively correlated with weights and lengths of small intestine and caecum, jejunum villus height and crypt depth, ileum crypt depth, and plasma total glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) concentrations, and at 8 days was correlated with weight and length of colon and with caecal mucosal depth. Therefore, the gut’s morphological and endocrine adaptations were dose-dependent, occurred within 8 days and were largely sustained for 28 days during continued dietary intervention. Increasing amounts of the soluble fermentable fibre pectin in the diet proportionately decreased food intake, body weight gain and body fat content, associated with proportionately increased satiety hormones GLP-1 and PYY and intestinal hypertrophy, supporting a role for soluble dietary fibre-induced satiety in healthy body weight regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2162287976,"Vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes several proteins that inhibit activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). VACV protein A49 prevents translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus by sequestering cellular β-TrCP, a protein required for the degradation of the inhibitor of κB. A49 does not share overall sequence similarity with any protein of known structure or function. We solved the crystal structure of A49 from VACV Western Reserve to 1.8 Å resolution and showed, surprisingly, that A49 has the same three-dimensional fold as Bcl-2 family proteins despite lacking identifiable sequence similarity. Whereas Bcl-2 family members characteristically modulate cellular apoptosis, A49 lacks a surface groove suitable for binding BH3 peptides and does not bind proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bax or Bak. The N-terminal 17 residues of A49 do not adopt a single well ordered conformation, consistent with their proposed role in binding β-TrCP. Whereas pairs of A49 molecules interact symmetrically via a large hydrophobic surface in crystallo, A49 does not dimerize in solution or in cells, and we propose that this hydrophobic interaction surface may mediate binding to a yet undefined cellular partner. A49 represents the eleventh VACV Bcl-2 family protein and, despite these proteins sharing very low sequence identity, structure-based phylogenetic analysis shows that all poxvirus Bcl-2 proteins are structurally more similar to each other than they are to any cellular or herpesvirus Bcl-2 proteins. This is consistent with duplication and diversification of a single BCL2 family gene acquired by an ancestral poxvirus."
https://openalex.org/W2165198888,"The potato cyst nematode, Globodera rostochiensis, is an important pest of potato. Like other pathogens, plant parasitic nematodes are presumed to employ effector proteins, secreted into the apoplast as well as the host cytoplasm, to alter plant cellular functions and successfully infect their hosts. We have generated a library of ORFs encoding putative G. rostochiensis putative apoplastic effectors in vectors for expression in planta. These clones were assessed for morphological and developmental effects on plants as well as their ability to induce or suppress plant defenses. Several CLAVATA3/ESR-like proteins induced developmental phenotypes, whereas predicted cell wall-modifying proteins induced necrosis and chlorosis, consistent with roles in cell fate alteration and tissue invasion, respectively. When directed to the apoplast with a signal peptide, two effectors, an ubiquitin extension protein (GrUBCEP12) and an expansin-like protein (GrEXPB2), suppressed defense responses including NB-LRR signaling induced in the cytoplasm. GrEXPB2 also elicited defense response in species- and sequence-specific manner. Our results are consistent with the scenario whereby potato cyst nematodes secrete effectors that modulate host cell fate and metabolism as well as modifying host cell walls. Furthermore, we show a novel role for an apoplastic expansin-like protein in suppressing intra-cellular defense responses."

Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor of atrial fibrillation, but the ionic mechanism underlying this relationship remains unclear. We hypothesized that SK channel function is abnormal in diabetes mellitus, leading to altered cardiac electrophysiology. We found that in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, the expression of SK2 and SK3 isoforms was down-regulated by 85 and 92%, respectively, whereas that of SK1 was not changed. SK currents from isolated diabetic mouse atrial myocytes were significantly reduced compared with controls. The resting potentials of isolated atrial preparations were similar between control and diabetic mice, but action potential durations were significantly prolonged in the diabetic atria. Exposure to apamin significantly prolonged action potential durations in control but not in diabetic atria. Production of reactive oxygen species was significantly increased in diabetic atria and in high glucose-cultured HL-1 cells, whereas exposure of HL-1 cells in normal glucose culture to H2O2 reduced the expression of SK2 and SK3. Tyrosine nitration in SK2 and SK3 was significantly increased by high glucose culture, leading to accelerated channel turnover. Treatment with Tiron prevented these changes. Our results suggest that increased oxidative stress in diabetes results in SK channel-associated electrical remodeling in diabetic atria and may promote arrhythmogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2170402154,"Influenza B virus remains a major contributor to the seasonal influenza outbreak and its prevalence has increased worldwide. We investigated the epidemiology and analyzed the full genome sequences of influenza B virus strains in Thailand between 2010 and 2014. Samples from the upper respiratory tract were collected from patients diagnosed with influenza like-illness. All samples were screened for influenza A/B viruses by one-step multiplex real-time RT-PCR. The whole genome of 53 influenza B isolates were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. From 14,418 respiratory samples collected during 2010 to 2014, a total of 3,050 tested positive for influenza virus. Approximately 3.27% (471/14,418) were influenza B virus samples. Fifty three isolates of influenza B virus were randomly chosen for detailed whole genome analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed clusters in Victoria clades 1A, 1B, 3, 5 and Yamagata clades 2 and 3. Both B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages were found to co-circulate during this time. The NA sequences of all isolates belonged to lineage II and consisted of viruses from both HA Victoria and Yamagata lineages, reflecting possible reassortment of the HA and NA genes. No significant changes were seen in the NA protein. The phylogenetic trees generated through the analysis of the PB1 and PB2 genes closely resembled that of the HA gene, while trees generated from the analysis of the PA, NP, and M genes showed similar topology. The NS gene exhibited the pattern of genetic reassortment distinct from those of the PA, NP or M genes. Thus, antigenic drift and genetic reassortment among the influenza B virus strains were observed in the isolates examined. Our findings indicate that the co-circulation of two distinct lineages of influenza B viruses and the limitation of cross-protection of the current vaccine formulation provide support for quadrivalent influenza vaccine in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2003638303,"The bioenergetics of IF1 transiently silenced cancer cells has been extensively investigated, but the role of IF1 (the natural inhibitor protein of F1F0-ATPase) in cancer cell metabolism is still uncertain. To shed light on this issue, we established a method to prepare stably IF1-silenced human osteosarcoma clones and explored the bioenergetics of IF1 null cancer cells. We showed that IF1-silenced cells proliferate normally, consume glucose, and release lactate as controls do, and contain a normal steady-state ATP level. However, IF1-silenced cells displayed an enhanced steady-state mitochondrial membrane potential and consistently showed a reduced ADP-stimulated respiration rate. In the parental cells (i.e. control cells containing IF1) the inhibitor protein was found to be associated with the dimeric form of the ATP synthase complex, therefore we propose that the interaction of IF1 with the complex either directly, by increasing the catalytic activity of the enzyme, or indirectly, by improving the structure of mitochondrial cristae, can increase the oxidative phosphorylation rate in osteosarcoma cells grown under normoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2058421825,"Wheat bran offers health benefits as a baking ingredient, but is detrimental to bread textural quality. Dextran production by microbial fermentation improves sourdough bread volume and freshness, but extensive acid production during fermentation may negate this effect. Enzymatic production of dextran in wheat bran was tested to determine if dextran-containing bran could be used in baking without disrupting bread texture. The Weissella confusa VTT E-90392 dextransucrase gene was sequenced and His-tagged dextransucrase Wc392-rDSR was produced in Lactococcus lactis. Purified enzyme was characterized using 14C-sucrose radioisotope and reducing value-based assays, the former yielding Km and Vmax values of 14.7 mM and 8.2 μmol/(mg∙min), respectively, at the pH optimum of 5.4. The structure and size of in vitro dextran product was similar to dextran produced in vivo. Dextran (8.1% dry weight) was produced in wheat bran in 6 h using Wc392-rDSR. Bran with and without dextran was used in wheat baking at 20% supplementation level. Dextran presence improved bread softness and neutralized bran-induced volume loss, clearly demonstrating the potential of using dextransucrases in bran bioprocessing for use in baking."

Rescue experiments with ASA showed a normalization of the ratio of long versus short sulfatides, restored PDGFRα levels, corrected its localization to detergent-resistant membranes, increased AKT phosphorylation, and normalized the production of OLs in ASA-deficient NPs. Moreover, our studies identified a novel mechanism that regulates the secretion of PDGFRα in NPs, in glial cells, and in the brain cortex via exosomal shedding.

Spinal cord oligodendrocytes develop from ventrally derived progenitor cells that express PDGF α-receptors.Development. 1996; 122: 4085-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have highlighted the relevance of PDGFRα signaling in oligodendrogenesis. For example, PDGFRα+ cells isolated from the embryonic spinal cord exclusively generate myelinating oligodendrocytes (12Hall A. Giese N.A. Richardson W.D. Spinal cord oligodendrocytes develop from ventrally derived progenitor cells that express PDGF α-receptors.Development. 1996; 122: 4085-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pringle N.P. Mudhar H.S.

PDGF receptors in the CNS: during late neurogenesis, expression of PDGF alpha receptors appears to be restricted to glial cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage.Development. 1992; 115: 535-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the formation of mature OLs is significantly reduced upon ablation of PDGFRα+ cells (12Hall A. Giese N.A. Richardson W.D. Spinal cord oligodendrocytes develop from ventrally derived progenitor cells that express PDGF α-receptors.Development. 1996; 122: 4085-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in mice with targeted disruption of its ligand, PDGF-AA (14Fruttiger M.

Defective oligodendrocyte development and severe hypomyelination in PDGF-A knockout mice.Development. 1999; 126: 457-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functionally, the activity of PDGFRα depends in part on its localization to detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains in the plasma membrane and interaction with integrin complexes (15Baron W.

Previously, we found that exogenous sulfated galactosylceramides (sulfatides) significantly reduced the formation of OLs from NPs in vitro (18Givogri M.I. Bottai D. Zhu H.L. Fasano S. Lamorte G. Brambilla R. Vescovi A. Wrabetz L. Bongarzone E. Multipotential neural precursors transplanted into the metachromatic leukodystrophy brain fail to generate oligodendrocytes but contribute to limit brain dysfunction.Dev. Neurosci. 2008; 30: 340-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One interpretation from these results is that sulfatides might repress the sensitivity of OPCs to proliferating signals such as PDGF-AA, thereby reducing the pool of progenitors available for differentiation into mature OLs. Sulfatides are crucial sphingolipids in myelin architecture (19Bosio A. Binczek E. Haupt W.F. Stoffel W.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and have been found to negatively regulate the maturation of OPCs into differentiated OLs (20Bansal R. Winkler S. Bheddah S.

Sulfatide is a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation: development in sulfatide-null mice.Glia. 2004; 45: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but the mechanism is still unknown. Sphingolipids, including sulfatides, have structural and functional roles in DRMs (22Simons K. Ikonen E.

Therefore, sulfatides have an intrinsic potential to modulate the activity of membrane-bound receptors such as PDGFRα by altering membrane domains such as DRMs. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that sulfatides contribute to the regulation of oligodendrogenesis by modulating PDGFRα function. We found that increased sulfatide levels in NPs lead to a reduced production of OPCs and OLs. Furthermore, we observed a diminished association of PDGFRα with DRMs, repressed AKT phosphorylation, and exacerbated secretion of PDGFRα via exosomes. We present evidence that exosomal secretion of PDGFRα is a natural process in glial cells in vitro and during myelination of the murine cortex, when sulfatides are highly produced. Heterozygous ASA+/− breeders (obtained from Dr. Gieselmann and back-crossed in the C56BL/6 background) were maintained in standard housing conditions, under the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee. ASA+/+ and ASA−/− embryos at 16.5 days of gestation and 3-day-old newborns were used in our experiments. ASA+/+ and ASA−/− mice at 7, 14, and 21 days were killed without sex distinctions for immunocytochemical and in vivo exosome isolation studies. NPs were isolated from ASA+/+ and ASA−/− embryonic day 16.5 telencephalon by mechanical dissociation and maintained as proliferating spheres in the presence of 10 ng/ml FGF-2 and 20 ng/ml EGF (27Givogri M.I. de Planell M. Galbiati F. Superchi D. Gritti A. Vescovi A. de Vellis J. Bongarzone E.R. Notch signaling in astrocytes and neuroblasts of the adult subventricular zone in health and after cortical injury.Dev. Neurosci. 2006; 28: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Cultures of NPs obtained from different litters were used between passages 3 and 10 with identical results (n = 5–6). For differentiation assays, NPs were mechanically dissociated and seeded at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/cm2 onto coverslips precoated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Cultures were maintained for 3 or 7 days (3 or 7 DIV) in the absence of growth factors and in the presence of 2% fetal bovine serum (differentiated medium). Differentiated medium containing 2% FBS showed traces of Alix and Rab5B (data not shown). In some experiments, differentiated cells were exposed to PDGF-AA (Peprotech) at a concentration of 20 ng/ml for 1 day after plating. For Western blot analyses, NP spheres were collected 5 days after proliferation or 7 days after plating for differentiation. Analysis of proteolytic degradation of the PDGFRα were performed utilizing 2 × 106 dissociated ASA+/+ and ASA−/− NPs. NPs were exposed to 10 μm MG132 or 10 mm NH4CL in basal proliferating medium conditions. Cells incubated with MG132 or NH4Cl for 6 h were collected for protein expression analysis of the PDGFRα as described below (see “Immunoblotting”). Because MG132 was dissolved in DMSO, DMSO-treated ASA+/+ and ASA−/− NPs were included as controls. All experiments were repeated three times. Additionally, three independent experiments were performed exposing 4 × 106 dissociated ASA+/+ and ASA−/− NPs to PDGF-AA ligand at a concentration of 20 ng/ml for 30 min before cell collection. For these experiments, NPs were starved for 3 h of growth factors present in the proliferating medium (EGF and basic FGF) and exposed to MG132 or NH4Cl as described above. After starvation, NP metabolism was slowed down by an ice bath for 15 min, cells were pelleted, and medium was preserved on ice. Pelleted NPs were exposed to fresh medium containing PDGF-AA for 30 min on ice. Cells were pelleted and washed to remove unbound ligand and resuspended in their original medium with MG132 or NH4Cl for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. NPs were pelleted, washed with PBS, and collected for Western blot analysis. NP pellets were analyzed for PDGFRα and downstream signaling for AKT, phospho-AKT (Ser308 and Thr478), MAPK p42/44, and phospho-MAPK p42/44 (Thr202/Tyr204). For analysis of the effects of exogenous sulfatides (Avanti), ASA+/+ NP spheres were dissociated and incubated with two pulses of 10 μm sulfatides at days 1 and 3 and collected after 5 days. Primary glial cultures were prepared from ASA+/+ and ASA−/− as described previously (28Givogri M.I. Bongarzone E.R. Schonmann V. Campagnoni A.T. Expression and regulation of golli products of myelin basic protein gene during in vitro development of oligodendrocytes.J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions were seeded in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks coated with 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine at equal cell densities. Medium was changed 4 days after plating. Glial conditioned medium was collected at 7, 14, and 21 DIV and stored at −20 °C. CG4 cells were cultured as described previously (29Louis J.C. Muir D. Varon S. Autocrine inhibition of mitotic activity in cultured oligodendrocyte-type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) precursor cells.Glia. 1992; 6: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), except that B104 conditioned medium was replaced with 10 ng/ml PDGFA (BD Biosciences) and 5 ng/ml basic FGF (Peprotech). After 5 days in culture, supernatants were processed for exosomal isolation and cell pellets for Western blot analysis as described below. NP lysates (equivalent to 2 mg of protein) were equilibrated with a solution of 90% sucrose to give a final solution of 45% sucrose and subjected to ultracentrifugation using a sucrose gradient (24White A.B. Galbiati F. Givogri M.I. Lopez Rosas A. Qiu X. van Breemen R. Bongarzone E.R. Persistence of psychosine in brain lipid rafts is a limiting factor in the therapeutic recovery of a mouse model for Krabbe disease.J. Neurosci. Res. 2011; 89: 352-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Twelve 0.25-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cholesterol levels of ASA+/+ and ASA−/− NPs from each sucrose fraction (50 μl) were measured using the fluorometric Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Invitrogen). Fluorometric analysis was performed using the Beckman Coulter DTX 880 multimode detector. Sulfatides were extracted from total lysates of NP spheres at 5 days (ASA+/+, ASA−/−, and ASA−/− NPs treated with two pulses of 5, 15, or 25% ASA conditioned medium (ASACM) at day 1 and 3 of dissociated spheres) and DRM fractions (ASA+/+ and ASA−/− NPs) as described previously with some modifications (30Folch J.

Biochem. 2014; 467: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). C12:0 sulfatide was used as an internal standard (0.5 μm). Fifty-microliter aliquots from each sample were used for protein quantification. Ten volumes of chloroform/methanol (CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1, v/v)) were added to each sample and incubated with agitation at room temperature for 2 h. Each sample was filtered, and 0.2 volumes of 0.9% NaCl was added. Mixtures were vortexed and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The lower phase was dried under N2 at 45 °C. Lipid extracts were dissolved in CHCl3/0.6 n NaOH, CH3OH (1:1, v/v) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with agitation. Extracts were washed with water and centrifuged at 2000 rpm. The lower phase was retained, washed with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:48:47, v/v/v), and centrifuged at 2000 rpm. The lower phase was evaporated, and the dry product was dissolved in CHCl3 (500 ml/10 mg of product). Lipid extracts were fractionated on an SPE-NH2 column as described (33Bodennec J. Brichon G. Zwingelstein G. Portoukalian J. Purification of sphingolipid classes by solid-phase extraction with aminopropyl and weak cation exchanger cartridges.Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 101-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, upon activation with hexane, fractional elution was carried out, and sulfatides were eluted with CHCl3/CH3OH/3.6 m aqueous NH4C2H3O2 (30:60:8, v/v/v) (as a last fraction), dried with N2 at 45 °C, and stored at −20 °C until use. Samples were dissolved in 60 ml of 5 mm NH4HCO2 in CH3OH, and 2 ml were injected onto the UPLC column. The four major sulfatide isoforms enriched in white matter (C16:0, C18:0, C24:0, and C24:1) were analyzed using UHPLC-MS/MS on a Shimadzu Nexera/LCMS-8040 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Kyoto, Japan). A Waters Acquity UPLC C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 mm) was used to separate sulfatides. The following gradient was used: 0–3 min, from 65 to 83% A; 3–3.5 min, from 83 to 95% A, held at 95% A for 1.5 min (solvent A, CH3CN; solvent B, 5 mm NH4HCO2 in water, pH 4.5). The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min, the autosampler temperature was 20 °C, and the column oven temperature was 45 °C. All analyte measurements were done using negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation and selected reaction monitoring. Selected reaction monitoring transitions monitored were as follows: C12:0, m/z 722 to 97; C16:0, m/z 778 to 97; C18:0, m/z 806 to 97; C24:1, m/z 888 to 97; C24:0, m/z 890 to 97. Conditioned media from NPs (3 × 107 cells) and primary glial cultures (3 × 107) (n = 3 for each group) were filtered (0.22 μm) and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. Pellets were resuspended in cold PBS and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. Exosome pellets were dissolved in lysis buffer as described below, and equal amounts of proteins (4 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, followed by immunodetection of PDGFRα, EGFR, and the exosomal marker Rab-5b. Exosomes were isolated from ASA+/+ and ASA−/− brain cortices at 7, 14, and 21 days postnatal as described (34Perez-Gonzalez R. Gauthier S.A. Kumar A. Levy E. The exosome secretory pathway transports amyloid precursor protein carboxyl-terminal fragments from the cell into the brain extracellular space.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 43108-43115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The final exosomal pellet was subjected to a sucrose gradient centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. A total of seven fractions were collected (fraction a, top; fraction g, bottom). Fractions b, c, and d, enriched in the exosomal marker Rab-5b, were each resuspended in 40 μl of lysis buffer. Western blot analysis was performed on a half of the volume of each fraction. For transmission electron microscopy, exosomes were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and stained as described (35Thery C. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Clayton A. Isolation and characterization of exosomes from cell culture supernatants and biological fluids.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2006Crossref Google Scholar). Samples were imaged using a 120-kV transmission electron microscope, JEOL JEM-1220, and equipped with a Gatan Es1000W 11-megapixel CCD camera. The deficiency in ASA activity in ASA−/− NPs was rescued by cross-correction using ASA-supplemented cell medium (36Luca T. Givogri M.I. Perani L. Galbiati F. Follenzi A. Naldini L. Bongarzone E.R. Axons mediate the distribution of arylsulfatase A within the mouse hippocampus upon gene delivery.Mol. Ther. 2005; 12: 669-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, ASA-secreting HeLa cells were grown in 10% FCS DMEM/F-12 before conditioning. Cells were incubated with serum-free cell medium for 4 days. Conditioned media were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and kept frozen until use. For correction experiments, 5, 15, or 25% ASACM or 25% control medium (DMEM/F-12 medium) was added to ASA−/− NP culture medium. ASA activity was measured utilizing 4-methylumberyl sulfate derivative substrate as described by Porter et al. (37Porter M.T. Fluharty A.L. Kihara H. Metachromatic leukodystrophy: arylsulfatase-A deficiency in skin fibroblast cultures.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1969; 62: 887-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). RNA was purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript III (Invitrogen). SYBR Green-based real-time PCR analysis was performed using primers specific for the PDGFRα sequence. The 60 S acidic ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0) was used as an internal standard. Primers were optimized on a standard curve with an efficiency between 90 and 110% and a correlation coefficient higher than and 0.990. PCR analysis was calculated using the ΔΔCt method. The following primers were used: PDGFRα forward, 5′-ATATGATCTTTCTGTGGTTTAA-3′; reverse, 5′-CACTGCTTGGCAGAGCTACCT-3′; RPLP0 forward, 5′-CACGAAGCTAACGACTATCGC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCTAGGGACTCGTTCGTGC-3′. Samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, mammalian protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm okadaic acid, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) on ice for 30 min with vortexing at 10-min intervals. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g, 10 μg of protein/sample was loaded onto 4–12% 1.5-mm precast NuPage gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed using an XCell Sure-lock vertical electrophoresis system (Invitrogen). After transferring to nitrocellulose membrane, blots were blocked with milk/BSA solution and incubated with the relevant antibodies. Immunoreactive products were detected using peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and ECL chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Immunoblots were semiquantified using ImageJ analysis software (National Institutes of Health). For differentiation studies, cultures were maintained for 3 or 7 DIV in the absence of growth factors and in the presence of 2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed twice with PBS. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C, washed extensively with PBS, and then incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Coverslips or chamber slides were mounted with Prolong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) and imaged using either DM5500 Q Microscope with a Leica DFC500 camera or Zeiss Meta 510 confocal microscope. Cell counting was performed in the ImageJ software by counting cell-specific markers (NG2 for oligodendrocyte precursor cells, O4 for intermediate oligodendrocytes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytes, and DAPI for the nuclei). Three images of each coverslip or chamber slide were counted, and all experiments were repeated at least three times with different primary NPs cultures. The cell percentage was calculated for each specific marker with respect to total DAPI+ cells. Brains were collected after perfusion with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde. Sections were cryoprotected in 20% sucrose, embedded in OCT, and sectioned at 20 μm on a cryostat. Tissue sections were immunostained for myelin basic protein (MBP) and PDGFRα and developed using the diaminobenzidine-ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). The following antibodies were used in this study: actin (1:3000; Sigma), AKT (1:1000; Cell Signaling), Alix (1:500; Millipore), ASA (1:750; a gift from Dr. V. Gieselmann, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms University, Bonn, Germany), caveolin 1 (1:1000; Cell signaling), EGFR (1:500; Upstate), p44/42 MAPK (1:2000; Cell Signaling), flotillin 2 (1:2000; BD Biosciences), GFAP (1:1000; Millipore), MBP (1:500; a gift from Dr. E.

Data were analyzed by Student’s t test or one-way analysis of variance, considering a p value of <0.05 as significant. Results are given as the means ± S.E. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0d (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Previous studies performed in ASA−/− animals during the peak of myelination showed a delayed expression of mRNA for myelin proteins: MBP, myelin and lymphocyte protein, and PLP, which suggests a defect in the differentiation program of OLs in the ASA−/− context (38Yaghootfam A. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. Delay of myelin formation in arylsulphatase A-deficient mice.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have examined the expression of PDGFRα and MBP by immunohistochemistry in the cortex of ASA+/+ and ASA−/− mice during the period of active myelination at postnatal days 7, 14, and 21 (Fig. 1, A and B). Our analysis showed a reduced content of the PDGFRα (Fig. 1A) and MBP (Fig. 1B) in the ASA−/− cortex. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed the immunohistochemical findings. PDGFRα protein levels were significantly reduced in the mutant cortex at all ages examined (Fig. 1, C and F). MBP (Fig. 1, D and F) and PLP (Fig. 1E) were also significantly reduced in the ASA−/− brain. To better understand the possible effect of ASA deficiency on the production of OLs, multipotential NPs were isolated"

We found that ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) either positively or negatively regulates dendritic spine formation depending on neuronal maturation and activity. ARF6 activation increased the spine formation in developing neurons, whereas it decreased spine density in mature neurons. Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed that ARF6 activation in each stage leads to opposite patterns of expression of a subset of genes that are involved in neuronal morphology. ARF6-mediated Rac1 activation via the phospholipase D pathway is the coincident factor in both stages, but the antagonistic RhoA pathway becomes involved in the mature stage. Furthermore, blocking neuronal activity in developing neurons using tetrodotoxin or enhancing the activity in mature neurons using picrotoxin or chemical long term potentiation reversed the effect of ARF6 on each stage. Thus, activity-dependent dynamic changes in ARF6-mediated spine structures may play a role in structural plasticity of mature neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2086187792,"The membrane-anchored metalloproteinase a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) is required for shedding of membrane proteins such as EGF, betacellulin, the amyloid precursor protein, and CD23 from cells. ADAM10 is constitutively active and can be rapidly and post-translationally enhanced by several stimuli, yet little is known about the underlying mechanism. Here, we use ADAM10-deficient cells transfected with wild type or mutant ADAM10 to address the role of its cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain in regulating ADAM10-dependent protein ectodomain shedding. We report that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM10 negatively regulates its constitutive activity through an ER retention motif but is dispensable for its stimulated activity. However, chimeras with the extracellular domain of ADAM10 and the transmembrane domain of ADAM17 with or without the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17 show reduced stimulated shedding of the ADAM10 substrate betacellulin, whereas the ionomycin-stimulated shedding of the ADAM17 substrates CD62-L and TGFα is not affected. Moreover, we show that influx of extracellular calcium activates ADAM10 but is not essential for its activation by APMA and BzATP. Finally, the rapid stimulation of ADAM10 is not significantly affected by incubation with proprotein convertase inhibitors for up to 8 h, arguing against a major role of increased prodomain removal in the rapid stimulation of ADAM10. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM10 negatively influences constitutive shedding through an ER retention motif, whereas the cytoplasmic domain and prodomain processing are not required for the rapid activation of ADAM10-dependent shedding events.

However, chimeras with the extracellular domain of ADAM10 and the transmembrane domain of ADAM17 with or without the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM17 show reduced stimulated shedding of the ADAM10 substrate betacellulin, whereas the ionomycin-stimulated shedding of the ADAM17 substrates CD62-L and TGFα is not affected. Moreover, we show that influx of extracellular calcium activates ADAM10 but is not essential for its activation by APMA and BzATP. Finally, the rapid stimulation of ADAM10 is not significantly affected by incubation with proprotein convertase inhibitors for up to 8 h, arguing against a major role of increased prodomain removal in the rapid stimulation of ADAM10. Thus, the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM10 negatively influences constitutive shedding through an ER retention motif, whereas the cytoplasmic domain and prodomain processing are not required for the rapid activation of ADAM10-dependent shedding events."
https://openalex.org/W2003456502,"Gene co-expression networks comprise one type of valuable biological networks. Many methods and tools have been published to construct gene co-expression networks; however, most of these tools and methods are inconvenient and time consuming for large datasets. We have developed a user-friendly, accelerated and optimized tool for constructing gene co-expression networks that can fully harness the parallel nature of GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) architectures. Genetic entropies were exploited to filter out genes with no or small expression changes in the raw data preprocessing step. Pearson correlation coefficients were then calculated. After that, we normalized these coefficients and employed the False Discovery Rate to control the multiple tests. At last, modules identification was conducted to construct the co-expression networks. All of these calculations were implemented on a GPU. We also compressed the coefficient matrix to save space. We compared the performance of the GPU implementation with those of multi-core CPU implementations with 16 CPU threads, single-thread C/C++ implementation and single-thread R implementation. Our results show that GPU implementation largely outperforms single-thread C/C++ implementation and single-thread R implementation, and GPU implementation outperforms multi-core CPU implementation when the number of genes increases. With the test dataset containing 16,000 genes and 590 individuals, we can achieve greater than 63 times the speed using a GPU implementation compared with a single-thread R implementation when 50 percent of genes were filtered out and about 80 times the speed when no genes were filtered out."
https://openalex.org/W2059216312,"The Transforming Growth Factor-ß (TGFß) family ligand Nodal is an essential embryonic morphogen that is associated with progression of breast and other cancers. It has therefore been suggested that Nodal inhibitors could be used to treat breast cancers where Nodal plays a defined role. As secreted antagonists, such as Cerberus, tightly regulate Nodal signaling during embryonic development, we undertook to produce human Cerberus, characterize its biochemical activities, and determine its effect on human breast cancer cells. Using quantitative methods, we investigated the mechanism of Nodal signaling, we evaluated binding of human Cerberus to Nodal and other TGFß family ligands, and we characterized the mechanism of Nodal inhibition by Cerberus. Using cancer cell assays, we examined the ability of Cerberus to suppress aggressive breast cancer cell phenotypes. We found that human Cerberus binds Nodal with high affinity and specificity, blocks binding of Nodal to its signaling partners, and inhibits Nodal signaling. Moreover, we showed that Cerberus profoundly suppresses migration, invasion, and colony forming ability of Nodal expressing and Nodal supplemented breast cancer cells. Taken together, our studies provide mechanistic insights into Nodal signaling and Nodal inhibition with Cerberus and highlight the potential value of Cerberus as anti-Nodal therapeutic."
https://openalex.org/W2044770614,"Objective In two studies, we aimed at further elucidating the relationship between trait negative affectivity (NA) and habitual symptom reporting (HSR) by relating these variables to measures of executive function, trait questionnaires, and effects of emotion induction. Methods Healthy female participants (N = 75) were selected on their scores for trait NA and for the Checklist for Symptoms in Daily Life. Three groups were compared: (1) low NA-low HSR; (2) high NA-low HSR; and (3) high NA-high HSR (low NA-high HSR did not occur). In study 1, participants underwent a Parametric Go/No-go Task and a Stroop Color-Word test, and trait questionnaires measured alexithymia and absorption. Forty-five participants (N = 15 in each group) were further engaged in study 2 to induce state NA using an affective picture paradigm. Results Impaired inhibition on the Stroop and Go/No go Task characterized high trait NA, but not high HSR, whereas alexithymia and absorption were elevated in HSR, regardless of trait NA. Negative picture viewing induced elevated state NA in all groups, but only high HSR also reported more bodily symptoms. This effect was moderated, but not mediated by state NA. Conclusion High trait NA is a vulnerability factor but not a sufficient condition to develop HSR. Deficient inhibition is related to the broad trait of NA, whereas the moderating effect of state NA on symptom reporting is specific for high HSR. Understanding processes related to alexithymia and absorption may specifically help to explain elevated HSR."
https://openalex.org/W2092299004,"The condensin complex plays a key role in organizing mitotic chromosomes. In vertebrates, there are two condensin complexes that have independent and cooperative roles in folding mitotic chromosomes. In this study, we dissect the role of a putative Cdk1 site on the condensin II subunit CAP-D3 in chicken DT40 cells. This conserved site has been shown to activate condensin II during prophase in human cells, and facilitate further phosphorylation by polo-like kinase I. We examined the functional significance of this phosphorylation mark by mutating the orthologous site of CAP-D3 (CAP-D3T1403A) in chicken DT40 cells. We show that this mutation is a gain of function mutant in chicken cells; it disrupts prophase, results in a dramatic shortening of the mitotic chromosome axis, and leads to abnormal INCENP localization. Our results imply phosphorylation of CAP-D3 acts to limit condensin II binding onto mitotic chromosomes. We present the first in vivo example that alters the ratio of condensin I:II on mitotic chromosomes. Our results demonstrate this ratio is a critical determinant in shaping mitotic chromosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2019592053,"Undifferentiated stem cells are better donor cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), resulting in more offspring than more differentiated cells. While various stem cell populations have been confirmed to exist in the skin, progress has been restricted due to the lack of a suitable marker for their prospective isolation. To address this fundamental issue, a marker is required that could unambiguously prove the differentiation state of the donor cells. We therefore utilized magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) to separate a homogeneous population of small SSEA-4+ cells from a heterogeneous population of bovine embryonic skin fibroblasts (BEF). SSEA-4+ cells were 8-10 μm in diameter and positive for alkaline phosphatase (AP). The percentage of SSEA-4+ cells within the cultured BEF population was low (2-3%). Immunocytochemistry and PCR analyses revealed that SSEA-4+ cells expressed pluripotency-related markers, and could differentiate into cells comprising all three germ layers in vitro. They remained undifferentiated over 20 passages in suspension culture. In addition, cloned embryos derived from SSEA-4 cells showed significant differences in cleavage rate and blastocyst development when compared with those from BEF and SSEA-4− cells. Moreover, blastocysts derived from SSEA-4+ cells showed a higher total cell number and lower apoptotic index as compared to BEF and SSEA-4– derived cells. It is well known that nuclei from pluripotent stem cells yield a higher cloning efficiency than those from adult somatic cells, however, pluripotent stem cells are relatively difficult to obtain from bovine. The SSEA-4+ cells described in the current study provide an attractive candidate for SCNT and a promising platform for the generation of transgenic cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2331735852,"G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling mediates many cellular functions, including cell survival, proliferation, and cell motility. Many of these processes are mediated by GPCR-promoted activation of Akt signaling by mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) pathway. However, the molecular mechanisms by which GPCRs govern Akt activation by these kinases remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway mediates Akt signaling promoted by the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Pharmacological inhibition of heterotrimeric G protein Gαi or PI3K signaling and siRNA targeting ESCRTs blocks CXCR4-promoted degradation of DEPTOR, an endogenous antagonist of mTORC2 activity. Depletion of ESCRTs by siRNA leads to increased levels of DEPTOR and attenuated CXCR4-promoted Akt activation and signaling, consistent with decreased mTORC2 activity. In addition, ESCRTs likely have a broad role in Akt signaling because ESCRT depletion also attenuates receptor tyrosine kinase-promoted Akt activation and signaling. Our data reveal a novel role for the ESCRT pathway in promoting intracellular signaling, which may begin to identify the signal transduction pathways that are important in the physiological roles of ESCRTs and Akt.

Benovic J.L. Regulation of CXCR4 signaling.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Typical of GPCRs, activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12 promotes release of GDP from the Gα subunit and binding to GTP, which in turn leads to the release of the Gβγ heterodimer. The GTP-bound Gαi and the released Gβγ activate various effector molecules and signaling pathways (7Busillo J.M. Benovic J.L. Regulation of CXCR4 signaling.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Two notable signaling pathways activated by CXCR4 are the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1 and -2 (ERK-1/2), signaling pathways. Akt and ERK-1/2 signaling play important roles in CXCR4-promoted cell survival and migration (7Busillo J.M. Benovic J.L. Regulation of CXCR4 signaling.Biochim. Biophys.

Akt is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the AGC family of protein kinases (9Pearce L.R. Komander D. Alessi D.R. The nuts and bolts of AGC protein kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar).

Despite the importance of Akt signaling in health and disease, the mechanisms governing its activation by signaling receptors remain poorly understood. GPCR-promoted Akt activation is typically mediated by the Gβγ heterodimer, which binds directly to PI3Kβ (10Dbouk H.A. Vadas O. Shymanets A. Burke J.E. Salamon R.S. Khalil B.D. Barrett M.O.

This interaction is generally considered to be confined to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane where PI3K catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (13Hirsch E.

PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 serves as a docking site for the pleckstrin homology domains of PDK1 (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent protein kinase) and Akt, leading to their plasma membrane recruitment and PDK1 phosphorylation of Akt at threonine residue 308 (Thr-308 of Akt1). Akt is also phosphorylated by mTORC2 (mechanistic or mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2) at serine residue 473 (Ser-473 of Akt1) (14Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Phosphorylation and regulation of Akt/PKB by the rictor-mTOR complex.Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). How GPCR signaling leads to activation of mTORC2 remains virtually unknown. mTORC2 is a multiprotein complex consisting of mTOR, Rictor, mSin1, mLst8, and DEPTOR plus other recently defined subunits (15Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar). mTOR, mLst8, and DEPTOR are also found in a distinct multisubunit kinase complex referred to as mTORC1, which also consists of Raptor and PRAS40 (15Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar). DEPTOR (DEP-domain containing mTOR-interacting protein) negatively regulates the activity of mTORC2 and mTORC1 (15Laplante M. Sabatini D.M. mTOR signaling in growth control and disease.Cell. 2012; 149: 274-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar). DEP (Dishevelled, EGL-10, pleckstrin) domains have been linked to regulation of GPCR signaling (16Ballon D.R. Flanary P.L. Gladue D.P. Konopka J.B. Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. DEP-domain-mediated regulation of GPCR signaling responses.Cell. 2006; 126: 1079-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). DEPTOR interacts with mTOR and inhibits mTOR kinase activity, thereby serving as an endogenous inhibitor of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 (17Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C. Sancak Y. Kang S.A.

DEPTOR regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 is critical, as perturbations in this regulation have been linked to aberrant Akt signaling in several cancers (17Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Thoreen C.C.

Despite this, the molecular mechanisms that regulate DEPTOR in cells remain poorly understood. In addition to the proteasome, the lysosome is the major degradative compartment in cells (22Ciechanover A. Intracellular protein degradation: from a vague idea through the lysosome and the ubiquitin-proteasome system and onto human diseases and drug targeting.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2013; 21: 3400-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Targeting proteins for lysosomal degradation can occur via multiple mechanisms, including the ESCRT pathway (23Luzio J.P. Parkinson M.D. Gray S.R. Bright N.A. The delivery of endocytosed cargo to lysosomes.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 1019-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The ESCRT pathway consists of four distinct protein complexes (ESCRT-0-III) plus the disassembly VPS4 complex (24Henne W.M. Stenmark H. Emr S.D.

Cell. 2011; 21: 77-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). These complexes act in a coordinated manner on the limiting membrane of endosomes to promote the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) leading to the creation of the multivesicular body (MVB) (26Hurley J.H. Hanson P.I. Membrane budding and scission by the ESCRT machinery: it's all in the neck.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 556-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Mature MVBs then fuse with lysosomes where their contents are degraded (27Gruenberg J. Stenmark H. The biogenesis of multivesicular endosomes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). ESCRTs also target ubiquitinated transmembrane cargo into ILVs by virtue of their ability to interact with ubiquitin moieties on the cargo via the ubiquitin binding domains present in several ESCRT subunits (28Raiborg C.

Role of ubiquitination in endocytic trafficking of G-protein-coupled receptors.Traffic. 2011; 12: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As such, the ESCRT pathway typically mediates down-regulation of receptor signaling (33Rodahl L.M. Stuffers S. Lobert V.H. Stenmark H. The role of ESCRT proteins in attenuation of cell signalling.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but recently this pathway has also been linked to positive regulation of cell signaling (34Taelman V.F. Dobrowolski R.

For example, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), which serves as an endogenous antagonist of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, is targeted into ILVs by ESCRTs. GSK-3β is normally active and free in the cytoplasm to phosphorylate β-catenin, thereby promoting its proteasomal degradation (34Taelman V.F. Dobrowolski R. Plouhinec J.L. Fuentealba L.C.

To our knowledge, whether DEPTOR is sequestered in MVBs and/or degraded by lysosomes remains unknown. Here, we show that activation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and α2-adrenergic receptors, prototypical GPCRs, promotes degradation of DEPTOR. We show that GPCR-promoted DEPTOR degradation is blocked by lysomotrophic agents and by siRNA directed against ESCRTs. ESCRT depletion leads to increased levels of DEPTOR and attenuation of Akt activation by mTORC2. ESCRT depletion also attenuates receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-promoted Akt activation and signaling. Our findings indicate that ESCRTs regulate receptor-promoted DEPTOR degradation and Akt signaling. HeLa cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

For DEPTOR degradation, HeLa cells (300,000) were passaged onto a 6-well plate. The following day, cells were washed with DMEM containing 20 mm HEPES and then serum-starved in the same media for 3 h. Cells were then incubated with the same media containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by treatment with vehicle (0.1% BSA in PBS) or 10 nm CXCL12 for various times. To examine the effect of inhibitors on CXCR4-promoted DEPTOR degradation, cells were washed with warm DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, then treated with the same media containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 15 min, followed by pretreatment with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 200 μm chloroquine, 10 μm lactacystin, 50 ng/ml pertussis toxin, 50 μm gallein, 50–100 nm wortmannin, and 0.5–5 mm 3-methyladenine for 1 h. Cells were then treated with vehicle or 10 nm CXCL12 for 3 h in the continued presence of the inhibitors. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and collected in 300 μl of 2× sample buffer (8% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, 37.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 0.003% bromphenol blue). Equal amounts of samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. DEPTOR degradation was determined by densitometric analysis of similar exposures of film across multiple experiments. HeLa and BAEC cells were transfected with siRNA (50 nm final concentration) directed against individual subunits of ESCRT-0 (STAM1), ESCRT-I (UBAP1 or Tsg101), ESCRT-II (Vps22), ESCRT-III (CHMP4C), or control siRNA (luciferase or GAPDH) siRNA.

Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C using a 5417r-Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The cleared supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).

https://openalex.org/W2018172401,"The transcriptional co-activator YAP (Yes-associated protein) functions as an oncogene; however, it is largely unclear how YAP exerts its oncogenic role. In this study, we further explored the functional significance of YAP and its mitotic phosphorylation in the spindle checkpoint. We found that the dynamic mitotic phosphorylation of YAP was CDC14-dependent. We also showed that YAP was required for the spindle checkpoint activation induced by spindle poisons. Mitotic phosphorylation of YAP was required for activation of the spindle checkpoint. Furthermore, enhanced expression of active YAP hyperactivated the spindle checkpoint and induced mitotic defects in a mitotic phosphorylation-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we documented that mitotic phosphorylation of YAP controlled transcription of genes associated with the spindle checkpoint. YAP constitutively associated with BubR1 (BUB1-related protein kinase), and knockdown of BubR1 relieved YAP-driven hyperactivation of the spindle checkpoint. Finally, we demonstrated that YAP promoted epithelial cell invasion via both mitotic phosphorylation and BubR1-dependent mechanisms. Together, our results reveal a novel link between YAP and the spindle checkpoint and indicate a potential mechanism underlying the oncogenic function of YAP through dysregulation of the spindle checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W2038647219,"The α1A-AR is thought to couple predominantly to the Gαq/PLC pathway and lead to phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium mobilization, although certain agonists acting at this receptor have been reported to trigger activation of arachidonic acid formation and MAPK pathways. For several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) agonists can manifest a bias for activation of particular effector signaling output, i.e. not all agonists of a given GPCR generate responses through utilization of the same signaling cascade(s). Previous work with Gαq coupling-defective variants of α1A-AR, as well as a combination of Ca2+ channel blockers, uncovered cross-talk between α1A-AR and β2-AR that leads to potentiation of a Gαq-independent signaling cascade in response to α1A-AR activation. We hypothesized that molecules exist that act as biased agonists to selectively activate this pathway. In this report, isoproterenol (Iso), typically viewed as β-AR-selective agonist, was examined with respect to activation of α1A-AR. α1A-AR selective antagonists were used to specifically block Iso evoked signaling in different cellular backgrounds and confirm its action at α1A-AR. Iso induced signaling at α1A-AR was further interrogated by probing steps along the Gαq /PLC, Gαs and MAPK/ERK pathways. In HEK-293/EBNA cells transiently transduced with α1A-AR, and CHO_α1A-AR stable cells, Iso evoked low potency ERK activity as well as Ca2+ mobilization that could be blocked by α1A-AR selective antagonists. The kinetics of Iso induced Ca2+ transients differed from typical Gαq- mediated Ca2+ mobilization, lacking both the fast IP3R mediated response and the sustained phase of Ca2+ re-entry. Moreover, no inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation could be detected in either cell line after stimulation with Iso, but activation was accompanied by receptor internalization. Data are presented that indicate that Iso represents a novel type of α1A-AR partial agonist with signaling bias toward MAPK/ERK signaling cascade that is likely independent of coupling to Gαq."

The aim of this animal study was to elucidate the influence of early immune stimulation triggered by systemic postnatal lipopolysaccharide administration on biochemical, histopathological and morphological measures, which may be relevant to the neurobiology of human psychopathology. In the present study of adult male Wistar rats we examined the brain and plasma levels of monoamines (dopamine, serotonin), their metabolites, the levels of the main excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid and the levels of tryptophan and its metabolites from the kynurenine catabolic pathway. Further, we focused on histopathological and morphological markers related to pathogenesis of brain diseases - glial cell activation, neurodegeneration, hippocampal volume reduction and dopaminergic synthesis in the substantia nigra. Our results show that early immune stimulation in adult animals alters the levels of neurotransmitters and their metabolites, activates the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism and leads to astrogliosis, hippocampal volume reduction and a decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra. These findings support the crucial pathophysiological role of early immune stimulation in the above mentioned neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2079595049,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to detect the alterations of spontaneous neuronal activity in various neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, but rarely in hemifacial spasm (HFS), a nervous system disorder. We used resting-state fMRI with regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis to investigate changes in spontaneous brain activity of patients with HFS and to determine the relationship of these functional changes with clinical features. Thirty patients with HFS and 33 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls were included in this study. Compared with controls, HFS patients had significantly decreased ReHo values in left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), left medial cingulate cortex (MCC), left lingual gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right precuneus; and increased ReHo values in left precentral gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right brainstem, and right cerebellum. Furthermore, the mean ReHo value in brainstem showed a positive correlation with the spasm severity (r = 0.404, p = 0.027), and the mean ReHo value in MFG was inversely related with spasm severity in HFS group (r = -0.398, p = 0.028). This study reveals that HFS is associated with abnormal spontaneous brain activity in brain regions most involved in motor control and blinking movement. The disturbances of spontaneous brain activity reflected by ReHo measurements may provide insights into the neurological pathophysiology of HFS."

But how this enzyme is retained in the Golgi is not known. Proteomics analysis identifies keratin type II cytoskeletal 1 (KRT1) as a protein pulled down with anti-c-Myc antibody or C2GnT-M CT from the lysate of Panc1 cells expressing bC2GnT-M tagged with c-Myc. Yeast two-hybrid analysis shows that the rod domain of KRT1 interacts directly with the WKR6 motif in the C2GnT-M CT.

https://openalex.org/W2049097126,"The effects of lipids on membrane proteins are likely to be complex and unique for each membrane protein. Here we studied different detergent/phosphatidylcholine reconstitution media and tested their effects on plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA). We found that Ca2+-ATPase activity shows a biphasic behavior with respect to the detergent/phosphatidylcholine ratio. Moreover, the maximal Ca2+-ATPase activity largely depends on the length and the unsaturation degree of the hydrocarbon chain. Using static light scattering and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we monitored the changes in hydrodynamic radius of detergent/phosphatidylcholine particles during the micelle-vesicle transition. We found that, when PMCA is reconstituted in mixed micelles, neutral phospholipids increase the enzyme turnover. The biophysical changes associated with the transition from mixed micelles to bicelles increase the time of residence of the phosphorylated intermediate (EP), decreasing the enzyme turnover. Molecular dynamics simulations analysis of the interactions between PMCA and the phospholipid bilayer in which it is embedded show that in the 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer, charged residues of the protein are trapped in the hydrophobic core. Conversely, in the 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer, the overall hydrophobic-hydrophilic requirements of the protein surface are fulfilled the best, reducing the thermodynamic cost of exposing charged residues to the hydrophobic core. The apparent mismatch produced by a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine thicker bilayer could be a structural foundation to explain its functional effect on PMCA."
https://openalex.org/W2004332082,"Ewing Sarcoma is an aggressive malignancy of bone and soft tissue affecting children and young adults. Ewing Sarcoma is driven by EWS/Ets fusion oncoproteins, which cause widespread alterations in gene expression in the cell. Dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, particularly involving IGF-1R, also plays an important role in Ewing Sarcoma pathogenesis. However, the basis of this dysregulation, including the relative contribution of EWS/Ets-dependent and independent mechanisms, is not well understood. In the present study, we identify variable expression of two modifiers of PI3K signaling activity, PIK3R3 and PTEN, in Ewing Sarcoma, and examine the consequences of this on PI3K pathway regulation and oncogenic phenotypes. Our findings indicate that PIK3R3 plays a growth-promotional role in Ewing Sarcoma, but suggest that this role is not strictly dependent on regulation of PI3K pathway activity. We further show that expression of PTEN, a well-established, potent tumor suppressor, is lost in a subset of Ewing Sarcomas, and that this loss strongly correlates with high baseline PI3K pathway activity in cell lines. In support of functional importance of PTEN loss in Ewing Sarcoma, we show that re-introduction of PTEN into two different PTEN-negative Ewing Sarcoma cell lines results in downregulation of PI3K pathway activity, and sensitization to the IGF-1R small molecule inhibitor OSI-906. Our findings also suggest that PTEN levels may contribute to sensitivity of Ewing Sarcoma cells to the microtubule inhibitor vincristine, a relevant chemotherapeutic agent in this cancer. Our studies thus identify PIK3R3 and PTEN as modifiers of oncogenic phenotypes in Ewing Sarcoma, with potential clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2054130241,"Glycosaminoglycans in mammalian extracellular matrices are degraded to their constituents, unsaturated uronic (glucuronic/iduronic) acids and amino sugars, through successive reactions of bacterial polysaccharide lyase and unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase. Genes coding for glycosaminoglycan-acting lyase, unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase, and the phosphotransferase system are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pathogenic bacteria, such as streptococci and clostridia. Here, we studied the streptococcal metabolic pathway of unsaturated uronic acids and the structure/function relationship of its relevant isomerase and dehydrogenase. Two proteins (gbs1892 and gbs1891) of Streptococcus agalactiae strain NEM316 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. 4-Deoxy-l-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate (Dhu) nonenzymatically generated from unsaturated uronic acids was converted to 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-gluconate via 3-deoxy-d-glycero-2,5-hexodiulosonate through successive reactions of gbs1892 isomerase (DhuI) and gbs1891 NADH-dependent reductase/dehydrogenase (DhuD). DhuI and DhuD enzymatically corresponded to 4-deoxy-l-threo-5-hexosulose-uronate ketol-isomerase (KduI) and 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-gluconate dehydrogenase (KduD), respectively, involved in pectin metabolism, although no or low sequence identity was observed between DhuI and KduI or between DhuD and KduD, respectively. Genes for DhuI and DhuD were found to be included in the streptococcal genetic cluster, whereas KduI and KduD are encoded in clostridia. Tertiary and quaternary structures of DhuI and DhuD were determined by x-ray crystallography. Distinct from KduI β-barrels, DhuI adopts an α/β/α-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to that of ribose 5-phosphate isomerase. The structure of DhuD is unable to accommodate the substrate/cofactor, suggesting that conformational changes are essential to trigger enzyme catalysis. This is the first report on the bacterial metabolism of glycosaminoglycan-derived unsaturated uronic acids by isomerase and dehydrogenase."
https://openalex.org/W2012085384,"We reported previously that an N-acylthiourea derivative (TM-2-51) serves as a potent and isozyme-selective activator for human histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8). To probe the molecular mechanism of the enzyme activation, we performed a detailed account of the steady-state kinetics, thermodynamics, molecular modeling, and cell biology studies. The steady-state kinetic data revealed that TM-2-51 binds to HDAC8 at two sites in a positive cooperative manner. Isothermal titration calorimetric and molecular modeling data conformed to the two-site binding model of the enzyme-activator complex. We evaluated the efficacy of TM-2-51 on SH-SY5Y and BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cells, wherein the HDAC8 expression has been correlated with cellular malignancy. Whereas TM-2-51 selectively induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, it showed no such effects in BE(2)-C cells, and this discriminatory feature appears to be encoded in the p53 genotype of the above cells. Our mechanistic and cellular studies on HDAC8 activation have the potential to provide insight into the development of novel anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2052947726,"Cytotoxic T cells (Tc) use perforin and granzyme B (gzmB) to kill virus-infected cells and cancer cells. Recent evidence suggests that human gzmB primarily induces apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway by either cleaving Bid or activating Bim leading to the activation of Bak/Bax and subsequent generation of active caspase-3. In contrast, mouse gzmB is thought to predominantly induce apoptosis by directly processing pro-caspase-3. However, in certain mouse cell types gzmB-mediated apoptosis mainly occurs via the mitochondrial pathway. To investigate whether Bim is involved under the latter conditions, we have now employed ex vivo virus-immune mouse Tc that selectively kill by using perforin and gzmB (gzmB+Tc) as effector cells and wild type as well as Bim- or Bak/Bax-deficient spontaneously (3T9) or virus-(SV40) transformed mouse embryonic fibroblast cells as targets. We show that gzmB+Tc-mediated apoptosis (phosphatidylserine translocation, mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation) was severely reduced in 3T9 cells lacking either Bim or both Bak and Bax. This outcome was related to the ability of Tc cells to induce the degradation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL, the anti-apoptotic counterparts of Bim. In contrast, gzmB+Tc-mediated apoptosis was not affected in SV40-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblast cells lacking Bak/Bax. The data provide evidence that Bim participates in mouse gzmB+Tc-mediated apoptosis of certain targets by activating the mitochondrial pathway and suggest that the mode of cell death depends on the target cell.

The parallel characteristic of quantum computing is used in QPPSO. This characteristic increases the calculation of each generation exponentially. The behavior of particles in quantum space is restrained by the quantum evolution equation, which consists of the current rotation angle, individual optimal quantum rotation angle, and global optimal quantum rotation angle. Numerical simulation based on several typical fractional-order systems and comparisons with some typical existing algorithms show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm."
https://openalex.org/W2096231007,"A recent study has inferred that the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is now widespread in Tasmania as of 2010, based on the extraction of fox DNA from predator scats. Heuristically, this inference appears at first glance to be at odds with the lack of recent confirmed discoveries of either road-killed foxes--the last of which occurred in 2006, or hunter killed foxes--the most recent in 2001. This paper demonstrates a method to codify this heuristic analysis and produce inferences consistent with assumptions and data. It does this by formalising the analysis in a transparent and repeatable manner to make inference on the past, present and future distribution of an invasive species. It utilizes Approximate Bayesian Computation to make inferences. Importantly, the method is able to inform management of invasive species within realistic time frames, and can be applied widely. We illustrate the technique using the Tasmanian fox data. Based on the pattern of carcass discoveries of foxes in Tasmania, we infer that the population of foxes in Tasmania is most likely extinct, or restricted in distribution and demographically weak as of 2013. It is possible, though unlikely, that that population is widespread and/or demographically robust. This inference is largely at odds with the inference from the predator scat survey data. Our results suggest the chances of successfully eradicating the introduced red fox population in Tasmania may be significantly higher than previously thought."

The effect of intranasal administration of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), an epithelial mitogen and differentiation factor, on M. tuberculosis infection in mice was tested in prophylaxis, treatment, and rescue scenarios. Infection of C57BL6 mice with M. tuberculosis resulted in inoculum size-dependent weight loss and mortality. A single dose of KGF given 1 day prior to infection with 105 M. tuberculosis bacilli prevented weight loss and enhanced pulmonary mycobacterial clearance (compared with saline-pretreated mice) for up to 28 days. Similar effects were seen when KGF was delivered intranasally every third day for 15 days, but weight loss and bacillary growth resumed when KGF was withdrawn. For mice with a well established M. tuberculosis infection, KGF given every 3 days beginning on day 15 postinoculation was associated with reversal of weight loss and an increase in M. tuberculosis clearance. In in vitro co-culture experiments, M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages exposed to conditioned medium from KGF-treated alveolar type II cell (MLE-15) monolayers exhibited enhanced GM-CSF-dependent killing through mechanisms that included promotion of phagolysosome fusion and induction of nitric oxide. Alveolar macrophages from KGF-treated mice also exhibited enhanced GM-CSF-dependent phagolysosomal fusion. These results provide evidence that administration of KGF promotes M. tuberculosis clearance through GM-CSF-dependent mechanisms and enhances host defense against M. tuberculosis infection.

ACTH is a polypeptide hormone produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. ACTH stimulates secretion of glucocorticoid steroid hormones from adrenal cortex cells, especially in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland in response to biological stress. The ACTH receptor, also known as the melanocortin-2 receptor (MC2R), 2The abbreviations used are: MC2Rmelanocortin-2 receptorhMC2Rhuman MC2RGPCRG protein-coupled receptorMCRmelanocortin receptorMSHmelanocyte-stimulating hormoned-Nald-naphthylalanineTM3transmembrane domain 3. is critical for ACTH-mediated adrenal glucocorticoid release. ACTH binds to its receptor, mainly expressed on adrenocortical cells of the adrenal cortex, and stimulates the production of cortisol. Deficiency of the human MC2R (hMC2R) have been identified to result in a potentially fatal disease called familial glucocorticoid deficiency (1.Clark A.J. Weber A.

Patients with MC2R mutation have high levels of serum ACTH and low levels of cortisol. Individuals with familial glucocorticoid deficiency are deficient in cortisol, subsequently resulting in childhood failure to thrive, weakness, and fatigue. These individuals are likely to die in adrenal crisis, such as hypoglycemia or overwhelming infection, in infancy or childhood if they are not treated (1.Clark A.J. Weber A.

Deficiency of MC2R caused by MC2R mutation is also associated with a number of pathologic conditions, such as Addison disease and Cushing syndrome. MC2R is therefore a potential therapeutic target for adrenal disorders. ACTH(1–39) was first synthesized as a replacement for Acthar gel. It is used to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis, infantile spasms, and nephrotic syndrome (a collection of symptoms that indicate kidney damage). Acthar gel is a Food and Drug Administration-approved option for dermatomyositis (a chronic inflammatory disease of skin and muscle associated with patches of raised reddish or scaly rash) and polymyositis (an autoimmune inflammatory disease of muscle). Another active synthetic form of ACTH consists of the first 24 amino acids of native ACTH. ACTH is available as a synthetic derivative in the forms of cosyntropin (trade name Cortrosyn) and Synacthen (synthetic ACTH). Synacthen is not Food and Drug Administration-approved, but it is used in the United Kingdom and Australia to conduct the ACTH stimulation test. Elucidating the molecular basis of MC2R responsible for ligand binding and signaling is therefore a prerequisite to the development of selective MC2R agonists and antagonists for the treatment of adrenal disorders. melanocortin-2 receptor human MC2R G protein-coupled receptor melanocortin receptor melanocyte-stimulating hormone d-naphthylalanine transmembrane domain 3. MC2R is one of five known melanocortin receptors (MCRs) belonging to the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (15.Mountjoy K.G. Robbins L.S. Mortrud M.T. Cone R.D. The cloning of a family of genes that encode the melanocortin receptors.Science. 1992; 257: 1248-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). It shares a nearly 40% homology with other melanocortin receptor subtypes, but it is unique among MCRs for its ligand selectivity. The melanocortin peptides α-, β-, and γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and ACTH are a group of neuropeptides that are derived from the proopiomelanocortin prohormone and that contain a common amino acid sequence, His-Phe-Arg-Trp. ACTH is the only endogenous ligand for MC2R. A large number of MSH analogs have been characterized as MCR subtypes (16.Sawyer T.K. Sanfilippo P.J. Hruby V.J. Engel M.H. Heward C.B. Burnett J.B.

Moreover, substitution of Phe7 in MSH with d-naphthylalanine (d-Nal(2′)) switches MSH from agonist to antagonist at MC3R and MC4R (21.Yang Y. Chen M. Lai Y. Gantz I. Georgeson K.E. Harmon C.M.

All of these studies indicate that Phe7 in melanocortin peptides plays an important role in ligand binding and potency at MCRs. However, ACTH is an endogenous agonist only for MC2R, and ACTH shares the first 13 amino acid residues with α-MSH. Whether Phe7 in ACTH also plays an important role in ligand binding affinity and potency at MC2R remains unknown. In this study, we examined the role of Phe7 in ACTH responsible for ligand selectivity and potency at hMC2R using ACTH analogs and determined the molecular basis of MC2R for ligand selectivity and potency using receptor mutagenesis and receptor modeling. Our results suggest that the role of Phe7 in ACTH is different at MC2R compared with other MCRs in ligand selectivity and that the third transmembrane domain (TM3) of MC2R is crucial for this differentiation. ACTH(1–24) and the ACTH analogs were custom-prepared by GenScript USA Inc. (Belmont, CA) (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequences of hMC2R and hMC4R were manually examined by comparing their sequences with a previously published alignment of seven-transmembrane GPCR α-helices (22.Baldwin J.M. The probable arrangement of the helices in G protein-coupled receptors.EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The chimeras utilized in this study are schematically diagramed in Fig. 2. The chimeric receptors were constructed by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (23.Yang Y. Dickinson C.J. Zeng Q. Li J.Y. Thompson D.A. Gantz I. Contribution of melanocortin receptor exoloops to Agouti-related protein binding.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14100-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). hMC4R served as a template. During an initial round of PCR, partial-length receptor fragments were generated. The sequence of one of the PCR primer oligonucleotides consisted of the transmembrane domain of interest, which was then coupled to a portion of the extracellular domain required to form the chimeric receptor. The second oligonucleotide primer consisted of the 5′- or 3′-end of MC4R. Receptor fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and used in a second round of PCR in which full-length chimeric receptor constructs were assembled by cycling the appropriate fragments together for 10 cycles prior to adding both 5′- and 3′-receptor primers. The chimeric receptors were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). A single mutation was constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The entire coding region of the MC2R mutants was sequenced at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Sequence Core to confirm that the desired mutation sequences were present and that no sequence errors had been introduced. The OS3 and HEK cell lines, lacking endogenous MC2R, were used for hMC4R, hMC2R, and chimeric receptor transfection. The cells transfected with the receptor were cultured in DMEM containing 10% bovine fetal serum and HEPES. Cells at 80% confluence were washed twice, and the receptor constructs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies). The permanently transfected clonal cell lines were selected by resistance to the neomycin analog G418 (24.Yang Y. Dickinson C. Haskell-Luevano C. Gantz I. Molecular basis for the interaction of [Nle4,d-Phe7]melanocyte stimulating hormone with the human melanocortin-1 receptor (melanocyte α-MSH receptor).J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23000-23010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Binding experiments were performed using the conditions described previously (25.Yang Y. Fong T.M. Dickinson C.J. Mao C. Li J.Y. Tota M.R. Mosley R. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Gantz I. Molecular determinants of ligand binding to the human melanocortin-4 receptor.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14900-14911Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, after removal of the medium, cells were incubated with non-radioligand ACTH from 10−10 to 10−6 m in 0.5 ml of minimum Eagle's medium containing 0.2% BSA and 2 × 105 cpm of 125I-ACTH(1–24) for 1 h. The binding reactions were terminated by removing the medium and washing the cells twice with minimum Eagle's medium containing 0.2% BSA. The cells were then lysed with 0.2 n NaOH, and the radioactivity in the lysate was quantified in an analytical γ-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring the amount of 125I label bound on the cells in the presence of excess 10−6 m unlabeled ligand. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecifically bound radioactivity from total bound radioactivity. Binding data are reported as Bmax and IC50. Cellular cAMP generation was measured using a cAMP assay kit (BioTek). Cells were plated on 96-well plates overnight. The culture medium was removed briefly, and the cells were incubated with 50 μl of Earle's balanced salt solution containing the melanocortin agonist ACTH (10−10 to 10−6 m) for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10−3 m isobutylmethylxanthine. The reaction was stopped by the addition of lysis buffer (50 μl/well) and incubation for 20 min. cAMP content was measured according to the instructions accompanying the assay kit. The transfected cells were harvested in 0.2% EDTA and washed twice with PBS. Aliquots of 3 × 106 cells were centrifuged and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). The cells were incubated with 50 μl of 10 μg/ml murine anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M1 (Sigma catalog no. 316) in incubation buffer for 45 min. Under these conditions, the primary antibody binds only to receptors located at the cell surface. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with incubation buffer. The cell pellets were suspended in 100 μl of incubation buffer containing Cy3-conjugated Affinity Pure donkey anti-mouse IgG (ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD FACStarPLUS 6-parameter cytometer/sorter with a dual-argon ion laser (BD Biosciences). The results were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Each experiment was performed in duplicate three separate times. The mean value of the dose-response data of binding and cAMP production was fit to a sigmoid curve with a variable slope factor using nonlinear square regression analysis (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Significant differences were assessed by Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Extensive studies have identified that Phe7 in MSH plays an important role in ligand binding and receptor signaling at MC1R, MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R. To test whether Phe7 in ACTH also plays an important role in ligand binding affinity and signaling at MC2R, we examined several ACTH analogs in which Phe7 was modified. First, hMC2R was transfected into OS3 cells, which lack endogenous MC2R, and the receptor function was examined. Cells expressing hMC2R were incubated with 125I-ACTH(1–24) and different concentrations of unlabeled ACTH analogs. Ligand binding affinity was determined. Our results indicate that ACTH(1–24) dose-dependently displaced 125I-ACTH binding at WT hMC2R. Consistent with the binding results, ACTH(1–24) was able to stimulate cAMP production at WT hMC2R in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). The IC50 and EC50 are shown in Table 1. Second, we examined several ACTH analogs at hMC2R. Our results indicate that substitution of Phe7 with d-Phe in ACTH(1–24) ([d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24)) dose-dependently displaced 125I-ACTH binding at hMC2R, but the binding affinity was significantly decreased compared with that of Phe7-ACTH(1–24). Consistent with the binding results, [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) was able to stimulate cAMP production at hMC2R in a dose-dependent manner, but its potency was significantly reduced (Fig. 3). The IC50 and EC50 values are shown in Table 1. Previous results indicate that substitution of Phe7 with d-Nal(2′) in [Nle4,d-Phe7]α-MSH switches agonist to antagonist at MC3R and MC4R (21.Yang Y. Chen M. Lai Y. Gantz I. Georgeson K.E. Harmon C.M. Molecular determinants of human melanocortin-4 receptor responsible for antagonist SHU9119 selective activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, in this study, [d-Nal(2′)7]ACTH(1–24) (substitution of Phe7 with d-Nal(2′) in ACTH) dose-dependently displaced 125I-ACTH binding at hMC2R, but its binding affinity was significantly reduced. Surprisingly, [d-Nal(2′)7]ACTH(1–24) still dose dependently induced cAMP production at hMC2R, unlike [d-Nal(2′)7]MSH at MC3R and MC4R, for which SHU9119 is an antagonist (Fig. 3). SHU9119 is a synthetic peptide with a β-(2-naphthyl)-d-alanine (d-Nal) substituted at position 7 of MTII and is a potent but nonselective antagonist for MC3R and MC4R (19.Hruby V.J. Lu D. Sharma S.D.

Open table in a new tab Our previous results indicate that ACTH(1–17) is the minimal ACTH peptide for hMC2R binding and receptor activation. To further examine the role of ACTH Phe7 in receptor binding affinity and potency, we examined different ACTH(1–17) analogous at MC2R. We examined the effects of Phe7-ACTH(1–17), [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–17), and [d-Nal(2′)7]ACTH(1–17) on MC2R binding and signaling. Our results indicate that Phe7-ACTH(1–17) and [d-Nal(2′)7]ACTH(1–17) were able to bind to the receptor and stimulate cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner. However, [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–17) lost its ability to bind and activate the receptor (Fig. 4). The binding affinity IC50 and potency EC50 values are shown in Table 1. To determine whether [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–17) is functional, we examined this peptide's activity at hMC1R. Our results indicate that [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–17) dose-dependently displaced 125I-ACTH(1–24) binding and induced cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner at hMC1R, suggesting that this peptide is functional (data not shown). To determine which region of hMC2R is responsible for the difference in ACTH analog selectivity and potency, a domain-exchange strategy was used to localize regions of hMC2R responsible for ligand selectivity and potency. We first used MC2R as a template, and TM2–TM6 of MC2R were substituted with the homologous regions of hMC4R. To determine whether the chimeric receptors are expressed at the cell surface and to quantify receptor expression levels, we utilized the antigenic epitope FLAG to examine receptor expression. Our results indicate that these chimeric receptors were expressed on the cell surface at a very low level, and we were unable to assess ligand binding affinity and potency. We then utilized MC4R as a template, and TM2–TM6 of hMC4R were substituted with the homologous regions of hMC2R. To assess the binding affinity of peptide [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) at these chimeric receptors, cells expressing the chimeric receptors were treated with 125I-Phe7-ACTH(1–24) and different doses of unlabeled [d-Phe7]ACTH analogs (FIGURE 5., FIGURE 6.). Our results indicate that these chimeric receptors did not significantly alter [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) binding affinity, except the chimeric receptor hMC4R/TM3 hMC2R. Ligand [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) binding affinity at this chimeric receptor was significantly decreased. The IC50 values are summarized in Table 2. To examine the ability of [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) to activate chimeric hMC4R/hMC2R, cells expressing the chimeric receptors were treated with different doses of [d-Phe7]ACTH analogs, and cAMP production was examined. Our results indicate that [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) increased cAMP generation in a dose-dependent manner at these hMC4R/hMC2R chimeras, which are similar to WT MC4R, except for chimeric hMC4R/TM3 hMC2R. Substitution of hMC4R TM3 with hMC2R TM3 (hMC4R/TM3 hMC2R) significantly decreased [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) potency (FIGURE 5., FIGURE 6.). The EC50 values are shown in Table 2.FIGURE 6.Binding affinity and potency of ACTH at the chimeric receptors. HEK cells transfected hMC4R chimeras were incubated with 125I-ACTH at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of the indicated amounts of unlabeled ligands, and total 125I-ACTH binding was determined on duplicate wells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the cAMP assay, the cells transfected with hMC4R chimeras were incubated with the indicated amounts of [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) for 30 min, and total cAMP accumulation was determined on duplicate wells. Data points represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. A depicts the binding affinity of [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) at the chimeric receptors.

Open table in a new tab TM3 of hMC2R has been identified to play an important role in [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) binding affinity and potency. Amino acid sequence alignment between TM3 of hMC2R and TM3 of hMC4R was performed. Three amino acids were identified not to be conserved between TM3 of hMC4R and TM3 of hMC2R. We then performed a site-directed mutagenesis study to determine whether these amino acid residues are crucial for ligand binding affinity and potency. Three MC2R mutations were made (D104N, I105V, and L109V), and effect of [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) on these mutations was examined. Cells expressing these mutations were treated with [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24), and ligand binding affinity and potency were evaluated. Our results indicate that D104N, I105V, and L109V did not dramatically increase [Nle4,d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) agonist potency (EC50 for [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24)): WT MC2R, 39 ± 11 nm; D104N, 35 ± 8 nm; I105V, 37 ± 9 nm; and L109V, 41 ± 12 nm, suggesting that the conformation of TM3 is crucial for [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) agonist binding and potency. We also examined the effects of ligands ACTH(1–39), ACTH(1–24), and ACTH(1–17), as well as α-MSH, at chimeric MC4R/TM3 MC2R (Fig. 7). Our results further support that Phe7 in ACTH plays an important role in ligand selectivity and potency in the MCR subtype. For chimeric MC4R/TM3 MC2R, the ACTH ligand with d-Phe had high selectivity and potency, whereas the ACTH ligand with Phe had less potency, suggesting that the conformation of Phe in ACTH plays different roles in MC2R and MC4R. We have shown that substitution of Phe7 in ACTH with d-Phe or d-Nal(2′) resulted in decreased ligand binding affinity and potency. Substitution of Phe7 with d-Nal(2′) in ACTH did not switch the ligand from agonist to antagonist at MC2R, suggesting that MC2R, unlike other MCRs, has different binding sites for d-Phe and d-Nal(2′) in ACTH. The melanocortin peptides α-MSH and ACTH are derived from the proopiomelanocortin prohormone. α-MSH shares the first 13 amino acids with ACTH, and they share the core sequence His6-Phe7-Arg8-Trp9. This region was identified as important for ligand binding and activities at hMC1R, hMC2R, hMC3R, hMC4R, and hMC5R (27.Holder J.R. Bauzo R.M. Xiang Z. Haskell-Luevano C.

Our previous results also indicate that first 17 amino acid residues in ACTH are crucial for ligand binding and signaling at MC2R. ACTH analogs of fewer than 17 residues resulted in loss of ligand binding affinity and potency at MC2R. A d-Phe7 substitution in α-MSH ([Nle4,d-Phe7]α-MSH) increased ligand binding affinity and potency at MC1R, MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R. However, the results from our present study indicate that the d-Phe7 substitution in ACTH not only deceased ligand binding affinity but also decreased ligand potency at MC2R, suggesting that the role of Phe in ACTH at MC2R is different from that at other MCRs. Our previous results indicate that d-Nal(2′)7 replacement in α-MSH (SHU9119) switches the ligand from agonist to antagonist at MC3R and MC4R (21.Yang Y. Chen M. Lai Y. Gantz I. Georgeson K.E.

However, in our present study, d-Nal(2′) substitution in ACTH did not switch the ligand from agonist to antagonist at hMC2R, suggesting that an aromatic side chain in position 7 of α-MSH is crucial for receptor activation at MC3R and MC4R, but not at MC2R. The role of Phe7 in ACTH at MC2R is different from that in MSH at other MCRs. GPCRs play fundamental roles in regulating the activity of human body. Upon binding of extracellular ligands, GPCRs interact with a specific subset of heterotrimeric G proteins that can then, in their activated forms, inhibit or activate various effector enzymes and/or ion channels. Ligand binding to GPCRs causes defined conformational changes in the receptor protein that promote its interaction with distinct classes of G protein heterotrimers (consisting of α-, β-, and γ-subunits) that are attached to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. This ligand-GPCR interaction eventually leads to the desired physiological response. The MCR family has five receptor subtypes. These MCRs share common receptor architecture, but these subtype receptors display different pharmacological profiles as evidenced by their ability to recognize a diverse array of endogenous or synthetic agonists. MC2R is unique of all MCRs, and ACTH is the only endogenous agonist at MC2R. Sequence analysis of MC2R indicated that MC2R is different from the other MCRs. In this study, we utilized chimeric receptors to determine which region of MC2R is crucial for ligand selectivity. Chimeric receptors have been widely used for delineating the domains involved in the ligand binding specificity of GPCRs. The chimeric receptors constructed between MC2R and MC4R transmembrane segments have provided specific insights into the regions in MC2R that confer ACTH selectivity. Due to the fact that the chimeric receptors that use MC2R as a template have very low receptor protein expression on the cell surface and make receptor pharmacological analysis not feasible, chimeric receptors that use MC4R as a template provide us with a good alternative. Our results indicate that the chimeric receptors that use MC4R as a template were highly expressed at the cell surface, and functional analysis of these chimeric receptors provided us with very important information on the MC2R transmembrane region in ligand selectivity. Our results indicate that replacement of TM3 in MC4R with the corresponding region in MC2R significantly decreased [d-Phe7]ACTH(1–24) binding affinity and potency, suggesting that TM3 of MC2R is important for Phe7 selectivity and potency at MC2R. Furthermore, substitution of MC4R TM3 with MC2R TM3 significantly reduced ligand potency with Phe7, suggesting that the conformation of Phe in the ligand plays different roles in MC2R and MC4R. Based on our MCR work and that of others, electrostatic and hydrophobic forces have been proposed to be involved in ACTH binding and receptor activation at MC2R. An MC2R computer model has been developed (Peptide Synthesis and Molecular Recognition Lab, University of Michigan). In this model, Asp103 and Asp107 of hMC2R have been hypothesized to form an ionic interaction with Arg8 of ACTH(1–24). In the model, the positively charged Arg8 of peptides is located close to the extracellular surface of the receptor, and it participates in the H-bond network with acidic residues from TM3 (Asp103 and Asp107). Phe7 is most essential for ligand docking into the MC2R-binding pocket, although this residue has no direct interaction with receptor residues. Its aromatic ring is situated on the bottom of the receptor pocket. The structure and conformation of Phe, d-Phe, and d-Nal(2′) are different, and therefore, their positions in the binding pocket are different. The conformation of these residues may play an important role in different ACTH analog selectivities. d-Phe or d-Nal(2′) in the ligand may prevent Arg8 interacting with Asp103 and Asp107. GPCRs are the major targets of today's medicines. To determine the mechanism of activation of GPCRs and the interaction of these receptors with their ligands, mutagenesis studies have proven to be a powerful tool and have provided insight into the structure and function of GPCRs. However, GPCR mutagenesis studies have limitations. They have identified that the peptide and non-peptide ligands have different binding sites at the receptor, but they could not provide further detailed information on whether different agonists will result in different GPCR conformations. A new approach is therefore required to determine the conformational change mediated by different ligands. Biophysical NMR may provide a new approach to ligand binding (either kinetic or conformational details). In future studies, we will combine mutagenesis studies with structural analyses (with crystals and NMR), including iterative modeling and detailed spectroscopy (fluorescence resonance energy transfer and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer). We will use solution- and solid-state NMR approaches to examine receptor-ligand interaction and receptor activation. This approach will provide structural information on receptor-ligand interactions and the dynamic aspects of GPCR structure. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Phe7 in ACTH plays an important role in ligand binding affinity and potency at MC2R, and its role is different from that of other MCRs. TM3 of MC2R plays an important role in ligand selectivity and potency. This study may be valuable for future design of selective MCR ligands.

https://openalex.org/W2004496491,"RNase HII removes RNA from RNA/DNA hybrids, such as single ribonucleotides and RNA primers generated during DNA synthesis. Both, RNase HII substrates and RNase HII deficiency have been associated with genome instability in several organisms, and genome instability is a major force leading to the acquisition of drug resistance in bacteria. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon is one of the challenges in identifying efficient methods to combat bacterial pathogens. The aim of the present study was set to investigate the role of rnhB, presumably encoding RNase HII, in maintaining genome stability in the M. tuberculosis model organism Mycobacterium smegmatis. We performed gene replacement through homologous recombination to obtain mutant strains of Mycobacterium smegmatis lacking the rnhB gene. The mutants did not present an altered phenotype, according to the growth rate in liquid culture or susceptibility to hydroxyurea, and did not show an increase in the spontaneous mutation rate, determined using the Luria-Delbrück fluctuation test for streptomycin resistance in bacteria. The mutants also did not present an increase in the level of RNase HII substrates, measured as the level of alkaline degradation of chromosomal DNA or determined through immunodetection. We conclude that proteins other than RnhB proteins efficiently remove RNase HII substrates in M. smegmatis. These results highlight differences in the basic biology between Mycobacteria and eukaryotes and between different species of bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1968663143,"One of the crucial steps toward understanding the biological functions of a cellular system is to investigate protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. As an increasing number of reliable PPIs become available, there is a growing need for discovering PPIs to reconstruct PPI networks of interesting organisms. Some interolog-based methods and homologous PPI families have been proposed for predicting PPIs from the known PPIs of source organisms.Here, we propose a multiple-strategy scoring method to identify reliable PPIs for reconstructing the mouse PPI network from two well-known organisms: human and fly. We firstly identified the PPI candidates of target organisms based on homologous PPIs, sharing significant sequence similarities (joint E-value ≤ 1 × 10(-40)), from source organisms using generalized interolog mapping. These PPI candidates were evaluated by our multiple-strategy scoring method, combining sequence similarities, normalized ranks, and conservation scores across multiple organisms. According to 106,825 PPI candidates in yeast derived from human and fly, our scoring method can achieve high prediction accuracy and outperform generalized interolog mapping. Experiment results show that our multiple-strategy score can avoid the influence of the protein family size and length to significantly improve PPI prediction accuracy and reflect the biological functions. In addition, the top-ranked and conserved PPIs are often orthologous/essential interactions and share the functional similarity. Based on these reliable predicted PPIs, we reconstructed a comprehensive mouse PPI network, which is a scale-free network and can reflect the biological functions and high connectivity of 292 KEGG modules, including 216 pathways and 76 structural complexes.Experimental results show that our scoring method can improve the predicting accuracy based on the normalized rank and evolutionary conservation from multiple organisms. Our predicted PPIs share similar biological processes and cellular components, and the reconstructed genome-wide PPI network can reflect network topology and modularity. We believe that our method is useful for inferring reliable PPIs and reconstructing a comprehensive PPI network of an interesting organism."

An ortholog has been shown to perform a similar function in the pathogenic fungus Candida glabrata, but with the distinction that CgOpi1p is essential for growth in this organism. However, in the more distantly related yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, the OPI1 homolog was not found to regulate inositol biosynthesis, but alkane oxidation. In Candida albicans, the most common cause of human candidiasis, its Opi1p homolog, CaOpi1p, has been shown to complement a S. cerevisiae opi1∆ mutant for inositol biosynthesis regulation when heterologously expressed, suggesting it might serve a similar role in this pathogen. This was tested in the pathogen directly in this report by disrupting the OPI1 homolog and examining its phenotypes. It was discovered that the OPI1 homolog does not regulate INO1 expression in C. albicans, but it does control SAP2 expression in response to bovine serum albumin containing media. Meanwhile, we found that CaOpi1 represses filamentous growth at lower temperatures (30°C) on agar, but not in liquid media. Although, the mutant does not affect virulence in a mouse model of systemic infection, it does affect virulence in a rat model of vaginitis. This may be because Opi1p regulates expression of the SAP2 protease, which is required for rat vaginal infections."
https://openalex.org/W2000627813,"The faithful translation of the genetic code requires the highly accurate aminoacylation of transfer RNAs (tRNAs). However, it has been shown that nematode-specific V-arm-containing tRNAs (nev-tRNAs) are misacylated with leucine in vitro in a manner that transgresses the genetic code. nev-tRNAGly (CCC) and nev-tRNAIle (UAU), which are the major nev-tRNA isotypes, could theoretically decode the glycine (GGG) codon and isoleucine (AUA) codon as leucine, causing GGG and AUA codon ambiguity in nematode cells. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the functionality of nev-tRNAs and their impact on the proteome of Caenorhabditis elegans. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences in the 3’ end regions of the nev-tRNAs showed that they had matured correctly, with the addition of CCA, which is a crucial posttranscriptional modification required for tRNA aminoacylation. The nuclear export of nev-tRNAs was confirmed with an analysis of their subcellular localization. These results show that nev-tRNAs are processed to their mature forms like common tRNAs and are available for translation. However, a whole-cell proteome analysis found no detectable level of nev-tRNA-induced mistranslation in C. elegans cells, suggesting that the genetic code is not ambiguous, at least under normal growth conditions. Our findings indicate that the translational fidelity of the nematode genetic code is strictly maintained, contrary to our expectations, although deviant tRNAs with misacylation properties are highly conserved in the nematode genome."
https://openalex.org/W2135349055,"Visual perception is burdened with a highly discontinuous input stream arising from saccadic eye movements. For successful integration into a coherent representation, the visuomotor system needs to deal with these self-induced perceptual changes and distinguish them from external motion. Forward models are one way to solve this problem where the brain uses internal monitoring signals associated with oculomotor commands to predict the visual consequences of corresponding eye movements during active exploration. Visual scenes typically contain a rich structure of spatial relational information, providing additional cues that may help disambiguate self-induced from external changes of perceptual input. We reasoned that a weighted integration of these two inherently noisy sources of information should lead to better perceptual estimates. Volunteer subjects performed a simple perceptual decision on the apparent displacement of a visual target, jumping unpredictably in sync with a saccadic eye movement. In a critical test condition, the target was presented together with a flanker object, where perceptual decisions could take into account the spatial distance between target and flanker object. Here, precision was better compared to control conditions in which target displacements could only be estimated from either extraretinal or visual relational information alone. Our findings suggest that under natural conditions, integration of visual space across eye movements is based upon close to optimal integration of both retinal and extraretinal pieces of information."

Here we examine relationships between gestational obesity and offspring gene variations on expression levels. Methods Whole-genome genotyping and gene expression analyses in blood of 22 BMS and 23 AMS offspring from 19 mothers were conducted using Illumina HumanOmni-5-Quad and HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips, respectively. Using PLINK we analyzed interactions between offspring gene variations and maternal surgical status on offspring gene expression levels. Altered biological functions and pathways were identified and visualized using DAVID and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Results Significant interactions (p ≤ 1.22x10-12) were found for 525 among the 16,060 expressed transcripts: 1.9% of tested SNPs were involved. Gene function and pathway analysis demonstrated enrichment of transcription and of cellular metabolism functions and overrepresentation of cellular stress and signaling, immune response, inflammation, growth, proliferation and development pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2090572865,"The floral traits of bisexual flowers may evolve in response to selection on both male and female functions, but the relative importance of selection associated with each of these two aspects is poorly resolved. Sexually dimorphic traits in plants with unisexual flowers may reflect gender-specific selection, providing opportunities for gaining an increased understanding of the evolution of specific floral traits. We examined sexually dimorphic patterns of floral traits in perfect and female flowers of the gynodioecious species Cyananthus delavayi. A special corolla appendage, the throat hair, was investigated experimentally to examine its influences on male and female function. We found that perfect flowers have larger corollas and much longer throat hairs than female flowers, while female ones have much exerted stigmas. The presence of throat hairs prolonged the duration of pollen presentation by restricting the amount of pollen removed by pollen-collecting bees during each visit. Floral longevity was negatively related to the rate of pollen removal. When pollen removal rate was limited in perfect flowers, the duration of the female phases diminished with the increased male phase duration. There was a weak negative correlation between throat hair length and seed number per fruit in female flowers, but this correlation was not significant in perfect flowers. These results suggest that throat hairs may enhance male function in terms of prolonged pollen presentation. However, throat hairs have no obvious effect on female function in terms of seed number per fruit. The marked sexual dimorphism of this corolla appendage in C. delavayi is likely to have evolved and been maintained by gender-specific selection."

If p < 0.05, the model may not be directly transported to the external validation population without further revision or updating.

Long term time lapse observations in HCT116 cells bearing a fluorescence ubiquitin-based cell cycle indicator identified a characteristic population that is viable but remains in the G1 phase for an extended period of time (up to 56 h). Microarray analyses showed that expression of RFPL4A was significantly up-regulated in these G1-arrested cells, not only in HCT116 cells but also in other cancer cell lines, and overexpression of RFPL4A increased the G1 population and decreased sensitivity to chemotherapy. However, knockdown of RFPL4A expression caused the cells to resume mitosis and induced their susceptibility to anti-cancer drugs in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that RFPL4A is a novel factor that increases the G1 population and decreases sensitivity to chemotherapy and thus may be a promising therapeutic target for refractory tumor conditions."
