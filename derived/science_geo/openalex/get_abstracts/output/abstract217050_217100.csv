A technique for recording such changes has been developed, and preliminary results with cats and human beings are reported with attention being given to differences between the sexes in response to particular types of material."

Subjects remained ignorant of their behavior and its effect. Their cumulative response curves resembled those obtained in similar work with animals. Other subjects, informed of the effective response, could not produce it deliberately in a size small enough to qualify for reinforcement."

https://openalex.org/W1973818220,"A new and simple technique has been developed (10) for correcting C(14) radioactivity measurements for loss of radiation due to self-absorption. Results are discussed which show the applicability of the technique for many different counting situations. It is found that the absorption of radiation follows a hyperbolic law much more closely than an exponential one. Furthermore, the absorption coefficient for the sample itself has been found to be a function of weight rather than a constant, as had been assumed for the derivation of the law of exponential absorption."

https://openalex.org/W2006510949,"SODIUM salicylate is known to cause a loss of potassium from rat diaphragms1. It is also known to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation2, and it is suggested1 that the loss of potassium is due to an interference with the energy supplies for active transport. If so, the inward movement of potassium should be decreased in the presence of salicylate and the outward movement unaltered or decreased as the intracellular concentration of potassium falls."

https://openalex.org/W1985753189,VILLANUEVA1 recently directed attention to the interference by azide in diazotization procedures used in assay systems. He suggested that the reported inhibition by azide of numerous enzyme systems in which nitrite production has been measured might require re-investigation.
https://openalex.org/W1981188644,"SEVERAL workers have shown that lignin and the ‘B ring’ of flavonoids are formed in vivo from shikimic acid and certain C6C3 compounds. The latter compounds are frequently encountered in plant tissues1. The ‘A ring’ of flavonoids appears to arise from acetate units2. However, the occurrence of the free ‘A ring’ or simple derivatives of it have rarely been reported. We have found that on acid treatment kinos yield phloroglucinol, but bark and wood polyphenols do not."
https://openalex.org/W2044660364,"IT has long been known that the administration of thyroxine to rats, or any other species, is followed by an increase in their basal metabolic rate. In the present experiments rats fed thyroid were found to respond to the injection of adrenaline by a further marked and sustained rise in oxygen consumption. No such increase could be demonstrated in normal control animals. This increased sensitivity of hyperthyroid rats to adrenaline, as reflected in their oxygen consumption, was used to examine the release of adrenaline in insulin hypoglycaemia."
https://openalex.org/W2024189018,"THE traditional method of preparing kidney for microdissection is by maceration of formalin-fixed tissue with concentrated hydrochloric acid1. This method gives an, excellent preparation of loosened nephrons and collecting tubules that can be disentangled and studied by microdissection. However, it suffers from the disadvantage that the acid treatment changes the nuclei so that they cannot be demonstrated in dissected preparations by the usual staining methods. A method of maceration that would allow nuclear staining after dissection would considerably widen the scope of the technique."

https://openalex.org/W2009656381,"WE recently published a report on the growth stimulation of Microbacterium sp. by ‘iron transport factors’ such as ferrichrome, coprogen and the terregens factor1. These factors acted by decreasing the duration of the lag-phase of growth and were by no means essential. The culture resembled M. lacticum more closely than M. flavum, but possessed characteristics of both species. We felt it of interest to determine whether authentic species of Microbacterium were also stimulated by such factors."
