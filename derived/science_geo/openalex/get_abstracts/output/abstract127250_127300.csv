https://openalex.org/W2006047257,"Distinct classes of motor neurons and ventral interneurons are generated by the graded signaling activity of Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh controls neuronal fate by establishing different progenitor cell populations in the ventral neural tube that are defined by the expression of Pax6 and Nkx2.2. Pax6 establishes distinct ventral progenitor cell populations and controls the identity of motor neurons and ventral interneurons, mediating graded Shh signaling in the ventral spinal cord and hindbrain."
https://openalex.org/W2039248606,"Mutations at the mouse Fused locus have pleiotropic developmental effects, including the formation of axial duplications in homozygous embryos. The product of the Fused locus, Axin, displays similarities to RGS (egulators of -Protein ignaling) and Dishevelled proteins. Mutant Fused alleles that cause axial duplications disrupt the major mRNA, suggesting that Axin negatively regulates the response to an axis-inducing signal. Injection of Axin mRNA into Xenopus embryos inhibits dorsal axis formation by interfering with signaling through the Wnt pathway. Furthermore, ventral injection of an Axin mRNA lacking the RGS domain induces an ectopic axis, apparently through a dominant-negative mechanism. Thus, Axin is a novel inhibitor of Wnt signaling and regulates an early step in embryonic axis formation in mammals and amphibians."
https://openalex.org/W2054338068,"The hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 is essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. Using the conserved zinc finger DNA-binding domain of GATA-1 in the yeast two- hybrid system, we have identified a novel, multitype zinc finger protein, riend f ATA-1 (FOG), which binds GATA-1 but not a functionally inactive mutant lacking the amino (N) finger. FOG is coexpressed with GATA-1 during embryonic development and in erythroid and megakaryocytic cells. Furthermore, FOG and GATA-1 synergistically activate transcription from a hematopoietic-specific regulatory region and cooperate during both erythroid and megakaryocytic cell differentiation. These findings indicate that FOG acts as a cofactor for GATA-1 and provide a paradigm for the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression by GATA transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1637420145,"Reef-building corals are obligate, mutualistic symbioses of heterotrophic animals and phototrophic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.). Contrary to the earlier, widely accepted belief that corals harbour only one symbiont, we found that the ecologically dominant Caribbean corals Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata can act as hosts to dynamic, multi-species communities of Symbiodinium. Composition of these communities follows gradients of environmental irradiance, implying that physiological acclimatization is not the only mechanism by which corals cope with environmental heterogeneity. The importance of this diversity was underlined by analysis of a natural episode of coral bleaching. Patterns of bleaching could be explained by the preferential elimination of a symbiont associated with low irradiance from the brightest parts of its distribution. Comparative analyses of symbionts before and after bleaching from the same corals supported this interpretation, and suggested that some corals were protected from bleaching by hosting an additional symbiont that is more tolerant of high irradiance and temperature. This 'natural experiment' suggests that temporal and spatial variability can favour the coexistence of diverse symbionts within a host, despite the potential for destabilizing competition among them."
https://openalex.org/W2081032844,"We describe the purification and characterization of ACF, an ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor. ACF is a multisubunit factor that contains ISWI protein and is distinct from NURF, another ISWI-containing factor. In chromatin assembly, purified ACF and a core histone chaperone (such as NAP-1 or CAF-1) are sufficient for the ATP-dependent formation of periodic nucleosome arrays. In chromatin remodeling, ACF is able to modulate the internucleosomal spacing of chromatin by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Moreover, ACF can mediate promoter-specific nucleosome reconfiguration by Gal4-VP16 in an ATP-dependent manner. These results suggest that ACF acts catalytically both in chromatin assembly and in the remodeling of nucleosomes that occurs during transcriptional activation."
https://openalex.org/W1614420319,"How are signalling molecules organized into different pathways within the same cell? In Drosophila, the inaD gene encodes a protein consisting of five PDZ domains which serves as a scaffold to assemble different components of the phototransduction cascade, including the principal light-activated ion channels, the effector phospholipase C-beta and protein kinase C. Null inaD mutants have a dramatically reorganized subcellular distribution of signalling molecules, and a total loss of transduction complexes. Also, mutants defective in a single PDZ domain produce signalling complexes that lack the target protein and display corresponding defects in their physiology. A picture emerges of a highly organized unit of signalling, a 'transduclisome', with PDZ domains functioning as key elements in the organization of transduction complexes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1979723665,"Exposure of E. coli to hydrogen peroxide induces the transcription of a small RNA denoted oxyS. The oxyS RNA is stable, abundant, and does not encode a protein. oxyS activates and represses the expression of numerous genes in E. coli, and eight targets, including genes encoding the transcriptional regulators FhlA and sigma(S), were identified. oxyS expression also leads to a reduction in spontaneous and chemically-induced mutagenesis. Our results suggest that the oxyS RNA acts as a regulator that integrates adaptation to hydrogen peroxide with other cellular stress responses and helps to protect cells against oxidative damage."
https://openalex.org/W2058618870,"Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) is rapidly taken up by cells and reduced to ascorbic acid (AA). Using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system we examined transport of DHA and AA via glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1–5 and SGLT1. The apparentK m of DHA transport via GLUT1 and GLUT3 was 1.1 ± 0.2 and 1.7 ± 0.3 mm, respectively. High performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed 100% reduction of DHA to AA within oocytes. GLUT4 transport of DHA was only 2–4-fold above control and transport kinetics could not be calculated. GLUT2, GLUT5, and SGLT1 did not transport DHA and none of the isoforms transported AA. Radiolabeled sugar transport confirmed transporter function and identity of all cDNA clones was confirmed by restriction fragment mapping. GLUT1 and GLUT3 cDNA were further verified by polymerase chain reaction. DHA transport activity in both GLUT1 and GLUT3 was inhibited by 2-deoxyglucose, d-glucose, and 3-O-methylglucose among other hexoses while fructose and l-glucose showed no inhibition. Inhibition by the endofacial inhibitor, cytochalasin B, was non-competitive and inhibition by the exofacial inhibitor, 4,6-O-ethylidene-α-glucose, was competitive. Expressed mutant constructs of GLUT1 and GLUT3 did not transport DHA. DHA and 2-deoxyglucose uptake by Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing either GLUT1 or GLUT3 was increased 2–8-fold over control cells. These studies suggest GLUT1 and GLUT3 isoforms are the specific glucose transporter isoforms which mediate DHA transport and subsequent accumulation of AA.

Once within cells, dehydroascorbic acid is immediately reduced to ascorbate by both chemical and protein mediated processes (15Washko P.W. Wang Y. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Winkler B.S. Orselli S.M. Rex T.S. Free Rad. Biol.

Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Dehydroascorbic acid is structurally similar to glucose. Therefore, DHA entry has been proposed to be mediated by glucose transporters (12Kern H.L. Zolot S.L. Curr. Eye Res. 1987; 6: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Ingermann R.L.

Despite investigations in several cell types, this hypothesis has not been proven. The ideal means to verify it is to express glucose transporters using an expression system, and to study DHA transport activity. If any transporters were active, transport kinetics could be characterized only under conditions of 100% internal reduction to ascorbate, consistent with DHA transport into cells being rate-limiting (7Welch R.W. Wang Y. Crossman Jr., A. Park J.B. Kirk K.L. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12584-12592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). If internal DHA reduction were incomplete, kinetics could not be calculated. Although one study characterized DHA transport by expressed GLUT1 (21Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), there were a number of flaws in this report. Experiments were performed using mixtures of ascorbic acid and ascorbic acid oxidase instead of pure DHA as substrate. There was insufficient data about internal DHA reduction at each external DHA concentration, and calculations of high affinity transport were based on incorrect mathematical assumptions. In addition, although DHA transport was attributed to GLUT2 and GLUT4 as well, no data were presented to support these conclusions. To characterize dehydroascorbic acid and ascorbate transport we utilized a Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system to express glucose transport isoforms GLUT1–5 (22Birnbaum M.J. Haspel H.C.

The data here indicate that DHA is transported by GLUT1 and GLUT3 but not other isoforms, while ascorbate is not transported by any of the proteins studied. Rat GLUT1 and human GLUT2, -3, -4, and -5 and mutant GLUT3 (Trp410 → Leu) were obtained as plasmid constructs from G. I. Bell (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). Mutant GLUT1 (Gln161 → Leu) was obtained from M. Mueckler (28Mueckler M. Weng W. Kruse M. J. Biol.

The GLUT3 construct is a 2153-base pair fragment of human GLUT3 generated by PCR and inserted into the AslI/BamHI site of pGEM4Z. mRNA was prepared from each construct in vitro by digesting plasmid vectors with appropriate restriction enzymes andin vitro transcription utilizing SP6 or T3 (mMessage mMachine, Ambion, Austin, TX). GLUT1–5 and SGLT1 were analyzed by enzymatic restriction fragment digestion (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). GLUT1 and GLUT3 constructs were further analyzed by PCR amplification. Primer pairs specific for GLUT1 (5′-GCCATGGAGCCCAGCAGCAAG-3′, 5′-CACTTGGGAATCAGCCCCCAG-3′) and GLUT3 (5′-ATGGGGACACAGAAGGTCACC-3′, 5′-GACATTGGTGGTGGTCTCCTT-3′) were used to amplify the coding sequence of GLUT1 and GLUT3 (1480 and 1488 base pairs, respectively). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using phosphoramidite chemistry (Lofstrand Labs, Gaithersburg MD). PCR conditions consisted of 25 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C/1 min at 56 °C/2 min at 72 °C, and 10 min at 72 °C. Primer pairs failed to amplify DNA from non-appropriate templates. Gel electrophoresis was performed utilizing 1% agarose (SeaKem, Rockland, ME) in TBE buffer. Reference markers used included 1Kb ladder (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and φX174/HaeIII digest (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Oocytes were isolated fromX. laevis and injected with mRNA using established methods (32Soreq H. Seidman S. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 225-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, ovaries were resected from adult female frogs anesthetized with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (2 g/750 ml) (Sigma) in ice water. Ovarian lobes were opened and incubated in two changes of OR-2 without calcium (5 mm HEPES, 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.8) with collagenase (2 mg/ml) (Sigma) for 30 min each at 23 °C. Individual oocytes (stages V and VI) were isolated from connective tissue and vasculature and were transferred to calcium-containing OR-2 (1 mm CaCl2) and maintained at 18–20 °C until injection with mRNA. Oocytes were injected utilizing a pressure controlled injector (Eppendorf Transjector model #5246, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). mRNA was backloaded into a capillary glass pipette, which had been pulled to a fine point using a micropipette puller (P-77, Sutter, Novato, CA). Injection volume was calibrated initially utilizing radiolabeled mRNA preparations. Injection volume was 30–50 nl and mRNA concentration was 0.07–1.0 mg/ml as indicated. After injection, oocytes were placed at 20 °C in OR-2 containing 1 mm pyruvate with daily media changes. Experiments were performed on day 3 after mRNA injection unless indicated. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) transfected with rat GLUT1 (CHO:G15) or rat GLUT5 (CHO:F20) were obtained from Y. Oka (33Shibasaki Y. Asano T. Lin J.L. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Ishihara H. Yazaki Y.

Human GLUT3 transfected (CHO:G3) and wild-type non-transfected CHO cells (CHO:K1) were obtained from J. Takeda (36Maher F. Vannucci S. Takeda J. Simpson I.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). Wild-type, CHO:G15, and CHO:F20 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 with 10% fetal calf serum and 1000 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. CHO:G3 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 1000 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 nm methotrexate. [14C]DHA was prepared from crystalline [14C]ascorbic acid (NEN Life Sciences Products Inc., 6.6 mCi/mmol) as described (15Washko P.W. Wang Y. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of bromine solution (Fluka, Ronkonkoma, NY) was added to 600 μl of [14C]ascorbic acid solubilized in ultrapure water at a concentration of 20 mm, vortexed briefly and immediately purged with nitrogen on ice in the dark for 10 min. HPLC with radiomatic detection confirmed 100% conversion of AA to DHA, which could be completely recovered upon reduction with 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (37Dhariwal K.R. Washko P.W. Levine M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Transport of [14C]AA, [14C]DHA, 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (NEN Life Products, 26.2 Ci/mmol), d-[U-14C]fructose (NEN Life Sciences Products, 302 mCi/mmol), andd-[U-14C]glucose (NEN Life Sciences Products, 265 mCi/mmol) was examined by incubating groups of 10–20 oocytes at 23 °C in OR-2 containing different concentrations of freshly prepared [14C]AA or [14C]DHA (0.6–5.5 μCi/ml) or sugar (0.5–1.0 μCi/ml labeled sugar with added non-labeled sugar) for 15 s to 10 min. After incubation, oocytes were washed immediately 4 times with 200–400 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm phloretin. Inhibitors or competitors were added to the incubation as described in the text. Individual oocytes were either dissolved in 500 μl of 10% SDS and internalized radioactivity was measured using scintillation spectrometry, or oocytes were frozen to −70 °C in 50 μl of 60% MeOH, 1 mm EDTA for later HPLC analysis. To measure [14C]DHA or 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake in CHO cells, confluent cells in 12-well plates were washed 2 times with Krebs buffer (30 mm HEPES, 130 mmNaCl, 4 mm KH2PO4, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4), and incubated at 23 °C for 5 min with Krebs buffer containing different concentrations of substrate. Afterward, cells were washed 4 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mmglucose, solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH, 1% CHAPS (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, La Jolla, CA) and radioactivity was measured by scintillation spectrometry. Protein content of wells was measured by spectrophotometry using bicinchoninic acid (BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit, Pierce, Rockford IL). Oocyte total AA mass and internalized AA and DHA radioactivity were measured using HPLC. AA mass was determined using electrochemical detection (4Washko P. Rotrosen D. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18996-19002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Internalized radioactivity was determined using the same HPLC system followed by on-line scintillation spectrometry (Packard Series A-120 Flo-one radiomatic detector (Downers Grove, IL)). Prior to HPLC analysis, oocytes previously frozen in 60% MeOH, 1 mm EDTA were thawed on ice, lysed by agitation with a pipette tip, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and analyzed by HPLC. MeOH was confirmed to extract 100% of AA and DHA from oocytes (data not shown). Data are expressed as the arithmetic mean ± S.D. of 10–20 oocytes at each data point, unless otherwise indicated. S.D. is not displayed when smaller than the symbol size. Transport kinetics were analyzed by best-fit analysis of data points utilizing curve-fitting (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) or Eadie-Hofstee transformation. IC50 values for DHA inhibition were determined by fitting data to a logit-log plot. We investigated DHA and ascorbate transport by GLUT1–5 and SGLT1. mRNA coding for the individual isoforms was injected intoXenopus oocytes and concentration-dependent DHA transport activity was assessed (Fig. 1). Radiolabeled 2-DG, fructose, or glucose uptake performed within the same experiment was a positive control for transporter activity. [14C]DHA transport in GLUT1 and GLUT3 expressing oocytes was over 100-fold greater than control sham-injected oocytes and similar to 2-[3H]DG transport on a mole for mole basis. DHA transport by oocytes expressing GLUT2, GLUT5, and SGLT1 did not differ from sham-injected controls. Oocytes expressing GLUT4 transported 2–4-fold more DHA than control, but 2-DG transport was an order of magnitude greater. Uptake of radiolabeled sugars for the different transporters was in the range expected (38Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 39Keller K. Mueckler M. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1990; 49: 1201-1203PubMed Google Scholar). Ascorbate transport by GLUT1–5 and SGLT1 was not different from sham-injected controls (<1 pmol/oocyte/10-min incubation) (data not shown). We verified the identity of the GLUT1 and GLUT3 cDNA constructs utilizing restriction digestion and PCR (Fig. 2). Restriction digestion of GLUT1 and GLUT3 insert DNA usingHindIII and EcoRI gave predicted fragments based on known sequences of GLUT1 and GLUT3 cDNA (22Birnbaum M.J. Haspel H.C. Rosen O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5784-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 24Kayano T. Fukumoto H. Eddy R.L. Fan Y.-S. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Bell G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15245-15248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PCR performed using cDNA primers specific for either GLUT1 or GLUT3 cDNA, produced DNA products only when the appropriate primers were used. The identities of the other glucose transporter constructs were also confirmed by restriction digest mapping (data not shown). Injection conditions for GLUT1 and GLUT3 mRNA were determined based on post-injection time and amount of mRNA injected. Variation in injection amount of either mRNA from 2 to 10 ng/oocyte resulted in a linear increase in transport activity for both DHA and 2-DG, and activity achieved plateau at 20–40 ng mRNA/oocyte (data not shown). Transport activity increased over time post-injection, with maximal activity occurring at 3–5 days (data not shown). To determine DHA transport kinetics internal reduction of DHA to AA must be complete and efflux of DHA should not occur. To establish these conditions, we first examined concentration-dependent [14C]DHA uptake (0.1–8 mm) over 10 min into oocytes injected with 30 ng of GLUT1 mRNA (21Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Total radiolabeled uptake was measured, representing the sum of AA, DHA, and metabolites. The percentage of label present intracellularly as DHA, AA, or metabolites was also analyzed by HPLC and is displayed as % reduction to ascorbate. The results of total radiolabel data suggest that uptake saturated at 4 mm external DHA (Fig. 3). However, these observations can be explained by incomplete internal reduction of DHA to ascorbate (Fig. 3). Complete internal reduction occurred at [14C]DHA external concentrations ≤1 mm but reduction was incomplete at higher concentrations. [14C]DHA metabolites were only present when DHA reduction was incomplete (not shown). Under conditions of incomplete reduction transport kinetics cannot be calculated because reduction rather than transport becomes limiting. Similar results were obtained for GLUT3 (data not shown). Consistent with these observations, DHA efflux occurred from oocytes expressing GLUT1 or GLUT3 only when reduction was incomplete (data not shown). To achieve complete internal reduction, incubation time with substrates was decreased to ≤1 min for oocytes expressing either GLUT1 or GLUT3. For GLUT1 expressing oocytes, injected mRNA was also decreased to 2 ng/oocyte. Using these conditions, concentration-dependent DHA transport occurred in GLUT1 and GLUT3 expressing oocytes (Fig.4, A and B). At all concentrations of DHA, HPLC analysis confirmed 100% reduction of internalized label to AA (data not shown). For each concentration selected, uptake was linear with respect to time. Kinetic parameters of GLUT1- and GLUT3-mediated DHA transport were calculated using best-fit analysis and Eadie-Hofstee transformation (Fig. 4, A and B, inset). Using best-fit analysis, apparent K mwas 1.1 ± 0.2 mm and V max was 108 pmol/min/oocyte for GLUT1, and apparent K m was 1.7 ± 0.3 mm with V max of 241 pmol/min/oocyte for GLUT3. Eadie-Hofstee transformation yielded similar results. For GLUT1, apparent K m was 1.2 mm and V max was 124 pmol/min/oocyte, and for GLUT3 apparent K m was 1.1 mm andV max was 201 pmol/min/oocyte. We examined the ability of different sugars, ascorbic acid, and cytochalasins B and E to inhibit [14C]DHA transport in both GLUT1 and GLUT3 expressing oocytes (Table I). The relative ability of different sugars to inhibit DHA uptake was similar for both transport proteins (2-DG ≥ glucose ≥ 3-O-methylglucose > maltose > mannose > xylose). IC50 values were lower for GLUT3 for all of the sugars with an inhibitory effect. Cytochalasin B strongly inhibited DHA transport via both isoforms with an IC50 similar to that seen with transport of 2-[3H]DG under similar conditions (data not shown), while cytochalasin E had no effect. As expected, AA did not inhibit DHA uptake through either transporter.Table IInhibition (IC50(mm) of DHA transport in GLUT1 and GLUT3 expressing oocytesInhibitorTransporter isoformGLUT1GLUT32-Deoxyglucose7.14.9d-Glucose10.13.73-O-Methylglucose9.55.4Mannose24.58.5Xylose26.39.9Maltose>5020.9l-GlucoseNo effectNo effectFructoseNo effectNo effectAscorbic acidNo effectNo effectCytochalasin B0.00260.0018Cytochalasin ENo effectNo effectOocytes expressing either GLUT1 or GLUT3 were incubated with 150 μm [14C]DHA for 10 min at 23 °C in the presence of individual sugars, ascorbic acid (0.1–100 mm) or cytochalasin B or E (0.001–100 μm).

Glucose transporters possess both endofacial and exofacial substrate-binding sites (40Carruthers A. Helgerson A.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3907-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). When DHA is present externally, internal DHA is absent under conditions of complete internal reduction. Therefore, we anticipated that exofacial and endofacial inhibitors of glucose transport would behave differently with DHA as the substrate. We predicted that the endofacial glucose transport inhibitor cytochalasin B (41Basketter D.A. Widdas W.F. J. Physiol. 1978; 278: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 42Wang J.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5108-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) would behave as a competitive inhibitor. Oocytes expressing either GLUT1 or GLUT3 were incubated with increasing concentrations of DHA in the presence of either inhibitor under conditions of complete internal reduction (Fig.5). The results show ethylidene glucose was a competitive inhibitor of DHA uptake by GLUT1 and GLUT3. These data suggest that the external binding sites for ethylidene glucose and DHA are identical. Cytochalasin B inhibited DHA transport by GLUT1 and GLUT3 non-competitively. Glucose transporter mutants, previously constructed with single amino acid substitutions in domains believed to be important for glucose transport, were demonstrated to be defective in their ability to transport 2-DG (28Mueckler M.

If similar sites are involved in both DHA and 2-DG transport, transport of either substrate by these mutant constructs should be similar. We measured the ability of two mutants, GLUT1161 (Gln161 → Leu) and GLUT3410 (Trp410 → Leu), to transport 2-[3H]DG or [14C]DHA (TableII). Transport of both substrates via GLUT1 and GLUT3 was >100-fold higher than control and was virtually eliminated by the mutations. Western blotting demonstrated that both mutant proteins were present in the plasma membrane (data not shown).Table IIDHA and 2-DG transport in oocytes expressing glucose isoform mutants (pmol/oocyte/10 min)[14C]DHA2-[3H]DeoxyglucoseControl0.57 ± 0.50.65 ± 0.4GLUT1197.5 ± 61.1139.3 ± 18.6GLUT11611.8 ± 0.72.1 ± 0.5GLUT3182.4 ± 42.9155.1 ± 26.0GLUT34100.27 ± 0.30.65 ± 0.7Xenopus oocytes were injected with mRNA transcribed from normal or mutant (GLUT1161 and GLUT3410) cDNA constructs.

To confirm that GLUT1 and GLUT3 also transport DHA in mammalian cells, we examined DHA transport in cells overexpressing these proteins. DHA transport was measured in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with rat GLUT1, human GLUT3, or rat GLUT5. GLUT1 and GLUT3 overexpressing cells demonstrated a 2–8-fold increase in [14C]DHA uptake and a 2–18-fold increase in 2-DG uptake compared with control cells (Fig. 6). Increased transport activity of both substrates was inhibited by up to 95% by cytochalasin B (data not shown). GLUT5 overexpressing cells showed higher [14C]fructose transport but [14C]DHA uptake was no different from control (data not shown). In the present report we demonstrate that glucose transporter isoforms GLUT1 and GLUT3 mediate the transport of dehydroascorbic acid. Transport activity was demonstrated both in the Xenopusoocyte expression system and in CHO cells overexpressing these transport proteins. Mutant constructs of both GLUT1 and GLUT3 failed to transport DHA. Determination of DHA transport kinetics was performed under conditions of complete internal reduction of DHA to AA. This was confirmed at all external concentrations of DHA by HPLC. Without complete reduction, kinetics cannot be calculated because efflux of substrate occurs and the reduction process becomes rate-limiti"

https://openalex.org/W2076674954,"Previous work on the responses of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade components in aXenopus oocyte extract system demonstrated that p42 MAP kinase (MAPK) exhibits a sharp, sigmoidal stimulus/response curve, rather than a more typical hyperbolic curve. One plausible explanation for this behavior requires the assumption that MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK) carries out its dual phosphorylation of p42 MAPK by a distributive mechanism, where MAPKK dissociates from MAPK between the first and second phosphorylations, rather than a processive mechanism, where MAPKK carries out both phosphorylations before dissociating. Here we have investigated the mechanism through which a constitutively active form of human MAPKK-1 (denoted MAPKK-1 R4F or MAPKK-1*) phosphorylates Xenopus p42 MAPK in vitro. We found that the amount of monophosphorylated MAPK formed during the phosphorylation reaction exceeded the amount of MAPKK-1* present, which would not be possible if the phosphorylation occurred exclusively by a processive mechanism. The monophosphorylated MAPK was phosphorylated predominantly on tyrosine, but a small proportion was phosphorylated on threonine, indicating that the first phosphorylation is usually, but not invariably, the tyrosine phosphorylation. We also found that the rate at which pulse-labeled monophosphorylated MAPK became bisphosphorylated depended on the MAPKK-1* concentration, behavior that is predicted by the distributive model but incompatible with the processive model. These findings indicate that MAPKK-1* phosphorylates p42 MAPK by a two-collision, distributive mechanism rather than a single-collision, processive mechanism, and provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how MAP kinase can convert graded inputs into switch-like outputs."
https://openalex.org/W2154182477,"Double-stranded DNA break repair and homologous recombination in E. coli are initiated by the RecBCD enzyme, which unwinds and simultaneously degrades DNA from a double-stranded DNA end. This process is stimulated by cis-acting DNA elements, known as chi sites. Using both in vitro pairing and nuclease protection assays, we demonstrate that the translocating RecBCD enzyme, which has been activated by chi, coordinates the preferential loading of the homologous pairing protein, RecA, onto the resultant single-stranded DNA downstream of chi. This facilitated loading of RecA protein results in a substantial increase in both the efficiency and rate of in vitro recombination reactions and offers an explanation for stimulation of recombination and repair in vivo by chi."

In these cells, nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibited the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation induced by serum depletion, whereas Ang II antagonized this NGF cell survival action and induced apoptosis. We studied the mechanism of NGF and AT2 receptor interaction on apoptosis by examining their effects on the survival factor Bcl-2. AT2 receptor activation did affect intracellular Bcl-2 protein levels. Bcl-2 phosphorylation was stimulated by NGF, whereas AT2 receptor activation blocked this NGF effect. Pretreatment with antisense oligonucleotide of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1 enhanced the effects of NGF on MAP kinase activation and Bcl-2 phosphorylation but attenuated the inhibitory effects of AT2 receptor on MAP kinase, Bcl-2 phosphorylation, and apoptosis.

The AT2 receptor inhibits MAP kinase activation, resulting in the inactivation of Bcl-2 and the induction of apoptosis. The processes of cell survival and cell death involve highly regulated signaling pathways that are currently the subject of intense investigation. Apoptosis is a ubiquitous, evolutionally conserved, physiological mechanism of cell death that regulates tissue mass and architecture in many tissues (1Wyllie A.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The rat PC12W pheochromocytoma cell line is widely used to examine the molecular and cellular mechanism of apoptosis. Xia et al. (2Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeard J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) (p42 and p44 MAP kinases known as p42MAPK/ERK2 and p44MAPK/ERK1) act as survival signals, whereas c-JUN NH2-terminal protein kinase and p38 exert cell death signaling. In the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), the survival signal pathway is activated, whereas the cell death signaling pathway is suppressed. Angiotensin II (Ang II) exerts various actions in its diverse target tissues controlling vascular tone, hormone secretion, tissue growth, and neuronal activities primarily via Ang II type 1 receptor. Recently, a second receptor subtype known as AT2 receptor has been cloned (3Mukoyama M. Nakajima M. Horiuchi M. Sasamura H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Biol.

In this study, we hypothesize that this inactivation of MAP kinase plays a pivotal role in mediating apoptosis via the inactivation of the cell survival factor Bcl-2. Bcl-2 can prevent or delay apoptosis induced by a wide variety of stimuli and insults, suggesting that Bcl-2 controls a distal step in the final common pathway for cell death (9Reed J.C. J.

Recent data support that the post-translational modification of Bcl-2 such as phosphorylation is important for the regulation of Bcl-2 function (10May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstromg D.K.

Here, we demonstrated that MAP kinase phosphorylated Bcl-2 and AT2 receptor stimulation activated MAP kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and inhibited the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in PC12W cells, resulting in the induction of apoptosis. PC12W cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum. Cell number was counted by Coulter counter. PC12W cells were seeded onto a 10-cm dish (Becton Dickinson) at 2 × 10−6 cells/dish. The cells were first grown in serum-fed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then kept in serum-free medium for 12 h. The cells were washed three times in serum-free and phosphate-free medium and equilibrated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) at the concentration of 100 μCi/ml in phosphate-free medium for 12 h. The radiolabeled cells were treated with NGF (20 ng/ml), Ang II (10−8 and 10−7m), and/or PD123319 (10−5m) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 8,500 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 10 μg of Bcl-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 12 h. After precipitation with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), samples were boiled in Laemmli loading buffer for 3 min and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. The bands corresponding to the Bcl-2 were cut, and their radioactivity was measured. For immunoblotting, cell lysates (100 μg) were run on 12% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with Bcl-2 antibody or MKP-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies were detected by horse radish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody using ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) system (Amersham). For the assay of tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcl-2, the cells were grown in serum-free medium for 12 h and stimulated with NGF (20 ng/ml), Ang II (10−7m), and NGF (20 ng/ml) plus Ang II (10−7m). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Bcl-2 antibody (10 μg), resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.).

After transfection, the cells were maintained in the presence of 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 day. Then the medium was changed to serum-free medium with or without Ang II. Two days later, cells were harvested and subjected to analysis of DNA fragmentation. Anti-MKP-1 antisense transfected PC12W cells were also used for Bcl-2 phosphorylation, and MAP kinase activity determinations as described above.

DNA extraction, subsequent 3′ end labeling of DNA, gel electrophoresis, and quantitation of DNA fragmentation were performed as described previously (7Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl.

Statistical significance was assessed by ANOVA followed by Scheffe's test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. We recently demonstrated (7Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) that AT2 receptor antagonizes the anti-apoptotic effect of NGF and induces apoptosis in PC12W cells, which express abundant AT2 receptor and very low levels of Ang II type 1 receptor (17Speth R.C,. Kim K.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the possibility that the AT2 receptor regulates apoptosis via its influence on Bcl-2 (Fig. 1). We first stimulated these cells with NGF and then studied the effect of Ang II on Bcl-2 protein levels. We observed that the Bcl-2 level was not changed with Ang II (Fig.1 B). Since phosphorylation of Bcl-2 is essential for its physiological function (10May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstromg D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Halder S. Jena N. Groce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S.

Yazaki Y. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24793-24803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we then focused on the effect of AT2 receptor on the Bcl-2 phosphorylation. PC12W cells were equilibrated with [32P]orthophosphoric acid in phosphate-free medium, and the radiolabeled cells were treated with NGF (20 ng/ml), Ang II (10−8 and 10−7m), and PD123319 (10−5m) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Bcl-2 antibody, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. As shown in Fig.1, A and C, we observed that NGF stimulated the phophorylation of Bcl-2, whereas Ang II inhibited the NGF-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). Inhibition of the NGF-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by Ang II was restored by PD123319, a specific AT2 receptor antagonist, suggesting that this Ang II effect is exerted specifically via the AT2 receptor. Since the signaling pathway through MAP kinases appears to play a critical role in the survival of PC12W cells (2Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeard J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar), we postulated that MAP kinase enhances Bcl-2 phosphorylation and that the AT2 receptor inhibits this. MAP kinase activity is regulated by a dual-specificity phosphatase known as MKP-1 (18Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), leading us to hypothesize that the AT2 receptor activates MKP-1, inhibits NGF-mediated MAP kinase activation, and results in the inhibition of Bcl-2 phosphorylation. We applied antisense oligonucleotide to block basal MKP-1 expression in PC12W cells. Due to the short half-life of MKP-1 mRNA and protein, MKP-1 is an ideal target molecule for studies with antisense inhibition. PC12W cells were transfected with 300 nmanti-MKP-1 antisense or sense oligonucleotides. Indeed, we observed that MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide treatment reduced the level of MKP-1 protein (Fig. 2 A). In MKP-1 sense oligonucleotide-pretreated PC12W cells, NGF increased MAP kinase activity and AT2 receptor stimulation inhibited the NGF-mediated MAP kinase activation as well as the basal level of MAP kinase activity (Fig. 2 B). We demonstrated that MKP-1 antisense pretreatment enhanced the effect of NGF on MAP kinase activation in PC12W cells (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, we observed that the MKP-1 antisense pretreatment attenuated the antagonistic effect of the AT2 receptor on NGF-mediated MAP kinase activation (Fig. 2 B). We next examined the effect of MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide on Bcl-2 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 3, A–C, we observed that the NGF-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 was enhanced by MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide pretreatment, suggesting that MAP kinase activation is closely linked to phosphorylation of Bcl-2. Moreover, MKP-1 blockade attenuated the inhibitory effect of the AT2 receptor on Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Since MKP-1 possesses tyrosine phosphatase activity (18Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), we also examined the possibility that MKP-1 directly dephosphorylates the tyrosine residue of Bcl-2. Our data showed that NGF and AT2 receptor does not influence tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4).Figure 4Tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by NGF and Ang II. The cells were grown in serum-free medium for 12 h and stimulated with NGF (20 ng/ml) (A), Ang II (10−7m) (B), and NGF (20 ng/ml) plus Ang II (10−7m) (C). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with Bcl-2 antibody, resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the effect of MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide pretreatment on AT2 receptor-mediated DNA fragmentation (Fig.5 A and B). The most striking biochemical feature of apoptosis is the activation of endonuclease, which cleaves cellular DNA between regularly spaced nucleosomal units of 180 base pairs or multiples thereof that are readily detected as a DNA ladder by electrophoresis (16Horiuchi M. Yamada T. Hayashida W. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11952-11958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In MKP-1 sense oligonucleotide-treated cells, we observed that NGF inhibited apoptotic changes in PC12W cells after serum depletion and AT2 receptor antagonized the effect of NGF and induced apoptosis. We observed that MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide pretreatment blocked AT2 receptor-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5, A and B). As shown in Fig. 5 C, serum deprivation alone induces DNA fragmentation in MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotide treated cells. The highly abundant expression of AT2 receptor during embryonic and neonatal growth, the rapid disappearance after birth (19Grady E.F. Sechi L.A. Griffin C.A. Schambelan M. Kalinyak J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 20Tsutsumi K. Saavedra J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H667-H670PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tsutsumi K. Stromberg C. Viswanathan M.

Matsubara H. Murasawa S. Kanasaki M. Inada M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 46-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cardiac hypertrophy (23Lopez J. Lorell B.H. Ingelfinger J.R. Weinberg E.O. Schunkert H. Diamant D. Tang S.-H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 36: H844-H852Google Scholar), and skin wounds (24Viswanathan M. Saavedra J.M. Peptides ( Tarryt ). 1992; 13: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) suggest that this receptor is closely involved with growth, development, and/or differentiation. Indeed, we have demonstrated that the AT2 receptor mediates the developmentally regulated decrease in rat aortic DNA synthesis at late gestation, and we have also demonstrated, using in vivo gene transfer of the AT2 receptor cDNA into injured rat carotid artery, that overexpression of the AT2 receptor transgene results in an attenuation of neointimal hyperplasia (6Nakajima M. Hutchinson H. Fujinaga M. Hayashida W. Morishita R. Zhang L. Horiuchi M. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10663-10667Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Consistent with this in vivo observation, cultured vascular smooth muscle cells transfected with the AT2 receptor expression vector also exhibit decreased rates of DNA synthesis. Stollet al. (25Stoll M. Steckelings M. Paul M. Bottari S.P. Metzger R. Unger T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also report an antiproliferative influence of the AT2 receptor on cultured coronary endothelial cells. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the AT2 receptor induces apoptosis in cultured PC12W and in R3T3 cells (7Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 16Horiuchi M. Yamada T. Hayashida W. Dzau V.J. J. Biol.

Summerfelt R.M. Regul. Pept. 1993; 44: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These results support the notion that AT2 receptor plays an important role in fetal development and in the pathogenesis of some diseases in which apoptosis is involved. However, the molecular and cellular mechanism of AT2 receptor-mediated apoptosis has not been defined. MAP kinase mediates multiple cellular pathways. In neuronal cells, MAP kinase activity mediates the action of growth factors like epidermal growth factor, which stimulates cellular proliferation, as well as factors like NGF, which maintains neuronal survival and differentiation (28Chao M.V. Cell. 1992; 68: 995-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 29Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.-C. Filloux C. Peraldi P. Carpentier J.-L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Activation of the p42 and p44 isoforms of MAP kinase requires dual phosphorylation on Thr-183 and Tyr-185 residues (31Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the inactivation of MAP kinase is a critical event that regulates the physiological response for cell growth (18Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). This inactivation is mediated by dephosphorylation of Thr-183 and Tyr-185 residues by a “dual specificity” phosphatase known as MKP-1, which is encoded by the mitogen-inducible gene 3CH134 (18Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Recently, an isoform of MKP-1 was isolated from PC12W cells named MKP-2 (32Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Robertson M.S. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Cellular response to various stimuli may regulate MAP kinase activity by coordinating the action of the MAP kinase activation cascade (33Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and MKPs, resulting in the cell differentiation and survival or cell death. Using MKP-1 antisense strategy, we demonstrated that MKP-1 is involved in the inactivation of MAP kinase by the AT2 receptor. MKP-1 was discovered as an immediate early gene whose rapid transcription and subsequent translation have been suggested to provide a feedback loop to terminate growth factor signaling (18Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 33Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of activation of this phosphatase is not known. We previously reported that the dephosphorylation of MAP kinase was observed within 5 min after AT2 receptor stimulation in PC12W cells and that this effect was blocked by sodium vanadate and pertussis toxin (7Yamada T. Horiuchi M. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In contrast, Duff et al. (34Duff J.L. Marrero M.B. Paxton W.G. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Bernstein K.E. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26037-26040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that Ang II type 1 receptor stimulation rapidly induced MKP-1 mRNA (30 min maximum) in rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Therefore, we examined MKP-1 mRNA expression in PC12W cells after AT2 receptor stimulation and observed that AT2 receptor stimulation did not increase the MKP-1 mRNA in this cell line (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that AT2 receptor stimulation activates MKP-1 phosphatase activity without the apparent induction of MKP-1 expression. Apoptosis is controlled in part by a family of cytoplasmic proteins, the Bcl-2 family. Bcl-2 can prevent or delay apoptosis induced by a wide variety of stimuli and insults (9Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the Bcl-2 protein requires post-translational modification, specifically phosphorylation, to be functionally active (35Allsopp T. Wyatt S. Paterson H.F. Davies A.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 36Alnemri E.S. Robertson N.M. Fernandes T.F. Croce C.M. Litwack G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7295-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Recent data support the notion that phosphorylation of Bcl-2 is important for the regulation of Bcl-2 function and thereby apoptosis (10May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstromg D.K. Qatsha K.A.

In this study, we demonstrated that NGF enhanced the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and that the AT2 receptor inhibited the NGF-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation and induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that NGF-mediated MAP kinase activation is closely linked to increases in the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, resulting in the cell survival signal. MAP kinase is a serine/threonine kinase, and the minimal consensus sequence of substrate specificity of this kinase is the (Ser/Thr)-Pro (37Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Ser/Pro sequence, conserved in murine and human Bcl-2 at the positions 70 and 71 (38Negrini M. Silini E. Kozak C. Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 455-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 39Clearly M.L. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1992; 47: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Indeed, the phophorylation of the serine residue in Bcl-2 has been reported (10May W.S. Tyler P.G. Ito T. Armstromg D.K. Qatsha K.A. Davidson N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26865-26870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Halder S. Jena N. Groce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S.

These results suggest that MAP kinase phosphorylates the serine residue of Bcl-2. Moreover, we examined the possibility that MKP-1 could directly dephosphorylate the tyrosine residue of Bcl-2, since MKP-1 exerts tyrosine phosphatase activity (18Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). However, in PC12W cells, we did not observe any effect of NGF and AT2 receptor on tyrosine phophorylation of Bcl-2. We also observed that inhibition of MKP-1 expression blocked the AT2 receptor-mediated DNA fragmentation. Based on these results, we propose that MAP kinase plays a critical role in suppressing apoptosis in PC12W cells by phosphorylating and activating Bcl-2. The AT2 receptor inhibits MAP kinase activation by activating MKP-1 and subsequently dephosphorylates Bcl-2, resulting in the development of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1969081551,"The Holliday junction recombination intermediate, an X-shaped DNA molecule (xDNA), was analyzed at rDNA in mitotically growing yeast. In wild-type cells, xDNA is only detected at S phase, suggesting that recombination is stimulated to repair replication-related lesions. A search for mutations that increase the level of xDNA uncovered a gene encoding a subunit of DNA polymerase alpha. Systematic examination of replication mutants revealed that defects in polymerase alpha and delta but not the epsilon complex stimulate the level of xDNA. These xDNAs are Holliday junctions and not replication intermediates. The level of Holliday junctions is greatly reduced in rad52 mutants, but surprisingly, not in mutants defective in the three known mitotically expressed yeast RecA homologs."

The opening or closing of each end of the aqueous translocon pore is tightly controlled and occurs in a sequence that does not compromise the membrane's permeability barrier. Surprisingly, these structural changes at the membrane are effected by the transmembrane segment in the nascent protein from inside the ribosome. Thus, the ribosome, not the translocon, first recognizes the transmembrane segment and triggers long-range structural changes at the translocon that may be involved in shifting its function from translocation to integration."

All living organisms require copper for continued growth and development. Copper is an essential component of cell metabolism serving as a cofactor for numerous enzymes, such as cytochrome oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and dopamine-β-hydroxylase. Disruption of copper transport across the cell membrane causes a number of diseases, which differ in their severity, frequency, and susceptibility to treatment. Among them are Menkes disease, a neurodegenerative disease, caused by copper deficiency in a number of tissues (1Danks D.M. Scriever C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S.

Menkes and Wilson's disease genes were shown to encode very similar proteins (54% of their amino acid residues are identical) with significant homology to the cation-transporting P-type ATPases (4Vulpe C.

Analysis of their amino acid sequences also revealed that the WND and MNK proteins have distinctive structural features, suggesting unique mechanistic steps in the process of binding and translocation of copper (10Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The most striking and intriguing feature in the structure of both human copper-transporting ATPases is the presence of six repetitive sequences of approximately 70 amino acid residues at the N terminus of the molecule (Fig. 1). Each of these repeats contains a GMTCXXCXXXIE sequence motif, which was earlier found in the structure of mercury-binding proteins and in bacterial Cd-ATPase (11Nucifora G. Chu L. Misra T.K. Silver S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86: 3544-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 12Walsh C.T. Distefano M.D. Moore M.J. Shewchuk L.M. Verdine G.L.

This motif was immediately noted in the structural analysis of human copper-ATPases, and a role of the N terminus in the binding of heavy metals was proposed (4Vulpe C. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 5Tanzi R.E. Petrukhin K. Chernov I. Pellequer J.L. Wasco W. Ross B. Romano D.M. Parano E. Pavone L.

However, the involvement of the N-terminal domain in specific recognition of heavy metals and its precise role in the functioning of human copper-ATPase remain unknown. The stoichiometry of heavy-metal binding, the oxidation state of bound copper, and residues involved in heavy-metal coordination were also not characterized. Metal-binding repeats of the WND and MNK proteins belong to a continuous sequence of about 600 amino acid residues in the N-terminal portions of the WND and MNK molecules. This segment is separated from the “core,” ATPase, portion of the molecule (Fig. 1), and it seems plausible that these long characteristic sequences form independently folded domains. Such independently folded domains of proteins have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified, and their structural and functional properties have been successfully characterized in a number of cases (for an example, see Ref. 15Lappalainen P. Aasa R. Malmstrom B.G. Saraste M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26416-26421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the overexpression of the N-terminal domains of the Menkes and Wilson's disease proteins in soluble form and the purification and functional characterization of these domains. To create fusion proteins of the N-WND and N-MNK with the maltose-binding protein (MBP), segments corresponding to 64–1868 base pairs of the WND cDNA and 1–1836 base pairs of the MNK cDNA were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and then incorporated into pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs) at the 3′-end of coding sequence for the maltose-binding protein (MBP), after the factor Xa cleavage site. Stop codons were engineered at the 3′ end, and unique restriction sites (HindII at 5′ end and HindIII at 3′ end) were added to create a 5′ blunt end, 3′sticky end cloning fragment. Fragments were inserted between Asp700 and HindIII polylinker sites of pMal-c2. This procedure added an asparagine residue between the factor Xa cleavage site and the sequence of metal-binding domains in the final fusion product. Both N-WND and N-MNK inserts have been sequenced to ensure the lack of mutations. E. colicells BL21, bearing thioredoxin-containing plasmid (kindly provided by K. Zheleznova) were transformed with one of the two vectors (pMAL-c2/N-WND or pMAL-c2/N-MNK). Cells were grown at 37 °C and then induced with 1–2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature for 2–3 h. In some experiments, cells were grown either with or without 0.5 mm CuCl2 (this concentration of copper does not affect the rate of the cell growth). Distribution of the expressed fusion proteins between water-soluble and insoluble fractions was determined after cells were lysed with lysozyme as described (16Harris T.J. Patel T. Marston F.A. Little S. Emtage J.S. Opdenakker G. Volckaert G. Rombauts W. Billiau A. De Somer P. Mol. Biol. Med. 1986; 3: 279-292PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble proteins were separated from the insoluble portion by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, the pellet was resuspended in H2O in a volume equal to the volume of the supernatant, and the distribution of proteins between the two fractions was analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Only soluble proteins were used for further purification, which was carried out according to the New England Biolabs protocol. An amylose resin was equilibrated with sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (Na-P), and then incubated with proteins for 15 min at room temperature. The resin was washed with 5–10 volumes of Na-P buffer, and bound protein was eluted with 10 mm maltose in Na-P, pH 7.5. The eluted fusion proteins were concentrated if necessary by centrifugation through a Centricon 30 unit. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and by densitometry of the Coomassie-stained protein bands on the polyacrylamide gel. Bovine serum albumin (albumin standard from Pierce) has been used as a standard for both assays. For the measurements of stoichiometry of copper binding, an additional step of purification by gel-permeation high-performance liquid chromatography was carried out on the TSK-3000 SW column (TOYOHAAS), equilibrated with 50 mm Na-P and 150 mm NaCl. Purity of the protein was assessed by gel electrophoresis and confirmed by staining with a polyclonal antibody against synthetic peptide GMTCASCVHNIE. Isolation and purification of fusion proteins from cells grown in the presence of copper were identical to the purification procedure described above. The cation binding specificity of N-WND and N-MNK fusion proteins was determined by metal-chelate chromatography on iminodiacetic acid agarose (IAA-resin, Sigma) equilibrated with different heavy metals. IAA-resin was extensively washed with Na-P buffer, pH 7.5, and then equilibrated with 5–10 volumes of the same buffer containing chloride salts of different heavy metals at a final concentration of 1 mm. Excess heavy metals were removed by several washes with Na-P buffer, and then proteins in Na-P buffer were added to the resin (the experiments were done either by a centrifugation method or on mini-columns made from pipette tips). 10–15 μg of total protein in 100 μl of Na-P buffer were added to 25 μl of IAA-resin. Binding was allowed to proceed for 5–10 min at room temperature. Bound and unbound proteins were separated after a quick centrifugation step (5 min at 10,000 × g,minifuge, Fisher), and unbound protein was saved for further analysis. Resin then was washed with 200 μl of Na-P buffer, and bound protein was eluted with 100 μl of 10 mm EDTA in Na-P buffer. Both eluted and unbound fractions were concentrated by centrifugation in the SpeedVac centrifuge or using the Centricon 30 units. Proteins were separated by 10% Laemmli gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and intensities of the Coomassie-stained bands were compared by densitometry. The involvement of cysteine residues in coordination of copper was demonstrated by the ability of different heavy metals to protect cysteine residues in the metal-binding domains against labeling with the cysteine-directed fluorescent reagent 7-diethylamino-3- (4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM; Molecular Probes). For these experiments, purified N-WND and N-MNK proteins were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of different heavy metals (see legend for Fig. 7.) and then pulse-labeled with a 10–20 molar excess of CPM with respect to protein for 1 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were run on a 10% Laemmli gel. Differences in the fluorescence were monitored under UV light. The stoichiometry of copper binding and the oxidation state of bound copper were determined by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA)-based assay (19Brenner A.J. Harris E.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Protein-copper complexes were quickly disrupted by acid denaturation, and the released copper was detected with BCA as described (19Brenner A.J. Harris E.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of reducing reagents (1 mm ascorbate). BCA is highly sensitive and specific for Cu(I), which rapidly forms an intense purple complex with this reagent (e = 7.7 × 103 at 562 nm). If copper is present in solution in Cu(II) form, the reducing agent (1 mm ascorbate) has to be added to the incubation medium for copper-BCA complex to be formed. The lack of effect of ascorbic acid indicated that copper released from the protein was in the Cu(I) state. A difference in the absorbance of copper-BCA complex at 562 nm in the presence and absence of ascorbate points to the Cu(II) form of released cation. This procedure has been used to measure the in vivo andin vitro binding of copper to the domains. To determine the amount of copper incorporated into the fusion proteins in vivo, cells were grown in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm CuCl2. The N-MNK and N-WND were purified, and their copper content was determined with BCA (see above). To estimate the amount of copper bound to the protein in vitro,purified copper-free fusion proteins at a concentration of 0.1–0.2 mg/ml were mixed with CuCl2 (at approximate molar ratio of 20 μmol of copper per 1 μmol of protein) in the presence or absence of freshly prepared 1 mm ascorbate. After 10–15 min incubation at room temperature, unbound copper was removed by overnight dialysis at 4 °C, and bound copper was measured with BCA in the presence of 1 mm ascorbate. Our initial attempt to express N-WND and N-MNK proteins in E. coli led to the accumulation of protein in inclusion bodies under all experimental conditions we tested. To overcome this problem and to obtain proteins in a water-soluble and functional form, we used a new approach, which was reported to produce a dramatic increase in solubility of eucaryotic proteins produced inE. coli (20Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25328-25331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This approach requires cotransformation ofE. coli cells with two plasmids: one containing the coding sequence for the protein of interest, and the other is a thioredoxin-encoding plasmid. The expression of high levels of thioredoxin seems to change the red/ox potential of E. colicells, mimicking the environment in eucaryotic cells; this in turn facilitates proper folding of eucaryotic proteins and increases their solubility (20Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25328-25331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We were successful in using this system for both N-WND and N-MNK metal-binding domains, and after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, we observed a significant level of expression of both fusion proteins (Fig.2 A). Analysis of the distribution of the expressed protein between water-soluble and insoluble fractions demonstrated that about 40–60% of the fusion proteins were in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2 B). We also determined that the presence of 0.5 mm CuCl2 in the growth medium did not affect the level of expression or solubility of either fusion proteins (Fig. 2). Proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on amylose column, yielding about 1–2 mg of purified proteins from 1 liter of cell culture. To determine cation-binding specificity of the purified N-WND and N-MNK domains, we used metal-chelate chromatography on IAA, equilibrated with different heavy metals (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Our preliminary experiments showed that MBP does not bind to any of the metal-chelate columns we tested; thus, we used the entire fusion proteins for these experiments. Both N-WND and N-MNK fusion proteins display high selectivity toward copper-equilibrated resin, as shown in Fig. 3. No binding was observed for cadmium- and cobalt-equilibrated columns, and no protein was bound to heavy metal-free resin or to the resin equilibrated with manganese (Fig. 3). Minor binding to the zinc-equilibrated resin was seen for both N-WND and N-MNK. These experiments indicated that purified N-MNK and N-WND proteins specifically bind copper in vitro, when copper is added to these proteins in a partially chelated Cu(II) form. In cells, however, copper will likely be presented to the N-WND and N-MNK domains in a reduced form. To test whether the N-terminal domains of human copper-ATPases can bind copper under reducing conditions, we compared the incorporation of copper into the N-WND and N-MNK domains in the presence and absence of a reducing agent. The purified N-MNK and N-WND-proteins were incubated with the 20 molar excess of CuCl2 in the presence and absence of 1 mmascorbate. The unbound copper was removed by overnight dialysis, and copper bound to the proteins was measured using the BCA-based assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Our data demonstrate that both N-WND and N-MNK not only bind Cu(I) but that there is, in fact, an increase in the level of incorporation of copper into both domains when reducing reagent is present (Fig. 4). To confirm that the N-MNK and N-WND proteins bind copper in vivo, we grew E. coli cells and induced expression of the proteins in medium containing 0.5 mm copper. The N-MNK and N-WND fusions were isolated from these and control (no copper present in the growth medium) cells, and the amount of copper bound to the proteins was determined using the BCA-based assay. Fig. 5 illustrates that the N-MNK and N-WND proteins obtained from copper-treated cells did bind this heavy metal, whereas no copper binding was observed for control proteins. The stoichiometry of copper binding to the N-WND and the N-MNK domains was calculated in three independent experiments and was shown to be 5.75 ± 0.15 μmol of copper per μmol of protein for the N-WND domain and 5.39 ± 0.26 μmol of copper per μmol of protein for the N-MNK domain (Fig. 5). Copper-containing N-WND and N-MNK proteins do not absorb in the 600–800 nm wavelength range typical for Cu(II)-protein complexes (21Speno H. Taheri M.R. Sieburth D. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), even when copper was added in the form of CuCl2 (data not shown). This suggested that the oxidation state of copper was changed upon binding. To confirm this hypothesis, we used BCA. BCA is highly sensitive and specific for Cu(I), which rapidly forms an intense purple complex with this reagent (19Brenner A.J. Harris E.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The presence of reducing agents, such as ascorbic acid, is required for a similar complex to be formed with Cu(II) (Fig. 6). Thus, we purified the N-MNK and the N-WND domains, which have copper incorporated in vivo, and compared the amount of BCA-copper complex formed following protein denaturation in the presence and absence of 1 mm ascorbic acid. Fig. 6 illustrates that the amount of copper-BCA complex was not significantly affected by the presence of the reducing agent. This result indicates that copper bound to the N-WND and N-MNK proteins was already in the reduced Cu(I) form. In these experiments, we observed, however, a difference between the rate of the BCA-copper complex formation for the N-WND and N-MNK domains. Copper released from the N-MNK domain formed a complex with BCA rapidly, with or without reducing agent present. In the same experiments, copper released from the WND domain quickly formed the BCA-copper complex in the presence of ascorbic acid, whereas without ascorbate, longer incubation times were required for the same complex to be formed. (Long incubation of control Cu(II) solution with BCA did not lead to the formation of the copper-BCA complex, which still required the presence of the ascorbate.) Each putative metal-binding repeat in the N-WND and N-MNK proteins contains two invariant cysteine residues, which are obvious candidates for interactions with heavy metals. To examine whether cysteine residues play a role in heavy-metal binding and to confirm the selectivity of the domain toward copper, we compared the ability of different heavy metals to protect cysteine residues in the “metal-binding motifs” against labeling with the cysteine-directed fluorescent CPM; the idea was that cysteine residues involved in coordination of a heavy metal would be less reactive toward the CPM. (MBP does not have cysteine residues in its sequence). Fig.7 shows that incubation of the N-WND domain with copper indeed prevents labeling of cysteines residues with fluorescent probe, whereas the presence of cadmium was without effect on labeling, in agreement with the results obtained with metal-chelate chromatography. The identical results were obtained for the N-MNK-domain (data not shown). Involvement of Cys residues in coordination of copper, which was incorporated into the N-terminal domains in vivo, has also been tested. CPM labeling of N-WND and N-MNK, purified from control cells and cells grown in the presence of copper, was compared. As shown in Fig. 8, copper-free N-WND and N-MNK were readily modified with the cysteine-directed probe, whereas almost no labeling was seen in the copper-bound proteins. Thus, binding of copper to the N-WND and N-MNK domains in vitro and in vivosignificantly decreases the availability of the Cys residues for modification with the Cys-directed probe, indicating that cysteines are probably directly involved in the coordination of copper. Here we report functional characterization of the purified N-terminal domains of the Wilson's and Menkes disease proteins. We demonstrate that both N-MNK and N-WND readily and selectively bind copper in vivo and in vitro. This is based on a series of experiments, including direct measurements of copper incorporated in vivo, and results of metal-chelate chromatography for the purified proteins and fluorescent labeling of the cysteines in the presence of different heavy metals. Each of the six metal-binding repeats in the N terminus of the copper-ATPases appears to coordinate copper, which binds to both N-WND and N-MNK in its reduced form. Both N-MNK and N-WND show high selectivity toward copper. This property is in agreement with the proposed physiological role for the Menkes and Wilson's disease proteins as copper-specific ion pumps. Our initial studies of heavy-metal specificity of the N-MNK and N-WND proteins, which were carried out following denaturation and refolding of the expressed N-WND and N-MNK, also demonstrated selectivity toward copper. However, refolded N-WND and N-MNK proteins showed significantly less discrimination between different heavy metals, because they were bound equally well to the zinc and copper-chelate columns (22Lutsenko, S., Petrukhin, K., Gilliam, T. C., and Kaplan, J. H. (1997)Annu. Rev. Acad. Sci., N. Y. in press.Google Scholar). These data point to the important role of the well-preserved three-dimensional structure of the domains for selectivity toward copper. It is quite possible that the large number of heavy metal-binding repeats in the N-terminal portion of human copper-transporting ATPases and their unique spatial arrangement are required to provide high selectivity toward copper. Our data indicate that there are 5–6 copper molecules bound per N-terminal domain molecule, suggesting that each of the sequence repeats is likely to be involved in copper binding. The stoichiometry of copper incorporation was reproduced in three independent experiments; however, binding of 6 copper ions per domain should be considered as an approximate stoichiometry until confirmed by other methods. The precise number of copper atoms bound per domain will be determined in future crystallization studies. The obtained stoichiometries reflect the amount of tightly bound copper because our experimental conditions include multiple washes or long dialysis. The binding we observed must be of a rather high affinity because the presence of 1 mm EDTA in the buffer during purification of the copper-containing N-WND and N-MNK did not decrease the stoichiometry of copper binding. These data also indicate that in the native enzyme, additional sites may exist for exchangeable copper (conserved CPC motif in the membrane portion is the obvious candidate for such a site), or else interactions of the N-terminal domain with other domains in the copper-ATPase during the cycle allow copper to be released from the N-terminal domain and then be transported. In any case, direct involvement of the N-terminal domains in copper binding suggests that they play an important role in copper-dependent functions of the Wilson's and Menkes disease proteins. Future experiments with the full-length copper-ATPase will show whether the cations that are bound to the N-terminal domains are then transported by human copper-ATPases. We have also demonstrated that the presence of reducing agents facilitates copper binding to the domains and that copper is likely to be bound to the N-MNK and N-WND domains in the Cu(I) form. The N-MNK domain incorporates a similar amount of copper in vitro andin vivo, whereas differences between in vivo andin vitro stoichiometry were observed for N-WND. The lower copper binding by purified copper-free N-WND can be explained by partial nonspecific formation of the S-S bridges in N-WND during overexpression and purification. This explanation also agrees with lesser labeling of cysteines in N-WND compared to N-MNK (Fig. 8). In fact, completely reduced and refolded N-WND binds about 5.5–6 μmol of copper per μmol of protein (our observation). Further experiments, including EPR studies, are under way to confirm our conclusion about the oxidation state of copper in the N-WND and N-MNK complexes. We also found that N-MNK and in particular N-WND have a “hot spot” for proteolytic digestion. As shown in Fig. 8, the 65-kDa fragment is a major, and often the only, contaminant in our preparation. Western blot analysis with the antibodies directed either against MBP or against the N terminus and copurification of the 65-kDa protein and full-length domain on amylose column and on metal-chelate column indicate that the 65-kDa fragment contains both parts (MBP and two or three repeats of N-WND). We speculate that folded N-WND and N-MNK are composed of two subdomains connected by a flexible and proteolytically sensitive linker. Finally, we have demonstrated that Cys residues in metal-binding motifs seem to be directly involved in copper coordination. Most probably, these cysteines are not the only amino acid residues that interact with copper. Experiments are currently under way to identify other participating residues."

A temperature-sensitive S. pombe mis6-302 frequently loses a minichromosome at 26°C and abolishes equal segregation of regular chromosomes at 36°C. The mis6+ gene is essential for viability, and its deletion results in missegregation identical to mis6-302. Mis6 acts before or at the onset of S phase, and mitotic missegregation defects are produced only after the passage of G1/S at 36°C. Mis6 locates at the centromeres throughout the cell cycle. In the mutant, positioning of the centromeres becomes abnormal, and specialized chromatin in the inner centromeres, which give the smear micrococcal nuclease pattern in wild type, is disrupted. The ability to establish correct biorientation of sister centromeres in metaphase cells requires the Mis6-containing chromatin and originates during the passage of G1/S."

Moran O. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 18: 127-171Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). VDACs play a role in the regulated flux of metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane, but their exact cellular role is not well understood. VDACs from a variety of organisms have remarkably similar electrophysiological properties (1Sorgato M. Moran O. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 18: 127-171Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Gating of the channel depends upon the transmembrane potential, while its voltage sensitivity is modulated by an intermembrane protein (2Liu M.Y. Colombini M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). VDACs are “open” at low transmembrane potentials, with a preference for anions such as phosphate, chloride, and adenine nucleotides. At higher transmembrane potentials, VDACs are in a “closed” configuration and more selective for cations (2Liu M.Y. Colombini M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 3Mannella C. Forte M. Colombini M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). VDACs have been shown to reversibly bind several cytosolic kinases, including glycerol kinase and the hexokinase isoforms I–IV (reviewed in Ref. 4Adams V. Griffin L. Towbin J. Gelb B. Worley K. McCabe E. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1991; 45: 271-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).

It has been suggested that this complex has properties resembling the permeability transition pore (9Beutner G. Ruck A. Riede B. Welte W. Brdiczka D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). A direct demonstration of voltage-gated ATP flux through VDAC was recently reported (10Rostovtseva T. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28006-28008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Physiological concentrations of NADH also affect VDAC permeability, suggesting one possible mechanism for the observed ability of glycolysis to suppress oxidative phosphorylation (the Crabtree effect; Refs. 11Zizi M.

We have previously described the isolation of mouse orthologues for VDAC1 and VDAC2, as well as a novel mouse VDAC termed VDAC3 (17Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 33: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Davison D.B. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Each isoform is 65–70% identical to the other isoforms. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that VDAC3 is the more primordial of the vertebrate VDAC genes, suggesting that if the multiple isoforms arose from a gene duplication and divergence event VDAC3 diverged from the primordial VDAC first, with VDAC1 and VDAC2 arising more recently (18Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Davison D.B. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The three mouse genes have been mapped to separate autosomal loci (17Sampson M.J.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether the genomic organization can be correlated with existing structural information about the VDAC protein, and whether the VDAC isoforms arose by gene duplication and divergence or evolutionary convergence, we have characterized the gene structure for each VDAC locus. In addition, we have examined the promoter regions of each VDAC gene by DNA sequence analysis and expression studies to discern any regulatory similarities. Furthermore, to begin to examine the functional properties of VDAC3, the cDNA was expressed in a VDAC-deficient yeast strain and tested for its ability to complement the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of a VDAC-deficient yeast. To generate isoform-specific probes, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the 3′-untranslated region of each mouse VDAC isoform (from nucleotides 959–1277 for VDAC1, 942–1276 for VDAC2, and 1022–1428 for VDAC3 (17Sampson M.J.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Each PCR product was used to generate [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) random primer-labeled probes. The three probes were used to screen a 129/sv λFixII genomic library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridizations were carried out in Blotto (1.5 × SSPE, 1% SDS, 0.5% nonfat dried milk) at 65 °C. Purified phage were isolated by three rounds of sequential purification, and restriction mapping was performed using standard methods. Genomic fragments that hybridized to the full-length cDNAs were subcloned into pBluescript KS vectors using established protocols. The fragments were sequenced using Universal and Reverse primers on an Applied Biosystems model 373A automated fluorescent DNA sequencer. When necessary, complementary oligonucleotides were used to complete the sequencing of all VDAC exons. When the genomic clone did not contain the entire genomic structure of the VDAC isoform, a 5′ intronic fragment from the genomic clone was used to screen the genomic library as before. The new genomic clone isolated was then hybridized with both cDNA and 5′-RACE probes until the entire genomic structure of each isoform was characterized. Nucleotide sequence analysis was performed using the GCG software package (51). Total RNA was extracted using guanidinium isothiocyanate from mouse tissues as described (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). The RNA was used in the 3′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) system (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. For VDAC1, PCR amplification of the first-strand cDNA was performed using two sense nested primers (5′-CTAGCCTGATTGGCTTAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTCGATGGCAAGAAC-3′, respectively). For VDAC2, two sense nested primers were also used to amplify the 3′-RACE product from first-strand cDNA (5′-CATTGCAGCTAAATACCA-3′ and 5′-GGTACCAACTGCACTCGTTTTG-3′, respectively). The amplified PCR products were subcloned into a plasmid T-vector (20Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar) and sequenced. Total RNA was extracted using guanidinium isothiocyanate from embryonic stem (ES) cells as described above. RNA (∼20 μg/lane) was fractionated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Life Science). To prevent probe cross-hybridization the membranes were probed with the 3′-untranslated regions of each VDAC isoform labeled as before. Hybridizations were carried out overnight at 65 °C in Blotto. The membranes were washed twice in 2 × standard saline citrate, 0.1% SDS for 10 min and exposed for 16–24 h at −80 °C. Ten micrograms of genomic DNA from the species listed in Fig. 2 were digested with EcoRI, separated by electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel, and Southern-blotted onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Life Science). Each full-length VDAC cDNA was labeled as before and used to probe the blot. Hybridization was carried out in Blotto at 55 °C overnight. After hybridization the filter was washed several times in 3 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 37 °C and set to expose for several days. The blot was stripped after each hybridization by washing in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) reporter plasmid constructs of the 5′-flanking region of each mouse VDAC isoform were prepared by standard cloning techniques. The VDAC1 5′-flanking 918-base pair (bp) fragment was generated by PCR using a sense oligonucleotide upstream of the first exon and an antisense oligonucleotide from the 5′-untranslated region (5′-GCTTGATATCGAATTCTCCTCG-3′ and 5′-GGGAGCAGCGGCAGCTAC-3′, respectively; 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles). The PCR product was subcloned into a plasmid T-vector (20Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar), and the restriction enzymes XbaI andAccI were used to subclone the DNA in both orientations in the pCAT Basic and Enhancer vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) using adapter oligonucleotides. The same strategy was used to subclone a smaller 513-bp VDAC1 5′-flanking fragment using a different upstream sense oligonucleotide (5′-GCCGCTCTGACCTATACAGC-3′) and the same 5′-untranslated antisense oligonucleotide. A VDAC2 1014-bpEcoRI/PvuII fragment was isolated from a genomic phage clone and subcloned into pKS. The restriction enzymesXbaI and SalI were used to subclone the DNA in both orientations in the pCAT Basic vector using adapter oligonucleotides. A 4-kilobase pair (kb) upstream EcoRI VDAC2 fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the 1014-bp DNA in the correct orientation, and also inserted into the pCAT Basic vector as before. Since the most 5′ VDAC3 genomic clone isolated only contained an additional 529 bp of upstream genomic sequence, a 549-bp XbaI/TaqI fragment was subcloned into pKS, and the restriction enzymes XbaI and AccI were used to subclone the DNA in both orientations in the pCAT Basic and Enhancer vectors using adapter oligonucleotides. The pCAT Basic vector, which lacks a promoter and enhancer, and the pCAT Enhancer vector, which lacks a promoter, were used as negative controls, while the pCAT Control vector containing both the promoter and enhancer of simian virus 40 (SV40) was used as a positive control. DNA was prepared using a Qiagen plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/60 mm plate. The following day, transfections were carried out using 1 μg of CAT construct DNA, 8 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.2 μg of the β-galactosidase expression vector pCMVβ (Promega, Madison, WI) in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell extracts (20 μl) were heated for 10 min at 65 °C and assayed for CAT activity, as described by Sambrooket al. (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.56-16.62Google Scholar). CAT assay results were quantified using a Betascope Betascanner (IntelliGenetics, Cambridge, MA). CAT activities are expressed as a percentage of the pCAT control. For each of the three VDAC isoforms oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to createNcoI sites at the start codon for both VDAC1 and VDAC2, and an AflIII site for VDAC3. The same strategy was used to generate NsiI sites in the 3′-untranslated region of each gene. This allowed for the complete open reading frame of each VDAC cDNA to precisely replace the yeast VDAC gene previously cloned into a yeast single-copy shuttle vector (kindly provided by M. Forte, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR; Ref. 22Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides for each gene were used to amplify the cDNA inserts, the products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, and the fragments were subcloned to replace the yeast VDAC gene between the NcoI and NsiI sites. From the starting ATG codon, the length of each cDNA insert was 1111 bp for VDAC1, 1079 bp for VDAC2, and 1014 bp for VDAC3. The three constructs were then introduced into the VDAC-deficient yeast strain M22–2 by lithium acetate transformation (23Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). The yeast were streaked onto media containing 2% glycerol as the sole carbon source and incubated at 30 °C or 37 °C for 6 days. The importance of VDAC proteins for normal metabolic homeostasis was recently emphasized by the report of a child with a mitochondrial myopathy who was shown by Western analysis to have a partial deficiency of VDAC1 protein (24Huizung M. Ruitenbeek W. Thinnes F. DiPinto V. Pediatr. Res. 1996; 39: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The disorder appeared to be somewhat tissue-specific, with a greater deficiency of VDAC1 in skeletal muscle than fibroblasts. The patient's skeletal muscle mitochondria also exhibited reduced rates of pyruvate oxidation and ATP production. Since VDACs are expressed in nearly all tissues and have been shown to bind various kinases in liver, fat, and brain tissues and in several tumor cell lines, a global role for VDACs in metabolic homeostasis has been suggested (4Adams V. Griffin L. Towbin J. Gelb B. Worley K. McCabe E. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1991; 45: 271-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, despite the extensive electrophysiological characterization of the VDAC channels from numerous organisms, the functional roles of the VDAC isoforms in metabolic homeostasis are not well understood. To begin to understand the genetic basis for VDAC function we have determined the structural and regulatory regions of the murine genes encoding the three VDAC isoforms. The VDAC1 gene spans approximately 28 kb, and is made up of 9 exons (Fig. 2). The predicted start codon is located 4 bp into the second exon. Sequencing of the first 5′-untranslated exon of VDAC1 identified 41 bp of cDNA sequence previously obtained by 5′-RACE (17Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 33: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Since high promoter activity is detected in the region immediately 5′ to this sequence, transcription initiation is predicted to occur at or close to this sequence. In addition to the spliced functional gene, a total of five distinct VDAC1 processed pseudogenes, each without an open reading frame, were isolated and sequenced from the genomic library (data not shown). The VDAC2 gene, unlike VDAC1 or VDAC3, is encoded by 10 exons, with the additional exon constituting part of the 5′-untranslated region. VDAC2 spans approximately 12 kb, with the 132-bp 5′-untranslated region (17Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 33: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) encoded in the first two exons. The predicted start codon of VDAC2 is located 26 bp into the second exon. A single VDAC2 processed pseudogene lacking an open reading frame was also isolated (data not shown). The VDAC3 gene is encoded by 9 exons and spans approximately 16 kb. The predicted start codon is found 3 bp into the second exon, and the first and second exons contain the entire 78 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence predicted by 5′-RACE (18Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Davison D.B. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A single VDAC3 processed pseudogene lacking an open reading frame was isolated, as well as an intronless VDAC3-like sequence with a complete open reading frame (data not shown; GenBank™U89990). This sequence differs from the VDAC3 cDNA sequence at only eight nucleotide positions, five of which are in the predicted coding region, leading to three silent codon changes and two amino acid substitutions; a glycine to glutamic acid substitution and tryptophan to glycine substitution. Despite the presence of an open reading frame, the lack of conserved amino acid substitutions suggests it is a processed pseudogene under no evolutionary selection. The exon/intron junctions were sequenced for each gene, and the size of all introns was determined by DNA sequencing, restriction site mapping, and/or PCR amplification (Table I). All exon/intron splice junctions follow the GT-AG rule and conform to the established consensus exon boundary sequences (48Shapiro M. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). The VDAC exons generally correspond to the transmembrane regions proposed for the human VDAC protein structure (Fig. 1; Ref. 25De Pinto V. Palmieri F. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It may be argued that the introduction of introns into the VDAC gene defines a modular organization to the different transmembrane regions of the VDAC protein, however it may also simply be a chance occurrence. The genomic conservation of all coding exon/intron boundaries is indicative of a gene family, and strongly suggests gene duplications and divergence as the origin of the three VDAC isoforms. The 5′-untranslated region exon/intron boundaries and the intron sizes are not conserved, suggesting the gene duplications were ancient evolutionary events that followed the introduction of introns, and that these sequences may have evolved a new function after the duplication of the genes, or alternatively are under no functional constraints. The splice acceptor boundaries of the third exon of VDAC2 and the second exon of VDAC3 are conserved. In VDAC3 the site is located within the 5′-untranslated sequence, while in VDAC2 it is located in the coding region. This demonstrates a single instance of coding and non-coding splice site conservation between the VDAC isoforms. The same boundary site in the 5′-untranslated region of the VDAC1 gene differs by a single nucleotide (Table I).Table IA comparison of VDAC exon/intron organizationExonSize3′ splice site (acceptor)5′ splice site (donor)IntronIntron typeInterrupted amino acidbpkbMVDAC1 141TCCGAGgtaggcgca14.1 270gttgtggaagAACATG…GCTACGgtgagtgtc0.5491Gly 350ccttctttagGCTTTG…GGATTGgtaagtctc1.4280 4153ctcctttaagGAATTT…GACCAGgtaagagct0.1040 553ttatttgcagCTTGCT…CACTGGgtaaggttc7.22Gly 6228ttccctttagGAAAAA…TAATGTgtaagtgta1.92Val 7151ttactcacagGAATGA…TTTTCGgtgggtacc1.50 858ctccccacagGCCAAA…AACCAGgtatgtgtt0.91Gly 9966ctccccacagGTATCAMVDAC2 1132CCGCAGgtactatggt0.183 259cctttcacagATCACC…CACGGCgtaagtagca0.91Pro 369ttttgactagCGATGT…GATTTGgtaaggactt0.871Gly 450ctttttgaagGCTTTG…GGTGTGgtaagttatt3.80 5153gtcttgttagGAATTT…GACCAGgtagcgtttc0.0940 653tctgaaatagATATGT…CACAGGgtaagtgctg0.3472Gly 7228ctttttccagAAAGAA…AAATGTgtaagtccct1.72Val 8151tatcttatagAAATAA…ATCTCTgtgagtacct3.20 958ctctttctagGCAAAG…GGCCTGgtaagtatct1.21Gly 10733ttgttcacagGTGTGAMVDAC3 178…TTGTAGgtgagacgac4.8 269cattttcaagCTATGT…GGTATGgtaagtacac1.21Gly 350atgtttctagGGTTTG…GGAGTGgtgagtacct3.80 4153tgtttatcagGAATTT…AATAAGgtaagaaaaa1.450 553tgtttcacagTTGGCT…CACAGGgtaattatcc2.02Gly 6228gtttttacagAAAGAA…TCACGTgtgagtgttc1.52Val 7151atgagaacagGAATGA…CTATCTgtaagaatgt0.90 858ttaatcttagGCCAAA…GACCAGgtacgtaaag0.441Gly 9508ttctccttagGAGTCAExon and intron sequences are shown in upper- and lowercase letters, respectively.

Intron sizes were either measured by direct sequencing, restriction site mapping, and/or PCR amplification. The size of the first 5′-untranslated exon given is the length of sequence confirmed by either 5′-RACE or cDNA sequencing. The human VDAC1 gene was reported to contain 854 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence with a consensus polyadenylation site (16Blachly-Dyson E. Zambrowicz E.B. Yu W.H. Adams V. McCabe E.R.B. Adelman J. Colombini M. Forte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1835-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the original mouse VDAC1 cDNA did not contain a consensus polyadenylation site (17Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 33: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), 3′-RACE was used to identify the polyadenylation site(s). Using this technique, a 873-bp 3′-untranslated region was sequenced, and, in contrast to the human VDAC1 gene, two consensus polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) at nucleotides 1737 and 1748 were identified. The latter signal is most likely the primary polyadenylation signal used, both because of its proximity to the poly(A) tract and because the signal at nucleotide 1737 is not conserved in the human 3′-untranslated sequence. The mouse VDAC1 3′-untranslated region has approximately 70% DNA sequence conservation with the human VDAC1 cDNA. This region is 20 bp longer than the human VDAC1 3′-untranslated sequence, but the high degree of sequence similarity between the two regions further supports that these genes are orthologues. Blachly-Dyson et al. (16Blachly-Dyson E. Zambrowicz E.B. Yu W.H. Adams V. McCabe E.R.B. Adelman J. Colombini M. Forte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1835-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested the existence of alternative polyadenylation sites in the human VDAC2 gene based upon finding two sets of human cDNA clones with differing 3′-untranslated sequence lengths. Four of the human cDNA clones terminated at a position equivalent to nucleotide 1301 in the mouse VDAC2 gene. The mouse VDAC2 gene was previously shown to be encoded by multiple transcripts, based on Northern blot analysis (Ref. 17Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 33: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; Fig.2). 3′-RACE was used to determine if the multiple VDAC2 transcripts are due to alternative polyadenylation signals. Three distinct PCR products were generated by 3′-RACE (data not shown), each of which was subcloned and sequenced. The 3′-untranslated region of VDAC2 contains one aberrant and two canonical polyadenylation signals. The two longer products can be accounted for by consensus polyadenylation signals found at nucleotides 1462 and 1637, respectively. The shortest product, corresponding to the strongest signal on a Northern blot of ES cell RNA (Fig. 2), terminates in a 4-bp region from nucleotides 1300 to 1303, with no consensus polyadenylation signal present. This 4-bp region is completely conserved in the human VDAC2 3′-untranslated region. Less than 5% of mRNAs are generated by non-consensus polyadenylation signals (26Birnstiel M.L. Schaufele F.J. Birnstiel M.L. Structure and Function of Major and Minor Small Ribonucleoprotein Particles. Springer-Verlag, New York1988: 155-182Google Scholar), although the most proximal alternative polyadenylation signal used by the mouse and human VDAC2 genes is not apparent. The lack of a consensus polyadenylation signal in VDAC2 may cause the termination site of the short transcript to be less precise, thus accounting for the 4-bp region of termination identified by 3′-RACE. 3′-Untranslated regions have been shown to control mRNA turnover, translation efficiency, and the subcellular location of transcripts (27De Sauvage F. Kruys V. Marinx O. Huez G. Octave J.N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3099-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Kislauskis E.H. Li Z. Singer R.H. Taneja K.L. J.

Brewer G. Bernstein P. Hart P.A. Ross J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1991; 1: 99-126PubMed Google Scholar); it is possible that the shorter 3′-untranslated region plays a specific role in regulating VDAC2 gene expression during development. Ha et al. (31Ha H. Hajek P. Bedwell D.M. Burrows P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12143-12149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has suggested the existence of two alternative VDAC2 amino termini in humans based upon the isolation of variant cDNAs. The possibility that the mouse VDAC2 gene also generates alternative amino termini has not been exhaustively addressed, although no alternative VDAC2 cDNAs were identified in the course of these studies. The VDAC3 transcript has previously been shown to terminate at a single polyadenylation site (18Sampson M.J. Lovell R.S. Davison D.B. Craigen W.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The evolutionary conservation o"

Salmonella cells shifted to higher temperatures, such as those encountered at host entry, showed derepressed tlpA activity. tlpA::lacZ fusions indicated that the promoter itself is insensitive to thermal shifts and that transcription control was exerted by the autorepressor TlpA only. In vitro studies with highly purified TlpA showed concentration and temperature dependence for both fully folded conformation and function, indicating that the thermosensing in TlpA is based on monomer-to-coiled-coil equilibrium."

The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori is the causative agent of active chronic gastritis (1Solnik J.V. Tompkins L.S. Inf. Agents Dis. 1993; 1: 294-309Google Scholar, 2Dixon, M. F. (1994) Scand. J.

A prominent feature in H. pylori-induced gastritis is infiltration of the gastric lamina propria by neutrophil granulocytes, and neutrophils are also seen permeating between the epithelial cells (8Rauws, E.

The neutrophil-activating protein induces an increased expression of CD11b/CD18 on neutrophils and promotes the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells. By polymerase chain reaction amplification, the gene for the neutrophil-activating protein was found in all H. pylori isolates tested. Since the activation of human neutrophils might involve lectin-carbohydrate interactions, the binding of radiolabeled neutrophil-activating protein of H. pylori to glycosphingolipids from human neutrophils was investigated using solid phase assays. A selective binding of the neutrophil-activating protein to four compounds in the acid glycosphingolipid fraction of human neutrophils was detected. In addition, the protein bound to sulfatide and sulfated gangliotetraosyl ceramide. Comparison of the binding preferences of the protein to reference glycosphingolipids from other sources suggested that the neutrophil-activating protein of H. pylori preferentially recognizes glycoconjugates with a terminal linear NeuAcα3 Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ(4GlcNAcβ) 1The glycosphingolipid nomenclature follows the recommendations by the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN for Lipids, Eur.

Neutrophil leukocytes were isolated from pooled outdated human blood from healthy donors (blood group A) by Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) centrifugation as described by Bøyum (20Bøyum A. Tissue Antigens. 1974; 4: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), with minor modifications (21Fredlund H. Olcén P. Danielsson D. APMIS. 1988; 96: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Acid and non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions were isolated by the reported method (22Karlsson K.-A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Briefly, the material was lyophilized and then extracted in two steps in a Soxhlet apparatus with chloroform and methanol (2:1 and 1:9, by volume). The extract was subsequently subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis and dialysis, and nonpolar lipids were removed by silicic acid column chromatography. Acid and non-acid glycosphingolipids were separated on a DEAE-cellulose column. The non-acid fraction was acetylated (23Handa S. Jpn. J. Exp. Med. 1963; 33: 347-360PubMed Google Scholar), separated from alkali-stable phospholipids on a second silicic acid column, and then deacetylated. From 1.6 × 1010 cells of pooled neutrophils, 24.4 mg of acid glycosphingolipids (1.5 × 10−9 mg/cell) and 41.2 mg of non-acid glycosphingolipids (2.6 × 10−9mg/cell) were obtained. Polyglycosyl ceramides were isolated as described (24Miller-Podraza H. Andersson C. Karlsson K.-A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1168: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, the residue from extraction with chloroform and methanol was acetylated and then extracted with chloroform. The extract was filtered, and the residue was washed with water. The material in the chloroform phase was purified by Sephadex LH-20 and Sephadex LH-60 (Pharmacia) chromatography. The main carbohydrate-containing fraction was deacetylated and, after dialysis, suspended in 2-propanol/hexane/water (55:25:20, by volume) and centrifuged. Thus, the polyglycosyl ceramides were obtained in the supernatant, and the yield was approximately 0.3 mg/g of dry weight. Acid and non-acid glycosphingolipid fractions were obtained from the sources given in the legend to Fig. 1 and in Table I by standard procedures (22Karlsson K.-A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The individual glycosphingolipids were isolated by repeated chromatography of the native glycosphingolipid fractions or their acetylated derivatives on silicic acid columns. The identity of the purified glycosphingolipids was confirmed by mass spectrometry (25Samuelsson B.E. Pimlott W. Karlsson K.-A.

Expression of the tryptophan-inducible thioredoxin HPNAP fusion protein and its recovery in lysozyme EDTA whole cell lysates were done using the ThioFusion Expression System (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA 92121). The fused protein was purified by the same method as described for the native neutrophil-activating protein of H. pylori (17Evans Jr., D.J. Evans D.G. Takemura T. Nakano H. Lampert H.C. Graham D.Y. Granger D.N. Kvietys P.R. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal thioredoxin did not diminish the biological activity of the neutrophil-activating protein, as determined using the nitro blue tetrazolium dye reduction assay (17Evans Jr., D.J. Evans D.G. Takemura T. Nakano H. Lampert H.C. Graham D.Y. Granger D.N. Kvietys P.R. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was concentrated to 1 mg/ml on a Filtron 10K Microsep membrane (Filtron Scandinavia AB, Bjärred, Sweden). Aliquots of 100 μl were labeled with 125I by the Iodogen method (33Aggarwal B.B. Eessalu T.E. Hass P.E. Nature. 1985; 318: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), yielding on average 5 × 103 cpm/μg. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on glass- or aluminum-backed silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) using chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, by volume) as the solvent system. For separation of gangliosides, a solvent system composed of chloroform/methanol/water with 0.25% KCl (50:40:9, by volume) was used, and chloroform/methanol/water with 0.2% CaCl2 (50:55:19, by volume) was utilized for separation of polyglycosyl ceramides. Chemical detection was done with anisaldehyde (34Waldi D. Stahl E. Dünnschicht-Chromatographie. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1962: 496-515Google Scholar) or the resorcinol reagent (35Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1963; 10: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Binding of radiolabeled recombinant neutrophil-activating protein from H. pylori to glycosphingolipids separated on thin-layer plates was done as described previously for the binding of bacteria (36Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.-A. Larson G. Strömberg N. Thurin J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mixtures of glycosphingolipids (20–40 μg/lane) or pure compounds (1–4 μg/lane) were separated on aluminum-backed silica gel 60 PHTLC plates. After drying, the chromatography plates were treated with 0.5% (w/v) polyisobutylmethacrylate (Plexigum P28, Röhm, GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) in diethyl ether for 1 min. The plates were then soaked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3, containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (w/v) NaN3 (Solution 1) for 2 h at room temperature. A suspension of 125I-labeled protein (diluted in Solution 1 to approximately 2 × 103 cpm/μl) was sprinkled over the plates, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature and then washed six times with PBS. Autoradiography was performed for 6–24 h using XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen. The microtiter well binding assay was performed as described previously (37Karlsson K.-A. Strömberg N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In short, serial dilutions (each dilution in triplicate) of pure glycosphingolipids in methanol were applied in microtiter wells (Cooks M24, Nutacon, Holland). When the solvent had evaporated, the wells were blocked for 2 h with 200 μl of Solution 1. Then 50 μl of radiolabeled neutrophil-activating protein diluted in Solution 1 (approximately 2 × 103 cpm/μl) was added per well and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. After washing six times with Solution 1, the wells were cut out, and the radioactivity was counted in a gamma counter. Human erythrocytes (blood group ARh+ and ORh+) were washed three times with 0.9% NaCl (w/v) and suspended in PBS to 3% (by volume). The erythrocyte suspension (25 μl) was added to serial dilutions (in PBS) of the neutrophil-activating protein from H. pylori in microtiter wells (50 μl/well, starting at 1 mg/ml), and the resulting dilutions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature then visually inspected (38Rüdiger H. Gabius H.-J. Gabius S. Lectins and Glycobiology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1993: 31-46Crossref Google Scholar). As a control, the hemagglutination of the lectin from Erythrina cristagalli(39Iglesias J.L. Lis H. Sharon N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was tested in parallel. Radiolabeled HPNAP was incubated with separated glycosphingolipids on thin-layer chromatography plates, and bound protein was visualized by autoradiography. A distinct binding to four bands in the acid glycosphingolipid fraction isolated from human granulocytes was detected (Fig. 1, lane 1). The binding-active compounds migrated below sialylneolactotetraosyl ceramide. Desialylation of the acid glycosphingolipids from human neutrophils abolished the binding of the neutrophil-activating protein (Fig. 2, lane 6). No binding of the protein to the non-acid glycosphingolipid fraction (Fig. 2, lane 4) or polyglycosyl ceramides (not shown) from human granulocytes was obtained. The amount of acid glycosphingolipids obtained from pooled granulocytes from healthy donors was judged to be too low to permit an isolation of the binding-active gangliosides. Therefore, a number of reference glycosphingolipids of known structure was utilized in chromatogram binding assays in an attempt to circumstantially identify the structures of the compounds responsible for binding of the neutrophil-activating protein. The results are summarized in TableI. The protein bound to sulfatide (Table I, 1; Fig. 1,lane 5) and sulfated gangliotetraosyl ceramide (Table I, 9) with a detection level at 1 μg and also to neolactotetraosyl ceramide (Table I, 6), gangliotetraosyl ceramide (Table I, 7) and fucosyl-gangliotetraosyl ceramide (Table I, 8). The binding to the latter three compounds was, however, sporadic, and the detection level was 4 μg. Several of the gangliosides tested were consistently nonbinding. Thus, no binding to GM3 (Table I, 10), GM1 (Table I, 11), GD1a (Table I, 12), NeuAc/NeuGcα3neolactotetraosyl ceramide (Table I, 13 and 15), NeuAcα6neolactotetraosyl ceramide (Table I, 14), sialyllactotetraosyl ceramide (Table I, 16), NeuAcα3Lea hexaglycosyl ceramide (Table, 17), or disialylneolactotetraosyl ceramide (Table, 18), was detected. However, a consistent binding to the gangliosides NeuGcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer (Table I, 20; Fig. 1, lane 8) and NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer (Table I, 21; Fig. 3, lanes 3 and4) was obtained, with a detection level at 1 μg. De-sialylation of these two gangliosides (Table I, 26) abolished the binding (not shown). NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer (Table I, 22) was also bound by the neutrophil-activating protein (not shown). However, the related gangliosides, NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ6(NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3)Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer (Table I, 23; Fig. 3, lane 5), Fucα2Galβ4GlcNAcβ6(NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3)Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer (Table I, 24), and Galα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ6(NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3)Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer (Table I, 25), having branches at the 6 position of the terminal Gal of a neolactotetraosyl ceramide core structure, were nonbinding. To further define the binding specificities and compare the relative binding affinities, the binding of radiolabeled HPNAP to selected glycosphingolipids was evaluated in the quantitative microtiter well assay. As shown in Fig.4 A, the protein bound to NeuGcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer with half-maximal binding occurring at 2 ng/well. Binding to SO3-Galβ3GalNAcβ4Galβ4Glcβ1Cer and sulfatide (Fig. 4 B) was also obtained, with halfmaximal binding occurring at 2 and 30 ng/well, respectively. Serial dilutions of HPNAP in microtiter wells were tested for ability to agglutinate human erythrocytes. However, no agglutination was obtained, even at the highest protein concentration used (1 mg/ml). The lectin from E. cristagalli, used as a control, caused hemagglutination at approximately 10 μg/ml. The gangliosides from human neutrophils, the target cells ofH. pylori neutrophil-activating protein, are a complex mixture. The main components are the GM3 ganglioside and sialylneolactotetraosyl ceramide. The larger gangliosides are based on repetitive N-acetyllactosamine units and in many cases carry Fucα residues linked to the 3 position of GlcNAc. In addition, NeuAc may be α3- or α6-linked to the terminal Gal of neolactotetraosyl ceramide and the longer glycosphingolipids with repetitiveN-acetyllactosamine units (18Fukuda M.N. Dell A.

This distribution of the fatty acids makes each glycosphingolipid appear as a double band on thin-layer chromatograms. In the present study, four bands with HPNAP-binding activity were detected in the acid fraction of human neutrophils. When a number of reference gangliosides from other sources were tested for binding activity, most of them were nonbinding. However, HPNAP bound distinctly to NeuAc- and NeuGcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer, which comigrated with the uppermost binding-active double band in the acid fraction of human neutrophils (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4), and to NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer, which migrated in the region of the lower binding-active double band (not shown). NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer and NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer have also been identified in human neutrophils (18Fukuda M.N. Dell A. Oates J.E. Wu P. Klock J.C. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1067-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stroud M.R. Handa K. Salyan M.E.K. Ito K. Levery S.B. Hakomori S. Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). When the terminal sialic acid of NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer was removed, the binding of HPNAP was abrogated. In addition, NeuAcα3neolactotetraosyl ceramide (Table I, 13) was nonbinding. Taken together, this indicates that NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ, or possibly NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ, is minimally required for binding of the neutrophil-activating protein. A further notation is that HPNAP bound to both NeuAc- and NeuGcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer and thus accepted the presence of an acetyl group (-NHCOCH3) as well as an N-glycolyl group (–NHCOCH2OH) at C-5 of the terminal sialic acid. However, N-glycolylneuraminic acid has not been found in normal human tissues (41Higashi H. Hirabayashi Y. Fukui Y. Naiki M. Matsumoto M. Ueda S. Kato S. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 3796-3802PubMed Google Scholar). From the results of this study, it cannot be excluded that HPNAP also recognized NeuAcα6Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer. However, there is conflicting evidence about the presence of this glycosphingolipid in human neutrophils. Although previously reported as one of the human neutrophil gangliosides (18Fukuda M.N. Dell A. Oates J.E. Wu P. Klock J.C. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1067-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this compound was not found in the recent thorough study of gangliosides of human neutrophils (19Stroud M.R. Handa K. Salyan M.E.K. Ito K. Levery S.B. Hakomori S. Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 758-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 40Stroud M.R. Handa K. Salyan M.E.K. Ito K. Levery S.B. Hakomori S. Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). NeuAcα6Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer is present in human erythrocytes (42Watanabe K. Powell M.E. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8223-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this compound was, unfortunately, not available in pure form. A large number of monosialoganglioside fractions from human erythrocytes were, however, tested for binding of the neutrophil-activating protein, but the only binding-active compounds detected were NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer and NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer. No binding of HPNAP to human neutrophil polyglycosyl ceramides was obtained. When using the extraction procedures of this study, the more complex gangliosides are mainly found in the polyglycosyl ceramide fraction. In human neutrophils, these complex gangliosides have a poly-N-acetyllactosamine core structure with terminal NeuAcα3 and α3-linked Fuc at one or several of the internal GlcNAc residues (19Stroud M.R. Handa K. Salyan M.E.K. Ito K. Levery S.B. Hakomori S. Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 758-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 40Stroud M.R. Handa K. Salyan M.E.K. Ito K. Levery S.B. Hakomori S. Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The absence of binding to these compounds indicates that the α3-linked fucose residues interferes with the binding process. The non-binding of NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ6(NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3)Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer is probably due to steric hindrance imposed by the β6-linked branches. This could have implications for the interaction of the protein with glycoproteins and polyglycosyl ceramides. Although the NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ sequence is often present in the carbohydrate chains of these glycoconjugates, it is mainly found on multiply branched structures and thus may be nonbinding. This suggestion was supported by the observed inability of HPNAP to cause agglutination of human erythrocytes. HPNAP consists of 10 15-kDa subunits and thus is multimeric. Still, no agglutination of human erythrocytes was obtained, indicating that the N-linked polylactosamine chains of band 3 of adult human erythrocytes having terminal NeuAcα3 but with β6-linked N-acetyllactosamine units at internal Gal residues, Galβ4GlcNAcβ6(NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3)Galβ4GlcNAcβ3 (43Fukuda M.

The binding-active NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer and NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glcβ1Cer are also present in human erythrocytes (42Watanabe K. Powell M.E.

However, the density of these minor gangliosides may not be enough to induce hemagglutination. No binding activity was detected in the total acid fraction of human erythrocytes as shown in Fig. 1, lane 2and Fig. 3, lane 1. HPNAP also bound to sulfatide and SO3-Galβ3-GalNAcβ4Galβ4Glcβ1Cer. If this binding is a true recognition process or due to complementary ionic interactions remains to be investigated. However, since sulfated glycosphingolipids have not been convincingly identified in human neutrophils, the biological implications of this binding property are, at present, elusive. The results from this study do not exclude the possibility that HPNAP interacts with some granulocyte glycoproteins. However, when proteins from human neutrophils were extracted (45Yang Z. Bergström J. Karlsson K.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14620-14624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and binding of H. pylori neutrophil-activating protein was tested on blotting membranes, no specific binding was obtained (data not reproduced). Still, most of the reported oligosaccharides of human neutrophil glycoproteins also have repetitive N-acetyllactosamine cores (46Fukuda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 780: 119-150PubMed Google Scholar). However, the majority of these glycoproteins have terminal NeuAcα6, and the internal GlcNAc residues are substituted with Fucα3. The concluded binding-active NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ (4GlcNAcβ) sequence has, however, been proposed to exist in unsubstituted form in some glycoproteins of human neutrophils, as e.g. leukosialin (47Fukuda M. Carlsson S.R. Klock J.C. Dell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 261: 12796-12806Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which H. pyloricolonization of the gastric epithelium leads to diseases of the stomach and duodenum are largely unknown. The pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced gastroduodenal diseases is likely to be a complex process, and no single event or phenomenon may be solely responsible for all its clinical manifestations. The major known virulence factors of the bacterium are the urease (48Dunn B.E. Campbell G.P. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9464-9469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Lee A. Fox J. Hazell S. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the VacA cytotoxin (50Cover T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The newly identified neutrophil-activating protein is likely to be involved in the early stages of the disease process, as in gastritis, which is characterized by an abundant accumulation of neutrophils in the superficial gastric mucosa. In this study, a HPNAP-binding carbohydrate sequence present in human neutrophils was identified by utilizing reference glycosphingolipids from other sources than the target cells. Current studies aim to isolate the binding-active glycosphingolipids from human neutrophils to conclusively establish their structures and obtain more information on the binding epitope. Inhibition studies have now been initiated, and preliminary results indicate that the phagocytosis of the neutrophil-activating protein by preactivated human neutrophils may be partly inhibited by synthetic carbohydrate analogues of the proposed binding-active sequence. 3D.

https://openalex.org/W2169547107,"We recently have shown that activated Ras, but not Raf, causes transformation of intestinal (RIE-1, IEC-6) epithelial cells, whereas both activated Ras and Raf transform NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Oldham, S. M., Clark, G. J., Gangarosa, L. M., Coffey, R. J., and Der, C. J. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 6924–6928). The observations that conditioned medium from Ras-, but not Raf-, transfected RIE-1 cells, as well as exogenous transforming growth factor α (TGFα), promoted morphological transformation of parental RIE-1 cells prompted us to identify epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) ligands produced by Ras-transformed RIE-1 cells responsible for this autocrine effect. Since studies in fibroblasts have shown that v-Src is transforming, we also determined if v-Src could transform RIE-1 cells. H- or K-Ras-transformed cells secreted significant amounts of TGFα protein, and mRNA transcripts for TGFα, amphiregulin (AR), and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) were induced. Like Ras, v-Src caused morphological and growth transformation of parental RIE-1 cells. However, TGFα protein was not secreted by RIE-1 cells stably expressing v-Src or activated Raf, and only minor increases in EGFR ligand mRNA expression were detected in these cells. A selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD153035 attenuated the Ras-, but not Src-, transformed phenotype. Taken together, these observations provide a mechanistic and biochemical basis for the ability of activated Ras, but not activated Raf, to cause transformation of RIE-1 cells. Finally, we suggest that an EGFR-dependent mechanism is necessary for Ras, but not Src, transformation of these intestinal epithelial cells. We recently have shown that activated Ras, but not Raf, causes transformation of intestinal (RIE-1, IEC-6) epithelial cells, whereas both activated Ras and Raf transform NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Oldham, S.

Finally, we suggest that an EGFR-dependent mechanism is necessary for Ras, but not Src, transformation of these intestinal epithelial cells. A remarkable convergence of biological, biochemical and genetic evidence has established that Ras proteins mediate many of their actions via recruitment of Raf-1 to the cell surface, which allows this serine/threonine kinase then to become activated. Raf-1 causes activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase; TGFα, transforming growth factor-α; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor; AR, amphiregulin; BTC, betacellulin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RIA, radioimmunoassay. kinase (MEK), which in turn phosphorylates p42 and p44 MAPKs. These two MAPKs then translocate to the nucleus where they activate the Elk-1 transcription factor. The ability of dominant negative mutants of Raf-1, MEK, and MAPKs to block oncogenic Ras transformation of rodent fibroblasts demonstrates the essential role of this kinase cascade in Ras function (1Kolch W.

However, recent studies also support the importance of Raf-independent effector pathways in mediating Ras transformation (4Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 5White M.A. Nicholette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Van Aelst L. Karin M. Wigler M.H.

Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although mutated ras genes are most frequently associated with human tumors of epithelial origin (7Clark G.J. Der C.J. Dickey B.F. Birnbaumer L. GTPases in Biology I. Springer Verlag, Berlin1993: 259-288Google Scholar, 8Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar), most of our knowledge on the signaling pathways that mediate oncogenic Ras function is based on studies of rodent fibroblasts. Therefore, we have been interested in examining transformation by oncogenes such as ras,raf, and src in epithelial cell systems. We have observed that activated Ras, but not Raf, causes transformation of the rat intestinal epithelial cell line RIE-1, as determined by altered morphology, growth in soft agar, and rapid appearance of tumors in nude mice (9Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of the Raf/MEK/MAPK cascade alone was not sufficient to cause transformation. Furthermore, our observation that Ras-, but not Raf-, expressing cells secreted factors that promoted RIE-1 morphological transformation suggested that Ras transformation of these epithelial cells was mediated, at least in part, via an autocrine mechanism. Previous studies in other systems have found increased expression of transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) associated with Ras transformation (10Buick R.N. Filmus J. Quaroni A. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 170: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Ciardello F. McGeady M.L. Kim N. Basolo F. Hynes N. Langton B.C. Yokozaki H. Saeki T. Elliott J.W. Masui H. Mendelsohn J.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1883-1893PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have evaluated the role of EGF receptor (EGFR) ligands in mediating Ras transformation of RIE-1 cells. We observed that Ras-, but not Raf-, expressing cells exhibited increased expression and secretion of TGFα protein. In contrast, Src transformation did not cause up-regulation of TGFα production. Furthermore, inhibition of EGFR function impaired the morphological and growth characteristics of Ras-, but not Src-, transformed cells. These observations distinguish the activities of Ras versus Raf and suggest that Ras transformation is mediated by a Raf-independent, EGFR-dependent mechanism. Transformation by v-Src, however, is not dependent on an EGFR autocrine mechanism. RIE-1 cells were obtained from Dr. Kenneth Brown (Cambridge, UK) and are a diploid, nontransformed, EGF-responsive cell line derived from rat small intestine (13Blay J. Brown K.D. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1984; 8: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Blay J. Brown K.D. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). All assays were done before passage 30. The EGFR kinase inhibitor PD153035 was obtained from Parke-Davis (15Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMicheal A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J.

The pZIP-K-ras(12V) and pZIP-Δraf22W retrovirus expression vector constructs, which encode transforming mutants of human K-Ras 4B and Raf, respectively, have been described (9Oldham S.M. Clark G.J.

The pSV2-H-ras (12V) expression vector construct contains the genomic human sequences encoding the transforming H-Ras(12V) protein and was provided by Dr. Jorge Filmus (Sunnybrook Health/Science Ctr., Toronto, Canada) (17Buick R.N. Filmus J. Quaroni A. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 170: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The psrc construct encodes viral Src and was a gift from Dr. Mark Kamps (VCSD, San Diego, CA) (18Kamps M.P. Buss J.E. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4625-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The constructs pZIP-K-ras(12V), pZIP-Δraf22W, and psrc with pZIP-NeoSV(x)1, as well as the pZIP-NeoSV(x)1 vector control, were each transfected into the RIE-1 cells (1–3 μg of plasmid DNA/60-mm dish). Transfections were done using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 16–20 h on cells seeded at 1–5 × 105/60-mm dish. Transfected cells were selected and maintained in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Multiple G418-resistant colonies (>50) were pooled together for further studies. The pSV2-H-ras (12V) as well as the pSV2neo vector control were each transfected into the RIE-1 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (19Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected in medium containing 500 μg/ml of G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and subcloned by limiting dilution. Parental RIE-1 cells and each of the transfected RIE-1 lines were grown to confluence in 24-well dishes, washed in isotonic buffer twice, and switched to serum-free DMEM (1 ml/well) for 48 h, at which time media and lysates were harvested. The cells were washed twice with isotonic buffer and then lysed at room temperature in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (1 ml/well) on a rocker for 1 h. The rat TGFα antibody used for the RIA was developed in collaboration with East Acres Biologicals (Southbridge, MA). The RIA has been described previously in detail (20Russell W.E. Dempsey P.J. Sitaric S. Peck A.J. Coffey R.J. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1731-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and was used to measure TGFα in both the conditioned media and lysates of each transfected cell line. Representative wells were trypsinized, and the cells were counted with a hemacytometer to normalize the data. These experiments were performed on cell lines prior to passage 11. Cells were grown to near confluence, washed twice with isotonic buffer, and then switched to serum-free DMEM for 72 h. Then total cellular RNA was extracted by the method of Schwab et al. (21Schwab M.K. Alitalo H.E. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1983; 303: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Oligo(dT)-selected RNA was separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels, and Northern blotting was performed as described previously (22Dobner P.R. Kawaski E.S. Yu L.Y.

PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) was performed to quantify band intensities. Parental, H-Ras, K-Ras, and v-Src RIE-1 cells were plated in 6-well cluster plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well. Cells were counted 24 h later to determine plating efficiency. Cells were then treated with the indicated concentrations of PD153035 (10 nm, 25 nm, and 50 nm) or Me2SO (1 μl/ml). Cells were treated every other day (days 2 and 4), and triplicate wells were counted by hemacytometer on days 3 and 6. 1–20 × 103cells/ml of each cell line (H-ras-, K-ras-, or v-src-transfected RIE-1 cells) were plated in 0.4% SeaPlaque agarose (FMC Corp. BioProducts) over a hardened layer of 0.8% agarose. Growth medium containing Me2SO alone or PD153035 (dissolved in Me2SO) was added prior to plating. After 7–10 days, colonies in triplicate (>50 μm) were counted with a colony counter (Bausch & Lomb). Paired t test was used to test for significant differences compared with control. Morphological reversion experiments were performed by adding 1 μm PD153035 or Me2SO in growth medium to ∼50% confluent ras-and v-src-transfected RIE-1 cells growing in 6-well dishes. Morphological changes were monitored over the next 72 h and photographs were taken. Conditioned media experiments were performed by harvesting 48-h serum-free conditioned medium from the Ras-transformed and control cell lines. The conditioned media were then filtered through a 0.2 micron filter and added to 50% confluent parental RIE-1 cells at a 3:1 ratio with fresh serum-free medium alone or with 1 μm PD153035 or 3 μl/ml anti-TGFα antibody S-574. The cells were examined for morphological changes over the next 48 h and photographed. Parental and H-Ras RIE-1 cells were plated in 24-well cluster dishes at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and allowed to grow to 70–80% confluence. Cells were then treated for 24 h with 1 μm PD153035 or Me2SO followed by a 5-min pulse with TGFα (10 ng/ml) where indicated. Cells were then lysed with buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 500 μm Na3VO4, 50 μmPMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Samples of equal protein concentrations were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The Western blot was probed with anti-human EGFR sheep polyclonal (Upstate Biotechnology) and detected with a donkey anti-sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) followed by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Life Science Inc.) and autoradiography. The phosphorylated tyrosine content of the receptor was determined by subsequently probing the Western blot with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine, clone 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology), followed by ECL chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Life Science Inc.) and autoradiography. We recently have reported that constitutively activated Ras, but not Raf, caused transformation of RIE-1 cells and that Ras-conditioned medium morphologically transformed parental RIE-1 cells (9Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Since studies in fibroblasts have demonstrated that v-Src causes transformation, we examined whether RIE-1 cells were also transformed by v-Src. A line of RIE-1 cells was generated with a v-src construct. We initially compared the morphological appearance of the parental RIE-1 cells (Fig. 1 A) with that of those transfected with pSV2-H-ras(12V) (Fig. 1 D), pZIP-K-ras(12V) (Fig. 1 E), and psrc(Fig. 1 F). RIE-1 cells stably expressing oncogenic H-Ras, K-Ras, and v-Src showed morphological alterations from a flat monolayer of cuboidal cells to spindle-shaped cells with a poorly adherent, highly refractile subpopulation. The H-Ras- and v-Src-expressing RIE-1 cells, like the recently described K-Ras-expressing RIE-1 cells (9Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), also grew in soft agar and formed tumors rapidly in nude mice (data not shown). The RIE-1 cells transfected with pZIP-Δraf22W (Fig. 1 C), the pSV2neo vector (Fig. 1 B), and the pZIP-Neo SV(x)1 vector (data not shown) appeared identical in morphology to parental cells. Thus, in contrast to activated Raf, v-Src caused a fully transformed phenotype that was similar to that caused by activated Ras. Studies then were directed toward identification of factors that contribute to the morphological changes induced by Ras-conditioned medium. Since administration of TGFα to parental RIE-1 cells led to morphological alterations similar to Ras-conditioned medium (9Oldham S.M. Clark G.J. Gangarosa L.M. Coffey R.J. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6924-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we initially examined TGFα protein production by Ras-transformed cells and compared the results withraf- and src-transfected cells. RIE-1 cells transfected with activated H-ras and K-rassecreted ∼3–6 ng of TGFα/106 cells/48 h into conditioned media, and ∼500–1000 pg of TGFα/106 cells were measured in cell lysates (Fig. 2). Neither the parental RIE-1 cells nor the cells transfected with activatedraf, v-src, or control vectors had detectable TGFα in their conditioned media (Fig. 2). Less than 100 pg of TGFα/106 cells was detected in cell lysates of pZIPneo-,raf-, and v-src-transfected RIE-1 cells. Thus, production of TGFα clearly distinguishes Ras- from Raf-expressing RIE-1 cells. Furthermore, v-Src-mediated transformation was not associated with increased TGFα protein levels, and thus, production of TGFα is not required for RIE-1 cellular transformation. Administration of a neutralizing TGFα antibody to Ras-conditioned medium was able to partially revert morphological transformation of parental RIE-1 cells (Fig. 6 C) although it was able to completely block the effects of exogenous TGFα (data not shown), suggesting that additional factors participate in Ras morphological transformation.Figure 6Effects of TGFα antibody neutralization and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition on morphological alterations of parental RIE-1 cells induced by Ras-conditioned medium.Conditioned medium from vector control or K-ras-transfected RIE-1 cells alone or together with either anti-TGFα antibody (1:250) or PD153035 (1 μm) was added to parental RIE-1 cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” Photographs were taken 48 h later.

Graves-Deal R. Pittelkow M.R. DuBois R.N. Cook P. Ramsey G.W. Bishop P.R. Damstrup L. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22817-22822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and up-regulation of several EGFR ligands has been observed in keratinocytes infected with v-H-ras (12Dlugosz A.A. Cheng C. Williams E.K. Darwiche N. Dempsey P.J. Mann B. Dunn A.R. Coffey R.J. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1883-1893PubMed Google Scholar). Inasmuch as reliable protein assays are not available for AR and HB-EGF, we examined expression of mammalian EGFR ligands by Northern blot analysis. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from near confluent cultures of each cell line maintained serum-free for 72 h. Primary data are shown in Fig. 3 A and phosphoimager quantification of band intensities are depicted in Fig. 3 B. Results are expressed as -fold increase over appropriate neo control, after normalization to the constitutively expressed 1B15 mRNA of each lane. The only transcript detected in parental RIE-1 cells and RIE-1 cells transfected with vector controls was HB-EGF. RIE-1 cells transfected with H-ras and K-ras constructs exhibited a greater than 10-fold induction of signals for AR and TGFα and a 2–3-fold increase in HB-EGF mRNA expression. In contrast to Ras-transformed cells, raf- and v-src-transfected cells had less than a 2-fold increase in AR and HB-EGF expression. A TGFα transcript was observed in v-Src-transformed cells although no TGFα protein was detected as noted above. Transcripts for EGF and BTC were not seen in any of the cell lines. Thus, selective overexpression of TGFα, AR, and HB-EGF distinguishes Ras RIE-1 cells from both nontransformed Raf and transformed v-Src RIE-1 cells. PD153035 has been demonstrated to be a highly specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (15Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. McMicheal A. Ambroso L.A. Nelson J.M. Leopold W.R. Connors R.W. Bridges A.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The ability of this compound to block EGFR function in RIE-1 cells is shown in Fig.4. Pretreatment with PD153035 (1 μm) blocked TGFα-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in serum-starved parental RIE-1 cells (Fig. 4). This agent was then used to determine the contribution of up-regulated EGFR ligands to the Ras-transformed phenotype under four experimental conditions. First, PD153035 (1 μm) reduced basal EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in H-Ras-transformed RIE-1 cells (Fig. 4). Based on the previous data, we suggest that this enhanced basal EGFR phosphorylation is likely due to increased levels of endogenous EGF-like ligands activating the EGFR in Ras-transformed cells. Second, addition of 1 μm PD153035 to RIE-1 cells expressing activated K-Ras caused morphological reversion to a more normal appearance within 72 h (Fig.5). Third, addition of the compound to conditioned medium from K-Ras-transformed cells prevented morphological transformation of parental RIE-1 cells caused by K-Ras-conditioned medium alone (Fig. 6). Finally, PD153035 caused a dose-dependent reduction in the ability of H- and K-Ras-transformed RIE-1 cells to proliferate on plastic (Fig.7). We observed, however, that PD153035 treatment of Src-transformed cells failed to cause any significant morphological reversion (Fig. 5) and did not inhibit the monolayer growth of these Src-transformed cells or parental RIE-1 cells (Fig. 7). This agent also significantly reduced soft agar growth of H- and K-Ras-, but not v-Src-, transformed RIE-1 cells (data not shown). Thus signaling through the EGFR contributes significantly to Ras transformation of RIE-1 cells, but Src transformation does not appear dependent on this pathway.Figure 5Effects of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition on morphological appearance of K-Ras- and v-Src-transformed RIE-1 cells.

Herein, we have shown that there is up-regulation of EGFR ligand expression in activated ras-, but not raf-, transfected RIE-1 cells and that autocrine growth factor signaling through the EGFR contributes significantly to the Ras-transformed phenotype. Additional recent support for the importance of EGFR signaling in mediating the Ras-transformed phenotype comes from studies using EGFR “knock-out” keratinocytes infected with H-ras retroviral constructs. As compared with H-ras-infected, wild-type keratinocytes, H-ras-infected EGFR −/− cells form smaller tumors in a primary engrafted papilloma model. 2A. A. Dlugosz, R. J. Coffey, and S. H. Yuspa, unpublished observations. The failure of Raf-expressing cells to cause induction of EGFR ligand expression suggests that Ras activates a Raf-independent pathway that promotes EGFR ligand expression. Studies are underway to identify the Ras signaling pathway that is responsible for EGFR ligand overexpression. These studies do not delineate the role of individual EGFR ligands in contributing to the Ras-transformed phenotype. Filmus et al.(28Filmus J. Shi W. Spencer T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1017-1022PubMed Google Scholar) studied H-ras transformation of an immature rat epithelial crypt cell line (IEC-18) and also found TGFα mRNA induction and increased protein production. Soft agar growth of the H-ras-transfected IEC-18 cells was attenuated with both TGFα neutralizing antibodies and anti-sense TGFα construct transfection although transfection of IEC-18 cells with TGFα was not sufficient to transform these cells. Expression of other EGFR ligands was not examined in this study. The observation that EGFR blockade (via pharmacological inactivation of its tyrosine kinase (Fig.6 D)), but not neutralization of TGFα (via antibody neutralization (Fig. 6 C)), is able to fully revert morphological alterations induced by Ras-conditioned medium suggests that secreted AR and HB-EGF contribute to this effect. It is possible that TGFα along with AR and/or HB-EGF act in concert to mediate morphological transformation of RIE-1 cells. Future studies will address whether overexpression of AR or HB-EGF may be sufficient to transform RIE-1 cells or whether a combination of EGFR ligands is necessary. v-Src transformation of RIE-1 cells appears to be mediated by a mechanism distinct from that of Ras. In contrast to events related to Ras transformation of RIE-1 cells, v-Src cells do not highly express EGFR ligand transcripts nor produce TGFα protein, and administration of a specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor did not lead to morphological reversion or a decrease in growth of these Src-transformed cells. Collectively, these data indicate that Src transformation of RIE-1 cells occurs independently of EGFR-mediated events. Thus, whereas Src transformation of rodent fibroblasts is dependent on Ras function, a similar requirement may not be involved in Src transformation of RIE-1 cells. Ras-independent Src signaling events have been observed recently (29Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 30D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Whether Ras activation is required for Src transformation awaits future analyses. These results in intestinal epithelial cells underscore the potentially important distinct pathways and mechanisms underlying oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells and fibroblasts. This is not unanticipated in view of marked differences in the growth regulation of these two cell types. For example, platelet-derived growth factor is a mitogen for fibroblasts, but epithelial cells are nonresponsive due to their lack of platelet-derived growth factor receptors. TGFβ stimulates growth of fibroblasts, whereas it is a potent epithelial cell growth inhibitor. Moreover, half-lives of farnesylated Ras proteins markedly differ between fibroblasts and epithelial cells in the presence of farnesyltransferase inhibitors. 3A. D. Cox, R. J. Coffey, and C. J. Der, unpublished observations. Finally, activatedras and raf constructs transform NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, whereas only the former is able to transform intestinal and mammary epithelial cells (6Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). An important lesson from these studies is that one cannot necessarily extrapolate results from growth regulation and oncogene transformation of fibroblasts to epithelial cell systems.

Bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1) also plays key roles in regulating vertebrate matrix deposition; it is the procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) that processes procollagen types I–III, and it may also mediate biosynthetic processing of lysyl oxidase and laminin 5. Here we show that BMP-1 is itself up-regulated by TGF-β1 and that secreted BMP-1, induced by TGF-β1, is either processed to an active form or remains as unprocessed proenzyme, in a cell type-dependent manner. In MG-63 osteosacrcoma cells, TGF-β1 elevated levels of BMP-1 mRNA ∼7-fold and elevated levels of mRNA for mammalian tolloid (mTld), an alternatively spliced product of the BMP1 gene, to a lesser extent. Induction of RNA was dose- and time-dependent and cycloheximide-inhibitable. Secreted BMP-1 and mTld, induced by TGF-β1 in MG-63 and other fibrogenic cell cultures, were predominantly in forms in which proregions had been removed to yield activated enzyme. TGF-β1 treatment also induced procollagen N-proteinase activity in fibrogenic cultures, while expression of the procollagen C-proteinase enhancer (PCPE), a glycoprotein that stimulates PCP activity, was unaffected.

Thus, it was suggested that BMP-1, by structure an astacin-like protease, may function in morphogenesis by activating TGF-β-like molecules (1Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3324) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, BMP-1 has a domain structure similar to, but shorter than, that of tolloid, a Drosophila protein that appears to act in patterning of embryos by potentiating the activity of decapentaplegic, a TGF-β family member (2Childs S.B. O'Connor M.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 3Finelli A.L. Bossie C.A. Xie T. Padgett R.W. Development. 1994; 120: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian BMP1 gene is now known to produce alternatively spliced mRNAs for BMP-1 and for a longer protein, mammalian tolloid (mTld), which has a domain structure identical to that of Drosophilatolloid (4Takahara K.

Greenspan, unpublished observations. Demonstration of PCP activity, however, does not preclude the possibility that BMP-1 and/or mTld may also activate TGF-β-like proteins. In fact, it is becoming increasingly apparent that products of the BMP1 gene play multiple roles in matrix deposition. These include proteolytic activation by fibrogenic cells of lysyl oxidase (11Panchenko M.V. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Trubetskoy O.V. Gacheru S.N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7113-7119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), an enzyme necessary to formation of covalent cross-links in fibrillar collagens and elastin, and biosynthetic processing by keratinocytes of laminin 5 (12Amano, S., Takahara, K., Gerecke, D., Nishiyama, T., Lee, S., Greenspan, D. S., and Burgeson, R. E. (1996) Mol. Biol. Cell, 7, Suppl., 58a (Abstr. 338).Google Scholar), a major basement membrane component of skin. PCP activity of BMP-1 is stimulated ∼10-fold by the procollagen C-proteinase enhancer (PCPE), a glycoprotein that binds the type I procollagen C-propeptide (10Kessler E. Adar R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, possible involvement of PCPE in other biological activities of BMP-1 and mTld has not been examined.TGF-β1, prototype of the TGF-β superfamily, induces net increases in the deposition of insoluble matrix by cells. This is accomplished by effecting decreased production of proteases that degrade matrix and increased production of (i) inhibitors for such proteases, (ii) structural matrix components such as procollagen types I-III (13Massaguê J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar), and (iii) lysyl oxidase (14Feres-Filho E.J. Young J.C. Han X. Takala T.E.S. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30797-30803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Expression of the genes for the three polypeptide chains of laminin 5 is also up-regulated by TGF-β in keratinocytes (15Korang K. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Mauviel A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The induction by TGF-β1 of gene products involved in deposition of matrix in general, and of known and potential substrates of BMP-1/mTld in particular, prompted us to examine whether TGF-β1 also regulates BMP-1/mTld expression and/or the expression of PCPE. Here we document the effects of TGF-β1 on BMP-1, mTld, and PCPE expression in fibrogenic cells and keratinocytes and on levels of cleavage of type I procollagen C- and N-propeptides. Mechanisms for the post-translational regulation of BMP-1 and mTld activity are also noted, and implications of the various data for the regulation of matrix deposition are discussed.DISCUSSIONThe necessary action of BMP-1 and mTld in processing of matrix components (6Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 7Li S.-W. Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Hojima Y. Arnold W.V. Prockop D.J. Proc.

(1996) Mol. Biol. Cell, 7, Suppl., 58a (Abstr. 338).Google Scholar) and lysyl oxidase (11Panchenko M.V. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Trubetskoy O.V. Gacheru S.N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7113-7119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) implies that these proteins play key roles in controlling the deposition of matrix in developmental and homeostatic processes. Previously, however, mechanisms for regulating functional expression of these key proteins have not been explored. In this study we have demonstrated that TGF-β1 elevates levels of BMP-1 and mTld in fibrogenic cells and keratinocytes. PNP activity against procollagens I and III was also elevated by TGF-β1 in fibrogenic cells. Thus, in addition to increasing the deposition of matrix through induction of matrix components, lysyl oxidase, and metalloprotease inhibitors, TGF-β1 also influences net matrix deposition by inducing the proteases that process procollagens, laminin 5, and lysyl oxidase into mature forms.The induction of BMP-1 and mTld by TGF-β1, described here, is particularly intriguing in the context of previous suggestions that BMP-1- and tolloid-like proteins may activate TGF-β-like molecules (1Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3324) Google Scholar, 2Childs S.B. O'Connor M.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 3Finelli A.L. Bossie C.A. Xie T. Padgett R.W. Development. 1994; 120: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is itself secreted as a latent form (40Lawrence D.A. Pircher R. Kryceve-Martinerie C. Jullien P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 121: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and the possibility, therefore, exists of a positive feedback loop in which BMP-1 and/or mTld activate, and are in return induced by, TGF-β1. There is a precedent for such positive feedback loops in matrix deposition, since the effects of TGF-β1 on matrix deposition are amplified and prolonged through autoinduction by TGF-β1 of its own expression (41Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Roche N.S. Flanders K.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7741-7746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary studies with recombinant proteins suggest that BMP-1 may indeed be capable of directly activating the TGF-β1 small latent complex. 3I. Nunes, K. Takahara, D. Rifkin, and D. S. Greenspan, unpublished observations. Removal of the proregion from astacin-like proenzymes is thought necessary for the production of active forms of these enzymes (37Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, persistence or removal of the proregion represents another potential control point for regulating BMP-1 and mTld activities. In the present study, the degree of processing of secreted BMP-1 and mTld is shown to be cell type-specific, with predominantly processed forms produced by TGF-β1-treated fibrogenic cells and predominantly unprocessed forms produced by TGF-β1-treated keratinocytes. Clearly, the production of large amounts of activated BMP-1 and mTld would aid fibrogenic cells in their highly specialized roles of producing large quantities of fibrillar collagen matrix, especially in response to TGF-β. It is less clear why keratinocytes produce predominantly unprocessed, inactive forms of mTld and BMP-1 in response to TGF-β. Consistent with this finding, however, is the observation that processing of γ2, the laminin 5 chain cleaved by mTld and/or BMP-1, is delayed following secretion by cultured keratinocytes (12Amano, S., Takahara, K., Gerecke, D., Nishiyama, T., Lee, S., Greenspan, D. S., and Burgeson, R. E. (1996) Mol. Biol. Cell, 7, Suppl., 58a (Abstr. 338).Google Scholar). Thus, extracellular processing of mTld and BMP-1 may be a rate-limiting step in the deposition of keratinocyte extracellular matrix, of which laminin 5 is a major component (42Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 43Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In vivo, such processing may be regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that influence the production of matrix by basal keratinocytes (44König A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 803-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were found not to produce detectable amounts of PCPE, suggesting that PCPE may not play a role in laminin 5 processing. However, the possibility that, in vivo, PCPE may be provided by dermal fibroblasts for this purpose has not been precluded.Interestingly, the relative amounts of BMP-1 and mTld produced by cells were also found to be cell type-specific: fibrogenic cells produced relatively large amounts of BMP-1, while keratinocytes produced predominantly mTld, at both RNA and protein levels. The possible functional significance for the production of differing ratios of BMP-1 and mTld by different cell types remains to be determined, however, since a functional difference has yet to be discerned for these two protein products of the same gene.Previously, the low levels of PCP activity detectable in tissues and in cell culture systems have led to suggestions that the enzyme is either secreted as an inactive precursor or co-expressed with an endogenous inhibitor (8Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Either of these possibilities might have explained the discrepancy observed in the present study between the induction by TGF-β1 in MG-63 cultures of an ∼8-fold increase in secreted BMP-1 and a ∼2-fold increase in medium PCP activity against exogenous substrate. However, since secreted BMP-1 and mTld were both found predominantly as processed forms, this leaves the interesting possibility of an endogenously produced inhibitor. Previously, localized control over the activities of various proteases, including degradative matrix metalloproteases such as stromelysins and collagenases, has been shown to involve not only the processing of proenzymes to mature forms but also the balance between levels of activated enzyme and levels of specific inhibitors co-expressed by the same cell types (45Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3079-3083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies to determine the possible existence of inhibitors for BMP-1, mTld, and related proteases (46Takahara K. Brevard R. Hoffman G.G. Suzuki N. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1996; 34: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) seem warranted by results presented in the current study. Clearly, such inhibitors, should they exist, could play roles in morphogenetic processes as important as those of the proteases with which they interact.A final point of interest relates to the observed processing of endogenous procollagen in MG-63 cultures treated with TGF-β1 plus ascorbate and the absence of such processing in cultures treated with TGF-β1 alone. Both cultures secreted high levels of similarly processed BMP-1 and mTld. Moreover, the TGF-β1 plus ascorbate-treated cultures had only slightly higher PCP activity against exogenous substrate, corresponding to a slightly higher ratio of activated to unprocessed BMP-1. One interpretation of these data is that fully hydroxylated procollagen produced by ascorbate-treated cultures, or supplied as exogenous substrate, is much better substrate for BMP-1 than is underhydroxylated procollagen produced in the absence of ascorbate. Since underhydroxylated procollagen is not likely to be in a compact triple helical form at 37 °C (35Prockop D.J. Berg R.A. Kivirikko K.I. Uitto J. Ramachandran G.N. Reddi A.H. Biochemistry of Collagen. Plenum Press, New York1976: 163-273Crossref Google Scholar), these data might indicate some conformational requirement for the cleavage of procollagen by PCP. However, this would be in contrast to an earlier report (8Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that found PCP to cleave heat-denatured procollagen with about the same efficiency as native procollagen.

Consistent with this possibility, BMP-1 has a domain structure similar to, but shorter than, that of tolloid, a Drosophila protein that appears to act in patterning of embryos by potentiating the activity of decapentaplegic, a TGF-β family member (2Childs S.B. O'Connor M.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 3Finelli A.L. Bossie C.A. Xie T. Padgett R.W. Development. 1994; 120: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian BMP1 gene is now known to produce alternatively spliced mRNAs for BMP-1 and for a longer protein, mammalian tolloid (mTld), which has a domain structure identical to that of Drosophilatolloid (4Takahara K. Lyons G.E. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32572-32578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrillar collagen types I–III are synthesized as procollagens, precursors containing N- and C-terminal propeptides that are cleaved extracellularly to yield mature triple helical monomers capable of associating into fibrils (for a review, see Ref. 5Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Recently, BMP-1 was shown to be identical to procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) (6Kessler E. Takahara K.

Biochem. 1989; 186: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and mTld has also been found to have PCP activity (7Li S.-W. Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Hojima Y. Arnold W.V. Prockop D.J. Proc.

Greenspan, unpublished observations. Demonstration of PCP activity, however, does not preclude the possibility that BMP-1 and/or mTld may also activate TGF-β-like proteins. In fact, it is becoming increasingly apparent that products of the BMP1 gene play multiple roles in matrix deposition. These include proteolytic activation by fibrogenic cells of lysyl oxidase (11Panchenko M.V. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Trubetskoy O.V. Gacheru S.N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7113-7119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), an enzyme necessary to formation of covalent cross-links in fibrillar collagens and elastin, and biosynthetic processing by keratinocytes of laminin 5 (12Amano, S., Takahara, K., Gerecke, D., Nishiyama, T., Lee, S., Greenspan, D. S., and Burgeson, R. E. (1996) Mol. Biol. Cell, 7, Suppl., 58a (Abstr. 338).Google Scholar), a major basement membrane component of skin. PCP activity of BMP-1 is stimulated ∼10-fold by the procollagen C-proteinase enhancer (PCPE), a glycoprotein that binds the type I procollagen C-propeptide (10Kessler E. Adar R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, possible involvement of PCPE in other biological activities of BMP-1 and mTld has not been examined. TGF-β1, prototype of the TGF-β superfamily, induces net increases in the deposition of insoluble matrix by cells. This is accomplished by effecting decreased production of proteases that degrade matrix and increased production of (i) inhibitors for such proteases, (ii) structural matrix components such as procollagen types I-III (13Massaguê J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar), and (iii) lysyl oxidase (14Feres-Filho E.J. Young J.C. Han X. Takala T.E.S. Trackman P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30797-30803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Expression of the genes for the three polypeptide chains of laminin 5 is also up-regulated by TGF-β in keratinocytes (15Korang K. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. Mauviel A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The induction by TGF-β1 of gene products involved in deposition of matrix in general, and of known and potential substrates of BMP-1/mTld in particular, prompted us to examine whether TGF-β1 also regulates BMP-1/mTld expression and/or the expression of PCPE. Here we document the effects of TGF-β1 on BMP-1, mTld, and PCPE expression in fibrogenic cells and keratinocytes and on levels of cleavage of type I procollagen C- and N-propeptides. Mechanisms for the post-translational regulation of BMP-1 and mTld activity are also noted, and implications of the various data for the regulation of matrix deposition are discussed. DISCUSSIONThe necessary action of BMP-1 and mTld in processing of matrix components (6Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 7Li S.-W. Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Hojima Y. Arnold W.V. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell, 7, Suppl., 58a (Abstr. 338).Google Scholar) and lysyl oxidase (11Panchenko M.V. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Trubetskoy O.V. Gacheru S.N. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7113-7119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) implies that these proteins play key roles in controlling the deposition of matrix in developmental and homeostatic processes. Previously, however, mechanisms for regulating functional expression of these key proteins have not been explored. In this study we have demonstrated that TGF-β1 elevates levels of BMP-1 and mTld in fibrogenic cells and keratinocytes. PNP activity against procollagens I and III was also elevated by TGF-β1 in fibrogenic cells. Thus, in addition to increasing the deposition of matrix through induction of matrix components, lysyl oxidase, and metalloprotease inhibitors, TGF-β1 also influences net matrix deposition by inducing the proteases that process procollagens, laminin 5, and lysyl oxidase into mature forms.The induction of BMP-1 and mTld by TGF-β1, described here, is particularly intriguing in the context of previous suggestions that BMP-1- and tolloid-like proteins may activate TGF-β-like molecules (1Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Celeste A.J. Mitsock L.M. Whitters M.J. Kriz R.W. Hewick R.M. Wang E.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (3324) Google Scholar, 2Childs S.B. O'Connor M.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 3Finelli A.L. Bossie C.A. Xie T. Padgett R.W. Development. 1994; 120: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is itself secreted as a latent form (40Lawrence D.A. Pircher R. Kryceve-Martinerie C. Jullien P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 121: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and the possibility, therefore, exists of a positive feedback loop in which BMP-1 and/or mTld activate, and are in return induced by, TGF-β1. There is a precedent for such positive feedback loops in matrix deposition, since the effects of TGF-β1 on matrix deposition are amplified and prolonged through autoinduction by TGF-β1 of its own expression (41Van Obberghen-Schilling E. Roche N.S. Flanders K.C. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7741-7746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary studies with recombinant proteins suggest that BMP-1 may indeed be capable of directly activating the TGF-β1 small latent complex. 3I. Nunes, K. Takahara, D. Rifkin, and D. S. Greenspan, unpublished observations. Removal of the proregion from astacin-like proenzymes is thought necessary for the production of active forms of these enzymes (37Bode W. Gomis-Rüth F.X. Huber R. Zwilling R. Stöcker W. Nature. 1992; 358: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, persistence or removal of the proregion represents another potential control point for regulating BMP-1 and mTld activities. In the present study, the degree of processing of secreted BMP-1 and mTld is shown to be cell type-specific, with predominantly processed forms produced by TGF-β1-treated fibrogenic cells and predominantly unprocessed forms produced by TGF-β1-treated keratinocytes. Clearly, the production of large amounts of activated BMP-1 and mTld would aid fibrogenic cells in their highly specialized roles of producing large quantities of fibrillar collagen matrix, especially in response to TGF-β. It is less clear why keratinocytes produce predominantly unprocessed, inactive forms of mTld and BMP-1 in response to TGF-β. Consistent with this finding, however, is the observation that processing of γ2, the laminin 5 chain cleaved by mTld and/or BMP-1, is delayed following secretion by cultured keratinocytes (12Amano, S., Takahara, K., Gerecke, D., Nishiyama, T., Lee, S., Greenspan, D. S., and Burgeson, R. E. (1996) Mol. Biol. Cell, 7, Suppl., 58a (Abstr. 338).Google Scholar). Thus, extracellular processing of mTld and BMP-1 may be a rate-limiting step in the deposition of keratinocyte extracellular matrix, of which laminin 5 is a major component (42Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 43Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In vivo, such processing may be regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that influence the production of matrix by basal keratinocytes (44König A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 803-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were found not to produce detectable amounts of PCPE, suggesting that PCPE may not play a role in laminin 5 processing. However, the possibility that, in vivo, PCPE may be provided by dermal fibroblasts for this purpose has not been precluded.Interestingly, the relative amounts of BMP-1 and mTld produced by cells were also found to be cell type-specific: fibrogenic cells produced relatively large amounts of BMP-1, while keratinocytes produced predominantly mTld, at both RNA and protein levels. The possible functional significance for the production of differing ratios of BMP-1 and mTld by different cell types remains to be determined, however, since a functional difference has yet to be discerned for these two protein products of the same gene.Previously, the low levels of PCP activity detectable in tissues and in cell culture systems have led to suggestions that the enzyme is either secreted as an inactive precursor or co-expressed with an endogenous inhibitor (8Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Either of these possibilities might have explained the discrepancy observed in the present study between the induction by TGF-β1 in MG-63 cultures of an ∼8-fold increase in secreted BMP-1 and a ∼2-fold increase in medium PCP activity against exogenous substrate. However, since secreted BMP-1 and mTld were both found predominantly as processed forms, this leaves the interesting possibility of an endogenously produced inhibitor. Previously, localized control over the activities of various proteases, including degradative matrix metalloproteases such as stromelysins and collagenases, has been shown to involve not only the processing of proenzymes to mature forms but also the balance between levels of activated enzyme and levels of specific inhibitors co-expressed by the same cell types (45Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. Werb Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3079-3083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies to determine the possible existence of inhibitors for BMP-1, mTld, and related proteases (46Takahara K. Brevard R. Hoffman G.G. Suzuki N. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1996; 34: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) seem warranted by results presented in the current study. Clearly, such inhibitors, should they exist, could play roles in morphogenetic processes as important as those of the proteases with which they interact.A final point of interest relates to the observed processing of endogenous procollagen in MG-63 cultures treated with TGF-β1 plus ascorbate and the absence of such processing in cultures treated with TGF-β1 alone. Both cultures secreted high levels of similarly processed BMP-1 and mTld. Moreover, the TGF-β1 plus ascorbate-treated cultures had only slightly higher PCP activity against exogenous substrate, corresponding to a slightly higher ratio of activated to unprocessed BMP-1. One interpretation of these data is that fully hydroxylated procollagen produced by ascorbate-treated cultures, or supplied as exogenous substrate, is much better substrate for BMP-1 than is underhydroxylated procollagen produced in the absence of ascorbate. Since underhydroxylated procollagen is not likely to be in a compact triple helical form at 37 °C (35Prockop D.J. Berg R.A. Kivirikko K.I. Uitto J. Ramachandran G.N. Reddi A.H. Biochemistry of Collagen. Plenum Press, New York1976: 163-273Crossref Google Scholar), these data might indicate some conformational requirement for the cleavage of procollagen by PCP. However, this would be in contrast to an earlier report (8Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that found PCP to cleave heat-denatured procollagen with about the same efficiency as native procollagen.

We have overcome this difficulty by performing progressive carboxyl-terminal truncations of the human TSHR ectodomain (418 amino acid residues including signal peptide). Three ectodomain variants (TSHR-261, TSHR-289, and TSHR-309) were truncated at residues 261, 289, and 309, respectively. Unlike the full ectodomain, ectodomain variants were secreted with an efficiency inversely proportional to their size. Secreted ectodomain variants contained ∼20 kDa of complex carbohydrate. TSHR-261 was chosen for further study because it was secreted very efficiently and neutralized autoantibodies in Graves' patients' sera. This ectodomain variant was partially purified using sequential lectin and nickel-chelate chromatography, permitting the first direct visualization and quantitation of the mammalian TSHR. Most important, very small (nanogram) quantities of this material neutralized 70–100% of TSHR autoantibody activity in all 18 Graves' sera studied.In summary, carboxyl-terminal truncation of the human TSHR ectodomain generates a secreted protein with complex carbohydrate that neutralizes autoantibodies in Graves' patients' sera. Antigenically active TSHR will be valuable for future studies on the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and immunotherapy of Graves' disease.

Graves' disease is a very common (∼1% prevalence) (1Vanderpump M.P.J. Tunbridge W.M.G. French J.M. Appleton D. Bates D. Clark F. Grimley Evans J. Hasan D.M. Rodgers H. Tunbridge F. Young E.T. Clin. Endocrinol. 1995; 43: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar), organ-specific autoimmune disease, affecting only humans. Unlike in diabetes mellitus, type I, a less common organ-specific disease, there is no spontaneous animal model for Graves' disease. Also in contrast to diabetes mellitus, type I, one specific antigen is unequivocally and directly involved in the pathogenesis of Graves' disease, namely the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR). 1The abbreviations used are: TSHR, thyrotropin receptor; TSH, thyrotropin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ConA, concanavalin A; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; CG, chorionic gonadoptropin; LH, luteinizing hormone; TBI, TSH binding inhibition; LAA, long acting thyroid stimulator absorbing activity. Thus autoantibodies to the TSHR activate the receptor, leading to thyroid overactivity and thyrotoxicosis (reviewed in Ref. 2Rees Smith B. McLachlan S.M. Furmaniak J. Endocr. Rev. 1988; 9: 106-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The interaction between autoantibodies and the TSHR is, therefore, of interest from the theoretical, diagnostic, and (potentially) therapeutic points of view. Because of the importance of the TSHR as an autoantigen, a large effort has been made in the 7 years since the molecular cloning of its cDNA (3Nagayama Y. Kaufman K.D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Biochem.

Autoimmunity. 1994; 17: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, the generation of effective TSHR antigen has been extraordinarily difficult. Thus, despite this major effort and although some of these approaches have appeared promising, it is remarkable that a direct assay for TSHR autoantibodies using recombinant TSHR antigen has not supplanted the indirect, TSH binding-inhibition assay with porcine thyroid extracts (25Shewring G.A. Rees Smith B. Clin. Endocrinol. 1982; 17: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) in use for nearly 2 decades. Moreover, lack of effective antigen has hampered mechanistic and structural studies of autoantibody-TSHR autoantigen interactions. An important factor contributing to this difficulty is that TSHR autoantibodies, like TSH, predominantly recognize discontinuous, highly conformational epitopes (26Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L.

Recombinant TSHR expressed on the surface of mammalian cells are conformationally intact and are unquestionably recognized by autoantibodies in patients' sera (29Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D.

Kanai A. Isozaki O. Yoshida T. Tsushima T. Yasukawa K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and TSHR overexpression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO cells) has been achieved by transgenome amplification (32Chazenbalk G.D. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the seven membrane-spanning segments of the TSHR do not facilitate purification. Contrary to expectations, when the 418-amino acid residue, autoantibody-binding TSHR ectodomain is expressed in CHO cells without its serpentine region, it is not secreted but is retained within the cell (33Harfst E. Johnstone A.P. Nussey S.S. Lancet. 1992; 339: 193-194Abstract PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 34Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), largely in a form containing high mannose carbohydrate (34Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, this TSHR ectodomain with immature carbohydrate is not recognized by autoantibodies in patients' sera (34Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We now report that, in contrast to the entire TSHR ectodomain, progressive carboxyl-terminal truncations lead to thesecretion by CHO cells of a modified TSHR ectodomain with mature, complex carbohydrate. Further, by epitope-tagging this autoantigen and by amplifying its transgenome in CHO cells, we report the first direct visualization and quantification of TSHR of mammalian cell origin. Most important, this material can neutralize all or most TSHR binding activity in patients' sera. Antigenically active TSHR will provide a major impetus for future studies on the pathogenesis of Graves' disease. We generated three plasmids for expression in mammalian cells of limited TSHR ectodomain truncations (Fig. 1).Figure 5Immunoblots of TSHR-261 enriched from conditioned medium using lectins. Material obtained from equivalent volumes of the same medium using B. simplificifolia, concanavalin A, or wheat germ agglutinin was either left untreated (−) or was subjected to endoglycosidase H (ENDO H) or endoglycosidase F (ENDO F) digestion (see “Materials and Methods”). The samples were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel.

The serpentine transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions of the holoreceptor (764 amino acid residues including signal peptide) are not shown. Six histidine residues (6H) followed by a stop codon are inserted after the indicated TSHR residues. Insertion of a stop codon at residue 418 has previously been shown to generate an ectodomain containing predominantly high mannose carbohydrate that is largely retained within the cell and is not recognized by TSHR autoantibodies in Graves' patients' sera (34Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As shown in the present study, progressive carboxyl-terminal truncations of the TSHR ectodomain lead to a high level of secretion of material with mature, complex carbohydrate that can completely neutralize TSHR autoantibody activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Plasmid TSHR-5′TR-NEO-ECE (35Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G. Filetti S. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2664-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) contains anAflII site at codon 260 and an XbaI site in the vector at the 3 end of the insert. The AflII-XbaI fragment was excised and replaced with a cassette coding for 6 histidine residues (His6), followed by 2 stop codons. The cassette was created by annealing two oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-TTAACCATCACCACCACCATCACTGATAAT; antisense, 5′-CTAGATTATCAGTGATGGTGGTGGTGATGG. Ligation at the AflII site generated an Asn residue upstream of the His6, hence the nomenclature “261.” A cDNA fragment including the AflII site at codon 260 continuing to codon 289 followed by anSpeI site was generated by polymerase chain reaction usingPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). This fragment was used to replace the AflII-SpeI segment in TSHR-5′TR-NEO-ECE (the SpeI site is at codon 418) (26Nagayama Y. Wadsworth H.L. Chazenbalk G.D. Russo D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Subsequently, an oligonucleotide cassette coding for His6 followed by 2 stop codons with SpeI andXbaI adhesive ends was inserted into the same sites of the intermediate construct (sense, 5′-CTAGCCATCACCACCACCATCACTGATAAT; antisense, as described above for TSHR-261). Construction used the identical strategy to that of TSHR-289, except that the AflII-SpeI cDNA fragment generated by polymerase chain reaction extended up to codon 309. After confirmation of the nucleotide sequences of the relevant areas, the TSHR-261, TSHR-289, and TSHR-309 cDNAs were excised withSalI and XbaI and transferred to the vector pSV2-ECE-dhfr (36Kaufman K.D. Foti D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 78: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell lines, stably transfected with the above TSHR ectodomain cDNA variants were established in CHO dhfr− cells (CHO-DG44; kindly provided by Dr. Robert Schimke, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA), using procedures described previously (34Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transgenome amplification was achieved by progressive adaptation to growth in methotrexate (final concentration 10 μm) (34Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CHO cells to be tested for TSHR ectodomain variant expression were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, exactly as described previously (1-h pulse and overnight chase) (32Chazenbalk G.D. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The medium was harvested for immunoprecipitation of secreted TSHR protein, and the cells were processed further for analysis of intracellular TSHR protein, as described previously (32Chazenbalk G.D. Kakinuma A. Jaume J.C. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4586-4591Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Cells, lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, were centrifuged for 45 min at 100,000 × gprior to preclearing with mouse IgG and protein A, followed by immunoprecipitation using mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) A10 (37Nicholson L.B. Vlase H. Graves P. Nilsson M. Molne J. Huang G.C. Morgenthaler N.G. Davies T.F. McGregor A.M. Banga J.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Paul Banga, King's College, London, United Kingdom; epitope at amino acid residues 22–35; final dilution of 1:1000). Medium was precleared in the same manner, except that in later experiments mouse IgG was not prebound to the protein A. Samples were subjected to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Prestained molecular size markers (Bio-Rad) were precalibrated against more accurate unstained markers to obtain the molecular weights indicated in the text. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography on Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). TSHR secreted into the medium was also detected by means of their His6 tag using Ni-NTA resin (QIAGEN, Inc, Chatsworth, CA) according to the procedure reported previously (34Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). TSHR autoantibody kits were purchased from Kronus, San Clemente, CA. The principal of this assay is the ability of autoantibodies to compete for 125I-TSH binding to TSHR solubilized from porcine thyroid glands (“TSH binding inhibition,” or TBI assay) (25Shewring G.A. Rees Smith B. Clin. Endocrinol. 1982; 17: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In brief, solubilized TSHR (50 μl) are preincubated (15 min) with patient's serum (50 μl). Buffer containing 125I-TSH is then added (2 h at room temperature). Solubilized TSHR complexed with TSH is precipitated by polyethylene glycol. Antibody activity is measured as percent inhibition of 125I-TSH binding relative to a standard serum from a normal individual without autoantibodies. We modified this assay by preincubating (30 min at room temperature) serum from Graves' patients (25 μl) with conditioned medium from cells expressing TSHR ectodomain variants (25 μl). Solubilized TSHR (50 μl) was then added to the serum/medium mixture (50 μl). As controls, we used serum from normal individuals and conditioned medium from CHO cells secreting a truncated form of thyroid peroxidase (36Kaufman K.D. Foti D. Seto P. Rapoport B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 78: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Binding of TSHR in conditioned medium was determined for three Sepharose-linked lectins: wheat germ agglutinin, Bandeiraea simplificifolia, and concanavalin A (ConA) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Medium (40 ml) was slowly stirred for 2 h at room temperature with 0.4 ml of Sepharose lectin. The beads were then extensively washed in batch with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and adsorbed material released (tumbling for 45 min at room temperature) with 3 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 0.25 m N-acetylglucosamine (wheat germ agglutinin), 20 mm α-methylgalactopyranoside (B. simplificifolia), and 0.5 m α-methylmannoside (ConA). Material (3 μl) was diluted as indicated in the text and spotted on nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). After air drying, the filters were incubated (45 min) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline) containing 5.0% skim milk powder, rinsed and incubated (2 h at 37 °C) in Tris-buffered saline containing mAb A10 (1:1000) and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The filters were rinsed, incubated (1 h at room temperature) with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G, and the signal developed as described previously (34Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Lectin-bound TSHR-261, TSHR-289, and TSHR-309 were eluted (see above), and Laemmli sample buffer (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with 0.7 m (final concentration) β-mercaptoethanol was added (30 min at 45 °C). Enzymatic deglycosylation with N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H was as described previously (34Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis on SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gels, proteins were electophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes, which were then processed as described above with the exception that incubation in mAb A10 was overnight and the second antibody was added for 1–2 h. In some experiments (e.g. Fig. 6), the immunoblots were developed using the BioMax-CDS-PRO kit (Kodak) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Autoradiography was with Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham). Conditioned medium was harvested from CHO cells expressing TSHR-261 cultured in non-selective F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics and 5 mm sodium butyrate (39Dorner A.J. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20602-20607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Medium (2 liters) was applied to a 70-ml concanavalin A-Sepharose column. After washing with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, bound material was eluted with ∼80 ml of 0.15m α-methyl-mannoside in the same buffer. The eluted material was made up to 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, and applied to two 5-ml His-Trap columns in series (Pharmacia). Elution was with buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, and 100 mm EDTA. The sample was concentrated and the buffer exchanged to 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl using a Centriprep 30 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). At all stages, TSHR-261 recovery was monitored by bioassay (TBI neutralization; see above). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the deglycosylated TSHR-261, cut out from a PVDF membrane, was determined by the Protein Structure Laboratory, University of California, Davis. CHO-DG44 cells were stably transfected with plasmids coding for TSHR ectodomain variants truncated at amino acid residues 261, 289, and 309 (Fig.1). Individual clones were obtained by limiting dilution, and transgenome amplification was performed by progressive adaptation to growth in methotrexate (final concentration 10 μm). One clone of each TSHR ectodomain variant, selected for high level of TSHR expression, was expanded and used for further studies. The ectodomain variant with the greatest degree of COOH-terminal truncation (TSHR-261) was entirely secreted into the medium, as detected by immunoprecipitation after an overnight chase, with no receptor remaining in the cells (Fig. 2). TSHR-289, truncated to a lesser extent, was secreted to an intermediate degree. The receptor remaining within the cells was present in multiple forms, the dominant band having a molecular weight lower than the secreted form. Finally, for TSHR-309, the least truncated ectodomain, secretion into the medium was relatively inefficient. Thus, proportionately less receptor was secreted than remained within the cells, the latter primarily in lower molecular weight form. Expression of the 6 His residues at the carboxyl termini of the ectodomain variants was confirmed by nickel-NTA resin purification of precursor-labeled material secreted into the culture medium (Fig. 2). In contrast, the TSHR variants could not be clearly identified within the cell because the nickel-NTA resin bound to a large number of labeled intracellular proteins (data not shown). Because our main purpose in generating a secreted form of the TSHR ectodomain was to obtain material suitable for study with TSHR autoantibodies in the serum of patients with Graves' disease, it was important to test the secreted TSHR ectodomain variants for this property. We used a TBI assay to test whether conditioned medium from cultured cells expressing TSHR-261, TSHR-289, and TSHR-309 could neutralize autoantibody activity in a Graves' patient's serum. Of these, TSHR-261 and TSHR-289 were clearly active in terms of reversing the inhibition by TSHR autoantibodies of 125I-TSH binding (Fig. 3). Although the Ni-NTA resin was effective in purifying radiolabeledTSHR secreted by CHO cells into tissue culture medium (Fig. 2), we were unable to purify unlabeled TSHR protein from medium using this approach. The Ni-NTA bound to many unlabeled proteins despite attempts to minimize nonspecific interactions with imidazole and adsorption at lower pH (data not shown). We, therefore, attempted partial purification of TSHR ectodomain variants from conditioned medium using lectins. TSHR-261 in conditioned medium bound poorly to wheat germ agglutinin and B. simplicifolia (Fig.4). Almost all of this material remained in the “flow-through,” and minimal amounts could be recovered by elution with specific sugar. In contrast, ConA was effective in extracting TSHR-261 from the medium. Because the non-secreted, full-length TSHR ectodomain that did not interact with TSHR autoantibodies contained immature, high mannose carbohydrate and bound strongly to ConA (34Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we were concerned that the ConA was extracting an inactive, high mannose component of TSHR-261, perhaps released from disintegrating cells. Fortunately, this was not the case. Thus, immunoblotting of ConA-enriched TSHR-261 showed that, like the material immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium with mAb A10 (Fig. 2), the secreted receptor was endoglycosidase - resistant and endoglycosidase F-sensitive (complex carbohydrate) (Fig.5). Indeed, this pattern was similar to the smaller amounts of TSHR-261 that could be recovered from conditioned medium using wheat germ agglutinin (Fig. 5). Most important, the ConA-enriched material was highly active in neutralizing autoantibody TBI activity in patients' sera (data not shown for these experiments; see data below on TBI activity in more extensive studies using multiple Graves' sera; Fig. 8). In addition to TSHR-261, TSHR-289 and TSHR-309 were also extracted from culture medium using ConA. Immunoblotting indicated that TSHR-289 and TSHR-309, like TSHR-261, contained only mature, complex carbohydrate (Fig. 6). Remarkably, TSHR-261 contains ∼20 kDa ofN-linked glycosylation, 40% of its mass. The apparent molecular masses of the deglycosylated proteins (∼30, 32, and 34 kDa for TSHR-261, TSHR-289, and TSHR-309, respectively) were slightly (∼2 kDa) greater than predicted from their known amino acid sequences (including His6 tags). A similar phenomenon was observed previously with the deglycosylated TSHR ectodomain (residues 1–418) (34Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Kakinuma A. Chazenbalk G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the preceding studies, the secreted TSHR variants could be detectedqualitatively by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, or autoantibody neutralization. However, it was important to determinequantitatively the amount of receptor that was interacting with TSHR autoantibodies in patients' sera. No TSHR standards are available for this purpose. Indeed, the TSHR of mammalian cell origin has never been purified sufficiently for direct visualization on a polyacrylamide gel. We selected TSHR-261 for further study because, of the three ectodomain variants, it was secreted to the greatest extent (Fig. 2) and because its “bioactivity” in terms of autoantibody recognition appeared equal to that of TSHR-289 (Fig. 3). As monitored by autoantibody neutralization, ConA chromatography provided an initial purification of ∼100-fold. Subsequently, and in contrast to its use as an initial capture system, nickel-chelate chromatography was quite effective in generating sufficient TSHR-261 for direct visualization and quantitation by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 7, left panel). Enzymatic deglycosylation confirmed the immunoblot evidence for a ∼30-kDa polypeptide backbone with ∼20 kDa of complex carbohydrate (Fig. 7,right panel) and also provided the best means to quantitate the amount of receptor recovered. In three separate preparations from 2 liters of conditioned medium, recovery of TSHR-261 (corrected for a 40% glycan component) was 0.3–0.4 mg/liter. Amino acid sequencing of the 3"

The mutations do not affect expression of either the mitochondrially or nuclearly encoded subunits of the enzyme. The cytochrome oxidase deficiency also does not appear to be related to mitochondrial copper metabolism or heme <i>a</i>biosynthesis. These data suggest that the mutants are likely to be impaired in assembly of the enzyme. A gene designated <i>COX15</i>has been cloned by transformation of mutants from complementation group G4. This gene is identical to reading frame YER141w on chromosome 5. To facilitate further studies, Cox15p has been expressed as a biotinylated protein. Biotinylated Cox15p fully restores cytochrome oxidase in<i>cox15</i> mutants, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal sequence with biotin does not affect its function. Cox15p is a constituent of the mitochondrial inner membrane and, because of its resistance to proteolysis, probably is largely embedded in the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane. The present studies further emphasize the complexity of cytochrome oxidase assembly and report a new constituent of mitochondria involved in this process. The existence of <i>COX15</i> homologs in <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>and <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> suggests that it may be widely distributed in eucaryotic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2083508893,"We have previously identified distinct nuclear and mitochondrial isoforms of dUTPase in human cells, reporting the cDNA sequence of the nuclear isoform (DUT-N). We now report a cDNA corresponding to the mitochondrial isoform (DUT-M). The DUT-M cDNA contains an 252-amino acid open reading frame, encoding a protein with a predicted M r of 26,704. The amino-terminal region of the protein contains an arginine-rich, 69-residue mitochondrial targeting presequence that is absent in the mature protein. In vitro transcription and translation of the DUT-M cDNA results in the production of a precursor protein with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DUT-M precursor is enzymatically active and immunoreacts with a dUTPase-specific monoclonal antibody. Mitochondrial import and processing studies demonstrate that the DUT-M precursor is processed into a 23-kDa protein and imported into mitochondria in vitro. Isoelectric focusing experiments demonstrate that the DUT-N has a pI of 6.0, while the processed form of DUT-M has a more basic pI of 8.1, measurements that are in agreement with predicted values. Studies aimed at understanding the expression of these isoforms were performed utilizing quiescent and replicating 34Lu human lung fibroblasts as a model cell culture system. Northern blot analysis, employing an isoform-specific probe, demonstrates that DUT-N and DUT-M are encoded by two distinct mRNA species of 1.1 and 1.4 kilobases, respectively. Western and Northern blot analysis reveal that DUT-M protein and mRNA are expressed in a constitutive fashion, independent of cell cycle phase or proliferation status. In contrast, DUT-N protein and mRNA levels are tightly regulated to coincide with nuclear DNA replication status. Because DUT-N and DUT-M have identical amino acid and cDNA sequences in their overlapping regions, we set out to determine if they were encoded by the same gene. The 5′ region of the gene encoding dUTPase was isolated and characterized by a combination of Southern hybridization and DNA sequencing. These analyses demonstrate that the dUTPase isoforms are encoded by the same gene with isoform-specific transcripts arising through the use of alternative 5′ exons. This finding represents the first example in humans of alternative 5′ exon usage to generate differentially expressed nuclear and mitochondrial specific protein isoforms.

This finding represents the first example in humans of alternative 5′ exon usage to generate differentially expressed nuclear and mitochondrial specific protein isoforms. dUTPase (EC 3.6.1.23) catalyzes the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate, simultaneously removing dUTP from the DNA biosynthetic pathway and providing substrate (dUMP) for the de novosynthesis of thymidylate (1Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The importance of the dUTPase function in prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral systems has been firmly established in recent years. dUTPase is essential for viability inEscherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and was shown to be required for efficient DNA replication in several viral systems (2El-Hajj H.H. Zhang H. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gadsden M.H. McIntosh E.M. Game J.C. Wilson P.J. Haynes R.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4425-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 4Threadgill D.S. Steagall W.K. Flaherty M.T. Fuller F.J. Perry S.T. Rushlow K.E. Le Grice S.F.J. Payne S.L. J.

The importance of the dUTPase function in the human system has been further distinguished by its importance in anti-thymidylate chemotherapy. Thymidylate metabolism has been an important target for the development of widely utilized chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil, fluorodeoxyuridine, and ZD1694 that are used in the treatment of breast and gastrointestinal tumors. The enzymatic target of these compounds, thymidylate synthase (TS), 1The abbreviations used are: TS, thymidylate synthase; DUT-N, nuclear isoform of human dUTPase; DUT-M, mitochondrial isoform of human dUTPase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase(s). generates dTMP from dUMP and a folate cofactor. Investigations by several laboratories suggest that the basis of cytotoxicity caused by inhibition of de novo thymidylate metabolism may be the accumulation of excessive dUTP pools (6Beck W.R.

Brown O.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). TS inhibition induces a dramatic elevation of dUTP pools resulting in chronic dUMP misincorporation into DNA during replication and repair, leading to DNA fragmentation and cell death (7Curtin N.J. Harris A.L. Aherne G.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2346-2352PubMed Google Scholar). Work published by Curtin et al. (7Curtin N.J. Harris A.L. Aherne G.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2346-2352PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrates a significant correlation between intracellular dUTP levels and the magnitude of DNA damage resulting from TS inhibition. dUTPase (the major regulator of dUTP pools in humans) plays a protective role by limiting dUTP accumulation in the cell and countering the cytotoxic effect of TS inhibition. Recently, direct evidence supporting this role was demonstrated. Overexpression of the E. coli dUTPase in HT29 human colorectal tumor cells resulted in the induction of resistance to the TS inhibitor fluorodeoxyuridine (10Canman C.E. Radany E.H. Parsels L.A. Davis M.A. Lawrence T.S. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2296-2298PubMed Google Scholar). These studies provide substantial evidence suggesting that levels of the dUTPase enzyme may be a critical factor in determining fluorodeoxyuridine toxicity in certain cancer types. The essential nature of dUTPase during DNA replication and its role in anti-thymidylate chemotherapy has led many authors to speculate on the use of human dUTPase as a target for future chemotherapeutic design (6Beck W.R.

A. 1992; 89: 8020-8024Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, the recent determination of the human dUTPase crystal structure represents a clear step toward the development of structure-based dUTPase inhibitors (13Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainor J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In recent years, there have been major advances in our understanding of the protein biochemistry of human dUTPase. Several laboratories have described the cloning of dUTPase cDNAs (11Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12McIntosh E.M. Ager D.D. Gadsden M.H.

Hanash S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the crystal structure of a recombinant form of human dUTPase has recently been solved (13Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainor J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The resulting structural data demonstrate that human dUTPase exists as a homotrimer with active site residues contributed by adjacent subunits (13Mol C.D. Harris J.M. McIntosh E.M. Tainor J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1077-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has recently discovered that distinct mitochondrial (DUT-M) and nuclear (DUT-N) isoforms of this enzyme exist in human cells (11Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The isoforms are separable by SDS-PAGE, with DUT-N having an apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa and the processed form of DUT-M having an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa. To determine the structural differences between these isoforms, a combination of NH2-terminal protein sequencing and mass spectrometry was utilized to characterize each form in detail, demonstrating that the two isoforms are largely identical, differing only in a short region of their amino termini. Analysis of dUTPase phosphorylation demonstrated that DUT-N is serine-phosphorylated at a consensus cyclin-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site (Ser11 of DUT-N), suggesting a link to cell cycle regulation (15Ladner R.D. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. McNulty D.E. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7752-7757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). While DUT-M contains the identical site, it does not undergo phosphorylation in HeLa cells. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis demonstrates that serine phosphorylation of DUT-N does not regulate enzymatic activity, and the biological significance of DUT-N phosphorylation remains unclear (15Ladner R.D. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. McNulty D.E. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7752-7757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of each isoform demonstrates that they retain identical affinities for dUTP despite their structural differences. Our current knowledge of dUTPase expression in higher eukaryotes is limited. Studies of dUTPase in plants suggest that expression is linked to the rate of proliferation, as demonstrated by a close association of dUTPase activity and replicative vegetative and floral meristem regions (16Pri-Hadash A. Hareven D. Lifschitz E. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 149-159PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pardon E.G. Gutierrez C. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 186: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, the dUTPase gene was isolated from the human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, the expression of which is governed in part by an MluI cell cycle box element located in the promoter region (18McIntosh E.M. Looser J. Haynes R.H. Pearlman R.E. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This element was shown to be critical for the proliferation-dependent transcriptional regulation of the dUTPase gene. In the human system, studies utilizing peripheral blood lymphocytes suggest that dUTPase expression is also associated with proliferative status (14Strahler J.R. Zhu X.X. Hora N. Wang Y.K. Andrews P.C. Roseman N.A. Neel J.V. Turka L. Hanash S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, this previous study is unclear with respect to the expression of distinct nuclear and mitochondrial isoforms. The present investigation was undertaken to extend our previous work characterizing human dUTPase isoforms and elucidate the mechanisms governing isoform expression. 34Lu human lung fibroblasts (CRL 1491) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cells were synchronized by incubation in serum-free minimal essential medium for 72 h. Cells were then released from G0 by the addition of minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Progression through the cell cycle was monitored in serum-stimulated and -starved cells by [3H]thymidine incorporation. At 3- or 6-h intervals after serum stimulation/starvation, cells were labeled for 20 min with 10 μl of [3H]thymidine (1 mCi/ml). The remainder of the procedures were performed as described previously (19Muller S.J. Caradonna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1310-1319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A λgt10 cDNA library was constructed from mRNA derived from serum-starved 34Lu human lung fibroblasts. Total RNA was isolated using the reagents and protocols of TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified with the Poly(A)Ttract mRNA isolation system (Promega). cDNA construction was performed using the Superscript Choice system for cDNA synthesis (Life Technologies). The library was screened using a 935-bpSphI/EcoRI fragment of the DUT-N cDNA cloned by this laboratory (11Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This DNA fragment contains sequence common to both the DUT-N and DUT-M isoforms. The library screening protocol was based on standard procedures as described by Sambrook et al.(20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Several cDNA isolates were subcloned into theEcoRI site of pGEM-3Z (Promega). These clones were sequenced using the Sequenase dideoxy chain termination kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A series of subclones were generated using internal restriction sites to facilitate sequencing of the cDNA isolates in their entirety. The sequences were determined from both strands. An EMBL-3 human leukocyte genomic library (CLONTECH) was screened with the DUT-N cDNA (11Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The library screening protocol was based on standard procedures as described by Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Several clones were isolated, and the three largest (9–15 kb) were further characterized by a combination of restriction digestion, Southern hybridization, and sequence analysis. An oligonucleotide probe (5′-GGTGTCTCTTCAGAGCAGG-3′) corresponding to the extreme 5′ end of the DUT-N cDNA was synthesized and used to identify a 2.7-kbEcoRI/BamHI genomic fragment. This fragment was subsequently sequenced using a series of nested sequencing primers designed from newly obtained sequence information. Coupled in vitro transcription and translation was performed using the TNT system purchased from Promega. The open reading frames of both DUT-M and DUT-N were cloned into pGEM-3Z in the T7 and SP6 orientations, respectively. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate; 2 μl of TNT reaction buffer; 20 μm concentration of each amino acid minus methionine; 45 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham, SJ235, 15 mCi/ml, >1000 Ci/mmol); 2 units of either SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase; and 2 μg of plasmid (pGEM-3Z) containing either DUT-N or DUT-M. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Mitochondria were isolated by the procedure of Rickwoodet al. (21Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 1-16Google Scholar) using differential centrifugation after cells were disrupted by homogenization. For complete details of this procedure, see Caradonna et al. (23Lirette R. Caradonna S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The purified mitochondria were washed twice in MESH buffer (20 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.4; 220 mm mannitol; 70 mmsucrose; and 0.1 mm EDTA) and used directly for import studies. Mitochondrial import of in vitro expressed proteins was performed as described previously (22Caradonna S.J. Ladner R. Hansbury M. Kosciuk M. Lynch F. Muller S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 345-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μl of radiolabeled translation reaction was mixed with 25 μl of the prepared mitochondria (at 5 mg/ml total protein). Reactions were allowed to proceed for the indicated times at 30 °C and then chilled on ice. The sample was either disrupted by sonication followed by dUTPase protein immunoprecipitation or further processed as described next. The mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice in 500 μl of MESH buffer. The mitochondria were subsequently resuspended in 20 μl of MESH buffer and incubated with 20 μg/ml trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated and affinity-purified; Promega) for 30 min on ice. The mitochondria were washed twice more with 500 μl each of MESH buffer and sonicated, and dUTPase protein was immunoprecipitated. dUTPase protein was subsequently fractionated by 15% PAGE, and the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film to visualize the radiolabeled protein. dUTPase-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb 415) were generated and prepared as described previously (23Lirette R. Caradonna S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 5 μl of mAb (1 mg/ml) was used. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (23Lirette R. Caradonna S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). dUTPase-specific polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant DUT-N protein (expressed in the baculovirus system) as described previously (11Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibodies were purified by dUTPase protein affinity chromatography and used for immunoblot analysis at a dilution of 1:1000. Enzyme assays were performed as described previously (10Canman C.E. Radany E.H. Parsels L.A. Davis M.A. Lawrence T.S. Maybaum J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2296-2298PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional PAGE was performed using a Mini-PROTEAN II cell obtained from Bio-Rad. Procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations and as described in Strahler et al. (14Strahler J.R. Zhu X.X. Hora N. Wang Y.K. Andrews P.C. Roseman N.A. Neel J.V. Turka L. Hanash S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (11Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 34Lu cells using the Trizol Reagent method (Life Technologies), and poly(A)+ RNA was isolated with the Poly(A)Ttract mRNA isolation system (Promega) using the protocols supplied by the manufacturer. In each case, 1 μg of mRNA was electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with 32P-labeled random-primed cDNA probe (SphI/EcoRI DUT-N fragment or GAPDH cDNA) or with a DUT-M-specific probe (290-bp AluI/EcoRI fragment). Blots probed with random-primed cDNAs were hybridized at 42 °C overnight in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE: 0.18 m NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.7)), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The filters were washed twice at room temperature in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (5 min); twice in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C (15 min); and twice in 0.2 × SSC at 65 °C (15 min). The blots were subsequently exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. Blots were stripped by boiling for 10 min in 0.5% SDS prior to reprobing. Previous studies by this laboratory have demonstrated that DUT-N and DUT-M proteins are nearly identical, differing only in a short region of their amino termini (11Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, we speculated that their respective mRNAs would also be identical in their overlapping regions. We therefore utilized the 3′ end of the DUT-N cDNA (SphI/EcoRI, 935-bp restriction fragment) to screen for a cDNA isolate corresponding to the DUT-M isoform. This restriction fragment removes the 5′ end of the DUT-N cDNA coding for DUT-N-specific amino acids, leaving the 3′ end containing sequence shared between the isoforms. A cDNA library was constructed from mRNA derived from 34Lu human lung fibroblasts that were serum-starved. Quiescent 34Lu cells were shown to express only the mitochondrial isoform, thus providing a greater likelihood of identifying a DUT-M-specific cDNA (described hereafter). Screening the 34Lu library resulted in the identification of 10 positive clones, four of which were chosen for plaque purification and subsequent characterization. The isolates were subcloned into theEcoRI site of pGEM-3Z, and subsequent sequence analysis indicated that all four isolates encode the DUT-M isoform based on comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the experimentally determined protein sequence of DUT-M (11Ladner R.D. McNulty D.E. Carr S.A. Roberts G.D. Caradonna S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7745-7751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence and open reading frame of the largest DUT-M cDNA (960 bp) is presented in Fig. 1. The DUT-M open reading frame (starting at nucleotide 63) corresponds to a 252-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 26,704. The first 342 nucleotides of the DUT-M cDNA are unique. Nucleotides 343–960 are identical to residues 46–664 of the DUT-N cDNA previously reported by this lab (Fig. 2 A). The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that the DUT-M protein possesses an arginine-rich, 69-amino acid leader sequence, which is removed in the mature protein. Amino acid residues 1–93 are unique to DUT-M, while residues 94–252 are common to both nuclear and mitochondrial forms (Fig. 2 B). The cDNA does not contain a consensus polyadenylation signal and appears to be incomplete at the 3′ end as evidenced by a lack of a poly(A) tail. During cDNA library construction, random hexamers were used to prime during first strand cDNA synthesis instead of oligo-dT; this may account for the lack of a complete 3′ end.Figure 1Nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the mitochondrial isoform of human dUTPase, DUT-M. A 252-amino acid open reading frame is encoded beginning at position 63. A 69-residue, NH2-terminal mitochondrial targeting presequence is proteolytically removed upon import into the mitochondria. The amino termini of the mature, processed DUT-M protein begins at Ala70.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Comparison of the cDNA and amino acid sequences of DUT-N and DUT-M.

Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this model, an arginine-rich, 69-residue presequence is predicted by the DUT-M cDNA. The 69-residue presequence has a calculated pI of 12.9, while the full-length DUT-M sequence has a calculated pI of 9.97. Reports of homologous nuclear encoded mitochondrial and cytosolic/nuclear isoproteins confirm that mitochondrial proteins have a more basic overall charge than their cytosolic/nuclear counterparts (25Jaussi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). DUT-N has a predicted pI of 6.16, while the processed form of DUT-M has a predicted pI of 8.23. To experimentally determine the pI values of the dUTPase isoforms, two-dimensional SDS-PAGE was employed. Total HeLa cell extract and extract from purified mitochondria were fractionated separately by two-dimensional PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and dUTPase isoforms were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 3,A and B). Detection of dUTPase from total cell extract (Fig. 3 A) reveals two proteins with isoelectric points of 6.0 and 8.1. These pI values correlate with the predicted values for DUT-N and DUT-M, respectively. Fractionation of protein derived from purified mitochondria confirms that the protein with the pI of 8.1 is in fact DUT-M (Fig. 3 B). To confirm the identity of the DUT-M cDNA, a plasmid construct containing the DUT-M open reading frame was subjected to in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. dUTPase protein was immunoprecipitated from the lysate with dUTPase-specific monoclonal antibody, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray film. Alternatively, the immunoprecipitated protein was assayed for dUTPase activity. The DUT-N open reading frame was used as a positive control in these experiments (Fig. 4,lane 1). As demonstrated in Fig. 4, lane 2,in vitro transcription/translation of the DUT-M cDNA results in the production of a precursor protein with an apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa that immunoreacts with dUTPase monoclonal antibody. A second minor protein species is also evident of slightly lower molecular weight. We believe this is an artifact of thein vitro transcription/translation system, possibly due to the use of a second in-frame methionine codon at position 129 of the DUT-M nucleotide sequence. In vitro dUTPase assays demonstrate that the DUT-M precursor protein retains dUTPase activity despite an extended amino terminus contributed by the mitochondrial targeting presequence (data not shown). To further establish the mitochondrial localization of the DUT-M protein, in vitro import experiments were performed to demonstrate that the DUT-M precursor is taken up by mitochondria and proteolytically cleaved into a lower molecular weight, mature form. DUT-M was transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine in vitro and incubated for various times with mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells. DUT-N was used as a negative control in these experiments. The results of these experiments are seen in Fig.5 A. Lane 1 shows DUT-M protein without treatment, and lanes 2–5 show DUT-M protein that was incubated with purified mitochondria for 10, 20, 30, and 40 min, respectively. These data clearly demonstrate that, upon incubation with mitochondria, the"

In this context, brine shrimp embryos can endure a wide variety of stressful conditions, including temperature extremes, prolonged anoxia, and desiccation, thus encountering shortages of both energy (ATP) and water. How the embryos survive these stresses is the subject of continuing study, a situation true for other organisms facing similar physiological challenges. To approach this question we cloned and sequenced a cDNA for p26, a molecular chaperone specific to oviparous Artemia embryos. p26 is the first representative of the small heat shock/α-crystallin family from crustaceans to be sequenced, and it possesses the conserved α-crystallin domain characteristic of these proteins. The secondary structure of this domain was predicted to consist predominantly of β-pleated sheet, and it appeared to lack regions of α-helix. Unique properties of the nonconserved amino terminus, which showed weak similarity to nucleolins and fibrillarins, are enrichments in both glycine and arginine. The carboxyl-terminal tail is the longest yet reported for a small heat shock/α-crystallin protein, and it is hydrophilic, a common attribute of this region. Site-specific differences between amino acids from p26 and other small heat shock/α-crystallin proteins bring into question the functions proposed for some of these residues. Probing of Southern blots disclosed a multi-gene family for p26, whereas two size classes of p26 mRNA at 0.7 and 1.9 kilobase pairs were seen on Northern blots, the larger probably representing nonprocessed transcripts. Examination of immunofluorescently stained samples with the confocal microscope revealed that a limited portion of intracellular p26 is found in the nuclei of encysted embryos and that it resides within discrete compartments of this organelle. The results in this paper demonstrate clearly that p26 is a novel member of the small heat shock/α-crystallin family of proteins. These data, in concert with its restriction to embryos undergoing oviparous development, suggest that p26 functions as a molecular chaperone during exposure to stress, perhaps able to limit protein degradation and thus ensure a ready supply of functional proteins when growth is reinitiated.

Molecular chaperones assist the folding of proteins, protect them from denaturation/aggregation, aid in their renaturation, and influence the final intracellular location of mature proteins (1Schirmer E.C.

The chaperones, many of which are induced by exposure of cells to stress, are divided into several groups, including HSP100, 90, 70, 60 (chaperonin), and small heat shock/α-crystallin proteins. The functions of chaperones differ, but their activities are interrelated and often dependent on association into macromolecular complexes, sometimes consisting of representatives from more than one family. Of most importance to this work are the small heat shock/α-crystallin proteins, 15–30 kDa in size but with the ability to oligomerize into particles of varying monomer number (12Kato K. Hasegawa K.

Upon fertilization, Artemia oocytes undertake one of two developmental pathways. Either they develop directly into free-swimming larvae and are released from the female. In the alternative mode, development is arrested and embryos are discharged from the female as encysted gastrulae, termed cysts (42Clegg J.S. Conte F.P. Persoone G. Sorgeloos P. Roels O. Jaspers E. Brine Shrimp Artemia. Physiology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology. 2. Universa Press, Wetteren, Belgium1980: 11-54Google Scholar). The cysts, composed of about 4000 cells and enclosed in a shell impermeable to most molecules, enter diapause, a condition characterized by an extremely low level of metabolic activity (42Clegg J.S.

Differentiation. 1978; 12: 99-109Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). They are very resistant to environmental insults including anoxia, temperature extremes, organic solvents, γ-irradiation, and desiccation (42Clegg J.S. Conte F.P. Persoone G. Sorgeloos P. Roels O.

Desiccation is a normal part of this path of development and may be required to break diapause and reinitiate development. Resistance to environmental insults is not lost immediately upon resumption of cyst development. For example, fully hydrated, post-gastrula cysts survive at least 4 years under anoxic conditions in a state of quiescence (48Clegg J.S. J. Exp. Zool. 1994; 270: 332-334Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 49Clegg J.S. Jackson S.A. Liang P. MacRae T.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 50Hand S.C.

These animals are essentially ametabolic, apparently existing in the absence of a continuous free energy flow (50Hand S.C. Gnaiger E.

B Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1993; 163: 48-51Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the remarkable stress resistance ofArtemia cysts is poorly understood. However, we previously purified a low molecular weight protein, termed p26, to apparent homogeneity and obtained evidence that it protects embryo cells during encystment, diapause, and anaerobic quiescence (13Liang P. Amons R. MacRae T.H. Clegg J.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 49Clegg J.S. Jackson S.A. Liang P. MacRae T.H. Exp.

Partial sequence analysis, in concert with other characterization, revealed that p26 is a small heat shock/α-crystallin protein with chaperone activity in vitro (13Liang P. Amons R. MacRae T.H. Clegg J.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this paper we report the isolation and sequencing of a full-length cDNA clone for p26. Comparison to other small heat shock/α-crystallin proteins at both primary and secondary levels disclosed novel aspects of p26 structure. Multiple genes for p26 were observed, as were two size classes of mRNA transcripts, one in much greater abundance than the other. Examination of immunofluorescently stained samples with the confocal microscope revealed that a portion of the p26 in hydratedArtemia cysts is found within discrete compartments of their nuclei. We believe that p26 prevents the aggregation of other proteins when these embryos experience stresses of various kinds, thus playing an important role in their growth and development. Encysted embryos ofArtemia franciscana (Great Salt Lake) obtained from Sanders Brine Shrimp, Ogden, UT, were hydrated in cold distilled water for at least 3 h. Those cysts that sank to the bottom of the container were collected by suction on a Buchner funnel, rinsed several times with cold distilled water, and used immediately. Poly(A)+ mRNA, prepared from encystedArtemia gastrulae (54Langdon C.M. Bagshaw J.C. MacRae T.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar), was employed as template for the synthesis of first strand cDNA using the First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit™ (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. PCR 2The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride; BrCN, cyanogen bromide; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. was performed against the first strand cDNA using a degenerative primer, based on the p26 peptide sequence of 103-DEYGHVQR-110 and an oligo(dT) primer, NotI-(dT)18, included in the cDNA synthesis kit. The PCR protocol involved 30 cycles at 92 °C, 30 s; 43 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s in a PTC-100 programmable thermal controller (MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA). A DNA fragment of 378 bp, termed p26-3′, was cloned into PUC18 using the SureClone™ Ligation Kit (Pharmacia) and sequenced manually with the T7 Sequencing™ Kit (Pharmacia) to ensure that it encoded a portion of p26. To obtain the full-length p26 clone, a cDNA library from encysted Artemia gastrulae in λZAP II (a gift from Dr. L. Sastre, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas del C.S.I.C., Madrid, Spain) was converted to the phagemid, Bluescript SK−, and screened with 32P-labeled p26-3′ according to Sambrook et al. (55Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.58Google Scholar). Several putative p26 clones were plaque-purified two times, and one of these contained an insert termed p26-3-6-3 shown by sequencing to encode a full-length cDNA for p26. Purification of p26, digestion, and separation of peptides by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography were as described by Liang et al. (13Liang P. Amons R. MacRae T.H. Clegg J.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The three amino-terminal peptides sequenced in this study were generated by BrCN treatment of p26 (13Liang P. Amons R. MacRae T.H. Clegg J.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As the intact protein was blocked amino-terminally (13Liang P. Amons R. MacRae T.H. Clegg J.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) at least one of the peptides formed should be blocked. This peptide could therefore be identified in high performance liquid chromatograms of the entire BrCN mixture on the basis of its insensitivity toward aminopeptidase M (not shown). Removal of the blocking group if it is an acetyl moiety, together with the first amino acid, is possible with acyl amino acid peptidase. The isolated peptide was lyophilized and dissolved in 10 μl of 0.2 m ammonium carbonate, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mmEDTA (pH 8.5). Deblocking was accomplished by adding 10 μl of acylamino acid peptidase (Boehringer Mannheim), containing 2 μg of lyophilized enzyme, and incubating the mixture for 16 h at 37 °C. The deblocked peptide was loaded on a reversed-phase column (1 × 15 mm) which had been preconditioned by rinsing with 0.5 ml of 0.08% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid containing 75% (v/v) acetonitrile followed by 0.5 ml of 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid. After sample application the column was rinsed with 0.5 ml of 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide was eluted with 75 μl of 75% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid, applied to a Polybrene-impregnated glass fiber disk, and analyzed in a model 475A Applied Biosystems pulse liquid sequencer, connected on line to a Model 120A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. Because it was not possible to prepare a suitable carboxyl-terminal peptide, the final eight amino acids were determined by pool sequencing tryptic peptides obtained from a larger carboxyl-terminal peptide, in turn produced by exposure of p26 to endoproteinase Lys-C (13Liang P. Amons R. MacRae T.H. Clegg J.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The large peptide, beginning at Thr-144, was treated on a Polybrene-impregnated sequence glass fiber disk with 20 μl of 10 mm NaHCO3, followed by 20 μl of acetic anhydride/methanol (1:4, v/v). After 5 min at room temperature the remaining liquid was removed by lyophilization, and the disk was wetted with 20 μl of 0.2 m ammonium carbonate (pH 8.5) containing 0.1 μg of trypsin. The disk was transferred to an Eppendorf tube to suppress evaporation and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The remaining water and ammonium carbonate were removed by lyophilization, and the disk was placed in the sequencer for analysis. Because there were four internal arginine residues in the large peptide, and the amino terminus of the initial peptide was blocked by acetylation, the simultaneous sequencing of four peptides was expected. The secondary structure and solvent accessibility of amino acid residues within p26 were predicted by the methods of Rost and Sander via the Predict Protein E-mail server at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, as described by Casperset al. (16Caspers G.-J. Leunissen J.A.M. de Jong W.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). DNA was prepared from Artemia larvae as described previously except that ethanol precipitation was avoided (54Langdon C.M. Bagshaw J.C. MacRae T.H. Eur. J.

The DNA was digested withBamHI, electrophoresed in 0.8% agarose gels with 28 μg of DNA in each lane, and blotted to Hybond™-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Corp.) in 10 × SSC (1.5 m NaCl, 0.15 msodium citrate (pH 7.0)). The blots were incubated for 12 h at 68 °C in prehybridization solution that contained 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon DNA which had been sheared and denatured. Hybridization was in the same solution for 12 h at 68 °C with DNA fragments corresponding to the full-length p26 cDNA (p26-3-6-3), 373 bp from the 5′-end (p26-5′), and 378 bp from the 3′-end (p26-3′). The full-length probe was recovered from agarose gels after incubation of the plasmid containing p26-3-6-3 with EcoRI and XhoI followed by electrophoresis. The probe, p26-5′, was generated by PCR amplification of p26-3-6-3 using a nondegenerate primer based on nucleotides 22–39 of p26-3-6-3 and a degenerate primer based on the peptide sequence, 119-PEHVKPE-126. p26-3′ was produced as described previously in this paper. The 5′- and 3′-probes had a short sequence overlap, but as revealed by the hybridization patterns, this did not appear to affect their specificity. The hybridization probes were labeled with32P by random priming (T7 Quick Prime™ Kit, Pharmacia) following the manufacturer's instructions. After hybridization the blots were washed with 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min, followed by 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and then 0.1 × SSC with 0.1% SDS, both at 68 °C for 15 min, partly air dried, wrapped in Saran Wrap™ and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT™ AR film (Picker Scientific, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia) at −70 °C. The number of p26 genes in the Artemia genome was determined by hybridizing the 32P-labeled probes just described to Southern blots that contained known amounts of both p26 cDNA and restriction-digested Artemia DNA in parallel lanes. For this quantitation the size of the Artemia haploid genome was set at 1.37 × 106 kb (1.45 pg) (56Roberts M.P. Vaughn J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 697: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the size of the Bluescript Sk− plasmid containing p26-3-6-3, which was linearized by digestion with XhoI before electrophoresis, was 3.64 kb (3.7 × 10−6 pg). Labeling intensities for bands in each sample were compared by scanning blots with a Bio-Rad GS-670 Imaging Densitometer and quantitated by use of Molecular Analyst software from Bio-Rad. Poly(A)+ mRNA was obtained from hydratedArtemia cysts, electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels, blotted to Hybond™-N+ membranes, baked at 80 °C for 2 h, and hybridized to 32P-labeled, full-length p26 cDNA as described by Langdon et al. (54Langdon C.M. Bagshaw J.C. MacRae T.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar), except that probes were prepared by random priming. Size determinations were made by comparing migration distances of p26 mRNA with RNA fragments of known size in a 0.24–9.5-kb RNA ladder from Life Technologies (Burlington, Ontario). Nuclei were prepared fromArtemia for immunofluorescent staining by two methods. In the first procedure hydrated cysts were crushed gently between two glass slides, one of which was coated with poly-l-lysine. The slides were separated and the nuclei were fixed immediately. Nuclei were also isolated by a modification of the technique of Squires and Acey (57Squires S.L. Acey R.A. Warner A.H. MacRae T.H. Bagshaw J.C. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Artemia Development. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 221Google Scholar) communicated to us by J. Vaughn (University of Miami, Miami, OH). Briefly, 10 g of hydrated Artemia cysts were ground by hand in a chilled mortar and pestle for 2 min in 35 ml of HPC buffer (0.5 m hexylene glycol, 0.05 mPipes-free acid, 1 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.6)) and then subjected to one passage in a motorized Dounce homogenizer fitted with a size A pestle. The homogenate was passed through one layer of Miracloth (Calbiochem), centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was rinsed once with HPC buffer and then washed two times using 40 ml of HPC buffer for each wash. The large, greenish pellet of nuclei obtained after the second wash was resuspended in 17.5 ml of HPC buffer with a Pasteur pipette. The suspension was layered on a 25-ml cushion of 75% (v/v) Percoll in 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman JS-13 swinging bucket rotor. The top clear layer was discarded, and the second layer was transferred to a fresh tube and brought to a final volume of 10–15 ml with HPC. The solution was applied to a 25-ml cushion of 75% (v/v) Percoll that had been centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman JS-13 rotor, and the centrifugation was repeated. The top layer was discarded and the second layer of 5 to 6 ml was mixed in a fresh tube with an equal volume of HPC buffer before centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting yellow-brown pellets, containing isolated nuclei, were resuspended in 1.0 ml of HPC buffer. The isolation was also done with all solutions at pH 6.5 to ensure that p26 was not extracted from nuclei during their manipulation under basic conditions (49Clegg J.S. Jackson S.A. Liang P. MacRae T.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 53Clegg J.S. Jackson S.A. Warner A.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Nuclei were mixed with an equal volume of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride (DAPI) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 0.001 μg/ml in H2O for 5 min at room temperature, allowed to settle onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides for 5 min at room temperature, and examined by light and immunofluorescent m"

Conversely, CDK4 activity is inhibited when it is bound to the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p16 INK4A. To investigate the molecular basis of the interactions between CDK4 and cyclin D1 or p16 INK4A we performed site-directed mutagenesis of CDK4. The interaction was examined using in vitro translated wild type and mutant CDK4 proteins and bacterially expressed cyclin D1 and p16 fusion proteins. As mutational analysis of CDC2 suggests that its cyclin binding domain is primarily located near its amino terminus, the majority of the mutations constructed in CDK4 were located near its amino terminus. In addition, CDK4 residues homologous to CDC2 sites involved in Suc1 binding were also mutated. Our analysis indicates that cyclin D1 and p16 binding sites are overlapping and located primarily near the amino terminus. All CDK4 mutations that resulted in decreased p16 binding capability also diminished cyclin D1 binding. In contrast, amino-terminal sequences were identified, including the PSTAIRE region, that are important for cyclin D1 binding but are not involved in p16 binding.

The eukaryotic cell cycle is controlled by a series of regulatory “checkpoints,” two of which occur at the G1/S and G2/M phase transitions. The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CKI, CDK inhibitor; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; Stag, S-tagged; RB, retinoblastoma. are key regulators of these checkpoints (1Nurse P.

Cell. 1994; 79: 557-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The CDKs are serine/threonine protein kinases that are composed of a catalytic CDK subunit and a regulatory cyclin subunit. Compelling evidence suggests that D-type cyclins and their major catalytic partners, CDK4 and CDK6, are key regulators of the G1/S phase checkpoint. Cyclin D-CDK holoenzymes accumulate when resting cells are stimulated to proliferate by addition of growth factors. Their associated kinase activities are first detected in mid G1 phase and increase as cells approach the G1/S boundary (5Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 6Meyerson M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2077-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Removal of growth factors early in the G1 phase results in rapid decay of cyclin D-CDK activity and correlates with failure of the cells to enter the S phase. Removal of growth factors in late G1 also results in decay of cyclin D-CDK activity; however, it does not inhibit progression through the cell cycle (7Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microinjection of cyclin D1 antibodies into cells during G1 prevents entry into S phase whereas injections at or after S phase have no effect (8Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.-Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar, 9Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote P. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Thus, cyclin D-CDK complexes are essential for the G1 to S phase transition. Activation of individual CDKs is dictated in part by the temporal expression of their cognate cyclins and by stage-specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events (10Pines J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 305-313PubMed Google Scholar). An additional layer of CDK regulation has emerged with the discovery of the CDK inhibitor proteins (CKIs) p15 (11Kamb A. Gruis N.A.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Binding of these inhibitory proteins to specific CDKs or specific CDK-cyclin complexes inhibits kinase activity and thus blocks cell cycle progression. The human p16 INK4A/MTS1/CDKN2 (hereafter referred to as p16) gene encodes a 16-kDa nuclear protein that binds to and inhibits the catalytic activity of CDK4 and CDK6 (13Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar). Loss of functional p16 is associated with deregulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (18Hunter T. Pines J. Cell. 1994; 79: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). Whereas this finding serves to emphasize the critical role p16 plays in regulating cell growth, the molecular mechanism by which it inhibits CDK4 or CDK6 kinase activity is unknown. Thus, to identify the regions of CDK4 required for p16 and cyclin D1 binding, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of CDK4. The data from our protein interaction studies indicate that the p16 and cyclin D1 binding sites of CDK4 are overlapping but not identical and support the hypothesis that p16 competes with cyclin D1 for binding to CDK4. Cyclin D1 cDNA (kindly provided by E. Harlow) was cloned as a BamHI fragment in the pET29a vector (Novagen) to allow production of an Stag-cyclin D1 fusion protein. BL21 cells containing pET29-cyclin D1 were grown to anA 595 of 0.4, and protein expression was induced for 4 h with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc), and lysed by sonication. The insoluble protein fraction, which contains the Stag-cyclin D1 fusion protein, was isolated by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman Type 45 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 followed by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of DNase buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml DNase I, 10 μg/ml RNase A) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The insoluble protein was precipitated again by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of Tris buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA) containing 6 m urea, and spun at 30,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman Type 45 rotor. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and solubilized protein was diluted dropwise to a final concentration of 150 μg/ml in 2 m urea. The protein was dialyzed for 24 h against 50 volumes of storage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol). The dialysis buffer was changed, and dialysis continued for an additional 24 h. The protein was sized on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, stained with Coomassie Blue, and shown to be >90% pure. CDK4 cDNA (kindly provided by E. Harlow) was cloned as aBamHI fragment into pBMS1 (19Spana C. O'Rourke E.C. Bolen J.B. Fargnoli J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1993; 4: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to allow production of GST-CDK4 fusion protein in Sf9 cells. A 500-ml Sf9 culture (1 × 106 cells/ml) in Sf-900 II SFM medium was infected at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and harvested 48 h after infection by centrifugation at 1500 rpm in a Beckman J6-M2 centrifuge. The cells were resuspended in 100 ml of GST buffer (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4) containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mg/ml Pefabloc. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman Type 45 rotor. The Sf9 cellular lysate containing the GST-CDK4 protein was added to 10 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads. Unbound material was removed by washing with GST buffer. Bound protein was eluted from the column with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 mmglutathione. Fractions containing the GST-CDK4 protein were pooled. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 100 volumes of storage buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmMgCl2, 25% glycerol). p16 cDNA was cloned as a BamHI fragment in the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to allow production of a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli DH5α cells. To isolate the GST-p16 fusion protein, a 500-ml culture of DH5α cells containing pGEX-p16 was grown to an A 595 of 0.4, and protein expression was induced for 3 h with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia) as described above. p16 cDNA was also cloned as a BamHI fragment into pET29a+ (Novagen). This construct produces an S-tagged p16 fusion protein. The Stag-p16 protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions and subsequently cleaved with thrombin to produce untagged protein. The carboxyl-terminal end of the retinoblastoma open reading frame (base pairs 2564–2922) was cloned as a BamHI fragment in the pGEX-4T vector (Pharmacia) to allow production of GST-RB fusion protein in E. coli DH5α cells. The GST-RB fusion protein was purified as described above. [35S]Methionine-labeled CDK4 proteins were translatedin vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates using the Promega TnT transcription and translation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human CDK4 cDNA was cloned into pALTER-1 (Promega). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites II in vitroMutagenesis Systems kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clones containing the appropriate mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Wild type and mutant CDK4 proteins were produced by translation in reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine. Identical amounts of wild type or mutant CDK4 proteins were added to 700 μl of TTBS buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 5 μg of either Stag-cyclin D1 or GST-p16 fusion protein. The reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle rocking. 20 μl of S-protein-agarose (Novagen) or glutathione-Sepharose beads (pre-equilibrated with TTBS buffer) were added to the cyclin D1 and p16 binding assays, respectively. The reactions were incubated with gentle rocking at 4 °C for an additional hour. Bound proteins were precipitated by centrifugation and washed 3 times with TTBS buffer at 4 °C. CDK4 protein was eluted by boiling the beads in 40 μl of 3 × loading buffer. Proteins were sized on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, quantitated using the Fuji BAS1000 PhosphorImager, and visualized by autoradiography. The kinase reactions contained 300 ng of GST-CDK4, 300 ng of Stag-cyclin D1, and 500 ng of GST-RB in 25 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm EGTA, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 25 μm ATP). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose was then added, and the reactions were incubated 20 min on ice. The beads were isolated by centrifugation and washed 2 times with GST buffer. They were then boiled in 20 μl of loading buffer. The phosphorylated GST-RB was sized on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, quantitated using the Fuji BAS1000 PhosphorImager, and visualized by autoradiography. Inhibition of CDK4 kinase activity by p16 protein was examined using a filter binding assay. The reaction was performed as described above with the following modifications. p16 protein was added to each kinase reaction at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 3. After 1 h of incubation at 30 °C the reaction was stopped by the addition of cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 15% and incubated on ice for 20 min. The reaction was harvested onto GF/C unifilter plates (Packard Instrument Co.) using a Packard Universal harvester, and the filters were counted on a Packard TopCount 96-well liquid scintillation counter.Figure 3Inhibition of CDK4 kinase activity by addition of p16. RB kinase activity for wild type GST-CDK4 (•), GST-CDK4-MUT3B (▴), and GST-CDK4-MUT5 (○) proteins was measured using a filter binding assay. A titration of increasing concentrations of p16 protein was performed for each kinase, and the percent inhibition was determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify the region(s) of CDK4 involved in the interaction with cyclin D1 and p16 we generated a collection of mutants by site-directed mutagenesis. Alanine residues were substituted for charged amino acids, a strategy that allows the evaluation of the functional significance of charged residues in a given protein. Charged-to-alanine mutagenesis has been used successfully for the identification of protein-protein interaction domains (20Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 21Goubin F. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2281-2287PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ashkenazi A. Presta L.G. Marsters S.A.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5122-5131Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). By this method, charged residues (Asp (D), Arg (R), Glu (E), His (H), and Lys (K)) were changed either singularly or in clusters to Ala (A). In addition, as phosphorylation is known to regulate CDK4 activity (26Kato J.-Y. Matsuoka M. Strom D.K. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2713-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 27Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Jinno S. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 376: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), Tyr-17 and Thr-172 were also mutated because these residues have been identified as phosphoacceptor sites. Finally, all CDK family members contain a glycine residue (i.e. CDK2 Gly-43) immediately preceding the PSTAIRE motif. Crystallographic analysis has shown that this glycine residue is critical for cyclin A binding in that it allows proper folding of the PSTAIRE motif (28Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Compared with other CDKs, CDK4 is unique in that it contains 7 glycines (residues 42–48) at this position and is the only CDK family member that is devoid of charged residues in this region. To assess the functional significance of this region in CDK4, 3 of the 7 glycine residues were deleted. The high degree of sequence similarity shared between CDK family members suggests that CDK proteins have similar structures. In support of this hypothesis, crystallographic analysis has demonstrated that the cAPK catalytic subunit and CDK2 share remarkable structural similarity even though the two proteins are only distantly related at the amino acid level (29De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The backbone structures of both proteins can be divided into two lobes, a smaller amino-terminal lobe and a larger carboxyl-terminal lobe. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that CDK4, like CDK2, is bilobal. All 22 charged residues in the putative amino-terminal lobe of CDK4 (amino acids 1–86) were mutated. In addition, 10 charged residues in the putative carboxyl-terminal lobe were targeted; residues Lys-88, Glu-94, and His-95 were targeted due to their close proximity to the putative amino-terminal lobe, and 7 additional charged residues were targeted because they are homologous to CDC2 sequences involved in Suc1 binding. As our CDK4 mutants were made prior to the publication of the crystal structure of the closely related CDK2-cyclin A complex (28Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), the choice of sites to be mutagenized was not influenced by this study. The name of each mutant and the amino acids substituted are listed in Table I. To examine interactions between the mutant CDK4 proteins and cyclin D1, radiolabeled CDK4 protein was expressed in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Identical amounts of wild type or mutant CDK4 proteins were incubated with bacterially expressed Stag-cyclin D1 fusion protein. Protein complexes were precipitated using S-protein-agarose beads and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The in vitrotranslated protein bound to cyclin D1 was quantitated using a Fuji BAS1000 PhosphorImager. The level of interaction for each mutant CDK4 protein was measured relative to the quantity of wild type CDK4 precipitated. Fig. 1 A shows an example of a CDK4-cyclin D1 interaction assay. In these assays, approximately 30% of the wild type CDK4 protein was precipitated by cyclin D1 whereas no CDK4 protein was precipitated when Stag-cyclin D1 fusion protein was omitted from the assay (data not shown). Each binding assay was performed five to seven times, and the average binding capacity for each mutant is summarized in Table I. In the putative amino-terminal lobe, CDK4-MUT3, -MUT6, -MUT7, -MUT8, -MUT9, -MUT10, and -MUT13 significantly decreased cyclin binding to less than 50% of wild type levels. The most dramatic effect on cyclin D1 binding was observed for CDK4-MUT3 (residues 22–25), which decreased cyclin D1 binding to 10% relative to wild type. This region includes the site of a CDK4 mutation (R24C) present in a human melanoma (30Wolfel T. Hauer M. Schneider J. Serrano M. Wolfel C. Klehmann-Hieb E. De Plaen E.

CDK4-R24C contains a cysteine residue in place of the arginine residue at position 24 and was identified as a tumor-specific antigen recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes. The CDK4-R24C mutant, however, was reported to bind cyclin D1 as well as wild type CDK4. To investigate the involvement of the individual amino acids of the MUT3 region in cyclin D1 binding, single amino acid substitutions were made. CDK4-MUT3A (K22A) bound cyclin D1 as poorly as the triple mutant (15%), CDK4-MUT3B (R24A) bound slightly more cyclin D1 (30%), and CDK4-MUT3C (D25A) bound cyclin D1 almost as well as wild type (80%). Thus, Lys-22 appears to play a greater role in cyclin D1 binding. The sequence of the CDK4-MUT3 region (Lys-Ala-Arg-Asp) is identical for CDK4 and CDK6, the major catalytic partners of the D-type cyclins. In contrast, the corresponding regions in CDK2 (Lys-Ala-Arg-Asn), CDK3 (Lys-Ala-Lys-Asn), and CDK5 (Lys-Ala-Lys-Asn) all contain an asparagine residue in place of the aspartic acid present at residue 25 of CDK4. To determine if substitution of Asn for Asp at position 25 affected the affinity of CDK4 for cyclin D1, CDK4-MUT3E (D25N) was constructed. As a control, Asp-25 was also mutated to glutamic acid (CDK4-MUT3D). Like the D25A mutation, D25N and D25E bound cyclin D1 almost as efficiently as wild type CDK4. Thus, Asp-25 does not appear to be involved in cyclin D1 binding.Table ICyclin D1 and p16 binding activities of CDK4 mutantsMutant name1-aThe numbering of mutants is as in Fig. 1.Mutation% Binding1-bNormalized to a value of 100% binding in the wild type (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab The PSTAIRE regions of CDK1 and CDK2 play a critical role in cyclin binding (23Ducommun B. Brambilla P. Felix M.-A. Franza Jr., B.R. Karsenti E. Draetta G.

Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Mutation of this region in CDK4 (CDK4-MUT7) decreases cyclin D1 binding by 85% relative to wild type. In addition, residues that are proximal to the amino and carboxyl terminus of the PSTAIRE motif also contribute to cyclin D1 binding. CDK4 Lys-35, which is located 15 amino acids proximal to the amino terminus of the PSTAIRE motif, has been shown by sequence alignment of 65 protein kinases to be an invariant lysine within the catalytic domain (31Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar) and appears to be directly involved in the phosphotransfer reaction (32Kamps M.P. Sefton B., M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Replacement of Lys-35 with Ala (CDK4-MUT6) decreased cyclin D1 binding to 45% of wild type. The K35A,R38A double mutant shows similar cyclin D1 binding relative to CDK4-MUT6 (K35A; data not shown). Three of the five amino-terminal cluster mutations located proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the PSTAIRE motif (CDK4-MUT8, -MUT9, and -MUT10) decreased cyclin D1 binding by greater than 50%. Of the three regions, CDK4-MUT8 displayed the greatest reduction in cyclin D1 binding (25%). Seven regions were mutated in the putative carboxyl-terminal lobe of CDK4. Mutation of the activating Thr at position 172 (CDK4-T172A) had no detectable effect on cyclin D1 binding. However, two mutants, CDK4-MUT14 and CDK4-MUT17, displayed significant reductions in cyclin D1 binding (10% of wild type). CDK4-MUT14 contains a mutation of the consensus triplet Ala-Pro-Glu (residues 182–184), a conserved feature of protein kinase catalytic domains (31Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar). Mutation of this region eliminates virtually all cyclin D1 binding. The region mutated in CDK4-MUT17 (residues 281–283) is located 20 amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal end of CDK4; mutations in the homologous region of CDC2 dramatically decrease Suc1 binding activity (24Ducommun B. Brambilla P. Draetta G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6177-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but not cyclin A binding (23Ducommun B. Brambilla P. Felix M.-A. Franza Jr., B.R. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3311-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In CDK4, however, the CDK4-MUT14 mutant displayed a dramatic decrease in cyclin D1 binding. p16 was initially identified as a CDK4-binding protein and found to be a specific inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 (13Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3392) Google Scholar). The regions of CDK4 involved in p16 binding were determined using our set of mutant CDK4 proteins. The CDK4-p16 binding assays were performed as described for the cyclin D1 binding assays except that p16 was expressed in bacteria as a GST-p16 fusion protein; therefore, protein complexes were precipitated using glutathione-linked Sepharose beads. Fig.1 B shows an example of a CDK4-p16 interaction assay. In these assays, approximately 60% of the wild type CDK4 protein was precipitated by GST-p16 whereas no binding was detected when GST was used in the assay (data not shown). Each binding assay was performed five to seven times, and the average binding capacity for each mutant is summarized in Table I. Mutations in six regions of CDK4 decreased p16 binding by greater than 50%; four of these regions (CDK4-MUT2, -MUT3, -MUT6, and -MUT8) are located in the putative amino-terminal lobe, and two regions (CDK4-MUT14 and -MUT17) are located near the carboxyl terminus. Interestingly, mutations within the PSTAIRE homology region (CDK4-MUT7) did not affect p16 binding. Of the amino-terminal mutants, CDK4-MUT3 displayed the most dramatic reduction in p16 binding (2% of wild type). Within this region, residues Lys-22 (CDK4-MUT3A) and Arg-24 (CDK4-MUT3B) play key roles in p16 binding whereas Asp-25 appears to contribute little to the binding. The two carboxyl-terminal mutants, CDK4-MUT14 and -MUT17, displayed dramatic reductions in p16 binding (90 and 95% relative to wild type, respectively). Mutations in three regions (CDK4-MUT12, -Y17F, and T172A) resulted in a 2-fold increase in p16 binding. To validate the protein interaction assays, we examined the RB kinase activity of a subset of the CDK4 mutants. Wild type and mutant CDK4 proteins were expressed as GST-fusion proteins using a baculovirus expression system and were affinity purified. Each CDK4 protein was incubated with cyclin D1, and the kinase activity of the complexes was measured using the retinoblastoma protein as substrate (Fig.2 A). CDK4-MUT2, -MUTY17F, and -MUT5, which efficiently bind cyclin D1, possess RB kinase activities that are comparable to wild type. In contrast, mutants that displayed a greater than 80% reduction in cyclin D1 binding activity (CDK4-MUT3, -MUT7, and -MUT14) lacked appreciable RB kinase activity. Three mutants, CDK4-MUT3B, -MUT8, and -MUT10, which displayed 25–40% of cyclin binding activity, retained at least 20% of wild type RB kinase activity (Fig. 2 B). As expected, CDK4-MUT6, in which the catalytic lysine at position 35 is replaced with alanine, lacks detectable RB kinase activity even though it retains 45% of cyclin D1 binding activity. Likewise, CDK4-T172A, in which the activating threonine residue at position 172 is replaced with alanine, binds cyclin D1 efficiently but does not phosphorylate RB. The mutant CDK4-MUT3B (R24A) is particularly interesting in that a similar CDK4 mutation, R24C, has been identified in a primary human melanoma (30Wolfel T. Hauer M. Schneider J. Serrano M. Wolfel C.

Deletion analysis of ∼5500 base pairs of the human 24(OH)ase promoter showed that the sequence between −316 and −142 contained the information necessary and sufficient for retinoid-induced activation of the promoter.

Both receptor subfamilies are thought to mediate the biological actions of retinoids in processes such as cellular growth and differentiation and development by altering the production of certain proteins in various cells at the level of gene transcription (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

The ligand-occupied receptors generally act by binding to retinoid receptor-responsive elements in the promoter regions of target genes. Ligand-bound RAR cooperates with RXR to form a heterodimer that is an efficient and high affinity binder of retinoic acid response elements, thereby activating transcription of certain tRA-responsive genes such as RARβ (7de The H.

RXR has been shown to act as a silent (nonliganded) partner with a number of other intracellular receptors, including RAR, vitamin D receptor (VDR), and thyroid hormone receptor, in response to their respective ligands (11Bugge T.H.

However, evidence for RXR homodimers as functional units in the transcription of biologically relevant target genes has yet to be demonstrated. For example, while RXR binds to, and stimulates transcription from, an element within the cellular retinol binding protein II gene promoter in cotransactivation assays in mammalian cells (18Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26625-26633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this gene has not been shown to be regulated by retinoids in nontransfected cells or in the animal. However, evidence is emerging that RXR may not function solely as a silent partner in hormone signaling pathways. Recently, 9cRA has been shown to activate RXR in heterodimeric interactions with two orphan receptors, LXR (19Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) and NGFI-B (20Perlmann T. Jansson L. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 769-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), to stimulate transcription from synthetic response elements in cotransfections assays. Additionally, RXR ligands have been shown to increase the effects of RAR ligands to induce certain RNA species (21Roy B. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6481-6487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, however, while an RXR ligand modulated the effects of an RAR ligand to activate certain genes, the RXR ligand alone did not induce RNA levels. We show here that an RXR-selective ligand alone is able to activate transcription of the human 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-24-hydroxylase (24(OH)ase) promoter by binding to the RXR partner of RXR·VDR or RXR·RAR heterodimers and acting through previously defined VDRE sequences (22Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 23Pike J.W. Kerner S.A. Jin C.H. Allegretto E.A. Elgort M.G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: S144Google Scholar) within the promoter. Either the RXR ligand alone or the VDR ligand alone leads to stimulation of the promoter, while the presence of both ligands leads to additive or more than additive induction of luciferase activity. These data indicate that ligand occupation of either or both heterodimeric receptor partners leads to a productive transcriptional event at this promoter, with maximal induction observed upon occupation of both receptors. Additionally, ligand-occupied RAR also activates this promoter through these sequences by binding with RXR, either with or with its ligand. Therefore, these two previously defined VDREs within the human 24(OH)ase promoter can also serve as retinoic acid response elements, since they are able to confer responsiveness of the promoter to retinoids.

PCR products were digested with SalI (or used blunt-ended) and NsiI and subcloned into pLUCpl digested with XhoI (blunted or not) at the 5′ end and PstI at the 3′ end. (−261Δ1)-LUC (−168CCC mutated to GTT) was created by site-specific oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the (−261 to −22) PCR product in M13, digested with SalI andNsiI, and subcloned into pLUCpl cut with XhoI andPstI. (−316Δ1)-LUC (−168CCC mutated toGTT) was made by digestion of (−316 to −22)-LUC withHindIII/BstEII, digestion of (−261Δ1)-LUC withBstEII/BamHI, and ligation of the two fragments into pLUCpl digested with HindIII/BamHI. (−316Δ2)-LUC (−289CACC to AAAA) was created utilizing the MORPH™ site-specific plasmid DNA mutagenesis kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). (−316Δ1Δ2)-LUC (−168CCC to GTT and−289CACC to AAAA) was generated by digestion of (−316Δ2)-LUC with HindIII/BstEII and (−261Δ1)-LUC with BstEII/BamHI and combining the two fragments in pLUCpl digested withHindIII/BamHI. (−316Δ3)-LUC (−308GGGAGGCGCGTTCG mutated toAGAAGGCGCAAATT) was generated by using PCR; the 5′ primer contained the individual base changes as well as an XhoI site immediately upstream of position −316, and the 3′ primer contained the NsiI site at −22. The resultant PCR product was digested with XhoI and NsiI and subcloned into pLUCpl digested with XhoI/PstI. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the individual VDREs (−294 to −274 and −174 to −151) were synthesized with HindIII ends, annealed, and subcloned into the ΔMTV-LUC vector. The identities of all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Receptor and reporter vectors were transfected along with carrier DNA and β-galactosidase internal control plasmid in COS-1 cells by the use of calcium phosphate andN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethane-sulfonic acid-buffered saline. Briefly, transfections were performed in triplicate in 12-well plates with a total of 20 μg/ml DNA (0–0.5 μg of receptor expression vector, 5–10 μg of reporter plasmid, 5 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid, and pGEM carrier plasmid to a total of 20 μg). Amounts of plasmids transfected in each experiment are listed in individual figure legends. Fifteen hours later, ligands were added, followed by an additional 30-h incubation. Cells were lysed, and measurements of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were as described previously (4Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). Luciferase values were normalized with β-galactosidase values to control for variable transfection efficiencies. -Fold induction was calculated by dividing the maximal response by the response elicited with vehicle. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance and Fisher's protected least squares determination. Oligonucleotides (−294 to −274 with BamHI and HindIII sites at each end and −174 to −151 with HindIII ends) and a PCR fragment (−314 to −121) spanning the retinoid and 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive region of the human 24(OH)ase promoter were synthesized. Oligonucleotides containing a consensus DR3 sequence (GGGAGGTCATTTAGGTCAGGG) or a DR1 motif (AGGTCAGAGGTCA) were synthesized with HindIII, or SalI overhanging ends, respectively. The oligonucleotides and PCR fragment were end-labeled with 32P-labeled nucleotide triphosphates. Protein extracts were prepared from the yeast strain BJ2168 transformed without or with VDR, RXRα, or RARα expression vectors (2Allegretto E.A. McClurg M.R. Lazarchik S.B. Clemm D.L. Kerner S.A.

Reactions performed with ligand present included 9cRA (1 μm, 0.1% ethanol) or ethanol vehicle and RXR-containing extracts; incubation was at 4 °C for 1 h prior to the DNA addition. Protein-DNA binding reactions were carried out in buffer containing 50–100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 12.5 mm MgCl2. Oligonucleotide probe (∼20,000 dpm) was added to protein mixtures along with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) competitor DNA/reaction and incubated on ice for 20 min, followed by 2 min at room temperature. Electrophoresis of protein-DNA complexes was performed on 6% acrylamide, 0.5 × TBE gels (Novex, San Diego) in 0.5 × TBE running buffer at 4 °C (∼15 mA). Gels were dried and exposed to autoradiographic film for 1–2 h at −80 °C. CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells at ∼40% confluency were incubated in media containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum for 48 h prior to treatment with ligands. Cells were ∼80% confluent upon the addition of ligands in 0.1% ethanol vehicle. 1,25(OH)2D3, LG100268, TTNPB, 9cRA, or combinations thereof were added in fresh media containing charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and incubated with cells for 6 h prior to harvest. Concentrations of ligands are indicated in the figure legends. Total cellular RNA was extracted, and Northern analysis was performed as per standard methodology. Probes included a 900-base pair EcoRI/XbaI DNA fragment of the rat 24(OH)ase cDNA (30Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and a 1.4-kb human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fragment (Clonetech). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C in Quik-Hyb solution (Amersham Corp.) for 2 h followed by washing (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 1 h). Quantitation was by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Two regions of the human 24(OH)ase promoter are responsive to retinoids and 1,25(OH)2D3. The cloning of the rat (31Ohyama Y. Ozono K.

Two VDREs have been defined within both the rat and the human promoters that confer responsiveness of the promoters to 1,25(OH)2D3 (22Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23906-23909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and cursory experiments indicated that the human 24(OH)ase promoter was stimulated by retinoids in CV-1 cell cotransactivation assays (27Allegretto E.A.

Thein vivo effects were observed with a synthetic RXR-selective ligand, LG100268 (24Boehm M.F. Zhang L. Zhi L. McClurg M.R. Berger E. Wagoner M. Mais D.E. Suto C.M. Davies P.J.A. Heyman R.A.

To determine the mechanism of retinoid activation of the 24(OH)ase promoter, an in depth promoter study was undertaken. Various deletions of the previously cloned ∼6-kb human 24(OH)ase promoter (23Pike J.W. Kerner S.A. Jin C.H. Allegretto E.A. Elgort M.G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: S144Google Scholar) were constructed into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector (2Allegretto E.A. McClurg M.R. Lazarchik S.B. Clemm D.L. Kerner S.A. Elgort M.G. Boehm M.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26625-26633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tested for the ability to respond to various ligands in kidney cell lines cotransfected with retinoid receptors and/or VDR. The promoter fragment containing ∼5.5 kb upstream of the start site of transcription ((−5500 to −22)-LUC) yielded 3-fold induction of luciferase activity by the RXR-selective ligand, LG100268, in either of two kidney cell lines, CV-1 (data not shown) or COS-1 (Fig. 1 A). COS-1 cells were used for the remainder of the study, since they gave identical results to CV-1 cells and were more stable in the transfection assays than CV-1 cells. The magnitude of the response (∼3-fold) to LG100268 with (−5500 to −22)-LUC was identical to that previously observed by us in the mouse (27Allegretto E.A. Shevde N. Zou A. Howell S.R. Boehm M.F. Hollis B.W. Pike J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23906-23909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and was also identical to that observed with (−1177 to −22)-LUC and (−316 to −22)-LUC. (−261 to −22)-LUC yielded a less efficacious response (∼1.8-fold activation; p < 0.05) with LG100268, and (−143 to −22)-LUC and pLUCpl did not respond to LG100268 (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, two regions within the promoter conferred responsiveness to the RXR-selective ligand LG100268, one between −316 and −261 and the other between −261 and −143 (see Fig. 2). Interestingly, these two regions are also responsive to 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 1 B) and contain previously defined VDREs (see Fig. 2; Refs. 21Roy B. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6481-6487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 22Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Sequence upstream of −1177 may contain an additional VDRE (Fig.1 B). The two LG100268-responsive regions also confer responsiveness of the promoter to TTNPB (Fig. 1 C;p < 0.05) and to 9cRA treatment (Fig. 1 D). COS-1 cells contain endogenous VDR, RAR, and RXR proteins (data not shown), and ligand-induced luciferase activity driven by the 24(OH)ase promoter sequences was also observed without transfected receptor expression vectors. The -fold induction varied from 20 to 80% of that in the presence of transfected receptors, depending on the ligand (Fig.3). The endogenous retinoid receptor pan-agonist, 9cRA, elicited greater induction of luciferase activity through each of the promoter constructs both in the presence (∼6-fold; Fig.1 D) and in the absence (∼3-fold; Fig. 3) of transfected receptors, than either TTNPB or LG100268 alone, implying that occupancy of both RAR and RXR leads to greater activation of the promoter than either individual liganded retinoid receptor.Figure 1Transactivational analysis of 5′ deletion mutant human 24(OH)ase promoter sequences. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with RXRγ (A), VDR (B), RARγ (C), or RARγ and RXRγ (D) expression vectors (0.5 μg) along with reporter vectors (10 μg) driven by human 24(OH)ase promoter sequences ranging from −5500 to −143 base pair at the 5′ terminus to −22 at the 3′ end (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cells were treated with vehicle (open bars) or increasing concentrations (10−10m, 10−8m, 10−6m(A) or 10−9m, 10−7m, 10−5m (B,C, and D) of the following ligands delivered in ethanol vehicle: LG100268 (A), 1,25(OH)2D3 (B), TTNPB (C), and 9cRA (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Human 24(OH)ase promoter sequence.

It was previously demonstrated that RXR·VDR heterodimers could bind to these regions (22Chen K.S. DeLuca H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 23Pike J.W. Kerner S.A. Jin C.H. Allegretto E.A. Elgort M.G. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: S144Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized spanning the regions from −294 to −274 and from −174 to −151. Wild type nontransformed yeast extracts did not display DNA binding activity via either of these sequences (Fig. 4, A–C). Extracts from yeast transformed with a human RXRα expression vector (2Allegretto E.A. McClurg M.R. Lazarchik S.B. Clemm D.L. Kerner S.A. Elgort M.G. Boehm M.F. White S.K. Pike J.W. Heyman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26625-26633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were able to bind to each of these sequences in the presence of extracts from yeast expressing human VDR or human RARα (Fig. 4, A–C) or human RARγ (data not shown). However, RXR did not bind alone to these sequences (Fig. 4, A–C) or to the entire responsive region between −314 and −121 (Fig. 4 D) in the absence or presence of 9cRA (Fig. 4 D and data not shown). Conversely, RXR was able to bind to an oligonucleotide containing a consensus direct repeat separated by 1 base pair (DR1) (Fig. 4 D), as previously shown (17Zhang X. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 18Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that RXR is unable to bind as a homodimer to the retinoid-responsive elements of the 24(OH)ase promoter but that it does form heterodimers with either VDR or RAR. Also, VDR alone or RAR alone or the combination of the two receptors did not bind to any of the DNA probes (Fig. 4, A–C, and data not shown). Binding of RXR·RAR heterodimers to the human 24(OH)ase VDRE sequences was surprising in that the DR3 motifs that they contain are thought to bind preferentially to RXR·VDR heterodimers, while RXR·RAR heterodimers have been shown to prefer DR2 and DR5 type motifs (33Umesono K.

https://openalex.org/W1976497644,"Calcium deposition diseases caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) and basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals are a significant source of morbidity in the elderly. We have shown previously that both types of crystals can induce mitogenesis, as well as metalloproteinase synthesis and secretion by fibroblasts and chondrocytes. These responses may promote degradation of articular tissues. We have also shown previously that both CPPD and BCP crystals activate expression of the c-<i>fos</i>and c-<i>jun</i> proto-oncogenes. Phosphocitrate (PC) can specifically block mitogenesis and proto-oncogene expression induced by either BCP or CPPD crystals in 3T3 cells and human fibroblasts, suggesting that PC may be an effective therapy for calcium deposition diseases. To understand how PC inhibits BCP and CPPD-mediated cellular effects, we have investigated the mechanism by which BCP and CPPD transduce signals to the nucleus. Here we demonstrate that BCP and CPPD crystals activate a protein kinase signal transduction pathway involving p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (ERK 2 and ERK 1). BCP and CPPD also cause phosphorylation of a nuclear transcription factor, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), on serine 133, a residue essential for CREB's ability to transactivate. Treatment of cells with PC at concentrations of 10<sup>−3</sup> to 10<sup>−5</sup>m blocked both the activation of p42/p44 MAP kinases, and CREB serine 133 phosphorylation, in a dose-dependent fashion. At 10<sup>−3</sup>m, a PC analogue,<i>n</i>-sulfo-2-aminotricarballylate and citrate also modulate this signal transduction pathway. Inhibition by PC is specific for BCP- and CPPD-mediated signaling, since all three compounds had no effect on serum-induced p42/P44 or interleukin-1β induced p38 MAP kinase activities. Treatment of cells with an inhibitor of MEK1, an upstream activator of MAPKs, significantly inhibited crystal-induced cell proliferation, suggesting that the MAPK pathway is a significant mediator of crystal-induced signals."
https://openalex.org/W1980132250,"The m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m2 mAChR) belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors and is regulated by many processes that attenuate signaling following prolonged stimulation by agonist. We used a heterologous expression system to examine the ability of G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) and β-arrestin-1 to regulate the phosphorylation state and to promote desensitization and sequestration of the m2 mAChR. Treatment of JEG-3 cells transiently expressing the m2 mAChR with a muscarinic agonist induced an ∼4- or 8-fold increase in receptor phosphorylation in the absence or presence of cotransfected GRK2, respectively, compared with untreated cells transfected with receptor alone. Using the expression of a cAMP-regulated reporter gene to measure receptor function, we found that transiently transfected m2 mAChRs underwent functional desensitization following exposure to agonist. Transfected GRK2 enhanced agonist-induced functional desensitization in a manner that was synergistically enhanced by cotransfection of β-arrestin-1, which had no effect on m2 mAChR function when coexpressed in the absence of GRK2. Finally, GRK2 and β-arrestin-1 synergistically enhanced both the rate and extent of agonist-induced m2 mAChR sequestration. These results are the first to demonstrate that agonist-induced desensitization and sequestration of the m2 mAChR in the intact cell can be enhanced by the presence of GRK2 and β-arrestin-1 and show that these molecules have multiple actions on the m2 mAChR.

As with other members of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, the family of mAChRs is exquisitely regulated by processes that function to attenuate signaling in the presence of prolonged exposure to agonist. These processes, which differ in their time course and mechanism, have been termed desensitization, internalization (or sequestration), and down-regulation (9Nathanson N.M. Brown J.H. The Muscarinic Receptors. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1989: 419-454Crossref Google Scholar, 10Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar).Desensitization, the most rapid of these processes, is dependent upon receptor phosphorylation mediated either by second messenger kinases or by members of the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (11Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). GRK phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptors, which occurs only in the presence of agonist, is thought to promote the binding of one of the members of the arrestin family of molecules to the activated receptors (12Wilden U. Hall S. Kuhn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1174-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 13Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). To date, four members of the arrestin family have been cloned and characterized: arrestin, cone arrestin, β-arrestin-1, and β-arrestin-2 (or arrestin-3). Arrestin, β-arrestin-1, and β-arrestin-2 each appear to be alternatively spliced, generating at least two polypeptides for each isoform (11Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). Together, the actions of GRK-mediated phosphorylation coupled with arrestin binding lead to receptor-G protein uncoupling and desensitization. The family of GRKs, which has at least six members termed GRK1 through GRK6, includes rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) and β-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 and -2 (GRK2 and GRK3, respectively) (11Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-353PubMed Google Scholar). The activated m2 mAChR serves as an excellent substrate in vitro for both GRK2 (14Richardson R.M. Kim C. Benovic J.L.

The role of internalization in signal attenuation is not well understood, but it has been suggested that the primary function of internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor is to allow the dephosphorylation of receptors in preparation for their return to the plasma membrane (26Yu S.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that agonist-induced sequestration of the m2 mAChR, when transiently expressed in COS-7 and BHK-21 cells, could be enhanced by coexpression of GRK2 and attenuated by coexpression of a kinase-inactive GRK2 mutant. In contrast, Pals-Rylaarsdam et al. (20Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) reported that coexpression of wild-type and kinase-inactive GRK2 had no effect on agonist-induced m2 mAChR sequestration in a human embryonic kidney cell line.Currently, no information exists regarding the ability of specific GRKs to phosphorylate and promote desensitization of a muscarinic receptor in an intact cell, and as noted above, the role of GRK phosphorylation in sequestration of the m2 mAChR remains controversial. Moreover, blockade of desensitization and/or sequestration by kinase-inactive GRK2 indicates that a molecule that can interact with GRK is required, but does not prove that GRK2 itself is required. Whereas both β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 are known to bind the GRK-phosphorylated m2 mAChR in vitro (29Gurevich V.V. Richardson R.M. Kim C.M. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), there have been no reported studies describing the effects of a β-arrestin on either desensitization or sequestration of muscarinic receptors. We have used a heterologous expression system in which activation of the m2 receptor is coupled to the expression of a sensitive, cAMP-responsive reporter gene to examine the combined role of GRK2 and β-arrestin-1 in agonist-induced desensitization of the m2 mAChR in the intact cell. We report here that GRK2 and β-arrestin-1 can synergistically promote m2 mAChR desensitization and sequestration in JEG-3 cells, providing new insight into the regulation of m2 receptor function in the intact cell.DISCUSSIONNumerous studies have demonstrated phosphorylation of the m2 mAChR by a variety of GRKs using in vitro assay systems, but it has proven difficult to determine the functional consequences of this modification within an intact cell. Pals-Rylaarsdam et al.(20Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) demonstrated that coexpression of kinase-inactive GRK2 in a human embryonic kidney cell line not only attenuates phosphorylation of the m2 mAChR following exposure to agonist, but dramatically inhibits the associated desensitization. The primary drawback to this type of study is that while it demonstrates that a molecule that interacts with the kinase-inactive mutant is involved in receptor desensitization, it does not prove that the GRK itself is actually involved. In addition, this type of method cannot distinguish between different functional effects potentially caused by the actions of different GRK isoforms. For example, Tiberi et al. (44Tiberi M. Nash S.R. Bertrand L. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3771-3778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) found that whereas GRK2, GRK3, and GRK5 were able to phosphorylate the dopamine D1A receptor to similar extents, the desensitization associated with GRK5 phosphorylation was significantly more profound than that seen with either GRK2 or GRK3. We describe here a system that allows reconstitution of the desensitization machinery in intact cells to test the effects of different components on the functional responsiveness of the m2 mAChR using a cAMP-regulated reporter gene. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated the utility of such an approach, showing that the m2 and m4 mAChRs differentially couple to members of the Gi and Go class of G proteins in transiently transfected JEG-3 cells (36Migeon J.C. Thomas S.L. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16070-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), as well as the effects of different mutations on the activity of Giα-2 and Goα (45Migeon J.C. Thomas S.L. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29146-29152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Initially, using whole cell phosphorylation studies, we demonstrated that the m2 mAChR is phosphorylated following exposure to agonist in JEG-3 cells in the absence of added GRK2 expression vector (Fig. 1). Coexpression of GRK2 with the m2 mAChR led to a slight enhancement of basal phosphorylation, but the predominant effect was an increase in agonist-induced phosphorylation, which indicates that the m2 mAChR serves as a substrate for GRK2 in JEG-3 cells. This is in agreement with previous studies that demonstrated that the m2 receptor is an excellent substrate for both GRK2 and GRK3 in vitro (14Richardson R.M. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13650-13656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increased basal phosphorylation of other receptors has been seen in similar studies in which transient transfection has been used to overexpress GRK isoforms. For example, Ménard et al.(22Ménard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak S.L. Bertrand L. Premont A.-M.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4155-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of GRK4 and GRK6 enhanced primarily basal phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor and that GRK5 enhanced both basal and agonist-induced phosphorylation. Interestingly, coexpression of β-arrestin-1 led to a modest reduction of agonist-induced phosphorylation in cells cotransfected with GRK2 (Fig. 1). This might be explained by recent work demonstrating that β-arrestin-1 is involved in coupling activated receptors to the internalization machinery (23Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 24Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that one function of receptor internalization might be dephosphorylation of desensitized receptors in preparation for their return to the cell surface (26Yu S.S. Lefkowitz R.J. Hausdorff W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 337-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Pippig S. Andexinger S. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 666-676PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a phosphatase with activity toward GRK-phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors has been identified and found to be exclusively associated with the particulate fraction (46Pitcher J.A. Payne E.S. Csortos C. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).Using a heterologous expression system in which receptor activation is coupled to inhibition of CRE-luciferase expression, we demonstrated that transiently transfected m2 mAChRs become functionally desensitized when exposed to agonist (Fig. 2 A). Cotransfection of GRK2 led to a modest attenuation of receptor signaling in the absence of pretreatment and, more significantly, enhanced functional desensitization following exposure to agonist (Fig. 2 A). This agonist-induced desensitization in the presence of GRK2 was manifested by a shift in the dose-response curve for inhibition of forskolin-stimulated luciferase expression as well as a marked decrease in the maximal extent of inhibition. Coexpression of β-arrestin-1 led to an increase in both components of the desensitization seen in cells transfected with GRK2: signaling at high concentrations of agonist in the absence of pretreatment was decreased, and agonist-induced desensitization was enhanced (Fig. 2 B). The effects of β-arrestin-1 on m2 mAChR desensitization were dependent on the presence of cotransfected GRK2 cDNA; cotransfection of β-arrestin-1 in the absence of GRK2 had no effect on m2 mAChR signaling even though transiently expressed m2 mAChRs are phosphorylated when expressed alone in JEG-3 cells (Fig. 1). The lack of effect of β-arrestin-1 (in the absence of GRK2) on m2 mAChR signaling could be explained by a number of possibilities. First, phosphorylation of the m2 mAChR by the endogenous kinase(s) might be rate-limiting and the endogenous arrestin(s) present in excess, so additional β-arrestin-1 is unable to promote additional desensitization. Alternatively, the endogenous m2 mAChR kinase activity could be distinct from GRK2, so phosphorylation by this kinase does not promote the association of transiently expressed β-arrestin-1 in these cells in a way that promotes functional desensitization. Whereas different GRKs can promote qualitatively different forms of desensitization (44Tiberi M. Nash S.R. Bertrand L. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3771-3778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the question of whether different GRKs can promote the association of different β-arrestins or differentially regulate the functional effects of β-arrestin binding remains to be examined.Titration of GRK2 cDNA in the presence of β-arrestin-1 caused a dose-dependent decrease in the ability of the m2 mAChR to signal in the absence of pretreatment, primarily at higher concentrations of agonist (Fig. 4 A). Signaling at carbachol concentrations up to 1 μm was independent of the presence of exogenously expressed GRK2, suggesting that desensitization is negligible at these lower concentrations of carbachol. Alteration of the concentration of carbachol with which transiently transfected cells were pretreated allowed us to demonstrate that desensitization in JEG-3 cells coexpressing the m2 mAChR and either GRK2 or GRK2 in combination with β-arrestin-1 was negligible at concentrations of carbachol below 5 μm (Fig. 5). In contrast, pretreatment of these cells with 5 μm carbachol caused an ∼50% decrease in signaling. This is similar to the EC50 for carbachol to induce phosphorylation of exogenously expressed m2 mAChRs in Sf9 cell membranes (11.5 μm) (17Debburman S.K. Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 224-233PubMed Google Scholar) and of the endogenous muscarinic receptors found in chick heart (20 μm) (47Kwatra M.M. Leung E. Maan A.C. McMahon K.K. Ptasienski J. Green R.D. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16314-16321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are predominately the m2 subtype (48Tietje K.M. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17382-17387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 49Tietje K.M. Goldman P.S. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2828-2834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50McKinnon L.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20636-20642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of the m2 mAChR by GRK2 is responsible for the decreased ability of the receptor to signal at higher concentrations of carbachol.Despite having no direct effect on agonist-induced desensitization of the m2 mAChR, expression of β-arrestin-1 in JEG-3 cells in the absence of exogenous GRK2 expression enhanced both the rate and extent of agonist-induced m2 mAChR sequestration (Fig. 6 A). These effects were qualitatively similar to those seen with GRK2 expression, although the enhancement of sequestration by β-arrestin-1 at the earlier time points was slightly less than that seen with GRK2. The enhancement of sequestration seen with GRK2 and β-arrestin-1 coexpression was slightly greater than if the effects of each were simply added together, implying that the two molecules are acting synergistically. This synergism between GRK2 and β-arrestin-1 is similar to that seen with receptor desensitization (Fig. 2) and demonstrates for the first time that agonist-induced internalization of the m2 mAChR can be regulated by β-arrestin-1 and GRK2 together.Regulation of m2 mAChR sequestration by GRK2 has been reported previously (28Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that overexpression of GRK2 in COS-7 and BHK-21 cells enhanced sequestration of the m2 mAChR, whereas overexpression of a kinase-inactive GRK2 allele attenuated sequestration. In contrast, Pals-Rylaarsdam et al. (20Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) performed similar experiments in a human embryonic kidney cell line and found that coexpression of either GRK2 or kinase-inactive GRK2 had no effect on transiently expressed m2 mAChR internalization. The data presented in this report demonstrate that GRK2, in addition to β-arrestin-1, can indeed promote m2 mAChR internalization when expressed in JEG-3 cells. These data do not, however, prove that GRK2 and β-arrestin-1 are absolutely required for sequestration to occur. Indeed, at least two sequestration pathways appear to exist in HEK-293 cells, one that is dependent on β-arrestin and dynamin and one that is independent of these molecules (24Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and it is likely that multiple sequestration pathways exist in other cell types as well. In HEK-293 cells, sequestration of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor was found to be unaffected by a dominant-negative allele of dynamin unless recruited to this pathway by overexpression of β-arrestin-1. One explanation for the results of Pals-Rylaarsdam et al. (20Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) is that the dynamin-independent pathway may be the primary pathway by which m2 mAChRs undergo agonist-induced sequestration in human embryonic kidney cells and that this pathway may be insensitive to the effects of added GRK2 or kinase-inactive GRK2.In summary, we have demonstrated that the m2 mAChR can be regulated synergistically by coexpression of GRK2 and β-arrestin-1 in JEG-3 cells. In addition to being the predominant muscarinic receptor in the heart, the m2 mAChR is found in a variety of peripheral tissues and throughout the brain (51Caulfield M.P. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1993; 58: 319-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). In neuronal tissues, the m2 mAChR is found associated with cholinergic as well as non-cholinergic neurons, which suggests that it is found presynaptically and may be found postsynaptically as well (52Levey A.I. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Vilarò M.T. Wiederhold K.-H. Palacios J.M. Mengod G. Neuroscience. 1992; 47: 367-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This is similar to the distribution of both GRK2 and GRK3, which are found throughout the brain associated with both postsynaptic densities and axon terminals (54Arriza J.L. Dawson T.M. Simerly R.B. Martin L.J. Caron M.G. Snyder S.H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, β-arrestin-1 is found to be highly expressed in the brain (13Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), although its ultrastructural localization has not been examined. Together, these observations suggest that both GRK2 and β-arrestin-1 may colocalize with the m2 mAChR in the brain, making them ideally situated to regulate m2 receptor function. We have shown here that GRK2 coexpression in the intact cell enhanced phosphorylation of the m2 mAChR in an agonist-dependent manner, resulting in increased desensitization and sequestration. β-Arrestin-1 coexpression had relatively mild effects on m2 mAChR function by itself, but significantly enhanced the effects of GRK2, suggesting that the two molecules can act synergistically and showing that β-arrestin-1 can regulate the function of a muscarinic receptor in the intact cell. These results provide new and useful information that helps to explain the intricate mechanisms utilized by the cell to regulate m2 mAChR signaling.

Following its association with DNA at a primer-template junction, RFC catalyzes the transfer of PCNA (the “clamp”) onto DNA in the presence of ATP (“clamp loading”) (9Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes to Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 10Podust L.M. Podust V.N. Sogo J.M. Hübscher U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3072-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Pol δ is recruited to this protein-DNA complex and tethered to the DNA primer-template junction through its interaction with PCNA in a reaction that requires ATP hydrolysis. The resulting complex (pol δ holoenzyme) is then capable of highly processive DNA chain elongation (1Lee S.-H. Eki T. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7361-7365Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 2Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 3Lee S.-H. Kwong A.D.

Upon completion of DNA synthesis, the polymerase most likely rapidly dissociates from the tethered complex, leaving the stable PCNA sliding clamp associated with the newly synthesized DNA (12Hacker K.J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24221-24228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). RFC has been shown to efficiently remove PCNA clamps from DNA (9Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes to Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), an activity of particular importance in lagging strand replication which involves the synthesis of a large number of Okazaki DNA fragments. In human cells, the number of Okazaki fragments formed during one round of replication has been estimated to be 100 times greater than the molar amount of cellular PCNA (9Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes to Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that in addition to its role as a clamp loader, RFC also catalyzes the removal of PCNA from DNA to fulfill the requirements for a constant supply of PCNA for further DNA synthesis and other PCNA-dependent reactions. RFC contains multiple enzymatic activities including the ability to hydrolyze ATP to catalytically load PCNA onto DNA and subsequently recruit pol δ. Human RFC (hRFC) contains five subunits of 140, 40, 38, 37, and 36 kDa that share conserved regions, referred to as RFC boxes. Two of the conserved regions that contain GXXXXGK(S/T) (box III) and DE(V/A)D sequences (box V) are possible ATP binding sites (14O'Donnell M. Onrust R. Dean F.B. Chen M. Hurwitz J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 15Cullmann G. Fien K. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4661-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), but no single subunit of hRFC has been shown to hydrolyze ATP. The p40 subunit was shown to bind ATP but exhibited no detectable ATP hydrolyzing activity (16Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pan Z.-Q. Chen M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The yeast hRFC p36 homologue (Rfc3) exhibited DNA-dependent ATPase activity (18Li X. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but the purified hRFC p36 subunit isolated fromEscherichia coli or baculovirus overexpression systems failed to show such activity (data not shown). Thus, the identity of the hRFC subunit (or subunits) that catalyzes ATP hydrolysis is not known. We have previously demonstrated that the hRFC holoenzyme can be reconstituted from its five subunits expressed in either baculovirus-infected insect cells (19Cai J. Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Flores-Rozas H. Lee C.-G. Phillips B. Finkelstein J. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12896-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or in a reticulocyte in vitro transcription-translation system (20Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F.B. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that the hRFC p40, p37, and p36 subunits synthesized in the reticulocyte system formed a stable core complex to which the p140 and p38 subunits bind only when both are present (20Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F.B. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that the purified p40·p37·p36 complex formed in a baculovirus overexpression system contains DNA-dependent ATPase activity that is stimulated by PCNA. This three-subunit complex binds preferentially to primed DNA, interacts with PCNA, and inhibits RFC/PCNA-dependent DNA elongation catalyzed by pol δ. High levels of the p40·p37·p36 complex can unload PCNA from DNA but cannot load PCNA onto DNA. We also present evidence that the p40·p37·p36 complex, when incubated with the p140 and p38 subunits, is converted to the five-subunit RFC active in supporting DNA elongation. This finding indicates that the p40·p37·p36 complex is an intermediate in assembly of the RFC holoenzyme. Poly(dA)300and oligo(dT)30 were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. To prepare annealed poly(dA)300:oligo(dT)30, poly(dA)300 (33.3 fmol/μl) and oligo(dT)30were mixed at a molar ratio of 5:1, 1:1, or 1:5 in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 m NaCl. The mixture was heated at 75 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature and chilled on ice. pET16ap140 and 19bHisp38 DNAs were prepared as described previously (20Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F.B. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), φX174 single-stranded circular (ssc) viral DNA was obtained from New England Biolabs. Singly primed M13 ssc DNA and singly-nicked pBluescript (pBS) DNAs were prepared as described (21Kenny M.K. Lee S.-H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yao N. O'Donnell M. Gene ( Amst .). 1995; 166: 177-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Coupled in vitro transcription-translation reactions (12 or 24 μl) containing pET16ap140 (37.5 ng/μl) and/or pET19bHisp38 DNAs (21 ng/μl) were carried out in the presence or absence of the p40·p37·p36 complex (83 fmol/μl) at 30 °C for 90 min as described (20Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F.B. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To precipitatein vitro translated products formed after incubation, the reaction mixture (12 μl) was incubated with polyclonal antiserum (0.5 μl) against the RFC p37 subunit at 0 °C for 60 min. Immunocomplexes were then adsorbed to protein A-agarose beads (5 μl) at 0 °C for 30 min with frequent shaking. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.4% BSA) and twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins adsorbed to the beads were eluted with 20 μl of 2 × SDS gel loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 100 mm DTT), and aliquots (10 μl) were electrophoresed through a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE). After separation, the gel was fixed in 25% 2-propyl alcohol, 10% acetic acid, soaked in luminographic enhancer (Amplifer, Amersham Corp.), dried, and autoradiographed. Quantitation was performed using a phosphorimager (Fuji). RFC activity was assayed by its ability to support the elongation of singly primed M13 DNA in the presence of pol δ, PCNA, HSSB, and ATP (20Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F.B. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The standard assay (10 μl) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.01% BSA, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm ATP, 100 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 20 μm[α-32P]dCTP (1–2 × 104 cpm/pmol), 4.4 fmol of singly primed circular M13 DNA, 0.25 μg HSSB, 50 ng of PCNA (or as indicated), 20 fmol of pol δ (or as indicated), and RFC or subunits in amounts as indicated. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, stopped with 10 mm EDTA, and separated by electrophoresis through an alkaline agarose gel (1.5%) followed by autoradiography. For quantitation, an aliquot (1 μl) of the reaction mixture was withdrawn, and the amount of acid-insoluble material formed was determined. When in vitro translated products were used, hRFC subunits produced in 24-μl reactions were adsorbed to protein A-agarose beads (5 μl) containing polyclonal antibodies against the hRFC p37 subunit as described in the above immunoprecipitation procedure. The beads were added to DNA elongation reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 10 fmol of singly primed M13 DNA and other components as described for the standard assay or as indicated. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with frequent shaking, replication products were analyzed as described above. ATPase activity was measured in reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml BSA, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1.5 × 104 cpm/pmol), 12.5 μm DNA (as nucleotides), and the p40·p37·p36 complex as indicated. After 60 min at 37 °C, aliquots (1 μl) were spotted on polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer plates which were developed in 1.0 m formic acid, 0.5m LiCl for 20 min at room temperature. The plates were dried and exposed for autoradiography. One unit of ATPase activity was defined as the formation of 1 nmol of Pi under the reaction conditions used as quantitated by phosphorimager (Fuji) analysis. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were carried out in reaction mixtures (25 μl) containing binding buffer (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 20 mm NaCl), the p40·p37·p36 complex (in amounts as indicated), and 40 fmol of 5′ 32P-labeled poly(dA)300 (700–1500 cpm/fmol), or 5′32P-labeled oligo(dT)30 (2000–4000 cpm/fmol), or 5′ 32P-labeled poly(dA)300 hybridized to unlabeled oligo(dT)30 at various molar ratios as indicated. After incubation for 30 min at 0 °C, the mixtures were filtered through alkaline-washed nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, HA 0.45 μm) which were then washed three times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer. The radioactivity adsorbed to the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Protein-protein interactions were examined using surface plasmon resonance. The immobilization of PCNA on sensor chips was carried out using the carbodiimide covalent linkage protocol specified in the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia Biosensor). The interaction between immobilized PCNA and bRFC or the p40·p37·p36 complex in solution was followed by monitoring changes in the surface concentration of proteins on sensor chips using the BIAcore 2000 at room temperature. The loading of32P-labeled PCNA onto DNA was carried out in reaction mixtures (50 μl), containing 0.5 pmol of singly nicked pBluescript DNA, 2.6 pmol of 32P-labeled PCNA trimers (∼1500 cpm/fmol) in 50 μl of incubation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 4% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, and 40 μg/ml BSA) and 200 fmol of bRFC. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, stopped on ice, and then applied at 4 °C to a 5-ml gel filtration column (Bio-Gel A15m, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with incubation buffer. Fractions of 170 μl were collected, and 32P was quantitated by Cerenkov counting. The release of 32P-PCNA complexed to DNA (the unloading reaction) was carried out in reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 83 fmol of PCNA (as trimer) loaded onto singly nicked DNA (isolated by gel filtration), incubation buffer (as described above), and bRFC or the p40·p37·p36 complex (in amounts as indicated). Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was halted by placing tubes on ice. Reactions were then filtered at 4 °C through a 5-ml gel filtration column (Bio-Gel, A15m, Bio-Rad) to resolve the 32P-PCNA (eluting in the included volume) from 32P-PCNA bound to DNA (eluting in the excluded volume). Fractions of 170 μl were collected and the32P quantitated by Cerenkov counting. Recombinant baculoviruses that produced the p40, p37, and p36 subunits of hRFC were as described previously (19Cai J. Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Flores-Rozas H. Lee C.-G. Phillips B. Finkelstein J. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12896-12901Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were grown at 27 °C to a cell density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Sf9 cells (2 × 108, 200 ml) were infected simultaneously with recombinant viruses that produced the p40, p37, and p36 subunits of hRFC at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for each virus and were maintained in a 2-liter glass flask at 27 °C for 48 h with constant shaking (100 rpm). The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 300 × g for 15 min. The cell pellet was washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 2 volumes of hypotonic buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 μg/ml antipain) per volume of packed cells, and lysed with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 2,400 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (cytosolic extract, 95 mg, 9 ml) was saved, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 2 volumes of extraction buffer (hypotonic buffer without 10 mm KCl) per volume of packed cells and the mixture adjusted to a final concentration of 0.42m NaCl. After centrifugation at 43,500 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (nuclear extract, 35 mg, 5 ml) was combined with the cytosolic extract, and the mixture was centrifuged at 44,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for the purification of the p40·p37·p36 complex as described below. SDS-PAGE (9%) followed by Coomassie staining and Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for the p40, p37, and p36 subunits of RFC were employed to monitor all purification steps which were carried out at 4 °C. Extracts (120 mg of protein, 13 ml), prepared as described above, were adjusted to 0.1 m NaCl and chromatographed on a SP-Sepharose column (1.5 × 2.9 cm) equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml antipain, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10% glycerol) plus 0.1 m NaCl. After washing the column with 3-bed volumes of equilibration buffer, bound proteins were eluted using a 50-ml gradient from 0.1 to 0.4m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing the p40, p37, and p36 subunits eluted at 0.25 m NaCl and were pooled (14 mg protein, 15 ml). After adjusting the NaCl concentration to 0.05m, the pooled fractions were loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (1.0 × 1.5 cm) that was developed with a gradient (12 ml) of 0.05 to 0.4 m NaCl in buffer A. The p40·p37·p36 complex, which eluted at 0.3 m NaCl, was identified by SDS-PAGE analysis and the DNA-dependent ATPase activity assay. Prior to this step, the DNA-independent ATPase activity was too high for reliable measurement of DNA-dependent ATPase activity. The pooled fractions containing the p40·p37·p36 complex (3.7 mg of protein, 4.5 ml) contained 1672 units of DNA-dependent ATPase activity with a specific activity of 452 units/mg. After adjustment to 0.1 m NaCl, these fractions were loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column (1.0 × 1.3 cm) equilibrated with 0.1 m NaCl in buffer A. A gradient solution (10 ml) of 0.1 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A was used to elute bound proteins. Fractions containing the three RFC subunits eluted at 0.25 m NaCl and were pooled (2.45 mg, 3.5 ml, 1575 units, 643 units/mg), adjusted to 0.05 m NaCl, and chromatographed through an ATP-agarose (Sigma, N-6 attachment, 11 atom spacer) column (1.0 × 1.8 cm) that was developed with a 14-ml 0.05 to 0.5 m NaCl gradient in buffer A. The p40·p37·p36 complex eluted as a broad peak between 0.1 and 0.5m NaCl, whereas most of the contaminating proteins eluted between 0.05 and 0.2 m NaCl. Thus, fractions eluting between 0.2 and 0.5 m NaCl were pooled (0.59 mg, 6 ml, 520 units, 880 units/mg) and concentrated using the Ultrafree-15 centrifuge filter membrane (10K, Millipore). An aliquot (200 μg, 150 μl, 131 units, 657 units/mg) of the concentrated material was then sedimented through a 15–35% glycerol gradient (5 ml) in buffer A plus 250 mm NaCl at 250,000 × g for 24 h at 4 °C. Pooled glycerol gradient fractions (100 μg, 0.66 ml, 114 units, 1140 units/mg) were stored at −80 °C and showed no loss of activity over a 2-month period with repeated cycles of freezing and thawing. The yield of the p40·p37·p36 complex obtained from 200 ml of infected Sf9 cells was ∼0.3 mg, representing a total recovery of 10% of the protein (as estimated by Western blot analysis). Densitometry analysis of Coomassie-stained gels was performed using the Molecular Imager and Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad). The p40·p37·p36 complex was assembled in vivo by coexpressing the p40, p37, and p36 subunits in baculovirus-infected insect cells. After harvesting the cells, cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” The combined cytosolic and nuclear extracts before and after viral infection were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The overproduced p40, p37, and p36 subunits were not visible on SDS-PAGE after Coomassie staining (lane 2). All three subunits were detected by Western blot analyses using antibodies specific for each subunit, and the amount of p36, p37, and p40 protein formed was estimated to be 0.5–1% total protein (data not shown). The p40·p37·p36 complex was purified by a number of chromatographic steps and glycerol gradient centrifugation as described under “Materials and Methods.” Following glycerol gradient centrifugation, three protein bands were observed that migrated through SDS-polyacrylamide gels at positions corresponding to those of the hRFC p40, p37, and p36 subunits (lane 3). The identity of each subunit was confirmed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies specific for each subunit (lanes 4–6). Densitometry analysis of the Coomassie-stained gels indicated that the p40, p37, and p36 subunits were present at a molar ratio of 1.0:1.1:1.0. The RFC p40, p37, and p36 subunits cosedimented through the glycerol gradient (Fig. 2 A), peaking in fraction 13, between aldolase (158 kDa, fractions 9 and 10) and BSA (66 kDa, fraction 14) with a sedimentation coefficient of 4.8, indicating that these subunits exist as a stable complex. When individual subunits were subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation, the p40 and p37 subunits peaked at fraction 16, whereas the p36 subunit was detected in lower fractions of the gradient most likely due to protein aggregation (data not shown). The cosedimentation of the three subunits is consistent with our previous finding that in vitro transcribed-translated hRFC p40, p37, and p36 subunits form a stable complex consisting of equimolar amounts of each subunit (20Uhlmann F.

PCNA was added in amounts as indicated to reaction mixtures containing 50 ng of the p40·p37·p36 complex in the presence of 12.5 μm of poly(dA)300 or poly(dA)300:oligo(dT)30.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have also constructed a baculovirus vector that produces the RFC p36 subunit with an additional 6-histidine residue at the N terminus. The p40·p37·p36 complex was assembled by coexpressing the His-tagged p36 subunit with the p40 and p37 subunits in baculovirus-infected insect cells, and the complex was purified using a Ni2+affinity column followed by glycerol gradient centrifugation. The p40·p37·p36 complex that eluted from the Ni2+column with imidazole contained excess levels of the uncomplexed His-tagged p36 subunit in addition to the p40·p37·p36 complex. The excess p36 subunit was not totally removed by the glycerol gradient centrifugation. The purified p40·p37·p36 complex containing either the untagged or His-tagged p36 subunit had essentially identical properties (data not shown). ATP hydrolysis is required in order for RFC to load PCNA onto primed DNA templates and recruit pol δ. However, none of the hRFC subunits isolated from E. coli or baculovirus overexpression systems has been shown to exhibit ATPase activity (17; data not shown) suggesting that multiple subunits may be required for this activity. Therefore, we examined the purified p40·p37·p36 complex for its ability to hydrolyze ATP, and as shown in Fig.1 C this DNA-dependent activity peaked in fraction 13 of the glycerol gradient, coincidental with the sedimentation of the p40·p37·p36 protein complex. The effects of various DNA effectors on the ATPase activity of the complex were examined (Fig. 2 A). The p40·p37·p36 complex possessed weak ATPase activity that was stimulated maximally (34-fold) by φX174 ssc DNA, 10-fold by poly(dA)300:oligo(dT)30, 6-fold by poly(dA)300, and 4-fold by oligo(dT)30. These properties are similar to those observed for the five-subunit RFC purified from HeLa cells (3Lee S.-H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.-Q. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 594-602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or from baculovirus-infected insect cells (19Cai J. Uhlmann F. Gibbs E. Flores-Rozas H. Lee C.-G. Phillips B. Finkelstein J.

https://openalex.org/W2064510642,"The largest subunit of RNA polymerase II contains a C-terminal repeated domain (CTD) that is the site of phosphorylation by serine (threonine) and tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation of the CTD is correlated with transcription elongation. A number of different kinases have previously been shown to phosphorylate the CTD; among them is a nuclear tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-ablproto-oncogene. The processive and high stoichiometric phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by c-Abl requires the tyrosine kinase, the SH2 domain, and a CTD-interacting domain (CTD-ID) in the Abl protein. The physiological tyrosine phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by c-Abl in DNA damage response has previously been demonstrated. Basal tyrosine phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, however, is observed in cells derived from abl-deficient mice, indicating the existence of other CTD tyrosine kinases. In this report, we show that the tyrosine kinase encoded by an Abl-relatedgene (Arg) also phosphorylates the CTD in vitroand in transfected cells. The SH2 and kinase domain of Arg are 95% identical to that of c-Abl. However, these two proteins share only 29% identity in the large C-terminal region. Interestingly, a CTD-ID is also found in the C-terminal region of Arg. Mapping studies and sequence analysis have led to the identification of the CTD-ID that is highly conserved among the divergent C-terminal regions of Abl and Arg. These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II CTD could be catalyzed by either c-Abl or Arg kinase.

The product of proto-oncogene c-abl and its related gene, arg, encode nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that are ubiquitously expressed in mouse and human cells (1Renshaw M.W. Capozza M.A. Wang J.Y.J.

The two proteins are 95% identical in the N-terminal SH3, SH2, and tyrosine kinase domains. The C-terminal regions that constitute more than one-half of both proteins exhibit an overall identity of only 29% (2Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

This large C-terminal region that distinguishes c-Abl from the other family of nonreceptor kinases is required for the proper biological function of c-Abl. Truncation of the C terminus causes neonatal lethality in mice, a phenotype similar to the one observed with mice carrying homozygous null mutation for c-abl (4Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E.

The largest subunit of RNA polymerase contains a unique C-terminal domain that is composed of a seven-amino acid repeat with the consensus sequence YSPTSPS (16Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 17Corden J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 387-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The heptad sequence is repeated 52 times in mammals, 44 times in Drosophila melanogaster, and 26 times in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (17Corden J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 387-838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The CTD 1The abbreviations used are: CTD, C-terminal repeated domain; CTD-ID, CTD-interacting domain; RNAP, RNA polymerase; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; Arg, Abl-related gene. of RNAP is essential for cell growth because truncation of more than half of the repeats in yeast causes cold sensitivity and inability to induce specific gene expression such as INO 1 and GAL 10 (18Scafe C. Chiao D. Lopes J. Hisch J.P. Henry J.P. Henry S. Young R. Nature. 1990; 347: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In mouse, a similar truncation in an α-amanitin-resistant RNA polymerase caused inability of the polymerase to confer α-amanitin resistance (19Bartolomei M. Halden N.F. Cullem C.R. Corden J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because the CTD is rich in serine, threonine, and tyrosine, it serves as a substrate for both serine (threonine) and tyrosine kinases. Several CTD kinases have been identified in yeast and mammals. In yeast, the cyclin-dependent kinase Kin 28, a component of the holo-TFIIH, has been shown to phosphorylate the CTD (20Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 21Cismowski M.J. Laff G.M. Solomon M.J. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologue of TFIIH-associated CTD kinase has been shown to be the cdk7/cyclin H kinase pair (22Roy R. Adamczewski J.P. Seroz T. Vermeulen W. Tassan J.-P. Schaeffer L. Nigg E.A. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1093-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Another yeast CTD kinase, SRB10/11 kinase-cyclin pair, has been identified as the mammalian cdk8/cyclin C (23Liao S.M. Zhang J. Jeffery D.A. Koleske A.J. Thompson C.M. Chiao D.M. Viljoen M. VanVuuren H.J. Young R. Nature. 1995; 9: 193-196Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Thus far, the only kinase known to phosphorylate RNAP-CTD on tyrosines is c-Abl (13Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Baskaran R. Dahmus M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). c-Abl can phosphorylate the CTD to high stoichiometry with the incorporation of >30 mol of phosphate/mol of CTD. Such a high stoichiometric phosphorylation by Abl requires binding of the SH2 domain of Abl to partially tyrosine-phosphorylated CTD (13Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CTD phosphorylation by Abl both in vivo andin vitro requires a CTD-interacting domain (CTD-ID) present at the C terminus of Abl (15Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strongest evidence that c-Abl phosphorylates RNA polymerase IIin vivo came from the study of cellular response to DNA damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). We have found that MMS activates c-Abl tyrosine kinase in S phase cells (24Liu Z. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We have also shown that MMS can cause an increase in the phosphotyrosine content of RNA polymerase II, but only when c-Abl is present (24Liu Z. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In Abl-null cells or in cells reconstituted with a kinase-defective c-Abl, MMS did not induce a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (24Liu Z. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, Abl-null cells or cells expressing only the kinase-defective Abl contain basal levels of phosphotyrosine in the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (14Baskaran R. Dahmus M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11167-11171Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 24Liu Z. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This suggested that basal tyrosine phosphorylation could be catalyzed by another tyrosine kinase. To identify the alternative CTD-tyrosine kinase, we tested the Arg gene product and showed that this tyrosine kinase can indeed phosphorylate the CTD. COS cells were cultured at 37 C° in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% supplemented calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer protocol or using the DEAE-dextran method. Two days after transfection, the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h with 1 μm ouabain before harvesting (15Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type and mutant Arg cDNA (human type IB) were cloned in pBS (Bluescript, Stratagene) vector. For transient cotransfection studies, wild type and mutants of Arg were expressed from a cytomegalovirus promoter-based vector CB6+ (25Wang B. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 193-197PubMed Google Scholar). The ΔSma construct removed amino acids 1128–1182, whereas ΔAcc deleted 1043–1182, ΔCla-Pflm1 removed 547–913, ΔPflm1 deleted 913–1182, and ΔPflm1-Acc removed amino acids 913–1043. The cDNA of murine CTD was subcloned into pEBG to obtain pEBG-CTD, which expresses the GST-CTD in eukaryotic cell lines (15Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal (8WG16) and polyclonal antibodies against RNAP and c-Abl have been described previously (15Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kim W.-Y. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14219-14225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-Arg antibody has been described (25Wang B. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 193-197PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mysliwiec T. Perego R. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 631-640PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Tyr(P) was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Wild type and mutant Abl or Arg proteins were obtained by in vitrotranslation using TNT reticulocyte lysate (Promega) with either T3 or T7 RNA polymerase. The translation mixture was diluted to give a final concentration of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmEDTA, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg each of phenanthroline, aprotinin, leupeptide, and pepstatin. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Arg or anti-Abl antibody was carried out as described previously (15Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, after which Protein A/G-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for an additional 1 h. The immunoprecipitants were washed twice with Buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl, twice with Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl, and twice with Buffer A alone. The immune complexes containing similar amounts of wild type and mutant Arg or Abl proteins were rinsed and suspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.2 μg of GST-CTD or 0.05 μg of purified HeLa RNAP IIA or IIB. Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μm ATP plus 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol; ICN). Reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 min (RNAP II) and 30 min (GST-CTD substrates) before the addition of SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-P, and exposed for autoradiography. Quantitation was done using PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The identification of tyrosine-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II in Abl-null cells indicated the presence of other tyrosine kinases capable of phosphorylating RNAP-CTD (14Baskaran R. Dahmus M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11167-11171Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In human and in mouse, a c-Abl-related gene product, Arg, has been cloned and sequenced (Fig.1). In humans, the Arg gene product was identified as a 140-kDa protein that is widely expressed in various tissues (28Perego R. Ron D. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1899-1902PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if Arg kinase could phosphorylate the CTD of RNAP in vitro, human type IB Arg was translated in vitro, immunoprecipitated, and incubated with purified RNAP IIA or IIB in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2 A). In thelane containing RNAP IIA (lane 1), a radiolabeled band corresponding in molecular mass to subunit IIa could be detected. This suggests that Arg phosphorylated RNAP II. Subunit IIa was not labeled when RNAP II was incubated with control immunoprecipitates (lane 3). To show that, indeed, it is the CTD of RNAP that is the target of Arg tyrosine kinase, the C-terminal truncated subunit IIb form was also incubated with the Arg kinase. Under similar reaction conditions, only IIa, but not the C-terminal truncated IIb, could be phosphorylated by the Arg kinase (Fig. 2 A, comparelane 2 with lane 1). The inability to phosphorylate subunit IIb, which lacks the CTD but contains 32 tyrosines, strongly suggests that Arg specifically phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the CTD. To test this directly, a GST-CTD fusion protein expressed and purified from bacteria was also tested. The GST-CTD was found to be an effective substrate for the Arg tyrosine kinase since, under the condition assayed, a smeary band was observed upon incubation of GST-CTD with Arg (Fig. 2 B). The observation that the GST alone was not phosphorylated indicates that phosphorylation occurs within the CTD portion of the fusion protein. Taken together, these results show that the CTD of RNA polymerase II is a substrate for the Arg tyrosine kinase.Figure 2A, Arg phosphorylates the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II. Human type IB Arg was in vitrotranslated, immunoprecipitated, and incubated with purified RNAP IIA or IIB. The reaction products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon, and probed with anti-Arg antibody. Left panel, autoradiogram.

Each kinase reaction contained 100 ng of GST-CTD, 10 μm ATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Incubation was for 30 min at room temperature. Total reaction mixtures were resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Immobilon, and probed with anti-Arg antibody. Left panel, autoradiography. Right panel, immunoblot probed with anti-Arg antibody. NRS, nonreactive serum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In an effort to compare the ability of Abl and Arg to phosphorylate the CTD, both the kinases were immunoprecipitated fromin vitro translations and incubated with increasing concentrations of GST-CTD in the presence of ATP (Fig.3 A). To compare the CTD-specific kinase activity of these two kinases, a nonspecific substrate, namely acid-denatured enolase, was also used. Under the conditions assayed, Arg phosphorylated the enolase substrate 2.2-fold better than Abl kinase (lanes 11 and 12). Fig. 3 Bshows the incorporation of 32P into GST-CTD as a function of increasing CTD concentrations. After normalizing for the equal kinase activity input in the kinase assays, it can be seen that both of these kinases phosphorylated the CTD equally well at the concentrations of the substrate tested (Fig. 3 B). These results show that both Arg and c-Abl tyrosine kinase have the ability to phosphorylate the RNAP II with equal efficiency in vitro. Previously, we have found that a CTD-ID located between the Sal andBgl sites in the C terminus of c-Abl is required for RNAP II phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo (15Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of the CTD-ID leads to an increase in theK m of c-Abl for the CTD (15Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The efficient phosphorylation of the CTD by Arg kinase suggested that domains similar to those present in c-Abl kinase, which are required for CTD phosphorylation, must be present in the Arg kinase. In Arg, the SH2 and kinase domain share >95% homology with Abl (Fig. 1). However, the C-terminal domain of the Arg kinase differs considerably and exhibits only 29% homology to the c-Abl C terminus. To determine regions in the C terminus of Arg that are required for CTD phosphorylation, a series of truncation and internal deletion mutants in the C terminus of Arg kinase were constructed and tested for phosphorylation of the GST-CTD fusion protein (Fig. 4). The CTD-specific kinase activity for each of these mutants was determined by normalizing the kinase activity for each of these mutants with a nonspecific substrate, enolase. Although specific mutations in the C terminus affected CTD phosphorylation, they did not affect enolase phosphorylation. A compilation of the results obtained with various mutants of Arg after normalizing for equal protein input is given in Fig. 4. As expected, C-terminal deletion mutants, ΔPflm1 (not shown) and ΔAcc (Fig.5, lanes 5–7) in which 269 and 139 amino acids were deleted could not phosphorylate the CTD efficiently. However, deletion of 54 amino acids from the C terminus did not affect CTD phosphorylation (Fig. 5, lanes 9–11). This indicated that the region between Acc and Sma is necessary for efficient CTD phosphorylation. An internal deletion mutant ΔPflm1-Acc in which amino acids 547–913 were removed exhibited CTD kinase activity similar to that of full-length Arg (not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that a specific region in the C terminus of Arg kinase (between Acc and Sma, amino acids 1043–1128) is required for efficient phosphorylation of the CTD.Figure 5Mapping of the CTD interaction domain in Arg. CTD phosphorylation as a function of CTD concentration. Full-length (lanes 1–3) and two truncation mutations, ΔAcc (lanes 5–7) and ΔSma-Arg (lanes 9–11), were assayed for CTD kinase activity as a function of CTD concentration. The amounts of GST-CTD added were 0.02 (lanes 1, 5, and 9), 0.1 (lanes 2, 6, and10), and 0.2 μg (lanes 3, 7, and11). Lanes 4, 8, and 12 contained 1 μg of acid-denatured enolase. The phosphorylated samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Immobilon, and exposed for autoradiography. Wt, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because Arg phosphorylates the CTD efficiently in vitro, we tested whether Arg can phosphorylate RNAP-CTD in vivo. For this purpose, Arg was cotransfected with GST-CTD construct in COS cells, and the phosphotyrosine content of the CTD was analyzed by reacting to anti-Tyr(P) antibodies. Anti-GST immunoprecipitates prepared from cells transfected with GST-CTD in the presence and absence of Arg kinase were probed with anti-CTD and anti-Tyr(P) antibody. Cells transfected with GST-CTD alone contained a protein band of the expected molecular weight for GST-CTD (Fig.6 A, lane 1). However, in the presence of wild type Arg, a smeary shifted band was observed (lane 2). Anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting of a similar blot indicated that the mobility-shifted band contained phosphotyrosine (panel C, compare lane 1 with lane 2). The anti-Tyr(P) signal was completely eliminated when phosphotyrosine was included in the immunoblotting reaction, indicating specificity of the signals generated by the Tyr(P) antibodies (panel B). Thus, Arg kinase phosphorylates the CTD in vivo. To determine if the phosphorylation of the RNAP II CTD by Arg kinase requires the region between Acc and Sma, the assay was applied to relevant Arg mutant proteins overproduced in COS cells. Mutants of Arg such as ΔSma and ΔPflm1-Acc, which phosphorylated the CTD efficiently in vitro, scored positive in this assay (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4 and5). However, ΔPflm1 and ΔAcc could not phosphorylate the CTD (lanes 3 and 6) despite equal levels of expression in these transfected cells (Fig. 6 D). The low molecular weight bands are most likely due to degradation. Since the autophosphorylation ability of these mutants was not affected (not shown), it can be inferred that it is the lack of CTD-ID that prevented these mutants from phosphorylating the CTD in vivo. A comparison of the amino acid sequences between Acc andSma in Arg kinase to that of previously mapped CTD-ID (Sal-Bgl) in Abl kinase indicated the presence of a highly conserved amino acid stretch (see Fig. 8 A). Previously, we mapped the amino acids 935–1065 (Sal-Bgl) of Abl kinase C terminus to be the CTD-ID (Fig. 1). The results obtained from Arg CTD-ID suggested that the CTD-ID in Abl is between amino acids 1002 and 1065 (Sca-Bgl). To determine if this was the case, an internal deletion mutant of Abl, Sca-Bgl, was constructed and tested for its ability to phosphorylate the CTD in vivo. Anti-GST immunoprecipitates from wild type Abl as well as ΔBgl, but not ΔSal-Bgl- and ΔSca-Bgl-transfected cells, contained the mobility-shifted CTD band (Fig.7 A, compare lanes 2 and5 with 3 and 4). The presence of phosphotyrosine in mobility-shifted GST-CTD was confirmed by anti-Tyr(P) immunoblotting (panel C). The expression levels of various Abl mutants shown in Fig. 7 D indicate the presence of approximately similar levels of expression of these mutants. Together, these results allow us to further narrow down the CTD-ID of Abl to the amino acids 1002–1065 (Sca-Bgl) region of the kinase.Figure 7The conserved CTD-ID is required for Abl to phosphorylate the CTD. Wild type (Wt) and two internal deletion mutants of Abl (ΔSal-Bgl and ΔSca-Bgl) were cotransfected with GST-CTD into COS cells. The GST-CTD was immunoprecipitated using anti-GST antibody, and the immune complex was analyzed for protein content as well as phosphotyrosine content by probing with anti-CTD(8WG16) (A) or with anti-Tyr(P) (anti-PTyr) (B) antibody containing 1 mm phosphotyrosine. C, a similar blot was probed with anti-Tyr(P) (anti-PTyr) antibody alone. D, the expression of the full-length and mutants of Abl was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Abl antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If the highly conserved region in Arg and Abl C termini constitutes the CTD-ID, then addition of exogenous CTD-ID should compete for the CTD and, thus, inhibit Abl as well as Arg phosphorylation of the CTD. A synthetic peptide corresponding to an 18-amino acid stretch in the CTD-ID (Fig. 8 A) was synthesized and added to in vitro Abl as well as Arg kinase assays. A nonspecific peptide that contained an identical amino acid composition, but scrambled sequence, was also used as a control. The nonspecific peptide had little effect on the ability of Abl or Arg to phosphorylate CTD (Fig. 8 B, lanes 1–3 and7–9). A small inhibition observed in the CTD kinase activity of Abl at 1:50 molar ratio could be a nonspecific effect. Nevertheless, both Abl and Arg CTD kinase activity was affected at each of the specific peptide concentrations tested (Fig. 8, comparelanes 4–6 with 10–12). These results provide additional support that the conserved C-terminal region between Arg and Abl kinase contains the CTD-interacting domain. The CTD of RNA polymerase II is found to be a substrate for the Abl-related gene (arg) product, Arg. Full-length RNA polymerase II large subunit purified from HeLa cells and a bacterially expressed GST-CTD could be efficiently phosphorylated by the Arg kinase. On comparison, the CTD kinase activity of Arg was equivalent to that of c-Abl kinase with a similar value of K m in the 0.4–1.0 μm range. In addition, CTD phosphorylation by Arg is shown to require a CTD-interacting domain that has been previously identified in the C terminus of c-Abl kinase. Mapping studies and sequence comparison led to the assignment of the CTD-ID to a highly conserved sequence in the otherwise divergent C-terminal region of Abl and Arg. The identification of the CTD-ID was further confirmed by the inhibition of CTD kinase with a synthetic peptide containing the identified CTD-ID sequence. The high degree of conservation of amino acid sequence in the SH2, kinase, and the CTD-ID region between Arg and Abl kinases indicates that these two kinases share substrate specificity for RNAP II phosphorylation. The c-Abl kinase has been shown to be present both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (9McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Van Etten R.A. Jackson P.K. Baltimore D. Sanders M.C. Matsudaira P.T. Janmey P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 325-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Wang and Kruh (25Wang B. Kruh G.D. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 193-197PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that when overexpressed in COS cells, Arg is mostly localized in cytoplasm, with minor fractions of the protein present in the nucleus. Due to the lack of specific antibodies that can recognize endogenous Arg, it has not been possible to determine the subcellular localization of Arg in Abl-null cells. In any case, it is possible that Arg may substitute for Abl kinase in these cells in order to catalyze the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. However, we cannot rule out that the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II in Abl-null cells is catalyzed by other tyrosine kinases that are unrelated to either Abl or Arg. Recently, we have shown that several DNA damaging agents such as cisplatin, IR (γ-irradiation), MMS, and mitomycin C can activate Abl kinase activity, and this activation is correlated with an increase in the phosphotyrosine content of RNAP II (24Liu Z. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). When Abl-null cells were exposed to DNA-damaging agents, no increase in the phosphotyrosine content of RNA polymerase was observed (24Liu Z. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We have also shown that that IR activation of Abl is dependent on the function of theataxia telangiectasia mutated gene product. In AT patient cells, IR does not activate Abl and does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of RNAP II (29Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). If Arg is involved in maintaining the basal tyrosine phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, this result would suggest that Arg may not be activated by DNA damage-induced signaling event. Given the fact that Arg and Abl are highly divergent in the C-terminal region except for the CTD-interacting domain, it is possible that these two kinases may transduce different signals to mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the CTD has been correlated with the stimulation of promoter activity (15Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The c-Abl tyrosine kinase is regulated by at least three signals. Integrin receptor-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix is required to activate c-Abl (30Lewis J. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, c-Abl activity is further regulated by retinoblastoma in the cell cycle (31Welch P.J Wang J.Y.J.

Because c-Abl and Arg can phosphorylate RNAP-CTD, these tyrosine kinases can transduce signals directly to RNA polymerase II to regulate transcription. We thank M. E.

Insulin stimulated both antiphosphotyrosine-precipitable PI 3-kinase activity and 3-O-methylglucose transport in isolated skeletal muscle (both ≈2–3-fold). Insulin stimulation of 3-O-methylglucose transport was inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (IC50 = 2.5 μm). The PI 3-kinase adapter subunits were purified from muscle lysates using phosphopeptide beads based on the Tyr-751 region of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Immunoblotting of the material adsorbed onto the phosphopeptide beads revealed the presence of p85α, p85β, p55PIK/p55γ, and p50 adapter subunit isoforms. In addition, p85α-NSH2 antibodies recognized four adapter subunit variants of 54, 53, 48, and 46 kDa, the latter corresponding to the p50 splice variant. Serial immunoprecipitations demonstrated that these four proteins were associated with a large proportion of the total PI 3-kinase activity immunoprecipitated by p85α-NSH2 domain antibodies. Antibodies to p85β, p55PIK/p55γ, and the p50 adapter subunit also immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase activity from human muscle lysates.

However, many growth factors that stimulate PI 3-kinase do not stimulate glucose metabolism, suggesting that different signaling inputs have specific mechanisms for utilizing the PI 3-kinase signaling system to generate downstream responses (reviewed in Ref.15Shepherd P.R.

Two widely expressed ≈85-kDa forms of the adapter subunit were originally characterized: p85α and p85β.

PI 3-kinase purified from liver has also been reported to associate with a 46-kDa protein that cross-reacts with p85 antibodies (25Kurosu H. Hazeki O. Kukimoto I. Honzawa S. Shibasaki M. Nakada M. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All of these truncated adapter subunit variants contain two SH2 domains and the P2 proline-rich domains, but lack the SH3 domain, the Bcr homology domain, and the P1 proline-rich domain of full-length p85. The main mechanism by which insulin regulates PI 3-kinase activity is by tyrosine phosphorylation of specific YMXM motifs on the intracellular signaling intermediates IRS-1 and IRS-2, which enables the recruitment of PI 3-kinase via the SH2 domain on the PI 3-kinase adapter subunit (26White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This increases cellular PI 3-kinase activity by a combination of increasing the catalytic activity of p110 (27Backer J.M. Myers M.G. Shoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B.

It is not clear whether the different isoforms of the adapter subunit play independent or overlapping roles in intracellular signaling pathways. However, the possibility exists that specificity could be introduced into the PI 3-kinase system by differential recruitment of the individual adapter subunits in response to activation of different receptor tyrosine kinases. Such interactions would provide a mechanism by which multiple signaling inputs could use PI 3-kinase in different ways to obtain specific signaling outcomes. In this study, we have investigated the PI 3-kinase signaling system in human skeletal muscle using a unique muscle strip preparation (29Zierath J.R. Galuska D. Nolte L.A. Thorne A. Smedgaard-Kristensen J. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The data obtained provide strong evidence that PI 3-kinase plays a crucial role in insulin signaling to glucose transport in human skeletal muscle. Furthermore, we have focused on the role of individual variants of the PI 3-kinase adapter subunit in insulin signaling. We have identified seven variants of the PI 3-kinase adapter subunit present in human skeletal muscle, and we demonstrate that these are differentially recruited into phosphotyrosine complexes in response to insulin stimulation. This study provides evidence for mechanisms by which specificity can be obtained in the PI 3-kinase signaling system. 125I-Protein A, Na125I, [32P]ATP, ECL reagents, and Rainbow protein molecular mass standards were from Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).

Muscle specimens were obtained from the vastus lateralis portion of the quadriceps femoris muscle from 19 healthy male subjects (age: 28.4 ± 0.7 years; weight: 76.6 ± 2.1 kg; height: 181.3 ± 1.9 cm; body mass index: 23.4 ± 0.4 kg/m2; fasting glucose: 4.9 ± 0.2 mm; and serum insulin: 6.9 ± 0.4 microunits/ml). None of the subjects were taking any medication. Following an overnight fast, the subjects reported to the laboratory at 8:30 a.m. A local anesthetic (prilocain hydrochloride, 10 mg/ml) was administered subcutaneously 15 cm above the proximal border of the patella, and a 4-cm incision was made. Two muscle specimens (250 mg each) were excised for in vitroincubation, and smaller muscle strips were prepared as described (29Zierath J.R. Galuska D. Nolte L.A. Thorne A. Smedgaard-Kristensen J.

The muscle specimens were subsequently incubated with inhibitors and insulin as indicated in the figure legends. For measurements of 3-O-methylglucose transport, the buffer contained 5 mm3-O-[3H]methylglucose and 35 mm[14C]mannitol. For glucose transport experiments, the incubations were terminated by snap-freezing the muscle in liquid nitrogen. Thereafter, the muscle samples were rapidly homogenized in ice-cold buffer containing 100 mm NaF and 10 mmEDTA. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 ×g for 1 min. 3-O-Methylglucose transport was calculated as described previously (33Wallberg-Henriksson H. Zetan N. Henriksson J. J. Biol.

For immunoprecipitation experiments, the muscle samples were homogenized on ice in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 2 mm aprotinin, 2 mm leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenates were precleared by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min prior to immunoprecipitation. 10 μl of 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 25 μg of swollen protein A-agarose beads were added to 100 μl of p85α-NSH2 antiserum. The solution was mixed at 4 °C for 4 h, and the beads were collected. Beads were washed with 100 mm Tris, and the antibody was eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 3.0) for 5 min at room temperature. The glycine buffer was collected and neutralized with 10 μl of 1m Tris (pH 8.0). An aliquot of purified antibody (25 μl) was iodinated by sequential addition of 5 μl of NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer (0.5 m, pH 7.4) and 0.5 μCi of Na125I followed by 10 μl of chloramine T (0.5 mg/ml). The reaction was terminated 2 min later by the addition of 300 μl of 25 mmTris (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 1% bovine serum albumin. Nonincorporated 125I was separated from iodinated antibody on a Bio-Rad Econo-Pac 10DG disposable desalting column, and the peak iodinated antibody fraction was used for Western blotting. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were cultured and differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (30Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cells were used 7–11 days after differentiation, and 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake was determined as described previously (30Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activity was determined essentially as described previously (34Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of label from [γ-32P]ATP into phosphatidylinositol was determined, and the lipid product was resolved by thin-layer chromatography and quantitated on a Fuji BAS2000 phosphoimager. Statistical differences between treatments were analyzed using Student's paired t test. The ability of insulin to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity in human skeletal muscle was initially characterized. Muscle was stimulated with insulin at 1000 microunits/ml, a concentration that maximally stimulates glucose transport (data not shown). Insulin stimulation increased PI 3-kinase activity associated with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins 3.3-fold compared with basal levels, with maximal stimulation being achieved 20 min after the addition of insulin (Fig. 1). Insulin increased 3-O-methylglucose transport in muscle strips 2.22-fold (basal: 0.60 ± 0.07 μmol × ml−1 × h−1; insulin: 1.33 ± 0.06 μmol × ml−1 × h−1, n= 10 strips). The insulin-induced increase in 3-O-methylglucose transport was inhibited by LY294002 in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 2.5 μm) (Fig. 2). The inhibition of insulin action on muscle glucose transport by LY294002 very closely matched the effect obtained with this compound on insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2). Immunoblotting studies of whole muscle homogenate using a polyclonal antibody to the SH3 domain of p85α consistently revealed two immunoreactive bands at 85 and 87 kDa (Fig.3 A). Subsequent immunoblotting with isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed that the faster migrating of these (lower band) represented p85α and the slower one (upper band) represented p85β (Fig. 3 B). The polyclonal antibody raised against the N-SH2 domain revealed a prominent immunoreactive protein at 85 kDa corresponding to p85α, but did not recognize p85β. However, this antibody also recognized immunoreactive proteins at 54, 53, 48, and 46 kDa in muscle homogenates. Whereas the relative intensity of the bands varied slightly in samples from different individuals, the 48-kDa protein was consistently the most intense (Fig. 3 A). Identical immunoreactive proteins were recognized by antiserum raised against the same N-SH2 fusion protein in a separate rabbit, but these proteins were not recognized by preimmune serum from either of these rabbits (data not shown). More important, these same immunoreactive proteins were recognized by the monoclonal antibodies recognizing an epitope in the N-SH2 domain (Fig.3 B), but were not recognized by monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies recognizing epitopes in the SH3 domain of p85α (Fig.3 B). The lower molecular mass bands are unlikely to represent a proteolytic product of p85α as the intensity of the bands was not dependent on the inclusion of protease inhibitors in the homogenization mixture and did not change with time of storage. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that the p85α-NSH2 antiserum did not recognize any comparable lower molecular mass bands in homogenates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes or 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (Ref. 30Nave B.T.

Muscle strips were incubated in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 1000 microunits/ml insulin (INS) for 20 min and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal amounts of the homogenates (250 μg) were incubated with PY20 antiphosphotyrosine antibody and protein A-agarose for 1 h, at which time the beads were precipitated by centrifugation. Material was eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and 2% SDS. Samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted as indicated. A, shown is a representative experiment of direct Western blotting of antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (IP's) with iodinated p85α-NSH2 polyclonal antiserum, including a lane containing 100 μg of muscle homogenate and another containing 150 μg of 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysate for comparison.B, bands corresponding to p85α splice variants fromA were quantitated on a BAS2000 phosphoimager. Basal levels are shown by shaded bars, and insulin-stimulated levels are shown by closed bars. Bars represent the mean ± range of duplicate muscle strips. Similar results were obtained in a separate experiment also performed in duplicate.C, shown is a representative Western blot of antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Anti-ptyr IP) with the p85β monoclonal antibody and p55PIK polyclonal antiserum, both visualized using ECL. D, bands corresponding to p85β and p55PIK were quantitated using a Bio-Rad GS670 densitometer and are expressed as band density relative to the band density in the unstimulated state.

In this approach, human muscle homogenates were precipitated with phosphopeptide beads based on the amino acids surrounding Tyr-751 (p85 SH2 domain-binding region) of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. Such phosphopeptide beads have previously been shown to have a high affinity for PI 3-kinase adapter subunits (31Reif K. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10780-10788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Otsu M. Hiles I. Gout I. Fry M.J. Ruiz-Larrea F. Panayotou G. Thompson A. Dhand R. Hsuan J. Totty N. Smith A.D. Morgan S.J. Courtneidge S.A. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 91-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The specificity and selectivity of this approach are demonstrated by the fact that the p50 and p55PIK antibodies used in this study recognize a number of bands in human muscle homogenates, whereas in the eluate from the phosphopeptide beads, this is reduced to a single band. The protein recognized by the p55PIK antiserum in the phosphopeptide bead precipitates is 58 kDa, and the protein recognized by the p50 antiserum is 46 kDa (Fig. 4), which correspond closely with the previously reported molecular masses of these variants in other species (21Pons S. Asano T. Glasheen E. Miralpeix M. Zhang Y. Fisher T.L. Myers M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4453-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 24Inukai K. Funaki M. Ogihara T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7873-7882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The p85β antibody recognizes a single 87-kDa protein in muscle homogenates, and this protein is also present in phosphopeptide beads (Fig. 4 C). Western blotting of the phosphopeptide bead eluates with the p85α-NSH2 antibody revealed protein bands at 85, 54, 53, 48, and 46 kDa, and these were of equal intensity to the corresponding bands seen with this antibody in muscle homogenate (Fig. 4 A). Several other components in the homogenate that were slightly immunoreactive with the p85α-NSH2 antibody were not present in the precipitates and were thus confirmed as nonspecific reactions. PI 3-kinase activity was present in PI 3-kinase adapter subunit antibody immunoprecipitates, confirming that the antibodies were recognizing functional PI 3-kinase adapter subunits. The greatest amount of PI 3-kinase activity was found associated with antibodies specific to p50, with lesser amounts associated with p85α and still lower levels associated with p85β and p55PIK (Fig.5 A). To investigate whether the lower molecular mass protein bands recognized by the p85α-NSH2 antibody were associated with PI 3-kinase activity, serial immunoprecipitations followed by PI 3-kinase activity assays were performed. Total p85α-associated PI 3-kinase activity was immunoprecipitated from muscle homogenates using the p85α-NSH2 antibody (Fig. 5 B). However, immunoprecipitation of an equivalent amount of muscle homogenate with the p85α-SH3 antibody, which recognizes both full-length p85α and p85β but not truncated variants, precipitated a much smaller amount of PI 3-kinase activity. This was not due to inefficient immunoprecipitation as both the p85α-SH3 and p85α-NSH2 antibodies were equally efficient, each being able to precipitate >85% of the full-length p85α protein (data not shown). Furthermore, subsequent immunoprecipitation with the same antibody in the supernatant from the initial p85α-SH3 immunoprecipitation showed that no further PI 3-kinase activity could be immunoprecipitated (data not shown). The p85α-NSH2 antibody, which recognizes truncated adapter subunit forms, was then used to immunoprecipitate PI 3-kinase activity remaining in the supernatant of the p85α-SH3 immunoprecipitates. The amount of PI 3-kinase in these immunoprecipitates was ≈75% of the amount of PI 3-kinase activity directly immunoprecipitated by the p85α-NSH2 antibody from an equivalent amount of homogenate (Fig. 5). This indicates that truncated but functional forms of the PI 3-kinase adapter subunit are present in human skeletal muscle. Overall, the combination of the immunoblotting data, the phosphopeptide bead experiments, and the PI 3-kinase assays in sequential immunoprecipitations provides strong evidence that the 54-, 53-, 48-, and 46-kDa proteins recognized by the p85α-NSH2 antibody in fact represent forms of the PI 3-kinase adapter subunit containing SH2 domains, but not the SH3 domain or Bcr homology domain.

The α2A adrenergic receptor (α2AAR) is directly delivered to the basolateral subdomain; the A1 adenosine receptor (A1AdoR) is apically enriched in its targeting; and the α2BAR subtype is randomly delivered to both domains but selectively retained basolaterally (Keefer, J. R., and Limbird, L. E. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 11340–11347; Saunders, C., Keefer, J. R., Kennedy, A. P., Wells, J. N., and Limbird, L. E. (1996) J. Biol.

The present studies explore the role of the polarized cytoskeleton in localization of G-protein-coupled receptors in MDCK II cells. Nocodazole or colchicine, which disrupt microtubules, did not perturb lateral localization of α2AR subtypes but led to a relocalization the A1AdoR to the basolateral surface, revealed by immunocytochemical and metabolic labeling strategies. Conversely, the apical component of the random delivery of α2BAR was not affected by these agents, suggesting microtubule-dependent and -independent apical targeting mechanisms for G-protein-coupled receptors in polarized cells. Apparent rerouting of the apically targeted A1AdoR was selective for microtubule-disrupting agents, since cytochalasin D, which disrupts actin polymerization, did not alter A1AdoR or α2BAR localization or targeting. These data suggest that multiple apical targeting mechanisms exist for G-protein-coupled receptors and that microtubule-disrupting agents serve as tools to probe their different trafficking mechanisms.

The coordinated and vectorial functioning of polarized cells mediated by endogenous and exogenous ligands depends on the availability of appropriate receptors at the particular surface domains to which the ligand has access.

We have demonstrated that the G-protein-coupled α2AAR is delivered directly to and retained on the basolateral subdomain of renal epithelial cells (1Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the A1AdoR predominantly is apically targeted (65–83%) in renal epithelial cells (2Saunders C. Keefer J.R. Kennedy A.P. Wells J.N. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 995-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The trafficking itineraries of the α2BAR and α2CAR subtypes differ from that of the α2AAR: the α2BAR is randomly delivered to both the apical and basolateral domains but selectively retained basolaterally; the α2CAR is directly delivered basolaterally, but a substantial fraction of the receptor population remains in a cytoplasmic compartment at steady state (3Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These different targeting itineraries are summarized in Fig. 1.Figure 2The steady-state localization of heterologously expressed GPCR in the absence or presence of cytoskeletal disrupting drugs. MDCK II cells expressing GPCR were grown in Transwell culture for one week to ensure a polarized phenotype. For experiments, the cells were treated overnight with or without colchicine (10 μm), nocodazole (33 μm), or cytochalasin D (2 μm). Before beginning the immunocytochemistry, the integrity of the monolayer was assessed by assaying for the transepithelial leak of [3H]methoxyinulin from the apical to the basolateral compartment after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C. A leak greater than 3% was excluded from the study (except for cytochalasin D, where leaks often were 5–8%). The cells were then stained on their Transwell filter supports, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and analyzed by confocal microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Nocodazole and colchicine reverse the polarity of apically delivered A1AdoR. A, MDCK II cells expressing epitope-tagged A1AdoR grown in Transwell culture in the presence of A1AdoR antagonists (see “Experimental Procedures”) were metabolically labeled with 1 μCi/μl of [35S]Met/Cys protein labeling mix (150 μl) for 1 h in the absence or presence of nocodazole (33 μm) and then harvested and processed using sequential immunoprecipitation and streptavidin-agarose chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The autoradiogram shown is for an SDS-polyacrylamide gel exposed for 3 weeks to Kodak X-Omat film between two Quanta III screens at −70 °C. Gel slices corresponding to the position of the A1AdoR signal on autoradiograms were excised and counted in 10 ml of NEN-963 scintillation fluid in a β-scintillation counter. In this representative autoradiogram, under control conditions, the apical:basolateral ratio for A1AdoR was 70:30; in the presence of nocodazole, it was 40:60. The findings from multiple individual experiments are summarized as follows. The mean apical:basolateral ratio under control conditions was 68:32, and for nocodazole treatment it was 44:56 (n = 5).B, MDCK II cells expressing epitope-tagged A1AdoR grown in Transwell culture were metabolically labeled in the absence or presence of colchicine (10 μm) with 1 μCi/μl of [35S]Met/Cys protein labeling mix (150 μl) for 1 h and then processed as in Fig. 5 A. In this representative autoradiogram, the apical:basolateral ratio A1AdoR under control conditions was 63:37; in the presence of colchicine, it was 45:55. The mean apical:basolateral ratio under control conditions was 62:38, and for colchicine treatment it was 42:58 (n = 2). C, the retention time of the A1AdoR on the apical surface in the presence of microtubule-disrupting agents was not significantly different from control. The loss of the receptor from the apical surface in the presence or absence of colchicine or nocodazole was assessed by means of “pulse-chase” experiments. MDCK II cells expressing epitope-tagged A1AdoR grown in Transwell culture were metabolically labeled in the absence or presence of colchicine (10 μm) or nocodazole (33 μm) with 1 μCi/μl [35S]Met/Cys protein labeling mix for 1 h, chased for 8 (t 0) and then 20 h (t 1), and then processed as in Fig.5 A. This was done twice for each drug at these time points. The ranges of the percentage remaining on the apical surface at 20 h were as follows: 50–67% (average, 57.3%; n = 3) for untreated (control) conditions, 51–79% (average, 65%;n = 2) in the presence of colchicine, and 57–58% (average, 57.5%; n = 2) in the presence of nocodazole.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Polarized localization of cytoskeletal elements (A) and GPCR (B) in MDCK II cells. A, a schematic diagram showing the structurally and functionally distinct apical and basolateral surface membrane domains and their relationship to the polarized cytoskeleton. The tight actin-rich network of microfilaments is close to the microvilli of the apical domain of the cell. Randomly organized microtubules also underlie the apical surface domain; the apical surface is denoted by the wavy line at the top of the cell shown. Polarized microtubules run vertically along the lateral surface domain of the cell, with the minus ends of the microtubule facing the apical surface and the plus ends facing the basal region of the cell. Polarized microtubules “grow” from the minus end toward the plus end. γ-Tubulin binds α/β-tubulin heterodimers, the former thus serving as a nucleation site onto which tubulin dimers assemble (10Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss, New York, NY1994: 33-45Google Scholar). The cortical cytoskeleton underlying the lateral subdomain is composed of fodrin (non-erythrocyte spectrin) and ankyrin, which often serves to tether transmembrane proteins to this lateral scaffold. B, polarization of GPCR in MDCK II cells. Previous studies reveal that the Gi/Go-coupled subtypes achieve basolateral localization by differing trafficking itineraries (1Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 763-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the Gi/Go-coupled A1AdoR is preferentially targeted to and sustained on the apical surface by a direct targeting mechanism (2Saunders C. Keefer J.R. Kennedy A.P. Wells J.N. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 995-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that these four GPCR serve as unique reagents to explore the role of the polarized cytoskeleton on GPCR trafficking and polarization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Like receptors, including the GPCR described above, the cytoskeleton in a polarized cell also is nonuniformly distributed (Fig.1 A). It is thought that this disparate distribution of cytoskeletal proteins contributes to the polarized compartmentalization of proteins, since the development of a functionally and structurally polarized phenotype is paralleled by cytoskeletal polarization (4Nelson W.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 375-385Google Scholar). In MDCK II cells grown in polarized culture, Ca2+-dependent induction of cell-cell contacts via E-cadherin leads to a gradual reduction of actin microfilaments on the basal surface and their apical enrichment, in parallel with an increased stability (and polarization) of microtubules, and an alignment of ankyrin and fodrin under the lateral subdomain (4Nelson W.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 375-385Google Scholar). Since apical versus basolateral targeting of membrane proteins appears to involve discrete post-trans-Golgi network vesicular populations (5Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), it is not surprising that different cytoskeletal elements also have been implicated in this differential transport of apically versus basolaterally targeted vesicles (e.g. see Refs. 11Lafont F. Burkhardt J.K. Simons K. Nature. 1994; 372: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 12Matter K. Bucher K. Hauri H.-P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23641-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To date, however, the role of the cytoskeleton in the trafficking of GPCR has not been explored. The present studies examine the impact of cytoskeletal disrupting agents on the localization and delivery of GPCR targeted to different surfaces in polarized cells. We examined the effect of agents that disrupt the cytoskeleton (colchicine, nocodazole, cytochalasin D) or vesicular transport (monensin, brefeldin A) on the steady-state localization and delivery of basolaterally targeted α2AAR and α2CAR, the randomly delivered but basolaterally retained α2BAR, and the apically targeted A1AdoR. We postulated that the use of cytoskeletal agents in combination with the study of GPCR possessing varying trafficking itineraries (2Saunders C. Keefer J.R. Kennedy A.P. Wells J.N. Limbird L.E. J.

The present data provide evidence that apical delivery of the A1AdoR and α2BAR occurs by microtubule-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively, and that cytoskeletal disrupting agents may be valuable tools for elucidating distinct direct apical delivery pathways as well as the molecular mechanisms that govern them. 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-di-[2,3-3H]propylxanthine ([3H]DPCPX) (109 Ci/mmol), 35S-Express protein labeling mixture (1200 Ci/mmol), [3H]methoxyinulin (125.6 mCi/g), and [α-35S]dATP (1389 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products.

Nocodazole, monensin, colchicine, and lumicolchicine were from Sigma; cytochalasin D and brefeldin A were from Calbiochem. MDCK II cells were maintained as described previously (2Saunders C.

For polarity experiments, MDCK II cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/24.5-mm polycarbonate membrane filter (Transwell chambers, 0.4-μm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA), and cultured for 5–8 days with medium changes every day. The A1AdoR-expressing cell lines were grown in the presence of the receptor antagonists, 60 μm theophylline and 100 μm 1,3-dipropyl-8-(4-sulfophenyl)xanthine, since previous studies had demonstrated that, if grown in their absence, A1AdoR-expressing cells grew as multicellular layers in Transwell culture (2Saunders C. Keefer J.R. Kennedy A.P. Wells J.N. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 995-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Prior to each experiment, the integrity of the monolayer was assessed by monitoring [3H]methoxyinulin leak (1Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Permanent clonal cell lines of MDCK II cells were developed as described previously (1Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

In each case, the first 9 amino acids after the initiating methionine encode a hemagglutinin epitope (9Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) recognized by the commercially available monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Babco). The clonal cell lines evaluated in the present study include TAG-α2AAR (25 and 7 pmol/mg of protein), TAG-α2BAR (10 and 3 pmol/mg of protein), TAG-α2CAR (5 and 3 pmol/mg of protein) and TAG-A1AdoR (37 pmol/mg of protein). The α2AAR subtype was encoded by a porcine cDNA, the α2BAR and α2CAR subtypes were encoded by a rat cDNA, and the A1AdoR was encoded by a canine cDNA. The species origin does not alter the trafficking patterns of these receptors. For example, the porcine α2AAR is targeted directly to the basolateral surface in both canine MDCK II and porcine LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells (1Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the canine A1AdoR is targeted apically in both MDCK II and LLC-PKI cells (2Saunders C. Keefer J.R. Kennedy A.P. Wells J.N. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 995-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MDCK II particulate preparations were prepared essentially as described (1Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A1AdoR were identified using [3H]DPCPX (2Saunders C. Keefer J.R. Kennedy A.P. Wells J.N. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 995-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and α2AR were identified with [3H]rauwolscine (1Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as described previously. Colchicine is a microtubule-disrupting drug that binds slowly to soluble tubulin heterodimers, reducing them to large aggregates and rendering them incapable of polymerization for microtubule growth (10Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss, New York, NY1994: 33-45Google Scholar). Most incubations with colchicine were performed for 15 h, since the half-life of all four GPCR studied on their enriched membrane surfaces is 10–12 h. Thus, a 15-h incubation with colchicine permitted us to evaluate the localization of receptors already delivered to the cell surface and those that were under synthesis and delivery. Previous reports have established that increased time of incubation with colchicine beyond 4–6 h does not lead to nonspecific mechanisms for this agent (11Lafont F. Burkhardt J.K. Simons K. Nature. 1994; 372: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 12Matter K. Bucher K. Hauri H.-P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3163-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We conducted a time course of the steady-state localization of the A1AdoR-expressing cell line in the presence of 10 μm colchicine; the appearance of the A1AdoR on the lateral surface was evident after only 4 h of treatment and was maximal at 18 h (data not shown). Even at 18 h, however, some trace apical staining of A1AdoR was detectable (see “Results”), which could be due to incomplete microtubule disruption, incomplete turnover of the already delivered receptor population, or a microtubule-insensitive fraction of apically delivered receptor. Immunocytochemical analysis of treated cells using an anti β-tubulin antibody confirmed that colchicine treatment of cells had indeed disrupted the microtubule network. Since a change in MDCK II cell morphology was noted after 24–48 h of colchicine treatment, these longer incubations were not used in the present studies. Nocodazole disrupts microtubules via a molecular mechanism different from that of colchicine (10Hyams J.S. Lloyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss, New York, NY1994: 33-45Google Scholar). Nocodazole binds rapidly to microtubule subunits and prevents heterodimers from repolymerizing, at either 37 or 4 °C. Incubation at 4 °C accelerates nocodazole-effected depolymerization, at least in MDCK (7Ojakian G.K. Schwimmer R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and Caco-2 (12Matter K. Bucher K. Hauri H.-P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3163-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) cells. MDCK II cells in Transwell culture were treated for 15 h, as described above for colchicine. Just as for colchicine, the ability of nocodazole treatment to disrupt microtubules was confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis with the anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Amersham). The effects of nocodazole (33 μm, equivalent to 10 μg/ml) on GPCR delivery to the cell surface were performed as follows, based on earlier reports for nocodazole treatment in MDCK cells (18Arreaza G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23641-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar): on the day of the experiment, medium was replaced with 4 °C medium and incubated for 30 min, followed by 4 °C Cys/Met-free medium with or without nocodazole for 1 h, followed by 37 °C Cys/Met-free medium with or without nocodazole for 1–1.5 h, followed by [35S]Cys/Met metabolic labeling at 37 °C for the desired “pulse” time with or without nocodazole. The actin polymerization inhibitor, cytochalasin D (2 μm), was incubated with polarized MDCK II cells for 15 h prior to fixation and immunocytochemical analysis. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton was confirmed by staining control and treated cells with rhodamine phalloidin, which reveals the actin network. BFA is a fungal metabolite that has been shown to fuse the endoplasmic reticulum with the cis, medial, and trans cisternae of the Golgi apparatus but not with the trans-Golgi network (13Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BFA has been demonstrated to both enhance transcytosis (14Prydz K. Hansen S.H.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or targeting (17Low S.H. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and was tested in these studies to explore the possible contribution of the transcytotic pathway to the apical delivery of A1AdoR and/or the apical component of the random delivery of α2BAR. Brefeldin A was added to a final concentration of 3.5 μm, as described previously for MDCK II cells (18Arreaza G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23641-23647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Low S.H. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Tan P. Subramaniam V.N. Hong W. J. Biol.

Although multiple intracellular consequences of monensin treatment might be expected, most widely reported are the effects of monensin to block cell surface receptor recycling of internalized molecules to the cell surface (20Basu S.K.

Except when indicated otherwise, the antibody-containing and antibody wash buffers contained 0.1% Triton X-100, to permit detection of epitope either on the cell surface or in the cell interior. Treatment with the secondary Cy3 conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200) was performed as described (2Saunders C. Keefer J.R. Kennedy A.P. Wells J.N. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

The samples were first visualized in thexy plane and then in the xz plane. In the images shown, the bottom ¾ represent the xy plane, the conventional view of the cells as one looks down upon them. Thewhite line that is shown in the xy plane confocal images indicates where the laser took a cross-section of the cells to generate the z scan. The top ¼ of the images represents the xz plane (or z scan), the cortical section perpendicular to the plane of the cell layer. Images were analyzed using Showcase software on a Silicon Graphics Iris Indigo workstation. The amount of newly synthesized receptor delivered to the apicalversus basolateral surface of polarized, metabolically labeled MDCK II cells grown in Transwell culture was quantified by surface biotinylation of either the apical or basolateral surface with NHS-biotin followed by isolation of radiolabeled receptor on the biotinylated surface by sequential Protein A- and streptavidin-agarose chromatography. These procedures were performed essentially as described (1Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

RA activates retinoic acid receptors (RARs), whereas 9-cis-RA activates both RARs and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). Both classes of receptors function as ligand-dependent transcription factors. S91 melanoma cells contain mRNA for RXRα, RXRβ, RARα, RARγ, and RARβ in low levels. Among these, only RARβ gene transcription is induced by retinoids. However, at present the individual role(s) for each RXR and RAR isoform in these processes is unclear. We assessed the function of all isoforms in the S91 melanoma model by using RXR and RAR isoform-specific retinoids to study their effects on cell growth, RARβ expression, and differentiation. Activation of each of the endogenous RXR or RAR isoforms induces RARβ gene expression, and blocks cellular proliferation. However, only the RARγ-ligands cause additional differentiation toward a melanocytic phenotype, which coincides with substantial apoptosis well before morphological changes are apparent. Apoptosis is completely dependent on de novo protein synthesis but cannot be induced by changes in activities of AP-1, protein kinase C, and protein kinase A, nor can it be blocked by the presence of the antioxidant glutathione. These results argue against a specific role for RARβ, but suggest that RARγ has a critical role in a genetic switch between melanocytes and melanoma, and induction of ligand-dependent apoptosis.

There are three separate genes (α, β, and γ) for each class of retinoid receptors, respectively, and multiple splice variants exist (3Glass C.K. DiRenzo J. Kurokawa R. Han Z.H. DNA Cell.

Ligand-bound receptors can modulate the expression of genes containing appropriate response elements (RA response element, RARE). A productive RARE generally consists of the direct repeat AGGTCA spaced by two or five nucleotides (DR2 and DR5, respectively), although other functional configurations exist (Ref. 1Glass C.K.

A correlation was observed between retinoid-dependent induction of the RARβ gene and growth arrest, indicating that RARβ might be involved (23Clifford J.L. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Lotan R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1546-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The RARβ promoter contains a typical RARE (βRARE) of the DR5 type (28de The H. Ruiz Vivanco M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17429-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, it is difficult to assess the importance of individual RAR isoforms and RXRs in the above described processes using pan-RAR and pan-RAR-RXR agonists like RA and 9-cis-RA, respectively. A more detailed comprehension of the underlying molecular events leading to neoplastic change in this model would be advantageous to our basic understanding of cancer, and it might benefit the development of improved therapies (31McBurney M.W. Costa S. Pratt M.A. Cancer Invest. 1993; 11: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We set out to answer these questions by using a number of RXR and RAR isoform-specific agonists to evaluate their effects on cell growth, RARβ expression, and morphological differentiation. Our results suggest that all receptors can induce growth arrest and transcriptional activation of the RARβ gene. In contrast, only the RARγ ligands cause morphological differentiation which, interestingly, occurs concomitantly with substantial apoptosis well before phenotypic changes become apparent. The mechanism of apoptosis is dependent on newly synthesized proteins, suggesting that new gene transcription is a necessary prerequisite. Changes in activities of AP-1, PKC, or PKA do not lead to apoptosis, whereas high concentrations of the free oxygen radical scavenger glutathione (GSH) do not block RARγ agonist-induced cell death. These results suggests that redundant mechanism(s) inhibit cellular proliferation and RARβ expression. Activation of the RARβ promoter and/or receptor is not a necessary condition for growth arrest in these cells. It also shows that there is no default mechanism leading to phenotypic differentiation after growth arrest. Instead, only RARγ appears to be able to activate the differentiation program, and induce ligand-dependent apoptosis. All tissue culture plates and flasks were from Costar (Cambridge, MA). S91 cells (ATTC CCL 53.1) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in humidified air. Retinoid stock solutions (10 or 1 mm in Me2SO) were added to media to achieve the desired concentration. Final Me2SO concentrations in cell culture medium never exceeded 0.1% (v/v). For the cell proliferation assay, cells were seeded at a density of about 7,500 cells/well in triplicate in 96-well plates, and treated for 5 days in total with the indicated retinoids. Media with/without retinoids was changed every 24 h. At the fifth day, relative viable cell numbers were obtained using the CellTiter 96TMAQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Absorbance at 490 nm was determined in a UV max kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA). Morphology of cells was monitored on an Olympus IMT-2 phase-contrast microscope, and photographed through an attached Olympus OM-2s program camera (Tokyo, Japan) on Kodak T-Max 400 film (Rochester, NY). A plasmid with a 4.4-kilobase chromosomal fragment containing the RARβ2 promoter linked to the luciferase (Luc) gene, pW1RARβ2pr-lucif (32Underhill T.M. Cash D.E. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 274-285PubMed Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. E. Linney with permission of Dr. P. Chambon. Dr. Chambon also provided us with pSGRARβ2 (33Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Plasmids were grown in Escherichia colistrain DH5α in LB media with ampicillin, and purified using a Qiagen plasmid maxi kit (Chatsworth, CA). For the transfection with pW1RARβ2pr-lucif, cells were grown in large flasks (165 cm2) until 75% confluent. Per flask, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed in ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and incubated for 5 min on ice with 40 μg of pW1RARβ2pr-lucif and 12 μg of CH110 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). CH110 constitutively expresses β-galactosidase activity which serves as an internal control for the transfection efficiency. Cells were then electroporated using a Electroporator II (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) set at 200 V, 1000 microfarads, incubated on ice for 10 min, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C, and plated on a 6-well plate. After 36 h, cells were treated with retinoids and harvested 12 h later. Luciferase assays and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (34Spanjaard R.A. Nguyen V.P. Chin W.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 286-295PubMed Google Scholar). Values from the luciferase assay were normalized for β-galactosidase activity. Fold induction means normalized luciferase activity in the presence of retinoid/normalized luciferase activity in the absence of retinoid (control, Me2SO). Cells were grown in 150-cm2 plates until 75% confluent. Medium was changed containing the appropriate amounts of retinoid or control (Me2SO), and/or 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Cells were harvested after 8 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and poly(A)+ mRNA extracted using a Qiagen Direct mRNA Midi Kit (Chatsworth, CA). Two μg of mRNA was subjected to electrophoresis through a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel (1%). Blotting procedures, hybridization/washing conditions, preparation of radioactively labeled probe, and quantitation were all performed as described (25Spanjaard R.A. Sugawara A. Ikeda M. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17429-17436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cyclophilin probe serves as internal control for loading and blotting, and used to normalize values obtained from the RARβ probe. Fold-induction means normalized value of RARβ probe (in the presence of retinoid and presence or absence of cycloheximide)/value of RARβ probe (in the absence of retinoid and absence of cycloheximide). Cells were grown in 10-cm plates, and treated for 5 days with the required amount of indicated retinoids or control (Me2SO). Medium with/without retinoids was changed every 24 h. Adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. 2 × 104 cells were pelleted and lysed overnight in 100 μl, 1 n KOH at 80 °C, and absorbance at 490 nm was determined. Cells were grown until 50% confluent in 10-cm plates and treated for 24 h with the indicated retinoids. 4 × 106 cells (adherent and floating) were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and pellets were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% (w/v) Sarcosyl, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) for 3 h at 50 °C. Next, protein was removed by treatment with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:48:2), and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1). DNA was precipitated, dissolved in 100 μl of TE buffer with 0.25 mg/ml RNase A, and incubated at 50 °C for 1 h followed by 1 h at 37 °C. 25 μl were then loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel in TAE buffer with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and separated by electrophoresis. DNA was visualized by UV light at 305 nmand photographed. Cells were grown in 6-well plates, and adherent and floating cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and counted. Pelleted cells were then treated following the manufacturer's protocol with the Cell Death Detection ELISA (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). 1,000 cells were used in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and absorbance was determined at 405 nm in a UV max kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Equilibrium dissociation constants (K dvalues) for the interaction of the different retinoids with the three RAR isoforms were determined in vitro at 4 °C by measuring displacement of radiolabeled reference retinoid CD367 by increasing dose of non-radioactive ligands. The assays were performed as described before, using RARs that were obtained by overexpression in COS-7 cells (35Martin B. Bernardon J.M. Cavey M.T. Bernard B. Carlavan I. Charpentier B. Pilgrim W.R. Shroot B. Reichert U. Skin Pharmacol. 1992; 5: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). At least three independent determinations for binding were performed. The average standard error of the mean was within 25%.K d values and RXR-specific transactivation properties of the pan-RXR ligand CD2624 were described previously (36Beard R.L. Colon D.F. Song T.K.

All retinoids were kept as 30 mm stock solutions in Me2SO, and kept at −20 °C to −80 °C. For the studies described here, we selected the following synthetic retinoids (listed in TableI), and determined their K d values for each RAR isoform (35Martin B. Bernardon J.M. Cavey M.T. Bernard B. Carlavan I. Charpentier B. Pilgrim W.R. Shroot B. Reichert U. Skin Pharmacol. 1992; 5: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar): Am80 and Am580, which have a strong preference for RARα; CD417 and CD2314, which are selective for RARβ; CD437 (also named SR11248 or AHPN) and CD2325, which bind to RARγ. These results are generally in good agreement with their transactivational properties as reported previously (39Bernard B.A. Bernardon J.M. Delescluse C. Martin B. Lenoir M.C. Maignan J.

Bernard B.A. Reichert U. Maignan J. Darmon M. Shroot B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 556-562PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we used CD2624, which binds and activates all RXR isoforms, but not RARs (36Beard R.L. Colon D.F. Song T.K. Davies P.J. Kochhar D.M. Chandraratna R.A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 3556-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). First, the efficacy of these retinoids in inducing growth arrest was examined. Cells were treated for 5 days with different concentrations of retinoids with or without CD2624 as indicated (Fig.1), or CD2624 alone, to study the effects of single activated RAR isoforms in the presence or absence of activated RXR, respectively. After the last day, relative cell numbers were obtained by means of a colorimetric assay, in which the absorbance at 490 nm directly correlates with the number of viable cells. The absorbance values of control-treated cells was arbitrarily set at 100%, and all other values were normalized accordingly. Media and retinoids were changed every 24 h to minimize loss of concentration of intact ligands due to chemical decomposition, as well as to minimize potential aberrant specificities by those byproducts (41Boylan J.F. Lufkin T. Achkar C.C. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 843-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, all compounds cause growth arrest or a decrease in viable cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The RARα and RARγ compounds have an IC50 of about 10−7m, and the RARβ and RXR compounds about 10−6m. Human melanoma cells appear to have the same sensitivity profile for some of these compounds (42Schadendorf D. Worm M. Jurgovsky K. Dippel E. Reichert U. Czarnetzki B. Recent Results Cancer Res. 1995; 139: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Simultaneous addition of RAR and RXR ligands renders the cells about 10-fold more sensitive, indicative of a synergistic rather than an additive effect. These results suggests that all RARs and RXRα and/or RXRβ can, directly or indirectly, inhibit cellular proliferation. Because RARβ has been implicated in the above described processes, we next studied the induction of the RARβ gene by two different methods. Transcription of this gene is rapidly induced by RA (within 2 h), even in the absence of protein synthesis (23Clifford J.L. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Lotan R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1546-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Redfern C.P. Daly A.K. Latham J.A. Todd C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid, pW1RARβ2pr-lucif, which contains the chromosomal fragment harboring the RARβ2 promoter linked to the luciferase (Luc) gene (32Underhill T.M. Cash D.E. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 274-285PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of this promoter is then detected as enzymatic luciferase activity in the cell extract (Fig.2 A). Three concentrations of each ligand were chosen, varying between 10−8 and 10−5m, based on their displayed efficacy in the cell proliferation assay. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were exposed to all ligands for an additional 12 h because this is the earliest time point at which significant luciferase activity could be detected (data not shown). Fig. 2 A shows that the promoter is activated by all ligands, including CD2624, in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum induction levels are generally reached between 6- and 15-fold at 10−7 and 10−6m. These data correlate well with their activity in the cell proliferation assay, and suggest that all expressed receptors can activate this promoter. The second method measures induction of the endogenous promoter. Cells were treated for 8 h with a representative group of retinoids at a concentration of 10−6m for maximum induction. In addition, cells were incubated at the same time in the absence or presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide to test whether induction is dependent on on-going protein synthesis. After treatment, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and RARβ mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). We again see that the RARβ gene is rapidly induced by all tested agonists. Also, the level of induction (10–15-fold) corresponds well with the values found in the transfection assay. Thus, regulation of expression of this gene can be mediated by ligands specific for all receptors, including RXRα and/or RXRβ. The latter result confirms our previous report that RXR can transcriptionally activate this promoter despite its unfavorable (to RXRs) βRARE (28de The H. Ruiz Vivanco M.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 29Hoffmann B. Lehmann J.M. Zhang X.K. Hermann T. Husmann M. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Mol.

A. 1990; 87: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B also shows that cycloheximide does not abrogate transcription of this gene. This suggests that all receptors, including RARβ whose mRNA levels are very low (but still detectable) in the absence of added retinoids (Fig.2 B and Refs. 23Clifford J.L. Petk"

Edwards P.A. Keller G.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14165-14169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, IPP isomerase is presumed to have a cytosolic localization (1Spurgeon S.L. Porter J.W. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 2-46Google Scholar); however, the following three observations have led us to believe that the enzyme is localized to peroxisomes: (i) in permeabilized cells lacking cytosolic components, mevalonate can be converted to cholesterol in equal amounts to that observed in nonpermeabilized cells, therefore suggesting that the cytosol does not contain enzymes necessary for the conversion of mevalonate to FPP (12Biardi L. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1784-1788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); (ii) IPP isomerase activity in tissues from patients with peroxisome-deficient diseases (Zellweger and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy) is 50% of that found in tissues from control patients (13Krisans S.K. Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. Keller G.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14165-14169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) the deduced amino acid sequence from the human isomerase cDNA, which has been recently cloned (14Xuan J. Kowalski J. Chambers A.F. Denhardt D.T. Genomics. 1994; 20: 128-131Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and characterized (15Hahn F.M. Xuan J.W. Chambers A.F. Poulter C.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), contains two putative peroxisomal targeting sequences. At the C-terminal end of human isomerase is a putative peroxisomal targeting sequence 1 (PTS1) consisting of YRM (single-letter amino acid notation), and at the N-terminal end is a putative PTS2 sequence consisting of HLX 5QL (where Xdesignates any amino acid). The consensus sequence for the PTS1 motif is (S/A/C)(K/H/R)(L/M) (16Subramani S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); however, many tripeptide combinations that do not adhere to this consensus sequence were able to targetSaccharomyces cerivisiae malate dehydrogenase to yeast peroxisomes (17Elgersma Y. Vos A. van den Berg M. van Roermund C.W.T. van der Sluijs P. Distel B. Tabak H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26375-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The PTS2 consensus sequence is usually near the N-terminal end of the protein and is the nonapeptide (R/K)(L/V/I)X 5(H/Q)(L/A) (18Rachubinski R.A. Subramani S. Cell. 1995; 83: 525-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this study, we have cloned the rat and hamster homologues of IPP isomerase and identified the signal that targets this enzyme to peroxisomes. In addition, we demonstrate that IPP isomerase is regulated at the mRNA level in liver from rats treated with compounds known to modulate the levels of cholesterol biosynthesis. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Chemically competentEscherichia coli InvαF′, electrocompetent E. coli TOP10F′, molecular weight markers, TA cloning kit, cDNA synthesis copy kit, and all cloning and expression vectors were obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Microbiological reagents were from Difco. Cholestyramine (Questran) was obtained from Bristol Laboratories. Automated DNA sequencing was performed, and DNA synthetic oligonucleotides were synthesized by the SDSU Microchemical Core Facility (San Diego, CA). The 5′ RACE kit was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and used according to the provided instructions. DNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Nick Translation kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Zeta Probe GT membrane (used for Northern and Southern analysis), C/P Lift membrane (used for plasmid library screening), and Trans-Blot transfer medium (used for Western analysis) were purchased from Bio-Rad. Western transfer was performed as described (11Biardi L. Sreedhar A. Zokaei A. Vartak N.B. Bozeat R.L. Shackelford J.E. Keller G.-A. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern and Southern transfers were performed using the Stratagene Posiblot pressure blotter and pressure control station (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Hybridization conditions for Northern analysis, Southern analysis, or plasmid library screening were as follows. Membranes were incubated overnight at a temperature of 50 °C with radiolabeled probe in a solution of 50% formamide, 6% SDS, 100 mmNa2PO4, and 200 mm NaCl; membranes were washed for 15 min, three times, at 55 °C using 0.1% SDS and 0.5 × SSC, and exposed on a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). Standard molecular biology techniques (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were routinely used for cloning and restriction endonuclease digestions. Plasmid mini- and large scale preps were performed using QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit and Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit, respectively (Qiagen). DNA or RNA purifications from agarose gels were performed using the Gene Clean kit (Bio 101). Secondary antibodies used in immunofluorescence were from Molecular Probes. Anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was from Boehringer Mannheim. All other biochemicals were purchased from Sigma. Where stated, DNA amplification was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In these experiments, the reaction mixture contained 5 μL of 10 ×Taq polymerase PCR buffer (Boehringer Mannheim); deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 200 μm; DNA oligonucleotide primers, 0.2 mm; template DNA, 30 ng (except for 5′ RACE, where templates were added as per kit instructions); and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. Thermocycling conditions were as follows: initial denature, 94 °C for 3 min; 40 rounds of cycling, 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 50 s; final extension, 72 °C for 10 min. The reactions were performed in a Perkin-Elmer 2400 thermocycler. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–240 g) and a New Zealand White rabbit were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Three rats each were fed the standard laboratory diet; or a diet supplemented with a combination of 5.0% cholestyramine for 2 days followed by 5.0% cholestyramine plus 0.1% mevinolin for 3 days; or the standard diet supplemented with 2% cholesterol for 15 days. Rats were not fasted prior to decapitation (4–6 h into light cycle), and 6.0 g of liver were extracted from each rat; 2.0 g used for total RNA and subsequent poly(A)+ RNA isolation, and 4.0 g were used for preparation of liver homogenates. Rat liver poly(A)+ RNA from cholestyramine plus mevinolin (C+M) fed rats was used to construct an oligo(dT)-primed, bidirectional phagemid cDNA library as per the Copy Kit cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). A 667-bp PCR product amplified from C+M rat liver cDNA using the primers Av71 (5′-TAA CCA CCT CGA GAA GCA ACA GGT TC-3′) and Kp711 (5′-TCA CAT TCG GTA CCT TTT CTC ATG GTC-3′) was used as a probe to screen approximately 500,000 colonies from a rat liver cDNA library. Four clones were isolated and sequenced (both strands in triplicate), all of which were identical with the exception of the length of the 5′ untranslated region (UTR). To determine the longest 5′ UTR, 5′ RACE was performed using primer Kp711 as GSP1 and degenerate primer E207 (5′-ATR TAR TCD ATY TCR TGY TC-3′) as GSP2. The full-length hamster CHO K1 clone (termed pHamIPPI) was obtained by assembling the 5′ and 3′ RACE products amplified from CHO K1 poly(A)+ RNA. 5′ RACE on the CHO K1 template was performed using primer H993R (5′-TGC CTA TTC ATC ACA CTC ATC CT-3′) as GSP1 and primer Kp711 as GSP2. The 3′ RACE was performed identically to the 5′ RACE except 1 μg of CHO K1 poly(A)+ RNA was primed with oligonucleotide TUP (5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT AC(T)16-3′), reverse transcribed, then subsequently amplified by PCR using primer set UAP20 (5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT AC-3′) and Av71. Both strands of all subcloned fragments were sequenced in triplicate. Total RNA was prepared from nine individual rat livers by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar). Extraction of poly(A)+ RNA was done using oligo(dT)-cellulose type 3 (Collaborative Biomedical Products) according to the supplier's protocol. For each lane, 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were electrophoresed through a 1.0% agarose gel. The gel was transferred to nylon membrane and cross-linked in a Stratagene Crosslinker according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane was probed with a [32P]dCTP-labeled 667-bp isomerase PCR product. Genomic DNA was purified from rat liver using the QIAamp tissue kit (QIAGEN), and 15 μg of DNA were digested with each indicated restriction enzyme. The samples were electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was transferred to nylon, and the membrane was cross-linked using a Stratagene Crosslinker. The blot was probed with a radiolabeled 180-bpNcoI/BamHI restriction fragment of rat IPP isomerase. A 280-bpNcoI digestion product of rat isomerase was subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pThioHisB. The vector was transformed into TOP10 E. coli, and a single colony was grown overnight at 37 °C in 10 ml LB + ampicillin media. The overnight culture was then added to 1 liter of LB + ampicillin media and grown for 3 h. Ispropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was grown for an additional 4.5 h. The bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended at a 10 × concentration in PBS, and treated with 4 successive freeze/thaw sonications. DNase I was added to a final concentration of 0.5 unit/ml, and the sample was centrifuged. The lysate supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed once with RIPA buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 100 mmNaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.01% NaN3). After centrifugation, the pellet was then washed three times with PBS + 0.1% SDS. The remaining pellet was solubilized as described (11Biardi L. Sreedhar A. Zokaei A. Vartak N.B. Bozeat R.L. Shackelford J.E. Keller G.-A. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins in the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. The band corresponding to the thioredoxin-isomerase fusion protein was excised and electroeluted using a Centricon-10 and Centrilutor apparatus (Amicon), followed by concentration and equilibration in PBS in the Centricon-10. Antibodies were raised in a rabbit. Following collection of preimmune serum, the rabbit received 0.1 mg of electroeluted thioredoxin-isomerase fusion protein that was emulsified 2:1 with Hunter's Titer Max (CytRx Corp.) and injected intramuscularly at two sites. After 1 month, the rabbit was given a second set of injections. One month after the second set of injections, blood was taken, and serum was recovered. Livers from the rats fed a cholestyramine plus mevinolin diet, normal diet, and cholesterol diet (each in triplicate) were homogenized in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% ethanol, containing 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, 0.1m dithiothreitol, 20 mm leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5, at 4 °C). The protein concentration of the homogenate was determined by the BCA method (Pierce Chemical Co.) using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and 200 μg of protein from each sample were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described (20Parker R.A. Miller S.J. Gibson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4877-4887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (11Biardi L. Sreedhar A. Zokaei A. Vartak N.B. Bozeat R.L. Shackelford J.E. Keller G.-A. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-thioredoxin-isomerase antiserum was added at a 1:1000 dilution, and the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase protein A conjugate) was used at a 1:5000 dilution. The blot was then processed using the ECL kit (Amersham). Two DNA oligonucleotides were used to introduce the HA epitope into the hamster isomerase. The first primer, termed COFRev (5′-ATC AGGGACGTC ATA AGG GTA AAT TCG TGT TAG ATA ATG C-3′, AatII underlined) was used in conjunction with primer T7 (5′-AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG-3′) to PCR-amplify a 522-bp region using the full-length clone, pHamIPPI, as template for the reaction. The product was TA cloned (pCR2.1), and the resulting vector was termed pCOFRT7. The second primer, COFFor (5′-TAC TAT GACGTC CCT GAC TAT GCT TGG GGT GAA CAT GAA ATT GAT T-3′, AatII underlined) was used in conjunction with primer M13Rev (5′-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG ACC-3′) to PCR amplify a 2014-bp region using pHamIPPI as template. The product was double digested with KpnI and AatII, gel purified, and ligated into pCOFRT7, which had been previously cut withAatII and KpnI. The resulting construct contained a DNA sequence such that, when translated, would code for the amino acids P136, Y137, D138, V139, P140, D141, Y142, and A143 instead of the native isomerase amino acids Y136, K137, A138, Q139, S140, D141, G142, and I143. Because hamster isomerase has a Tyr at position 138, the final result was a DNA sequence encoding the HA epitope from amino acids 135 to 143 (YPYDVPDYA). The internally HA-tagged isomerase cDNA construct was then digested with NotI andHindIII, and the 1173-bp digestion product was gel purified and ligated into NotI and HindIII sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. The subsequent clone was termed pIsoHA, and the sequence of the insert was confirmed by sequencing. A deletion of the putative C-terminal PTS1 targeting signal was made by PCR-amplifying the template, pIsoHA, with primer T7 and primer IsoΔPTS1 (5′-TCA AAGCTT ATT CTT TAT ATT TTC TCG TG-3′; HindIII site underlined, stop codon in boldface). The resulting 716-bp product was digested with EcoRI andHindIII and ligated into the EcoRI andHindIII sites of pcDNA3.1. This vector was termed pIsoHAΔPTS1. Transformed fibroblast cell lines from a patient with Zellweger syndrome, FAIR-T, belonging to complementation group 2, and a patient with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, BRO-T, belonging to complementation group 11 were kindly provided by Dr. Suresh Subramani (University of California, San Diego, CA). A control skin fibroblast cell line was obtained from Dr. Peter Pentchev (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and used during passage 16. All cells were grown in monolayer at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell lines from the patients with Zellweger syndrome and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). CHO K1 cells were maintained in the same medium, except this medium was supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum instead of 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using Perfect Transfection Pfx-7 lipid (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells on coverslips were washed in PBS and fixed in 3.0% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (also used for subsequent washes). A mixture of rabbit anti-catalase and mouse anti-HA (both at a final dilution of 1:50) was applied to the coverslips and incubated for 60 min. The cells were washed, and a mixture of secondary reagents consisting of fluorescein conjugate of goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) antibody (at a final dilution of 1:100) and Texas Red-X conjugate of goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) antibody (at a final dilution of 1:200) was applied to the coverslips for 60 min. The cells were washed extensively, and the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides for observation with a Nikon fluorescence microscope. Based on the cDNA sequence of human IPP isomerase (14Xuan J. Kowalski J. Chambers A.F. Denhardt D.T. Genomics. 1994; 20: 128-131Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), two oligonucleotide primers were constructed and used in RT-PCR on rat liver poly(A)+ RNA to amplify 667 bp of the isomerase coding region. This PCR product was used as a probe to screen an oligo dT-primed cDNA library made from liver of a rat fed a C+M diet. These two drugs up-regulate mRNA levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and a number of other enzymes involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (22Clarke C.F. Tanaka R.D. Svenson K. Wamsley M. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 7: 3138-3146Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A total of approximately 500,000 colonies were screened, and four individual clones were isolated and sequenced. All four clones had 5′ UTRs of different lengths, varying from 72 to 385 nucleotides (data not shown). To identify the size of the longest 5′ UTR of rat isomerase, 5′ RACE was performed on poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the liver of a C+M-fed rat. The PCR product indicated that the longest 5′ UTR was 385 nucleotides, giving a size of 1182 bp for the complete cDNA of rat IPP isomerase (data not shown). The full-length cDNA for hamster IPP isomerase was isolated utilizing 5′ and 3′ RACE. The experiments were performed using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from CHO K1 cells. Eight individual, overlapping, partial clones were isolated and sequenced (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequences from both the rat and hamster cDNAs were compared with the deduced amino acid sequence of human IPP isomerase (Fig. 1). The following results were obtained: (i) hamster isomerase has an 89.4% identity and a 95.6% similarity to human isomerase; (ii) rat isomerase has an 86.3% identity and a 92.5% similarity to human isomerase; and (iii) hamster and rat isomerases have a 91.6% identity, and a 96.0% similarity to one another. To investigate if IPP isomerase mRNA levels are modulated by compounds known to affect cholesterol biosynthesis, we performed Northern blot analysis on poly(A)+ RNA isolated from rats fed a control diet, a diet containing cholesterol, or a diet containing C+M. When probed with a radiolabeled isomerase fragment, a 2.4-kb transcript was observed in each lane (Fig.2 A). Relative to the control diet, the 2.4-kb transcript was significantly increased in the C+M diet, whereas in the cholesterol diet, the 2.4-kb transcript was significantly decreased. Additionally, a second message of 1.1 kb was detected in the lanes from the C+M diet. The presence of this message and the observation that the 2.4-kb message is significantly larger than the size predicted by sequencing of 5′ RACE products and library clones led us to further analyze both of these transcripts. We determined by RT-PCR on gel purified rat liver poly(A)+ RNA corresponding to 2.4 and 1.1 kb that both messages contained the coding region of rat IPP isomerase (data not shown). A possible explanation for the size discrepancy is alternative splicing of the 3′ UTR to give a 3′ UTR size of approximately 1 kb. Including a poly(A)+ tail of 200 bp, this would yield a final transcript size of approximately 2.4 kb. We have performed 3′ RACE on isolated rat liver poly(A)+ RNA to investigate possible alternative splicing of the 3′ UTR; however, the results were inconclusive (data not shown). To investigate if IPP isomerase protein levels are modulated by compounds known to affect cholesterol biosynthesis, we performed immunoblot analysis on liver homogenates isolated from rats fed a control diet, a diet containing cholesterol, or a diet containing C+M. When blotted using antiserum against the thioredoxin-isomerase fusion protein, there was a marked increase of a 29-kDa band in the lanes corresponding to the C+M diet as compared with the normal diet and a diet containing cholesterol (Fig. 3). The isomerase band of 29 kDa is in excellent agreement with the molecular weight of human IPP isomerase when overexpressed in E. coli, as judged by SDS-PAGE (15Hahn F.M. Xuan J.W. Chambers A.F. Poulter C.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There was no visible difference in the 29-kDa band between the lanes corresponding to the cholesterol and normal diets. These data, and the data obtained from Northern analysis, indicate that a diet containing C+M up-regulates rat liver IPP isomerase both at the mRNA and protein levels. To identify whether IPP isomerase is present as a single copy gene, a Southern blot was performed using rat genomic DNA. The blot was probed with a 180-bp rat isomerase fragment, chosen due to its high degree of conservation among several species (15Hahn F.M. Xuan J.W. Chambers A.F. Poulter C.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The Southern blot revealed a single band hybridizing in each lane (Fig.4), providing evidence that rat IPP isomerase is present as a single copy gene. These data further suggest that the two transcripts (2.4 and 1.1 kb) visualized by Northern analysis (Fig.2 A) originated from a single gene. Because all of the mammalian isomerases have putative PTS1 and PTS2 motifs, we first constructed a eukaryotic expression vector containing the full coding sequence of hamster IPP isomerase with an internal HA epitope tag. This vector was termed pIsoHA (Fig.5 A). An internal HA tag was chosen instead of C- or N-terminal HA tags so as not to disrupt the potential PTS1 or PTS2 function. To determine in which subcellular compartment IPP isomerase is localized, we transfected pIsoHA into control human fibroblast cells. The cells were then simultaneously immunolabeled with anti-catalase antibody (Fig. 6 A) and anti-HA antibody (Fig.6 B). The immunofluorescence pattern for catalase was superimposable over the pattern obtained with the HA antibody. Similar results were obtained in CHO cells when labeled with anti-catalase antibody (Fig. 6 C) and anti-HA antibody (Fig.6 D). These results show that hamster IPP isomerase is colocalized with catalase to peroxisomes. To determine which of the PTS targeting signals are used by the hamster isomerase, we used two distinct cell lines derived from patients with peroxisomal disorders. One cell line, BRO-T, shown to be deficient in the peroxisomal import of only PTS2 proteins, was from a patient diagnosed with rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, belonging to complementation group 11 (23Slawecki M.L. Dodt G. Steinber S. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Gould S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1817-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other cell line, FAIR-T, shown to be deficient in the peroxisomal import of both PTS1 and PTS2 proteins, was from a patient diagnosed with Zellweger syndrome, belonging to complementation group 2 (23Slawecki M.L. Dodt G. Steinber S. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Gould S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1817-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To first determine if the putative PTS2 is responsible for peroxisomal import, the construct pIsoHA was transfected into the PTS2-deficient cell line BRO-T. The cells were double-labeled with anti-catalase antibody (Fig. 6 E) and anti-HA antibody (Fig. 6 F). The data again demonstrated a superimposable punctate pattern when labeled with anti-catalase and anti-HA antibodies. These results suggest that IPP isomerase does not use the putative PTS2 for peroxisomal targeting. To determine if the isomerase is targeted via the PTS1 machinery, we transfected pIsoHA into the FAIR-T cell line and again immunolabeled the cells with anti-catalase antibody (Fig. 6 G) and anti-HA antibody (Fig. 6 H). As expected, catalase labeling showed a cytosolic fluorescence pattern, i.e. catalase is imported by the PTS1 mechanism (24Purdue P.E. Castro S.M. Protopopov V. Lazaro P.B. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 775-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), hence it is localized to the cytosol in cells deficient in this import. A similar cytosolic pattern was revealed over the same field of cells labeled with anti-HA antibody. These results suggest that the transfected isomerase uses PTS1. To provide direct evidence that the putative PTS1 of isomerase is necessary for peroxisomal targeting, a second expression vector was constructed, pIsoHAΔPTS1, in which the HRM tripeptide was deleted (Fig. 5 B). This deletion construct was transfected into the PTS2-deficient cell line BRO-T. The immunofluorescence pattern was consistent with peroxisomal labeling when anti-catalase antibody was used (Fig. 7 A), whereas a cytosolic labeling pattern was obtained when the anti-HA antibody was used (Fig.7 B). Thus, these data show that the HRM tripeptide is necessary for the targeting of IPP isomerase to peroxisomes. The HRM tripeptide is present at the C terminus of both the rat and hamster homologues of IPP isomerase. However, the human homologue at its C terminus has a YRM tripeptide (Fig. 1). The PTS1 consensus sequence of (S/A/C)(K/H/R)(L/M) was derived from extensive mutational analysis, where peroxisomal proteins from other organisms or nonperoxisomal proteins were used as reporters. Because of the formulation of this consensus sequence, more peroxisomal proteins have been identified, the PTS1-like tripeptide of which does not fit this exact sequence. However, it has been demonstrated recently that many amino acid substitutions can be made at the first position of a homologous protein without compromising the PTS1 function (17Elgersma Y. Vos A. van den Berg M. van Roermund C.W.T. van der Sluijs P. Distel B. Tabak H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26375-26382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, this strongly suggests that human isomerase is also targeted to peroxisomes by a PTS1, because the RM dipeptide meets the consensus sequence criteria. The peroxisomal enzymes required for conversion of mevalonate to FPP (i.e. mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, and FPP synthase) have now been all cloned and sequenced. Four of the five enzymes, mevalonate kinase (25Tanaka R.D. Lee L.Y. Schafer B.L. Kratunis V.J. Mohler W.A. Robinson G.W. Mosley S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2872-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), phosphomevalonate kinase (26Chambliss L.L. Slaughter C.A. Schreiner R. Hoffman G.F. Gibson K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17330-17334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (27Toth J.M. Huwyler L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7895-7898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and isomerase (14Xuan J. Kowalski J. Chambers A.F. Denhardt D.T. Genomics. 1994; 20: 128-131Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), contain a conserved putative PTS1 or PTS2, supporting the concept of a targeted transport into peroxisomes. This is the first study to unequivocally demonstrate that IPP isomerase, one of the five enzymes involved in the conversion of mevalonate to FPP, uses a PTS1 for peroxisomal targeting. FPP synthase does not contain a currently identifiable PTS1 or PTS2, yet it is selectively localized to peroxisomes. It seems likely that targeting to peroxisomes must include alternative mechanisms, not yet defined."
https://openalex.org/W2019685500,"The growth hormone receptor (GHR) cDNA was cloned from the liver of Rhesus macaque using polymerase chain reaction. As deduced from the nucleotide sequence, the mature GHR is a protein of 620 amino acids which presents 94.1% identity with the human receptor. The monkey GHR (mkGHR) expressed in 293 cells presented the expected specificity for a primate GHR and was able to transduce a transcriptional effect of GH. Human GH was able to activate tyrosine phosphorylation of both the tyrosine kinase JAK2 and the receptor in 293 cells co-transfected with mkGHR and JAK2 cDNAs. The GH binding protein (GHBP), the soluble short form of the GHR, was also present in monkey serum. Expression of the GHR cDNA in eucaryotic cells indicated that the GHBP can be produced by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane receptor. Northern blot analysis of GHR gene expression in different tissues allowed us to identify three different transcripts of 5.0 and 2.8 kilobase pairs and a smaller one of 1.7 kilobase pairs which could encode a GHBP. Rapid amplification of cDNA extremities (3′-RACE-polymerase chain reaction) was used to identify a cDNA encoding a protein in which the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the receptor are substituted by a short sequence of 9 amino acids. This transcript was present in various tissues and could encode a GHBP as well, suggesting for the first time that two different mechanisms can coexist for the generation of the GHBP: proteolytic cleavage of the membrane receptor and a specific mRNA produced by alternative splicing.

Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). In many species including man, only the liver GH receptor (GHR) has been well characterized (9Hocquette J.F. Postel-Vinay M.C. Kayser C. de Hemptinne B. Amar-Costesec A. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Hocquette J.F. Postel-Vinay M.C. Djiane J. Tar A. Kelly P.A. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The rabbit liver GHR was purified to homogeneity and sequenced, and the cDNA encoding the GHR was cloned first in rabbit and subsequently in man (11Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachianes G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C. Henzel W.J. Barnard R. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. Nature. 1987; 330: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar), which permitted study of the expression of the GHR gene in many tissues (12Delehaye-Zervas M.C. Mertani H. Martini J.F.

Postel-Vinay M.C. Morel G. Endocrine. 1995; 3: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Some molecular events following the binding of GH to its receptor have been identified: dimerization of the GHR is induced (14Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) and initiates the association with a tyrosine kinase of the JAK family, followed by a cascade of protein phosphorylations, including the JAK2 kinase and the receptor itself (15Argetsinger L.S. Campbell G.S. Wang X. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Carter-Su C. Cell. 1993; 74: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Moreover, transcriptional activation by the GHR has been determined by co-transfecting the promoter of a GH-responsive gene coupled to a reporter gene along with the cDNA of rat GHR (16Goujon L. Allevato G. Simonin G. Paquereau L. Le Cam A. Clark J. Nielsen J.H. Djiane J. Postel-Vinay M.C. Edery M. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or of rabbit GHR (17Sotiropoulos A. Perrot-Applanat M. Dinerstein H. Pallier A. Postel-Vinay M.C. Finidori J. Kelly P.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These transcriptional effects of GH involved signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) factors, and it has been shown that GH is able to activate the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 (18Moller C. Hansson A. Enberg B. Lobie P.E. Norstedt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23403-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, several alternative signaling pathways have been identified to be induced by the activated GHR, such as stimulation and tyrosine phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (19Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (20Billestrup N. Bouchelouche P. Allevato G. Ilondo M. Nielsen J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition to the membrane GHR, a soluble GH-binding protein (GHBP) has been identified in serum (21Baumann G. Stolar M.W. Amburn K. Barsano C.P. DeVries B.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 62: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 22Herington A.C. Ymer S. Stevenson J. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In rabbit, the amino acid sequences of the GHBP and of the extracellular domain of the membrane receptor are identical (11Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachianes G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C. Henzel W.J. Barnard R. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. Nature. 1987; 330: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 23Spencer S.A. Hammonds R.G. Henzel W.J. Rodriguez H. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7862-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two separate mechanisms have been proposed for the genesis of the GHBP. In mice and rats, two distinct mRNAs of 4.5 and 1.5 kb encode the full-length membrane receptor and the GHBP, respectively. In these species, the transmembrane region of the receptor has been replaced by a short hydrophilic tail (24Smith W.C. Kuniyoshi J. Talamantes F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 984-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 25Baumbach W.R. Horner D.I. Logan J.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). In man, rabbit and several other species, the major mRNA transcript is ∼4.5 kb as detected by Northern blot analysis; it has been proposed that GHBP results from proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound receptor. The release of GHBP was first demonstrated in the medium of IM-9 cells (26Trivedi B. Daughaday W.H. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 2201-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). More recently, direct evidence of the production of GHBP in cultured medium of cells transfected with the cDNA encoding the rabbit GHR has been presented (27Sotiropoulos A. Goujon L. Simonin G. Kelly P.A. Postel-Vinay M.C. Finidori J. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1863-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In monkeys, GH has been purified (28Li C.H. Papkoff H. Science. 1956; 124: 1293-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), its primary structure identified (29Li C. Chung D. Lahm H.W. Stein S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 245: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and its cDNA was cloned many years later (30Golos T.G. Durning M. Fisher J.M. Fowler P.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 33: 1744-1752Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This hormone is 96% identical to human GH. The tissue distribution of the monkey GHR has been studied by ligand binding (31Posner B.I. Kelly P.A. Shiu P.C. Friesen H.G. Endocrinology. 1974; 95: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) but was not well characterized because of low expression of the GHR in most tissues. The only effect of GH studied in monkeys is the preservation of bone mass in hypogonadal females treated with recombinant human GH (32Mann D.R. Rudman C.G. Akinbami M.A. Gould K.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 74: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the human GHR cDNA was cloned several years ago, experiments using the full-length human cDNA have been impeded by difficulties such as growth of bacterial clones and altered specificity of expressed receptors, as reported by several authors (3Colosi P. Wong K. Leong S.R. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12617-12623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachianes G. Hammonds R.G. Collins C. Henzel W.J. Barnard R. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. Nature. 1987; 330: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). We sought to clone another primate (Rhesus macaque) GHR cDNA for the development of tools to study signal transduction pathways. Evidence that two different mechanisms could coexist to generate the GHBP has been obtained in monkey. Recombinant human GH was kindly provided by Serono-Ares Laboratories (Geneva, Switzerland), recombinant bovine GH by Dr. W. Baumbach (American Cyanamid Co., Princeton, NJ) (Ref. 9450-1-7), and recombinant human PRL by Dr. J. Martial (University of Liege, Belgium). All tissues were obtained immediately after death from two adult male Rhesus macaque (8 and 9 years old) killed according to procedures recommended by the Panel on Euthanasia of the French Health Ministry. Tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until used. Serum samples were of young and old adult male Rhesus macaque from the breeding of the Centre d'Etude et de Recherche en Médecine Aérospatiale, Brétigny-sur-Orge, France. The preparation of RNA was carried out according to the acidic phenol/chloroform method (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63176) Google Scholar). The recovery of total RNA was measured by spectrophotometer (Beckman DU-64, Beckman) at 260 nm. Some aliquots were loaded on a 1% agarose gel to compare the relative intensity of 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNAs. Similar intensities were observed in all samples (data not shown). Polyadenylated RNAs were purified on oligo(deoxythymidine)-cellulose affinity columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Total liver RNA (5 μg) was transcribed into cDNA in a 20-μl reaction using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT) primed with 1 μg of oligo(deoxythymidine)12–18 primer (Boehringer Mannheim) and conditions described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Half of each product was used as template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primer pairs hGR5-hGR23 or hGR15-hGR3 specific for each part of the GH receptor (see Table I and Fig. 1 A). The reaction was carried out in PCR buffer (50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3), 200 μm deoxy-NTPs, 25 pmol of forward and reverse primers, and 1 units of Taqpolymerase (Perkin-Elmer) in a total volume of 50 μl. The experiment proceeded for 20 cycles, where a cycle consisted of 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 53 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C. After a 10-min final extension at 72 °C, the products were isolated on a 2% agarose gel, electroeluted, and subcloned into the pCRII vector (TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen). After insert orientation, each part of the receptor cDNA subcloned was digested by KpnI (restriction enzyme site contained in the pCRII vector)-XbaI (restriction enzyme site contained in the insert), and introduced at the same time into the pECE expression vector previously digested withKpnI and treated with alkaline phosphatase. This construction contained the cDNA encoding the full-length monkey receptor. This cDNA was excised by BstXI digestion and subcloned in the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). It consisted of 2131 bp with 104 bp in 5′-untranslated and 113 bp in 3′-untranslated regions, and an open reading frame of 1914 bp.Table IOligonucleotides used for PCR cloning, RT/PCR, and Southern and Northern hybridizationNameSequencePositionUsagenthGR35′-TAGAATCCATACCCCATCCTG-3′2021 –2041CloninghGR55′-TCTGCTTGCATATATGAGTGA-3""127 –107CloninghGR155′-TTTCCTTCCTTGAGGAGATCTGG-3′931 –954CloninghGR235′-CCCTATATTGACAACATCAGTTCC-3′624 –647CloningmGR05′-CTGCTGTTGACCTTGGCACTG-3′16 –36CloningmGR315′-GGACAGATGCGGTTCATCATGG-3′203 –224CloningmGR465′-TACCTCCGTCTGGATACCTTA-3′354 –374SouthernmGR565′-GTCCAGTTGAGGGCAATGG-3′455 –473CloningmGR735′-TCCTATATTGTCAACATCAGTTCC-3′624 –647SouthernmGR1045′-CCTTCCTTGAGGAGATCTGG-3′931 –950SouthernTMD5′-GCCCAAATATTCCAAAGATAATAATTAAGAGCC-3′800 –832NorthernmGbp5′-GCTATTTTAATCTTTTATTTCTTTTACC-3′784 –811SouthernAP5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACTTTTTTTTTTT-3′CloningY15′-CCGCGTCTCCTTTGAGCTGTTTGCAG-3′54 –79SouthernY25′-ACCCAAAGGGAACTGCAGCGAGAGC-3′598 –622SouthernName, sequence, position (nucleotides), and the use of each oligonucleotide are indicated.

Double stranded DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Conlson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52655) Google Scholar) using modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and by the PCR technique (Perkin-Elmer). Sequence comparisons were performed using the Bisance Program (35Dessen P. Fondrat C. Valencien C. Mugnier C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1990; 6: 355-356PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies Inc.) on 6-well plates. Cells were transfected at 70% confluence (7 × 105 cells/well) by a modification of the DEAE-dextran-chloroquine procedure (36McCutchan J.H. Pegano J.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1968; 41: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar) with 1 μg of pcDNA3/mkGHR per well: the precipitate was made with 10 mg/ml DEAE-dextran, 100 μm chloroquine, and 10 ng of DNA/μl. After 4 h, the precipitate was removed, cells were subjected to 10% dimethyl sulfoxide shock for 2 min, and fresh medium was added. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced by GC 3 medium for 12 h and hGH binding was studied. Human kidney fibroblast 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nut F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Several hours before transfection cells were plated in two-thirds Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nut F12, one-third Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 4.5 g/liter glucose medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For binding studies, the cells (5 × 105 cells/well of 6 wells plate) were transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA3/mkGHR or pcDNA3/mkGHBP cDNAs using the calcium phosphate technique. After 24 h of expression, cells were deprived of serum for an overnight period and hGH binding was studied. The conditioned medium was recovered for GHBP measurement. For GH dependent induction of reporter construct, 293 cells were plated in 6-well plates before being transiently cotransfected as described before with 0.5 μg of pCH110 (β-galactosidase expression vector from Pharmacia), 100 ng of plasmid pcDNA3/mkGHR, and 75 ng of the fusion gene construct containing the luciferase-coding sequence linked to either the sequence −175/59 of Spi 2.1 promoter (plasmid Spi-luc) or to 2.3 kb of the β-casein promoter (plasmid β-Cas-luc). One day after transfection, cells were incubated with serum-free medium containing 50 nm rhGH and 250 nm dexamethasone (Sigma) or 250 nm dexamethasone alone for 48 h. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer (Pharmacia), and whole cell extracts were used for determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. To correct for differences in transfection efficiencies between plates within an experiment, luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. For purification of GHR complexes and Western blot analysis, 293 cells (5 × 106, in 100-mm dishes) were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid pcDNA3/mkGHR and 2 μg of cDNA encoding JAK2 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Ihle), according to the same protocol. Transfected 293 cell extracts in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.6% Triton X-100) were incubated with the designated antibody and with protein A-Sepharose (50%, v/v) under nondenaturating conditions, overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times in cold lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophesis. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter and immunodetected with either an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, 0.1 mg/ml) or an anti-JAK2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, dilution 1/4000) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were incubated with an anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody coupled to peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature before being washed four times for 30 min in washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and revealed by chemiluminescence (ECL kit from Amersham). Membranes were stripped overnight at 4 °C in an acid solution (0.1m glycine, pH 3, 0.1 m NaCl) and reprobed. [125I]hGH was prepared using chloramine-T, as described previously (9Hocquette J.F. Postel-Vinay M.C. Kayser C. de Hemptinne B. Amar-Costesec A. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), with a specific activity ranging between 80 and 180 μCi/μg. Liver and kidney were cut into pieces and homogenized with an equal volume of 250 mm sucrose, buffered at pH 7.4 with 3 mm imidazole-HCl, using a Teflon-glass homogenizer. Microsomal membrane fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation (9Hocquette J.F. Postel-Vinay M.C. Kayser C. de Hemptinne B. Amar-Costesec A. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2167-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Incubation of [125I]hGH (1 × 10−10m) with liver membrane fraction in a volume of 450 μl (25 mm Tris-HCl and 20 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4, with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) was performed for 18 h at 4 °C. Incubations were stopped by addition of 3 ml of chilled binding buffer. Bound and free hormones were separated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 30 min. Transfected COS-7 or 293 cells (1 × 106 cells/well of 6-well plates) were incubated with [125I]hGH in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Incubations were carried out at room temperature for 4 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; then cells were lysed by 1 ml of 1 n NaOH. Pellets and cell suspensions were counted using a LKB Pharmacia γ-spectrometer. Binding of [125I]hGH to serum GHBP was measured by gel filtration and high performance liquid chromatography, as described previously (37Tar A. Hocquette J.F. Souberbielle J.C. Clot J.P. Brauner R. Postel-Vinay M.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 1202-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For cells in culture, media were concentrated (20 times) using Centriprep 30 column (Amicon). Scatchard analyses were performed using the Ligand program (38Munson P.J. Rodbard O. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). Ten to twenty μg of polyadenylated RNA were electrophoresed through a 1.1% agarose, 2.2m formaldehyde gel and transferred to Hybond-N+membrane (Amersham) by capillary blotting under high ionic strength in 20 × standard saline citrate (1 × SSC, 0.15 mNaCl, and 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.2). Membranes were baked at 80 °C for 2 h and prehybridized for 4 h at 65 °C in 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5m NaHPO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS (39Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 81: 1991-1995Crossref Scopus (7267) Google Scholar), and 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membranes were then hybridized overnight at 65 °C in the prehybridization buffer in the presence of 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled cDNA probe, previously denatured for 5 min at 100 °C. Washes were performed at 65 °C once in 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and then twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 30 min each. Autoradiographic exposure was about 1 week at −80 °C with intensifying screen. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with the given probe (E, I, and TMD, Fig. 1 B) and the human cyclophilin cDNA probe was used as control (40Haendler B. Hofer-Warbinek R. Hofer E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Probe E corresponds to the first 813 bp of the receptor extracellular part and was obtained by digestion of the 5′ PCR fragment with EcoRI and XbaI. Probe I correspond to a 670-bp part of the receptor intracellular domain and was obtained by digestion of the 3′ PCR fragment with EcoRI andHindIII. The TMD probe is a 33-mer oligonucleotide specific for the transmembrane region of the receptor (Table I); the GHBP probe is a 28-mer reverse oligonucleotide corresponding to the specific sequence of the mGbp (Table I) and was 5′-end-labeled. cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were carried out as described before. Four different sets of primers were used mGR46-mGR104, mGR0-mGR56, mGR0-mGR104, and mGR46-mGbp (Table I, Fig. 1 B) and the annealing temperature used for 25 PCR cycles was 54 °C. The amplification products were separated on 2.2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and transferred onto a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham). Southern hybridization with a 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe mGR73 was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To control the efficiency of the reverse transcription reaction, a control amplification of the ubiquitous protein cyclophilin (40Haendler B. Hofer-Warbinek R. Hofer E. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) was performed on the same sample using specific human primers Y1 and Y2 (TableI). Total kidney and heart RNA (4 μg) were transcribed into cDNA using the 3′-RACE system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends and conditions described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5 μl of each product were used as template for PCR amplification as described previously using primers mGR0 and AP (Table I). The experiment proceeded for 30 cycles, where a cycle consisted of 35 s at 94 °C, 1.30 min at 63 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. The products were diluted 1/50 and submitted to a second amplification for 25 cycles, with an annealing temperature of 68 °C using primers mGR31 and AP (Table I). After a 15-min final extension at 72 °C, the products were isolated on a 2% agarose gel, electroeluted, and subcloned into the pMOS Blue cloning vector (Amersham). The insert was sequenced and oriented; to construct an expression vector containing cDNA encoding the mkGHBP, this specific sequence was introduced in pcDNA3/mkGHR plasmid as a substitute for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The specific binding of [125I]hGH to microsomal membrane fractions from two male Rhesus macaque livers was similar: 3.5 and 4.9% of total radioactivity/300 μg of membrane protein. A microsomal fraction prepared from kidney of the same two animals had a very low level of binding, less than 1%. Binding affinities to liver GHR were 1.95 ± 0.08 × 109m−1 and 3.31 ± 0.16 × 109m−1, with a comparable binding capacity of 26.37 ± 0.58 and 23.27 ± 0.51 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The cDNA of the monkey GHR was cloned in two parts, hGR5-hGR23 called 5′ and hGR15-hGR3 called 3′, with the common hGR15-hGR23 region (Fig. 1). These two parts had a size of 1087 and 1389 bp, respectively. The hGR5 and hGR3 primers were chosen with regard to the sequence alignment in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions that are conserved over species (TableI). To confirm the sequence obtained by PCR amplification of two long fragments, amplification of given portions of the sequence was performed using specific pairs of primers mGR0-mGR56 and mGR46-mGR104 (Table I). The sequences obtained were identical using the two methods. The overall amino acid identity is 94.1% with the human GH receptor, and all the characteristic domains of GHR family are conserved. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the cDNA of the full-length receptor inserted in the pcDNA3 eucaryotic expression vector. Specific binding of [125I]hGH to whole cells demonstrated that the cloned receptor was expressed by the transfected cells. The association constant calculated by Scatchard analysis from the competition experiment shown in Fig. 2 was 5.75 ± 0.16 × 109m−1 and the binding capacity was of 22,000 sites/cell. Scatchard analysis from competition binding was also performed with 293 cells transiently transfected with the mkGHR cDNA; the affinity constant was the same, 4.35 ± 0.11 × 109m−1. As expected for a primate GH receptor, recombinant bovine GH failed to compete with [125I]hGH; a small effect could be observed only at high concentrations of unlabeled hormone demonstrating the specificity of this primate receptor for primate GH (Fig. 2). Somatogenic specificity was also attested by absence of competition by recombinant human PRL with [125I]hGH binding (Fig.2). We have used the constructs β-casein/luciferase (β-Cas-luc) or Spi 2.1/luciferase (Spi-luc) to test the ability of GH to activate β-casein or serine protease inhibitor gene transcription. Human 293 fibroblast cells were transiently cotransfected with a plasmid containing the mkGHR (in pcDNA3 vector) and reporter gene constructs (β-Cas-luc or Spi-luc). These cotransfections resulted in a clearly inducible luciferase activity by GH. The maximal effect could be achieved with 50 nm hGH, as described previously (16Goujon L. Allevato G. Simonin G.

All three mammalian adenylyl cyclases were expressed in insect (Sf9 or Hi-5) cells by baculovirus infection. Membranes containing the different adenylyl cyclases were stimulated by varying concentrations of mutant (Q227L) activated Gαs expressed in reticulocyte lysates. Gαsstimulation of AC1 involved a single site and had an apparentK act of 0.9 nm. Gαsstimulation of AC2 was best explained by a non-interactive two site model with a “high affinity” site at 0.9 nm and a “low affinity” site at 15 nm. Occupancy of the high affinity site appears to be sufficient for Gβγ stimulation of AC2. Gαs stimulation of AC6 was also best explained by a two-site model with a high affinity site at 0.6–0.8 nm and a low affinity site at 8–22 nm; however, in contrast to AC2, only a model that assumed interactions between the two sites best fit the AC6 data. With 100 μm forskolin, Gαs stimulation of all three adenylyl cyclases showed very similar profiles. Gαs stimulation in the presence of forskolin involved a single site with apparentK act of 0.1–0.4 nm. These observations indicate a conserved mechanism by which forskolin regulates Gαs coupling to the different adenylyl cyclases. However, there are fundamental differences in the mechanism of Gαs stimulation of the different adenylyl cyclases with AC2 and AC6 having multiple interconvertible sites. These mechanistic differences may provide an explanation for the varied responses by different cells and tissues to hormones that elevate cAMP levels.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3829-3832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they all share the common capability to be stimulated by Gαs. Due to its expected nature, regulation by Gαs has received somewhat less attention than other modes of regulation. Little is known about the regions of adenylyl cyclases involved in Gαs interactions. Early studies with the purified olfactory adenylyl cyclases showed that Gαscould be covalently linked to adenylyl cyclase (8Pfeuffer E. Mollner S. Lancet D. Pfeuffer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18803-18807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a prelude to the mapping of adenylyl cyclase regions involved in interactions with Gαs, we have studied regulation of recombinant AC6, AC2, and AC1 by mutant (Q227L) activated Gαs. Much to our surprise, we find Gαs regulation of the three different adenylyl cyclase appears to be mechanistically different. Stimulation of AC1 is the simplest and appears to involve a single site of interaction. Stimulation of AC2 and AC6 appears to be best explained by multiple sites of interaction. This complex regulation is observable only in the absence of forskolin. In the presence of forskolin, stimulation by Gαs of all three adenylyl cyclases tested appears to involve a single high affinity site.RESULTSThe wild type and mutant activated Gαs expressed in reticulocytes was tested for its ability to stimulate S49 cyc− membranes. Wild-type Gαs did not stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in the presence of GTP. However, extensive stimulation was seen with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog Gpp(NH)p (data not shown). However, with αs*, extensive stimulation was observed with or without added GTP (Fig.1). In contrast, control lysate did not stimulate the cyc− adenylyl cyclase. These results indicated that we had synthesized an activated Gαs, which we used in further studies. When we studied different adenylyl cyclase isoforms expressed in Sf9 cells, we were cognizant of the activity of the endogenous adenylyl cyclases of Sf9 cell membranes. In the case of AC1 and AC2, the endogenous activities represented 3–5% of the total activity under all conditions and hence were not subtracted. In the case of AC6, however, the endogenous activity was between 20–30%. Hence for all AC6 experiments, the difference between control (Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus containing thyroid peroxidase) and AC6-containing membranes for all concentration points was taken as AC6 activity.Figure 3Effect of varying concentrations of αs* on AC2 activity in the absence (A) and presence (B) of 100 μm forskolin. 5 μg of Sf9 cell membranes containing AC2 was assayed in the presence of indicated concentrations of αs*.

Stimulation by Gαs* showed a simple one-site Michaelis-Menten mechanism, and a standard Hofstee transformation yielded a straight line (Fig.2 A, inset). Addition of 100 μmforskolin decreased the apparent K act of Gαs* 6-fold to 0.16 nm; however, the nature of the curve was unaltered (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Effect of varying concentrations of αs* on AC1 activity in the absence (A) and presence (B) of 100 μm forskolin. 5 μg of Hi-5 cell membranes containing AC1 was assayed in the presence of indicated concentrations of αs*.

In the absence of forskolin, stimulation by Gαs* did not saturate even at 35 nm (Fig. 3 A). Upon Hofstee transformation, a curvilinear profile was observed (Fig. 3 A,inset). The data best fit a Michaelis-Menten noninteracting two-site model. The apparent K act for the two sites were 0.9 and 15 nm. To determine if this heterogeneity of interactions arose from multiple forms of AC2 due to differential post-translational modification, we analyzed the AC2-containing membranes by immunoblotting with the ACcommantiserum. A single labeled band of approximately 120 kDa was observed. This profile indicates that the expressed AC2 is not a mixture of differentially modified proteins. We next determined the profile of the Gαs response in the presence of forskolin. With 100 μm forskolin, Gαs* stimulation of AC2 yielded a simple profile (Fig. 3 B); the Hofstee transformation was linear, with a single apparentK act of 0.39 nm measured (Fig.3 B, inset). In Fig. 3 B, the activity due to forskolin alone (313 pmol/min/mg) had been subtracted prior to data analysis and fitting. We next tried to define the conditions of Gαs interaction with AC2 that was optimal for Gβγ stimulation. Without Gαs, no significant stimulation of AC2 by Gβγ was observable (data not shown). At 2.0 nm, Gαs stimulation by Gβγ was seven-fold. In contrast, at 20 nm Gαs, Gβγ stimulated only three-fold over Gαs (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that occupancy of the high affinity site may be sufficient for Gβγ stimulation.We next studied Gαs stimulation of AC6. Gαsstimulation of AC6 was biphasic (Fig. 4 A). Hofstee transformation yielded a curvilinear profile (Fig.4 A, inset II). The Gαsconcentration-response data for AC6 best fit to a two-site model. However, the two-site fitting for AC6 was different from that used for AC2. At low concentration of Gαs, the data showed a single-site interaction profile (Fig. 4 A, inset I) The second site was observable only at concentrations of Gαs above a certain threshold value. For the experiment shown in Fig. 4 A, the threshold value was 3 nm. AC6 activities above 3 nm Gαs are the summation of interactions at both sites. Hence a modified two-site model was used where, for activities above 4 nmαs*, the activity due to the second site is the difference between the observed activity and the maximal activity due to occupancy of the first site. This method of fitting is suggestive of interaction between the sites and may imply that the high affinity site needs to be fully occupied to permit occupancy of the low affinity site. Given the very pronounced biphasic profile, we analyzed the AC6-containing membranes from multiple forms of AC6. However, as shown in the immunoblot in Fig. 4 A, a single band was seen with the ACcomm antibody. The observed band was at 135 kDa as expected for AC6. We then compared the effect of varying concentrations of Gαs on AC6 activity in the presence and absence of forskolin in the same experiment. In the absence of forskolin (Fig.4 B), the profile was very similar to that in Fig.4 A. In the presence of forskolin, stimulation of AC6 by Gαs was simple (Fig. 4 C). Hofstee transformation yielded a straight line (Fig. 4 C,inset), indicating that the data could be fit to a one-site model. Gαs activated AC6 with an apparentK act of 0.2 nm in the presence of forskolin. Furthermore, even in the presence of saturating Gαs, forskolin potentiated AC6 activity by about 30%. To ascertain if the unusual profile of Gαs stimulation seen with AC6 was possibly due to aggregation in the insect cell membranes, we solubilized the AC6-containing membranes with dodecyl maltoside and then assayed the solubilized AC6 in the presence of varying concentrations of Gαs. The solubilized enzyme had lower activity, and the Gαs response was right shifted. However the biphasic nature of the curve was not affected by solubilization (Fig. 4 D). These observations indicate that the biphasic nature of the AC6 response is not due to nonspecific aggregation.DISCUSSIONStimulation through Gαs is the major mechanism by which mammalian adenylyl cyclases are activated and cellular cAMP levels elevated. Given the ubiquitous nature of this effect, one might expect the existence of a conserved mechanism for Gαsactivation of the different mammalian cyclases. The data shown here indicate otherwise. Gαs stimulates AC1 in a monotonic fashion and is the simplest of the three isoforms studied here. Forskolin increases the affinity of Gαs for AC1 without altering the profile of the activity curve. It is noteworthy that the apparent k act for Gαs is similar to the K i for Gβγ (13Tang W-J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus for all practical purposes Gs-coupled receptors would be unable to activate AC1, as has been recently demonstrated by Storm and co-workers (14Nielsen M.D. Chan G.C.K. Poser S.W. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33308-33316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Stimulation of AC2 and AC6 by Gαs is more complex. In the absence of forskolin, Gαs stimulation of AC2 and AC6 is best explained by a two-site model. However, forskolin not only increases the affinity of Gαs but also renders stimulation monotonic, indicating that both the low and high affinity sites can be converted to a higher single affinity site in the presence of forskolin. The single Gαs site in the presence of forskolin indicates that the two sites displayed by AC2 and AC6 are not due to two populations of enzymes when expressed in Sf9 cells.For AC2, occupancy of the “high affinity” Gαs site appears to be sufficient for Gβγ stimulation, since maximal-fold stimulation by Gβγ is observed at 2 nmGαs. This may indicate that some of the determinants for Gαs binding are in the cytoplasmic tail. Interaction of Gαs with these determinants could open up one of the regions involved in Gβγ binding. Such a model would provide a molecular explanation for why Gβγ only stimulates AC2 activated by Gαs.Though Gαs stimulation of both AC2 and AC6 best fit a two site model, our kinetic analysis indicates that there may be crucial mechanistic differences in Gαs stimulation of the two adenylyl cyclases. The AC2 data can be fit to Michaelis-Menten type of equations, suggesting two noninteracting sites. In contrast, the model used to fit the AC6 data required an iterative two-site fitting procedure where the estimated V max of the high affinity site had to be subtracted from the observed activity at higher Gαs concentrations to fit the second site so as to obtain an overall best fit. Such a fitting protocol may indicate interactions between the two sites such that the high affinity site needs to be occupied to obtain occupancy of the low affinity site.The kinetic descriptions of Gαs interactions with the various adenylyl cyclases provided here should not be construed as an indication that each molecule of AC2 or AC6 contains two Gαs binding sites. This is one possible explanation. In such a case, AC1 would either have only one Gαs site or two sites with very similar affinities. Studies by Neer and co-workers on the hydrodynamic properties of the Gαs-adenylyl cyclase from bovine caudate which yield molecular weights for Gαs-adenylyl cyclase complex in the presence of forskolin of 197–225 kDa (15Bender J.L. Wolf L.G. Neer E.J. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1984; 17: 101-109Google Scholar) may support the stoichiometery of 2 Gαs/adenylyl cyclase. This possibility needs to be explored further in detail for the different adenylyl cyclases. There also exist data that do not support 2 Gαs sites/adenylyl cyclase model. Cross-linking of Gαs to the olfactory adenylyl cyclases suggest a 1:1 stoichiometery (8Pfeuffer E. Mollner S. Lancet D. Pfeuffer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18803-18807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If each adenylyl cyclase molecule contains one Gαs site, our data may suggest that adenylyl cyclases have a propensity to dimerize in the membrane environment. If different adenylyl cyclases have differing capabilities to form homodimers, then our data would suggest that AC1 had a very low capability to form homodimers while AC2 and AC6 are more likely to dimerize. Future studies analyzing cross-linking Gαs to adenylyl cyclase as well as accurate molecular size determinations of the Gαs-adenylyl cyclase complex within the membrane are required to determine the stoichiometery of Gαs-adenylyl cyclase interactions. Irrespective of the details that emerge from these studies, it has become abundantly clear that each adenylyl cyclase can respond differently to Gαsand that such differential responses could be crucial factors in determining why different tissues and organs show specialized capability to regulate cAMP elevation.

With 100 μm forskolin, Gαs* stimulation of AC2 yielded a simple profile (Fig. 3 B); the Hofstee transformation was linear, with a single apparentK act of 0.39 nm measured (Fig.3 B, inset). In Fig. 3 B, the activity due to forskolin alone (313 pmol/min/mg) had been subtracted prior to data analysis and fitting. We next tried to define the conditions of Gαs interaction with AC2 that was optimal for Gβγ stimulation. Without Gαs, no significant stimulation of AC2 by Gβγ was observable (data not shown). At 2.0 nm, Gαs stimulation by Gβγ was seven-fold. In contrast, at 20 nm Gαs, Gβγ stimulated only three-fold over Gαs (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that occupancy of the high affinity site may be sufficient for Gβγ stimulation.We next studied Gαs stimulation of AC6. Gαsstimulation of AC6 was biphasic (Fig. 4 A). Hofstee transformation yielded a curvilinear profile (Fig.4 A, inset II). The Gαsconcentration-response data for AC6 best fit to a two-site model. However, the two-site fitting for AC6 was different from that used for AC2. At low concentration of Gαs, the data showed a single-site interaction profile (Fig. 4 A, inset I) The second site was observable only at concentrations of Gαs above a certain threshold value. For the experiment shown in Fig. 4 A, the threshold value was 3 nm. AC6 activities above 3 nm Gαs are the summation of interactions at both sites. Hence a modified two-site model was used where, for activities above 4 nmαs*, the activity due to the second site is the difference between the observed activity and the maximal activity due to occupancy of the first site. This method of fitting is suggestive of interaction between the sites and may imply that the high affinity site needs to be fully occupied to permit occupancy of the low affinity site. Given the very pronounced biphasic profile, we analyzed the AC6-containing membranes from multiple forms of AC6. However, as shown in the immunoblot in Fig. 4 A, a single band was seen with the ACcomm antibody. The observed band was at 135 kDa as expected for AC6. We then compared the effect of varying concentrations of Gαs on AC6 activity in the presence and absence of forskolin in the same experiment. In the absence of forskolin (Fig.4 B), the profile was very similar to that in Fig.4 A. In the presence of forskolin, stimulation of AC6 by Gαs was simple (Fig. 4 C). Hofstee transformation yielded a straight line (Fig. 4 C,inset), indicating that the data could be fit to a one-site model. Gαs activated AC6 with an apparentK act of 0.2 nm in the presence of forskolin. Furthermore, even in the presence of saturating Gαs, forskolin potentiated AC6 activity by about 30%. To ascertain if the unusual profile of Gαs stimulation seen with AC6 was possibly due to aggregation in the insect cell membranes, we solubilized the AC6-containing membranes with dodecyl maltoside and then assayed the solubilized AC6 in the presence of varying concentrations of Gαs. The solubilized enzyme had lower activity, and the Gαs response was right shifted. However the biphasic nature of the curve was not affected by solubilization (Fig. 4 D). These observations indicate that the biphasic nature of the AC6 response is not due to nonspecific aggregation. The wild type and mutant activated Gαs expressed in reticulocytes was tested for its ability to stimulate S49 cyc− membranes. Wild-type Gαs did not stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in the presence of GTP. However, extensive stimulation was seen with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog Gpp(NH)p (data not shown). However, with αs*, extensive stimulation was observed with or without added GTP (Fig.1). In contrast, control lysate did not stimulate the cyc− adenylyl cyclase. These results indicated that we had synthesized an activated Gαs, which we used in further studies. When we studied different adenylyl cyclase isoforms expressed in Sf9 cells, we were cognizant of the activity of the endogenous adenylyl cyclases of Sf9 cell membranes. In the case of AC1 and AC2, the endogenous activities represented 3–5% of the total activity under all conditions and hence were not subtracted. In the case of AC6, however, the endogenous activity was between 20–30%. Hence for all AC6 experiments, the difference between control (Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus containing thyroid peroxidase) and AC6-containing membranes for all concentration points was taken as AC6 activity. The effect of varying concentrations of Gαs* in the presence and absence of forskolin on AC1 expressed in Sf9 cells is shown in Fig. 2. In the absence of forskolin, Gαs* stimulated AC1 with an apparentK act of 0.9 nm. Stimulation by Gαs* showed a simple one-site Michaelis-Menten mechanism, and a standard Hofstee transformation yielded a straight line (Fig.2 A, inset). Addition of 100 μmforskolin decreased the apparent K act of Gαs* 6-fold to 0.16 nm; however, the nature of the curve was unaltered (Fig. 2 B). We studied the effect of varying concentrations of Gαs* in the presence and absence of forskolin on AC2. In the absence of forskolin, stimulation by Gαs* did not saturate even at 35 nm (Fig. 3 A). Upon Hofstee transformation, a curvilinear profile was observed (Fig. 3 A,inset). The data best fit a Michaelis-Menten noninteracting two-site model. The apparent K act for the two sites were 0.9 and 15 nm. To determine if this heterogeneity of interactions arose from multiple forms of AC2 due to differential post-translational modification, we analyzed the AC2-containing membranes by immunoblotting with the ACcommantiserum. A single labeled band of approximately 120 kDa was observed. This profile indicates that the expressed AC2 is not a mixture of differentially modified proteins. We next determined the profile of the Gαs response in the presence of forskolin. With 100 μm forskolin, Gαs* stimulation of AC2 yielded a simple profile (Fig. 3 B); the Hofstee transformation was linear, with a single apparentK act of 0.39 nm measured (Fig.3 B, inset). In Fig. 3 B, the activity due to forskolin alone (313 pmol/min/mg) had been subtracted prior to data analysis and fitting. We next tried to define the conditions of Gαs interaction with AC2 that was optimal for Gβγ stimulation. Without Gαs, no significant stimulation of AC2 by Gβγ was observable (data not shown). At 2.0 nm, Gαs stimulation by Gβγ was seven-fold. In contrast, at 20 nm Gαs, Gβγ stimulated only three-fold over Gαs (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that occupancy of the high affinity site may be sufficient for Gβγ stimulation. We next studied Gαs stimulation of AC6. Gαsstimulation of AC6 was biphasic (Fig. 4 A). Hofstee transformation yielded a curvilinear profile (Fig.4 A, inset II). The Gαsconcentration-response data for AC6 best fit to a two-site model. However, the two-site fitting for AC6 was different from that used for AC2.

These observations indicate that the biphasic nature of the AC6 response is not due to nonspecific aggregation. DISCUSSIONStimulation through Gαs is the major mechanism by which mammalian adenylyl cyclases are activated and cellular cAMP levels elevated. Given the ubiquitous nature of this effect, one might expect the existence of a conserved mechanism for Gαsactivation of the different mammalian cyclases. The data shown here indicate otherwise. Gαs stimulates AC1 in a monotonic fashion and is the simplest of the three isoforms studied here. Forskolin increases the affinity of Gαs for AC1 without altering the profile of the activity curve. It is noteworthy that the apparent k act for Gαs is similar to the K i for Gβγ (13Tang W-J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus for all practical purposes Gs-coupled receptors would be unable to activate AC1, as has been recently demonstrated by Storm and co-workers (14Nielsen M.D. Chan G.C.K. Poser S.W. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33308-33316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Stimulation of AC2 and AC6 by Gαs is more complex. In the absence of forskolin, Gαs stimulation of AC2 and AC6 is best explained by a two-site model. However, forskolin not only increases the affinity of Gαs but also renders stimulation monotonic, indicating that both the low and high affinity sites can be converted to a higher single affinity site in the presence of forskolin. The single Gαs site in the presence of forskolin indicates that the two sites displayed by AC2 and AC6 are not due to two populations of enzymes when expressed in Sf9 cells.For AC2, occupancy of the “high affinity” Gαs site appears to be sufficient for Gβγ stimulation, since maximal-fold stimulation by Gβγ is observed at 2 nmGαs. This may indicate that some of the determinants for Gαs binding are in the cytoplasmic tail. Interaction of Gαs with these determinants could open up one of the regions involved in Gβγ binding. Such a model would provide a molecular explanation for why Gβγ only stimulates AC2 activated by Gαs.Though Gαs stimulation of both AC2 and AC6 best fit a two site model, our kinetic analysis indicates that there may be crucial mechanistic differences in Gαs stimulation of the two adenylyl cyclases. The AC2 data can be fit to Michaelis-Menten type of equations, suggesting two noninteracting sites. In contrast, the model used to fit the AC6 data required an iterative two-site fitting procedure where the estimated V max of the high affinity site had to be subtracted from the observed activity at higher Gαs concentrations to fit the second site so as to obtain an overall best fit. Such a fitting protocol may indicate interactions between the two sites such that the high affinity site needs to be occupied to obtain occupancy of the low affinity site.The kinetic descriptions of Gαs interactions with the various adenylyl cyclases provided here should not be construed as an indication that each molecule of AC2 or AC6 contains two Gαs binding sites. This is one possible explanation. In such a case, AC1 would either have only one Gαs site or two sites with very similar affinities. Studies by Neer and co-workers on the hydrodynamic properties of the Gαs-adenylyl cyclase from bovine caudate which yield molecular weights for Gαs-adenylyl cyclase complex in the presence of forskolin of 197–225 kDa (15Bender J.L. Wolf L.G. Neer E.J. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1984; 17: 101-109Google Scholar) may support the stoichiometery of 2 Gαs/adenylyl cyclase. This possibility needs to be explored further in detail for the different adenylyl cyclases. There also exist data that do not support 2 Gαs sites/adenylyl cyclase model. Cross-linking of Gαs to the olfactory adenylyl cyclases suggest a 1:1 stoichiometery (8Pfeuffer E. Mollner S. Lancet D. Pfeuffer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18803-18807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If each adenylyl cyclase molecule contains one Gαs site, our data may suggest that adenylyl cyclases have a propensity to dimerize in the membrane environment. If different adenylyl cyclases have differing capabilities to form homodimers, then our data would suggest that AC1 had a very low capability to form homodimers while AC2 and AC6 are more likely to dimerize. Future studies analyzing cross-linking Gαs to adenylyl cyclase as well as accurate molecular size determinations of the Gαs-adenylyl cyclase complex within the membrane are required to determine the stoichiometery of Gαs-adenylyl cyclase interactions. Irrespective of the details that emerge from these studies, it has become abundantly clear that each adenylyl cyclase can respond differently to Gαsand that such differential responses could be crucial factors in determining why different tissues and organs show specialized capability to regulate cAMP elevation.

https://openalex.org/W2045693857,"O-Linked fucose is an unusual form of glycosylation recently shown to modify the hydroxyls of serine or threonine residues at a strict consensus site within epidermal growth factor-like domains of several serum proteins. Here we demonstrate that Chinese hamster ovary cells modify numerous proteins withO-linked fucose and that the fucose is elongated on specific proteins. We have identified at least two forms ofO-linked fucose elongation in Chinese hamster ovary cells: a disaccharide (Glcβ1,3Fuc) and a larger oligosaccharide of indeterminate structure. Interestingly, it appears that the level of monosaccharide accumulates in the cells over time whereas the disaccharide does not. Analysis of the O-linked fucose-containing saccharides on individual proteins revealed that some proteins are modified with the monosaccharide only, whereas others are modified with monosaccharide and disaccharide, or monosaccharide and oligosaccharide. These results suggest that elongation of theO-linked fucose monosaccharide is a protein-specific phenomena. The presence of elongated O-linked fucose moieties suggests that a novel glycosylation pathway exists in mammalian cells with O-linked fucose as the core.

These results suggest that elongation of theO-linked fucose monosaccharide is a protein-specific phenomena. The presence of elongated O-linked fucose moieties suggests that a novel glycosylation pathway exists in mammalian cells with O-linked fucose as the core. In the past few years, a number of proteins have been shown to be modified with the monosaccharide l-fucose on the hydroxyls of serine or threonine residues (O-linked fucose) (1Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Urokinase-type plasminogen activator was the first protein identified with this form of glycosylation (2Kentzer E.J. Buko A.M. Menon G. Sarin V.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) followed quickly by tissue-type plasminogen activator (3Harris R.J. Leonard C.K. Guzzetta A.W. Spellman M.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2311-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), factor VII (4Bjoern S. Foster D.C. Thim L. Wiberg F.C. Christensen M. Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17520-17525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through comparison of the sites of glycosylation from these five proteins, a consensus sequence (CXXGG(S/T)C, where S/T is the modified residue) for the addition of O-linked fucose was proposed (7Harris R.J. Van Halbeek H. Glushka J. Basa L.J. Ling V.T. Smith K.J. Spellman M.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6539-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in all cases this motif occurs within an epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor-like; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HPAEC, high pH anion-exchange chromatography; PNGase F, peptideN-glycosidase F; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MS, monosaccharide; DS, disaccharide; OS, oligosaccharide. domain. Although these five proteins are all serum proteins involved in clot formation or dissolution, data base searches have revealed that many other types of proteins also contain this consensus sequence (1Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,7Harris R.J. Van Halbeek H. Glushka J. Basa L.J. Ling V.T. Smith K.J. Spellman M.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6539-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although l-fucose can be found internally linked in polysaccharides from plants and algae, in mammalian systems it is normally thought of as a terminal modification. Nonetheless, over 20 years ago the amino acid fucoside Glcβ1,3Fucα1-O-Ser/Thr was isolated from human urine, demonstrating that fucose residues can be found internally linked in mammalian systems (8Hallgren P. Lundblad A. Svensson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5312-5314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Klinger M.M. Laine R.A. Steiner S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7932-7935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently it was shown that the O-linked fucose moiety on factor IX is elongated into a tetrasaccharide with the structure NeuAcα2,6Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Fucα1-O-Ser (7Harris R.J. Van Halbeek H. Glushka J. Basa L.J. Ling V.T. Smith K.J. Spellman M.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6539-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To date, factor IX is the only protein reported to be modified with this tetrasaccharide structure and the only mammalian protein identified with an elongated fucose of any kind. To study O-linked fucose in mammalian cells, we have used a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, Lec1, which is deficient in the enzyme, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (10Stanley P. Caillibot V. Siminovitch L. Cell. 1975; 6: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 11Stanley P. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These cells are unable to synthesize complex or hybrid-typeN-linked glycans. Since the addition of fucose toN-linked glycans was believed to occur only on complex or hybrid-type chains, we predicted fucose would be incorporated only intoO-linked structures in these cells. Surprisingly, we found that small oligomannose N-glycans (Man4-Man5) were labeled with fucose on the core GlcNAc in these cells suggesting that the core α1,6-fucosyltransferase does have some affinity for these structures (12Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the incorporation of fucose intoN-glycans was greatly reduced and allowed for a better observation of O-linked fucose structures. Stults and Cummings (13Stults N.L. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have utilized this same cell type for studyingO-linked fucose, demonstrating that several proteins are modified with O-linked fucose monosaccharide in these cells. We report here that CHO cells not only modify several endogenous proteins with O-linked fucose but that theO-linked fucose becomes elongated on a subset of the proteins. The major form of elongation is a simple disaccharide consisting of a β-linked glucose at the 3-position of theO-linked fucose (Glcβ1,3Fuc), identical with the structure found previously on amino acid fucosides (8Hallgren P. Lundblad A. Svensson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5312-5314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Klinger M.M. Laine R.A. Steiner S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7932-7935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A larger oligosaccharide also appears to exist, although in smaller and variable amounts. Over 15 proteins from CHO cells appear to be modified withO-linked fucose saccharides, and the elongation ofO-linked fucose appears to be a protein-specific event. The presence of these elongated forms of O-linked fucose suggests the presence of a novel glycosylation pathway in mammalian cells with several potential end points all containingO-linked fucose as the core sugar. Lec1 cells were developed by Dr. Pamela Stanley (11Stanley P. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 14Stanley P. Siminovitch L.

Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For long term labeling, cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of medium containing 50 μCi/ml [6-3H]fucose. For pulse-chase studies, cells were radiolabeled for 1 h in the presence of 100–300 μCi/ml [6-3H]fucose. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl), and resuspended in media containing 10 mm non-radioactive fucose. The radiolabeled cells were then incubated for various chase times before washing and lysing. Radiolabeled cells were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with cold Tris-buffered saline. Cells were lysed by addition of lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixtures I and II (17Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

The unincorporated radiolabel was separated from the protein fraction on a Sephadex G50–150 column (1 × 30 cm) developed in 50 mmammonium formate containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. N-Linked oligosaccharides were removed from the [6-3H]fucose-labeled proteins prior to analysis of theO-linked sugars by digestion with PNGase F as described (12Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The O-linked sugars were released from proteins by alkali-induced β-elimination as described (12Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The releasedO-linked sugar alcohols were size fractionated on a Superdex peptide column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using partially hydrolyzed dextran as size standards (18Haltiwanger R.S. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). High pH anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) was performed on a Dionex DX300 HPLC system equipped with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD-2 cell). Samples were chromatographed on a CarboPac MA-1 column (Dionex Corp.) at 0.4 ml/min using the following gradient: 0–11 min, 0.1 m NaOH; 11–21 min, 0.1–0.7 m NaOH; 21–40 min, 0.7 m NaOH. Radioactive samples were mixed with standards (1 nmol each of fucitol, fucose, and glucose or the disaccharide standards Glcβ1,2fucitol, Glcβ1,3fucitol, and Glcβ1,4fucitol) prior to injection. Fractions (0.2–0.5 min) were collected and monitored for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Standards were followed by pulsed amperometric detection. The saccharides were hydrolyzed in 2m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 2 h. The hydrolyzed samples were then dried in a Speed Vac evaporator (Savant) and resuspended in water prior to analysis by HPAEC. β-Glucosidase digestions were performed by incubating samples in β-glucosidase digestion buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm zinc sulfate, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with β-glucosidase (25 units/ml) overnight at 37 °C. Mock digestions lacking enzyme were performed as a control. To stop the digestion, the sample was heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Digestions with β-galactosidase and β-hexosaminidase were performed as described (12Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Digested samples were diluted into water and analyzed by HPAEC as described above. [6-3H]Fucose-labeled proteins (100 μg/lane), either treated with PNGase F or mock treated, were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), stained with Coomassie Blue, and fluorographed. Additional samples (6 × 100 μg) of PNGase F-treated [6-3H]fucose-labeled proteins were separated on the same gel. After electrophoresis, the lanes containing these samples were cut into 2-mm horizontal slices, and the protein was extracted from the gel slices by incubation overnight in 1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol at room temperature. The eluted proteins were concentrated by acetone precipitation (8 volumes, −20 °C, overnight) and analyzed for O-linked saccharides as described above. Previously, we have shown that the majority (68%) of the [3H]fucose incorporated into proteins of Lec1 cells could be released by digestion with PNGase F (12Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis showed these glycans to be core-fucosylated oligomannose-typeN-linked glycans of the Man4-Man5size (12Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The majority of the PNGase F-resistant [3H]fucose could be released by alkaline-induced β-elimination, implying an O-linkage to the protein (12Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Analysis of the material released by β-elimination on a calibrated Superdex sizing column revealed three radiolabeled species (Fig. 1 A, peaks MS, DS, andOS). MS represents a monosaccharide as it migrates at a position slightly larger than 1 glucose unit. DS migrates at approximately 2 glucose units, representing a disaccharide. OS is a oligosaccharide migrating at a position larger than 10 glucose units. The amount and migration position of the oligosaccharide species varied with the labeling conditions (Fig. 1 B) and the preparation. To determine which of the three species was linked to protein through an O-linked fucose, each peak was analyzed for the presence of fucitol after acid hydrolysis. The sodium borohydride in the β-elimination solution converts the reducing end sugar to the alditol form (e.g. fucose to fucitol) after being released from the protein. Therefore, fucose, which had been directly linked to protein (as in O-linked fucose), would be converted to fucitol. All other forms of fucose (terminal modifications) should remain unreduced (fucose). Acid hydrolysis was performed to break the di- and oligosaccharide species into monomers, and HPAEC was used to separate fucose from fucitol. The monosaccharide comigrated with the fucitol standard before and after acid hydrolysis, suggesting that this species is derived from O-linked fucose (Fig.2 A). When the disaccharide was analyzed prior to acid hydrolysis, it migrated at a unique position relative to fucitol, fucose, and glucose (Fig. 2 B). Acid hydrolysis of the disaccharide converted all of the radioactivity to fucitol, indicating that the disaccharide contains O-linked fucose (Fig. 2 C). Unhydrolyzed oligosaccharide was not recovered from the HPAEC analysis, suggesting that it might be negatively charged. This observation was supported by the analysis of oligosaccharide material on QAE-Sephadex. The majority of the oligosaccharide material bound to QAE-Sephadex and eluted with 70–140 mm NaCl (data not shown). Acid hydrolysis of the oligosaccharide converted the majority of the radiolabel to fucitol, again indicating that the oligosaccharide material containsO-linked fucose (Fig. 2 D). A small amount of unreduced fucose is also recovered from the oligosaccharide fraction. This may be due to a modification of the O-linked fucose oligosaccharide with another fucose, or there may be some contaminants with terminal fucose residues present in this fraction. Further work is required to determine the structure(s) of the O-linked fucose-containing saccharides in the oligosaccharide peak. Thus, all three peaks from the Superdex column represent O-linked fucose-containing saccharides: the monosaccharide, a disaccharide, and an oligosaccharide.Figure 2MS, DS, and OS all containO-linked fucose. The components of the three peaks from the sizing column (MS, DS, and OS) were analyzed by HPAEC before and after acid hydrolysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The migration positions of standard sugars are shown (1, fucitol; 2, fucose; 3, glucose).A, MS peak from Fig. 1 A; B, DS peak from Fig. 1 A prior to acid hydrolysis; C, DS peak from Fig. 1 A after acid hydrolysis; D, OS peak from Fig. 1 A after acid hydrolysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We initially suspected the disaccharide to be a precursor in the synthesis of the known O-linked fucose tetrasaccharide on factor IX (7Harris R.J. Van Halbeek H. Glushka J. Basa L.J. Ling V.T. Smith K.J. Spellman M.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6539-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). If this were the case, then the disaccharide would consist of anO-linked fucose elongated with a β-linkedN-acetylglucosamine. Upon digestion with jack bean β-hexosaminidase, we observed no shift in migration of the disaccharide (data not shown); we also did not observe a shift after digestion with β-galactosidase. Surprisingly, when we subjected the disaccharide to digestion with β-glucosidase, we observed a shift to fucitol (data not shown) indicating that the disaccharide is fucitol modified with a β-linked glucose. In an effort to determine the exact structural identity of theO-linked fucose-containing disaccharide, standards for the three possible configurations where glucose is β-linked to fucose were synthesized. The three disaccharide standards were each reduced with alkaline borohydride, yielding Glcβ1,2fucitol, Glcβ1,3fucitol, and Glcβ1,4fucitol. These alditol standards were analyzed by HPAEC as described under “Experimental Procedures” and shown to migrate at unique positions (Fig. 3). Analysis of the disaccharide from Lec1 cells showed that it migrates exclusively with the Glcβ1,3fucitol standard, demonstrating that the glucose is linked to the third position of the fucose. Although Stults and Cummings (13Stults N.L. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) also utilized Lec1 cells to examine O-linked fucose, they did not observe the disaccharide or oligosaccharide species. We believe that the difference in our findings results mainly from a difference in labeling conditions. Our initial studies were done on cells labeled for 3–5 h with fairly high concentrations of [6-3H]fucose (100–300 μCi/ml). Stults and Cummings (13Stults N.L. Cummings R.D. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) labeled Lec1 cells under equilibrium conditions (24 h, 10 μCi/ml). We examined incorporation of [3H]fucose into the disaccharide under both conditions. Interestingly, we observed a marked decrease in the amount of labeled disaccharide relative to monosaccharide in the long term labeling (compare Fig. 1 B with Fig. 1 A). This suggests that the monosaccharide accumulates during the longer labeling whereas the disaccharide does not. To more closely examine this phenomenon, we labeled cells for 1 h with [3H]fucose and then chased them with cold fucose for 0–5 h. Analysis of theO-linked fucose saccharides clearly shows that the ratio of disaccharide to monosaccharide decreases during the chase, consistent with the idea that the monosaccharide accumulates whereas the disaccharide does not (Fig. 4). Although the oligosaccharide does not change significantly in amount between long and short term labelings, it does appear to change in size (compare Fig. 1, A and B). We are currently investigating this phenomenon. We next sought to begin identifying proteins in Lec1 cells that contain these O-linked fucose modifications. Radiolabeled proteins from Lec1 cells were treated with or without PNGase F and separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5 A). The labeled bands that remained after PNGase F treatment represent O-linked fucose-containing proteins. Over 15 protein species can be identified that appear to be modified with O-linked fucose saccharides. Identical PNGase F-treated samples were separated on the same gel, the gel was cut into 2-mm strips, the proteins were extracted, and each fraction was analyzed for the presence of MS, DS, and OS by size fractionation. As shown in Fig. 5, B–E, different proteins contain different sugar structures. Some protein bands contained only monosaccharide (Fig. 5 C), whereas others contained both monosaccharide and disaccharide (Fig. 5, D andE), or monosaccharide and oligosaccharide (Fig.5 B). Interestingly, the DS-bearing proteins appeared to be localized mainly to lower molecular weight species. Thus, the elongation of O-linked fucose appears to be a protein-specific phenomenon. In this report we have demonstrated that CHO cells not only modify numerous proteins with O-linked fucose but that theO-linked fucose is elongated on a subset of these proteins. At least two forms of elongation occur in these cells: a disaccharide and an oligosaccharide. The elongation appears to be protein-specific since some proteins bear only monosaccharide, some monosaccharide and disaccharide, and some monosaccharide and oligosaccharide. In addition, the ratio of disaccharide to monosaccharide on proteins in these cells decreases over time. We have identified the disaccharide as Glcβ1,3Fuc based on sensitivity to β-glucosidase digestion and comigration of the reduced, β-eliminated product with a Glcβ1,3fucitol standard on HPAEC. A disaccharide with this structure was originally reported as an amino acid fucoside (Glcβ1,3Fucα1-O-Ser/Thr) isolated from human urine over 20 years ago (8Hallgren P. Lundblad A. Svensson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5312-5314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very little has been reported since then about the occurrence of this disaccharide on intact proteins. One report showed that a disaccharide tentatively identified as glucosylfucitol could be released by alkaline borohydride treatment of proteins from newborn rat kidney cells (20Morton P.A. Steiner S.M. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that CHO cells are capable of modifying O-linked fucose with a β-linked glucose in the 3-position. This is an important finding in that several companies now use CHO cells to produce genetically engineered proteins that are used clinically, some of which are known to be modified with O-linked fucose (e.g. tissue-type plasminogen activator). The observed change in the level of disaccharide relative to monosaccharide over time could have several potential explanations. For instance, it is possible that the change in ratio of disaccharide to monosaccharide could be the result of the removal of the glucose residue by a novel processing β-glucosidase activity. Alternatively, the disaccharide-modified proteins could be preferentially secreted from the cells. Another potential explanation is that the proteins modified with disaccharide turn over more rapidly than the proteins modified with monosaccharide. Finally, the disaccharide could be a precursor to the oligosaccharide. Further work is necessary to test these possibilities and determine an explanation for the disappearance of the disaccharide. The oligosaccharide reported here may be related to the tetrasaccharide found on factor IX, since preliminary results indicate that the oligosaccharide is negatively charged and therefore may contain sialic acid. Alternatively, the oligosaccharide may be a novel structure unrelated to the tetrasaccharide. As mentioned above, the oligosaccharide could result from elongation of the disaccharide, although further work needs to be done to analyze the relationship between these two structures. Work on the structure and composition of this oligosaccharide is under way. The fact that the disaccharide and the oligosaccharide are found on discrete populations of proteins suggests there may be specific signals for the elongation of O-linked fucose on certain proteins. In such a model, an enzyme that adds a sugar to O-linked fucose would need to recognize the fucose as well as some protein determinant that directs the elongation. This paradigm is not without precedent, as both the lysosomal enzyme GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase (21Lang L. Reitman M.L. Tang J. Roberts R.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14663-14671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the glycoprotein hormone GalNAc transferase (22Smith P.L. Baenziger J.U. Science. 1988; 242: 930-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 23Manzella S.M. Hooper L.V. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12117-12120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) are examples of protein-specific glycosyltransferases that recognize specific protein motifs and the sugar to be modified. This finding of protein-specific elongation of O-linked fucose is consistent with the finding of the tetrasaccharide modification on factor IX and only monosaccharide on the other known O-linked fucose modified proteins. To our knowledge, no proteins containing the glucosylfucose disaccharide modification have been identified, although we have identified several potential candidates in CHO cells. The identification of the various O-linked fucose-containing saccharide structures has revealed an entirely new glycosylation pathway (see Fig. 6). The first step in the pathway is the addition of O-linked fucose to a consensus sequence by an O-fucosyltransferase (Fig. 6, see A). This enzyme has recently been identified and was initially characterized (24Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.F. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it appears to require an intact EGF domain containing the consensus site for efficient glycosylation to occur. For some proteins, this is the end of the pathway. For others, the fucose can be elongated on the 3-position by either a Glc or a GlcNAc. These reactions are catalyzed by as yet undescribed enzymes: anO-linked fucose β1,3-glucosyltransferase or anO-linked fucose β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, respectively (Fig.6, see B and C). Other yet to be identified forms of elongation are also possible (indicated by the question marks). For instance, an unidentified, neutral,O-linked fucose-containing structure (“TS” for trisaccharide) was reported by Morton and Steiner (20Morton P.A. Steiner S.M. Biochem. J. 1985; 225: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and may represent an elongated form of the disaccharide or a novel structure. The oligosaccharide we observed here may also result from elongation of Glcβ1,3Fuc, or it may be related to the tetrasaccharide. For the GlcNAcβ1,3Fuc-modified proteins the pathway continues with the addition of galactose and sialic acid (presumably by standard Golgi galactosyl- and sialyltransferases) to form the tetrasaccharide structure represented on factor IX (7Harris R.J. Van Halbeek H. Glushka J. Basa L.J. Ling V.T. Smith K.J. Spellman M.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6539-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The entire pathway most likely occurs in the Golgi apparatus since there are apparently no GDP-fucose transporters in the endoplasmic reticulum (25Hirschberg C.B. Snider M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 63-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The O-linked fucose pathway appears to be widespread in biology. Proteins bearing O-linked fucose have been reported from insects to humans (1Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 7Harris R.J.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although a specific function has not yet been assigned to any of theO-linked fucose saccharides, several intriguing observations have been made in the past few years. First, two interesting studies have shown that O-linked fucose on the EGF domain of urokinase is necessary for a mitogenic/growth factor-like activity of the domain (27Rabbani S.A. Mazar A.P.

Cortez S.L. Baricos W.H. Kleinman H.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Growth factor domains lacking the fucose could bind to urokinase receptors but could not induce mitogenesis. These results suggest that the fucose is necessary for transmission of the mitogenic signal into the cell. Hajjar and Reynolds (29Hajjar K.A. Reynolds C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have suggested that O-linked fucose within the EGF domain of tissue plasminogen activator plays a role in the serum half-life of the protein, although other workers have suggested that this is not the case (30Camani C. Kruithof E.K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26053-26056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Also, the list of proteins that are predicted to be modified contains several cell surface receptors, which are involved in cell signaling and developmental regulation (7Harris R.J. Van Halbeek H. Glushka J. Basa L.J. Ling V.T. Smith K.J. Spellman M.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6539-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some of these proteins have multiple O-linked fucose consensus sites (e.g. Notch-12 sites (31Ellisen L.W. Bird J. West D.C. Soreng A.L. Reynolds T.C. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1991; 66: 649-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar), Delta-6 sites (32Knust E. Dietrich U. Tepass U. Bremer K.A. Weigel D. Vassin H. Campos-Ortega J.A.

Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar)) and are known to interact with each other through their EGF domains (34Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). Modification of these domains with O-linked fucose saccharides may provide a means of modulating these interactions. Ultimately, the functional importance ofO-linked fucose and its variations will become clearer as we learn more about this unusual form of glycosylation.

We also thank Dr. Khushi Matta for the generous provision of disaccharide standards used in this study."

In this paper, we describe mutations at three discrete regions of the soluble adenylyl cyclase, one in the IC1 protein and two in the IIC2 protein, that significantly affect Gsα activation with little change in forskolin activation. Plasmids used to express mutant forms of IC1and IIC2 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using pProExHAH6-IC1 or -IIC2 as the phagemid (9Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis contained 10–12 complementary nucleotides flanking each side of the target codon(s) that was replaced with the appropriate codon. Mutations were confirmed by dideoxy nucleotide sequencing of phagemid DNA. To express wild type and mutant forms of hexohistidine-tagged IC1 and IIC2, the plasmids that encoded wild type or mutant forms of IC1 or IIC2 were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. E. coli cells that harbored the desired plasmid were cultured in T7 medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin at 30 °C (10Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). WhenA 600 reached 0.4, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 μm) was added. After 3–4 h, the induced cells were then collected and lysed; IIC2 proteins were purified using the nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column and fast protein liquid chromatography Q-Sepharose column as described (5Yan S.-Z.

The same protocol was tested by modeling the structure of Giα, which resulted in a model closely agreeing with GTPγS-bound Giα structure (the root mean square deviation of the Cα atoms was found to be 1.17 Å) (14Coleman D.E.

Gsα was docked onto the C1C2 heterodimer using program O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgard M.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar and this paper). We use the sequence comparison to guide the mutagenic mapping of the Gsαbinding site (Fig. 1). The IIC2, but not the IC1, protein has weak Gsα- and forskolin-stimulated activity (∼1000-fold less than mixed IC1 and IIC2 proteins) (18Yan S.-Z. Huang Z.-H. Shaw R.S. Tang W.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12342-12349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, the C2 domain must include amino acid residues that contribute to binding and partial activation by Gsα and forskolin. Some of these residues are expected to be conserved among the C2 domain of mammalian and fly adenylyl cyclases but might not be conserved among the C1 domain of mammalian and fly adenylyl cyclases and the cyclase domains of membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases. Fourteen IIC2 mutants (to either alanine or leucine) at the 13 residues that fit this criterion were constructed, and all of them had relatively normal expression based on immunoblot (Figs. 1 and 2 (mutants IIC 2 C911A, R913A, I919A, and D921Aand 10 other mutants not shown). We then tested for Gsαand forskolin activation using E. coli lysates containing the IIC2 mutant proteins and wild type IC1protein (Table I). Due to the semiquantitative nature of using E. coli lysates, we graded the enzyme activity of the lysates containing IIC2 mutants relative to that containing wild type IIC2 as follows: near normal (+++, >50% of the control), moderately reduced (++, 25–50% of the control), significantly reduced (+, 5–25% of the control), and little or no activation (±, <5% of the control). We expected that mutations at the Gsα binding site in the IIC2 protein would cause a significant reduction in Gsα activation but have little or no effect in forskolin activation. Only two of these IIC2 mutants, R913A and D921A, fit these criteria. 2Five IIC2 mutants (F898L/Y899L, I919A, F994A, Q1040A, R1059A, and K1065A) and four mutants (Y899L, C911A, T943A, and Y1054L) had no (<5% that of the control) or significantly reduced (5–25% that of the control) activations by Gsα and by forskolin, respectively. IIC2F898L and S891A had near normal and moderately reduced activation by Gsα and by forskolin, respectively.

Open table in a new tab To confirm that IIC2 mutants R913A and D921A had reduced Gsα activation and to further characterize these mutants, we purified both IIC2 R913A and D921A to homogeneity and tested for their Gsα- and forskolin-activated activity when mixed with purified IC1protein in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3; Table I). Both IIC2 R913A and D921A had near normal enzyme activity when stimulated by forskolin, whereas they had about a 15-fold reduction in Gsα-stimulated activity (Fig. 3,A and B; Table I). In the presence of 10 μm forskolin, both IIC2 R913A and D921A had relatively normal V max values but had significantly increased EC50 values for Gsαactivation (Fig. 3 C and Table I). While this research was in progress, the three-dimensional structure of the IIC2·forskolin complex was solved, and the structure revealed that Arg-913 and Asp-921 were located on the amphipathic α2 helix (Fig. 1) (15Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To test the effect of mutations at the conserved residues located at the hydrophilic surface of α2, IIC2mutants E910A, L914A, N916A, E917A, and D924A were constructed and tested for their activity in response to Gsα and forskolin activation (Table I; Figs. 2 and 3). Similar to IIC2 mutants R913A and D921A, the lysates containing IIC2 E910A, L914A, N916A, and E917A had significantly reduced or little Gsα activation but only moderate reduction in forskolin activation (Table I). The D924A mutation did not affect Gsα and forskolin activation (data not shown). IIC2 E910A, L914A, N916A, and E917A were purified to homogeneity and tested for their activation by Gsα and forskolin (Figs. 2 and 3; Table I). All four mutants had about a 10-fold reduction in Gsα activation and less than a 2-fold reduction in forskolin activation. Similar to IIC2R913A and D921A, all four mutants had significant increases in EC50 values for Gsα activation. These data indicate that six amino acid residues, Glu-910, Arg-913, Leu-914, Asn-916, Glu-917, and Asp-921, of IIC2 are involved in Gsα activation. In contrast to the sensitivity of other mammalian and fly adenylyl cyclases to both Gsα and forskolin, type IX enzyme is activated by Gsα but not by forskolin (19Premont R.T. Matsuoka I. Mattei M.-G. Pouille Y. Defer N. Hanoune J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13900-13907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the crucial residue(s) for forskolin binding is missing in the C2 domain of type IX enzyme. Sequence comparison among the C2 domains reveals that eight amino acid residues are absolutely conserved among type I-VIII and rutabaga adenylyl cyclases but differ in type IX enzyme (Fig. 1). Five of them (Gln-880, Ser-881, Ser-942, Ser-990, and Asn-992) have been mutated to alanine and tested for their activation by Gsα and forskolin. 3All five mutants expressed normally, based on immunoblot. Lysates containing IIC2 Q880A and S881A had near normal and moderately reduced activation by Gsα and by forskolin, respectively. Lysates containing IIC2 S942A had near normal activation by Gsα but moderately reduced activation by forskolin. Purified IIC2 S942A had 5-fold reduction in forskolin stimulation but normal Gsαactivation (S.-Z. Yan, Z. H. Huang, and W.-J. Tang, unpublished data). Fortuitously, another region that affects Gsα activation was revealed. Lysates containing mutant IIC2 N992A had near normal forskolin activation but a significantly reduced Gsα activation. Lysates containing mutant IIC2 S990A had near normal Gsα and forskolin activation; however, a consistent 2-fold higher relative percent of Gsα activation (119 ± 13%) than of forskolin activation (57 ± 10%) was observed. When we tested a lysate containing the IIC2double mutant S990A/N992A, the Gsα-and forskolin-activated activity was near normal, and the percent of Gsα activation (76 ± 9%) was less than that of forskolin activation (139 ± 28%). To further characterize IIC2 S990A, N992A, and S990A/N992A, the three mutant proteins were purified to homogeneity and tested for Gsα and forskolin activation (Figs. 2 and4; Table I). IIC2 S990A was normal in forskolin activation, whereas IIC2 N992A and S990A/N992A had only a slight reduction in forskolin activation (Table I and Fig.4 A). Interestingly, IIC2 S990A had about 3-fold-enhanced Gsα activation, whereas IIC2N992A had 4-fold-reduced Gsα stimulation (Table I and Fig. 4 B). The Gsα activation of double mutant IIC2 S990A/N992A was nearly normal, presumably due to compensation by the two mutations (Table I and Fig. 4 B). When simultaneously stimulated by Gsα and forskolin, IIC2 N992A had a lower V max value but relatively normal EC50 value (Table I and Fig.4 C). In contrast, IIC2 S990A had a decrease in both EC50 and V max values; the decrease in EC50 could explain the apparent higher Gsα activation when assayed only with Gsα(Table I and Fig. 4 C). Double mutant IIC2S990A/N992A had a near normal V max value and a slightly increased EC50 value. The three-dimensional structure of IIC2·forskolin reveals that Ser-990 is the only residue that joins the α3 and β4 regions of IIC2; thus, it might play a pivotal role in controlling the relative orientation between α3 and β4 of IIC2 (Fig. 1). How the change from Ser-990 to Ala alters both EC50 andV max values for Gsα activation remains elusive. To further examine the region containing Ser-990 and Asn-992, we constructed and tested six more alanine-scanning IIC2 point mutants in the Asn-987–Lys-995 region. Two more amino acid residues, His-989 and Phe-991 were shown to be involved in Gsαactivation. 4When a lysate containing mutant IIC2N987A was assayed, significant reduction in both Gsα and forskolin activation was observed. However, purified IIC2N987A exhibited near normal forskolin activation but somewhat reduced Gsα activation. Such a discrepancy is likely due to the lower expression of IIC2 N987A (though not shown by immunoblot in Fig. 2). Lysates containing IIC2 K998A and K995A had near normal Gsα and forskolin activation, and lysate containing IIC2 D993A had moderately reduced Gsα and forskolin activation. Mutant IIC2F994A is described in Footnote 2. Lysates containing IIC2 H989A and F991A had a significantly reduced Gsα activation but had near normal or moderately reduced forskolin stimulation, respectively (Table I). Similar results were observed when the purified mutant proteins were used (Table I and Fig.4). When the mutants were stimulated by Gsα and forskolin simultaneously, IIC2 H989A exhibited a lowerV max value but relatively normal EC50 value. When the same assay was applied to IIC2 F991A, a significant increase in EC50value was observed; due to low enzyme activity, theV max value of this mutant could not be determined. It is worth noting that two IIC2 mutants in this region (at the α3/β4 region, IIC2 S990A and N992A) had reductions in V max values but had little increases in EC50 values (Fig. 4 C); this is in contrast to the IIC2 α2 mutants that all have increased EC50 values. The C1 and C2 domains of mammalian adenylyl cyclase have ∼25–50% identity, and there is a high degree of sequence conservation between dimer interface residues in C1 and C2 based on the interaction of the IIC2 dimer in the (IIC2)2·forskolin2 crystal structure (15Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between C1 and C2 domains might be similar to that of the IIC2dimer in (IIC2)2·forskolin2crystal structure. Since the α2 region of the IIC2protein is close to the interface of the IIC2 dimer, we asked whether Gsα could interact with the amino acid residue(s) located at the C1 domain near the α2 helix of the IIC2 protein in order to facilitate the interaction between the C1 and C2 domains. The contact of the IIC2 dimer in IIC2·forskolin model predicts that the sequences at the proposed N terminus of IC1 are likely candidates (Fig. 6 A). Truncation analysis revealed that the IC1 mutant, Δ271–292, a deletion of amino acid residues 271–292, had normal Gsαor forskolin activation (Table I). We then constructed and tested the Gsα- and forskolin-stimulated activity of four IC1 mutants, F293A, H294A, S305A, and L307A, that have a mutation in the N-terminal region of IC1. Only one IC1 mutant, IC1 F293A, exhibited little Gsα activation but retained a near normal forskolin stimulation when either E. coli lysate containing IC1 F293A or purified IC1 mutant protein (Figs.2 and 5; Table I) were used. 5Based on immunoblot, IC1 F293A, H294A, and S305A had normal expression. IC1 H294A and S305A had significantly reduced and little Gsα- and forskolin-stimulated activity, respectively. IC1 L307A had more than a 10-fold reduction on expression based on immunoblot and also had no detectable enzyme activity even when Gsα and forskolin was used. When stimulated by Gsαand forskolin, a significant increase in the EC50 value of mutant IC1 F293A was also observed (Fig. 3). We also tested the conserved amino acid residues in the putative β4/β5 region, which is adjacent to the putative N terminus of IC1, and found that none of the mutants exhibited a preferen-tial reduction in Gsα activation. 6Eight mutants with mutations at the putative β4/β5 region of IC1, T403A, V406A, V410A, L411A, K415A, W416A, Q417A, and Y418A, were constructed and tested for their activation by Gsα and forskolin. All the mutants expressed normally, based on immunoblot. Six mutants, V406A, V410A, K415A, W416A, Q417A, and Y418A, were near normal in Gsαand forskolin activation. Mutants IC1 L411A and T403A had significantly reduced or no stimulation by Gsα and forskolin, respectively. These data indicate that the conserved Phe-293 at the C1 domain is crucial in Gsα activation. In addition, the data provide support for the idea that the structure of the C2 dimer is valid in examining the structure of the C1C2heterodimer.Figure 5Biochemical analysis of IC1F293A.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mutagenesis based on the sequence comparison of adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases and the molecular structure of IIC2 has revealed that 10 amino acid residues (Glu-910, Arg-913, Leu-914, Asn-916, Glu-917, Asp-921, His-989, Ser-990, Phe-991, and Asn-992) within two regions (α2 and α3/β4) of IIC2 are essential for Gsα activation. Although these two regions of IIC2 proteins are 68 amino acids apart in the primary sequence, they are in close proximity in the structure of the IIC2·forskolin dimer (Fig. 6, Aand B). The Gsα binding site is separate from but close to the proposed G protein βγ binding site (N terminus of α3) of type II adenylyl cyclase, which is consistent with ability of the Gβγ to synergize the Gsα activation of type II enzyme (Fig. 6 A) (20Tang W.-J.

The putative Gsαbinding site forms a negatively charged and hydrophobic groove 10 × 10 × 15 Å, capacious enough to bind an α helix (Fig. 6,B and C). 7The C-terminal part of the α3 helix of a symmetry-related adenylyl cyclase molecule completely fills this groove in the crystal. The Phe-991 side chain of the symmetry-related adenylyl cyclase binds to a prominent hydrophobic patch in the center of the groove floor formed by the Leu-914 side chain and by methylene groups on Arg-913, Glu-917, and Ser-990. This negatively charged groove could attract the positively charged surface formed by the putative adenylyl cyclase binding region of Gsα (α2/β4 (switch 2), α3/β5, and α4/β6) (13Noel J.P. Hamm H.E.

Cell. 1992; 68: 911-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, B and C). It is also worth noting that the sequences at the C1 α2 region are reasonably conserved among the Giα-sensitive adenylyl cyclase (types I, V, and VI) but not other isoforms; thus, it may be the determinant for Giα binding, a site independent of that for Gsα (23Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The complex of C1 and C2 domains are necessary for potent activation by Gsα. Although how the C1 domain interacts with the C2 domain remain elusive, we hypothesize that their interaction is similar to the contact of the IIC2 dimer based on the following observations: the relative high degree homology of C1 and C2 domains, the sequence conservation at the dimer interface of C1 and C2 domains based on the structure of IIC2 dimer, and the success of the C1C2 model to predict the importance of the N terminus of C1 domain for Gsα activation. The C1C2 model was constructed using the homology modeling based on the (IIC2·forskolin)2structure (Fig. 6). The model shows that the putative adenylyl cyclase binding regions of Gsα can dock well to the negatively charged groove that is its presumed site in adenylyl cyclase (Fig.6 B); the validity of this model remains to be tested experimentally. How does Gsα activate adenylyl cyclase? Based on mutational analysis, we hypothesize the following events leading to the activation of adenylyl cyclase by Gsα. The greatest effects on EC50 values for Gsα activation map to the C2 α2 helix, suggesting that in the first step, Gsα binds to adenylyl cyclase with an energetic driving force provided primarily by the α2 helix of the C2region. The sensitivity to mutation at Phe-293 demonstrates a potential role for Gsα in bridging the C1 and C2 domains and promoting their juxtaposition in a catalytically productive manner. The observation that mutation of the α3/β4 of C2 can alter the V maxfor Gsα-stimulated catalysis suggests that this region is an allosteric linker between the Gsα binding site and the active site. Indeed, both α2 and β4 directly participate in forming the ventral cleft-containing active site. The Gsα binding regions occur on portions of the two longest α helices in the cyclase structure. The α2 and α3 helices provide 30- and 37-Å-long lever arms, respectively, such that a modest change in their mutual orientation at the Gsα binding site could be converted scissorswise into a large change in the structure of the active site, leading to catalytic activation. The determination of the molecular structure of C1C2 and GsαC1C2 is in progress, and the solution will yield valuable insight into how Gsαactivates adenylyl cyclase. We thank P.

https://openalex.org/W2051342030,"Hox genes encode transcription factors that are major determinants of embryonic patterning. Recently, we and others have shown that specific recognition of target sites in DNA is partly achieved through cooperative interaction with the extradenticle/pre-B-cell transformation-related gene (EXD/PBX) family of homeodomain-containing proteins. This interaction is mediated by the YPWM motif present N-terminal to the homeodomain in HOX proteins. In the present study, we use YPWM peptides to confirm the importance of this motif for mediating HOX/PBX interactions. We also used a novel monoclonal antibody directed against the YPWM to show that occlusion of this motif abrogates cooperativity with PBX. In addition, we present evidence that residues flanking the YPWM, both N-terminally and C-terminally, stabilize the HOX·PBX cooperative complex. Because these flanking residues are also conserved among paralogs, they are likely to help distinguish the specificity of HOX/PBX interactions. Our data further show that the relative importance of individual residues within and flanking the YPWM is dependent on the identity of position 6 of the cooperative binding site (TGATTNATGG). These results suggest that interactions between PBX and the YPWM motif are modified by a base pair predicted to contact the N-terminal arm of the HOX homeodomain. Hox genes encode transcription factors that are major determinants of embryonic patterning.

These results suggest that interactions between PBX and the YPWM motif are modified by a base pair predicted to contact the N-terminal arm of the HOX homeodomain. The patterning of the animal embryo along the anteroposterior axis is a tightly regulated developmental process in which Hoxgenes play a major role (1McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, theHox genes are represented by a single cluster, Hom-C. There are 39 Hox genes identified to date in mice and humans, grouped into four clusters, A to D (2Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). Hox genes occupying the same relative position in each cluster form a group of paralogous genes that are more closely related to each other than to their neighbors in other paralogous groups (2Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). In addition, paralogs tend to be expressed in similar domains along the anteroposterior axis (1McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). Accordingly, paralogs possess both unique and overlapping functions as shown by gene targeting studies (3St-Jacques B. McMahon A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). There exists a fine correlation between the position of a given Hox gene on the chromosome and its spatio-temporal expression pattern with respect to the anteroposterior axis (2Krumlauf R. Cell. 1994; 78: 191-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 4Duboule D. Dollé P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1497-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 5Graham A. Papalopulu N. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1989; 57: 367-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Accordingly, genes at the 3′-end of the cluster are turned on earlier and have their boundaries of expression set more anteriorly (6Duboule, D. (1994) Development (suppl.) 135–142.Google Scholar). Genes more 5′ in the cluster have a more posterior boundary of expression and are activated later (6Duboule, D. (1994) Development (suppl.) 135–142.Google Scholar). HOX proteins bind DNA through the conserved homeodomain, encoded by the homeobox (7Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Cell. 1994; 78: 211-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). The homeodomain consists of three α-helices and an N-terminal arm that is unstructured in unbound proteins. Site-specific DNA binding is achieved by interaction of the third helix with the major groove and interaction of the N-terminal arm with the minor groove (7Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D. Affolter M. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Cell. 1994; 78: 211-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Hox genes from paralog groups 1–8 also encode a highly conserved motif present N-terminal to the homeodomain (7Gehring W.J. Qian Y.Q. Billeter M. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Schier A.F. Resendez-Perez D.

This motif, variously called the pentapeptide, hexapeptide, or YPWM motif, is connected to the homeodomain through a flexible linker (9Qian Y.Q. Otting G. Furukubo-Tokunaga K. Affolter M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PBX residues contacted by the YPWM motif of HOX proteins are located within and immediately following the homeodomain in PBX (18Chang C.-P. Shen W.-F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Cleary M. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 25Chang C.-P. de Vivo I. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Lu Q. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1632-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although abdominal-B (ABD-B) members (paralogous groups 9–13) do not possess a classical YPWM motif, some form cooperative complexes with PBX through conserved tryptophan residues. Similar to the position of the YPWM motif in HOX proteins, the conserved tryptophan in ABD-B members is present N-terminal to the homeodomain (27Izpisua B.J. Falkenstein H. Dollé P. Renucci A. Duboule D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2279-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 28Chang C.-P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.-F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Inhibition of DNA binding by the Drosophila HOX protein labial (LAB) is a second function attributed to the YPWM motif. This inhibition is relieved by interaction with EXD or PBX (23Chan S. Popperl H. Krumlauf R. Mann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2476-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus far, studies focused on the YPWM motif have demonstrated it to be the key PBX/EXD interacting motif. Recent work has shown that peptides bearing this motif are sufficient to induce PBX monomer binding (22Knoepfler P.S. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5811-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Mutational and biochemical analyses of the HOX/PBX binding site (5′-TGATTNATGG-3′) demonstrate that PBX occupies the 5′ half-site (TGAT) while the HOX partner occupies the 3′ half-site (TNATGG) (26Lu Q. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1632-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,29Chan S. Mann R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Individual HOX proteins, upon heterodimerization with PBX, acquire different specificities for target DNA recognition (28Chang C.-P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.-F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These binding differences are achieved in part through the modulation of the HOX N-terminal arm by PBX (28Chang C.-P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.-F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 29Chan S. Mann R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8635-8643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). One of the residues that mediates DNA binding by the N-terminal arm is the arginine at position 3 of the homeodomain in paralogs 2–8, while the same position is occupied by a conserved lysine in ABD-B class HOX proteins (33Ekker S.C. Jackson D.G. von Kessler D.P. Sun B.I. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory (32Phelan M. Featherstone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8635-8643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have shown that residue 3 is important for the binding of HOX monomers but does not contribute to DNA binding in heterodimers with PBX. Hence, N-terminal arm residues that normally mediate minor groove contacts by HOX monomers are displaced in the cooperative complex (32Phelan M. Featherstone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8635-8643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Residues flanking the YPWM core are well conserved among proteins of the same paralogous group but vary significantly between proteins from different groups (Fig. 1 C), suggesting a role in the specificity of HOX function. The present study demonstrates that YPWM-dependent interactions are stabilized by the residues flanking the core motif. We further show that this modulation of HOX/PBX interactions leads to differential target site recognition. pTrcHisA was generated by subcloning the PstI/HindIII fragment of Hoxd4(34Featherstone M.S. Baron A. Gaunt S.J. Mattei M.-G. Duboule D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4760-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) into the same sites in pTrcHisA. For the alanine scanning mutagenesis of the YPWM and the N- and C-terminal flanking residues, aPstI/XbaI fragment of Hoxd4 (34Featherstone M.S. Baron A. Gaunt S.J. Mattei M.-G. Duboule D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4760-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) was first subcloned into identical sites in M13 mp19 phagemid. Single-stranded (sense) DNA was produced from the M13 phagemid carrying the Hoxd4 insert, and mutagenesis was performed using the Sculptor mutagenesis kit (Amersham Corp.). As a final step toward generation of the mutants, a PstI/EcoRI fragment of M13 phagemid DNA carrying the different alanine scanning mutations were subcloned into the same restriction sites in both the pTrcHisAHoxd4 and pPGK-Hoxd4-vp16 (17Phelan M.L. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3989-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) backgrounds. Construction of the luciferase reporters pML (5 × Hox) and pML (5 × HOX/PBX) are described elsewhere (17Phelan M.L. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell.

HOXD4, HOXD4 (WM-AA) and the alanine scanning mutants were expressed as N-terminal histidine-tagged fusion proteins and purified as described (32Phelan M. Featherstone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8635-8643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The purity and concentration of the purified proteins were estimated as described earlier (32Phelan M. Featherstone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8635-8643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PBX1A and E2A-PBX1A were synthesized in vitro using a TnT in vitro transcription/translation coupled kit (Promega). A synthetic peptide (KLH-CAVVYPWMKKVHVNSVNPNY-CO2H) spanning the YPWM and flanking N- and C-terminal residues coupled to KLH (Peptide Innovations Inc.) was used as an immunogen to generate monoclonal antibodies against the YPWM region using a strategy described previously (36Reed J. Tanaka S. Cuddy M. Cho D. Smith J. Kallen R. Saragovi H. Torigoe T. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To screen for positive clones that would recognize the YPWM of HOXD4, bacterially expressed and purified pTrcHisAHoxd4 (explained above) was used as the source of antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 1The abbreviations used are: ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; mAb, monoclonal antibody. as explained elsewhere (37Catty D. Antibodies: A Practical Approach. I. IRL Press, Oxford1988: 1-203Google Scholar). mAb 10D11 was isotyped using a mouse immunoglobulin isotyping kit from Serotec. It was found to be IgG 1A class and hence was purified to homogeneity on a protein G-Sepharose column (38LeSauteur L. Maliartchouk S. Jeune H. Quirion R. Saragovi H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1308-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged alanine-scanning mutants of the YPWM and the flanking residues of HOXD4 (explained above) served as the source of antigen for the epitope mapping of mAb 10D11 by ELISA. EMSA and dissociation rate experiments were performed as described previously (32Phelan M. Featherstone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8635-8643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of wild type and mutant HOXD4 proteins were used based on estimates from Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. Labeled DNA probe 0–262, TGATTNATGG (32Phelan M. Featherstone M. J.

YPWM and nonspecific peptides were purchased from Peptide Innovations Inc. Prior to use they were resuspended in distilled water. Quantification of the labeled DNA-bound HOX·PBX cooperative complexes at various time points and estimation of the half-lives of the complexes were carried out as described previously (32Phelan M. Featherstone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8635-8643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The figures showing the EMSA data were produced electronically in Freehand 5.0 for Macintosh. Autoradiographs were scanned as reflective grayscale images using a Umax UC 1260 scanner and the Autodensity function. The resulting images were saved as PICT files in Adobe Photoshop 3.0 for Macintosh and then placed into Freehand for labeling. Other than uniform size changes, the images were unmodified. Transient transfection was performed in HEK293 cells as described previously (17Phelan M.L. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3989-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were cultured in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (Sigma). Mouse 10D11 hybridoma was cultured in RPMI containing 5% fetal calf serum. Previously, we have shown that HOXD4 and PBX1A cooperatively bind DNA through a motif present in HOX proteins called the pentapeptide or YPWM motif (17Phelan M.L. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3989-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This YPWM motif is a key region for mediating interactions with PBX, since mutating residues WM to AA is sufficient to prevent the formation of a HOX·PBX cooperative complex (17Phelan M.L. Rambaldi I. Featherstone M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3989-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of a synthetic peptide (YPWM peptide; Fig. 1 A) containing the HOXD4 YPWM core and flanking residues to prevent cooperative complex formation between HOXD4 and PBX1A. Using increasing concentrations of the synthetic YPWM peptide, a 50% reduction of the starting HOXD4·PBX1A complex was observed at 160 μmconcentration (Fig. 2, lane 5). A further increase in the concentration of the synthetic peptide to 320 and 640 μm reduced the amount of the starting complex to 25 and 5%, respectively (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7). A complete loss of the starting complex (Fig. 2, lane 8) resulted when the synthetic peptide reached a concentration of 800 μm. To confirm the specificity of the HOXD4 YPWM-containing peptide to prevent HOX·PBX complexes, we also tested a nonspecific synthetic peptide (Fig. 1 A) in a band shift assay to prevent HOXD4·PBX1A complex formation. At comparable concentrations, there is little reduction in complex formation (Fig. 2,lanes 9–15).Figure 2YPWM peptide prevents HOX·PBX interactions in EMSA. A dose-dependent inhibition of HOXD4·PBX1A cooperative complex formation is caused by the YPWM peptide (see Fig.1 A) (lanes 2–8), while a nonspecific peptide under similar conditions had no profound effect (lanes 9–15). Peptide concentrations are indicated above the respective lanes. Lane 1, which contains no peptide, served as a positive control that was set to 100 for densitometric quantitation of the HOXD4·PBX1A cooperative complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using the YPWM peptide (Fig. 1 A and see “Experimental Procedures”), we produced a B cell hybridoma whose monoclonal antibody, designated 10D11, specifically recognizes the YPWM motif of HOXD4 protein. To finely map the epitope recognized by the mAb 10D11, bacterially purified histidine-tagged alanine scanning mutants spanning the YPWM motif and flanking residues of HOXD4 (Fig.1 B) were used in ELISA. The key residues in the YPWM motif of HOXD4 recognized by 10D11 mAb are the tyrosine and tryptophan, with complete loss of recognition if either one of the residues is mutated to alanine (Fig. 3 A). The proline and methionine also contribute (Fig. 3 A), defining the pentapeptide core (YPWM) as the 10D11 epitope. Epitope mapping of 10D11 mAb was confirmed functionally by the ability of the antibody to supershift wild type and alanine scanning mutants of HOXD4 (Fig. 1 B). In this assay, the antibody did not supershift the tyrosine and tryptophan mutants (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2, 8, and 12) and only weakly supershifted the methionine and proline mutants (Fig. 3 B,lanes 10 and 14). As seen by ELISA (Fig.3 A), flanking residues N-terminal and C-terminal to the YPWM core did not contribute to the epitope with the possible exception of V2 (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). Taken together, the results of the epitope mapping show that the 10D11 mAb is specific against the core YPWM motif. Binding of the antibody to HOXD4 protein does not interfere with HOXD4 monomer binding to the DNA probe; nor does the mAb spuriously interact with the DNA probe (Fig. 3 B, lane 19). Since 10D11 mAb is highly specific for the YPWM region of HOXD4, we tested its ability to prevent or disrupt HOX/PBX interactions. We co-incubated 10D11 mAb with HOXD4 and either PBX1A or E2A-PBX1A (39Kamps M.P. Murre C. Sun X.-H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 60: 547-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 40Nourse J. Mellentin J.D. Galili N. Wilkinson J. Starbridge E. Smith S.D. Cleary M.L. Cell. 1990; 60: 535-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) in EMSA. We found that cooperative complex formation of PBX1A or E2A-PBX1A with HOXD4 (Fig.4 A, lanes 2 and 6) was abrogated by co-incubation with 10D11 mAb (Fig. 4 A,lanes 4 and 8). Similarly, when HOXD4 alone was preincubated with 10D11 mAb before the addition of PBX1A, the cooperative complex failed to form (Fig. 4 A, lane 9). A cooperative complex could be recovered by preblocking the 10D11 monoclonal antibody with nearly equimolar concentration of YPWM peptide to an in vitro reaction containing HOX, PBX1A, and 10D11 (Fig. 4 A, lane 5). We made use of a monoclonal antibody against the E2A portion of E2A-PBX1A to supershift the DNA-bound HOXD4·E2A-PBX1A cooperative complex (Fig.4 A, lane 7). By contrast, 10D11 does not form a supershifted complex, consistent with its ability to prevent the formation of HOX·E2A-PBX1A heterodimers on DNA. The addition of the 10D11 mAb to a preformed HOXD4·PBX1A complex resulted in disruption of more than 50% of the cooperative complex (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 10 and 2). Thus, 10D11 mAb can prevent and partially disrupt HOX·PBX complexes, emphasizing the importance of the YPWM for HOX/PBX interactions. The pentapeptide of HOXA1 differs from that of HOXD4 at two positions within the 10D11 mAb epitope (Fig. 1 C). Unlike results with HOXD4, 10D11 mAb was unable to supershift HOXA1 bound to DNA as a monomer (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 2); nor could 10D11 mAb interfere with HOXA1·PBX1A cooperative complex formation in vitro (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3and 4). We conclude that abrogation of HOXD4·PBX1A complex formation by 10D11 is specific and dependent on the YPWM epitope. Residues flanking the YPWM motif in HOX proteins are well conserved among members of the same paralogous group but can vary significantly between proteins of two different paralogous groups (Fig. 1 C). We used alanine scanning mutants of HOXD4 (Fig. 1 B) to test the importance of residues within and flanking the YPWM for the modulation of HOX/PBX interactions. Steady state EMSA was performed to look for both HOX monomer and HOX·PBX cooperative complex binding defects on two different probes, A6 and G6, that differ at the sixth position of the cooperative binding site in DNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). We and others have previously shown the sixth position to affect complex stability and the specificity of HOX·PBX binding (28Chang C.-P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.-F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 32Phelan M. Featherstone M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8635-8643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although there was no difference in the monomer binding to either probe (Fig.5, A and B, lanes 5,7, 9, 11, 13,15, 17, and 19), the tyrosine, tryptophan, and methionine of HOXD4 were each required to form a cooperative complex with PBX1A on both of the probes (Fig. 5,A and B, lanes 10, 14, and16). The ability of P4A to cooperate with PBX1A was significantly affected on a G6 probe (Fig. 5 B, lane 12), and mutation of the first valine reduced cooperation with PBX1A by 80% on the G6 probe (Fig. 5 B, lane 6). Conversion of the second valine to alanine had a more dramatic effect, with more than 90% reduction in the cooperative complex on both A6 and G6 probes (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 8). The flanking lysines C-terminal to the YPWM did not show a difference in their interaction with PBX1A on either probe (Fig. 5, Aand B, lanes 18 and 20). To further investigate the contribution of residues within and flanking the YPWM to HOX/PBX interactions, we measured the dissociation rates of the cooperative complexes. Tryptophan and methionine mutants were not tested, since there was no observable complex formed. Tyrosine to alanine was tested, since a very weak complex was observed on longer exposures. Dissociation rate EMSAs were performed to study the stability of HOX·PBX cooperative complexes on a heterodimeric site with position 6 occupied by A, G, or T. The half-lives of the HOX·PBX1A complexes for the A6, G6, and T6 probes are summarized in Table I. There are two striking observations. First, all residues made a significant contribution to stability on at least one of the three probes tested. Second, the importance of a given residue for complex stability is dependent on base identity at position 6.Table IMeasure of the stability of HOX · PBX complexes on a consensus HOX · PBX site that differs at position 6ProteinsStabilityTGATTAATTGATTGATTGATTTAT%HOXD41001-aHalf-lives in minutes for wild type HOXD4 are as follows: 16 (A6 probe); 32 (G6 probe); 31 (T6 probe).1001-aHalf-lives in minutes for wild type HOXD4 are as follows: 16 (A6 probe); 32 (G6 probe); 31 (T6 probe).1001-aHalf-lives in minutes for wild type HOXD4 are as follows: 16 (A6 probe); 32 (G6 probe); 31 (T6 probe).HOXD4 (V1A)55 ± 173 ± 674 ± 8HOXD4 (V2A)27 ± 339 ± 131 ± 5HOXD4 (Y3A)12 ± 46 ± 040 ± 1HOXD4 (P4A)61 ± 677 ± 1281 ± 5HOXD4 (K7A)46 ± 386 ± 363 ± 7HOXD4 (K8A)36 ± 179 ± 645 ± 0S.E. is shown for each value.

Although the proline to alanine change (P4A) did not seem to affect steady state binding (Fig. 5), there was some loss of stability on the A6 probe (Table I). While mutation of tyrosine (Y3A) reduced complex stability 8- and 17-fold on A6 and G6 sites, there was only a 2.5-fold drop on the T6 probe. Conversion of the first valine (V1A) caused a 2-fold decrease in complex stability on an A6 probe, while mutation of the second valine (V2A) decreased stability by 4-fold on this same site. The V2A mutant also displayed 2–4-fold reduced stability on the remaining two probes. The two flanking lysines contribute significantly to the"

The type V TGF-β receptor exhibits a Ser/Thr-specific protein kinase activity with distinct substrate specificity (Liu, Q., Huang, S. S., and Huang, J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 9221–9226). In mink lung epithelial cells, the type V TGF-β receptor was found to form heterocomplexes with the type I TGF-β receptor by immunoprecipitation with antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor after 125I-TGF-β affinity labeling or Trans35S-label metabolic labeling of the cells. The kinase activity of the type V TGF-β receptor was stimulated after treatment of mink lung epithelial cells with TGF-β. TGF-β stimulation resulted in the growth inhibition of wild-type mink lung epithelial cells and to a lesser extent of the type I and type II TGF-β receptor-defective mutants, although higher concentrations of TGF-β were required for the growth inhibition of these mutants. TGF-β was unable to induce growth inhibition in human colorectal carcinoma cells lacking the type V TGF-β receptor but expressing the type I and type II TGF-β receptors. These results suggest that the type V TGF-β receptor can mediate the TGF-β-induced growth inhibitory response in the absence of the type I or type II TGF-β receptor.

Materials—Na125I (17 Ci/mg), [γ-32P]ATP (4,500 Ci/mmol), and Trans35S-label (1,000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from ICN Biochemicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA). [γ-32P]ATP was diluted with unlabeled ATP to have a specific radioactivity of ∼104 cpm/pmol. Molecular mass protein standards (myosin, 205 kDa; β-galactosidase, 116 kDa; phosphorylase, 97 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; ovalbumin, 45 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa), poly-l-lysine HBr (M r15,000–30,000), β-mercaptoethanol, glycerol, Triton X-100, and other chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma. TGF-β1 was purchased from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was obainted from Pierce. Peptide antigen, a hexadecapeptide containing the ATP binding site amino acid sequence (6O'Grady P Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

Recombinant human nonglycosylated insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) was provided by Celtrix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). TGF-β receptor-defective mutants (DR26 and R1-B cells) and type II TGF-β receptor cDNA and neo-vector stably transfected hereditary human colorectal carcinoma cells (RII-37 and HCT 116 Neo cells) were provided by Drs. Joan Massagué and Michael G. Brattain, respectively. Mink lung epithelial cells have been routinely maintained in the laboratory. All cultured cells were grown in 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor was raised in rabbits with the conjugate of bovine thyroglobulin and peptide antigen (a hexadecapeptide), whose amino acid sequence was derived from the ATP binding site amino acid sequence of the type V TGF-β receptor (6O'Grady P Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21035-21037Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The peptide antigen was conjugated to bovine thyroglobulin according to the procedure of Huang and Huang (13Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor did not show reactivity to the type I and type II TGF-β receptors based on Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation of 125I-TGF-β affinity labeled or Trans35S-label metabolically labeled type I and type II TGF-β receptors from mink lung epithelial cells in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The type V TGF-β receptor was purified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography after Triton X-100 extraction of bovine liver plasma membranes and wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 4B affinity column chromatography as described previously (4O'Grady P. Kuo M.-D. Baldassare J.J. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8583-8589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About 0.1 μg of the type V TGF-β receptor from bovine liver plasma membranes was subjected to 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by electrophoretic transblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran). Western blot analysis of the type V TGF-β receptor was performed as described previously (14Lokeshwar V.B. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1665-1675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor (1:100 dilution) with or without peptide antigen (0.5 mm). Mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells) were grown to confluence on P-60 Petri dishes and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate according to the procedure of Huang and Huang (13Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monolayers were then treated with 0.1 nm TGF-β1 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pH 7.4, at 0 °C for 30 min. The cells were then detached and lysed in 100 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 125 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. After centrifugation, the Triton X-100 extracts were then diluted 10-fold with Triton X-100-free buffer and incubated with antiserum or nonimmune serum (1:100 dilution) at 0 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were precipitated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose (50%, v/v). After washing with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% Triton X-100, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and autoradiography. The relative intensity of 32P-labeled type V TGF-β receptor on the autoradiogram was quantitated by a PhosphorImager. Mink lung epithelial cells (wild-type, DR26, and R1B cells) and hereditary human colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT 116 Neo and RII-37 cells) grown on P-60 Petri dishes were incubated with 125I-TGF-β1(0.5, 1, and 1.5 nm) in binding buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 128 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgSO4, and 1.2 mmCaCl2) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin at 0 °C for 2.5 h. The affinity labeling of cell surface TGF-β receptors was carried out as described previously (4O'Grady P. Kuo M.-D. Baldassare J.J. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

The125I-TGF-β1 affinity labeled receptors were then analyzed by 5.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and autoradiography. The immunoprecipitation of the type V TGF-β receptor in mink lung epithelial cells treated with and without 0.1 nm TGF-β1 at 0 °C for 30 min was carried out in 0.1% Triton X-100 as described above, except the cells were not metabolically labeled. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with 0.2 μm recombinant nonglycosylated human IGFBP-3 in 50 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, and 2.5 mm MnCl2. An aliquot of the reaction mixture was then analyzed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and autoradiography. The relative intensity of 32P-IGFBP-3 on the autoradiogram was quantitated by a PhosphorImager.

The cells were then detached and lysed with Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 125 mm NaCl2, and 1 mm EDTA) or RIPA buffer (1% sodium droxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.15m NaCl). After centrifugation, the Triton X-100 (final concentration, 0.1%) or RIPA buffer extracts were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor (1:100 dilution). The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by 5.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Mink lung epithelial cells were grown to confluence on P-60 Petri dishes and affinity labeled with 125I-TGF-β in the presence of DSS as described previously (4O'Grady P. Kuo M.-D. Baldassare J.J.

After centrifugation, the Triton X-100 buffer extracts were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor (1:100 dilution).

Wild-type mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells), mutants (R-1B and DR26 cells), and human colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT 116 Neo and RII-37 cells) were plated on 24-well clustered dishes and incubated with various concentrations of TGF-β1 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. After incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, the cells were pulse-labeled with 1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were then washed twice with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed once with 0.5 ml of ethanol:ether (2:1, v/v), and dissolved in 0.2 n NaOH. The [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by a scintillation counter.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22215-22218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To see whether the type V TGF-β receptor formed heterocomplexes with other TGF-β receptors, we performed immunoprecipitations of the type V TGF-β receptor and other TGF-β receptors using specific antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor. The specificity of the antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor had been validated by two types of evidence. First, the antiserum reacted with the type V TGF-β receptor in Western blot analysis. Fig.1 shows that the antiserum specifically reacted with the type V TGF-β receptor and its proteolytic product (∼300 kDa) from bovine liver plasma membranes on the Western blot analysis (Fig.1 A, lane 1). The reaction was blocked in the presence of 0.5 mm peptide antigen (Fig. 1 A,lane 2). Second, the antiserum was also able to immunoprecipitate the type V TGF-β receptor in normal mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells) that were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in response to TGF-β1stimulation (Fig. 1 B). The immunoprecipitated type V receptor exhibited a kinase activity toward IGFBP-3 (Fig.1 C). IGFBP-3 is a nonphysiological substrate for the type V TGF-β receptor but contains several SXE motifs that serve as the phosphorylation sites for the type V TGF-β receptor kinase activity (7Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactive band at the top of the separating gel (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 2) was identified as the TGF-β1-stimulated and -unstimulated autophosphorylated type V TGF-β receptor that could be removed by subsequent immunoprecipitation with antiserum to the type V receptor in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The TGF-β1-stimulated phosphorylation of the type V TGF-β receptor and the TGF-β1-stimulated kinase activity of the type V TGF-β receptor on IGFBP-3 were both estimated to be ∼1.5-fold greater than those observed without TGF-β1 stimulation (Fig. 1,B and C, lanes 1 and 2). This 1.5-fold stimulation was comparable with that observed for the TGF-β1-stimulated kinase activity of the type V TGF-β receptor purified from bovine liver plasma membranes (7Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Normal mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells) have been commonly used to examine the cross-interaction of the TGF-β receptors and TGF-β-induced signal transduction. They express all the known TGF-β receptors (type I, type II, type III, and type V TGF-β receptors) and exhibit both growth inhibition and transcriptional activation in response to TGF-β stimulation (5O'Grady P. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Boyd F.T. Massagué J. J. Biol.

In this study, the125I-labeled TGF-β1 affinity labeled cell surface receptors were immunoprecipitated with the antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor, after mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells) had been incubated with 0.1 nm125I-TGF-β1 for 2 ½ h at 0 °C, exposed to the cross-linking reagent DSS, and extracted with Triton X-100 buffer. The immunoprecipitates of the Triton X-100 buffer extracts were then analyzed by 5.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the type I TGF-β receptor was co-immunoprecipitated with the type V TGF-β receptor (Fig.2 A, lane 2). The immunoprecipitation efficiency for the type V TGF-β receptor was estimated to be approximately 30% of the total labeled receptor (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Excess peptide antigen blocked the immunoprecipitation of the TGF-β receptors (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Nonimmune serum did not immunoprecipitate the TGF-β receptors (Fig. 2 A,lane 4). These results suggest that on the cell surface of mink lung epithelial cells, the type V TGF-β receptor forms heterocomplexes with the type I TGF-β receptor in the presence of the ligand. To see whether the ligand was required for the heterocomplex formation, the TGF-β receptors were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to the type V TGF-β receptor after mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells) had been metabolically labeled with Trans35S-label in the absence of exogenous ligand and extracted with Triton X-100 buffer or RIPA buffer (13Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates of the Triton X-100 or RIPA buffer extracts were analyzed by 5.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and fluorography. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the type V and type I (53 kDa) TGF-β receptors were found in the immunoprecipitates of the Triton X-100 buffer extracts (Fig. 2 B, lane 3), whereas only the type V TGF-β receptor was detected in the immunoprecipitates of the RIPA buffer extracts (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). A 68-kDa protein was also identified in the immunoprecipitates of the Triton X-100 buffer extracts (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). This protein was possibly an isoform or differentially glycosylated form of the type I TGF-β receptor because two different molecular mass isoforms of the type I TGF-β receptor were also identified in the125I-TGF-β1 affinity labeling experiment (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2). RIPA buffer contained 0.1% SDS that destabilized the heterocomplexes of the type V and type I TGF-β receptors. In the presence of RIPA buffer, only the type V TGF-β receptor was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2 B,lane 1). Because no endogenous TGF-β activity (growth inhibitory activity) was detected under the cultured conditions and because exogenous TGF-β1 did not affect the complexation of 35S-labeled type V and type I TGF-β receptors (data not shown), these results suggest that the type V TGF-β receptor can form heterocomplexes with the type I TGF-β receptor in the absence of ligand. As described previously, mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells) have been a useful system for studying the roles of the type I and type II TGF-β receptors in TGF-β-induced cellular responses. Mutant cells defective for the type I or type II TGF-β receptor have been reported to be unable to exhibit growth inhibition and transcriptional activation following TGF-β stimulation (18Boyd F.T. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2272-2278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cheifetz S. Hernandez H. Laiho M. ten Dijke P. Iwata K.K. Massagué J. J. Biol.

However, the growth inhibition and transcriptional activation could be restored by genetic complementation between cells defective in the type I and type II TGF-β receptors (21Laiho M. Weis F.M.B. Boyd F.T. Ignotz R.A. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9108-9112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No study on the expression of the type V TGF-β receptor in these mutants has been reported. To test its presence, we investigated the expression of the type V TGF-β receptor in these mutants. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), both the type II and type I TGF-β receptor-defective mutants (DR26 and R-1B cells, respectively) did express the type V TGF-β receptor, which was identified as the 400-kDa125I-TGF-β1 affinity labeled protein. It is of importance to note that the type I TGF-β receptor-defective mutant (R-1B cells) expressed less of the type V TGF-β receptor when compared with the type II TGF-β receptor-defective mutant (DR26 cells). Because both mutants (DR26 and R-1B cells) express the type V TGF-β receptor, an important role of the type V TGF-β receptor in TGF-β-induced cellular responses cannot be excluded in the genetic complementation experiments of the mutants (21Laiho M. Weis F.M.B. Boyd F.T. Ignotz R.A. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9108-9112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the type V TGF-β receptor mediated a TGF-β-induced growth inhibition, we investigated the effect of higher concentrations of TGF-β1 on [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of mink lung epithelial cells (Fig.3 C). The K d values for TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 binding to the type V receptor are approximately 40-fold higher than those for the type I and type II TGF-β receptors (6O'Grady P Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21035-21037Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). If the type V TGF-β receptor can mediate a TGF-β-induced growth inhibition, TGF-β at higher concentrations should inhibit the DNA synthesis in the type I and type II TGF-β receptor-defective mutants. At ∼50–100 pm, TGF-β1 induced a small but significant inhibition of DNA synthesis (Fig. 3 C) in both mutants (∼20–40%). In type II TGF-β receptor-defective mutant cells (DR26 cells), the inhibition of DNA synthesis showed a small downward trend at ≥125 pm(Fig. 3 C), but higher concentrations of TGF-β1(∼500 pm) did not cause a further decrease (30 ± 4% inhibition). A smaller degree of inhibition of DNA synthesis by TGF-β1 in type II TGF-β receptor-defective mutants was previously reported but was not discussed (20Laiho M. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18518-18524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the type V TGF-β receptor may mediate the growth inhibition in the absence of the type I or type II TGF-β receptor, although a higher level of ligand is required for the type V TGF-β receptor-mediated growth inhibition. In the wild-type cells (Mv1Lu cells) containing all TGF-β receptors, the maximal inhibition was observed at ∼1 pm of TGF-β1. In a previous study, we reported that several carcinoma cells lacked the type V TGF-β receptor and other TGF-β receptors (5O'Grady P. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These cells lacking the type V TGF-β receptor (MCF-7 and PC-12 cells) have been found not to respond to TGF-β stimulation with respect to growth inhibitory response (5O'Grady P. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 2Q. Liu, S. S. Huang, and J. S. Huang, unpublished results. Recently, heriditary human colorectal carcinoma cells (HCT 116 cells) were shown to be deficient in the type II TGF-β receptor (22Wang J. Sun L. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Wilson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Stable transfection of these colorectal carcinoma cells with the type II TGF-β receptor cDNA was found to rescue the transcriptional response but failed to restore the growth inhibitory response to exogenous TGF-β (22Wang J. Sun L. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Wilson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The inability of the transfected colorectal carcinoma cells to exert growth inhibitory response to TGF-β stimulation was also confirmed in our laboratory. One of the possibilities for the failure to restore the growth inhibitory response could be the lack of the type V TGF-β receptor expression in cells stably transfected with the neo-vector only (HCT 116 Neo cells) or with vector expressing the type II TGF-β receptor cDNA (RII-37 cells). To test this possibility, we performed the125I-TGF-β1 affinity labeling of the TGF-β receptors in these cells. No detectable type V TGF-β receptor was found in these cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4). The type III and type II TGF-β receptors were detected in RII-37 cells (Fig. 4, lane 3). The type I TGF-β receptor migrated at the dye front and could not be identified in the 5% polyacrylamide system (Fig. 4, lane 3). Absence of the type V TGF-β receptor was confirmed by the observation that the type V TGF-β receptor antigen was not detected by Western blot analysis in HCT 116 Neo and RII-37 cells (data not shown). These results and the results from several experiments as shown in Fig. 3 can be summarized in TableI. The type V TGF-β appears to be critical for TGF-β-induced growth inhibition. The type I and type II TGF-β receptors are required for the maximal growth inhibition induced by TGF-β. Together with the observation that only transformed epithelial cells (carcinoma cells) have been found to lack the expression of detectable type V TGF-β receptor (5O'Grady P. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), these results also support the hypothesis that loss of the type V TGF-β receptor may contribute to the transformed state of certain carcinoma cells (e.g.hereditary human colorectal carcinoma cells) (5O'Grady P. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Table ITGF-β induced growth inhibition in wild-type mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells), type I and type II TGF-β receptor-defective mutants (R-1B and DR26 cells), and human colorectal carcinoma cells lacking the type V TGF-β receptor (HCT 116 Neo and RII-37 cells)CellTGF-β receptor/kinase type1-aThe TGF-β receptor types were determined by125I-TGF-β affinity labeling.

Open table in a new tab Together with the previous observations of distinct substrate specificities of the type V, type I, and type II TGF-β receptors (7Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Luo K. Zhou P. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11761-11765Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the finding of heterocomplex formation of the type V TGF-β receptor and type I TGF-β receptor reported here raise an important question: What role does the type V TGF-β receptor play in various cellular responses induced by three different TGF-β isoforms (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3)? The cellular responses induced by the TGF-β isoforms can vary substantially (1Moses H.L. Yang E.Y. Pietenpol J.A.

The molecular mechanisms of the opposite effects of TGF-β3 versus TGF-β1or TGF-β2 (25Shah M. Foreman D.M. Ferguson M.W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 985-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are not easy to interpret within a model in which only the type I and type II TGF-β receptor heterocomplex mediates the signaling. The type V TGF-β receptor could be involved in these diverse cellular responses due to its distinct kinase substrate specificity (acidotrophic kinase activity versusthe basic-trophic kinase activities of the type I and type II TGF-β receptors) (7Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Luo K. Zhou P. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The distinct substrate specificity of the type V TGF-β receptor implies a different signaling pathway from those of the type I and type II TGF-β receptors. Segregation of growth inhibitory and transcriptional responses induced by TGF-β has been reported (22Wang J. Sun L. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S.

Science. 1993; 262: 900-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The signaling pathway mediated by the type V TGF-β receptor could be important for growth inhibitory response but not obligatory for transcriptional response (the activation of transcription of fibronectin, collagen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 genes) (22Wang J. Sun L. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Wilson J.K.V. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The cross-modulation of the two pathways mediated by the type V/I and type II/I TGF-β receptors should be determined by the affinities of TGF-β isoforms to the TGF-β receptors and extracellular concentrations of TGF-β isoforms. The binding affinities of TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3 for the type I and type II TGF-β receptors are very similar withK d of ∼0.01 nm (24Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1067-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). TheK d of the type V TGF-β receptor for TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3 have been estimated to be ∼0.4 nm, ∼0.4 nm, and ∼5 nm, respectively (7Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).2 Low concentrations of TGF-β3 might favor the formation of the type I and type II TGF-β receptor heterocomplexes that do not include the type V TGF-β receptor. Under the condition in which the amount of the type I receptor is limiting compared with those of other TGF-β receptors, TGF-β3 could alter the availability of the type I TGF-β receptor when the formation of type I and type V TGF-β receptor heterocomplex is required for certain cellular responses induced by TGF-β1 or TGF-β2.

These domains contain multiple binding sites for heparin and for various cell-surface receptors that modulate cell function. To examine the role that the high affinity heparin-binding region and the alternatively spliced V region of fibronectin play in tumor invasion, we expressed and purified four complementary recombinant fibronectin proteins. These proteins either included or excluded the alternatively spliced V region and contained either a mutated, non-functional high affinity heparin-binding domain (Hep−) or an unmutated heparin-binding domain (Hep+). Cultured oral squamous cell carcinoma cells were assayed for invasion into a Matrigel/collagen matrix supplemented with these four purified recombinant proteins, and for spreading and motility on plastic. Increased invasion was observed in gels supplemented with the V−Hep+ protein when compared with the V−Hep− protein. Inclusion of the V region in the proteins enhanced the invasion and migration associated with both Hep+ and Hep−proteins, whereas cell spreading was enhanced with the Hep+recombinant proteins. These data demonstrate that both the high affinity heparin-binding domain and the V region of fibronectin play important roles in invasion, motility, and spreading of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.

Squamous cell carcinomas are the most common type of malignant oral neoplasm and account for a major portion of deaths related to oral cancer. These tumors represent 4% of all cancers of males in the United States, but in some Asian countries they are the most common malignant tumor. At present the survival rate approximates 50% and has not improved significantly in patients treated over the past several decades (1Regezi J.A. Sciubba J. Oral Pathology: Clinical-Pathologic Correlations. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1993: 77-79Google Scholar). Much of the morbidity and mortality associated with these tumors is related to their invasive characteristics. Studies relating to mechanisms used by squamous cell carcinomas for adhesion, motility, and invasion are, therefore, an important aspect of cancer therapy. Previous studies have implicated cell-surface receptors belonging to the integrin and the proteoglycan families in the invasion and metastasis of tumors (2Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Yamada K.M.

Since some of these adhesive interactions can be blocked by small synthetic peptides derived from ECM molecules, peptide blocking experiments have also identified specific molecules that are potentially useful for therapy (7Wahl S.M.

One such molecule which has been studied for its potential therapeutic use is fibronectin (FN), an ECM adhesion molecule composed of multiple functional domains that interact with multiple cell-surface receptors. The domains are composed of repeating structural units, as evidenced by sequence homology, and are designated as type I, type II, and type III repeats. Repeats are numbered from the amino terminus of the molecule. The functional regions include a cell-binding domain, which contains an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) adhesive sequence, and a carboxyl-terminal heparin-binding domain (8Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 115-126Google Scholar, 9Yamada K.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The translated protein also includes additional regions that arise through alternative splicing. In rat FN these domains are designated EIIIB, EIIIA, and the V region (see Fig. 1). Many cell-surface receptors interact with specific portions of the FN molecule. The RGD site in the 10th type III repeat (III-10) has been shown to interact with both the α5β1 (10Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1985; 40: 191-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) and αvβ1 integrins (11Vogel B.E. Tarone G. Giancotti F.G. Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J.

The α4β1 integrin binds to the V region as well as to sequences in the adjacent 14th type III repeat (III-14) (12Mould P.A. Humphries M.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4089-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). FN also contains numerous heparin-binding sites within the carboxyl-terminal portion of the molecule, including a high affinity binding site in the 13th type III (III-13) repeat and multiple low affinity binding sites within III-14 (5Iida J.

Although many domains of FN have been implicated in mediating tumor cell functions, the contributions of each domain and the relative importance of each family of receptors to these processes are difficult to assess. However, these evaluations are important since they may suggest potential therapeutic interventions by targeting the portions of the FN molecule that play the greatest role in the invasion process. These inquiries are often best made using recombinant proteins that exhibit altered function because of specific point mutations rather than deletions of large protein segments, which may alter protein function nonspecifically. In the present study, we used four different purified recombinant FN proteins, with or without function-perturbing point mutations in the high affinity heparin-binding region and with or without the alternatively spliced V region, to evaluate the relative contributions of these domains to the process of invasion by oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Our results showed that the high affinity heparin-binding domain and the alternatively spliced V region of FN both contribute to the invasive behavior of these cells. Growth factor reduced Matrigel basement membrane matrix was purchased from Collaborative Biochemical Products, Bedford, MA. Vitrogen 100-purified collagen was purchased from the Collagen Corp., Palo Alto, CA. Nutridoma-HU, a serum-free medium supplement, was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Transwell porous cell culture inserts, polycarbonate membranes in 24-well plates (6.5 mm diameter, 8.0 mm pore size), were purchased from Costar, Cambridge, MA. Human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells (HSC-3 and HOC313) were a gift from Dr. Randall Kramer (University of California, San Francisco) and have been described previously (21Matsumoto K. Horikoshi M. Rikimaru M. Enomoto S. J. Oral Pathol. Med. 1989; 18: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. Rat fibronectin cDNA was engineered between type III repeats 10 and 15 (Fig. 1 A) to form four constructs, which were expressed as recombinant FN proteins and subsequently purified. The proteins spanned repeats III-10 to III-15, and all contained the RGD cell-binding region in III-10, the alternatively spliced EIIIA type III repeat, and the low affinity heparin-binding sequences in the carboxyl-terminal heparin-binding domain. However, the proteins either included (V+) or excluded (V−) the alternatively spliced V region and differed in the high affinity heparin-binding region of III-13 (22Barkalow F.J.B. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7812-7818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter region, two point mutations were introduced into the cDNA to replace adjacent arginine residues with threonines (Fig.1 B). Since the threonine mutations have subsequently been shown to virtually abrogate heparin-binding function, these recombinant proteins have been designated as either Hep+ for the unmutated protein or Hep− for the mutated protein. The four proteins are therefore identified as V−Hep+, V−Hep−, V+Hep+, and V+Hep−. The cDNAs used to generate the four recombinant proteins were engineered in two parts as follows. The cDNAs corresponding to repeats III-13, -14, and -15 between the 5′ ApaI and 3′HincII restriction sites in the FN cDNA were cloned into the pECE expression plasmid (23Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Two cDNAs that either included or excluded the V region were used. The 3′ HincII portion was ligated into the blunted XbaI site of the pECE polylinker to attach an engineered three-frame stop within the vector to the 3′ end of the FN cDNA fragment. The ApaI restriction site was used to insert synthetic oligonucleotides into the 5′ end of III-13. These nucleotides introduced an XbaI restriction site into the cDNA corresponding to the hinge region between III-13 and III-12 in the FN protein (Fig. 1 B, shown in bold type). The new restriction site was engineered by altering a single nucleotide in the FN cDNA at the third position of a codon. This mutation preserved the protein sequence of the cDNA but inserted a unique restriction site, the XbaI recognition sequence, into the gene. The FN sequence between XbaI andApaI could then be altered by inserting synthetic oligonucleotides between these two restriction sites. As indicated in Fig. 1 B, one such pair of oligonucleotides was inserted between these restriction sites to mutate adjacent arginine residues to threonines. This mutation was subsequently shown to virtually abrogate heparin-binding function in the expressed recombinant protein. The region engineered between III-13 and III-15 in the pECE expression vector was removed from the plasmid by digesting with XbaI and EcoRI. EcoRI digests within the plasmid vector downstream from the three-frame stop and polyadenylation sequence. The cDNA fragment removed from pECE therefore contained repeats III-13 to III-15, an engineered translation termination site and a polyadenylation sequence. This cDNA fragment was bounded by restriction sites for XbaI and EcoRI. Thus, fragments containing the adjacent arginines as well as fragments with adjacent arginines mutated to threonines were isolated. Each of these fragments also contained cDNA in which the V region was either present or removed by alternative splicing. The upstream portion of the FN cDNA between type III repeats 10 and 13 was engineered by adding restriction sites, using primers in a polymerase chain reaction. These primers introduced the unique restriction site for XbaI at the 3′ end (in the hinge region between III-12 and III-13) and a second site for XhoI at the 5′ end (in the cDNA corresponding to the hinge region between III-9 and III-10 in the FN protein). Sense primers (5′-AA TCT CGA GTT TCC GAT GTC GGC TCT-3′) provided the recognition sequence (CTCGAG) forXhoI. Antisense primers (5′-TT CTC TAG AGT CGT GAC GAC TCC CTG AGC-3′) provided the recognition sequence (TCTAGA) forXbaI. The product of the polymerase chain reaction was therefore bounded by restriction sites for XhoI andXbaI. Products were subcloned into TA subcloning vectors (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and inserts were removed by digestion with these two restriction enzymes. Two cDNA fragments (III-10 to III-13 and III-13 to III-15) were then ligated into the pTrcHis-C bacterial expression plasmid (Invitrogen) in a three-part ligation as follows. The cDNA inserts encoding repeats III-10 to III-13 were bounded by XbaI andXhoI. The cDNA inserts encoding repeats III-13 to III-15 plus terminator were bounded by XbaI and EcoRI. These two cDNA fragments were ligated into the pTrcHis-C expression plasmid vector (in the appropriate reading frame) following digestion with XhoI and EcoRI. The two resulting sets of expression plasmids contained type III repeats 10–15, with the FN sequences stopping and starting in the hinge regions of the FN molecule adjacent to these repeats. The V region was either included or excluded in each set, as was the Hep+ or Hep− sequence. Initiation and termination signals were provided by the pTrcHis-C expression plasmid and the three-frame stop from the pECE plasmid. All expressed proteins also contained the six-histidine (His6) purification sequence on the amino terminus, which was used for purification with metal-binding columns (Invitrogen). Proteins were eluted from the columns under denaturing conditions (pH 5.0) and were separated from bacterial proteins, as described by the manufacturer. After purification, elution buffer was removed by passage over G25 Sepharose columns. All of the recombinant FN proteins contained the 10th type III repeat (with the RGD cell-binding region), the alternatively spliced EIIIA domain, and the 11th to 15th type III repeats, which include the low affinity heparin-binding sequences in the carboxyl-terminal heparin-binding domain. These four proteins also either included or excluded the V region, and they differed in III-13 such that it either contained the adjacent arginines or the substituted threonines. The predicted molecular masses of the four recombinant proteins are 69.3 kDa for the V− proteins and 82.5 kDa for the V+ proteins. The four recombinant proteins were analyzed by standard sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% polyacrylamide gels stained with 0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 and destained in a solution of 50% methanol and 5% glacial acetic acid. The proteins were further positively identified by standard Western immunoblots probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody to rat FN (24Peters J.H. Trevithick J.E. Johnson P.W. Hynes R.O. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), used at a dilution of 1:200. Primary antibody was then exposed to an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) used at a dilution of 1:5000. Bound antibody was detected using nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, toluidine (Promega, Madison, WI). The concentration of the four recombinant proteins was determined by comparison to a standard curve of sequential dilutions of bovine serum albumin. Molecular mass standards (Life Technologies, Inc.) for electrophoresis included the following prestained proteins with apparent molecular mass as follows: myosin (214 kDa), phosphorylaseb (111 kDa), bovine serum albumin (74 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), β-lactoglobulin (18 kDa), and lysozyme (15 kDa). To determine the presence or absence of heparin-binding function, the V− recombinant proteins were analyzed for binding to heparin-Sepharose. Heparin-Sepharose columns were prepared by packing Poly-Prep chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) with heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The column was then equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and the sample was applied to the column and allowed to adhere to the heparin-Sepharose matrix for 6 h at 4 °C. Then, the sample was eluted from the column, using a continuous salt gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Fractions of 3 ml were collected for each of the assays and analyzed using standard Western immunoblots as described above. In vitro assays for invasion were conducted as described previously (25Janiak M. Hashmi H.R. Janowski-Wieczorek A. Exp. Hematol. 1994; 22: 559-565PubMed Google Scholar). The gel solution was prepared by mixing 300 μl of a Matrigel solution and 300 μl of a collagen solution (Vitrogen, final concentration of collagen 0.8 mg/ml). The Matrigel solution was prepared by mixing 200 μl of Matrigel with 100 μl of serum-free medium, which contained α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.66 × Nutridoma solution, 0.036 mg/ml sodium pyruvate, and 3.3 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The collagen solution contained 1.6 mg/ml collagen, 25 μl of a 10 × phosphate-buffered saline that was calcium- and magnesium-free (PBS-CMF), 125 μl of a 1 × PBS-CMF solution, and 6.6 mm NaOH. The test proteins were subsequently added to this combined gel solution to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The control gels contained the gel solution without the test protein. The gel solution was coated onto polycarbonate filters inside the Costar inserts in 24-well plates and allowed to set for 1 h at 37 °C before cells were added to the wells. The transwell membranes were coated with 10 μl of the gel solution. Following preparation and setting of the gels, human squamous cell carcinoma cells were trypsinized, pelleted, rinsed twice with serum-free medium, and counted. A 200-μl aliquot from a suspension of 1 × 106 cells/ml was added to each well. Cells were allowed to invade the gel on the membrane filter for approximately 18 h. At the end of the incubation time, transwell filters were washed three times with PBS, fixed in a 1:3 glacial acetic acid:methanol solution for 30 min, washed three times with double distilled water, and stained for 15 min with 0.05 mg/ml of Hoechst stain (bis-benzimide 2′-[hydroxyphenyl]-5-[4-methyl 1–1-piperazinyl]-2,5′-bis-1H-benzimidazole; Sigma). Filters were washed another three times with double distilled water, placed on a glass slide, covered, and sealed to a glass coverslip using mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector, Burlingame, CA). The cells on the underside of the membrane that invaded the gel and passed through the pores of the membrane appeared bright against a dark background and were visualized for counting with an Axiophot Photomicroscope equipped with a filter for Hoechst stain detection (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The number of cells from five high power fields (400 ×) from each membrane was counted. Each experimental condition was tested in triplicate chambers, with cell counts averaged between the triplicate samples for each experiment. HSC-3 cells were trypsinized, pelleted under centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and suspended in control medium (serum-free α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at a density of 3 × 105cells/ml. 100 μl of this cell suspension was aliquoted per well into 96-well plates and subsequently incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The four recombinant FN proteins were added to the wells immediately before plating cells, yielding a final protein concentration of 100 μm/well. Cells were photographed after 2 h of incubation with the recombinant proteins at 200 × magnification (26Mooradian D.L. McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P.N. Cameron J.D. Furcht L.T. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 153-164PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were prepared as described for the cell adhesion assay, except that they were suspended at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml; 100 μl of this cell suspension was aliquoted per well into a 96-well plate. After 2 h of incubation, a scratch was made down the center of the well with a sterile needle, removing cells from this area and creating a clear zone into which cells could migrate (27Zhang K. Kramer R. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Photographs of the cell-free scratched area were taken, and then the 96-well plates were incubated for another 7 h. After this time, photographs were again taken to determine if cells had migrated into the scratched area in the presence of the recombinant test proteins. The diagrams in Fig. 1 A depict the III-10 to III-15 repeats of FN, which were expressed as fusion proteins in bacteria. These complementary proteins either included (V+) or excluded (V−) the V region and contained either the wild-type high affinity heparin-binding region (Hep+) or the mutated sequence (Hep−). The high affinity heparin-binding consensus sequence (22Barkalow F.J.B. Schwarzbauer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7812-7818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was mutated in III-13 to create the Hep− proteins (Fig. 1 B). Point mutations were incorporated into the FN cDNA such that in the resultant proteins, adjacent arginines were replaced with threonines. These mutations effectively abrogated heparin-binding function. Electrophoresis of the four purified recombinant FN proteins produced two bands at approximately 70 kDa, which correspond to the V−Hep+ and V−Hep−proteins (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and2, respectively), and two bands at approximately 80 kDa, which correspond to the V+Hep+ and V+Hep− proteins (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3 and 4, respectively). Proteins were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue to demonstrate efficacy of purification. The four recombinant proteins all reacted with a mouse monoclonal antibody to rat FN (24Peters J.H. Trevithick J.E. Johnson P.W. Hynes R.O. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 67-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). We examined the functional significance of the heparin-binding mutation by determining the ability of the V− proteins to bind to columns of heparin-Sepharose. The recombinant proteins were applied to the column and eluted in 3-ml fractions with continuous salt gradients from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl. Recombinant protein was detected in the 3-ml fractions by Western immunoblots. The mutated V−Hep− protein bound to heparin-Sepharose but eluted from the column in 0.07–0.08 m NaCl (Fig.3 A). In contrast, the native protein, V−Hep+ (Fig. 3 B), required approximately 0.5 m NaCl to elute. Since physiologic salt concentration is 0.14 m NaCl, the mutated protein would not bind heparin under physiologic conditions. Having purified and functionally characterized the recombinant FN proteins, we next examined the invasive properties of HSC-3 squamous carcinoma cells in response to these FN proteins in a collagen/Matrigel matrix. Initial assays performed with only the V−Hep+ and V−Hep−proteins demonstrated that both stimulated cell invasion, but that the Hep+ protein was more effective than the Hep−protein in facilitating this process (Fig. 4,B and C). There was at least a 3-fold increase in invasion in gels supplemented with the Hep+ protein as compared with gels supplemented with the Hep− protein (Table I). Additional experiments were performed with all four recombinant proteins (Table II). Both V+ proteins induced significantly elevated levels of invasion when compared with gels containing either the V−Hep− protein or Matrigel alone. The V−Hep+ protein was also more effective than the V−Hep− protein in facilitating invasion. The V−Hep− protein was marginally better at inducing invasion than was Matrigel alone.Table IInvasion of human squamous cell carcinoma cells into collagen-Matrigel supplemented with V − recombinant FN proteinsFragmentExperiments1-aThe total number of invading cells in 5 high power (400 ×) fields was counted.

The differential activity of the two H-strand transcription units and an H-strand transcription attenuation event at the 3′-end of the 16 S rRNA gene account for the fact that the rRNA genes and adjacent tRNA genes are transcribed to a 20 to 50 times higher rate than the downstream protein coding and tRNA genes (10Gelfand R. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1981; 1: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A central role in the attenuation phenomenon mentioned above is played by the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF), a DNA-binding protein that protects a 28-base pair DNA segment immediately adjacent and downstream of the 16 S rRNA/tRNALeu(UUR) boundary (11Kruse B.

Previous work carried out in our laboratory with a highly efficient RNA-synthesizing system utilizing isolated HeLa cell mitochondria (6Gaines G. Attardi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 451-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Gaines G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1605-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Gaines G. Rossi C. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1907-1915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that, in this system, the relative transcription rates of rRNA and mRNA can be modulated independently by ATP (8Gaines G. Rossi C. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1907-1915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by the intercalating drug EtBr (6Gaines G. Attardi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 451-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present work, the changes in the relative rates of rRNA and mRNA synthesis produced in response to ATP or EtBr have been correlated with the patterns of protein-DNA interactions in the transcription initiation and rDNA transcription termination regions of mtDNA, as detected by analysis of methylation interference in cultured human cells or in organelles isolated from HeLa cells. In particular, the significant ATP- and EtBr-related modifications observed in the footprint of the rRNA-specific promoter, which were specifically correlated with changes in the rate of rRNA synthesis, have given support to the model of two independently controlled overlapping H-strand transcription units (9Chomyn A. Attardi G. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1992: 483-509Google Scholar). Furthermore, no significant ATP effect on rDNA transcription termination has been detected. HeLa S3 cells were grown in suspension in high phosphate-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% calf serum. The human cell line 143B.TK−(25King M. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar) was grown on solid substrate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Samples of 107 to 108 HeLa S3 cells or 3 × 106 143B.TK− cells were routinely used. The methylation reaction, cell lysis, and total nucleic acid extraction were carried out as described previously (21Micol V. Fernández-Silva P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 3-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yield of total nucleic acids was 0.4 to 4.0 mg from each HeLa cell sample and ∼200 μg from each 143B.TK− cell sample. The mitochondrial fraction was isolated from 1.5 to 3.0 × 108 HeLa cells, essentially as described previously (8Gaines G. Rossi C. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1907-1915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resuspended in incubation buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol) and washed three times; the final pellet was then resuspended, at ∼2 mg/ml, in incubation buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 2.5 mm pyruvate, and the desired ATP or EtBr concentration. For each incubation condition tested, two 500-μl samples of the mitochondrial suspension were transferred into Eppendorf tubes, and to one of them, destined for analysis of RNA synthesis, 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol) was added. One of the two tubes was incubated at 37 °C under shaking for 20 min and the other for 30 min, and then DMS treatment or, respectively, RNA extraction was performed on the two samples, as detailed below. In particular, for DMS treatment, 26 μl of a freshly prepared 2% DMS solution in water was added to each mitochondrial suspension incubated for 20 min and allowed to react for 2 min at 37 °C, and then 900 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline was added, and the mitochondrial fraction was pelleted at 12,000 × g for 1 min. The DMS-treated mitochondrial fraction was washed three times by centrifugation and resuspension in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 400 μl of proteinase K buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (25 °C), 0.2m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) by vortexing, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The sample was then extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the nucleic acids were ethanol-precipitated as previously detailed forin vivo DMS-treated samples (21Micol V. Fernández-Silva P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 3-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each set of in organello footprinting experiments, a sample of the mitochondrial fraction was treated identically, except for the omission of DMS treatment, and DNA extracted from it for subsequent in vitroDMS treatment. For analysis of the in organello transcription products, after the 30 min incubation, the mitochondrial samples were pelleted at 12,000 × g for 1 min, washed, dissolved in proteinase K buffer, and digested for 10 min at 37 °C. The samples were then phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated; the RNA was electrophoresed on a 2.2 m formaldehyde, 1.4% agarose gel using MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, 10 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, at 25 °C), and the RNA bands were quantified, after drying the gel, using a PhosphorImager screen and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The DNA methylation was carried out on pellets containing about 200 μg of total nucleic acids deriving from non-DMS-treated cells or 5–10 μg of nucleic acids from untreated mitochondrial fractions as described elsewhere (21Micol V. Fernández-Silva P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 3-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was performed on pellets containing approximately 200 μg of total nucleic acids from DMS-treated cells or 5–10 μg of total nucleic acids from DMS-treated mitochondrial fractions and on equivalent samples of in vitro DMS-treated total nucleic acids from cells or isolated mitochondria, as described previously (21Micol V. Fernández-Silva P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 3-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following oligodeoxynucleotides, designated according to the numbering system of the Cambridge sequence (26Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijin M.H.L. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Shreier P.H. Smith A.J.H. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7683) Google Scholar), were used for primer extension of DMS-treated DNA in the assay as follows: L315, 5′-CGCTTCTGGCCACAGCAC-3′; L476, 5′-CTAATCTCATCAATACAACC-3′; H495, 5′-GGTTGTATTGATGAGATTAG-3′; and H719, 5′-CTCACTGGAACGGGGATG3′ for the fingerprinting of the initiation region; and L3064, 5′-ATCTGAGTTCAGACCGG-3′; and H3360, 5′-TGCCATTGCGATTAGAATGG3′ for the fingerprinting of the rDNA transcription termination region. The oligodeoxynucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP as detailed previously (21Micol V. Fernández-Silva P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 3-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five μg of DMS-treated and piperidine-cleaved total DNA from cells (containing approximately 0.005 pmol of mtDNA) or 0.2–0.4 μg of similarly treated DNA from the isolated mitochondrial fractions were used as a template for primer extension analysis. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and electrophoresis of the products through 6% polyacrylamide, 7.7 m urea sequencing gels in Tris borate/EDTA buffer were carried out as described previously (21Micol V. Fernández-Silva P. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 3-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of mTERF was determined by mobility shift assays using the double-stranded 44-mer oligodeoxynucleotide probe described previously (11Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A constant amount of mitochondrial lysate protein was incubated with 10 fmol of probe in the presence of the indicated concentrations of ATP, and the samples were then run on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel, as detailed elsewhere (27Fernández-Silva P. Micol V. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 129-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pTER plasmid, used as a template for the transcription termination assays, has been previously described (11Kruse B. Narasimhan N. Attardi G. Cell. 1989; 58: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), as has been the clone BSAND, utilized to synthesize the RNA probe employed in the S1 protection assays (12Daga A. Micol V. Hess D. Aebersold R. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8123-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fernández-Silva P. Micol V. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 129-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription termination reactions and the S1 protection assays were performed as detailed previously (12Daga A. Micol V. Hess D. Aebersold R. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8123-8130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,27Fernández-Silva P. Micol V. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 129-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); quantification of the S1-resistant products was carried out by laser densitometry of the autoradiogram. Mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of [α-32P]UTP in the appropriate buffer, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” It has been previously shown that HeLa cell mitochondria, under these conditions, are able to carry out RNA synthesis in a way closely resembling thein vivo process (6Gaines G. Attardi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 451-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Gaines G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1605-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Gaines G. Rossi C. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1907-1915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, transcription has been shown to start at the two H-strand initiation sites (H1 for the rDNA transcription unit, and H2 for the whole H-strand transcription unit) and at the single L-strand initiation site, and the transcripts have been shown to be processed in a way reproducing the in vivo patterns; however, the relative rates of rRNA synthesis and polyadenylation are somewhat reduced in this in vitro system, as compared with thein vivo situation (7Gaines G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1605-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine the optimum time of DMS treatment for in organello footprinting during mitochondria incubation, time course and time interval pulse-labeling experiments were carried out. Fig.1 a shows the electrophoretic patterns in an agarose-formaldehyde gel of RNA labeled with [α-32P]UTP in isolated HeLa cell mitochondria, in the presence of 1 mmATP, after different times of incubation or after different time interval pulses. Fig. 1, b and c, shows the radioactivity incorporated into total mitochondrial RNA, measured as overall signal from gel-separated RNA bands scanned with a PhosphorImager, in the continuous incorporation and, respectively, time interval pulse-labeling experiments. From Fig. 1 b it appears that the accumulation of label into total mitochondrial RNA proceeds at a fairly constant rate for 30 min at 37 °C. On the other hand, the time interval pulse-labeling experiments, which tend to exclude a possible role in the observed kinetics of changes in RNA turnover rate during in vitro incubation, indicate that the maximum rate of incorporation of radioactivity occurs between 10 and 30 min after the beginning of incubation and suggest a fairly constant rate of incorporation up to 45 min. On the basis of these experiments, DMS treatment for in organello footprinting was carried out 20 min from the start of incubation, and the synthesized RNA was isolated at 30 min. Fig. 2 a shows the in vivo methylation patterns of the H-strand in the L-strand transcription promoter region of HeLa cell and 143B.TK−cell mtDNA and the in organello methylation pattern of the H-strand in the same region of HeLa cell mtDNA (lanes E). By comparing these patterns with those generated by DMS treatment of naked DNA isolated from total cells or mitochondria (lanes N), one recognizes regions of altered reactivity to DMS. In particular, in the region around the L-strand initiation site (at position ∼407), one H-strand residue (nucleotide 409), exhibits hypermethylation in thein vivo footprinting pattern, whereas five H-strand residues (nucleotides 401, 403, 408, 409, and 410) exhibit methylation protection or hypermethylation in the in organellofootprinting pattern. In the region spanning nucleotides 418 to 447 upstream of the L-strand transcription initiation site, which corresponds to the binding site of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (mTFA) (15Fisher R.P. Topper J.N. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), three H-strand residues (nucleotides 427, 437, and 438) (Fig. 2 a) and one L-strand residue (nucleotide 429) (not shown) exhibit methylation protection, and one L-strand residue (nucleotide 443) (not shown) hypermethylation in the in vivofootprinting pattern. In the in organello footprinting pattern, eight H-strand residues (420, 427, 437, 438, 441, 444, 445, 446, and 447) (Fig. 2 a) and two L-strand residues (429 and 443) (not shown) exhibit methylation protection or hypermethylation in the same region. In both the sequence immediately surrounding the L-strand transcription initiation site and in the mTFA binding domain there is a reasonable correspondence between the residues exhibiting protection or hypermethylation in the in vivo and in thein organello footprinting (∼30 and 50% correspondence of residues showing methylation interference in the two regions). Particularly noteworthy is the partial correspondence of hypermethylated nucleotides in vivo and in organello immediately upstream of the L-strand transcription initiation site. Fig. 2 b shows the in vivo methylation patterns of the L-strand in the regions of the H1 and H2 H-strand transcription initiation sites of HeLa cell and 143B.TK− cell mtDNA and the in organello methylation pattern of the L-strand in the same regions of HeLa cell mtDNA. The in vivo and in organello methylation interference patterns in the L-strand of the region of the rRNA-specific H-strand transcription initiation site H1 (at position ∼559) and of the adjacent regions is shown with a greater resolution in Fig. 2 c after a longer electrophoretic run of the same samples used in the experiment of Fig. 2 b. In particular, in the segment immediately surrounding the H1 initiation site, one L-strand residue (nucleotide 560) exhibits a hypermethylation in the in vivo footprinting pattern (Fig. 2, band c); in the in organello footprinting pattern, the same residue exhibits a much stronger hypermethylation (Fig. 2,b and c), whereas one H-strand residue (nucleotide 557) shows methylation protection (not shown). In the mtDNA segment spanning nucleotides 524–546 upstream of the H1transcription initiation site, which corresponds to the mTFA binding site (15Fisher R.P. Topper J.N. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), a single L-strand residue (nucleotide 545) exhibits methylation protection in the in organello footprinting pattern (Fig. 2, b and c). Within the segment between the mTFA binding site and the H1 initiation site, two additional L-strand residues (nucleotides 551 and 552) exhibit hypermethylation in the in organello pattern (Fig. 2,b and c). Furthermore, in the segment immediately downstream of the H1 start site, three L-strand residues (nucleotides 577, 583, and 586) (Fig. 2, b and c) and two H-strand residues (nucleotides 568 and 575) (not shown) exhibit methylation protection in the in organello pattern. The protection or hypermethylation phenomena described above appear to occur at positions of known protein-DNA interactions (like those involving mTFA) or at potential sites of similar interactions (involving RNA polymerase or transcription factor(s)) at or near the RNA synthesis start positions. An additional pattern of altered methylation reactivity was observed in the L-strand in the segment spanning nucleotides 601–621 within the tRNAPhe gene, located about 40 nucleotides downstream of the H1transcription initiation site at position ∼559. This mtDNA segment lies 27 nucleotides upstream of the second H-strand transcription initiation site (H 2 in Fig. 3) near the 5′-end of the 12 S rRNA gene. In particular, two L-strand residues (nucleotides 620 and 621) are hypermethylated in the in vivo footprinting (Fig. 2 b), and three L-strand residues (nucleotides 601, 602, and 611) (Fig. 2 b) and two H-strand residues (nucleotides 602 and 609) (not shown) exhibit altered methylation reactivity in the in organello pattern. Fig. 3summarizes the in organello and in vivomethylation reactivity pattern of the L-strand and H-strand transcription promoter regions.Figure 2In vivo and in organellofootprinting patterns of human mtDNA L-strand (a) and H-strand (b and c) transcription promoter regions. c shows the same samples of b, after a longer electrophoretic run, as well as the primer extension products ofin vivo DMS-treated total DNA from HeLa cells pretreated overnight with 0.125 μm EtBr (H/EtBr). ○,in vivo protected bands; •, in vivohypermethylated bands; □, in organello protected bands; ▪, in organello hypermethylated bands.

Rossi C. Attardi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1907-1915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether ATP had any effect on the in organello footprinting patterns, which could be correlated with changes in transcription, isolated HeLa cell mitochondria were incubated in different concentrations of ATP, ranging from 0 to 10 mm, and DMS treatment was performed 20 min after the beginning of incubation. With due account for some differences in the amount of sample loaded, no significant change in the in organello footprinting pattern corresponding to the H-strand (Fig. 4 a) or L-strand (not shown) of the L-strand promoter was observed in mtDNA from mitochondria incubated in different ATP concentrations. By contrast, a clear-cut ATP-dependent change was detected in the footprinting pattern of the H-strand rDNA-specific promoter. In particular, the hypermethylated L560 band exhibited a marked increase in intensity after addition of ≥0.25 mm ATP to the medium, reaching a maximum between 1 and 5 mm, and declining at higher ATP concentrations (Fig. 4 b). Since the L560 band showed the most evident change in intensity in relationship to ATP concentration, it was utilized as an indicator of modifications in putative protein-DNA interactions in subsequent experiments. It should be noticed that the in organello methylation patterns obtained in the presence of 1 mm ATP for the L-strand of the rDNA-specific H-strand promoter and the H-strand of the L-strand promoter, which are shown in Fig. 4, a and b, are substantially identical to those observed in the independent experiment illustrated in Fig. 2, a and b, indicating the reproducibility of the in organello patterns. Fig. 4 c shows the patterns in a formaldehyde-agarose gel of RNA labeled in isolated HeLa cell mitochondria in the presence of different concentrations of ATP. It is clear that, in the absence of added ATP, the mRNA species are labeled to a substantial extent, whereas there is only marginal labeling of the rRNA species; by contrast, addition of ATP at ≥0.25 mm strongly stimulates rRNA synthesis, which reaches a maximum (including the rRNA precursors) at about 1 mm, with only a moderate increase in mRNA synthesis. Fig. 4 d correlates the ATP-related changes in intensity of the L560 band with the variations of the in organello rate of synthesis of 16 S rRNA and mitochondrial mRNAs (ND5, ND4/4L, COI, Cytb, A6/8, COIII, and COII). It is clear that the changes in level of methylation of the L560 band follow much more closely the modifications in rate of synthesis in organello of rRNA than the changes in mRNA synthesis. It has been previously shown (6Gaines G. Attardi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 451-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that, in isolated HeLa cell mitochondria, intercalat"
https://openalex.org/W2057834319,"The chemical mechanism by which the F1 moiety of ATP synthase hydrolyzes and synthesizes ATP remains unknown. For this reason, we have carried out studies with orthovanadate (Vi), a phosphate analog which has the potential of “locking” an ATPase, in its transition state by forming a MgADP·Vi complex, and also the potential, in a photochemical reaction resulting in peptide bond cleavage, of identifying an amino acid very near the γ-phosphate of ATP. Upon incubating purified rat liver F1 with MgADP and Vi for 2 h to promote formation of a MgADP·Vi-F1 complex, the ATPase activity of the enzyme was markedly inhibited in a reversible manner. When the resultant complex was formed in the presence of ultraviolet light inhibition could not be reversed, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed, in addition to the five known subunit bands characteristic of F1 (i.e. α, β, γ, δ, and ε), two new electrophoretic species of 17 and 34 kDa. Western blot and N-terminal sequencing analyses identified both bands as arising from the β subunit with the site of peptide bond cleavage occurring at alanine 158, a conserved residue within F1-ATPases and the third residue within the nucleotide binding consensus GX 4GK(T/S) (P-loop). Quantification of the amount of ADP bound within the MgADP·Vi-F1 complex revealed about 1.0 mol/mol F1, while quantification of the peptide cleavage products revealed that no more than one β subunit had been cleaved. Consistent with the cleavage reaction involving oxidation of the methyl group of alanine was the finding that [3H] from NaB[3H]4 incorporates into MgADP·Vi-F1 complex following treatment with ultraviolet light. These novel findings provide information about the transition state involved in the hydrolysis of ATP by a single β subunit within F1-ATPases and implicate alanine 158 as residing very near the γ-phosphate of ATP during catalysis. When considered with earlier studies on myosin and adenylate kinase, these studies also implicate a special role for the third residue within the GX 4GK(T/S) sequence of many other nucleotide-binding proteins.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7982-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These studies strongly implicated this serine as contacting directly the γ-phosphate of ATP in the transition state, and were recently confirmed by x-ray structural analysis (10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The reaction pathway of F1-ATPase is believed to be quite similar to that of myosin-ATPase (11Cross R.L. Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12101-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, within the catalytic sites of both enzymes resides the nucleotide binding consensus GX 4GKT (P-loop) (12Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.H. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar), which in the β-subunit of F1 (GGAGVGKT), contains alanine in place of the internal Vi-sensitive serine characteristic of the myosin consensus (GESGAGKT). As this serine in myosin is known to contact the γ-phosphate of ATP in the transition state (10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), it seemed reasonable to assume that in F1 a nearby serine residing outside the consensus region or the terminal threonine within the consensus region may serve this role in the transition state. Alternatively, the third position within the consensus region of F1, although containing an alanine, may play an important role in the transition state of F1 as does the serine in the same position in myosin. Studies described below were carried out both to define optimal conditions for trapping F1-ATPase in a MgADP·Vi-F1 inhibitory transition state complex, and to establish in this state the identity of an amino acid residue near the γ-phosphate of ATP. Both goals were accomplished and provide novel insights into the chemical mechanism of ATP synthases. Rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, white males) were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories. ATP, ADP, MgCl2, MOPS, CAPS, sodium orthovanadate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and lactic dehydrogenase were obtained from Sigma. SDS, acrylamide, and bisacrylamide were from Bio-Rad. Ammonium sulfate and potassium phosphate were from J. T. Baker Chemical Co. Tuberculin syringes and Sephadex G-50 used in nucleotide binding assays were from Becton-Dickinson Co. and Pharmacia Biotech Inc., respectively. PVDF membranes were obtained from Millipore and Western blot reagents from Amersham. A polyclonal antibody against the rat F1β-subunit was raised in rabbits using the synthetic peptide KIGLFGGAGVGKCT. [3H]ADP and NaB[3H]4 were from NEN Life Science Products. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. The enzyme was purified by the procedure of Catterall and Pedersen (13Catterall W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4987-4994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the modification described by Pedersen et al. (14Pedersen P.L. Hullihen J. Wehrle J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1362-1369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified enzyme, in 250 mm KPi and 5.0 mmEDTA, was divided into 100-μl aliquots, lyophilized to dryness, and stored at −20 °C. Prior to use, aliquots (150–250 μg) of lyophilized F1 were dissolved at 25 °C in 100 μl of water and precipitated twice with 3 m ammonium sulfate, 5 mm EDTA, redissolving between precipitations in 200 mm K2SO4, 10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, or 50 mm MOPS, pH 8.0. To minimize the presence of polymeric species the following protocol was followed: Na3VO4 powder was dissolved in water and the pH adjusted with HCl to pH 10 (orange color). The solution was boiled for 2 min at which time the solution became clear. The pH was readjusted to pH 10 and the previous boiling repeated 2 times. After the optical density was determined at 265 nm, the Viconcentration was calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of 2925 m−1 cm−1. The stock solutions used in this study were 155 mm and were covered with aluminum foil and stored until use at −80 °C. F1 (50 μg) was priorly incubated in a 100- or 200-μl system containing 50 mm MOPS, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol (v/v) and, where indicated, also Vi, Vi + ADP, Vi + ADP + MgCl2, Vi + ATP + MgCl2, or MgCl2, all at concentrations indicated in legends. Prior incubations were carried out at 25 °C for the indicated times. In experiments where photoactivation of vanadate was induced with uv light (320 nm), the incubation mixture in an open Eppendorf tube was placed under a 100 watt, long wavelength mercury spot lamp (BLAK-RAY (Model B 100A, 115 V, 2.5 amperes; San Gabriel, CA) at a distance of 7.8 cm. The time in the presence of the light source varied as indicated in the figure legends. The spectrophotometric procedure was used in which ADP formed was coupled to the pyruvate kinase and lactic dehydrogenase reactions (13Catterall W.A. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4987-4994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained the following in a volume of 1 ml at pH 7.5 and 25 °C: 0.2 mm ATP, 65 mm Tris-Cl, 4.8 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm KPi, 0.40 mm NADH, 0.60 mm phosphoenolpyruvic acid, 5 mm KCN, 1 unit of lactic dehydrogenase, 1 unit of pyruvate kinase, and 1.5 μg of F1. Binding assays were carried out at 25 °C by incubating F1, or fractions derived therefrom, for 20 min in a final volume of 100 μl, containing concentrations of F1, [3H]ADP, MgCl2, Vi, and buffer as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. The entire reaction mixture was loaded onto a Sephadex G-50 “fine” column (1-cm3 tuberculin syringe with a filter at the bottom), which had been pre-equilibrated with 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.6, and priorly centrifuged for 1.5 min at 2,500 rpm in an IEC model HN-SII clinical centrifuge. Centrifugation of the reaction mixture was carried out for 1.5 min at 2,500 rpm to separate nucleotide bound to F1 from free nucleotide (15Williams N. Hullihen J.M. Pedersen P.L.

The diluted solution was filtered through Amicon's Microcon 100 Filtration Unit at 25 °C by centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 min. The filtrate was discarded and the retentate was diluted to 0.1 ml and assayed for F1-ATPase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures” (right panels, Cycle 1). The dilution, washing, assay procedures were then repeated (right panels, Cycle 2).

Where indicated, densitometric analysis of the Coomassie-stained bands was carried out using a Fujifilm Bas-1500 PhosphorImager and MacBas (V 2.31) software. After conducting SDS-PAGE, the proteins on the gel were transferred electrophoretically onto a PVDF membrane (1 h at 100 volts and 0.2 amp at 4 °C in 10 mmCAPS, 10% methanol transfer buffer, pH 11). The product was then blocked for 1 h with 2% bovine serum albumin plus 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T (80 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5), incubated for 1 h at 23 °C with a rat liver F1-β subunit polyclonal antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”), and then further incubated for 1 h at 23 °C with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG). The immunoreactive bands were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescene (ECL) system of Amersham Life Sciences. F1 β-subunit peptide fragments were transferred from SDS-PAGE gels onto PVDF membranes by electroblotting. Transfer conditions were for 1 h in 10 mm CAPS buffer, 10% methanol, pH 11, at 4 °C in the case of the 17-kDa F1-β subunit fragment, and 2 h in the same buffer at 25 °C in the case of the 34-kDa fragment. Only under the latter conditions could an N-terminal sequence be obtained with the 34-kDa fragment. The peptides were then excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing (19Edman P. Acta. Chem. Scand. 1950; 4: 283-293Crossref Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems 475A Protein Sequencing System (20Hunkapillar M.W. Hood L.E. Science. 1983; 219: 650-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after first precipitating with 5% trichloroacetic acid. To promote formation of an inhibitory MgADP·Vi-F1 transition state complex, several precautions were taken. First, the Vistock solution was priorly treated exactly as described under “Experimental Procedures” and maintained at pH 10 in the dark at −80 °C until use to prevent formation of polymeric species. Second, the zwitterionic buffer MOPS was used in all experiments as it both stabilizes F1 and prevents or minimizes inhibition by MgCl2 and the product MgADP (or ADP). Third, a pH of 8.5 was used in all experiments, as this pH is near optimal for the hydrolysis of ATP catalyzed by rat liver F1. Finally, equimolar amounts of MgCl2, ADP, and Vi were used to promote formation of MgADP·Vi at the active site of F1. Fig. 2 A summarizes results of an experiment where F1 was priorly incubated in the presence of 200 μm each of MgCl2, ADP, and Vi for the indicated times and then assayed for ATPase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Here it is clear that under these conditions, which are optimal for forming a MgADP·Vi-F1 transition state complex, F1-ATPase activity is markedly inhibited. Half-maximal inhibition is reached in about 45 min, and maximal inhibition (∼80%) is reached in about 2 h. In control experiments with F1 alone, F1 + Vi, F1 + ADP, and F1 + MgADP, inhibition at 2 h is, respectively, <1, 10, 20, and 20% under conditions described in the figure legend. In an experiment not presented, F1 prior incubated with MgCl2 alone, was not inhibited after 2 h. Finally, Fig. 2 B shows that when F1 is prior incubated with 200 μm each of MgCl2, ADP, and Vi, but in the presence of light (320 nm) and atmospheric oxygen, an essentially identical inhibition profile is observed. If formation of a MgADP·Vi-F1 transition state complex is responsible for the inhibition observed in the presence of MgCl2 + ADP + Vi, this state should be reversible. Results presented in Fig. 3 A show that this is the case. Thus, following maximal inhibition of F1-ATPase activity in the presence of 200 μm each of MgCl2, ADP, and VI (Fig. 3 A, left panel), an aliquot was removed and subjected to two dilution/wash cycles in the presence of 50 mm MOPS, 10% glycerol, pH 8.5. This resulted after two such cycles in the restoration of the original activity to a level near 90% (Fig. 3 A, right panel). Significantly, reversal of ATPase activity could not be achieved (Fig. 3 B, right panel) following inhibition of F1-ATPase activity under identical conditions but in the presence of uv light (Fig. 3 B, left panel) and with longer incubation times. The reason for this becomes clear in the description of other experiments described below. It is expected that if a MgADP·Vi-F1 transition state is formed in the presence of MgCl2, ADP, and Vi as implicated from the above studies, it would be formed also under turnover conditions, i.e. when ATP, the substrate for ATP hydrolysis is present. For this reason, F1 was incubated exactly as described above but with ATP replacing ADP in the prior incubation mixture. Thus, the final prior incubation mixture contained 200 μm each of MgCl2, ATP, and Vi. After 1 h under these turnover conditions, aliquots were removed and assayed for ATPase activity. Results presented in Fig. 4 show that F1-ATPase activity is inhibited about 50% in the absence of uv light and about 70% in its presence. Although after 1 h the degree of inhibition is not as great as that achieved when prior incubation is carried out with ADP rather than ATP in the prior incubation mixture, this is to be expected. Thus, under the latter conditions ATP must first undergo hydrolysis before ADP is available for formation of the MgADP·Vi-F1 complex and MgATP competes with ADP for binding to F1-ATPase active sites. As indicated earlier, vanadate is photoreactive and has been shown in the case of the MgADP·Vi-myosin complex to modify an active site serine residue within contact distance of Vi and, in the presence of light and atmospheric oxygen, to induce peptide bond cleavage at this site (8Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6608-6611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cremo C.R. Long G.T. Grammer J.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7982-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). For this reason F1 was priorly incubated in the presence of 200 μm each of MgCl2, ADP, and Vi in the absence and presence of uv light exactly as described for Figs. 2 and3 and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. When the resultant SDS-PAGE profiles (Fig. 5, A and B) of the two incubation mixtures (absence and presence of light) are compared, it is clear that only in the latter case has polypeptide bond cleavage occurred. Thus, in addition to Coomassie-stained bands corresponding to the known F1 subunits α, β, γ, δ, and ε, bands distinct from these subunits with apparent molecular masses of 17 and 34 kDa appear (Fig. 5 B, lane 6). Polypeptide bond cleavage within the F1 molecule is highly specific, and is not observed in the absence of uv light under any condition tested (Fig.5 A), and is observed in the presence of uv light with MgCl2 + ADP + Vi (Fig. 5 B, lane 6). Fig. 5 C shows that the appearance of the 17- and 34-kDa peptide fragments increases with time as expected and levels off after about 2 h (lane 9). These findings are consistent with polypeptide bond cleavage within the nucleotide-binding consensus region (GGAGVGKT) of the 51.5-kDa β-subunit, as this would give rise to two fragments with molecular masses near the experimentally determined values of the 17- and 34-kDa bands (Fig. 5 C). Results of native PAGE experiments presented in Fig. 6 A, lanes 1–5, show that, under conditions which result in cleavage of a polypeptide chain within the MgADP·Vi-F1 complex in the presence of uv light and atmospheric oxygen, the oligomeric state of the F1 molecule remains intact. In fact, the F1molecule remains intact in uv light under all conditions tested (i.e. alone or with Vi, MgCl2 + ADP, ADP + Vi, or MgCl2 + ADP + Vi; Fig.6 A, lanes 1–5, respectively). Specifically, as it applies to the uv light and Vi-dependent cleavage of a polypeptide chain within the MgADP·Vi-F1 complex (Fig.5 B, lane 6), these results are consistent with a very localized reaction which is otherwise without deleterious effect on the remaining part of the F1 molecule. Identification of the β or “catalytic” subunit within F1 as the source of the 17- and 34-kDa bands was derived from two separate experiments. In the first, SDS-PAGE gels of the uv light-treated MgADPVi·F1 complex, after transfer to PVDF membranes, were probed with a polyclonal, antibody raised against the synthetic peptide KIGLFGGAGVGKCT, containing the GX 4GKT consensus region of the rat liver β subunit. As shown in Fig. 6 B, lane 6, only the intact β subunit and the 17-kDa band cross-react with the antibody. This is the expected result if polypeptide bond cleavage occurs within the nucleotide binding consensus region of the β subunit, as the epitope reactive with the antibody would be largely retained at the C terminus of the 17-kDa fragment, but missing from the 34-kDa fragment. In the second experiment, N-terminal sequence analysis (Fig. 6 C) which identified the 7-amino acid stretch APKAGTA confirmed the β subunit (Fig. 1 B) as the origin of the 17-kDa fragment. (The first six amino acids at the N terminus of the rat liver β subunit predicted from c-DNA cloning (Fig. 1 B) are not present in the isolated protein.) N-terminal sequence analysis of the 34-kDa fragment also proved possible by carrying out the transfer from SDS-PAGE to PVDF membranes for 2 rather than 1 h, and at 25 °C rather than 4 °C (see “Experimental Procedures”). This modification in the transfer procedure was done to promote removal of an oxalyl group (HO-CO-CO-) predicted to be at the N terminus of the 34-kDa fragment following the Vi-dependent cleavage reaction (Fig.1 A). Significantly, the N-terminal sequence obtained, GVGKTVLIMELINN (Fig. 6 D), not only confirmed the 34-kDa fragment as being derived from the β subunit, but placed the site of cleavage at alanine 158 within the GGAGVGKT consensus region. To determine the extent of involvement of the 3 β subunits of F1 in the formation of the MgADP·Vi-F1 transition state complex, and in the formation of the 17- and 34-kDa cleavage products, both ADP-binding studies and densitometric analysis of Coomassie-stained bands were carried out. Fig. 6 E shows that under the conditions used in this study, rat liver F1 binds only about 1 mol of ADP/mol of F1 and that Viand MgCl2 have little or no affect on this stoichiometric ratio. When MgCl2, ADP, and Vi are added together, each at a concentration of 200 μm to favor formation of the MgADP·Vi-F1 complex (Fig.2 A), the stoichiometry of ADP binding remains constant. Thus, formation of the transition state complex appears to be restricted predominantly to the involvement of 1 β subunit. This correlates well with the estimated number of β subunits involved in formation of the 17- and 34-kDa cleavage products when the transition state complex is formed in the presence of uv light. Here, a loss of 33% of the total F1 β subunit staining intensity results which is fully recovered by the sum of the staining intensities of the 17- and 34-kDa products (Fig. 6 F). Studies described above provide rather compelling evidence that, in the presence of atmospheric oxygen, uv light-induced cleavage of a single β subunit within the MgADP·Vi-F1 complex occurs at alanine 158. If the β-methyl group of this alanine residue is oxidized, it is expected to proceed through a series of reactions resulting first in the formation of serine, then an aldehyde (Fig.7 A), and finally other intermediates before peptide bond cleavage finally occurs (see Fig. 1 A and Refs.22Coulston G.W. Bare S.R. Kung K.B. Bethke G.K. Harlow R. Herron N. Lee P.L. Science. 1997; 275: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar and 27Grammer J. Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Cremo C.R. Yount R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15582-15592Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, it should be possible, via reduction of the aldehyde, to demonstrate a uv light-dependent incorporation of tritium [3H] from 3H-labeled sodium borohydride into F1-ATPase following the enzyme's inactivation by MgADP·Vi. Results presented in Fig.7 B show that such an incorporation does occur in very significant amounts over control levels obtained in the absence of MgADP·Vi. Incorporation reaches a maximal level in about 7 min, and then declines as expected because the aldehyde is a transient intermediate in the overall oxidation process. Studies reported here strongly implicate alanine 158 in the third position of the GGAGVGKT consensus of the rat liver F1 β-subunit as residing very near the γ-phosphate group of ATP in the transition state. Significantly, alanine in this position is conserved in all F1-ATPases (23Ysern X. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1988; 20: 423-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and in Escherichia coli, F1 mutations in this position to valine or proline result, respectively, in a >90% loss or a 2-fold activation of catalytic activity (24Takeyama M. Ihara K. Moriyama Y. Noumi T. Ida K. Tomioka N. Itai A. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21279-21284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the comparable “third position” residue, serine 181, inDictyostelium myosin subfragment 1, has been shown to be within contact distance (2.6 Å) of the Vi oxygen atoms in the x-ray structure of the MgADP·Vi-myosin S1 complex (10Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). With these facts, and the extensive data presented in this paper in mind, a tentative pathway for ATP hydrolysis at the active site of F1 is proposed. Here, formation of the transition state (Fig. 8 A, center panel) from the pre-ATP hydrolysis state (Fig. 8 A, left panel) is considered to align the Cβ atom of alanine in close proximity to the γ-phosphorus atom of ATP. In the proposed trigonal bipyramidal transition state complex, the planar γ-phosphorus atom, a water molecule, and a potential catalytic base, “B,” are considered to be sufficiently close to facilitate ATP hydrolysis. As only one of the three β subunits forms a transition state complex in the presence of MgADP·Vi (Fig. 6, E and F), and F1 is believed to function by involving sequential participation of the β subunits in catalysis via γ,β-subunit interactions (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar), it is not unreasonable to suggest also that these interactions may help stabilize the transition state. The mechanistic role of the third position serine in the GX 4GK(T/S) sequence in myosin (8Cremo C.R. Grammer J.C. Yount R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6608-6611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cremo C.R. Long G.T. Grammer J.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7982-7990Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) involves a much greater capacity to form hydrogen bonds to the oxygen of the γ-phosphate of ATP than does the alanine in the same position in F1-ATPase. Therefore, the third position serine in myosin may play a different role in the mechanism of this enzyme than does the third position alanine in F1-ATPases. Nevertheless, in both cases, this third position residue may also be critical in determining the polarity, size, and/or rate of formation of the binding pocket in which the γ-phosphate group of ATP is contained in the transition state. Significantly, differences in these parameters among different ATP-dependent enzymes may help “set” the catalytic rate at a value most compatible with an enzyme's physiological role, while determining in part substrate specificity (see also Refs. 24Takeyama M.

Kishi F. Nakazawa A. Fukui T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 990-995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Along these lines, it is interesting to note that Vi in the presence of uv light and oxygen also cleaves adenylate kinase at the third position (proline 17) within the nucleotide binding consensus GGPGSGKGT (26Cremo C.R. Loo J.A. Edmonds C.G. Hatlelid K.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, in support of the view proposed here, three different enzymes, myosin, F1-ATPase, and adenylate kinase are all cleaved at the same third position despite the fact that the amino acid occupying this position is very different in all cases (Fig. 8 B), but conserved within its specific enzyme class. Finally, it should be noted that results presented here, which have focused on alanine 158 of rat liver F1, do not preclude other amino acids near the γ-phosphate of ATP in the transition state. Significantly, in a recent intriguing paper Senior and colleagues (28Lobau S. Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3648-3656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have summarized the possible roles of three catalytic site residues in the E. coli F1-ATPase. One of these, lysine 155 (lysine 162 in rat liver F1) is considered to be involved in the major functional interaction with the γ-phosphate of MgATP in the substrate bound or “ground state,” but to undergo conformational repositioning during catalysis. Therefore, when taken together with the novel findings from studies reported here, it will be of considerable interest to visualize the precise location and orientation of lysine 162 and alanine 158 in the transition state when the x-ray structure of the MgADP·Vi-F1 complex is elucidated. We are grateful to Dr. Albert Mildvan with whom we had many discussions about this work, Joanne Hullihen for technical assistance, and Jackie Seidl for processing the manuscript for publication."

FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); and (d) stable expression of phospholamban in C2C12 cells, a fast-twitch skeletal muscle cell line that expresses SERCA1, resulted in an inhibition of SERCA1 activity in its native SR environment (16Harrer J.M. Ponniah S. Ferguson D.G. Kranias E.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 146: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).While evidence obtained in these in vitro studies suggests that phospholamban can regulate the SERCA1 enzyme, it is not presently clear whether this regulation would lead to alterations of skeletal muscle kinetics. The advent of transgenesis allows for tissue-specific expression of a protein of interest and assessment of its physiological consequences in that particular tissue. Thus, transgenic mice provide ideal systems for testing phospholamban-mediated regulation of SERCA1 activity in vivo and its effects on fast-twitch skeletal muscle function. In this study, we generated a transgenic mouse model, which ectopically expresses phospholamban exclusively in fast-twitch skeletal muscle under the control of the rat myosin light chain 1f (MLC1f) promoter and enhancer elements. Introduction of phospholamban into fast-twitch skeletal muscle resulted in inhibition of SERCA1 activity in its native lipid environment and in alterations in muscle relaxation kinetics.DISCUSSIONThis study presents the first evidence that SERCA1 activity can be regulated by phospholamban in vivo, resulting in depressed rates of fast-twitch skeletal muscle relaxation. A transgenic mouse model was generated, which ectopically expressed phospholamban exclusively in fast-twitch skeletal muscle under the control of the rat myosin light chain 1f promoter and enhancer elements. Indirect immunofluorescence labeling of phospholamban and SR Ca2+-ATPase in transgenic gastrocnemius tissues indicated that the two proteins were co-distributed, suggesting that the transgenic phospholamban was incorporated into the SR membranes. This ectopic phospholamban expression was associated with decreases in the affinity of the SR Ca2+ pump for Ca2+, in agreement with previous studies involving phospholipid bilayer reconstitution (9Kim H.W.

Biochem. 1995; 146: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) of phospholamban and SERCA1. Although we cannot presently exclude the possibility that modulation of SR Ca2+ uptake activity occurs through the formation of Ca2+-selective phospholamban channels (37Kovacs R.J. Nelson M.T. Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18364-18368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our findings indicate that the affinity of the SR transport system for calcium was altered without any effects on its maximal velocity.The generation of this ectopic expression model allowed us to extend our previous studies on phospholamban-mediated regulation of SERCA1 activity in vitro (9Kim H.W. Steenaart N.A.E. Ferguson D.G. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1702-1709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Harrer J.M. Ponniah S. Ferguson D.G. Kranias E.G. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1992; 114: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and to examine the functional implications of this modulation in the intact muscle. The inhibitory effects of phospholamban expression on SR Ca2+ uptake reflected alterations in the contractile properties of isolated fast-twitch skeletal muscles. Examination of isometric twitch dynamics of transgenic EDL muscles revealed a prolongation in the half-relaxation time, without alterations in the contraction time, as compared with the wild-type EDL muscles. The observed changes in relaxation rates were not due to a reduction in SR Ca2+-ATPase expression levels, since theV max of the Ca2+-ATPase activity was similar in transgenic and nontransgenic muscles. Furthermore, the decreases in the rates of relaxation appeared to correlate with the levels of phospholamban expressed in the transgenic fast-twitch skeletal muscles. However, it is not currently known whether the observed physiological alterations were only due to phospholamban expression or whether an unknown compensatory response also occurred in the transgenic mice, which led to an increase in passive muscle stiffness.Since the inhibitory effects of phospholamban in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscles can be relieved during β-adrenergic stimulation (11Lindemann J.P. Jones L.R. Hathaway D.R. Henry B.G. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 464-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W.N. Walsh R.A.

J. 1985; 226: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we exposed the wild-type and transgenic EDL muscles to cumulative doses of isoproterenol, a mixed β-adrenergic agonist. Isoproterenol stimulated force production by 30% but had no effect on either the contraction or half-relaxation times in wild-type EDL muscles, in agreement with previous findings (38Bowman W. Szekeres L. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 54. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1980: 47-128Google Scholar). The observed stimulation of force production by isoproterenol in this study may be due to cAMP-dependent and/or Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of key calcium-handling proteins such as the sarcolemmal calcium channel (39Rotman E.I. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16371-16377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the ryanodine receptor (40Suko J. Maurer-Fogy I. Plank B.

Biochem. 1995; 142: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). While the functional implications of these phosphorylations is currently unclear, it is possible that isoproterenol stimulation may alter the activities of these proteins, thereby increasing the cytosolic calcium available for contraction and leading to enhanced force production. In the transgenic EDL muscles, isoproterenol stimulation was also associated with a 30% increase in developed force and had no effect on the contraction or half-relaxation times, consistent with its effects in the wild-type EDL muscles. Thus, isoproterenol could not reverse the prolonged half-relaxation time associated with phospholamban expression in this muscle. These findings in fast-twitch skeletal muscle appear to be in contrast with our recent observations in the murine soleus, which suggested that phospholamban was a key modulator of the effects of isoproterenol on the half-relaxation time of mouse slow-twitch skeletal muscle (27Slack, J. P., Grupp, I. L., Luo, W., and Kranias, E. G. (1997)Am. J. Physiol., in press.Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that the failure of isoproterenol to reverse the inhibitory effects of phospholamban might be due to the lack of phospholamban phosphorylation in the transgenic muscles. Actually, previous studies in rat cardiomyocytes suggested that phosphorylation of phospholamban may occur during β1- but not β2-adrenergic receptor activation (36Hoffman B.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Gilman A.G. Rall T.W. Nies A.S. Taylor P. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacologic Basis of Therapeutics. 8th Ed. Pergammon Press, Inc., New York1990: 187-220Google Scholar). To determine which receptor subtype mediates the effects of isoproterenol in the EDL muscle, we used specific β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Our results indicate that the effects of isoproterenol in mouse fast-twitch skeletal muscle are mediated via the β2-adrenergic receptor cascade. In addition, Western blot analysis of transgenic muscles, using antibodies that specifically recognize phosphoserine-16 or phosphothreonine-17 residues in phospholamban (24Drago G.A. Colyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25073-25077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Drago G.A. Colyer J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 2345: 15SCrossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), revealed that isoproterenol stimulation was not associated with any detectable phosphorylation of phospholamban. Together, these findings suggest that the effects of isoproterenol in mouse fast-twitch skeletal muscle occur through activation of β2-adrenergic receptors, which are not coupled to phospholamban phosphorylation. These results in fast-twitch skeletal muscle are consistent with those of Xiao et al.(35Xiao R.-P. Hohl C. Altschuld R. Jones L. Livingston B. Ziman B. Tantini B. Lakatta E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19151-19156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that specific activation of β2-adrenergic receptors in rat cardiac myocytes was not associated with changes in Ca2+ dynamics, contractility, and phospholamban phosphorylation.In summary, our findings indicate that the fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoform of the SR Ca2+-ATPase may be regulated by phospholamban in vivo and is associated with significant decreases in the rate of relaxation of transgenic muscles. Thus, induction of phospholamban expression in fast-twitch skeletal muscle would result in some functional alterations resembling its slow-twitch counterpart and therefore compromise the physiological responsiveness of fast-twitch fibers especially in “fight or flight” situations. Future studies designed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in dictating tissue-specific expression of phospholamban may identify the factors/elements missing in fast-twitch skeletal muscle, which prevent expression of this important regulatory protein in vivo.

Maruyama K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); and (d) stable expression of phospholamban in C2C12 cells, a fast-twitch skeletal muscle cell line that expresses SERCA1, resulted in an inhibition of SERCA1 activity in its native SR environment (16Harrer J.M. Ponniah S. Ferguson D.G. Kranias E.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 146: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). While evidence obtained in these in vitro studies suggests that phospholamban can regulate the SERCA1 enzyme, it is not presently clear whether this regulation would lead to alterations of skeletal muscle kinetics. The advent of transgenesis allows for tissue-specific expression of a protein of interest and assessment of its physiological consequences in that particular tissue. Thus, transgenic mice provide ideal systems for testing phospholamban-mediated regulation of SERCA1 activity in vivo and its effects on fast-twitch skeletal muscle function. In this study, we generated a transgenic mouse model, which ectopically expresses phospholamban exclusively in fast-twitch skeletal muscle under the control of the rat myosin light chain 1f (MLC1f) promoter and enhancer elements. Introduction of phospholamban into fast-twitch skeletal muscle resulted in inhibition of SERCA1 activity in its native lipid environment and in alterations in muscle relaxation kinetics. DISCUSSIONThis study presents the first evidence that SERCA1 activity can be regulated by phospholamban in vivo, resulting in depressed rates of fast-twitch skeletal muscle relaxation. A transgenic mouse model was generated, which ectopically expressed phospholamban exclusively in fast-twitch skeletal muscle under the control of the rat myosin light chain 1f promoter and enhancer elements. Indirect immunofluorescence labeling of phospholamban and SR Ca2+-ATPase in transgenic gastrocnemius tissues indicated that the two proteins were co-distributed, suggesting that the transgenic phospholamban was incorporated into the SR membranes. This ectopic phospholamban expression was associated with decreases in the affinity of the SR Ca2+ pump for Ca2+, in agreement with previous studies involving phospholipid bilayer reconstitution (9Kim H.W.

Although we cannot presently exclude the possibility that modulation of SR Ca2+ uptake activity occurs through the formation of Ca2+-selective phospholamban channels (37Kovacs R.J. Nelson M.T.

Chem. 1988; 263: 18364-18368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our findings indicate that the affinity of the SR transport system for calcium was altered without any effects on its maximal velocity.The generation of this ectopic expression model allowed us to extend our previous studies on phospholamban-mediated regulation of SERCA1 activity in vitro (9Kim H.W.

The inhibitory effects of phospholamban expression on SR Ca2+ uptake reflected alterations in the contractile properties of isolated fast-twitch skeletal muscles. Examination of isometric twitch dynamics of transgenic EDL muscles revealed a prolongation in the half-relaxation time, without alterations in the contraction time, as compared with the wild-type EDL muscles. The observed changes in relaxation rates were not due to a reduction in SR Ca2+-ATPase expression levels, since theV max of the Ca2+-ATPase activity was similar in transgenic and nontransgenic muscles. Furthermore, the decreases in the rates of relaxation appeared to correlate with the levels of phospholamban expressed in the transgenic fast-twitch skeletal muscles. However, it is not currently known whether the observed physiological alterations were only due to phospholamban expression or whether an unknown compensatory response also occurred in the transgenic mice, which led to an increase in passive muscle stiffness.Since the inhibitory effects of phospholamban in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscles can be relieved during β-adrenergic stimulation (11Lindemann J.P.

Isoproterenol stimulated force production by 30% but had no effect on either the contraction or half-relaxation times in wild-type EDL muscles, in agreement with previous findings (38Bowman W. Szekeres L. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 54. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1980: 47-128Google Scholar). The observed stimulation of force production by isoproterenol in this study may be due to cAMP-dependent and/or Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of key calcium-handling proteins such as the sarcolemmal calcium channel (39Rotman E.I. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16371-16377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the ryanodine receptor (40Suko J. Maurer-Fogy I. Plank B.

Biochem. 1995; 142: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). While the functional implications of these phosphorylations is currently unclear, it is possible that isoproterenol stimulation may alter the activities of these proteins, thereby increasing the cytosolic calcium available for contraction and leading to enhanced force production. In the transgenic EDL muscles, isoproterenol stimulation was also associated with a 30% increase in developed force and had no effect on the contraction or half-relaxation times, consistent with its effects in the wild-type EDL muscles. Thus, isoproterenol could not reverse the prolonged half-relaxation time associated with phospholamban expression in this muscle. These findings in fast-twitch skeletal muscle appear to be in contrast with our recent observations in the murine soleus, which suggested that phospholamban was a key modulator of the effects of isoproterenol on the half-relaxation time of mouse slow-twitch skeletal muscle (27Slack, J. P., Grupp, I. L., Luo, W., and Kranias, E. G. (1997)Am. J. Physiol., in press.Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that the failure of isoproterenol to reverse the inhibitory effects of phospholamban might be due to the lack of phospholamban phosphorylation in the transgenic muscles. Actually, previous studies in rat cardiomyocytes suggested that phosphorylation of phospholamban may occur during β1- but not β2-adrenergic receptor activation (36Hoffman B.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Gilman A.G. Rall T.W. Nies A.S. Taylor P. Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacologic Basis of Therapeutics. 8th Ed. Pergammon Press, Inc., New York1990: 187-220Google Scholar). To determine which receptor subtype mediates the effects of isoproterenol in the EDL muscle, we used specific β1- and β2-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Our results indicate that the effects of isoproterenol in mouse fast-twitch skeletal muscle are mediated via the β2-adrenergic receptor cascade. In addition, Western blot analysis of transgenic muscles, using antibodies that specifically recognize phosphoserine-16 or phosphothreonine-17 residues in phospholamban (24Drago G.A. Colyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25073-25077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Drago G.A. Colyer J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 2345: 15SCrossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar), revealed that isoproterenol stimulation was not associated with any detectable phosphorylation of phospholamban. Together, these findings suggest that the effects of isoproterenol in mouse fast-twitch skeletal muscle occur through activation of β2-adrenergic receptors, which are not coupled to phospholamban phosphorylation. These results in fast-twitch skeletal muscle are consistent with those of Xiao et al.(35Xiao R.-P. Hohl C. Altschuld R. Jones L. Livingston B. Ziman B. Tantini B. Lakatta E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19151-19156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that specific activation of β2-adrenergic receptors in rat cardiac myocytes was not associated with changes in Ca2+ dynamics, contractility, and phospholamban phosphorylation.In summary, our findings indicate that the fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoform of the SR Ca2+-ATPase may be regulated by phospholamban in vivo and is associated with significant decreases in the rate of relaxation of transgenic muscles. Thus, induction of phospholamban expression in fast-twitch skeletal muscle would result in some functional alterations resembling its slow-twitch counterpart and therefore compromise the physiological responsiveness of fast-twitch fibers especially in “fight or flight” situations. Future studies designed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in dictating tissue-specific expression of phospholamban may identify the factors/elements missing in fast-twitch skeletal muscle, which prevent expression of this important regulatory protein in vivo. This study presents the first evidence that SERCA1 activity can be regulated by phospholamban in vivo, resulting in depressed rates of fast-twitch skeletal muscle relaxation.

From these data the native molecular mass was calculated to be 110 kDa, indicating that the active enzyme is a monomer. The DNA-unwinding and ATP hydrolysis activities associated with DNA helicase I have been examined. One notable property of the enzyme was its relatively high rate of ATP turnover (35–50 molecules of ATP hydrolyzed/s/enzyme molecule) that may contribute to its inefficient unwinding activity at low concentrations of ATP (<0.2 mm). Addition of an ATP-regenerating system to the reaction mixture restored the DNA-unwinding activity of the enzyme.

These observations suggest that the stimulation of DNA unwinding by SpRPA is not simply a result of suppression of nonproductive ATP hydrolysis.

For this purpose, DNA helicases catalyze a DNA strand separation reaction by breaking hydrogen bonds that hold the DNA strands together. DNA helicases use energy derived from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates for bond breakage and translocation of the enzyme along the DNA duplex.

The precise in vivo roles of specific helicases are only well understood when both genetic and biochemical approaches are available. The most well characterized helicases are prokaryotic and eukaryotic viral replicative helicases, including DnaB (14LeBowitz J. McMacken R. J. Biol.

In addition, several gene products involved in nucleotide excision repair and basal transcription in mammalian cells have been shown to be DNA helicases (ERCC2 and ERCC3, two essential subunits of transcription factor TFIIH) (24Schaeffer L.

Prakash S. Nature. 1994; 369: 568-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar).A common feature of the well characterized helicases is that each is a critical component of a multiprotein complex and thus, requires distinct protein-protein interactions to carry out its specific function. For example, the DNA helicase RuvB, in concert with another protein RuvA, is involved in branch migration of DNA crossovers. RuvA provides DNA binding specificity for RuvB by guiding it to Holliday junctions and is required for activation of RuvB helicase activity (26Hiom K. West S.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 787-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Another example is the DnaB protein, the replicative helicase from E. coli. DnaB interacts with the τ subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme and coordinates the helicase activity of DnaB with other proteins engaged in replication fork movement (27Kim S. Dallmann G.

Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).In previous studies, we described the isolation of two DNA helicases from human cells that were markedly stimulated by human SSB (also known as human RPA) (29Seo Y.-S.

Human RPA is a heterotrimeric single-stranded DNA-binding protein and was first characterized as an essential component of the cell-free SV40 DNA replication system (31Wobbe C.R. Weissback L.

In addition, several in vitro studies demonstrated that RPA interacts directly with protein components involved in DNA replication (35Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J.

However, due to the lack of a genetic approach in human cells, an examination of their role in vivo was severely limited. To study such eukaryotic DNA helicases, we have decided to isolate an RPA-stimulated DNA helicase from the fission yeast,Schizosaccharomyces pombe. S. pombe is similar to higher eukaryotes with respect to many biological processes and can be subjected to most of the genetic techniques developed in S. cerevisiae. In this paper, we report the purification and characterization of a DNA helicase that is stimulated by the heterotrimeric SpRPA only at suboptimal ATP concentrations.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have described the isolation and biochemical properties of a DNA helicase, DNA helicase I, from S. pombe. This helicase activity, which was stimulated by the presence of SpRPA and an ATP-regenerating system, is the first DNA helicase to be purified from fission yeast.We attempted to isolate a functional homolog from S. pombeof two human DNA helicases, helicase α and ε, previously isolated from HeLa cells (29Seo Y.-S. Lee S.-H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13161-13170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Seo Y.-S. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10282-10295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was stimulated by SpRPA, DNA helicase I presented in this report is not likely to be a functional homolog of the two human helicases described above. DNA helicase I was activated markedly by SpRPA only at limiting concentrations of ATP (<0.2 mm), whereas both helicase α and ε were stimulated by human RPA at high ATP concentrations (>1 mm). Unlike helicase α, DNA helicase I did not require a fork-structured substrate (data not shown). Another distinct feature of DNA helicase I is that it is a catalytic DNA-dependent ATPase that hydrolyzes ATP at a high rate (30–50 ATP/s/enzyme) (TableIII). In contrast, helicase α and ε were less active and had much lower ATP turnover rates (2.6 and 0.3 ATP/s/enzyme, respectively). Other DNA helicases from mammalian cells that translocate in the same direction as the DNA helicase I include DNA helicase A (47Thömmes P. Ferrari E. Jessberger R. Hübscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6063-6073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nuclear DNA helicases I and II (10Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from calf thymus, ATPase Q1 (48Seki M. Yanagisawa J. Kohda T. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 268: 523-531Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and human DNA helicases I, II, III, V, and VI from HeLa cells (4Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 11-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Among these DNA helicases, the calf DNA helicase A was the only one that was shown to be significantly stimulated by the heterotrimeric RPA. However, this enzyme was not stimulated by either heterologous human RPA or E. coli SSB. In addition, it was significantly smaller (47 kDa) in size than the S. pombe helicase. However, further experiments are necessary to distinguish whether they are related to each other since the calf helicase A was not examined at low ATP concentrations for RPA stimulation of unwinding. Comparison of other biochemical properties such as preference for nucleotides as energy source, sensitivity to salts, polynucleotide cofactors for ATPase activity, and molecular weight suggests that the DNA helicase I in this study is unlikely to be a functional homolog of any of these 3′ → 5′ mammalian helicases.DNA helicase I is also not likely to be homologous to any knownS. cerevisiae DNA helicase previously described (8Li X.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9578-9584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) translocate in the 5′ → 3′ direction, opposite that of the helicase activity characterized here. Although the Dna2 protein, a DNA helicase recently identified by genetic screening and biochemical studies, has a 3′ → 5′ directionality, its helicase activity requires a forked substrate (52Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) in contrast to the substrate specificity of S. pombe DNA helicase I. It remains to be shown whether ATPase III (49Sugino A. Ryu B.H. Sugino T. Naumovski L. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11744-11750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is similar to DNA helicase I described in this study since comparable biochemical parameters of ATPase III have not been described.We noted that the separation of SpRPA from DNA helicase I was difficult, and it was a major contaminant. Glycerol gradient sedimentation or gel filtration in the presence of varying levels of salt (0.15–0.5 m NaCl) failed to separate the two proteins or change the sedimentation or elution profile (data not shown). The presence of SpRPA in the helicase preparation (glycerol gradient pool I fraction) has made it difficult to evaluate the influence of low levels of SpRPA on DNA helicase I activity. To perform this experiment, we used the glycerol gradient pool II fraction that is relatively devoid of SpRPA (Fig. 2 A, fractions 9 and 10; see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 7 C, low levels of added SpRPA were still stimulatory at the low ATP concentration (0.2 mm). This finding raises the possibility that the helicase might be virtually inactive without SpRPA, especially when the ATP concentration is reduced below a threshold level. These results also suggest that the weak activity observed in the absence of exogenous SpRPA (Fig. 7 B, lane 4) may be partly due to SpRPA present in the helicase preparation.Although several DNA helicases have been shown to be activated by RPA, the exact mechanism by which RPA stimulates unwinding is presently unknown. We postulate two possible mechanism by which SpRPA stimulated DNA helicase I activity: 1) a direct protein-protein interaction between SpRPA and DNA helicase I induces a conformational change that allows the helicase to function efficiently at reduced concentrations of ATP (for example, lowering of the K m for ATP); or 2) SpRPA targets the helicase directly to the partial duplex junction, reducing the level of ATP required for unwinding possibly by avoiding a nonproductive ATP hydrolysis process (for example, translocation along ssDNA). These two possible roles of SpRPA in stimulating the DNA helicase I are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The precise mechanism by which SpRPA stimulates DNA helicase I remains to be elucidated. In addition to the key roles known to be played by RPA in major DNA metabolic processes, a recent study demonstrated that RPA from S. cerevisiae is phosphorylated specifically in vivo by MEC1 upon DNA damage (54Brush G.S. Morrow D.M. Hieter P. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15075-15080Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This finding suggests a novel function for RPA in cell cycle checkpoint signaling when DNA damage occurs. At present, the function of DNA helicase I is not known. Its interaction with RPA, a protein implicated in replication, repair, recombination, and perhaps in checkpoint signaling, suggests that DNA helicase I might be involved in any one if not all of these important reactions. Because DNA helicase I translocates in the 3′ to 5′ direction, it would move on the leading strand toward the replication fork if it were involved in DNA replication. Peptide sequencing of the 95-kDa polypeptide revealed that it is a novel helicase. 2J. S. Park and Y.-S. Seo, unpublished observation. The cloning of the full-length cDNA and genomic DNA for DNA helicase I is underway. The availability of cloned and overexpressed DNA helicase I should permit us to determine whether it is capable of interacting directly with SpRPA. Both biochemical and genetic studies will help clarify the biological function of DNA helicase I in S. pombe. In addition, we hope to identify structurally similar mammalian helicases and use S. pombe genetics to test whether they are functionally related to DNA helicase I.

For this purpose, DNA helicases catalyze a DNA strand separation reaction by breaking hydrogen bonds that hold the DNA strands together. DNA helicases use energy derived from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates for bond breakage and translocation of the enzyme along the DNA duplex. The DNA-unwinding activity catalyzed by a helicase exhibits a specific directionality (5′ → 3′ or 3′ → 5′) with respect to the DNA strand to which the enzyme is bound and moves. DNA helicases are ubiquitous and have been isolated from a wide variety of sources from bacteria to humans as well as bacteriophages and animal viruses. The biochemical properties of a number of DNA helicases have been reviewed extensively (1Matson S.W. Kaiser-Rogers K.A. Annu. Rev.
