https://openalex.org/W1978359460,"Soils are differentiated vertically by coupled chemical, mechanical, and biological transport processes. Soil properties vary with depth, depending on the subsurface stresses, the extent of mixing, and the balance between mass removal in solution or suspension and mass accumulation near the surface. Channels left by decayed roots and burrowing animals allow organic and inorganic detritus and precipitates to move through the soil from above. Accumulation occurs at depths where small pores restrict further passage. Consecutive phases of translocation and root growth stir the soil; these processes constitute an invasive dilatational process that leads to positive cumulative strains. In contrast, below the depth of root penetration and mass additions, mineral dissolution by descending organic acids leads to internal collapse under overburden load. This softened and condensed precursor horizon is transformed into soil by biological activity, which stirs and expands the evolving residuum by invasion by roots and macropore networks that allows mixing of materials from above."
https://openalex.org/W1973198844,"A number of pre-Pleistocene climate records exhibit significant fluctuations at the 100,000-year (100-ky) eccentricity period, before the time of such fluctuations in global ice volume. The origin of these fluctuations has been obscure. Results reported here from a modeling study suggest that such a response can occur over low-latitude land areas involved in monsoon fluctuations. The twice yearly passage of the sun across the equator and the seasonal timing of perihelion interact to increase both 100-ky and 400-ky power in the modeled temperature field. The magnitude of the temperature response is sufficiently large to leave an imprint on the geologic record, and simulated fluctuations resemble those found in records of Triassic lake levels."
https://openalex.org/W1966289866,"An anomaly in science is an observed fact that is difficult to explain in terms of the existing conceptual framework. Anomalies often point to the inadequacy of the current theory and herald a new one. It is argued here that certain scientific anomalies are recognized as anomalies only after they are given compelling explanations within a new conceptual framework. Before this recognition, the peculiar facts are taken as givens or are ignored in the old framework. Such a ""retrorecognition"" phenomenon reveals not only a significant feature of the process of scientific discovery but also an important aspect of human psychology."
https://openalex.org/W2030421686,"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spatial imaging data may be acquired, processed, and interpreted in ways that provide information directly analogous to diffraction experiments, with length scales determined by gradient strengths rather than radiation wavelengths. This approach, originally considered by Mansfield nearly two decades ago, provides access to autocorrelations of sample density that statistically characterize small-scale density variations. These NMR ""Patterson functions"" can be acquired orders of magnitude more rapidly than comparably resolved NMR images and are suitable for spatial characterization of small features in bulk samples, such as morphology in structural materials. Unlike hindered diffusion approaches, neither mobility, penetrants, nor transport time are required for examining granularity and porosity."
https://openalex.org/W2100301665,Algorithms based on graph theory and implemented in a computer program have been used to search for unprecedented reactions. This approach is illustrated by a systematic and exhaustive screening of pericyclic reactions in order to find new reactions useful in the synthesis of conjugated dienes. Two reactions were found. They were optimized by structural variation with the aid of quantum-chemical calculations and were then experimentally verified.
https://openalex.org/W2052586935,Shifts in (87)Sr/(86)Sr and (143)Nd/(144)Nd ratios measured in cumulates from the upper levels of the Muskox mafic intrusion indicate that isotopic and bulk chemical exchange were decoupled across a mafic-silicic liquid interface during crystallization of the intrusion. Modeling of diffusive exchange between liquid layers demonstrates that isotopic compositions of silicate liquids in layered magma chambers may be strongly affected by this process on time scales of 10(3) to 10(4) years. Diffusive contamination can be used to place constraints on the physical processes and time scales of magmatic systems.
https://openalex.org/W1975240282,"Amorphous Fe(2)SiO(4) synthesized at elevated pressures exhibits a Néel transition at a temperature identical to that observed in the crystalline form, T(N) = 65 (+/-2) kelvin at zero pressure. This behavior contrasts sharply with observations on other disordered systems, such as spin glasses, which characteristically exhibit strong ""frustration"" of the spins and consequent marked suppression of the Néel transition."

https://openalex.org/W2085726402,"In January 2010, John Fahey, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of trustees' executive committee of the Washington, D.C.-based National Geographic Society (NGS), must decide how best to organize the 121-year old mission-driven organization for a world of accelerating digital convergence and decreasing magazine sales. Historically a proponent of evolutionary change, he is considering a radical move: creating a senior management position responsible for e-commerce to coordinate web-based offerings and outreach across the Society's various departments, transition NGS from its many disparate and independent direct mail efforts to a more integrated and strategic e-commerce strategy, and leverage the NGS relationship with its members-currently defined as magazine subscribers, since a subscription comes with Society membership. Putting the final touches on the position and its reporting arrangements has led to significant debate within the organization, and Fahey is torn about how to proceed.Learning Objective: This case is designed to show students how leaders manage change in an unpredictable and highly uncertain environment, especially at an iconic organization that is strongly mission-driven. National Geographic is a world-renowned brand, well known for its magazine and environmental commitments. The CEO has long espoused an evolutionary approach to change, but is now facing a world where digital technology and multimedia products threaten to cannibalize and replace the organization's primary revenue source, its magazine. Students consider the nature of mission-driven organizations, the challenges of altering long-established, complacent cultures, the need for accompany shifts in organizational structure and roles, and the best approach to strategy making in an environment that is rapidly changing. The case can be paired with another case, Time Life, Inc. (A), HBS No. 395-012, which features the same CEO facing a similar set of challenges in the media business over a decade earlier. Students can compare the two situations and develop lessons about the need to adapt one's leadership style in analogous but somewhat different circumstances."
