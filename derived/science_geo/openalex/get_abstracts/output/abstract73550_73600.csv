https://openalex.org/W2092780288,Rabbit sperm developed the capacity to fertilize ova when incubated in utero or in vitro in fluids from estrous uteri. Incubation of sperm with beta-amylase in phosphate-buffered Locke's solution also resulted in capacitation. The data suggest that sperm capacitation involves enzymatic alteration of carbo-hydrate-containing seminal macromolecules which coat sperm and inhibit fertilization.
https://openalex.org/W2004171602,"Incubation in vitro of young, adult, male Leucophaea maderae fat body with extracts of corpora cardiaca or intact corpora cardiaca results in stimulation of oxygen consumption but reduction in carbon dioxide evolved from carbohydrate. The carbohydrate is preferentially used for trehalose synthesis, and the endogenous metabolism of the fat body appears to be supported by increased lipid utilization. A hormone from the corpus cardiacum is most likely responsible for these effects and may act at two points, at least, in the glycolytic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2055795015,"Glycerol is metabolized predominantly in the liver, the first step presumably being phosphorylation to alpha-glycerophosphate. When ethanol is present in the blood the rate of glycerol uptake by the splanchnic organs is reduced to about one-third of the control value. At the same time glycerophosphate accumulates in the liver. Hepatic blood flow and oxygen consumption are not influenced by the combined infusion of glycerol and ethanol. The phenomenon may be connected with the increased concentration of the reduced form of diphosphopyridine nucleotide present in the liver during ethanol metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2063614718,"Lithocholic acid was present in the serum of three patients with, jaundice and, in smaller amounts, in two healthy adults. This bile acid occurs naturally in human feces but induces cirrhosis of the liver when fed to a wide variety of experimental animals. The finding of lithocholic acid in blood is of interest because of its possible role in injuring human liver."

https://openalex.org/W2086622027,"ONE of the best-known and least-understood aspects of the behaviour of nidifugous egg-young during the hatching period is the production of sharp, almost metallic sounds by the bird still enclosed in the shell. These have been referred to by most observers as ‘tapping’ sounds, and have been thought to result from contact between bill and shell1."
https://openalex.org/W2036368554,"There lies directly beneath the tapetum lucidum, in the eyes of many elasmobranch fishes, a layer of darkly pigmented choroid cells which, in bright light, extend individual strands that aggregate to form a dark, compound curtain which shields the reflecting tapetal cells. This process is reversed in dim light or in darkness; the tapetum is exposed and visual sensitivity presumably Increased. The black choroid pigment has been isolated, analyzed, and shown to possess the properties of melanin."

https://openalex.org/W2130117280,"FOR the purpose of heat-exchanger calculations for deep hypothermia, the cooling of the blood flowing through a horizontal tube and annulus, with Reynolds number in the range of 50.4–1,025 and Prantl number of 19.6–30.8, was investigated. The apparatus assembly was composed of a chromium-plated brass tube (inside diameter 10.0 mm, outside diameter 12.5 mm, length 550 mm) through which the blood flowed from a higher vessel into a lower one, whence it was pumped back into the upper vessel. Into this circulation system, a heat exchanger compensating the heat losses was introduced. The brass tube was cooled in a parallel water stream from a Höppler thermostat. The respective temperatures were measured with the aid of thermistor thermometers in a sensitive bridge circuit1 accurate to 5 × 10−2 °C. For measuring the outlet temperature the thermistor, incorporated in a silver member (diameter 6 mm, length 8 mm) star-shaped in cross-section, was closely inserted into the outlet elbow, deflecting the blood stream vertically. When using a member of greater diameter (15 mm), the thermistor data depended markedly on the deflexion of the blood stream from the vertical direction due to inaccurate positioning of the elbow piece. If the usual mixing in the outlet site were used, the blood would suffer damage, on one hand, or be heated up through friction, on the other. Measurements were carried out in 4 series. Fresh human blood was used, diluted with glucose in the ratio 2 : 1 in the first two series, and diluted with rheo-dextran in the ratios 9 : 2 and 10 : 3 in the other two series."

https://openalex.org/W2005323991,IT has been reported that first and second set skin grafts from parthenogenetic Beltsville Small White turkey sires to some of their progeny by unrelated turkey females are rejected by typical homograft reactions. The finding that skin from any one parthenogenetic sire can be compatible with some of his progeny and incompatible with others was interpreted as evidence of segregation having occurred at one or more of his genetic loci assumed to control histocompatibility. On this basis it was concluded that a detectable degree of heterozygosity can exist in male turkey parthenogens1.

https://openalex.org/W1970082886,"IT has been suggested that acetylcholine and catechol-amines are involved both in central and peripheral transmission in mammals1–3 and that they show a similar pattern of antagonism in each situation4. Further, it has been shown clinically that monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which increase the concentration of catechol-amines in the central nervous system (CNS), usually produce mental excitation whereas anti-cholinesterase drugs which raise the level of acetylcholine in the CNS generally produce depression. The latter effect has been shown by Grob5–7 and Rowntree8 in normal and psychotic patients."
