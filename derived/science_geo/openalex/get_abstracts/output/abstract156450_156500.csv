In particular, the speed with which a physical device can process information is limited by its energy and the amount of information that it can process is limited by the number of degrees of freedom it possesses. Here I explore the physical limits of computation as determined by the speed of light c, the quantum scale ℏ and the gravitational constant G. As an example, I put quantitative bounds to the computational power of an ‘ultimate laptop’ with a mass of one kilogram confined to a volume of one litre."
https://openalex.org/W2043346837,"Nicotine reinforces smoking behavior by activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the midbrain dopaminergic (DA) reward centers, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Although nicotine induces prolonged excitation of the VTA in vivo, the nAChRs on the DA neurons desensitize in seconds. Here, we show that activation of nAChRs on presynaptic terminals in the VTA enhances glutamatergic inputs to DA neurons. Under conditions where the released glutamate can activate NMDA receptors, long-term potentiation (LTP) of the excitatory inputs is induced. Both the short- and the long-term effects of nicotine required activation of presynaptic alpha7 subunit-containing nAChRs. These results can explain the long-term excitation of brain reward areas induced by a brief nicotine exposure. They also show that nicotine alters synaptic function through mechanisms that are linked to learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2044712342,"To determine how signals emanating from Trk transmit neurotrophin actions in primary neurons, we tested the ability of TrkB mutated at defined effector binding sites to promote sympathetic neuron survival or local axon growth. TrkB stimulated signaling proteins and induced survival and growth in a manner similar to TrkA. TrkB mutated at the Shc binding site supported survival and growth poorly relative to wild-type TrkB, whereas TrkB mutated at the PLC-γ1 binding site supported growth and survival well. TrkB-mediated neuronal survival was dependent on PI3-kinase and to a lesser extent MEK activity, while growth depended upon both MEK and PI3-kinase activities. These results indicate that the TrkB-Shc site mediates both neuronal survival and axonal outgrowth by activating the PI3-kinase and MEK signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2036380584,"In humans, defects of the corticospinal tract have been attributed to mutations in the gene encoding L1 CAM, a phenotype that is reproduced in L1-deficient mice. Using coculture assays, we report that Sema3A secreted from the ventral spinal cord repels cortical axons from wild-type but not from L1-deficient mice. L1 and neuropilin-1 (NP-1) form a stable complex, and their extracellular domains can directly associate. Thus, L1 is a component of the Sema3A receptor complex, and L1 mutations may disrupt Sema3A signaling in the growth cone, leading to guidance errors. Addition of soluble L1Fc chimeric molecules does not restore Sema3A responsiveness of L1-deficient axons; instead, it converts the repulsion of wild-type axons into an attraction, further supporting a function for L1 in the Sema3A transducing pathways within the growth cone."
https://openalex.org/W2033802853,"Antioxidant response element (ARE) regulates the induction of a number of cellular antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes. However, the signaling pathways that lead to ARE activation remain unknown. Here, we report that the expression of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase (TAK1), and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1) in HepG2 cells activated the ARE reporter gene, whereas the expression of their dominant-negative mutants impaired ARE activation by the chemicals sodium arsenite and mercury chloride. Coexpression of downstream kinases, MAP kinase kinase 4, MAP kinase kinase 6, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-1, but not MAP kinase kinase 3 and p38, augmented ARE activation by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. The coexpression of a basic leucine zipper transcription factor Nrf2 but not c-Jun also greatly enhanced the activation of reporter gene by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1; however, a dominant-negative mutant of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) blocked this event. Furthermore, when overexpressed, MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 induced the expression of heme oxygenase-1, a gene regulated by ARE, and the cotransfection with the dominant-negative mutant of Nrf2 abolished the induction. Taken together, these results suggest that MAP kinase pathways that are activated by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 may link chemical signals to Nrf2, leading to the activation of ARE-dependent genes.

Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 8: 180-186Crossref Scopus (2266) Google Scholar, 2Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). To date, at least six MAPK members have been identified in mammalian cells. Three of the MAPK members have been extensively studied: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) (3Gomez N. Cohen P. Nature. 1991; 353: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs, also called stress-activated protein kinases) (4Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

The activity of these MAPKs is induced through the phosphorylation of their threonyl and tyrosyl residues within a tripeptide motif TXY by a dual specificity kinase termed MAP kinase kinase (MKK), which in turn is phosphorylated and activated by an upstream kinase generally called MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) (8Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). The first MAPKKK identified is Raf-1. This kinase activates ERK through MEK1 or MEK2 but has little effect on JNK and p38 pathways (1Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 8: 180-186Crossref Scopus (2266) Google Scholar). However, unlike Raf-1 MEKK1, a MAPKKK isolated after Raf-1 predominantly stimulates JNK activity that is mediated by MKK4 or MKK7 (9Kyriakis J. Avruch J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Recently, several other members of the MAPKKK family have been identified including TAK1 (10Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar) and ASK1 (11Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). These kinases are able to activate JNK through MKK4 and p38 through MKK3 or MKK6, but they do not affect the ERK pathway. Although MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 may regulate different downstream kinases, they are preferentially activated by various stress stimuli and are involved in the regulation of stress signals. Exposure of human and rodent cells to phenolic antioxidants or certain electrophils leads to the protection against the toxic and neoplastic effects of many carcinogens (12Wattenberg L.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1972; 48: 1425-1430PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pezzuto J.M. Arnason J.T. Mata R. Romeo J.T. Recent Advances in Phytochemistry: Phytochemistry of Medicinal Plants. Plenum Press, New York1995: 19-45Google Scholar). Such a chemopreventive property of these compounds has been presumably ascribed to the ability of the compounds to induce several detoxifying enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and quinone reductase (14Prochaska H.J. De Long M.J. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8232-8236Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that the induction of detoxifying enzyme activity occurs at the transcriptional level and is regulated by acis-acting element that is present in the promoters of detoxifying enzyme genes defined as an antioxidant response element (ARE) (15Rushmore T.H. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14648-14653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or electrophil response element (16Friling R.S. Bensimon A. Tichauer Y. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6258-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Later, ARE was also found in the promoters of genes that encode cellular antioxidant enzymes, such as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (17Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (18Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M.K. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), and ferritin L and H chains (19Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), and was activated by various oxidative stresses. Thus, ARE is not only responsive to antioxidants but also to oxidative stress. Understanding the mechanism by which ARE senses different signals will be of considerable interest. Because the ARE core sequence (GTGACNNNGC) shows a similarity with the activating protein-1 (AP-1)-binding site (TGACTCA), a number of studies have examined the roles of AP-1 proteins such as c-Jun and c-Fos in the activation of ARE and have yielded controversial results (20Friling R.S. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Jaiswal A.K.

However, several lines of present evidence indicate that another member of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family, Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), may be involved in the activation of ARE. First, Nrf2 is able to bind to the ARE in association with other members of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family, such as Maf G or Maf K (24Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S.T.I. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y.-I. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 236: 313-322Google Scholar). Second, the transient expression of Nrf2 transactivates the ARE-linked reporter gene (17Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 18Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M.K. Cook J.L. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Nrf2 knockout mice (Nrf2−/−) show a defect in the induction of GST by butylated hydroxyanisole (24Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S.T.I. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y.-I. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 236: 313-322Google Scholar) and are extremely susceptible to the pulmonary injury induced by butylated hydroxytoluene (26Chan K. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12731-12736Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Although progress has been made in the identification of an ARE-binding protein, the signal transduction pathways that are able to activate the Nrf2·ARE complex remain unknown. Previously, we have demonstrated that blocking the ERK pathway attenuates the induction of ARE-mediated gene expression by tert-butylhydroquinone and sulforaphane (27Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), whereas the inhibition of the p38 pathway shows an opposite effect (28Yu R. Mandlekar S. Lei W. Fahl W.E. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2322-2372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) implying the involvement of MAPKs in the modulation of ARE-mediated gene expression. In this study, we explored the role of MAPK pathways that are preferentially activated by the stress stimuli in the regulation of ARE activity. As described below, the activation of MAPK pathways by the overexpression of MEKK1, TAK1, or ASK1 induced ARE reporter gene activity, which was mediated by a Nrf2-dependent mechanism. Activation of ARE by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 also involved MKK4, MKK6, and JNK1 but not MKK3 and p38.

To generate a dominant-negative Nrf2 mutant, a DNA fragment that contains a Cap'n'Collar homology region and a basic leucine-zipper domain (amino acids 399–589) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-AAGCTTACTCACGTGCATGATGCCCAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGCGGCTAGTTTTTCTTAACATCTGG-3′ (antisense). The amplified fragment was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and then inserted in-frame into pEGFP-C3 at HindIII/SacII sites (CLONTECH). HepG2 cells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well. 24 h after plating, cells were transfected with expression vectors using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as indicated in the figure legends. In each transfection, 0.5 μg of pCH110-β-galactosidase plasmid and 1 μg of ARE-TI-luciferase reporter construct were used, and the total amount of DNA in each well was adjusted to 5.5 μg with empty vector. Cells were incubated with transfection mixtures for 7 h and then cultured in fresh medium for an additional 36 h before harvesting. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was determined by the method provided by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). After treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1× reporter lysis buffer. After brief centrifugation, a 20-μl supernatant was aliquoted and assayed for luciferase activity with a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). The luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity. HepG2 cells were plated in 10-cm-diameter plates at a density of 106 cells/plate. Cells were transfected as described above except that the total DNA in each plate was 25 μg. After transfection, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered-saline and harvested in a cell lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 100 μmNa3VO4, 5 μm ZnCl2, 2 mm iodoacetic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Cell lysates were homogenized by passing through a 23-gauge needle three times and cleared by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. HA-tagged ERK, JNK, or p38 was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody in the presence of protein A-Sepharose 4B conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and assayed for kinase activity as described previously (27Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Kong T.A.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated kinase was resuspended in a 30-μl kinase assay buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) with an addition of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μg of the indicated substrates. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min in JNK1 and p38 assay or 15 min in ERK2 assay, kinase reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 4× Laemmli buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Phosphorylated products were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Cell lysates were prepared as described in immunocomplex kinase assays. 25 μg of protein, as determined by the Bradford method, was resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry transfer system (Fisher). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 8 mg/ml NaCl, and 0.2 mg/ml KCl at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-HA monoclonal antibody, polyclonal rabbit anti-HO-1, or anti-β-actin antibodies in TBS at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times with TBS, the membrane was blotted with peroxidase-conjugated donkey, anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 1 h. The protein was visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). MAPK pathways are activated through serial phosphorylation. To address the general roles of MAPKs in the activation of ARE-dependent genes, we focused on the upstream kinases, MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. Because MEKK1 and ASK1 but not TAK1 are highly active when overexpressed (11Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar, 32Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of cotransfection with the wild-type MEKK1 or ASK1 or a constitutively active TAK1 mutant, TAK1ΔN, on the activity of the ARE reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 1 A, overexpression of MEKK1, TAK1ΔN, and ASK1 in HepG2 cells stimulated ARE reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner. To demonstrate a specific role of ARE in this event, we also conducted a transfection experiment with a reporter construct (TI-Luc) that lacks an ARE enhancer. No significant induction was observed. In addition, overexpression of kinase-defective mutants of MEKK1, TAK1, or ASK1 had little effect on the activity of the ARE reporter gene (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the kinase activity is essential for the induction of ARE-mediated gene expression by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. ARE is activated by a variety of chemicals. Activation of ARE by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 implicates a potential role of these kinases in the ARE activation by exogenous stimuli. To address this issue, we examined the effect of their dominant-negative mutants on the activation of ARE-dependent reporter gene by several electrophilic compounds. Although enforced expression of dominant-negative mutants of MEKK1, TAK1, or ASK1 did not affect ARE activation bytert-butylhydroquinone, these mutants significantly diminished the induction of reporter gene activity by sodium arsenite and to a lesser extent, decreased the reporter gene activity induced by mercury chloride (Fig. 1 C). This result suggests that the activation of MEKK1-, TAK1-, or ASK1-dependent pathways may contribute to the induction of ARE-mediated gene expression by some chemicals. Activation of MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 leads to the activation of downstream MAPKs. To identify the MAPKs that were activated in the cells overexpressing the MEKK1, TAK1ΔN, and ASK1, we performed transient transfection with the vectors encoding HA-tagged ERK2, JNK1, or p38 and different forms of MEKK1, TAK1, or ASK1. The kinase activity of ERK2, JNK1, and p38 was then analyzed by immunocomplex kinase assays with anti-HA antibody. Cotransfection of HepG2 cells with MEKK1, TAK1ΔN, or ASK1 resulted in substantial activation of JNK and p38 but not ERK2, although a modest induction of ERK2 activity was observed in MEKK1-tranfected cells as compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2 A). As a negative control, cotransfection with the kinase-defective mutants, MEKK1-KR, TAK1-KW, or ASK1-KR, did not activate JNK and p38. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis with anti-HA antibody revealed an equal expression level of epitope HA-ERK, HA-JNK, and HA-p38 in different transfections. Thus, the overexpression of MEKK1, TAK1ΔN, and ASK1 preferentially activated JNK and p38 pathways but not ERK.Figure 2Opposing roles of JNK and p38 in the activation of ARE by MEKK1 , TAK1 , and ASK1. A, activation of JNK and p38 but not ERK by overexpression of MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. HepG2 cells were plated in 10-cm-diameter Petri dishes and cotransfected with 10 μg of expression vector of HA-JNK1, HA-p38α, or HA-ERK2 together with 15 μg of expression vector of MEKK1, ASK1, TAK1ΔN, or empty vector. Exogenous JNK1, p38α, or ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from the whole cell lysates with anti-HA antibody and assayed for kinase activity with their respective substrate, GST-c-Jun, GST-activating transcription factor 2 (GST-ATF2), and myelin basic protein (MBP). The results shown are examples of two independent experiments. B, effects of JNK and p38 and their dominant-negative mutants on the activation of ARE reporter gene by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. HepG2 cells were plated into six-well plates and cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pCH110-β-galactosidase plasmid and 1 μg of TI-ARE-luciferase reporter gene and 2 μg of empty vector or expression vector of MEKK1, TAK1ΔN, ASK1 plus 2 μg of the expression vector of JNK1 or p38 or their dominant-negative mutants, JNK1(APF) and p38(AGF). Luciferase activity was analyzed as in Fig. 1 A. The data presented are means ± S.D. of four separate experiments done in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because both JNK and p38 were activated by three MAPKKKs, we next examined the roles of JNK and p38 in ARE activation by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the coexpression of JNK1 enhanced the activity of the ARE reporter gene that was induced by all three MAPKKKs. Consistent with such a positive role of JNK, the cotransfection with JNK1(APF), a dominant-negative mutant of JNK1, suppressed the activation of ARE reporter gene by the three MAPKKKs. However, unlike JNK, the expression of wild-type p38 inhibited the induction of the ARE reporter gene by MEKK1, TAK1ΔN, and ASK1, whereas a dominant-negative mutant of p38, p38α(AGF), potentiated such induction. This result substantiates a negative role of p38 in the ARE-mediated induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes reported previously by Yu et al. (28Yu R. Mandlekar S. Lei W. Fahl W.E. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2322-2372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). MEKK1 can directly phosphorylate and activate MKK4 that, in turn, activates JNK and p38. TAK1 and ASK1 can also activate JNK through MKK4, but they activate p38 through MKK3 and MKK6. Hence, we asked whether MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6 are involved in the ARE activation by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the expression of MKK4 and MKK6 caused the induction of ARE-mediated gene expression in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, the expression of MKK3 decreased the basal activity of the ARE reporter gene. To provide further evidence for the roles of MKK3, MKK4, and MKK6 in the MEKK1-, TAK1-, and ASK1-induced ARE activation, we used the dominant-negative mutants. Coexpression of a dominant-negative MKK4 mutant (MKK4(Ala)) diminished the activation of ARE reporter gene by all three MAPKKKs (Fig. 3 B). Coexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of MKK6 (DN-MKK6) reduced the ARE activation by TAK1ΔN and ASK1 but not by MEKK1 (Fig. 3 B). This result suggests that the activation of ARE by MEKK1 involves MKK4, whereas the activation of ARE by TAK1 and ASK1 may involve both MKK4 and MKK6. Unlike MKK4(Ala) and DN-MKK6, MKK3(Ala), a dominant-negative mutant of MKK3, augmented the induction of ARE reporter gene by TAK1ΔN, ASK1, and, to a lesser extent, MEKK1 (Fig. 3 B), supporting a negative role of MKK3 in the regulation of ARE-mediated gene expression as described previously (28Yu R. Mandlekar S. Lei W. Fahl W.E. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2322-2372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). After demonstrating the downstream signaling kinases involved in the activation of ARE by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1, we sought to identify the transcription factors that convey the kinase signaling to the ARE. A well known target of these MAPK pathways is c-Jun (33Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar) that has also been shown to bind to the ARE sequence (20Friling R.S. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined the role of c-Jun in ARE-mediated gene expression induced by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. HepG2 cells were cotransfected with c-Jun or its dominant-negative mutant (TAM 67) and with different MAPKKKs. Subsequently, the induction of ARE reporter gene was analyzed by luciferase activity assays. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the expression of c-Jun alone induced approximately a 2-fold increase in the activity of ARE reporter gene as compared with vector-transfected cells. However, the coexpression of c-Jun had no effect on the activation of ARE reporter gene by MEKK1, TAK1ΔN, and ASK1, and the cotransfection with TAM 67 had no effect either. We also examined the effect of c-Jun on the expression of 3TP-reporter gene, a construct that contains three copies of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element. As expected, c-Jun activated 3TP-reporter gene in a dose-dependent fashion, and cotransfection with TAM 67 inhibited such activation (Fig. 4 B). However, the induction of ARE reporter gene by c-Jun was modest, and more interestingly, a relatively higher amount of c-Jun (more than 2 μg) suppressed the ARE reporter gene activity (Fig. 4 B). Thus, we conclude that c-Jun is unlikely to be a mediator of MEKK1-, TAK1-, or ASK1-induced expression of ARE-dependent genes. As discussed earlier, accumulating evidence indicates that a basic leucine zipper transcription factor Nrf2 plays an essential role in ARE-mediated induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes (34Nguyen T. Huang H.C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 35Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). We next explored the role of Nrf2 in mediating the activation of ARE by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. Upon overexpression, Nrf2 induced dose-dependent activation of the ARE reporter gene (Fig. 5 A). This transcriptional activity of Nrf2 was dramatically enhanced by cotransfection with MEKK1, TAK1ΔN, or ASK1 (Fig. 5 B). More interestingly, transfection with a dominant-negative Nrf2 mutant (DN-Nrf2) that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain not only inhibited ARE basal activity but also abolished ARE activation by MEKK1, TAK1ΔN, and ASK1 (Fig. 5 B). Similar results were obtained when Nrf2 or its dominant-negative mutant (DN-Nrf2) was cotransfected with MKK4 or MKK6 (Fig. 5 C). However, MKK3 inhibited Nrf2-induced expression of ARE reporter gene (Fig. 5 C), consistent with its negative role in ARE gene expression. These data suggest that the activation of ARE by MEKK1, TAK1, ASK1, and the downstream kinases is mediated by a Nrf2-dependent mechanism. ARE regulates the induction of a number of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes, such as GST, quinone reductase, and HO-1. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of ARE activation by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1, we examined the induction of HO-1 in HepG2 cells transfected with these MAPKKKs. As shown in Fig. 6 A, when overexpressed, MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 induced the expression of HO-1 as revealed by Western blotting analysis. Treatment with sodium arsenite also induced HO-1 expression, which has been shown by others (18Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M.K. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 35Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Coexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of Nrf2 (DN-Nrf2) abolished the MEKK1 induction of HO-1 (Fig. 6 B). Consistent with the previous result (18Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M.K. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar), DN-Nrf2 also blocked the induction of HO-1 by sodium arsenite (Fig. 6 B). A similar result was obtained when TAK1 or ASK1 was cotransfected with DN-Nrf2 (data not shown). Therefore, MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 are able to activate endogenous genes that are regulated by ARE and Nrf2. In this study, we provide evidence for the roles of MAP kinase pathways in the activation of ARE-dependent genes. The expression of MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 induces ARE reporter gene expression, which is potentiated by the coexpression of downstream kinases, MKK4, MKK6, and JNK1, but not by MKK3 or p38. Coexpression of a transcription factor Nrf2 also greatly enhanced ARE activation by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1, which was abolished by a dominant-negative mutant of Nrf2. In contrast, cotransfection with c-Jun or its dominant-negative mutant (c-Jun TAM 67) had no effect. Thus, this study demonstrates for the first time that the kinase pathways activated by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 are able to induce ARE-mediated gene expression and suggests that the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 can be regulated as a phosphorylation mechanism. MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 are activated by a variety of stress stimuli, such as UV irradiation (29Chen Y.R. Wang X. Templeton D. Davis R.J. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), osmotic stress (36Shirakabe K. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Gotoh Y.

Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). Although the precise biological roles of their activation are not clear, MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 have been implicated in the induction of apoptosis. For example, overexpression of MEKK1 has been shown to induce apoptosis in Swiss 3T3 and REF52 fibroblasts (39Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Diener K.M. Lange-Carter C.A. Gleavy J. Jarpe M.B. Minden A. Karin M. Zon L.I. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3229-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of a kinase-defective mutant of MEKK1 has been shown to block the apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor withdrawal (40Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5019) Google Scholar) and anti-cancer agent chelerythrine (38Yu R. Mandlekar S. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9612-9619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Activation of ASK1 has also been shown to be required for the apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α (11Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1988) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that the activation of MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 leads to the induction of ARE-mediated reporter gene expression, suggesting that these kinases can be involved in the regulation of genes that encode detoxifying or antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase, quinone reductase, heme oxygenase-1, and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase. As discussed earlier, induction of these detoxifying enzymes facilitates the excretion of toxic compounds and the removal of reactive oxygen species, thereby protecting cells against chemical insults and oxidative stresses. In this respect, MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 may also regulate cell protective and/or survival signaling, contrasting their roles in the induction of apoptosis. The biological consequence of the activation of these signaling pathways may depend on the nature of stimuli and/or cellular context. Although both JNK1 and p38 are activated by the overexpression of MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1, our results indicate that they may play different roles in the regulation of ARE-mediated gene expression. Coexpression of JNK1 potentiates the induction of ARE reporter gene expression by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1, whereas its dominant-negative mutant JNK1(APF) shows the opposite effect, indicative of a positive role for JNK. Unlike JNK, however, when p38 was overexpressed, it not only inhibited ARE basal activity but also suppressed ARE activation by the MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. This result supports our previous observation that p38 acts as a negative regulator of the ARE-mediated induction of phase II detoxifying enzymes by different chemicals (28Yu R. Mandlekar S. Lei W. Fahl W.E. Tan T.-H. Kong A.-N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2322-2372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we also found that the ERK pathway but not JNK is potently activated by tert-butylhydroquinone and sulforaphane. Blockade of ERK activation impairs the induction of quinone reductase and ARE reporter gene expression by the inducers (27Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Kong T.A.-N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ERK and JNK pathways may link different signals to the ARE reporter gene. Therefore, differential activation of MAPKs, such as JNK and ERK versus p38, will have different consequences on the ARE-mediated gene expression and may provide a mechanism for controlling intracellular levels of protective enzymes after challenges with different stress stimuli. Activation of MEKK1, TAK1, or ASK1 initiates a kinase cascade that leads to the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors, thereby stimulating transcriptional activation of various MAPK-dependent genes. One of the transcription factors known to be regulated by MEKK1, TAK1, or ASK1 pathway is c-Jun (33Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar), which has also been shown to be a component of ARE-binding proteins (20Friling R.S. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Jaiswal A.K. Pharmacogenetics. 1994; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that c-Jun does not seem to play a role in the activation of ARE by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. First, the coexpression of c-Jun or its dominant-negative mutant (TAM 67) does not affect the induction of ARE reporter gene expression by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. Second, the overexpression of c-Jun strongly stimulates the activity of 3TP-reporter gene that contains three copies of AP-1 binding sites but marginally activates the ARE reporter gene. In contrast to c-Jun, Nrf2 effectively induces ARE-mediated gene expression. Most importantly, the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 is dramatically enhanced upon cotransfection with MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1, which is abolished by a Nrf2 mutant that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that transcriptional activation of ARE-dependent genes by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 is mediated by the phosphorylation of Nrf2. Indeed, by analyzing the amino acid sequence, several potential MAPK phosphorylation sites were found to be located within the transactivation domain of Nrf2 (41Hayes J.D. Ellis E.M. Neal G.E. Harrison D.J. Manson M.M. Downes C.P. Wolf C.R. Lane D.P. Cellular Responses to Stress. Portland Press, London, U. K.1999: 141-168Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, a deletion mutant that lacks these putative phosphorylation sites lost responsiveness to MEKK1 and TAK1, as well as ASK1 in a GAL4-Nrf2 fusion protein assay. 2R. Yu and A.-N. T. Kong, unpublished results.Whether these sites are phosphorylated in vivo by JNK or other MAPK members is currently under investigation in our laboratory. In summary, we have demonstrated that the MAPK pathways activated by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1 induce ARE-mediated gene expression. Coexpression of Nrf2 but not c-Jun strongly augments the ARE activation by MEKK1, TAK1, and ASK1. Thus, this study presents the signaling pathways that may link the stress signals to the Nrf2. The future challenge is to study how Nrf2 activity is regulated by phosphorylation and its role in ARE activation by various inducers. We thank Drs. Roger J. Davis, Michael Karin, Tatyana A.

https://openalex.org/W2044874534,"We describe a technique for rapid labeling of a large number of cells in the nervous system with many different colors. By delivering lipophilic dye-coated particles to neuronal preparations with a “gene gun,” individual neurons and glia whose membranes are contacted by the particles are quickly labeled. Using particles that are each coated with different combinations of various lipophilic dyes, many cells within a complex neuronal network can be simultaneously labeled with a wide variety of colors. This approach is most effective in living material but also labels previously fixed material. In living material, labeled neurons continue to show normal synaptic responses and undergo dendritic remodeling. This technique is thus useful for studying structural plasticity of neuronal circuits in living preparations. In addition, the Golgi-like labeling of neurons with many different colors provides a novel way to study neuronal connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2058699857,"We studied the role of PDZ proteins GRIP, ABP, and PICK1 in GluR2 AMPA receptor trafficking. An epitope-tagged MycGluR2 subunit, when expressed in hippocampal cultured neurons, was specifically targeted to the synaptic surface. With the mutant MycGluR2Δ1-10, which lacks the PDZ binding site, the overall dendritic intracellular transport and the synaptic surface targeting were not affected. However, over time, MycGluR2Δ1-10 accumulated at synapses significantly less than MycGluR2. Notably, a single residue substitution, S880A, which blocks binding to ABP/GRIP but not to PICK1, reduced synaptic accumulation to the same extent as the PDZ site truncation. We conclude that the association of GluR2 with ABP and/or GRIP but not PICK1 is essential for maintaining the synaptic surface accumulation of the receptor, possibly by limiting its endocytotic rate."
https://openalex.org/W2033021180,"Coordination between sequential steps in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, including clathrin coat formation, fission, and uncoating, appears to involve proteinprotein interactions. Here, we show that compounds that disrupt interactions of the SH3 domain of endophilin with dynamin and synaptojanin impair synaptic vesicle endocytosis in a living synapse. Two distinct endocytic intermediates accumulated. Free clathrin-coated vesicles were induced by a peptide-blocking endophilin's SH3 domain and by antibodies to the proline-rich domain (PRD) of synaptojanin. Invaginated clathrin-coated pits were induced by the same peptide and by the SH3 domain of endophilin. We suggest that the SH3 domain of endophilin participates in both fission and uncoating and that it may be a key component of a molecular switch that couples the fission reaction to uncoating."
https://openalex.org/W2153781529,"The mechanisms employed by the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) to mediate neurotrophin-dependent apoptosis are poorly defined. Two-hybrid analyses were used to identify proteins involved in p75NTR apoptotic signaling, and a p75NTR binding partner termed NRAGE (for neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE homolog) was identified. NRAGE binds p75NTR in vitro and in vivo, and NRAGE associates with the plasma membrane when NGF is bound to p75NTR. NRAGE blocks the physical association of p75NTR with TrkA, and, conversely, TrkA overexpression eliminates NRAGE-mediated NGF-dependent death, indicating that interactions of NRAGE or TrkA with p75NTR are functionally and physically exclusive. NRAGE overexpression facilitates cell cycle arrest and permits NGF-dependent apoptosis within sympathetic neuron precursors cells. Our results show that NRAGE contributes to p75NTR-dependent cell death and suggest novel functions for MAGE family proteins."

Introduction of transgenes expressing PrP into such mice restores susceptibility to scrapie. We find that truncated PrP devoid of the five copper binding octarepeats still sustains scrapie infection; however, incubation times are longer and prion titers and protease-resistant PrP are about 30-fold lower than in wild-type mice. Surprisingly, brains of terminally ill animals show no histopathology typical for scrapie. However, in the spinal cord, infectivity, gliosis, and motor neuron loss are as in scrapie-infected wild-type controls. Thus, while the region comprising the octarepeats is not essential for mediating pathogenesis and prion replication, it modulates the extent of these events and of disease presentation."
https://openalex.org/W1984770038,"Tau, MAP2, and MAP4 are members of a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) family that are each expressed as and isoforms. These isoforms arise from tightly controlled tissue-specific and/or developmentally regulated alternative splicing of a 31-amino acid long inter-repeat:repeat module, raising the possibility that different MAP isoforms may possess some distinct functional capabilities. Consistent with this hypothesis, regulatory mutations in the human tau gene that disrupt the normal balance between 3-repeat and 4-repeat tau isoform expression lead to a collection of neurodegenerative diseases known as FTDP-17 (fronto-temporal dementias and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17), which are characterized by the formation of pathological tau filaments and neuronal cell death. Unfortunately, very little is known regarding structural and functional differences between the isoforms. In our previous analyses, we focused on 4-repeat tau structure and function. Here, we investigate 3-repeat tau, generating a series of truncations, amino acid substitutions, and internal deletions and examining the functional consequences. 3-Repeat tau possesses a core microtubule binding domain composed of its first two repeats and the intervening inter-repeat. This observation is in marked contrast to the widely held notion that tau possesses multiple independent tubulin-binding sites aligned in sequence along the length of the protein. In addition, we observed that the carboxyl-terminal sequences downstream of the repeat region make a strong but indirect contribution to microtubule binding activity in 3-repeat tau, which is in contrast to the negligible effect of these same sequences in 4-repeat tau. Taken together with previous work, these data suggest that 3-repeat and 4-repeat tau assume complex and distinct structures that are regulated differentially, which in turn suggests that they may possess isoform-specific functional capabilities. The relevance of isoform-specific structure and function to normal tau action and the onset of neurodegenerative disease are discussed."

A role for these receptors in the presynaptic control of transmitter release has been proposed but remains controversial. Here, KAR agonists are shown to enhance fiber excitability, and a number of experiments show that this is a direct effect of KARs on the presynaptic fibers. In addition, KAR activation inhibits evoked transmitter release from mossy fiber synapses. Synaptic release of glutamate from either neighboring mossy fiber synapses or associational/commisural (A/C) synapses results in the activation of these presynaptic ionotropic KARs. These results, along with previous studies, indicate that KARs, through the endogenous release of glutamate, mediate excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), alter presynaptic excitability, and modulate transmitter release."

We show that expression of a zebrafish homolog of Drosophila atonal, ath5, sweeps across the eye predicting the wave of neuronal differentiation. By analyzing the regulation of ath5 expression, we have elucidated the mechanisms that regulate initiation and spread of neurogenesis in the retina. ath5 expression is lost in Nodal pathway mutant embryos lacking axial tissues that include the prechordal plate. A likely role for axial tissue is to induce optic stalk cells that subsequently regulate ath5 expression. Our results suggest that a series of inductive events, initiated from the prechordal plate and progressing from the optic stalks, regulates the spread of neuronal differentiation across the zebrafish retina."

The biogeochemical nitrogen cycle represents a network of reactions catalyzed by enzymes with different metal cofactors, which allows for redox transitions of nitrogen between its oxidation state (+5), as in nitrate, and (−3), as in ammonia and its most abundant form dinitrogen. The one respiratory pathway that covers the whole range between nitrate and ammonia is the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (1Cole J.A. Brown C.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1980; 7: 65-72Crossref Google Scholar). Hereby, nitrate is first reduced to nitrite in a 2-electron step by a nitrate reductase, and subsequently the product nitrite is converted to ammonia in a 6-electron step catalyzed by a cytochrome c nitrite reductase (NiR),1 the subject of this study. Cytochrome c nitrite reductases are pentaheme enzymes with a molecular mass of 55–65 kDa, encoded by a single gene termednrfA (2Darwin A. Hussain H. Griffiths L. Grove J. Sambongi Y. Busby S. Cole J.

However, whether ERK plays an essential role or is implicated in all major components of cardiac hypertrophy remains controversial. Using a selective MEK inhibitor, U0126, and a selective Raf inhibitor, SB-386023, to block the ERK signaling pathway at two different levels and adenovirus-mediated transfection of dominant-negative Raf, we studied the role of ERK signaling in response of cultured rat cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic agonists, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and phenylephrine (PE). U0126 and SB-386023 blocked ET-1 and PE-induced ERK but not p38 and JNK activation in cardiomyocytes. Both compounds inhibited ET-1 and PE-induced protein synthesis and increased cell size, sarcomeric reorganization, and expression of β-myosin heavy chain in myocytes with IC50 values of 1–2 μm. Furthermore, both inhibitors significantly reduced ET-1- and PE-induced expression of atrial natriuretic factor. In cardiomyocytes transfected with a dominant-negative Raf, ET-1- and PE-induced increase in cell size, sarcomeric reorganization, and atrial natriuretic factor production were remarkably attenuated compared with the cells infected with an adenovirus-expressing green fluorescence protein.

Braunwald E. Braunwald E. Heart Disease. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1997: 394-398Google Scholar). Although the hypertrophic response is initially a compensatory mechanism that augments cardiac output, sustained hypertrophy can lead to dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and sudden death. Despite the diverse stimuli that lead to cardiac hypertrophy, there is a prototypical final molecular response of cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic signals that involves an increase in cell size and protein synthesis, enhanced sarcomere organization, and re-expression of embryonic cardiac genes, β-myocine heavy chain (β-MHC),1 and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) (2Swynghedauw B.

The cause and effect of cardiac hypertrophy have been extensively documented, but the underlying molecular mechanisms that couple hypertrophic signals initiated at the cell membranes to the reprogramming of cardiomyocyte gene expression remain poorly understood. Numerous studies have proposed that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade is involved in the hypertrophic response (for review see Ref. 5Sugden P.H. Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The initial finding was that G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) hypertrophic agonists stimulate ERK activation. Subsequent studies focusing on the role of the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway have provided considerable support for this hypothesis (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Andersson M.B. Clerk A. Lazou A.

The controversy stems from various reports suggesting that blockade of ERK signaling pathway effects some, but not all, components of hypertrophic responses (7Gillespie-Brown J. Fuller S.J.

The controversies may stem from the different techniques used in the studies. The present study used an experimental design that does not require overexpression of the proteins involved but rather inhibition of the endogenous kinases by the two types of inhibitors, U0126, a new potent and selective inhibitor of MEK1/2 (17Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol.

In addition, we used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to express Raf−, a dominant inhibitory mutant of Raf (19Hertig C.M. Kubalak S.W. Wang Y. Chien K.R. J. Biol.

Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was monitored by the following characteristic phenotypic changes: 1) an increase in protein synthesis; 2) an increase in myocyte size; 3) increased organization of contractile protein actin into sarcomeric units; 4) enhanced expression of embryonic genes β-MHC and ANF. Our data demonstrate that the ERK pathway is essential to the hypertrophic responses of myocytes to GPCR agonists, ET-1 and PE. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes from 1- to 2-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared by the method reported previously (21Yue T.L. Wang C. Gu J.L. Ma X.L. Kumar S. Lee J.C. Feuerstein G.Z. Thomas H. Maleeff B. Ohlstein E.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 692-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The myocytes were purified on a discontinuous Percoll gradient, suspended in a plating media containing 10% serum, and plated in Laminin Cellware 24-well plates (Becton Dickson) or Permanox™ Lab-Tek chamber slides coated with laminin for 24 h. The media was then replaced with a serum-free maintenance media and incubated for 24 h before being used for study. The purity of cardiomyocytes assessed by immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody against sarcomeric α-actinin (Sigma) was above 95%. Cardiomyocytes cultured in 24-well plates were treated with vehicle or U0126 (Promega, Madison, WI) or SB-386013 (SmithKline Beecham, King of Prussia, PA) for 30 min, stimulated with ET-1 or PE for 24 h in serum-free medium, and then incubated in the same medium with 1.0 μCi/ml [3H]leucine for an additional 6 h. The radioactivity incorporated into the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was determined. The [3H]leucine incorporation in the cells treated with ET-1 or PE alone was normalized 100% (14Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). MAPK activities were assayed as described previously (22Yue T.L. Ni J. Romanic A.M. Gu J.L. Keller P. Wang C.

The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for ERK1/2 (sc-154-G; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p38 (sc-535-G; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and JNK1/2 (sc-474-G; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and were assayed by using myelin basic protein for ERK, glutathione S-transferase-activating transcription factor-2 for p38, and glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun(1–81) for JNK as the substrate, respectively. Cardiac myocyte cultured on chamber slides (2.5 105 cells/well) were fixed and immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against sarcomeric α-actinin (Sigma) (23Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richadson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1999; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2205) Google Scholar) as described below. Planimetry was performed using Image-Pro software. At least 300 cells per slide were scored for size measurement. The cell surface area in control cells was normalized 100% (basal), and results were expressed as the -fold change in cell size compared with the basal level (24Sekiguchi K. Yokoyama T. Kurabayashi M. Okajima F. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For staining of filamentous actin, the myocytes were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, washed with PBS, treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3–5 min, washed again, and incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, and then stained with Oregon Green 514 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) at 5 units/ml for 20 min at room temperature (25Aoki H.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The probe for ANF spanned a 216-base pair fragment of the rat ANF cDNA (accession number M27498). It was generated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from total RNA obtained from rat heart tissue. Specific primers ANF-512 (sense), 5′-GCC CCC GCT TCA TCG GTC TG-3′ and ANF-704 (antisense), 5′-CAG CAT GGG CTC CTT CTC CAT CAC-3′ were used to generate the cDNA fragment (27Kreutz R. Struk B. Rubattu S. Hubner N. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Ganten D. Lindpaintner K. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was prepared and separated as described previously (28Yue T.L. Wang X. Sung C.P. Olson B. McKenna P.J. Gu J.L. Feuerstein J.Z. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The blot was hybridized using [α-32p]dATP random prime-labeled rat ANF and rpL32 cDNA probes (a gift of Dr. R. P. Perry, Institute for Cancer Research, Fox Chase, PA). Myocytes cultured in 24-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well were treated with vehicle or U0126 for 20 min prior to the addition of ET-1 or PE in serum-free medium for 24 h. The supernatants were collected for ANF assay using a ELISA kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc.) following the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were cultured on chamber slides. After treatment with vehicle or U0126 for 30 min the cells were stimulated with ET-1 (100 nm) or PE (50 μm) for 24 to 48 h, washed, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-rat ANF antiserum (Penninsula Laboratory), mouse anti-rat skeletal β-MHC, and mouse anti-rat sarcomeric α-actinin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). As a negative control, the cell samples were incubated with nonimmune IgG instead of the primary antibody. An anti-rabbit IgG biotinylated secondary antibody was used for ANF staining, and an anti-mouse IgG biotinylated secondary antibody was used for β-MHC and α-actinin staining (Vector Laboratory), respectively. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. The dominant-negative mutants of Raf (K375R), and GFP (pEGFP; CLONTECH) were subcloned into a shuttle vector containing the cytomegalovirus promotor/enhancer. Recombinant adenovirus was generated as described previously (19Hertig C.M. Kubalak S.W. Wang Y. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37362-37369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus was tested for transgene expression in cardiomyocytes by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, or kinase assays as described (20Wang Y. Su B. Sah V.P. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5423-5426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were infected with adenovirus-expressing dominant-negative Raf (AdRaf−) or adenovirus-expressing GFP (AdGFP) as control for 24 h. The cells were exposed to ET-1 (100 nm) or PE (50 μm) in serum-free medium for an additional 24–48 h before being fixed and stained with anti-actinin antibody (cell size measurement) or Oregon Green 514 phalloidin (sarcomere organization). Culture supernatants were collected for ANF assay as described above. All values in the text and figures are presented as mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments. Statistical evaluation was performed by using one-way analysis of variance with subsequent post hoc paired comparisons. Differences with a value of p < 0.05 were considered significant. ERK was rapidly activated in cardiomyocytes exposed to ET-1 (100 nm) or PE (50 μm), consistent with previous reports (6Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Andersson M.B. Clerk A. Lazou A. Marshall C.J.

The maximal ERK activity was observed at 5–10 min after exposure, and the -fold increase over the basal was 5.9 ± 0.7 (ET-1) or 4.9 ± 0.5 (PE), respectively (n = 5). Two subfamily members of the MAPK family, p38 and JNK were also activated by ET-1 or PE but to a lesser degree than that of ERK activation. In the presence of 100 nm ET-1, the peak increase (-fold) in p38 and JNK activity was 2.3 ± 0.5 and 3.9 ± 0.6, respectively (n = 4). Similar results were also observed in the cells treated with 50 μm PE. ET-1- and PE-induced activation of ERK in cardiomyocytes was inhibited by U0126 with IC50 values of 1.3 μm (Fig.1 A) and 1.4 μm(Fig. 1 B), respectively (n = 4). U0126 had no effect on ET-1- or PE-induced activation of p38 or JNK.Figure 5Effects of U0126 on ET-1 - or PE-induced ANF expression in cardiomyocytes. Lower panel, immunohistochemical analysis.

Cells were harvested, extracted, and ERK, p38, and JNK were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of U0126 on ET-1- or PE-stimulated protein synthesis was analyzed by measurement of [3H]leucine incorporation into the myocytes as shown in Fig. 2. In cells exposed to ET-1 (100 nm) or PE (50 μm) for 24 h, [3H]leucine uptake was increased by 2.6 ± 0.2- and 2.8 ± 0.4-fold (n = 5) over the basal, respectively, and inhibited by U0126 with IC50 values of 1.7 (ET-1) and 1.1 μm (PE), respectively. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with ET-1 (100 nm) or PE (50 μm) for 48 h resulted in an increase in cell size (-fold) by 2.5 ± 0.3 and 3.0 ± 0.2 compared with the control, respectively, (p < 0.01, n = 5). U0126 inhibited ET-1- or PE-induced increase in myocyte size with IC50 values of 1.3 μm (ET-1) and 1.9 μm (PE), respectively (Fig. 3). U0126 treatment alone had no effect on cell size (data not shown). Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes cultured in serum-free condition displayed thin and rudimentary sarcomeric structure (Fig.4 A), and treatment of myocytes with 100 nm ET-1 or 50 μm PE caused a reorganization of sarcomere with highly organized actin fibers as shown by the brightly stained straight, thick bundles when the cells were stained for polymerized actin by phalloidin. (Fig. 4, Band C). However, pre-treatment of myocytes with U0126 (10 μm) abolished ET-1- or PE-induced sarcomere reorganization (Fig. 4, D and E). The effect of U0126 on ERK pathway in modulating the induction of ANF in response to ET-1 or PE in myocytes was examined by the following three different assays: 1) Detection of ANF mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis. The basal level of ANF mRNA was detected in myocytes as reported previously (24Sekiguchi K. Yokoyama T. Kurabayashi M. Okajima F. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 1000-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In myocytes treated with ET-1 (100 nm) or PE (50 μm) for 24 h, the expression of ANF mRNA was markedly enhanced. In the presence of U0126 (10 μm), however, ET-1- or PE-induced ANF mRNA expression was remarkably attenuated (data not shown). 2) Detection of ANF protein expression by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 5, lower panel). Expression of ANF protein in myocytes was markedly enhanced by the treatment of cells with ET-1 (100 nm) or PE (50 μm) for 24 h. ANF-positive cells showed a characteristic perinuclear staining pattern, consistent with that reported previously (13Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 30Hoshijima M. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7725-7730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the presence of U0126 (10 μm), ET-1- or PE-induced ANF expression was markedly reduced. 3) Measurement of ANF levels in the medium by ELISA (Fig. 5,upper panel). A detectable level of ANF (18.7 ± 3.2 ng/ml, n = 4) was found in the medium of untreated myocytes and was increased approximately 3-fold in the presence of 100 nm ET-1 or 50 μm PE for 24 h. (51.4 ± 4.9 and 64.4 ± 7.1 ng/ml, respectively, p < 0.01 versus basal, n = 4), indicating an enhanced production of ANF from the cells. U0126 reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, ET-1- and PE-induced elevation of ANF levels in the culture medium with IC50 values of 1.0 and 1.3 μm, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, expression of β-MHC in cardiomyocytes was significantly enhanced when cells were treated with ET-1 (100 nm) or PE (50 μm) for 24 h. However, in the presence of U0126 (10 μm), ET-1- or PE-stimulated expression of β-MHC in myocytes was markedly reduced. The similar inhibitory effects of SB-386023 on ET-1- or PE-induced hypertrophic responses in myocytes were demonstrated, and the data with ET-1 are mainly presented. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with 10 μm SB-386023 for 20 min prior to the addition of ET-1 (100 nm) abrogated ET-1-induced activation of ERK without affecting activation of p38 or JNK (Fig.7 A). In the presence of SB-386023, ET-1-induced increase in [3H]leucine incorporation was reduced (IC50 = 1.4 μm) (Fig. 7 B). SB-386023 inhibited ET-1 (100 nm)- or PE (50 μm)-induced cell size increase with IC50 values of 1.9 and 2.0 μm, respectively (Fig. 7 C). A representative photograph with ET-1 stimulation is presented in Fig. 7 D. Moreover, ET-1-induced increased organization of contractile protein actin into sarcomeric units (Fig.7 E) and expression of β-MHC (Fig. 7 F) and ANF protein (Fig. 7 G) in cardiomyocytes were all attenuated in the presence of SB-386023. More than 95% of cardiomyocytes were positive for GFP expression after incubation of cells with AdGFP for 24 h under the experimental condition. Transfection of cells with AdGFP had no effect on PE- or ET-1-induced cell size increase. However, in cardiomyocytes infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding the dominant inhibitory mutant of Raf (AdRaf−), PE- or ET-1-induced increase in cell size was inhibited (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 8,upper panel, ET-1-induced increase in sarcomeric reorganization was inhibited in myocytes transfected with AdRaf− but not in cells infected with AdGFP. Moreover, ET-1- or PE-induced ANF production was markedly inhibited in myocytes infected with AdRaf− but not with AdGFP (Fig. 8, lower panel). U0126 is a recently discovered selective MEK inhibitor with IC50 values that are 350-fold higher for inhibiting JNK and p38 than for ERK. It has no effect on protein kinase C, Cdk2, or Cdk4 (17Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A.

Our data (Fig. 1) have confirmed the selective ERK inhibition by U0126 in cultured cardiomyocytes. Besides its selectivity for ERK pathway, U0126 has two important features, better potency and solubility compared with PD98059. The compound displays significantly higher affinities than PD98059 for the MEK·ERK complex and the free MEK enzyme; therefore it is at least 10-fold more potent than PD98059 in inhibiting ERK activation (17Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, U0126 reduced ET-1- or PE-stimulated increase in cell size and protein synthesis with IC50 values between 1 and 2 μm. Our results demonstrate that ET-1- or PE-induced myofibrillar organization in cardiomyocytes was remarkably inhibited by U0126, consistent with previous studies that demonstrated a positive link between the ERK activation and the enhanced myofibrillar reorganization (12Clerk A. Micheal A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and the inhibitory effect of PD98059 (50 μm) on sarcomeric reorganization (16Jette C. Thorburn A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our data are in contrast with another study in which myocytes treated with 2-aminopurine or 6-thioguanine failed to block PE-induced organization of actin in myocytes (10Thorburn J. Frost J.A. Thorburn A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PE-induced activation of ERK was not completely inhibited by the either pharmacological reagents. In addition, it is unclear whether those two reagents specifically affected the ERK cascade. The present study also demonstrated that blockade of ERK activation by U0126 inhibits ET-1- or PE-induced expression of β-MHC and ANF in myocytes. There have been conflicting conclusions regarding the role of ERK activation in the regulation of ANF expression. To carefully examine the effect of U0126 on ET-1- or PE-stimulated ANF expression in myocytes, three methods for the detection of ANF were used in this study. Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes express basal levels of ANF that were variable from one preparation to another as reported previously (13Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Sekiguchi K. Yokoyama T. Kurabayashi M. Okajima F. Nagai R. Circ.

Cardiol. 1998; 30: 55-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, data from the three different assays clearly demonstrate that inhibition of ERK pathway by U0126 attenuated ANF expression in myocytes exposed to ET-1 or PE. Our data disagree with a previous study in which transient transfection of dominant-negative ERK mutant or treatment of myocytes with PD98059 failed to block PE-stimulated ANF reporter gene expression in cardiomyocytes (13Post G.R. Goldstein D. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This may be due to the lack of sensitivity of the ANF reporter gene system to inhibition, which could be a result of a low transfection efficiency associated with transient transfection. Another reason could be due to the fact that a low dose of PD98059 (10 μm) was used in that study that might be insufficient as it has been reported that PD98059 only at 50 μmcompletely inhibited ET-1-induced ERK activation in cardiomyocytes (14Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A recent study showed different effects on ANF expression by PD98059, and ANF activation was only affected at higher concentrations of the inhibitor (15Fuller S.J. Gillespie-Brown J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18146-18152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is notable that PD98059 tends to be insoluble at or above 50 μm, making the study using a higher concentration of PD98059 difficult. The difference in the potency and solubility between U0126 and PD98059 could be an important consideration to explain the discrepancy regarding the effects of ERK inhibition on myocyte hypertrophy among different laboratories. Our data clearly demonstrate that all observed hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes in this study were inhibited or attenuated by U0126. There are limitations in previous studies using the transient transfection protocol to block Ras and define the role of ERK pathway in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (8Thorburn A. Thorburn J. Chen S.Y. Powers S. Shubeita H.E. Feramisco J.R. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2244-2249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hunter J.J. Tanaka N. Rockman H.A. Ross Jr., J. Chien K.R. J. Biol.

Interpretation of these results may be hampered by the fact that Ras has at least three major effectors, namely, Raf, PI3K, and Ral-guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator besides ERK activation (32Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 33Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 34Hagemann C. Rapp U.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and transfection of the dominant-negative Ras mutant has been found to inhibit PI3K activity (35Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Because expression of c-Raf and A-Raf in cardiac myocytes has been demonstrated (36Bogoyevitch M.A. Marshall C.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the present study used a new potent and selective Raf inhibitor, SB-386023, to further define the role of ERK pathway in ET-1- and PE-induced myocyte hypertrophy. This compound has been demonstrated to inhibit both c-Raf and B-Raf at 1–10 μm in a variety of cellular assays, without affecting JNK or p38 (18Hughes, J. P., Staton, P., Wilkinson, M. G., Kee, W. J., Strijbos, P. J. L. M., Skaper, S. D., and Reith, A. D. (2000) Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int.(Abstr. 1568).Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 A, SB-386023 inhibited ET-1-stimulated ERK activation in a concentration-dependent manner but had no effect on p38 or JNK, and activation of ERK was almost completely inhibited at 10 μm. All observed hypertrophic responses of myocytes to ET-1 or PE were significantly blocked in a dose-dependent manner by SB-386023 (Fig. 7,B–G). The data are in agreement with that obtained with U0126, indicating that the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway plays a critical role in myocyte hypertrophy. We further performed the transfection study using adenovirus-mediated transfection of AdRaf−. To avoid adenovirus-mediated nonspecific changes in cellular morphology or gene expression associated with myocyte hypertrophy, we carefully titrated the adenovirus stock and determined the optimal m.o.i. Infection of myocytes with AdRaf− but not adenovirus alone blocked ET-1- and PE-induced increase in cell size and sarcomeric reorganization. In addition, ET-1- or PE-induced production of ANF was significantly reduced in myocytes infected with AdRaf− but not AdGFP. These results are consistent with the data from the study with Raf inhibitor, SB-386023, and MEK inhibitor, U0126. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway blocked all observed hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes exposed to ET-1 or PE. Although the involvement of other signaling pathways in cardiac hypertrophy is possible, the present results strongly support the notion that the ERK cascade plays an essential role in the signaling mechanisms that lead to the development of myocardial hypertrophy.

https://openalex.org/W2003243970,"Neurons in the rostral lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus (TEs), part of the inferior temporal cortex, respond selectively to three-dimensional (3D) shapes. We have investigated how these neurons represent disparity-defined 3D structure. Most neurons were selective for either first-order (disparity gradients) or second-order (disparity curvature) disparities. The latter selectivity proved remarkably vulnerable to disparity discontinuities, such as sharp edges or steps in disparity. The majority of the neurons remained selective for small disparity variations within the stimulus. 3D shape selectivity was preserved when the frontoparallel position or the stimulus size was altered. Thus, in TEs, 3D shape is coded by first- and second-order disparity-selective neurons, which are highly sensitive to spatial variations of disparity."
https://openalex.org/W2012301429,"Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) regulates a vast number of cellular functions. An important target for PKA in brain and heart is the class CL-type Ca2+ channel (Cav1.2). PKA phosphorylates serine 1928 in the central, pore-forming α1C subunit of this channel. Regulation of channel activity by PKA requires a proper balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. For fast and specific signaling, PKA is recruited to this channel by an protein kinase A anchor protein (Davare, M. A., Dong, F., Rubin, C. S., and Hell, J. W. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 30280–30287). A phosphatase may be associated with the channel to effectively balance serine 1928 phosphorylation by channel-bound PKA. Dephosphorylation of this site is mediated by a serine/threonine phosphatase that is inhibited by okadaic acid and microcystin. We show that immunoprecipitation of the channel complex from rat brain results in coprecipitation of PP2A. Stoichiometric analysis indicates that about 80% of the channel complexes contain PP2A. PP2A directly and stably binds to the C-terminal 557 amino acids of α1C. This interaction does not depend on serine 1928 phosphorylation and is not altered by PP2A catalytic site inhibitors. These results indicate that the PP2A-α1C interaction constitutively recruits PP2A to the channel complex rather than being a transient substrate-catalytic site interaction. Functional assays with the immunoisolated class C channel complex showed that channel-associated PP2A effectively reverses serine 1928 phosphorylation by endogenous PKA. Our findings demonstrate that both PKA and PP2A are integral components of the class C L-type Ca2+ channel that determine the phosphorylation level of serine 1928 and thereby channel activity.

It is deleted by calpain-mediated proteolytic cleavage upon Ca2+influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptors in neurons, which results in the 180-kDa short form of α1C (17Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E.

This modification is permanent in contrast to that by PKA-mediated phosphorylation, which is readily reversed by protein phosphatases. The phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid increased the PKA-stimulated activity of class C channels ectopically expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (11Sculptoreanu A. Rotman E. Takahashi M.

Disruption of PKA binding to AKAPs prevents PKA-mediated regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (23Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L.

Phosphorylation of α1C by PKA is observed when wt AKAP79 but not when a PKA binding-deficient mutant of AKAP79 is co-expressed with the class C channel in HEK293 cells (16Gao T. Yatani A.

Furthermore, PKA is associated with α1C in the brain and this interaction may be mediated by the microtubule-associated protein MAP2B (15Davare M.A. Dong F. Rubin C.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data indicate that PKA anchoring at α1C is essential for efficient phosphorylation of the channel. Previous studies suggest that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of α1C counteract each other in a dynamic way (11Sculptoreanu A. Rotman E. Takahashi M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We hypothesized that a phosphatase has to be localized at or near the channel for effective reversal of channel phosphorylation. In fact, run-down of class C channel activity in inside-out patches excised from ventricular myocytes was greatly slowed by okadaic acid (26Ono K. Fozzard H.A. J. Physiol. 1992; 454: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These results indicate that a phosphatase was attached to the patch, possibly through a direct interaction with the channel complex. We found that the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A is associated with the class CL-type channel, reversing phosphorylation of α1C by PKA. The PKA inhibitory peptide PKI (5–24) was a gift from Dr. L. M. Graves (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The ECL detection kit and protein G-Sepharose were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, microcystin LR and okadaic acid from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), and purified catalytic subunit of PKA and protein A-Sepharose from Sigma. [3H]PN200-100 (2948 GBq/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and digitonin from Gallard-Schlesinger (Carle Place, NY).

To study the effect of okadaic acid on α1C phosphorylation in cell culture, HEK293 cells stably transfected with the β2-adrenergic receptor (34Seibold A. January B.G. Friedman J. Hipkin R.W.

Cells were lysed and used for immunoprecipitation with anti-α1C and immunoblotting with anti-CH1923–1932P and anti-α1C antibodies to determine the phosphorylation status of serine 1928. All extracts contained the protease inhibitors pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (20 μg/ml), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (200 nm), and calpain inhibitor I and II (8 μg/ml each). Crude membrane fractions were prepared from rat brain as described (15Davare M.A. Dong F. Rubin C.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30280-30287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the cytosolic fraction saved as a source of native PP2A for in vitrointeraction assays with α1C-derived GST fusion proteins. Membranes and HEK293 cells were extracted with solubilization buffer, and insoluble material removed by ultracentrifugation. After preincubation with Sepharose CL-4B to remove proteins that nonspecifically bind to the resin, extracts (0.5 ml) were incubated on ice with either 10 μg of affinity-purified anti-α1Cantibody, 10 μg of control rabbit IgG, 2 μl of anti-GluR1 or anti-AKAP150 antiserum, or 0.3 μl of anti-HA tag ascites. After 1.5 h, 3–5 mg of protein A-Sepharose were added, samples tilted for 2.5 h, and the resins washed and extracted with 20 μl of SDS sample buffer before immunoblotting as described (2Hell J.W.

All experiments were performed at least three times with comparable results. Class C channels were quantitatively labeled with theL-type channel-specific ligand [3H]PN200-100 and solubilized with digitonin, which preserves the binding of the ligand to the L-type channels, as described (2Hell J.W.

Briefly, crude membrane fractions were prepared in the absence of EGTA and EDTA and incubated with a saturating concentration of [3H]PN200-100 (25 nm) for 1 h on ice in the dark. Membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation and channels solubilized for 20 min on ice with 1.5% digitonin, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors plus 1,10-phenanthroline (200 μg/ml). Non-soluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 20 μg of affinity-purified anti-α1C antibody or control IgG from rabbit. Immunoresins were washed and split into equal portions. One portion was used for scintillation counting to determine the amount of [3H]PN200-100 and the other portion for immunoblotting with antibodies against PP2A/C. In parallel, increasing amounts of affinity-purified GST-PP2A/C (see next paragraph) was loaded onto the same gel (the protein concentration of PP2A was determined with a BCA protein assay from Pierce). The amount of class C channel present in each immunoprecipitate was calculated from the values obtained by scintillation counting (counting efficiency was about 40% in our hands) after subtracting the amount of [3H]PN200-100 nonspecifically precipitated with the control IgG (about 5% of the quantity obtained by immunoprecipitation with anti-α1C). We also took into account the off rate for channel-associated [3H]PN200-100 (t12 is about 3 h under our conditions; data not shown). The amount of PP2A/C that coprecipitated with class C channels was determined by matching the PP2A/C immunosignal intensity present in the channel precipitates with signals from the GST-PP2A/C titration curve. α1C and PP2A/C-encoding cDNA templates (31Wadzinski B.E.

PP2A/C forward primers were 5′GC GGA TCC GAT ATC ATG TAT CCA TAT GAT GTT CC3′ (for HA tag) and 5′GC GGA TCC GGT ACC ATG GAC GAG AAG GTG TTC ACC3′ (untagged), and the reverse primer was 5′GCG TCG ACA AGC TTA CAG GAA GTA GTC TGG3′. PCR fragments were cloned into the TA cloning vector PCR.1 (Invitrogen), and inserts were excised withBamHI/EcoRI and subcloned into pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pTrcHisA (Invitrogen). DNA sequences were confirmed by PCR sequencing with the AmpliTaq system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Plasmids for the GST fusion proteins CT1507–1733 and CT1509–1622 were created as described (37Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Bunemann M. Puri T.S. Adair A. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

One sample serving as the zero time point for dephosphorylation by the endogenous phosphatase was immediately washed with radioimmunoassay buffer (15Davare M.A. Dong F. Rubin C.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol.

Mn2+ (1 mm), which increases the activity of several phosphatases including PP2A in vitro, and, when indicated, protamine (1 mg/ml, final concentration) and okadaic acid (2 nm) were added. Samples were incubated for 2.5 or 40 min as before, washed with radioimmunoassay buffer, extracted with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-CH1923–1932P and subsequently with anti-α1C. For phosphorylation of GST-CT1584–2140, this fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated in phosphorylation buffer containing 0.5–1 μg of the purified catalytic subunit of PKA and 50 μm ATP. After washing with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, it was used in parallel with unphosphorylated GST-CT1584–2140 for pull-down experiments of PP2A out of brain cytosol. An HEK293 cell line stably expressing the wt β2-adrenergic receptor (34Seibold A. January B.G. Friedman J. Hipkin R.W. Clark R.B. J. Biol.

Serine 1928 is the main if not only phosphorylation site for PKA on α1C. Phosphorylation of this site was determined after immunoprecipitation of class C channels with anti-α1C by immunoblotting with anti-CH1923–1932P (15Davare M.A. Dong F. Rubin C.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30280-30287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cultures with 100 nm okadaic acid significantly increased the level of serine 1928 phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). The extent of this increase was comparable to that induced by stimulation of the β2-adrenergic receptor with 10 μmisoproterenol. These data suggest that phosphorylation by PKA and dephosphorylation by an okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase of α1C are in a dynamic equilibrium that is influenced by inhibition of the phosphatase or stimulation of PKA. Okadaic inhibits the serine/threonine phosphatases PP2A (IC50: ∼0.1 nm), PP1 (IC50: ∼10 nm), and also, though much less potently, PP2B (calcineurin; IC50: ∼5 μm) (41Cohen P.

Microcystin inhibits these phosphatases with similar potencies (43Honkanen R.E. Zwiller J. Moore R.E. Daily S.L. Khatra B.S. Dukelow M. Boynton A.L. J. Biol.

Immunoblotting with anti-CH1923–1932P shows that serine 1928 is completely dephosphorylated when α1C is immunoisolated from Triton X-100 extracts of rat brain membranes lacking phosphatase inhibitors; however, if microcystin is present, phosphorylation is preserved (Fig. 1 B). This result demonstrates that a microcystin-sensitive phosphatase in the brain extract is responsible for the dephosphorylation of α1C. Therefore, we investigated whether PP1, PP2A, or, although less likely, PP2B is associated with the class C channel. Immunoprecipitation of this channel from Triton X-100 extracts of rat cerebral cortex resulted in specific coprecipitation of PP2A (Fig. 2 A) but not of PP1 or PP2B (Fig. 2, B and C). The specificity of this coprecipitation is indicated by the absence of any PP2A immunoreactivi"

To identify potential EGR1 target genes in an unbiased manner, we have utilized adenovirus-mediated expression of EGR1 in a prostate cancer cell line to identify specific genes that are induced by EGR1. Using oligonucleotide arrays, a number of EGR1-regulated genes were identified and their regulation was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis. One of the largest gene classes identified in this screen includes several neuroendocrine-associated genes (neuron-specific enolase, neurogranin), suggesting that EGR1 overexpression may contribute to the neuroendocrine differentiation that often accompanies prostate cancer progression. This screen also identified several growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-II, platelet-derived growth factor-A, and transforming growth factor-β1, which have previously been implicated in enhancing tumor progression. The insulin-like growth factor-II gene lies within the 11p15.5 chromosomal locus, which contains a number of other imprinted genes, and EGR1 expression was found to induce at least two other genes in this locus (IPL, p57KIP2). Based on our results, coupling adenoviral overexpression with microarray and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses could be a versatile strategy for identifying target genes of transactivators. The EGR1 transactivator is overexpressed in prostate cancer, and its expression pattern suggests that EGR1 could potentially regulate a number of steps involved in initiation and progression of prostate cancer, such as mitogenesis, invasiveness, angiogenesis, and metastasis.

Therefore, transcriptional regulators constitute one of the most important classes of differentially expressed genes in cancer, as they are uniquely poised to coordinately regulate gene networks. For example, the protooncogene c-myccan be activated through gene amplification or dysregulation of tumor suppressor pathways, and is able to promote proliferation by activating the expression of many genes involved in cell cycle progression (1Grandori C. Eisenman R.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 177-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 2Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). To understand the physiological significance of this overexpression, it is imperative to identify target genes that become activated in response to such overexpression. Until recently, identifying target genes of specific transactivators has been impeded by the scarcity of promoter sequence data. However, even comprehensive genome sequence is insufficient to unambiguously identify target promoters, since many transactivators bind to cognate sequences that deviate considerably from consensus binding sites. Techniques such as DNA footprinting and reporter assays have been extremely useful in the analysis of suspected target promoters, but these techniques do not provide proof that a transactivator activates a given promoter in vivo. In addition, these methods are time-consuming and are not suited for efficient identification of novel target genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that at least two transcription factors, ETS2 and EGR1, are overexpressed in prostate cancer (3Liu A.Y. Corey E. Vessella R.L. Lange P.H. True L.D. Huang G.M.

Urol. 1996; 155: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The EGR1 transactivator was originally identified as an immediate-early gene that is rapidly induced in response to a variety of stimuli. More recently, several studies have focused attention on the role of EGR1 in coordinating responses to hypoxia and vascular injury. In these systems, EGR1 activates expression of tissue factor (which eventually triggers vascular fibrin deposition) and several growth factors such as PDGF-A,1 PDGF-B, TGF-β1, IGF-II, and bFGF (6Yan S.F. Zou Y.S. Gao Y. Zhai C. Mackman N. Lee S.L. Milbrandt J. Pinsky D. Kisiel W. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8298-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Bae S.K.

Oncog. 1996; 7: 101-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, many of these same factors have also been implicated in various stages of prostate tumor progression (e.g. angiogenesis, metastasis), adding further evidence that at least some steps of tumor progression are mechanistically related to wound healing and hypoxic responses (10Battegay E.J. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Although increased expression of several of these genes has been implicated in development and progression of prostate cancer (11Gold L.I. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1999; 10: 303-360PubMed Google Scholar, 12Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmayr C. Hittmair A. Zhang J. Thurnher M. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Prostate. 1996; 28: 392-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), it has not yet been established whether their up-regulation in this context is functionally linked to increased levels of transactivators such as EGR1. To determine the physiological significance of EGR1 overexpression in prostate cancer, we have developed a high-throughput screen for genes that are induced by EGR1. This strategy employs a recombinant adenovirus that expresses EGR1 in the LAPC4 prostate cancer cell line. Changes in gene expression are then analyzed using microarray technology, which has made it possible to simultaneously track changes in expression levels of thousands of genes. Finally, expression of the candidate target genes in primary prostate tumor specimens is rapidly determined using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Compared with reporter-based assays, a major advantage of this approach is that it measures the response of endogenous promoters in their native chromatin context. Using this strategy, we have identified several genes that are regulated by EGR1 overexpression. These include signaling proteins, transcription regulators, neuroendocrine proteins, and membrane-associated proteins involved in adhesion and signaling. These results not only illuminate the consequences of EGR1 overexpression in prostate cancer, but also provide a model for identifying target genes of specific transactivators in other types of cancer. LAPC4 human prostate carcinoma cells (13Klein K.A. Reiter R.E. Redula J. Moradi H. Zhu X.L. Brothman A.R. Lamb D.J. Marcelli M. Belldegrun A. Witte O.N. Sawyers C.L. Nat.

Sawyers, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA), were maintained in Iscove's growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Adenoviral recombinants were prepared essentially as described (14Ehrengruber M.U.

Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6858-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pAC adenoviral transfer plasmid and inserted by homologous recombination into the E1 region of adenovirus Ad5PacIGFP (14Ehrengruber M.U.

Ehrengruber M.U. Davidson N. Milbrandt J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As a negative control, we used an adenovirus (Ad5PacIGFP) expressing the Gal4 DNA-binding domain () fused to a mutant, nonfunctional form of the EGR1 R1 domain (EGR1 residues 269–304 with I293F mutation). LAPC4 cells were infected at a viral titer of 1 × 108plaque-forming units/ml for 2 h. Thereafter, cells were washed once with medium and then cultured for another 24 h. Examination of the cells for GFP expression revealed that each virus infected >90% of the cells. For the immunoblot analysis of Fig. 1, lysates from adenovirus-infected cells were harvested 24 h after infection, resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Culture and stimulation of PC12 cells with NGF was performed as described previously, and the blot was probed with the 6H10 anti-EGR1 monoclonal antibody (17Day M.L. Fahrner T.J. Ayken S. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15253-15260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization probes for GeneChip analysis were prepared from poly(A)+ RNA prepared from cultures of LAPC4 cells that had been infected with either adenovirus expressing EGR1 (I293F) or the control adenovirus. The poly(A)+ RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer containing the T7 promoter, and this was used to prepare biotinylated cRNA using the Bioarray HighYield kit (Enzo) according to the manufacturer's directions. The biotinylated cRNA probes were fragmented and applied as described (18Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L.

Genet. 1999; 21 Suppl.: 20-24Crossref Scopus (1868) Google Scholar) to individual oligonucleotide HuGeneFL GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix), which contain probe sets for 5600 human genes. The signal intensities from hybridized cRNA were quantified, and the GeneChip analysis software was used to identify differentially expressed genes. Total RNA was purified, and 1 μg was used to prepare cDNA (20Lee S.L. Wang Y. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4566-4572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed by monitoring in real time the increase in fluorescence of the SYBR Green dye as described (21Wittwer C.T. Herrmann M.G. Moss A.A. Rasmussen R.P. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 22Morrison T.B. Weis J.J. Wittwer C.T. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 954-962PubMed Google Scholar) using the TaqMan 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For comparison of transcript levels between samples, a standard curve of cycle thresholds for several serial dilutions of a cDNA sample was established and then used to calculate the relative abundance of each gene. Values were then normalized to the relative amounts of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, which were obtained from a similar standard curve. All PCR reactions were performed in duplicate. Sequences of primers used for PCR analysis are available upon request. Prostate tissue specimens, derived from radical prostatectomy, were obtained from the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center Tissue Procurement Core Facility at Washington University. All samples had a Gleason grade of 3 + 3 (23Bostwick D.G. Bostwick D.G. Eble J.N. Urologic Surgical Pathology. Mosby, Saint Louis1997: 343-422Google Scholar). Guided by hematoxylin and eosin-stained frozen sections, the tissue blocks were grossly dissected so that, by visual estimate, the epithelial component of the isolated tissue contained at least 75% carcinoma cells. The tissues were sectioned at 50 μm on the cryostat microtome and used for RNA isolation. A serial frozen section was stained to verify that the tissue sections used for RNA preparation were predominantly carcinoma. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed as described above, with the exception that 18 S rRNA was used to normalize for the amount of input cDNA. Detection of IGF-II imprinting in human samples was performed as described (24Tadokoro K. Fujii H. Inoue T. Yamada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6967Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Jarrard D.F. Bussemakers M.J. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1471-1478PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhan S. Shapiro D. Zhang L. Hirschfeld S. Elassal J. Helman L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27983-27986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA from LAPC4 cells was isolated and amplified using two primers that span an IGF-II gene segment that contains a single nucleotide polymorphism. Sequencing of both strands of the PCR fragment revealed that LAPC4 DNA is heterozygous for this polymorphism. To determine which allele is induced by EGR1 expression, cDNA from LAPC4 cells infected with adenovirus expressing EGR1 I293F was amplified with the same primers, and this product was sequenced. Previous work has shown that the EGR1 transactivator is overexpressed in a majority of prostate cancers (4Eid M.A. Kumar M.V. Iczkowski K.A. Bostwick D.G. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2461-2468PubMed Google Scholar, 5Thigpen A.E. Cala K.M. Guileyardo J.M. Molberg K.H. McConnell J.D. Russell D.W. J. Urol. 1996; 155: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To identify genes that are regulated by EGR1, we wished to achieve overexpression of EGR1 in a prostate cell line without using stimuli (e.g. growth factors) that would activate signaling pathways and induce other transcription factors. Therefore, we utilized a recombinant adenovirus that expresses EGR1 (I293F), a mutant that is resistant to repression by endogenous NAB transcriptional corepressors (27Russo M.W. Sevetson B.R. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6873-6877Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 28Svaren J. Sevetson B.R. Apel E.D. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3545-3553Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which could repress any activation by wild type EGR1. The recombinant adenovirus was used to infect the LAPC4 prostate cell line. This cell line was derived as an explant of metastatic prostate cancer, and retains many of the characteristics of normal prostate cells such as prostate- specific antigen expression and androgen dependence (13Klein K.A. Reiter R.E. Redula J. Moradi H. Zhu X.L. Brothman A.R. Lamb D.J. Marcelli M. Belldegrun A. Witte O.N. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In addition to EGR1 (I293F), the adenovirus also expresses GFP from an independent transcription unit, which allows monitoring of infection. After infection with EGR1-expressing adenovirus, visualization by fluorescence microscopy confirmed that essentially all (>95%) of the cells in culture were infected. To determine if the level of EGR1 expression in adenovirus-infected cells is significantly higher than is ever observed physiologically, the expression level of EGR1 (I293F) created by the recombinant adenovirus (Fig. 1, lane 4 of inset) was compared with the induced level of EGR1 in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells (lane 2) (29Milbrandt J. Science. 1987; 238: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). This immunoblot reveals that use of recombinant adenovirus is an efficient means to target EGR1 overexpression to a cell line, and that the resulting level of EGR1 expression is comparable to the level of induced EGR1 observed in the NGF-treated PC12 system. The endogenous expression level of EGR1 in cultured LAPC4 cells is relatively low, at a level that is comparable to that observed in normal prostate tissue (data not shown). To test whether EGR1 (I293F) could activate potential target genes in this cell line, we measured expression levels of three EGR1 target genes that have been identified in other systems: IGF-II, PDGF-A, and TGF-β1 (30Lee Y.I. Kim S.J. DNA Cell. Biol. 1996; 15: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 31Dey B.R. Sukhatme V.P. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Kim S.J. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). After 24 h of infection, RNA was purified from these cultures and used to generate cDNA. We employed a technique for quantitative RT-PCR analysis, in which a fluorescent dye (SYBR Green) that binds double-stranded DNA is used to quantitate the amount of amplicon as it accumulates during the PCR reaction (22Morrison T.B. Weis J.J. Wittwer C.T. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 954-962PubMed Google Scholar, 35Schneeberger C. Speiser P. Kury F. Zeillinger R.

For each cDNA sample, we measured the cycle number at which PCR product accumulation reaches a defined threshold. Then, the relative levels of gene expression were determined using a standard curve obtained from assays of serial dilutions of a cDNA sample containing the gene of interest. To control for genes induced by adenovirus infection alone, expression levels of these three genes in EGR1-infected LAPC4 cells were compared with those obtained in LAPC4 cells infected with a control adenovirus. As shown in Fig. 1 B, IGF-II, TGF-β1, and PDGF-A were all induced in response to EGR1 expression, indicating for the first time that these genes, in their endogenous loci, are induced by EGR1 in a prostate cell type. The same cDNA samples used in Fig. 1 were used to prepare biotinylated cRNA targets, which were then hybridized to individual oligonucleotide HuGeneFL GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix), which contain probe sets for 5600 human genes. The signal intensities from hybridized cRNA were quantified as described (18Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2818) Google Scholar, 19Lipshutz R.J. Fodor S.P. Gingeras T.R. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21 Suppl.: 20-24Crossref Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). Using the default parameters of the GeneChip analysis software, 37% and 33% of the genes on the HuGeneFL array were scored as being present (or marginal) in the control-infected and EGR1 (I293F) expressing LAPC4 cells, respectively. The normalization factor used to compare the two data sets indicated that the global levels of hybridization from the two cRNA samples were roughly equivalent. Using defined copy numbers of synthetic, biotinylated cRNA transcripts that were added to the hybridization mixture, we estimate that the detection threshold in this experiment was approximately 5–10 copies/cell. The GeneChip data was first used to identify genes that are abundantly expressed in this cell line, since this profile may provide information regarding potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in prostate cancer. A list of the 50 most highly expressed genes (excluding genes for ribosomal proteins) in TableI contains several genes that have previously been associated with various types of tumors. For example, the thymosin β-10 protein binds and sequesters G-actin and is overexpressed in a wide range of tumor types (38Santelli G. Califano D. Chiappetta G. Vento M.T. Bartoli P.C. Zullo F. Trapasso F. Viglietto G. Fusco A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, CD81, a cell-surface molecule involved in cell adhesion and integrin signaling (39Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), is also expressed at a high level. Neuroleukin is a multifunctional protein that is a phosphoglucose isomerase, but also functions as a tumor-secreted cytokine that regulates invasion and metastasis (40Watanabe H. Takehana K. Date M. Shinozaki T. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2960-2963PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of the high expression levels of these proteins in the LAPC4 cell line remains to be established, but similar analyses of other prostate cancer models may substantiate their overexpression as a general characteristic of prostate cancer.Table IHighly expressed genes in LAPC4 cellsAccession no.DescriptionAccession no.DescriptionX00351β-ActinM24485GlutathioneS-transferaseU49869UbiquitinJ04617Elongation factor EF-1-αD78361Ornithine decarboxylase antizymeY00486Adenine phosphoribosyltransferaseM14199Laminin receptorAB002533Karyopherin α4X15341Cytochromec oxidase subunit ViaD38583CalgizzarinM17733Thymosin β-4S54005Thymosin β-10M33680CD81/TAPA-1J04823Cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIIU16660Peroxisomal enoyl-CoA hydrataseM19283γ-Actin geneX16064Histamine releasing factorL76200Guanylate kinase (GUK1)M24194Guanine nucleotide binding proteinK03515Neuroleukin/glucose phosphate isomeraseV00599β-TubulinD13748Eukaryotic initiation factor 4AIX95404Non-muscle type cofilinM55409Elongation factor 1γJ04173Phosphoglycerate mutaseD13413Scaffold attachment factor AD21261Transgelin 2X98482Troponin T2J03191ProfilinX56494Pyruvate kinaseU43901Laminin receptor precursorM21142Guanine nucleotide-binding proteinX02152Lactate dehydrogenase-AJ02683ADP/ATP carrier proteinX12447Aldolase AL26247Translation initiation factor SUI1X01677GAPDHD13118ATP synthase subunit cM11147Ferritin L chainD14710ATP synthase αX03689Elongation factor TUZ47055Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetaseX52851CyclophilinL19686Macrophage migration inhibitory factorX71973Glutathione peroxidase 4AJ001421Rer1 proteinM11353H3.3 histoneY07604Nucleoside-diphosphate kinaseU15008SnRNP D2D23662Ubiquitin-like proteinThe 50 highest expressed genes (excluding ribosomal proteins) derived from GeneChip analysis of the control LAPC4 sample are ranked in order of highest expression from upper left to lower right. Open table in a new tab The 50 highest expressed genes (excluding ribosomal proteins) derived from GeneChip analysis of the control LAPC4 sample are ranked in order of highest expression from upper left to lower right. Because we had observed up-regulation of several potential EGR1 target genes (Fig. 1) after expression of EGR1 (I293F), we used the GeneChip data sets to identify other genes that become induced as a consequence of EGR1 (I293F) expression. The average hybridization intensity across all probe sets using the cRNA prepared from LAPC4 cells expressing EGR1 I293F was normalized to that obtained from LAPC4 cells infected with a control virus. Comparison of the two data sets revealed that 144 of the genes found to be “present” in both samples (2.1% of total genes represented on the array) were induced in LAPC4 cells expressing EGR1 (I293F), but only 30 of these genes (0.5%) were induced more than 3-fold. Analysis of the results indicated several genes that were significantly altered in response to EGR1 overexpression (TableII), most of which had not previously been identified as EGR1 target genes. Many of the induced genes could be grouped into functional classes of molecules. These include transcriptional regulators, signaling molecules, as well as some neuroendocrine proteins. One signaling molecule was the Rad gene, a Ras homolog that was originally identified to be overexpressed in the muscle of patients with type II diabetes (41Reynet C. Kahn C.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1441-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). More recently, Rad expression has been shown to potentiate serum-stimulated DNA synthesis in a melanoma cell line. In addition, this activity of Rad is inhibited by the nm23 gene product, a putative suppressor of tumor metastasis (42Zhu J. Tseng Y.H. Kantor J.D. Rhodes C.J. Zetter B.R. Moyers J.S. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14911-14918Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). An example of the transcription factor group is CBF-β, the non-DNA-binding subunit of the heterodimeric transcription factor core-binding factor (CBF)/polyoma enhancer-binding protein 2. Chromosomal translocations involving the human CBF-β gene (CBF-β-MYH11) are associated with a large percentage of human leukemias (43Speck N.A. Terryl S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Exp. 1995; 5: 337-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Recently, CBF activity has been shown to be required for angiogenesis in an endothelial cell line, where expression of all CBF subunits is induced by angiogenic factors, such as bFGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (44Namba K. Abe M. Saito S. Satake M. Ohmoto T. Watanabe T. Sato Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The neuroendocrine genes are particularly interesting since neuroendocrine differentiation is often observed during prostate cancer progression.

In this report, we investigated the properties of the Dna2 helicase/endonuclease activities in search of their in vivo physiological functions in eukaryotes. We found that the Dna2 helicase activity translocates in the 5′ to 3′ direction and uses DNA with free ends as the preferred substrate. Furthermore, the endonucleolytic cleavage activity of Dna2 was markedly stimulated by the presence of an RNA segment at the 5′-end of single-stranded DNA and occurred within the DNA, ensuring the complete removal of the initiator RNA segment on the Okazaki fragment. In addition, we demonstrated that the removal of pre-existing initiator 5′-terminal RNA segments depended on a displacement reaction carried out during the DNA polymerase δ-catalyzed elongation of the upstream Okazaki fragments. These properties indicate that Dna2 is well suited to remove the primer RNA on the Okazaki fragment. Based op this information, we propose a new model in which Dna2 plays a direct role in Okazaki fragment maturation in conjunction with Fen-1.

The various steps in eukaryotic DNA synthesis are basically similar to those in prokaryotes, requiring many common enzymatic functions. Despite these striking similarities, certain eukaryotic replication components differ from the prokaryotic counterparts. Most noteworthy is that three essential DNA polymerases (pol)1 α, δ, and ε are required for DNA replication in eukaryotes (5Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 6Wang T.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 7Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In contrast, pol III is the only replicative enzyme in prokaryotes involved in DNA synthesis. Unlike its prokaryotic counterpart, the eukaryotic primase is complexed with DNA pol α. Thus, the role of the pol α-primase complex appears to function solely in the synthesis of a short RNA-DNA primer (referred to as primer DNA in this paper). The primer DNAs are then utilized by pol δ for the initiation of leading strand synthesis and by pol δ or pol ε for each Okazaki fragment synthesis for lagging strand DNA replication. The short and discontinuous Okazaki fragments at replication forks are processed and then joined to generate a continuous DNA strand through a series of complex enzymatic reactions that require a number of enzymes that include a 5′- to 3′-exonuclease (5Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 8Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Hendericksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). However, none of the eukaryotic polymerases possess intrinsic 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity for Okazaki fragment processing, unlike the well characterized prokaryotic polymerase, Escherichia coli DNA pol I (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). In the current model of replication in eukaryotes, Fen-1 provides the 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity, and with the assistance of RNase HI removes the RNA segments on Okazaki fragments (9Ishimi Y. Claude A. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19723-19733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Goulian M. Richards S.H. Heard C.J. Bigsby B.M. J. Biol.

RNase HI hydrolyzes the initiator RNA of the primer DNA leaving a single ribonucleotide at the RNA-DNA junction, which is subsequently removed by the 5′- to 3′-exonuclease activity of Fen-1. In mammalian cells, DNA pol δ, replication protein-A (RPA), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), replication factor-C (RFC), RNase HI, Fen-1, and DNA ligase I are necessary and sufficient to reconstitute lagging strand synthesisin vitro (11Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that Fen-1 contains a structure-specific endonuclease activity that cleaves the 5′-unannealed single-stranded (ss) DNA or RNA at the duplex junction (8Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Hendericksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 12Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R.

In addition, mammalian RNase HI can cleave 5′ of the last ribonucleotide of ssRNA-DNA hybrid molecules (15Murante R.S. Hendericksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2244-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Okazaki fragment maturation could occur through a more complex process than inferred previously. For example, Okazaki fragment maturation is likely to require formation of a 5′-tail prior to the action of Fen-1 and/or RNase HI, a process that is poorly understood at present. Although the role of Fen-1 and RNase HI in Okazaki fragment maturation has been well established in vitro, the phenotypes observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains lacking a gene for the yeast Fen-1 (yFen-1) or RNase HI (RAD27/RTH1 orRNH35, respectively) reveal that, unlike other genes whose products are essential for DNA replication, RAD27 andRNH35 are dispensable. RNase HI is a two-subunit enzyme (16Frank P. Braunshofer-Reiter C. Wintersberger U. Grimm R. Büsen W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12872-12877Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the deletion of its catalytic subunit did not affect cell viability (17Frank P. Braunshofer-Reiter C. Wintersberger U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Yeast strains carrying a deletion of RAD27are viable at 30 °C and compromised for growth at 37 °C, producing a yeast strain with a terminally arrested phenotype, an indication of a defect in DNA replication (18Sommers C.H.

J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 364-371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 30 °C, this strain shows elevated rates of spontaneous mutation, mitotic recombination, and chromosome loss (19Reagan M.S.

In support of these findings, Fen-1 has been shown to participate in long patch base excision repair in human cells (23DeMott M.S. Shen B. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. Zigman S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 96: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) in yeasts. Therefore, the viability of theRAD27-deleted yeast mutant strain is puzzling if yFen-1 is the only enzyme that plays such a crucial role in the completion of DNA replication. This is especially true considering that deletion from the yeast genome of the DNA ligase I gene, which is required for the joining of Okazaki fragments processed by Fen-1/RNase HI, renders cells inviable (31Nasmyth K.A. Cell. 1977; 12: 1109-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the viability of yeast cells lacking Fen-1 argues strongly for the existence of a more critical pathway for the in vivo processing of Okazaki fragments. Although Dna2 has been implicated in Okazaki fragment maturation on the basis of its genetic and physical interaction with yFen-1 (32Budd M.E. Campbell J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), its precise role in DNA replication remains unclear. Recently, we reported that Dna2 of S. cerevisiae contains a potent ssDNA-specific endonuclease activity (33Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In an attempt to define the role of Dna2 in yeast DNA replication, we have carried out genetic and biochemical studies to examine whether Dna2 participated in the maturation of Okazaki fragments. In this paper, we present evidence that Dna2 is well suited to remove completely the primer RNA on Okazaki fragments. Based on the biochemical studies presented here and genetic studies published elsewhere (34Kang H.Y. Choi E. Bae S.H. Lee K.H. Gim B.S. Kim H.D. Park C. MacNeill S.A. Seo Y.S. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we propose a novel model in which Dna2 plays a key role in the processing of Okazaki fragments.

Nuclease activities were barely detectable in this RFC preparation, and silver-stained gels revealed that the preparation was more than 95% pure (data not shown). The DNA substrates used to determine the directionality of Dna2 helicase movement were constructed as described previously (40Park J.S. Choi E. Lee S.H. Lee C. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18910-18919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with following modifications. The 3′-end of oligonucleotide 1 (52-nt oligomer) annealed to φX174 sscDNA (4 pmol) was first labeled by incorporating [α-32P]dCTP and then chased with excess unlabeled dCTP in the presence of Klenow fragment. The partial duplex region was then cleaved by HpaII to generate linear φX174 ssDNA. This procedure yielded a substrate labeled only at the 3′-end of the 29-nt fragment. To prepare a substrate labeled only at the 5′-end of the 23-nt fragment, oligonucleotide 1 (10 pmol) was labeled at the 5′-end in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed to 4 pmol of φX174 sscDNA, and then digested with HpaII. The various partial duplex substrates used to characterize the endonuclease activity of HX-Dna2 were prepared as described previously (33Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) using the synthetic oligonucleotides listed in Table I. Among the DNA substrates constructed, we examined whether the Y- and flap DNA substrates (5′-end labeled in their ssDNA tails) were cleaved by Fen-1 in order to confirm the presence of the desired specific structure. The 5′-tail of the Y substrate was resistant to Fen-1 as expected, whereas the flap substrate was cleaved by Fen-1 (data not shown). This result as well as the mobility change upon heat treatment during gel electrophoresis revealed that the substrates possessed a specific structure as intended. Standard reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 15 fmol of substrate (33Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H.

When necessary, ATP and/or Mg2+ were included as indicated. Early efforts to establish the polarity of translocation of the Dna2 helicase activity were hampered by its intrinsic endonuclease and weak helicase activities. We determined the DNA unwinding polarity of Dna2 by blocking the nuclease activity through using high ratios of ATP to Mg2+ (33Bae S.H. Choi E. Lee K.H. Park J.S. Lee S.H. Seo Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26880-26890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and by using a partial duplex DNA substrate that consisted of linear φX174 ssDNA containing a 29-nucleotide (nt) fragment at the 3′-end and a 23-nt fragment at the 5′-end (Fig.1). Due to its limited unwinding activity, the HX-Dna2 protein failed to produce ssDNA from the 52-base pair duplex DNA substrate (data not shown). In contrast, the enzyme displaced a shorter duplex region in the linearized substrate in the presence of ATP (Fig. 1, lanes 4–6). HX-Dna2 displaced the 29-nt fragment at the 3′-end but not the 23-nt fragment at the 5′-end (Fig. 1, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 11 and 12). This result indicates that Dna2 translocates in the 5′ to 3′ direction in contrast to the previous report that Dna2 translocated in the opposite direction (41Budd M.E. Campbell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In the previous report, the directionality of Dna2 was not experimentally determined. The directionality of Dna2 was inferred based upon the observation that it required a 5′-tailed forked substrate for unwinding activity (41Budd M.E. Campbell J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7642-7646Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). By using a purified recombinant nuclease-deficient Dna2 (42Lee K.H. Kim D.W. Bae S.H. Kim J.A. Ryu K.H. Kwon Y.N. Kim K.A. Koo H.S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), however, we found that Dna2 was not dependent on the presence of 5′-tailed fork structure for its unwinding activity (data not shown). Although the addition of a molar excess of ATP (2 mm) over Mg2+ (1 mm) reduced the ssDNA-specific endonuclease activity, it stimulated the release of the 3′-end label (Fig. 1, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lanes 5 and 6). This observation suggests that Dna2 endonuclease activity is likely to prefer ssDNA with free ends as substrate. For this reason, we examined the substrate specificity of the endonuclease activity of Dna2 by using three different DNA substrates that possessed either a 5′- or 3′-ssDNA overhang or ssDNA flanked by partial duplexed regions at both ends (Fig.2 A). The cleavage products were first analyzed using a low resolution gel for the convenience of precise quantification. The enzyme degraded the 5′-ssDNA tails most efficiently. The amount of the 5′-tail (69 nt) substrate cleaved with 0.5 ng of HX-Dna2 was 10.4 fmol (Fig. 2 A, lane 4), whereas the amount of 3′-tail (69 nt) substrate cleaved with the same amount of enzyme was slightly reduced (7.2 fmol) (Fig. 2 A, lane 10). We estimated that the efficiency of cleavage of the 5′-tail substrate by HX-Dna2 was about 2-fold greater than that of the 3′-tail (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and12). In contrast, cleavage of internal ssDNA regions flanked by partial duplexes at both ends was extremely poor (Fig. 2 A, lanes 16–18), requiring much higher enzyme levels (>200-fold) to accumulate comparable amounts of products. The addition of 100 ng of HX-Dna2 to the reaction resulted in the cleavage"

We found that this protein binds to three other Z-disc proteins; therefore, we have named it FATZ, γ-filamin/ABP-L, α-actinin andtelethonin binding protein of the Z-disc. From yeast two-hybrid experiments we are able to show that the SR3-SR4 domains of α-actinin 2 are required to bind the COOH-terminal region of the FATZ as does γ-filamin/ABP-L. Furthermore, by using a glutathione S-transferase overlay assay we find that FATZ also binds telethonin. The level of FATZ protein in muscle cells increases during differentiation, being clearly detectable before the onset of myosin. Although FATZ has no known interaction domains, it would appear to be involved in a complex network of interactions with other Z-band components. On the basis of the information known about its binding partners, we could envisage a central role for FATZ in the myofibrillogenesis. After screening our muscle expressed sequence tag data base and the public expressed sequence tag data bases, we were able to assemble two other muscle transcripts that show a high level of identity with FATZ in two different domains.

This supramolecular structure plays an important role in the regulation of contraction both in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Variation of the Z-disc structure is observed during development and differentiation of muscle cells and can be correlated with specific pathological or degenerative conditions associated with muscle injuries or atrophies. The number of different protein components of the Z-disc is far from being complete, and many of the newly discovered muscle proteins appear to be localized in this region, and very generally they can be divided into two groups based on their location. In the first group are proteins that are only partially in the Z-disc while extending into other portions of the sarcomere or the sarcolemma. An example of the first group is titin that acts as a ruler for the ordered distribution of sarcomeric proteins and is particularly important in Z-disc assembly. The NH2-terminal portion of titin extends into the Z-disc, where two different sub-domains have been shown to interact specifically with α-actinin (1Gautel M. Goulding D. Bullard B. Weber K.

Gautel M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although telethonin binds to the NH2-terminal domain of titin, it also acts as one of the substrates of the titin serine kinase domain that is located outside of the Z-disc (5Mayans O. van der Ven P. Wilm M. Mues A. Young P. Fürst D.O. Wilmanns M. Gautel M. Nature. 1998; 395: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The second group is composed of proteins, many of which have been recently discovered and characterized, that appear to be entirely located in the Z-disc (e.g. α-actinin, Nspl1, telethonin, ZASP1, and CapZ). Among these proteins, α-actinin plays a central role by directly cross-linking the actin molecules. There are four α-actinin genes, two non-skeletal muscle isoforms, actinin 1 and 4 (6Millake D.B. Blanchard A.D. Patel B. Critchley D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Honda K. Yamada T. Endo R. Ino Y. Gotoh M. Tsuda H. Yamada Y. Chiba H. Hirohashi S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and two skeletal muscle isoforms, actinin 2 and 3 (8Beggs A.H. Byers T.J. Knoll J.H. Boyce F.M. Bruns G.A. Kunkel L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9281-9288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The general structure of the skeletal muscle-specific α-actinin 2 can be divided in three functionally distinct domains as follows: the NH2-terminal region of 252 amino acids that mediates the interaction with the actin rod, a central region that is composed of four spectrin-like motifs, and finally, the COOH terminus that contains a calmodulin-like domain (9Castresana J. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Davison M.D. Critchley D.R. Cell. 1988; 52: 159-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In muscle the sarcomeric actinin isoforms are capable of forming both homodimers and heterodimers (11Chan Y. Tong H.Q. Beggs A.H. Kunkel L.M. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1998; 24: 134-139Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Structural studies have demonstrated that the dimer is organized with antiparallel orientation (12Dijovnoviæ-Carugo K. Young P. Gautel M. Saraste M. Cell. 1999; 98: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), held together by the internal spectrin-like repeats, whereas the NH2-terminal domains of the dimer cross-link two opposite actin molecules. In this paper we present the identification and functional characterization of a novel structural component of the Z-disc that is expressed at a very high level in adult skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent in heart, testis, and prostate. In muscle, this novel protein appears to be involved in a complex network of interactions with other Z-disc components despite the absence of known interaction domains. By using a variety of methodologies, we demonstrate the specific interaction of this novel protein with α-actinin 2, telethonin, and γ-filamin/ABP-L. Therefore, we have named this novel γ-filamin/ABP-L, α-actinin-2 andtelethonin binding protein of the Z-disc of skeletal muscle, FATZ. On the basis of the information known about its binding partners, we could envisage a central role for FATZ in the myofibrillogenesis. Primary human myoblasts (CHQ5B) were obtained from Dr. Vincent Mouly (URA, Paris, France). The cells were isolated and grown as described previously (13Faulkner G. Pallavicini A.,. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Differentiation medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.4% Ultroser G (Life Technologies, Inc.). The mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 (14Blau H.M. Chiu C.P. Webster C. Cell. 1983; 32: 1171-1180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. S. Soddu (CRS, Rome, Italy). Two full-length skeletal muscle cDNA libraries were screened to complete the human FATZ transcript. The first was prepared from human adult pectoral muscle mRNA and cloned into pcDNAII plasmid vector (Invitrogen), and the second, from a commercial source (CLONTECH), was cloned into the pGAD10 yeast expression vector. Both these libraries were arrayed in 96-well plates containing 50 recombinant clones per well. Two rounds of PCR1 screening were performed on bacterial lysates from the plate wells to isolate the longest FATZ cDNA clones (13Faulkner G. Pallavicini A.,. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Six full-length cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced from the two libraries. A similar approach was used to isolate the mouse FATZ transcript. Five independent full-length clones were isolated from a mouse diaphragm muscle cDNA library cloned in the Uni-Zap XR λ vector (Stratagene). The sequences were produced from full-length cDNA clones using a primer-walking strategy and analyzed on a PE Applied Biosystems 377 automated DNA sequencer with fluorescent BigDye™ terminators. Sequences were assembled using the SeqMan II computer program (DNAStar, Madison WI). Proteins from lysates (60 μg) of muscle cells and tissues were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with milk buffer (PBS, 10% milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, washed, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either the GST protein (6 μg) alone or with the GST-FATZ protein (6 μg) in milk buffer. Then the membrane was washed, incubated with goat anti-GST antibody (1/1000) for 2 h at room temperature, washed again, and incubated with rabbit anti-goat conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (AP). Purified recombinant proteins (1 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Immobilon P membrane that was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with cell lysates (60 μg per blot). The lysate was prepared by sonication of the cells in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% Tween 20 and then diluted 200-fold in 5% milk buffer plus 0.05% Tween 20. The membrane was washed and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either preimmune sera or monoclonal anti-sarcomeric α-actinin antibody (Sigma A7811) at 1/500 dilution. Goat anti-mouse conjugated with AP (1/20,000) was used as the second antibody. Differentiated C2C12 cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus methionine for 3 h and then labeled with [35S]methionine overnight. The cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and sonicated briefly on ice. Equal amounts (2 μg) of the GST protein alone or the GST-FATZ protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B were mixed with [35S]methionine-labeled cell lysate (150 μg) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were washed and run on 15% SDS-acrylamide gels. The dried gels were exposed to SR Packard phosphorscreens, and the analysis was done on a Packard Cyclone PhosphorImager (Packard Instrument Co.). Both Bio-Rad pre-stained precision (Bio-Rad) and rainbow 14C-methylated protein (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) molecular weight markers were used in these experiments. Sections of heart and skeletal muscle fibers were prepared using an ultramicrotome (Reichart Ultracut S, Leica). The samples were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%), dehydrated, embedded in Lowicryl resin K4M (Sigma), and then ultrathin sections (0.1 μm) cut. The muscle sections were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin plus 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with mouse polyclonal antibody to the recombinant FATZ protein used at a 1/25 dilution for heart and a 1/50 dilution for skeletal muscle samples. Anti-mouse IgG whole molecule conjugated with 5-nm gold particles (Sigma G-7527) was used as the secondary antibody, at a 1/20 dilution. After counter-staining the sections were visualized using a transmission EM (Zeiss 255/230, Carl Zeiss, Germany). Tissue sections as well as primary human and mouse muscle cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%), permeabilized with Tween 20 (0.05%), and then blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20. The samples were incubated with mouse anti-FATZ or rabbit anti-actin (Sigma A2668) antibodies used at 1/30 and 1/50 dilutions, respectively. The secondary antibodies used for these experiments were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Sigma F 4018) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Calbiochem). An Axiovert 35 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) at × 40 magnification was used to view and photograph the slides. Northern blot analysis was done using mRNA filters obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Human and mouse tissue filters contained 1 μg of mRNA per lane from different tissues as indicated in Fig. 2. Specific probes corresponding to the 3′-portion of the FATZ transcript were generated by PCR amplification of the cDNA clone with specific primers in the presence of 50 μCi of [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay was performed on a panel of 16 different human tissue cDNAs (human MTC panels I and II,CLONTECH) using primers specific for the 3′-portion of the FATZ mRNA. The cDNA for FATZ was cloned into both the pQE9 His tag (Qiagen) and pGEX 6P (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prokaryote expression vectors and then sequenced to confirm that there were no significant changes from the original transcript. FATZ was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) for the His tag protein and glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the GST-tagged protein. The His-tagged FATZ protein was used to immunize rabbits and mice for the production of polyclonal antibodies. Mouse and human heart and skeletal muscle extracts were prepared as described (13Faulkner G. Pallavicini A.,. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Human tissue extracts were obtained fromCLONTECH (catalog number 7800-7808 and 7813), and all except skeletal muscle (10 μg) were used at 60 μg of total protein concentration. The extracts were run on 12 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10–60 μg of total protein per lane). Polyclonal antibody to the FATZ protein was used at a 1/200–1/400 dilution. The myosin monoclonal antibody MF 20 developed by Dr. D. A. Fischman was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma bank maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA. Goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma A3562) was used as the second antibody. As detailed previously (13Faulkner G. Pallavicini A.,. Formentin E. Comelli A.

This procedure was used to estimate the amount of human α-actin (data not shown) and FATZ protein (Fig. 4) present in total skeletal muscle extract. The FATZ coding sequence was PCR-amplified from human skeletal muscle cDNA with primers containing EcoRI and SalI sites. The cDNA fragment was subcloned into pHybLex/Zeo (Invitrogen), and the resulting clone was sequenced to confirm it was in frame with LexA. Then the construct was transformed in the L40 yeast strain (16Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) using the lithium acetate protocol (17Agatep, R., Kirkpatrick, R. D., Parchaliuk, D. L., Woods, R. A., and Gietz., R. D. (1998) Technical Tips Online 01525.Google Scholar) and plated on YPAD plus zeocin (300 μg/ml). The LexA fusion bait does not activate the His reporter when grown on selective medium without histidine. Western blotting using both the FATZ and LexA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies confirmed that the expected fusion protein was translated. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from human skeletal muscle mRNA (Invitrogen) using the Gubler and Hoffman procedure. After removing the molecules shorter than 400 bp by CLB4 spun column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the cDNA was ligated to the B42 activation domain in pYES/Trp2 cut with BstXI andNotI (Invitrogen). The library consists of 7.3 × 106 primary transformants. The plasmid DNA from 2.5 × 106 colonies was purified after amplification on solid medium and then used for the yeast two-hybrid screen. L40 yeast strain containing the FATZ bait was transformed with library plasmid DNA (45 μg), obtaining 3.75 × 106 yeast transformants. After 5 days, 160 of the largest growing colonies were pooled and the plasmids extracted and electroporated into the DH10B Escherichia coli strain. In order to screen for nonspecific interactions, these library plasmids were used to transform the L40 yeast strain containing the control vector pHybLex/Zeo-Laminin. Clones that did not activate the β-galactosidase reporter were pooled (575 of the 645 colonies tested) and, after a new DNA preparation, the library plasmids were finally retransformed into L40 yeast strain containing the FATZ bait. Double transformants (150) were tested for activation of the β-galactosidase reporter and then the cDNA inserts from 74 blue colonies were analyzed by sequencing. NH2-teminal deletions of ACTN2 cloned in pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH) were recovered from a previous two-hybrid hunt (13Faulkner G. Pallavicini A.,. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal deletions were obtained by PCR amplification of human skeletal muscle cDNA using reverse primers designed to cover the functional domains of ACTN2 (ABD, SLR1, SLR2, SLR3, and SLR4). The forward and reverse primers were designed to contain EcoRI and XhoI sites for ligation into the pYESTrp2 vector. The structure of the truncation mutants obtained is described in Fig. 9. Moreover, two deletion clones of FATZ were constructed, the NH2-terminal deletion has residues 75–299 and the COOH-terminal preserves the region between residues 1 and 171. These regions were cloned using the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites of pHybLex/Zeo. The FATZ transcript was discovered as part of a systematic sequencing project for human skeletal muscle ESTs at Centro di Ricerca Interdipartimentale per le Biotecnologie Innovative, Padova, Italy (18Lanfranchi G.

Transcript HSPD00355, hereafter named FATZ, was found at a frequency of 0.2% and appeared to be expressed only in heart and skeletal muscle based on the result of a preliminary RT-PCR experiment. Human and mouse transcripts of FATZ were obtained by screening full-length muscle cDNA libraries. The human and mouse FATZ nucleotide sequences are shown in Fig. 1 and correspond to 1533 and 1329 bp, respectively. The open reading frame (ORF) of human FATZ is 897 bases encoding a putative protein of 299 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 31,743 Da, whereas the ORF of mouse FATZ encodes a protein of 296 amino acids with a molecular mass of 31,456 Da. The human and mouse coding sequences have a high degree of similarity; there are 9 bases less in the ORF of mouse FATZ and 85 base substitutions between mouse and human resulting in 27 changes in amino acid residues as can be seen in Fig. 1. The identity of human and mouse FATZ is 89.5% at the nucleotide level and 90% at the amino acid level. An extensive search for known functional domains was done on the FATZ sequence using a variety of computer programs. No functional domains could be detected using SMART (19Shultz J. Milpetz F.

Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) did not detect any transmembrane or actinin-type actin-binding domain in the FATZ protein; however, a nuclear localization signal was detected, and the FATZ protein was predicted to have a 65% probability of being nuclear. The genomic mapping was done using the radiation hybrid technique (23Walter M.A. Spillet D.J. Thomas P. Weissenbach J. Goodfellow P.N. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), placing the FATZ gene on human chromosome 10q22.1 at 8.56 cR distance from WI-2997. Northern blot analysis of different tissues using the 3′-untranslated region of FATZ as a probe revealed that skeletal muscle is the main site of expression of this gene. A major band was detected at 1.5 kb in human (Fig. 2, A and B) and 1.35 kb in mouse (Fig. 2 C) skeletal muscle. However, on longer exposure, 24 h (right panels, Fig. 2,A and B) as opposed to 2 h (left panels, Fig. 2, A and B), a positive signal can be detected in heart, prostate, and although very weak, also in pancreas. Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues (Fig. 2 C) confirms the muscle-restricted expression pattern of FATZ. The results of the RT-PCR shown in Fig. 2 D also confirm that skeletal muscle is the major site of expression of the FATZ protein; however, some expression can be detected in heart, prostate, and testis after 29 cycles of PCR. Western blot assays using various human and mouse tissues were performed to detect the tissue specificity of the recombinant proteins and to allow an estimation of the molecular weight of the proteins based on electrophoretic mobility. From the results using human tissues (Fig. 3), it can be seen that FATZ is present to a lesser extent in heart and testis than in skeletal muscle tissue even when using higher amounts of total protein (60 μg) compared with that of skeletal muscle (10 μg). FATZ has the same pattern of distribution in mouse tissues as in human, which is predominantly found in skeletal muscle and to a lesser extent in heart (data not shown). It may be noted (Fig. 3) that there are two extra bands detected in heart and skeletal muscle (28 and 16 kDa) other than that of the FATZ protein (34 kDa). The molecular weight of FATZ is higher than that estimated from its sequence; this could possibly be due to phosphorylation as FATZ has 11 potential phosphorylation sites predicted by ProSite (24Hofmann K. Bucher P. Falquet L. Bairoch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). The extra bands that were detected by the anti-FATZ antibody in heart and skeletal muscle extracts appear to be due to degradation of FATZ. Only the main FATZ protein band (34 kDa) could be detected when muscle tissue or cell extracts were prepared in buffers containing protease inhibitors. Therefore, the FATZ protein seems to be susceptible to protease degradation. In order to estimate the level of FATZ protein present in muscle tissue, we employed a method (15Valle G. Faulkner G. De Antoni A. Pacchioni B. Pallavicini A. Pandolfo D. Tiso N. Toppo S. Trevisan S. Lanfranchi G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 13Faulkner G. Pallavicini A.,. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) based on the intensity of the signal obtained from Western blot analysis to determine the relative amount of a specific protein in tissue extracts. This method only gives an estimate of the amount of protein present in muscle tissue based on two main assumptions as follows: 1) that proteins of the same size, blotted under the same conditions, have the same rate of blotting; 2) that the antibody used has the same affinity for the native and recombinant proteins. However, within these limits it gives a reasonable approximation of the percentage of an unknown recombinant protein present in muscle tissue. This procedure was used to estimate the amount of human FATZ protein (Fig. 4) present in 5 and 10 μg of total skeletal muscle protein; α-actin was used as a control (13Faulkner G. Pallavicini A.,. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). By densitometric analysis the signal detected from 100 ng of recombinant FATZ protein was equivalent to 10 μg of total skeletal muscle proteins (Fig. 4), whereas 500 ng of recombinant α-actin was approximately equivalent to 2.5 μg of total skeletal muscle proteins (data not shown). Therefore, the FATZ protein would appear to be 1% of total muscle protein, and the percentage of α-actin was in agreement with the percentage (19%) previously found for α-actin in rabbit muscle (25Pollard T. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The percentage of 1% for FATZ protein in skeletal muscle is relatively high, 6 times more than expected, since the FATZ mRNA was found with a frequency of 0.2%, although the percentage of protein refers to the mass, whereas the percentage of transcript refers to the number of molecules. The expression pattern of the FATZ protein during differentiation was studied both by Western blotting (Fig. 5 A) and immunofluorescence (Fig. 5 B). Cell lysates were prepared from both human and mouse muscle cells at different times after the addition of differentiation medium. As can be seen in Fig. 5, very little FATZ protein could be detected in both human and mouse undifferentiated cell lysates, whereas the FATZ protein (34 kDa) was clearly visible in differentiated cells and increased with time of differentiation. In addition to the 34-kDa band of FATZ protein a lower band (28 kDa) and some faint higher (52 and 56 kDa) bands could be detected. It is possible that some proteins in muscle cells have epitopes similar to that of the FATZ protein; however, the lower band would appear to be due to degradation. Immunofluorescence experiments were undertaken to obtain an indication of the cellular localization of FATZ in muscle cells (Fig. 5 B) at various stages of differentiation as well as in skeletal (Fig. 6 A) and heart muscle tissue sections (data not shown). Antibodies to muscle α-actin and myosin were used as controls. Although the FATZ protein can be detected in undifferentiated muscle cells (Fig. 5 A), it was mainly present in differentiated cells (Fig. 5 B). In undifferentiated cells incubated with antibodies to FATZ a fluorescent signal can be seen localized near the nucleus and pseudopodia, whereas in the multinucleated differentiated cells a strong fluorescent signal can be detected in a more extensive area of the myotubes (Fig. 5 B). Only a very weak fluorescent signal can be detected in undifferentiated and differentiated cells incubated with preimmune serum (Fig. 5 B) and in undifferentiated cells incubated with myosin (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, in differentiated cells incubated with myosin (Fig. 5 B), a very strong fluorescent signal can be detected throughout the myotubes. Sections of human heart and muscle when stained with the anti-FATZ antibody show a characteristic cross-striated pattern, which is typically seen with sarcomeric proteins (Fig. 6 A). In double fluorescence experiments an alternate banding pattern could be detected using antibodies to FATZ (red) and ZASP (green), and these signals seem to be coincident (Fig. 6 A). As ZASP is known to be located in the Z-disc of skeletal muscle (13Faulkner G. Pallavicini A.,. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V.

https://openalex.org/W2136560728,"Brevican is a member of the lectican family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system. The susceptibility of brevican to digestion by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10, and -13 and membrane type 1 and 3 MMPs) and aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS4) was examined. MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13 degraded brevican into a few fragments with similar molecular masses, whereas the degradation products of aggrecanase-1 had apparently different sizes. NH2-terminal sequence analyses of the digestion fragments revealed that cleavages of the brevican core protein by these metalloproteinases occurred commonly within the central non-homologous domain. MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13 preferentially attacked the Ala360–Phe361 bond, whereas aggrecanase-1 cleaved the Glu395–Ser396 bond, which are similar to the cleavage sites observed with cartilage proteoglycan (aggrecan) for the MMPs and aggrecanase-1, respectively. These data demonstrate that MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13 and aggrecanase-1 digest brevican in a similar pattern to aggrecan and suggest that they may be responsible for the physiological turnover and pathological degradation of brevican.

The lecticans are a family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that include aggrecan (cartilage proteoglycan), versican, neurocan, and brevican (1Yamaguchi Y. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Like other proteoglycans, lecticans are complex macromolecules that consist of a core protein and one or more types of glycosaminoglycan chains attached to the core protein (3Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). The core proteins of lecticans consist of two globular domains at the NH2 and COOH termini and a central region connecting the two globular domains. The NH2-terminal globular domain represents a hyaluronic acid-binding domain comprising an immunoglobulin-like loop and two proteoglycan tandem repeats. The COOH-terminal globular domain forms a selectin-like C-type lectin domain complex consisting of epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a C-type lectin-like domain, and a complement regulatory protein-like domain (4Gary S.C. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Unlike these globular domains, the central region is not conserved among the lectican family members. Brevican is the most abundant lectican in the adult brain and is also subject to proteolytic processing (1Yamaguchi Y. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 5Yamada H. Fredette B. Shitara K. Hagihara K. Miura R. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the adult brain, brevican exists as full-length and proteolytically cleaved forms (5Yamada H. Fredette B. Shitara K. Hagihara K. Miura R. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol.

The major cleavage site is at the Glu395–Ser396bond within the central domain of the core protein (6Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamasaki M. Yamaguchi Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 216: 957-963Google Scholar). This cleavage site bears sequence similarities to the aggrecanase cleavage site on the aggrecan core protein (7Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamasaki M. Yamaguchi Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 216: 957-963Google Scholar). It has been shown that brevican expression is up-regulated in invasive glioma cell lines (8Jaworski D.M. Kelly G.M. Piepmeier J.M. Hockfield S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2293-2298PubMed Google Scholar) and that forced expression of brevican renders noninvasive glioma cells invasive (9Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this invasion-stimulating activity requires truncation of brevican near the reported proteolytic cleavage site: expression of the NH2-terminal fragment of brevican renders noninvasive glioma cells invasive in vivo, whereas expression of full-length brevican does not have this effect (9Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that proteinases attacking brevican play an important role in glioma invasion. However, no information is available on the proteinases involved in this process. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 are a gene family of structurally and functionally related zinc endopeptidases, which consists of at least 20 different members in humans (10Okada Y. Kelley W.N. Harris Jr., E.D. Ruddy S. Sledge D.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000Google Scholar). MMPs are involved in the physiological remodeling and pathological degradation of extracellular matrices, including proteoglycans (10Okada Y. Kelley W.N. Harris Jr., E.D. Ruddy S. Sledge D.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000Google Scholar). For the degradation of aggrecan, most MMPs digest the core protein at the Asn341–Phe342 bond (11Fosang A.J. Neame P.J. Last K. Hardingham T.E. Murphy G. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19470-19474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Tortorella et al. (12Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P. Wynn R. Rockwell A. Yang F. Duke J.L. Solomon K. George H. Bruckner R. Nagase H. Itoh Y. Ellis D.M. Ross H. Wiswall B.H. Murphy K. Hillman Jr., M.C. Hollis G.F. Newton R.C. Magolda R.L. Trzaskos J.M. Arner E.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) recently cloned aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS4 (adisintegrin andmetalloproteinase withthrombospondin motifs)), which preferably cleaves the aggrecan core protein at the Glu373–Ala374 bond. Since aggrecan fragments with NH2 termini of A374RGSVILTAKPDF and F342FGVG are detected in synovial fluids from arthritic patients (13Sandy J.D. Flannery C.R. Neame P.J. Lohmander L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 14Lohmander L.S. Neame P.J. Sandy J.D.

Invest. 1996; 98: 2292-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), both MMPs and aggrecanase-1 are thought to be responsible for the aggrecan degradation in human arthritides (10Okada Y. Kelley W.N. Harris Jr., E.D. Ruddy S. Sledge D.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000Google Scholar). Interestingly, the sequence of aggrecanase-1 was originally deposited in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank (accession number KIAA0688) as an unidentified human gene from a set of size-fractionated human brain cDNA libraries (12Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P. Wynn R. Rockwell A. Yang F. Duke J.L. Solomon K. George H. Bruckner R. Nagase H. Itoh Y. Ellis D.M. Ross H. Wiswall B.H. Murphy K. Hillman Jr., M.C. Hollis G.F. Newton R.C. Magolda R.L. Trzaskos J.M. Arner E.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that aggrecanase-1 is expressed in normal and pathological brains. Moreover, MMPs are expressed in the human astrocytic tumors, and some are also in normal brain tissues (16Nakano A. Tani E. Miyazaki K. Yamamoto Y. Furuyama J. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 83: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 17Nakada M. Nakamura H. Ikeda E. Fujimoto N. Yamashita J. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, these metalloproteinases are likely to be involved in brevican degradation in gliomas. In this study, we examined the susceptibility of brevican to 10 different MMPs, including MMP-1 (tissue collagenase), MMP-2 (gelatinase A), MMP-3 (stromelysin-1), MMP-7 (matrilysin), MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase), MMP-9 (gelatinase B), MMP-10 (stromelysin-2), MMP-13 (collagenase-3), membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP), and membrane type 3 MMP (MT3-MMP), and aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS4). The data demonstrate that MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13 and aggrecanase-1 digest brevican into fragments with lower molecular masses by cleaving the Ala360–Phe361 (MMP site) and Glu395–Ser396 (aggrecanase site) bonds of the central non-homologous domain. For preparation of recombinant brevican, Chinese hamster ovary cells were stably transfected with the expression vector pcDNA-rBV, which contains a full-length rat brevican cDNA. Recombinant brevican was purified from culture supernatants by affinity column chromatography on the fibronectin type III 3–5 repeats of tenascin-R as described previously (18Miura R. Aspberg A.

Aggrecanase-1 cDNA in the pBluescript II SK+ vector (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number KIAA0688) was provided by Dr. Takahiro Nagase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Japan). The aggrecanase-1 cDNA fragments encoding Met1–Lys837 were polymerase chain reaction-amplified using 5′-primers with an extraEcoRI site and a 3′-primer with an extra BglII site. These fragments were inserted between the EcoRI andBglII sites of the mammalian expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene), giving rise to pSG0688. To add the FLAG epitope tag (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) to the COOH terminus of the aggrecanase-1 protein, the polymerase chain reaction products corresponding to both the FLAG epitope tag and stop codon were inserted into the BglII site of the pSG0688 vector, generating the pSG0688F vector. Nucleotide sequences of mutants were confirmed by direct sequencing. DNA sequencing analysis was performed by the polymerase chain reaction using fluorescent dideoxynucleotides and a MegaBase Model 1000 automated sequencer (Molecular Dynamics Japan, Tokyo). COS-7 cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cotransfected with the aggrecanase-1 expression vector (5.5 μg/15-cm dish) and the furin expression vector (2.0 μg/dish) inN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N,-trimethylammonium salts (45 μg/dish; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The culture media were harvested 3 days after transfection and used for purification. They were concentrated by an Amicon Diaflo apparatus fitted with a YM-10 membrane and applied to an anti-FLAG M2 affinity chromatography column (Eastman Kodak Co.) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35, and 0.02% NaN3 (TNCB buffer). Recombinant aggrecanase-1 was eluted with 6 m urea in TNCB buffer containing 3 mNaCl after washing the column with the buffer containing 3m NaCl. The combined fractions of aggrecanase-1 were dialyzed against TNCB buffer to remove urea. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The activity was demonstrated by detection of the specific cleavage of bovine aggrecan upon immunoblotting after digestion with the purified enzyme as shown previously (12Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C.

The zymogens of MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10, and -13 were purified and activated by incubation with p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (Aldrich) according to previous methods (20Okada Y. Morodomi T.

Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2446-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 28Shimada T. Nakamura H. Ohuchi E. Fujii Y. Murakami Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As MMP-13 was not stable after purification, 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added to the enzyme solution as a carrier protein. Concentrations of MMP-1, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13 were determined in assays using fluorogenic synthetic substrates by titration of their activities against recombinant TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor ofmetalloproteinases; concentration determined by amino acid analysis), and those of MMP-2, MMP-9, MT1-MMP, and MT3-MMP by titration against recombinant TIMP-2 (concentration determined by amino acid analysis) (27Ohuchi E. Imai K. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2446-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 28Shimada T. Nakamura H. Ohuchi E. Fujii Y. Murakami Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Residual enzymatic activities were measured and plotted versus the TIMP concentrations. A linear plot of activity against the inhibitor molarity was extrapolated to be zero activity at the molarity of the enzyme solution. Digestion of brevican was initially examined by incubation of the substrate (600 ng) at 37° C for 24 h with each MMP (20 ng) or aggrecanase-1 (20 ng) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:30 in TNCB buffer. Since brevican was efficiently digested with MMP-2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13, time course digestion was performed by incubation with these MMPs for various amounts of time ranging from 0 to 24 h at the same enzyme/substrate ratio. The additive effects of aggrecanase-1 and MMP-2 on brevican digestion were examined by incubation of the substrate (600 ng) with aggrecanase-1 (20 ng) for 24 h and then with the addition of MMP-2 (20 ng) for another 24 h at 37° C or with both aggrecanase-1 (20 ng) and MMP-2 (20 ng) for 24 h at 37° C. These reactions were terminated with 20 mm EDTA, and the degradation products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under reducing conditions. Brevican (10 μg) was incubated with MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, or -13 or aggrecanase-1 at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:30 at 37° C for 24 h and with MMP-7 and MMP-13 for 1 h in a total reaction volume of 100 μl in TNCB buffer. Brevican (10 μg) was also incubated with aggrecanase-1 (0.34 μg) for 24 h and then with MMP-2 (0.34 μg) for another 24 h at 37° C in a total volume of 100 μl in TNCB buffer. These samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions after treatment with 20 mm EDTA. Proteins in the gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and located by staining with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The bands of interest were excised and sequenced by Edman degradation using a Procise 491 protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Tokyo). To analyze small fragments, the filtrate of a brevican sample digested with MMP-7 for 24 h was prepared by centrifugation using Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter units with cutoffs of 10 kDa, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Trifluoroacetic acid (5 μl) was added to the filtrate (200 μl) to make an acidic condition, and the sample was analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a TSKgel Super-ODS column (4.6 × 50 mm; Tosoh Co., Tokyo). Chromatography was carried out in the presence of 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid with a linear gradient of acetonitrile to 40% (20 min) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and at 50° C. By monitoring the absorbance at 210 nm, the unique fragment was recovered in the nearby range of 20% acetonitrile (data not shown). The amino acid sequence of the small separated fragment on a glass filter was analyzed by automated Edman degradation as described above. Purified aggrecanase-1 was homogeneous on SDS-PAGE, showing a single band of 69 kDa (data not shown). The activity of the purified enzyme was examined by an assay using bovine aggrecan. The enzyme generated a 60-kDa fragment, which was recognized by the polyclonal antibodies (I19C) specific to the COOH-terminal neoepitope (NITEGE373) of aggrecan generated by the activity of aggrecanase-1 (19Sugimoto K. Takahashi M. Yamamoto Y. Shimada K. Tanzawa K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), verifying that the recombinant enzyme has the same specificity as aggrecanase-1 (data not shown). Brevican was first digested for 24 h with 10 different MMPs (MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10, and -13, MT1-MMP, and MT3-MMP) and aggrecanase-1, and digestion fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13 degraded brevican into several fragments (Fig. 1). The activity of MMP-1 was weaker than that of the other MMPs. No or negligible digestion was observed with MMP-9, MT1-MMP, and MT3-MMP under the same conditions (Fig. 1). MMP-1, -2, and -8 generated similar sets of fragments of 86, 77, 57, and 51 kDa, but MMP-2 produced additional fragments of ∼35 and ∼30 kDa (Fig. 1). The digestion patterns of brevican with MMP-3 and MMP-10 were almost identical, generating fragments of 86, 77, 65, 60, and 51 kDa. MMP-13 digested brevican into fragments of 86, 77, 51, ∼35, and ∼32 kDa and fragments much smaller than 30 kDa. On the other hand, MMP-7 digested brevican into four major fragments of 63, 60, 56, and 51 kDa. In contrast to these MMPs, the degradation pattern of aggrecanase-1 was very different: only two major fragments of 83 and 56 kDa were obtained (Fig. 1). NH2-terminal sequence analyses of the brevican fragments generated by MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13 and aggrecanase-1 were performed. As shown in TableI, the 86-kDa species generated by MMP-1, -2, -3, -8, -10, and -13 had the same NH2-terminal sequence of F361SEASSP. The same NH2-terminal sequence was also obtained in the 77-kDa fragments by digestion with these MMPs. However, the 51-kDa fragments, which were commonly observed by treatment with MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13, had the NH2-terminal sequence D23DLKEDS,i.e. the NH2 terminus of the full-length molecule. The 57-kDa fragments produced by MMP-1, -2, and -8 digestion and those of 60 kDa produced by MMP-3 and MMP-10 also had the sequence D23DLKEDS. The 65-kDa fragments generated by MMP-3 and MMP-10 had the sequence A499VLQLGA. The ∼35-kDa fragment generated by MMP-2 digestion had the NH2 terminus E589KSGRTV. The ∼35- and ∼32-kDa fragments produced by MMP-13 digestion had the NH2 termini T580REVETP and D23DLKEDS, respectively. Since MMP-7 digested brevican initially into 84- and 56-kDa fragments and then into fragments of 63, 60, 56, and 51 kDa (Fig. 2 C), the NH2-terminal sequences of these fragments were determined. Unlike other MMPs, the 84-kDa fragment produced by MMP-7 digestion had the NH2 terminus L385QLPQEA, the 63- and 60-kDa fragments had L503GASPSP, and the 56- and 51-kDa fragments had D23DLKEDS. Since the common species with the NH2 terminus F361SEASSP were not found in these MMP-7 digestion fragments, we carried out NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the protein of <10 kDa in the filtrate of Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter units and found that the digestion product had the NH2 terminus F361SEASSP (Table I).Table INH2-terminal sequences of the brevican fragments generated by digestion with MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13 aggrecanase-1EnzymeFragment sizeNH2-terminal sequencekDaMMP-186F361 XEASXP77D23DXXEDS(F361SEASXX)57D23DLKEDX51D23DLKEDXMMP-286F361SEASSP77F361SEASSPD23DLKEDS (I400YSIPIT)57D23DLKEDS51D23DLKEDS∼35E589KSGRTV(S600VQAQPV)MMP-386F361SEASSP77F361SEASSPD23DLKEDS65A499VLQLGA(T521LQPPRE) (D23DLKEDS)60D23DLKEDS(A499VLQLGA) (T521LQPPRE)51D23DLKEDS(A499VLQLGA) (T521LQPPRE)MMP-784L385QLPQEA63L503GASPSP60L503GASPSP56D23DLKEDS(L503GASPSP)51D23DLKEDS(L503GASPSP)<10F361SEASSPMMP-886F361SEASSP77F361SEASSPD23DLKEDS57D23DLKEDS51D23DLKEDSMMP-1086F361SEASSP77F361SEASSPD23DLKEDS65A499VLQLGA(D23DLKEDS)60D23DLKEDS(A499VLQLGA)51D23DLKEDS(A499VLQLGA)MMP-1386F361SEASSP77F361SEASSP51D23DLKEDS∼35T580REVETP∼32D23DLKEDS(F361SEASSP)Aggrecanase-183S396RGAIYS56D23DLKEDSThe NH2-terminal sequences in parentheses are those of minor components.

In contrast, two major fragments of 83 and 56 kDa generated by aggrecanase-1 treatment had the NH2 termini S396RGAIYS and D23DLKEDS, respectively (TableI). Since the sum of their molecular masses (83 and 56 kDa) corresponds to the molecular mass of intact brevican (140 kDa), aggrecanase-1 appears to hydrolyze at the single site of the Glu395–Ser396 bond (Fig. 3). The 83-kDa fragment with the NH2 terminus S396RGAIYS, which corresponds exactly to the NH2 terminus of the fragment present in adult brains (6Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamasaki M. Yamaguchi Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 216: 957-963Google Scholar), was specific for aggrecanase-1 digestion: no MMPs tested in this study cleaved brevican at this site. Since brevican was significantly digested by MMP-2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13, time course digestion of brevican with these MMPs was carried out. As shown in Fig. 2 (B and E), digestion of brevican with MMP-3 and MMP-10 resulted in the appearance of the 86- and 77-kDa fragments of F360SEASSP and the 51-kDa fragments of D23DLKEDS within 1 h, and the density of the latter two bands appeared to increase in a time-dependent manner. This suggests that brevican is initially digested at the Ala360–Phe361 bond into the 51-kDa NH2-terminal fragment and the 86-kDa COOH-terminal fragment (Fig. 3), the latter of which appears to be almost simultaneously processed to the 77-kDa fragment through the COOH-terminal cleavage. Similar changes in the time course digestion were observed with MMP-13 (Fig. 2 F), but the 86-kDa fragment of F361SEASSP was further degraded into smaller fragments, indicating that this COOH-terminal fragment is susceptible to subsequent multiple cleavages. Upon digestion with MMP-2 and MMP-8 (Fig. 2, A and D), the 57- and 51-kDa NH2-terminal fragments of D23DLKEDS emerged simultaneously with the 86- and 77-kDa fragments of F361SEASSP, suggesting that in addition to the clip at the Ala360–Phe361 bond, at least another cleavage site downstream of the bond, which was not identified in this study, is present with these MMPs. In contrast, MMP-7 digested brevican into the 84-kDa fragment of L385QLPQE and into the 56-kDa fragment of D23DLKEDS within 30 min after incubation (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the initial cleavage is at the Glu384–Leu385 bond (Fig. 3). After longer incubations, the 63- and 60-kDa fragments of L503GASPSP and the 51-kDa fragment of D23DLKEDS emerged. Since a decrease in the density of the 84-kDa fragment of L385QLPQEA was associated with the appearance of the 63- and 60-kDa fragments of L503GASPSP, it is likely that subsequent cleavages of the 84-kDa fragment at least at the Gln502–Leu503bond occurred (Fig. 3). The 51-kDa fragment of D23DLKEDS appeared to result from the COOH-terminal cleavage of the 56-kDa fragment of D23DLKEDS because it was produced after the appearance of the 56-kDa fragment. Among MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13, capable of digesting brevican, only MMP-2 is so far known to be expressed and also activated in human gliomas (17Nakada M. Nakamura H. Ikeda E. Fujimoto N. Yamashita J. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 29Merzak A. Pilkington G.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1997; 16: 155-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, our preliminary study showed that aggrecanase-1 is expressed in gliomas as well as in normal human brain tissues. 2D. Kita, M. Nakada, H. Nakamura, and Y. Okada, unpublished data. Thus, to assess the additive effects of aggrecanase-1 and MMP-2, we carried out the sequential digestion of brevican by incubation first with aggrecanase-1 for 24 h and then with MMP-2 for an additional 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4, the 83- and 56-kDa fragments generated by the action of aggrecanase-1 were further hydrolyzed into major 56- and 51-kDa fragments with MMP-2. The identical digestion pattern was obtained when brevican was incubated simultaneously with aggrecanase-1 and MMP-2 for 24 h (Fig. 4). NH2-terminal sequence analysis demonstrated that the 56- and 51-kDa final products of these proteinases have the same NH2 terminus D23DLKEDS. These data indicate that the 56-kDa NH2-terminal fragment generated by aggrecanase-1 is processed to the 51-kDa fragment through the COOH-terminal cleavage by MMP-2, whereas the 83-kDa COOH-terminal fragment is digested by MMP-2 into multiple small fragments. This study is the first to demonstrate the digestion of brevican by MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -10, and -13, MT1-MMP, MT3-MMP, and aggrecanase-1. Of the MMPs and aggrecanase-1 examined, brevican was degraded by MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13 and aggrecanase-1. MMP-1, -2, -8, and -13 contribute primarily to the degradation of fibrillar collagens such as collagen types I–III through the specific cleavage of the collagen molecules into the characteristic ¾- and ¼-length fragments by MMP-1, -8, and -13 and the subsequent degradation of the denatured fragments by MMP-2 (10Okada Y. Kelley W.N. Harris Jr., E.D. Ruddy S. Sledge D.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000Google Scholar, 30Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). However, this study demonstrates that these MMPs are also active on brevican, as demonstrated for aggrecan (10Okada Y. Kelley W.N. Harris Jr., E.D. Ruddy S. Sledge D.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000Google Scholar, 11Fosang A.J. Neame P.J. Last K. Hardingham T.E. Murphy G. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19470-19474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since MMP-3 and MMP-10 are structurally related and share activity for many substrates including aggrecan (10Okada Y. Kelley W.N. Harris Jr., E.D. Ruddy S. Sledge D.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000Google Scholar), one could expect their degradative activity for brevican. Actually, both MMP-3 and MMP-10 cleaved brevican into almost identical fragments. On the other hand, the proteolytic activity of MMP-7 for brevican was different from that of other MMPs. MMP-7 quickly digested brevican into smaller fragments. Although kinetic analysis was not carried out in this study, MMP-7 appears to have the highest activity among these MMPs capable of degrading brevican. This character of MMP-7 has been demonstrated with many substrates such as elastin (22Imai K. Yokohama Y. Nakanishi I. Ohuchi E. Fujii Y. Nakai N. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6691-6697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), aggrecan (11Fosang A.J. Neame P.J. Last K. Hardingham T.E. Murphy G. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19470-19474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), decorin (31Imai K. Hiramatsu A. Fukushima D. Pierschbacher M.D. Okada Y. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and tenascin (32Imai K. Kusakabe M. Sakakura T. Nakanishi I. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This can be explained by the structural characteristics of MMP-7 since MMP-7 may readily have access to substrates for lack of the COOH-terminal hemopexin-like domain. MMP-13 is also known to be strongly active on aggrecan (33Fosang A.J. Last K. Knauper V. Murphy G. Neame P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). As expected, this was the case with brevican digestion. MMP-9, MT1-MMP, and MT3-MMP have proteolytic activity for aggrecan (11Fosang A.J. Neame P.J. Last K. Hardingham T.E. Murphy G. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19470-19474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1999; 262: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Contrary to our expectation, however, all these MMPs had no or negligible activity for brevican. NH2-terminal sequence analyses of the brevican digestion fragments provided evidence that the central non-homologous domain of brevican is commonly attacked by these MMPs and aggrecanase-1. The 51-kDa fragment observed in all the samples digested with the MMPs showed the identical NH2-terminal sequence of D23DLKEDS, the same NH2-terminal sequence of intact brevican. This fragment appears to be a stable end product after digestion with the MMPs since there was no further progressive degradation by the MMPs. Because of the glycosylation of brevican, it was difficult to calculate the molecular masses of the fragments from the amino acid sequence data. However, the molecular mass of the NH2-terminal fragment encoding the hyaluronic acid-binding domain of rat brevican (Asp23–Gly371) is known to be ∼50 kDa when it is expressed in 9L gliosarcoma cells (9Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that the COOH terminus of the 51-kDa fragment may end around Gly371, although information about the COOH terminus is not available. One of the most interesting findings in the NH2-terminal sequence data on the MMP digestion products is the appearance of the fragments with the NH2 terminus F361SEASSP. The fragments emerged as bands of 86 and 77 kDa in the reaction products with MMP-1, -2, -3, -8, -10, and -13. In the analyses of the filtrate of the digestion products of MMP-7, a very low molecular mass (probably <10 kDa) fragment with the same NH2 terminus was also demonstrated. Thus, the Ala360–Phe361 bond of the central non-homologous domain is considered to be the common cleavage site susceptible to most MMPs (Fig. 3). Based on the data of the time course digestion of brevican and NH2-terminal sequences of the digestion fragments, MMP-3, -10, and -13 appear to cleave faster at the Ala360–Phe361 bond than at other sites, although cleavages of brevican at least at two sites, including the Ala360–Phe361 bond, may occur almost simultaneously with MMP-2 and MMP-8. On the other hand, the data on the time course digestion with MMP-7 indicate that cleavage at the Ala360–Phe361 bond is preceded by those at the Glu384–Leu385 and Gln502–Leu503 bonds. It is notable that aggrecanase-1 digested brevican into two fragments of 83 and 56 kDa, which were distinct from any proteolytic fragments generated by MMPs. Moreover, these fragments remained even after complete digestion of the intact molecule, suggesting that aggrecanase-1 activity is restricted to some specific sites of the substrate. NH2-terminal sequence analyses demonstrated that the 83-kDa species represents the COOH-terminal fragment S396RGAIYS, whereas the 56-kDa species is the NH2-terminal fragment D23DLKEDS. These data suggest that cleavage of brevican by aggrecanase-1 occurs only at the Glu395–Ser396 bond to form NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments of 56 and 83 kDa, respectively. During the revision of this paper, Matthews et al. (34Matthews R.T. Gary S.C. Zerillo C. Pratta M. Solomon K. Arner E.C. Hockfield S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22695-22703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) also reported that aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS4) processes brevican into two fragments of similar sizes (90 and 50 kDa) by cleavage at the Glu395–Ser396 bond, which was demonstrated by an antibody (B50) specific to the COOH-terminal neoepitope (QEAVESE395) of brevican. A previous study indicated that normal adult rat brains contain intact brevican of ∼145 kDa and an ∼80-kDa COOH-terminal fragment with the NH2 terminus S396RGAIYSIPITE (7Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamasaki M. Yamaguchi Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 216: 957-963Google Scholar). Although this study did not identify the NH2-terminal fragment (7Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamasaki M. Yamaguchi Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 216: 957-963Google Scholar), the transfection of rat brevican cDNA into 9L gliosarcoma cells demonstrated the NH2-terminal fragment of ∼50 kDa together with the COOH-terminal fragment (9Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that brevican is readily processed by proteinases at the Glu395–Ser396 bond into the ∼50-kDa NH2-terminal and ∼80-kDa COOH-terminal species in brain tissues and/or glioma cells (4Gary S.C. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamasaki M. Yamaguchi Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 216: 957-963Google Scholar). The present data, together with the expression of aggrecanase-1 in human brains (12Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Decicco C.P. Wynn R. Rockwell A. Yang F. Duke J.L. Solomon K. George H. Bruckner R. Nagase H. Itoh Y. Ellis D.M. Ross H. Wiswall B.H. Murphy K. Hillman Jr., M.C. Hollis G.F. Newton R.C. Magolda R.L. Trzaskos J.M. Arner E.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), suggest that aggrecanase-1 is a candidate for the brevican-processing enzymes in the brain. There is little overall sequence homology between brevican and aggrecan in the central domains. However, the amino acid sequences around the aggrecanase-1 cleavage site of brevican (Glu-Ser-Glu395↓Ser396-Arg-Gly) have significant similarities to those of aggrecan (Glu-Gly-Glu373↓Ala374-Arg-Gly) (Fig. 3). In addition, several conserved residues upstream of the cleavage sites (Thr377-Val-Thr-X-X-X-X-Glu-Leu-X-Leu-Pro) are present (Fig. 3). These sequence similarities may explain the susceptibility of brevican and aggrecan to digestion by aggrecanase-1. Many MMPs, including MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, and -13 and MT1-MMP, are known to preferentially cleave the Asn341–Phe342 bond of aggrecan, which is thus called the MMP site (35Fosang A.J. Last K. Gardiner P. Jackson D.C. Brown L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A similar MMP site for brevican,i.e. the Ala360–Phe361 bond, was also observed since MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -10, and -13 commonly cleaved the bond. Unlike the aggrecanase sites of brevican and aggrecan, there was no strong sequence homology in the region around the MMP sites of the two molecules. However, the sequences at the cleavage sites have two conserved residues:Pro-Ser-Ala360↓Phe361-Ser-Glu for brevican andPro-Glu-Asn341↓Phe342-Phe-Gly for aggrecan. Sequential digestion of brevican with aggrecanase-1 and MMP-2 produced a stable NH2-terminal fragment of 51 kDa through the processing of the 56-kDa aggrecanase-1 digestion fragment by MMP-2. The same result was obtained by the simultaneous digestion with these proteinases, indicating that brevican is initially attacked by aggrecanase-1 and subsequently by MMP-2 in their coexistence. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of the ∼50-kDa NH2-terminal fragment of brevican is associated with an invasive phenotype of glioma cells (9Zhang H. Kelly G. Zerillo C. Jaworski D.M. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2370-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although its molecular mechanism is unknown. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans exert an inhibitory influence on neurite outgrowth through their chondroitin sulfate moieties (36Snow D.M. Lemmon V. Carrino D.A. Caplan A.I. Silver J. Exp. Neurol. 1990; 109: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Actually, chondroitin sulfate chains of brevican are known to be essential to inhibit neurite outgrowth from cerebellar granule neurons (5Yamada H. Fredette B. Shitara K. Hagihara K. Miura R. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the four potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites of brevican are located in the central non-homologous domain (4Gary S.C. Kelly G.M. Hockfield S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the NH2-terminal fragments generated by aggrecanase-1 and/or MMP-2 are considered to lack glycosaminoglycan. Thus, it is possible to speculate that these metalloproteinases may promote glioma cell invasion through formation of the brevican fragments without glycosaminoglycan chains. On the other hand, recent studies suggested that brevican plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of the brain extracellular matrix by forming molecular bridges linking hyaluronan and tenascin-R through the NH2- and COOH-terminal globular domains of brevican, respectively (1Yamaguchi Y. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Thus, the disruption or weakening of the brevican-hyaluronan and/or brevican-tenascin-R interactions may be one of the factors that accelerate the invasiveness of glioma cells. Such disruption can be induced by cleavage of the brevican core proteins by aggrecanase-1 and/or MMP-2, both of which are present in human glioma tissues (17Nakada M. Nakamura H. Ikeda E. Fujimoto N. Yamashita J. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 29Merzak A. Pilkington G.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1997; 16: 155-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).2 These hypotheses remain to be elucidated by further studies of how the brevican fragments generated by the action of the MMPs and/or aggrecanase-1 affect glioma cell invasion.

https://openalex.org/W2023045668,"The initiation step of mucin-typeO-glycosylation is controlled by a large family of homologous UDP-GalNAc:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-transferases). Differences in kinetic properties, substrate specificities, and expression patterns of these isoenzymes provide for differential regulation of O-glycan attachment sites and density. Recently, it has emerged that some GalNAc-transferase isoforms in vitro selectively function with partially GalNAcO-glycosylated acceptor peptides rather than with the corresponding unglycosylated peptides. O-Glycan attachment to selected sites, most notably two sites in the MUC1 tandem repeat, is entirely dependent on the glycosylation-dependent function of GalNAc-T4. Here we present data that a putative lectin domain found in the C terminus of GalNAc-T4 functions as a GalNAc lectin and confers its glycopeptide specificity. A single amino acid substitution in the lectin domain of a secreted form of GalNAc-T4 selectively blocked GalNAc-glycopeptide activity, while the general activity to peptides exerted by this enzyme was unaffected. Furthermore, the GalNAc-glycopeptide activity of wild-type secreted GalNAc-T4 was selectively inhibited by free GalNAc, while the activity with peptides was unaffected."

Dronc is the only fly caspase known to be regulated by the hormone ecdysone. Here we show that ectopic expression of dronc in the developing fly eye leads to increased cell death and an ablated eye phenotype that can be suppressed by halving the dosage of the genes in the H99complex (reaper, hid, and grim) and enhanced by mutations in diap1. In contrast to previous reports, we show that the dronc eye ablation phenotype can be suppressed by coexpression of the baculoviral caspase inhibitorp35. Dronc also interacts, both genetically and biochemically, with the CED-4/Apaf-1 fly homolog, Dark. Furthermore, extracts made from Dark homozygous mutant flies have reduced ability to process Dronc, showing that Dark is required for Dronc processing. Finally, using the RNA interference technique, we show that loss of Dronc function in early Drosophila embryos results in a dramatic decrease in cell death, indicating that Dronc is important for programmed cell death during embryogenesis. These results suggest that Dronc is a key caspase mediating programmed cell death inDrosophila.

These proteases are synthesized as precursor molecules that are processed in cells undergoing apoptosis to generate two subunits that fold into a tetrameric active enzyme conformation. In mammals, 14 caspases have been described thus far, which can be grouped into two classes based upon the length of their prodomain (1Kumar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 198-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 2Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 3Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Caspases containing a long prodomain, such as caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10, appear to be activated first by a proximity-induced autoprocessing mechanism involving clustering of procaspase molecules, often assisted by specific adaptor molecules (4Kumar S. Colussi P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These caspases contain specific protein-protein interaction domains in the prodomain region that mediate their interaction with their respective adaptors or mediate dimerization of procaspase molecules (4Kumar S. Colussi P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For example, caspase-2 and caspase-9 contain caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) in their prodomain, whereas caspase-8 and caspase-10 contain two copies of death effector domains (DEDs) (6Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Ni J. Gentz R. Mann N. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M.

Cytochrome c- and dATP-dependent oligomerization of Apaf-1, followed by interaction of oligomerized Apaf-1 with procaspase-9, results in proximity-induced activation of caspase-9 (11Li P. Nijhawan D.

One of the DEDs in caspase-8 interacts with the DED in the adaptor FADD, a molecule that helps recruit procaspase-8 to activated death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family (6Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Ni J. Gentz R. Mann N. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M.

Again, this adaptor-mediated recruitment of the procaspase molecules is believed to be sufficient for caspase activation (8Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Once the caspases containing long prodomains are activated, they are believed to activate downstream caspases that lack specific protein-protein interaction domains, thereby initiating a cascade of caspase activation (1Kumar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 198-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 2Cryns V. Yuan J.

Dredd and Dronc contain long prodomains carrying DEDs and a CARD, respectively, suggesting that these two caspases may act as upstream caspases. Strica also contains a long prodomain, but it lacks any CARD/DED sequences. On the other hand, Dcp-1, Drice, Decay, and Damm lack long prodomains and are thus similar to downstream effector caspases in mammals. A dcp-1 mutation results in larval lethality and melanotic tumors (26Song Z. McCall K. Steller H. Science. 1997; 275: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Additionally, dcp-1mutants show a defect in transfer of nurse cell cytoplasmic contents to developing oocytes, suggesting that dcp-1 may also be required for Drosophila oogenesis (34McCall K. Steller H. Science. 1998; 279: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because no mutants for other Drosophila caspases are currently available, their precise functions remain unknown. However, a number of indirect observations point to a role for other Drosophila caspases in apoptosis in vivo. For example, dredd mRNA accumulates in embryonic cells undergoing programmed cell death and in nurse cells in the ovary at a time that coincides with nurse cell death (27Chen P. Rodriguez A. Erskine R. Thach T. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), dronc mRNA, although widely expressed during development, is up-regulated by ecdysone in larval salivary glands and midgut before histolysis of these tissues (30Dorstyn L. Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and antibody depletion experiments suggest that Drice is required for apoptotic activity in the S2 Drosophila cell line (35Fraser A.G. McCarthy N.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6192-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a deficiency uncovering dredd dominantly suppresses the ablated eye phenotype due to ectopic expression of rpr, hid, orgrim, and a mini-gene of dredd reverses this suppression, showing that dredd is important for PCDin vivo (27Chen P. Rodriguez A. Erskine R. Thach T. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that overexpression of Dronc induces cell death in mammalian cells (30Dorstyn L. Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In two recent studies (36Meier P. Silke J. Leevers S.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 37Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Peterson E.P. Wang S.L. Vernooy S.Y. Hay B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27084-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been shown that ectopic expression of dronc promotes apoptosis in the developing Drosophila eye that can be suppressed by co-expression of diap1. Furthermore, in yeast, Diap1 inhibited Dronc activity, and this inhibition was abrogated by co-expression of Hid or Grim (37Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Peterson E.P. Wang S.L. Vernooy S.Y. Hay B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27084-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diap1 binds to the prodomain of Dronc, and, consistent with this, expression of a truncated version of Dronc lacking the prodomain resulted in a more severe ablated eye phenotype that could not be rescued by co-expression of Diap1 (36Meier P. Silke J. Leevers S.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These studies also showed that a mutated version of dronc(containing a mutation in the caspase active site) acted in a dominant negative manner to suppress rpr- and hid-induced cell death (36Meier P. Silke J. Leevers S.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Likewise, a deficiency removing the droncgene was able to dominantly suppress rpr- andhid-induced cell death in the eye (36Meier P. Silke J. Leevers S.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), showing that Dronc mediates cell death by Rpr and Hid. In addition, these studies showed that Dronc associates with the effector caspase Drice and is able to process Drice to the active form (36Meier P. Silke J. Leevers S.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 37Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Peterson E.P. Wang S.L. Vernooy S.Y. Hay B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27084-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it was found that Dronc activity was not inhibited by the baculoviral caspase inhibitor P35, nor could Dronc cleave P35 (36Meier P. Silke J. Leevers S.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 37Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Peterson E.P. Wang S.L. Vernooy S.Y. Hay B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27084-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of dronc at various developmental stages results in apoptosis. As demonstrated previously (36Meier P. Silke J. Leevers S.J. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 37Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Peterson E.P. Wang S.L. Vernooy S.Y. Hay B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27084-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we show that dronc overexpression results in an ablated eye phenotype that can be modified by halving or increasing the dosage of diap1. In addition, we show that the dronc eye phenotype can be suppressed by reducing the dosage of the H99 complex genes or of theAPAF-1/ced-4 homolog, dark. In contrast to previous studies, we show that the dronc eye ablation phenotype can be blocked by co-expression of the baculoviral caspase inhibitor p35 (13Abrams J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 435-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Confirming these genetic interactions, Dronc can form complexes with Diap1, Grim, Dark, and P35; however, the interaction between Dronc and Grim or P35 is indirect. We also show that Dark is required for Dronc activation because Dronc is poorly processed in extracts from Dark homozygous mutant flies. Because specific dronc mutants are currently unavailable, we used the technique of RNA interference (RNAi) to ablate droncmRNA in embryos. Our results show that Dronc is essential for cell death during embryogenesis and suggest a central function for Dronc in the cell death effector machinery in Drosophila. Wild type dronc or the dronc C318G(dronc CG) mutant constructs tagged with GFP were cloned into the pUAST plasmid (38Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by ligating aNotI-EcoRI fragment containingdronc-GFP from pEGFPN1-dronc orpEGFPN1-dronc CG (30Dorstyn L. Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) into the corresponding sites of pUAST. Transgenic flies were generated as described previously (39Richardson H. O'Keefe L.V. Marty T. Saint R. Development. 1995; 121: 3371-3379PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of UAS-dronc orUAS-dronc CG were crossed to the eye-specific enhancer GMR-GAL4 to analyze the eye phenotype. Many of theUAS-dronc lines were lethal at 25 °C, whereas other lines gave only a few adult survivors with severe eye defects. None of theUAS-dronc CG lines resulted in lethality or eye defects when crossed to GMR-GAL4. Two less severe lines,UAS-dronc#80 and UAS-dronc#23 (both of which contained a double insert of the transgene on the second and third chromosome), were used for genetic analysis. For both of these lines, recombinants were generated containing UAS-dronc andGMR-GAL4 (second chromosome) and were made homozygous for the UAS-dronc insert on the third chromosome. For genetic interaction tests, both UAS-dronc GMR-GAL4 lines were crossed at 25 °C or 29 °C to wild type (w 1118) flies or strains containingGMR-p35; GMR-diap1; GMR-diap2 (15Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A.

To test the interaction of a dronc deficiency (Df(3L)AC1 at 67A2–67D13) with GMR-hid (40Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Agapite J. White K. Steller H. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1694-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) or GMR-rpr (41White K. Tahaoglu E. Steller H. Science. 1996; 271: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), crosses were carried out at 25 °C and 18 °C, respectively. Progeny were scored by examining the eye phenotypes using light or scanning electron microscopes, as described previously (42Secombe J. Pispa J. Saint R. Richardson H. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1867-1882PubMed Google Scholar). Deficiency, GMR-p35 (third chromosome) andl(2)k11502 stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center. A fragment of dronc cDNA encoding the 126 carboxyl-terminal amino acids was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the EcoRI site ofpGEX-4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate aGST-dronc fusion construct. The GST-Dronc fusion protein was purified and used to inoculate rabbits. GST-interacting antibodies were removed by passing serum through a GST-Sepharose column. αDronc polyclonal antibodies were further purified by affinity chromatography using a Dronc-antigen column. The analysis of the interaction of Dronc with Diap1, Diap2, Rpr, Grim, or Hid was carried out in mammalian 293T cells after cotransfection of pcDNA3- dronc-GFP either of the constructs pcDNA3-diap1-HA, pcDNA3-diap2-myc, pcDNA3-rpr-flag,pcDNA3-hid-flag or pcDNA3-grim-flag, or transfection of pcDNA3-dronc-GFP alone. For the Dronc and P35 interaction, Schneider L2 (SL2) cells were transfected with HA- and 6xHis-tagged Dronc and HA-tagged P35, both inpRmHa.3 vector. After induction of expression by CuSO4 (23Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Huang D.C.S. Coombe M. Read S.H. Richardson H. Kumar S. J.

To analyze the Dronc/Dark interaction, SL2 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Dark(1–411) alone or with FLAG-tagged Dronc. Myc-tagged Dark(1–411) was immunoprecipitated with an αMyc antibody and pelleted protein complexes, and the original lysates were analyzed after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by immunoblotting with an αFLAG antibody. pMT-dark(1–411) has been described previously (20Rodriguez A.

Inohara) intopMT vector. Cell culture and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (23Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Huang D.C.S. Coombe M. Read S.H. Richardson H. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Full-length P35HA, GrimFLAG, and Diap1MYC were in vitrotranslated from pCDNA3 templates using the TNT T7 coupled Reticulolysate Lysate System (Promega). P35HA and GrimFLAG were purified by immunoprecipitating overnight at 4 °C in a total volume of 400 μl of caspase assay buffer (0.1m Hepes, pH 7, 0.1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid, 10% polyethelene glycol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Proteins were pulled down with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and unbound protein was washed off with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.025% Triton X-100). 5 μl of P35HA and GrimFLAG immobilized on protein G-Sepharose was added to purified Dronc-GST and/or35S-labeled Diap1 in a total volume of 400 μl of caspase assay buffer. After incubation at 4 °C for 3 h, beads were washed twice with 100 volumes of wash buffer and twice in 100 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS-T (5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20). Blots were probed with purified anti-Dronc polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:200 for 2 h at room temperature. This was followed by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. Signals were detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Full-length Dronc was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into theEcoRI site of pGEX4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmid pGEX4T1-dronc was then transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells. After induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h, the Dronc-GST fusion protein was prepared from the soluble fraction and affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose as per the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein lysates were prepared as follows: wild type (w 1118) ordark CD8 adult flies were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized using a mortar and pestle. Approximately 10–20 lysed flies were resuspended in 300–500 μl of caspase assay buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were then removed and centrifuged again for 10 min. The protein concentration of lysates was determined using the BCA kit as per the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). A total of 100 μg of protein from cleared lysates was assayed for caspase activity by incubating it with 100 μmDEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumaride (amc) (Enzyme System Products), VDVAD-amc (California Peptide Research), or VEID-amc (Bachem) in a volume of 40 μl in caspase assay buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. Fluorescence was quantified on a Luminescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; excitation, 385 nm; emission, 460 nm). The cDNA constructpOT2-dronc was used as a template for the production of [35S]methionine (ICN)-labeled Dronc protein using the TNT T7 coupled Reticulolysate Lysate System (Promega). 5 μl of labeled protein was incubated in proteolysis assays at 37 °C for 3 h with protein extracts prepared from wild type ordark CD8 flies (100 μg of total protein) in caspase assay buffer in a total volume of 20 μl. An equal volume of 2× protein loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 0.2% bromophenol blue) was then added, and proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and cleavage products were resolved by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using semi-dry apparatus (Biometra) and visualized by autoradiography. SL2 cells were maintained in Schneider Cell Medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 27 °C. For cell death assays, 2 × 106 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes in 2 ml of medium the day before transfection. Cells were co-transfected with 1.5 μg of vector or pMT-dronc (wild type, C318G mutant, or minus prodomain (MPD) containing amino acid residues 114–450 from Dronc) and 0.5 μg of the heat shock-inducible pCasper.hs-lacZ reporter using Cellfectin reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Where indicated, pMT-MPD was co-transfected with pMT-p35, diap1, diap2, ordronc C318G expression constructs at a ratio of 1:2. Sixteen h after transfection, cells were heat shocked at 37 °C for 30 min and then allowed 30 min of recovery time at 27 °C. This was repeated another two times. After heat shock, cells were split into halves in two 35-mm dishes, and one dish was treated with 0.7 mm CuSO4. Where indicated, 50 μmz-VAD-fluoromethylketone (Enzyme Systems Inc.) was added to cells at the time of CuSO4 addition. Forty-eight h after CuSO4 induction, cells were stained for β-galactosidase, and the survival percentage was calculated as the percentage of β-galactosidase-positive cells in CuSO4-treated cells relative to the percentage of β-galactosidase-positive cells in untreated dishes. Antibody staining of Drosophila tissues was performed as described previously (42Secombe J. Pispa J. Saint R. Richardson H. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1867-1882PubMed Google Scholar). The 22C10 antibody developed by S. Benzer (Department of Biology, Caltech, Pasadena, CA) was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa. Acridine orange staining (43Abrams J.M. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Development. 1993; 117: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and TUNEL assays (44Chen P. Nordstrom W. Gish B. Abrams J.M.

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of hTERTexpression are still not fully understood. We have previously cloned and characterized the genomic sequences and promoter of thehTERT gene. Here, we provide evidence that histone deacetylation is involved in the repression of hTERT in human cells. Inhibition of histone deacetylases by trichostatin A in telomerase-negative cells resulted in activation of telomerase activity and up-regulation of hTERT mRNA. Transient transfection experiments with a reporter under control of thehTERT promoter indicated that this promoter can be activated by trichostatin A. Finally, our results show that repression of the hTERT promoter by the Mad protein requires histone deacetylase activity, whereas de-repression by trichostatin A is independent of the E-boxes located in its core region.

Cech T.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Telomeres are essential for the complete replication of chromosomes and for their stability. Because of the inability of conventional DNA polymerases to fully replicate the 3′ end of the lagging strand of linear molecules, telomeric sequences are progressively lost with cell division. This loss, which results in telomere shortening, is thought to act as a molecular clock that controls the replicative capacity of cells and their entry into senescence (2Harley C.B. Kim N.W. Prowse K.R. Weinrich S.E. Hirsch K.S. West M.D. Bacchetti S. Hirte H.W. Counter C.M. Greider C.W. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). One mechanism to overcome this control is the activation of telomerase, an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that synthesizes telomeric DNA de novo and thus compensates for the sequence loss occurring during semi-conservative DNA replication (1Lingner J. Cech T.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In human, telomerase is active during embryonic development, in adult germ line tissues, and in essentially all malignancies, but with the exception of stem cells, it is not expressed in somatic cells (3Oulton R. Harrington L. Curr. Opin. Oncology. 2000; 12: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The human telomerase core enzyme consists of an essential structural RNA (hTER)1 with a template domain for telomeric DNA synthesis and of a catalytic protein (hTERT) with reverse transcriptase activity (3Oulton R. Harrington L. Curr. Opin. Oncology. 2000; 12: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 4Price C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The telomerase-associated protein, TEP1, is also a component of the telomerase complex, but its function remains unclear. hTER and TEP1 are constitutively expressed in all cells and are therefore not likely to be involved in the regulation of telomerase activity (3Oulton R. Harrington L. Curr. Opin. Oncology. 2000; 12: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 5Liu J.P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). On the other hand, expression of hTERT parallels that of telomerase activity. In vitro and in vivo reconstitution of telomerase has demonstrated that hTERT is the rate-limiting determinant of enzymatic activity (6Weinrich S.L. Pruzan R. Ma L. Ouellette M. Tesmer V.M. Holt S.E.

In addition, ectopic expression of hTERT in normal cells results in telomere maintenance and life-span extension (8Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B.

Oncogene. 1998; 8: 279-282Google Scholar), whereas inhibition of the enzyme in immortal cells is lethal (10Zhang X. Mar V. Zhou W. Harrington L. Robinson M.O.

Although recent studies indicate that the regulation of telomerase activity is multifactorial in mammalian cells (5Liu J.P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2091-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), transcriptional regulation of hTERT appears to be the primary mode of control. The recent cloning and characterization of thehTERT gene and its promoter has provided essential reagents to study the molecular mechanisms of telomerase regulation (13Cong Y.S. Wen J. Bacchetti S. Hum. Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 14Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari R.A. Barrett J.C.

Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has revealed that the hTERT promoter is highly GC-rich, lacks TATA and CAAT boxes, but contains binding sites for a numbers of transcription factors including the Myc/Mad binding site (E-box) and estrogen response elements. Although the GC content of the promoter suggested that methylation could be involved in promoter repression in normal cells, recent reports (17Devereux T.R. Horikawa I. Anna C.H. Annab L.A. Afshari A. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6078-6090Google Scholar, 18Dessain S.K., Yu, H.Y. Reddel R.R. Beijersbergen R.L. Weinberg R.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 537-541PubMed Google Scholar) and our unpublished data do not support this hypothesis. We and others have recently shown that estrogen and its receptor activate telomerase in estrogen-responsive cells through the estrogen response element sites in the hTERT promoter (19Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar, 20Misiti S. Nanni S. Fontemaggi G. Cong Y.S. Wen J. Hirte H.W. Piaggio G. Sacchi A. Pontecorvi A. Bacchetti S. Farsetti A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3764-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It has been also demonstrated that the Myc and Mad proteins, respectively, can activate or repress the hTERT promoter through their interaction with the E-boxes (21Wang J. Xie L.Y. Allan S. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1769-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 22Oh S. Song Y.H. Yim J. Kim T.K.

These findings, and the abundance of potentially regulatory motifs in the hTERT promoter, are compatible with the possibility that this promoter may be subject to multiple levels of control and may even be regulated by different factors in different cellular contexts. Recent studies have provided molecular evidence that modifications of chromatin structure are of fundamental importance in gene regulation. Histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases are known to interact with components of the transcription machinery, causing promoter-specific alteration of chromatin (24Davie J.R. Spencer V.A. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32/33: 141-148Crossref Google Scholar). A number of transcription factors can associate with histone acetyltransferases, which stimulate transcription by acetylating histone and disrupting nucleosome structure. Conversely, several other factors have been shown to interact with histone deacetylases, whose activity leads to nucleosome formation and promoter repression (25Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 26Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we provide evidence that histone deacetylases are involved in repression of thehTERT promoter through at least two mechanisms: one is mediated by Mad, and a second is independent of the presence of E-boxes in the promoter sequences. Human fibroblasts WI-38, MRC-5, and BJ and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells are telomerase-negative normal cells (8Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B.

HA1 are SV40-transformed HEK cells that do not express telomerase activity prior to immortalization but become telomerase-positive after immortalization (HA1-IM) (29Counter C.M. Avilion A.A.

HT1080 and HeLa cells are telomerase-positive tumor-derived cell lines. All cells were cultured in α-MEM (minimal essential medium) with 10% fetal calf serum. For experimental purposes, trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma) dissolved in Me2SO was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml for 24 h; a corresponding volume of Me2SO was added to control cultures. p3996del was generated from p3996 (13Cong Y.S.

Plasmid p181, containing the core promoter of hTERT, and its derivatives Myc-MT1 and Myc-MT2 (with individually mutated E-boxes) and Sp1-MT1-5 (with mutation of 5 Sp1 sites) (30Kyo S. Takakura M.

Plasmid Myc MT1+2 was generated by subcloning aSacII-BglII fragment from Myc-MT2 into the corresponding sites of Myc-MT1; Myc-MT1+2 contains mutations in both E-boxes of the hTERT promoter. pSPMad and pSPMadpro were obtained from R. Eisenman (Fred Hutchinson Research Center, Seattle) and encode a wild type or a mutated inactive form of Mad (26Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell.

Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) on triplicate cultures using 2 μg of each plasmid/plate and were repeated at least three times. When required, TSA was added 5 h after transfection. Transfected cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, and cells extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using reagents and protocols from Promega. Enzymatic activity was normalized to amount of protein. Cell extracts were prepared by detergent lysis, and enzymatic activity was detected by the PCR-based telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) (31Kim N.M. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B.

Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated with DNase I prior to cDNA synthesis. Briefly, a 30-μl reaction containing 2 μg of total RNA, 6 μl of 5× first-strand buffer, 2 units of DNase I, and 1 μl of RNasin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then heated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate the enzyme. Half of the treated RNA was used for RT-PCR analysis ofhTERT mRNA using 200 ng of LT5 primer (32Nakamura T.M. Morin G.B. Chapman K.B. Weinrich S.L. Andrews W.H. Lingner J. Harley C.B. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 277: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar) and Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR amplification of 145 bp ofhTERT cDNA was performed with primers and conditions described by Ulaner et al. (33Ulaner G.A. Hu J.F. Vu T.H. Giudice L.C. Hoffman A.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4168-4172PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining half of the RNA was used for RT-PCR of GAPDH mRNA (32Nakamura T.M. Morin G.B. Chapman K.B. Weinrich S.L. Andrews W.H. Lingner J. Harley C.B. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 277: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). Amplified PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) and visualized under UV light. To investigate whether histone deacetylation is involved in the repression of hTERT in human somatic cells, normal BJ fibroblasts, HEK cells, and SV40-transformed HA1 cells, all of which are telomerase/hTERT-negative, were treated with TSA, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases. As shown in Fig. 1 A, telomerase activity was readily detectable in all three cell types following TSA treatment. When used on telomerase-positive cells (Fig. 1 B), TSA was unable to enhance telomerase activity in HT1080 or HeLa cells, both of which express abundant amounts of this enzyme. On the other hand, a reproducible increase in telomerase activity (3–4-fold) was detected in HA1-IM cells, which express constitutively low levels of telomerase (13Cong Y.S. Wen J. Bacchetti S. Hum. Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 34Avilion A.A. Piatyszek M.A. Gupta J. Shay J.W. Bacchetti S. Greider C.W Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 645-650PubMed Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that telomerase repression in normal cells can be reversed by inhibition of deacetylases and further indicate that a deacetylation-dependent degree of repression can persist in immortal cells.Figure 1Telomerase activity and hTERT transcription are induced by TSA treatment. A, normal BJ and HEK cells and telomerase-negative HA1-transformed cells were cultured in the presence (+) or absence (−) of TSA for 24 h, and 10 μg of cell extracts were assayed for telomerase activity.Blank is a control reaction without cell extract.B, the indicated amounts of cell extracts from telomerase-positive HT1080, HeLa, and HA1-IM cells treated with (+) or without (−) TSA, as described in A, were assayed for telomerase activity.

C, hTERTtranscriptional activation by TSA. hTERT mRNA levels were measured in TSA-treated (+) and untreated (−) cells by RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was used for normalization of RT-PCR efficiency.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The levels of hTERT mRNA were measured in TSA-treated and untreated cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 1 C). ThehTERT message was not detectable in human fibroblasts BJ, MRC5, and WI38, or in HEK and HA1 cells, and was weakly expressed in HA1-IM cells. Treatment with TSA up-regulatedhTERT mRNA expression in all cell types. Although these results do not rule out the possibility that TSA indirectly enhances the stability of the hTERT mRNA, they strongly suggest that induction of telomerase by this compound may be caused by de-repression of hTERT transcription. This conclusion is fully supported by transient transfection experiments (see below) demonstrating that TSA enhances the transcriptional activity of thehTERT promoter. We have previously shown that hTERT promoter activity is contained within a DNA fragment of 3996 bp upstream of the hTERT ATG (13Cong Y.S. Wen J. Bacchetti S. Hum. Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This promoter has a high GC content and lacks detectable TATA or CAAT boxes but contains an abundance of binding sites for several transcription factors (13Cong Y.S. Wen J. Bacchetti S. Hum. Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Core promoter activity has been mapped to a fragment of less than 300 bp upstream of the ATG, which contains two E-boxes and five Sp1 sites that are involved in promoter regulation (13Cong Y.S.

To further define the effects of histone deacetylation onhTERT repression, we transiently transfected HA1 and HA1-IM cells with p3996del, which encodes luciferase under control of the 3996 bp hTERT promoter (Fig.2 A). As previously shown (13Cong Y.S. Wen J. Bacchetti S. Hum. Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), the activity of this promoter correlates with the presence of telomerase. Thus, only background levels of luciferase were detected in untreated HA1 cells, but treatment with TSA resulted in a 16-fold increase in activity (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were observed with HEK, BJ, and MRC5 normal human cells (data not shown). As expected, luciferase was expressed in transfected HA1-IM cells even in the absence of TSA. Addition of the inhibitor, however, resulted in a 4.5-fold increase in activity (Fig. 2 B), in agreement with the observed enhancement of telomerase activity and of hTERTmRNA. These results further indicate that active repression ofhTERT requires histone deacetylase activity. Recent studies have shown that Mad represses thehTERT promoter by competing with Myc for binding to E-boxes (22Oh S. Song Y.H. Yim J. Kim T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 23Günes Ç. Lichtsteiner S. Vasserot A.P. Englert C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2116-2121PubMed Google Scholar). The members of the Myc network, which are central to the control of cell growth and development, regulate diverse processes such as cell transformation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Myc and Mad can form heterodimers with Max, which also binds to E-boxes. Whereas the Myc:Max complex activates transcription and promotes cell proliferation and transformation, Mad:Max heterodimers repress transcription and block Myc-mediated cell transformation (25Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 26Ayer D.E. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Repression by the Mad:Max complex is thought to be mediated by chromatin condensation through the recruitment of histone deacetylases (28Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Devie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). We reasoned that in such case, inhibition of these enzymes could block the Mad-dependent repression of the hTERT promoter. As shown in Fig. 3, treatment with TSA was again found to enhance luciferase activity (here, by about 5-fold) in HA1-IM cells transfected with p3996del. Cotransfection of the Mad expressing plasmid pSPMad resulted in repression of promoter activity. In turn, this repression was significantly alleviated by treatment with TSA. As expected, cotransfection of pSPMadpro encoding mutant Mad did not repress the hTERT promoter. Interestingly, we repeatedly observed that induction of luciferase activity by TSA was much more pronounced in cells cotransfected with the Mad mutant than in those receiving wild type Mad. The reasons for this effect are not clear at present. Our data confirm those of others (22Oh S. Song Y.H. Yim J. Kim T.K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1485-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 23Günes Ç. Lichtsteiner S. Vasserot A.P. Englert C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2116-2121PubMed Google Scholar) showing that Mad represses the hTERT promoter, and they further show that this repression requires the activity of histone deacetylases, which may be recruited by Mad repressor complexes bound to the E-boxes within the promoter. We queried whether, in addition to E-boxes, there are other cis-elements in the hTERT promoter that are able to recruit histone deacetylases. To this end, we transiently transfected wild type and mutant hTERT promoter/reporter constructs (30Kyo S. Takakura M. Taira T. Kanaya T. Itoh H. Yutsudo M. Ariga H. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) into HA1 cells. As previously shown for the larger promoter in p3996del, expression of luciferase under control of thehTERT core promoter (p181, containing 258 bp of hTERT regulatory sequences upstream of the ATG, Fig. 2 A) was at background level in these cells but was dramatically induced upon treatment with TSA (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the p181 derivative with mutations of both E-boxes (Myc MT1+2) was still capable of responding to TSA treatment to the same extent as the wild type promoter. This result suggests that histone deacetylases may indeed be tethered to the hTERT promoter bycis-regulatory elements other than E-boxes. Potential candidates would be Sp1 sites, which have recently been shown to interact with deacetylases to repress transcription (35Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). There are in fact five Sp1 sites between the two E-boxes of the corehTERT promoter (Fig. 2 A (30Kyo S. Takakura M. Taira T. Kanaya T. Itoh H. Yutsudo M. Ariga H. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar)); however, mutations of these sites abolish promoter activity (data not shown (30Kyo S. Takakura M. Taira T. Kanaya T. Itoh H. Yutsudo M. Ariga H. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar)). Microcell fusion experiments have identified several human chromosome loci capable of repressing telomerase activity in diverse cellular context (36Shay J.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our findings that histone deacetylases are involved in the silencing of the hTERT promoter, via a mechanism that is independent of E-boxes and Mad, leaves open the possibility that these enzymes may be recruited to this promoter by one or more of the still uncharacterized hTERT repressors.

https://openalex.org/W2078993960,"Abstract Type I interferons bind to two cell surface receptors, ifnar1 and ifnar2, as the first step in the activation of several signal transduction pathways that elicit an anti-viral state and an anti-proliferative response. Here, we quantitatively mapped the complete binding region of ifnar2 on interferon (IFN)α2 by 35 individual mutations to alanine and isosteric residues. Of the six “hot-spot” residues identified (Leu-30, Arg-33, Arg-144, Ala-145, Met-148, and Arg-149), four are located on the E-helix, which is located at the center of the binding site flanked by residues on the A-helix and the AB-loop. The contribution of residues of the D-helix, which have been previously implicated in binding, proved to be marginal for the interaction with the extracellular domain of ifnar2. Interestingly, the ifnar2 binding site overlaps the largest continuous hydrophobic patch on IFNα2. Thus, hydrophobic interactions seem to play a significant role stabilizing this interaction, with the charged residues contributing toward the rapid association of the complex. Relating the anti-viral and anti-proliferative activity of the various interferon mutants with their affinity toward ifnar2 results in linear function over the whole range of affinities investigated, suggesting that ifnar2 binding is the rate-determining step in cellular activation. Dose-time analysis of the anti-viral response revealed that shortening the incubation time of low-level activation cannot be compensated by higher IFN doses. Considering the strict dependence of the cellular response on affinity, these results suggest that for maintaining transcription of IFN-responsive genes over a longer time period, low but continuous signaling through the IFN receptor is essential."
https://openalex.org/W1998422466,"Recent studies describe a network of signaling proteins centered around Goα and Gqα that regulates neurotransmitter secretion in C. elegans by controlling the production and consumption of diacylglycerol (DAG). We sought other components of the Goα–Gqα signaling network by screening for aldicarb-resistant mutants with phenotypes similar to egl-30 (Gqα) mutants. In so doing, we identified ric-8, which encodes a novel protein named RIC-8 (synembryn). Through cDNA analysis, we show that RIC-8 is conserved in vertebrates. Through immunostaining, we show that RIC-8 is concentrated in the cytoplasm of neurons. Exogenous application of phorbol esters or loss of DGK-1 (diacylglycerol kinase) rescues ric-8 mutant phenotypes. A genetic analysis suggests that RIC-8 functions upstream of, or in conjunction with, EGL-30 (Gqα)."

Thus, an active mismatch repair system ensures the precision of chromosomal replication and maintains genomic stability (for reviews, see Refs. 1Modrich P. Annu. Rev.

Consistent with this idea, defects in mismatch repair genes in human cells have been linked to genomic instability and hereditary colon cancer, underscoring the importance of this repair pathway (6Eshleman J.R.

The sequence of biochemical reactions that define the mismatch repair pathway has been well described in E. coli, and the proteins responsible for each step are known (for reviews, see Refs. 1Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 2Modrich P. Science. 1994; 266: 1959-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 3Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev.

MutL, also a dimer, then binds the MutS·DNA complex (12Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the DNA is looped out in an active search for the nearest d(GATC) methylation site either 5′ or 3′ of the mismatch (12Grilley M.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Once found, the complex stimulates MutH to generate a nick on the unmethylated (or nascent) strand at the hemimethylated d(GATC) site (14Au K.G. Welsh K.M. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 435-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 16Welsh K.M. Lu A.L. Clark S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), beginning at the nick and continuing past the mismatch (18Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1gap is filled by DNA polymerase III, and DNA ligase seals the remaining nick (19Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Importantly, the mismatch repair reaction pathway has bidirectional capability. The nick is generated at the d(GATC) site located closest to the mismatch and therefore could exist on either side of the mismatch (18Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, DNA helicase II unwinds DNA with a specific 3′ to 5′ polarity (20Matson S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, helicase II must be loaded on the appropriate DNA strand to ensure unwinding toward the mismatch. It is also important to note that the d(GATC) site nearest an error may be >1 kilobase away (19Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The precise biochemical activity associated with the MutL protein has been a matter of debate for several years. Some groups have demonstrated that MutL binds to both ssDNA and double-stranded DNA (21Ban C. Junop M. Yang W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is now clear that MutL catalyzes a weak ATPase reaction and that this activity is required for mismatch repair (21Ban C. Junop M. Yang W.

Escherichia coli DNA Helicase II: Structure-function Analysis of Conserved Amino Acid Motifs and Investigation of Protein-Protein Interactions. Ph.D. thesis. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill1998Google Scholar). Thus, MutL has been suggested to function as a master coordinator or molecular matchmaker in the mismatch repair pathway (1Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 29Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Of particular interest is the fact that MutL specifically stimulates the unwinding reaction catalyzed by DNA helicase II (theuvrD gene product) (27Hall M.H. Escherichia coli DNA Helicase II: Structure-function Analysis of Conserved Amino Acid Motifs and Investigation of Protein-Protein Interactions. Ph.D. thesis. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill1998Google Scholar, 29Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The unwinding activity of the Rep protein (40% identical to UvrD) is enhanced by MutL, but to a significantly lower extent (29Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, on a nicked circular heteroduplex DNA substrate, MutL and MutS together activate UvrD-catalyzed unwinding, whereas there is no detectable enhancement of unwinding by Rep helicase (29Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, stimulation of the UvrD-catalyzed unwinding reaction by MutL is specific and likely due to a protein-protein interaction. This is consistent with data demonstrating a physical interaction between these two proteins (25Spampinato C. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9863-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism by which the UvrD-catalyzed unwinding reaction is enhanced by MutL. However, important details of the reaction have been described. For example, on a nicked circular molecule containing a mismatch, MutS, MutL, and UvrD initiate unwinding at the nick site and begin helix opening in the direction toward the mismatch. This reaction requires all three protein components and the presence of a mismatch (31Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, although MutL dramatically stimulates the unwinding rate by DNA helicase II, MutL does not increase the ATP hydrolysis rate of helicase II (26Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for stimulation of UvrD-catalyzed unwinding by MutL has been investigated. The experiments described here support a model in which MutL loads UvrD onto the DNA substrate, increasing the rate of initiation. In addition, MutL-directed loading of UvrD is observed to be continuous. A model for methyl-directed mismatch repair is presented that incorporates the observed biochemical and physical interactions between MutL and UvrD. E. coli BL21 was from Novagen.

This protein was used for nitrocellulose filter binding experiments. Additional MutL was purified from a strain lacking MutS, GE1752ΔmutS. MutL was overexpressed prior to purification by growing GE1752ΔmutS containing pCYB2-mutL in 2× yeast-tryptone medium at 30 °C. Cells were grown to an absorbance of 1.0 (600 nm). Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. For purification from GE1752ΔmutS containing pCYB2-mutL, 19.5 g of cells were harvested by centrifugation. pCYB2-mutL generates the MutL protein as an intein fusion. MutL was purified using a chitin column (Impact I system, New England Biolabs Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein was eluted with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 25 °C), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA supplemented with 0.2 m NaCl and 30 mm dithiothreitol. Pooled fractions were diluted with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA) to a conductivity equivalent to that of buffer A + 0.1 m NaCl. The pool was loaded onto a 10-ml DEAE-Sephadex column (2.7-cm internal diameter; Sigma) that had been equilibrated with buffer A + 0.1 m NaCl. Protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.6 mNaCl in buffer A. Protein eluted at a conductivity equivalent to that of buffer A + 0.13 m NaCl. Pooled fractions (8 ml) were concentrated by solution absorption with polyethylene glycol 20,000. Fractions were placed in a dialysis bag with a molecular weight cutoff of 3500. The dialysis bag was covered with polyethylene glycol 20,000. Then, 3 ml of concentrated protein material were extensively dialyzed into MutL storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The concentration of helicase II was determined using the published extinction coefficient of 1.29 ml mg−1cm−1 (35Runyon G.T. Wong I. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 602-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The concentration of MutL was determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. A 148-bp blunt duplex DNA fragment was produced by digestion of pLitmus28 with XbaI andPvuII and purified from an agarose gel using Geneclean (Bio 101, Inc.). The purified DNA fragment was radioactively labeled by filling in the XbaI site with [α-32P]dCTP, dTTP, dATP, and dGTP using DNA polymerase I (large fragment). After phenol/chloroform extraction, the DNA fragment was separated from unincorporated nucleotides using a Sephadex G-50 column (Sigma). The concentration of the final product was estimated assuming an 80% yield. The 750-bp blunt duplex DNA fragment was prepared by digestion of pLitmus28 with DraI, followed by treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to produce 5′-OH. The fragment was isolated from an agarose gel using Geneclean and was subsequently labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The DNA fragment was purified as described above using an A-5m column (Bio-Rad). The concentration was estimated as indicated above. The 20-bp partial duplex substrate used in single-turnover assays was prepared by labeling the single-stranded 20-mer with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled 20-mer was mixed in annealing buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 22 °C), and 1 mmMgCl2) with M13mp7 ssDNA at a 1:1 molar ratio. The annealing mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by successive 20-min incubations at 65, 42, and 22 °C. The 92-bp partial duplex used in single-turnover assays was annealed as described above prior to labeling with [α-32P]dCTP as described previously (36Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following labeling and annealing, DNA substrates were diluted to 100 μl in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 25 °C), and 1 mm EDTA and phenol/chloroform-extracted. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a Sephadex G-50 spin column as described (37Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (2000) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, pp. 3.4.10 3.4.11, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Concentrations were estimated assuming an 85% yield. The 851- and 92-bp partial duplex substrates used in standard helicase and nitrocellulose filter binding assays were prepared as described previously (36Brosh Jr., R.M. Matson S.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of UvrD, MutL, and UvrD + MutL to DNA was evaluated by measuring the retention of a [32P]DNA ligand on nitrocellulose filters as described previously (38Hall M.C. Ozsoy A.Z. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 39Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2281-2287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were done using a32P-labeled 90-mer (0.4 nm molecules; 36 nm nucleotide phosphate) or a 92-bp partial duplex substrate (0.17 nm molecules; 1.2 μmnucleotide phosphate). Reaction mixtures contained 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 22 °C), 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (reaction buffer). These experiments contained the indicated concentrations of UvrD and/or MutL. Proteins were diluted in helicase II storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at 22 °C), 0.2 m NaCl, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mmEGTA). Equilibrium binding experiments were done in 20-μl reactions. UvrD and MutL were premixed. Reaction tubes were prewarmed for 30 s at 37 °C and initiated by the addition of premixed protein. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and diluted with 1 ml of reaction buffer without bovine serum albumin immediately before filtration. The entire reaction was then filtered. Reactions were filtered using the double-filter technique (40Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) over nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore Corp.) and NA45-DEAE filters (Schleicher & Schüll). Nitrocellulose filters (38Hall M.C. Ozsoy A.Z. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and DEAE filters (40Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) were prepared as described and rinsed with 1 ml of reaction buffer with bovine serum albumin prior to application of the reaction mixtures. Reactions were filtered at a flow rate of ∼2 ml/min. Filters were washed two times with 1 ml of reaction buffer and dried for liquid scintillation counting. Total radioactivity was determined for each titration or time point as the sum of radioactivity on the nitrocellulose filter and the DEAE filter. Background values, determined from nitrocellulose filters of no-protein controls, were typically <1% of the total counts. Relative macroscopicKD values were calculated from equilibrium binding data by fitting the equation for a rectangular hyperbola to the data. Data fitting was done using the nonlinear least-squares technique and SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Error values in binding constants were generated by SigmaPlot. Gel shift reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 22 °C), 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.7 nm32P-labeled 48-base oligonucleotide (32 nmnucleotide phosphate), and 1 mm AMP-PNP. Proteins were diluted in helicase II storage buffer, premixed, and incubated on ice before initiation by the addition of the other reaction components. All reactions were incubated for 20 min on ice, followed by the addition of 5 μl of 75% (v/v) glycerol to all reaction tubes and loading dyes to the control tube that contained only the oligonucleotide. Glycerol or dyes did not alter the apparent migration of the ssDNA oligonucleotide (data not shown). Samples were immediately loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel (67:1 cross-linking ratio) containing 50 mm Tris, 50 mm borate, and 2.5 mm EDTA. Samples were electrophoresed at constant voltage (8 V/cm) until the bromphenol blue marker had migrated to ∼1 inch from the bottom of the gel. Results were visualized using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Standard helicase reaction mixtures (290 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 22 °C), 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the indicated [32P]DNA substrate (0.28 nm 750-bp blunt duplex, 0.4 nm 851-bp partial duplex, or 0.17 nm 92-bp partial duplex). Proteins were diluted in helicase II storage buffer, and protein was premixed (either UvrD and storage buffer or UvrD and MutL) prior to combination with the other reaction components. Reactions were prewarmed at 37 °C prior to initiation with ATP (to 3 mm), and incubation was continued at 37 °C. Following initiation, 20-μl samples were withdrawn at the indicated times and quenched by combining with 10 μl of stop solution (37.5% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.5% each xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue). Reaction products were resolved on 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Results were visualized and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Data obtained for the initial 10 min of the reaction, avoiding points where the concentration of DNA substrate becomes limiting, were fit to Equation 1 from Amaratunga and Lohman (41Amaratunga M. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6815-6820Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), A(t)=Ab(1−e(−kbt))+vsstEquation 1 where A(t) is the total amplitude or femtomoles unwound at time t, Ab is the amplitude of the burst phase, kb is the rate constant for the burst phase, and vss is the steady-state rate of unwinding represented by the second phase of the curve (41Amaratunga M. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6815-6820Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Values of kinetic constants were determined using the nonlinear least-squares technique and SigmaPlot. Error values were generated by SigmaPlot. For the experiment shown in Fig. 6, the helicase reaction mixture was assembled as indicated for standard helicase assays with the 148-bp blunt duplex at a final concentration of 0.15 nm molecules. Reactions were performed at 22 °C. Reactions were incubated for 1 min at 22 °C prior to initiation of the unwinding reaction with ATP (to 3 mm) in a total reaction volume of 120 μl. After 30 s had elapsed, 1 μl of 0.5 mm 48-mer was added to the reaction mixture to trap free UvrD. Samples were withdrawn, quenched, and analyzed as indicated above.Figure 6Processivity test of UvrD and UvrD + MutL on the 148-bp blunt duplex substrate. Processivity test experiments were performed as detailed under “Experimental Procedures” for 3 nm UvrD plus 50 nm MutL in the absence of added ssDNA trap (●) or with the addition of the ssDNA trap after 30 s of unwinding (○). Data represent the average of at least three independent trials. Error bars are means ± S.D. The fraction of unwound substrate molecules was calculated for each time point as described previously (38Hall M.C. Ozsoy A.Z. Matson S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 257-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The equation for a rectangular hyperbola was fit to the data (solid lines) using SigmaPlot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In single-turnover helicase assays, reactions were assembled as described above with a final DNA substrate concentration of 1 nm. Unwinding reactions were incubated at 18 °C. Reactions were preincubated on ice for 10 min and at 18 °C for 4 min prior to initiation of unwinding with a mixture of ATP (to 3 mm) and 48-mer (to 8 μm) for a total reaction volume of 120 μl. Sample removal, quenching, and analysis were as indicated above. MutL has been shown to dramatically stimulate the unwinding reaction catalyzed by UvrD as part of a reconstituted mismatch repair reaction and in a standard helicase assay lacking the other enzymes involved in mismatch repair (27Hall M.H. Escherichia coli DNA Helicase II: Structure-function Analysis of Conserved Amino Acid Motifs and Investigation of Protein-Protein Interactions. Ph.D. thesis.

However, the biochemical mechanism of this stimulation is not known. To further investigate this stimulation, MutL was purified to near homogeneity from a strain lacking the mutS gene (see “Experimental Procedures”) (data not shown). This was done to avoid any complications that might arise from the presence of low level contamination by MutS. It should be noted that experiments performed with MutL purified from a ΔuvrD strain produced results similar to those produced by experiments performed with MutL purified from a ΔmutSstrain (27Hall M.H. Escherichia coli DNA Helicase II: Structure-function Analysis of Conserved Amino Acid Motifs and Investigation of Protein-Protein Interactions. Ph.D. thesis. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill1998Google Scholar) (data not shown). Previous experiments reached contradictory conclusions regarding the ability of MutL to bind DNA (21Ban C. Junop M.

The binding of MutL to ssDNA or to a partial duplex DNA ligand was evaluated using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay (Fig. 1). MutL bound to the 92-bp partial duplex DNA with an apparent KD of 25 nm (Fig. 1 A, ●), but failed to bind ssDNA ([32P]DNA 90-mer) in the absence of nucleotide at concentrations up to 400 nm (Fig. 1 B, ○). The failure of MutL to bind to ssDNA in the absence of nucleotide was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown). However, limited binding of MutL to ssDNA was observed in the presence of ATP (data not sho"

Kifunensine inhibition of ER mannosidase I also suppressed ERAD in castanospermine-treated cells; thus, suppression of ERAD does not require lectin-like binding of ER chaperones calnexin and calreticulin to monoglucosylated oligosaccharides. Notably, the undegraded protein fraction remained completely microsome-associated. In pulse-chase studies, kifunensine-sensitive degradation was still inhibitable even 1 h after Tg synthesis. Intriguingly, chronic treatment with kifunensine caused a 3-fold accumulation of Cog Tg in Chinese hamster ovary cells and did not lead to significant induction of the ER unfolded protein response. We hypothesize that, in a manner not requiring lectin-like activity of calnexin/calreticulin, the recognition or processing of a specific branched N-linked mannose structure enhances the efficiency of glycoprotein retrotranslocation from the ER lumen.

For many secretory proteins, the misfolded versions may enter the ER lumen completely before a final cellular disposition is made (9Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Mao J. Wittrup K.D. J. Biol.

Thus, it is not surprising that molecular chaperones acting in the ER lumen have been implicated as participants in the retention and ERAD processes. Of the ER chaperones proposed to function in targeting for retrotranslocation and ERAD, calnexin has been the most often implicated (12Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Other studies, however, have suggested that ERAD is independent of calnexin or that association with calnexin actually prevents ERAD (18Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A.

In normal mammalian cells, this association is prevented by pretreatment with castanospermine (CAS), an inhibitor of glucosidases I and II (21Keller S.H. Lindstrom J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17064-17072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Hammond C. Helenius A.

By contrast, the calnexin interaction is enhanced in cells pretreated with 1-deoxymannojirimycin (DMM), the general α-mannosidase inhibitor that prevents the formation of Man5–7 glycans, which are less efficient substrates for monoglucosylation (29Sousa M.C. Ferrero-Garcia M.A. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 30Van Leeuwen J.E. Kearse K.P. J. Biol.

Lehrman M. Williams D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Using these inhibitors as well as other approaches, several groups have begun to explore the role of early carbohydrate trimming reactions in the targeting of ER-retained glycoproteins for the ERAD process.In particular, reports indicate that for yeast prepro-α-factor expressed in mammalian cells (32Su K. Stoller T. Rocco J. Zemsky J. Green R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14301-14309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the Hong Kong null form of α1-antitrypsin (33Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), or the δ-subunit of the T-cell antigen receptor (34Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), treatment of cells with DMM results in marked inhibition of the ERAD process. In detailed studies of the Hong Kong null form of α1-antitrypsin, when ERAD was inhibited by cycloheximide treatment, calnexin dissociation and post-translational oligosaccharide trimming were blocked; by contrast, when ERAD was inhibited by DMM, the fraction of antitrypsin dissociated from calnexin appeared normal, whereas mannose trimming was nevertheless blocked (33Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). One simple interpretation of these data might be that ERAD proceeds by a pathway (blocked at different points by different inhibitors) that may involve calnexin dissociation, followed by additional steps that include trimming to Man8. In such a case, the ultimate targeting for retrotranslocation might be expected to involve ER residents other than calnexin. However, in subsequent provocative experiments using a C-terminally truncated mutant form of α1-antitrypsin, it was argued that a monoglucosylated Man8 calnexin-bound form is the immediate precursor for ERAD (35Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Indeed, pretreatment of cells with CAS to prevent the lectin-like calnexin association was reported to result in an ERAD process for mutant antitrypsin that cannot be inhibited by DMM (33Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (nor even the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (35Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar)). This has led to a hypothesis that rebinding to calnexin might be an essential step for targeting misfolded N-linked glycoproteins for proteasomal proteolysis.To test this hypothesis, we have now examined cell culture expression of the cog thyroglobulin (Tg) mutant (a L2263P substitution in Tg that causes congenital goiter in homozygous mice) and γ-carboxylation-deficient protein C, two misfolded glycoproteins that serve as models of genetic and acquired ER storage diseases, respectively (36Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.-N. Lee I. Yoo S.-E. Arvan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9909-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 37Tokunaga F. Wakabayashi S. Koide T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As with mutant antitrypsin (38Marcus N.Y. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1987-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), ERAD of both proteins is significantly impaired upon specific inhibition of ER mannosidase I. However, in cells pretreated with CAS so that lectin-like binding of calnexin is blocked, the ERAD process is still proteasomal; moreover, it is still largely blocked upon inhibition of ER mannosidase I. Although the data do not exclude enhanced calnexin binding under specified experimental circumstances, they signify a more general role for recognition and trimming of specific N-linked mannose residues in the ERAD process for at least a subset of glycoproteins.DISCUSSIONEarly carbohydrate trimming reactions have become a subject of increasing interest not only with respect to the folding of normal exportable glycoproteins and their exit from the ER (51Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), but also in the targeting of misfolded glycoproteins for ERAD. At the time of initial reports that ER mannosidase activity might function at an early step in the degradation of retained versions of exportable glycoproteins (32Su K. Stoller T. Rocco J. Zemsky J. Green R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14301-14309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a conceptual framework accounting for ERAD had not yet emerged. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae brought forward the suggestion that calnexin might facilitate retrotranslocation to the cytosol (14McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that this observation was made for unglycosylated pro-α-factor, for which it is unclear how the lectin-only model of calnexin activity (25Rodan A.R. Simons J.F. Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6921-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Zapun A. Petrescu S.M. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) would apply. At the same time, cells devoid of Mns1p (ER mannosidase I) were found to exhibit abnormally diminished degradation of a mutant form of carboxypeptidase Y (52Knop M. Hauser N. Wolf D.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); these results have recently been confirmed and extended to show that such degradation does not require the formation of glucosylated oligosaccharides (53Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings in S. cerevisiae indicate suppressive effects of ERAD as a consequence of decreased ER mannosidase I activity without an evident requirement for the lectin-like activity of calnexin.Since the role of calnexin in S. cerevisiae may be unique to that organism (54Parodi A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), it is of interest to know how the foregoing reports compare with the situation for glycoprotein ERAD in higher eukaryotes. Specifically, although several groups have now found that inhibition of ER mannosidase activity can also suppress ERAD in mammalian cells (24de Virgilio, M., Kitzmuller, C., Schwaiger, E., Klein, M., Kreibich, G., and Ivessa, N. E. (1999) Mol. Biol. Cell4059–4073.Google Scholar, 32Su K. Stoller T. Rocco J. Zemsky J. Green R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14301-14309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Liu Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1987-1992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), study of a C-terminally truncated α1-antitrypsin expressed in mouse hepatoma cells led to the recent suggestion that ER mannosidase I specifically targets misfolded glycoproteins for disposal using a lectin-mediated process dependent upon binding monoglucosylated Man8oligosaccharides to calnexin (35Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to confirm a role for early carbohydrate processing and calnexin binding in the ERAD process for Cog Tg and γ-carboxylation-deficient protein C, which cause inherited and acquired ER storage diseases, respectively (36Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.-N. Lee I. Yoo S.-E. Arvan P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9909-9913Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 37Tokunaga F. Wakabayashi S. Koide T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).After synthesis, both misfolded glycoproteins were extensively degraded (Figs. 1 and 12) via a proteasomal mechanism. Confirming the work of Sifers and co-workers (35Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), we found that KIF, an inhibitor of ER mannosidase I (41Weng S. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25656-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), selectively suppressed ERAD of both misfolded glycoproteins (Figs. 3 and 9). More specifically, the data suggested that Cog Tg protected from ERAD failed to undergo trimming from Man9 to Man8 (Fig. 4). KIF treatment did not impair the anterograde traffic of native Tg or protein C from the ER (Fig. 5) (data not shown), nor did it affect the degradation of misfolded Tg or protein C that was unglycosylated after tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 10). However, KIF did appear to impair retrotranslocation of the misfolded glycoproteins to the cytosol, based upon microsomal sedimentation data (Fig. 6) and our unpublished observations that native and misfolded forms showed no difference in trypsin sensitivity in microsomal protease protection assays. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a limited degree of retrotranslocation to the cytosol in the presence of lactacystin that is below the detection limits of our assays (23White A.L. Guerra B. Wang J. Lanford R.E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although we could find no evidence for accumulation of insoluble Tg aggregates (Fig. 7) in cytosolic aggresomes (44Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Suppressed Tg degradation was also observed in dithiothreitol-treated cells (Fig. 8); together, these data suggest that the effects of mannosidase I are not limited to specific protein domains, but seem to represent a more general feature in the ERAD process for at least a subset of glycoproteins.Unlike for α1-antitrypsin, suppression of ERAD with inhibitors of ER mannosidase I occurred efficiently even in cells continuously treated with CAS (Figs. 3 and 9). Under these conditions, the lectin-like binding of calnexin to monoglucosylated oligosaccharides cannot be initiated (18Kearse K.P. Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 27Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 28Vassilakos A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3944-3948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); moreover, these conditions also interfere with glycoprotein association of calreticulin (56Wada I. Imai S. Kai M. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20298-20304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) as well as ER60/ERp57 (57Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Thus, although data implicating lectin-like calnexin association have been presented in some cases (13Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 35Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol.

Williams D.B. Singer A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3678-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Romagnoli P. Germain R.N. J. Exp.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) is that a lectin-mediated association of the calnexin/calreticulin-ERp57 complex is not a general requirement for retrotranslocation of misfolded glycoproteins to the ERAD machinery. However, since ER chaperones are likely to be associated in a network (59Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and since different ERAD substrates exhibit different patterns of chaperone binding (42Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), it is most probable that multiple ER chaperones have the potential to participate in the targeting of different misfolded protein substrates for retrotranslocation and ERAD.Current reports suggest plasticity in the mechanisms leading to ER targeting for proteolysis. For example, ERAD occurs also for unglycosylated (misfolded) exportable proteins (Fig. 10) (14McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Additionally, there is one N-linked glycoprotein (the T-cell receptor α-subunit) for which inhibition of mannosidase activity doesnot significantly suppress the ERAD process (34Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Importantly, complete deglycosylation has been reported as an intermediate stage in ERAD for several misfolded glycoprotein substrates (43Wiertz E.J.H.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 60Hughes E.A. Hammond C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Houghton M. Walker C.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 669-676PubMed Google Scholar) based on peptide N-glycosidase activity that may be localized to the cytosol (64Romisch K. Ali B.R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6730-6734Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or to the ER (65Weng S. Spiro R.G. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 66Suzuki T. Yan Q. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10083-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it is reasonable to propose plasticity in the ERAD pathway involving the existence of distinct, and perhaps parallel, initial targeting. In this case, a Man8-GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide structure specific to the “B-isoform” configuration (i.e. such that after mannosidase cleavage, a terminal mannose remains in the α1,3-linkage (41Weng S. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25656-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) may directly or indirectly facilitate protein disposition via one of these routes, and when this is blocked, undegraded intermediates presumably accumulate until alternative degradative routes prevail. The existence of such alternative routes presumably accounts for the fact that eventual degradation of Cog Tg and γ-carboxylation-deficient protein C is observed even in the presence of KIF. Thus, two alternative hypotheses that need to be tested are as follows. 1) Although not absolutely required, mannose reCognition and trimming may be an important priming step in the pathway of deglycosylation preceding ERAD; alternatively, 2) the B-isoform of Man8-GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides might facilitate the presentation of misfolded glycoproteins (53Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) for multi-ubiquitination (6Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 22Schubert U. Anton L.C. Bacik I. Cox J.H. Bour S. Bennink J.R. Orlowski M. Strebel K. Yewdell J.W. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Either or both of these activities might be associated (physically or kinetically) with retrotranslocation through the Sec61 translocon (58de Virgilio M. Weninger H. Ivessa N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9734-9743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).With these thoughts in mind, we note that oligosaccharide trimming by ER mannosidase I appears to be a relatively slow step in the processing of Cog Tg and γ-carboxylation-deficient protein C (Figs. 11 and 13). We therefore expected that Cog Tg might massively accumulate in the ER in the setting of chronic KIF treatment, which could trigger the unfolded protein response (68Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). However, after 3 days of KIF treatment, Cog Tg accumulated only moderately, and no clear increase in BiP, GRP94, ERp72, calreticulin, or ER60 was observed (Fig. 14 A). Potentially, alternative routes directing Cog Tg to proteasomal degradation could be induced under these conditions (which may be consistent with the results of Fig. 14 (B andC)). We do not yet know if cells may exhibit a compensatory response to chronic mannosidase I blockade, such as further induction of ER mannosidase I, endomannosidase (69Weng S. Spiro R.G. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 70Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Soling H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), or other activities. We are currently pursuing these possibilities. Whether genetic or acquired, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 storage diseases begin with the synthesis of misfolded versions of exportable proteins within the ER compartment (1Kim P.S. Arvan P. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 173-202PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, these proteins are retained in the ER (2Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) pending targeting for ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (3Brodsky J.L. McCraken A.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), at which point they are retrotranslocated to the cytosol (4Wiertz E.J.H.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu, J.

For many secretory proteins, the misfolded versions may enter the ER lumen completely before a final cellular disposition is made (9Kowalski J.M. Parekh R.N. Mao J. Wittrup K.D. J. Biol.

How was the replication complex bound to the membrane, and how was it targeted specifically to the endo/lysosomal membranes? To answer these questions, we have expressed the virus-specific RNA replicase components, i.e.the nonstructural proteins Nsp1–4 of Semliki Forest virus (SFV)1 in different cells (7Peränen J.

Of these proteins only Nsp1 (537 amino acids) was found to attach to the plasma membrane and to some extent also to endosomal/lysosomal membranes (8Laakkonen P. Auvinen P. Kujala P. Kääriäinen L.

The strength of membrane association of Nsp1 was as strong as that of integral membrane proteins due to post-translational palmitoylation of the cysteine residues 418–420. Mutation of these cysteines to alanines resulted in peripheral-type membrane association (10Laakkonen P. Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. J. Biol.

Surprisingly, infection of cells with SFV coding for non-acylated Nsp1 resulted in a normal virus production appearance of typical cytoplasmic vacuole structures (11Ahola T. Kujala P. Tuittila M.

Flotation tests in discontinuous sucrose gradients indicated that the synthesized protein was associated with the plasma membrane of E. coli. When the membrane was solubilized with detergents, Nsp1 lost its methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities (13Laakkonen P. Hyvönen M. Peränen J. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7418-7425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 15Ahola T. Laakkonen P. Vihinen H. Kääriäinen L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 392-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both activities were restored upon the addition of either liposomes or detergent micelles containing phosphatidylserine or other anionic phospholipids. To map the membrane binding domain within Nsp1, we used deletion and point mutagenesis and in vitro translation in the presence of phosphatidylserine-containing liposomes. By these means, a specific lipid binding region in the middle of Nsp1 was identified. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 245–264 was able to compete for the binding of in vitro translated Nsp1 to liposomes (12Ahola T. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. EMBO J. 1999; 11: 3164-3172Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here we have studied the mechanism of membrane association of the putative membrane binding peptide of Nsp1 and its mutant derivatives using fluorescence and circular dichroism spectrometry. The three-dimensional structure of the peptide was determined by NMR spectroscopy. The results suggest that the membrane association of the peptide and, thus, that of Nsp1 is mediated by polar interactions between positively charged amino acid residues and the negatively charged head groups of the anionic phospholipids. Also, hydrophobic interactions, particularly those between the single tryptophan residue and the lipid acyl chains, were critical. We expect that other positive-strand RNA viruses have similar mechanisms for membrane binding of their replication complexes (see 12). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylserine (POPS), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidic acid as well as the brominated phosphatidylcholines were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 1-Palmitoyl-2-(1-pyren)decanoylphosphatidylserine (PyrPS) and 1-palmitoyl-2-(1-pyren)decanoylphosphatidylcholine (PyrPC) were synthesized as described (16Somerharju P.J. Virtanen J.A. Eklund K.K. Vainio P. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2773-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Vauhkonen M. Sassaroli M. Somerharju P. Eisinger J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All lipids were at least 98% pure, as checked by TLC and high performance liquid chromatography. Fluorescamine was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The peptides were synthesized at the Division of Biochemistry, Department of Biosciences and at the Haartman Institute Peptide and Protein Laboratory of the University of Helsinki using the Applied Biosystems model 433A peptide synthesizer and 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chemistry. The peptides were purified on a octadecylsilica reverse-phase column, and their purity and mass were checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The lipids dissolved in chloroform/methanol (9:1) stocks were mixed in small glass tubes and dried under nitrogen flow. Any residual solvent was removed by keeping the residue in a vacuum desiccator for 1 h. The lipids were hydrated by adding 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and sonicated on ice with a Branson sonicator (50 W output) equipped with a microtip until the solution clarified (∼10 min). The resulting small vesicles were stored at 4 °C and used the following day. Multilamellar liposomes for the flotation assays were prepared by vortexing the dried lipids into 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl. Combined in vitro transcription-translation was performed with the TnT T7 kit (Promega) using an appropriate circular plasmid containing the Nsp1 gene under the control of the T7 promoter. Nsp1 was translated in vitro in the presence of multilamellar liposomes (1.67 mm lipids), and the translation mixtures were subjected to flotation in discontinuous sucrose gradients (12Ahola T. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. EMBO J. 1999; 11: 3164-3172Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The sucrose solutions were prepared in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. When a synthetic peptide (0.5 mm) was present in the translation mixtures, it was also included in the 67, 60, and 50% sucrose layers at 50 μmconcentration. The gradients were centrifuged overnight at 35,000 rpm in a SW50.1 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C. The vesicles and the associated proteins floated to the top of the 50% sucrose layer, whereas the soluble proteins remained in the 60% layer. Fractions were collected from the top and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The fluorescence spectra were recorded on a PTI QuantaMaster fluorescence spectrophotometer with the emission and excitation slits set to 2 nm. The samples were kept in a 1-cm quartz cuvettes thermostatted to 25 °C, and they contained 5.0 μm peptide and 100 μm lipid in 5 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 2 ml. CD spectra were obtained at 25 °C with a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a 1-mm quartz cell. The scan rate was 50 nm/min, and 10 spectra were averaged. The samples were in a total volume of 200 μl in 5 mm Tris buffer, and the peptide and lipid concentrations were 50 μm and 1 mm, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Samples of freeze-dried peptide were dissolved in D3-trifluoroethanol/H2O (7:3, v/v) to obtain 1 mm solution. The samples were loaded to 220 μl Shigemi micro cells and pH (not corrected for the deuteron or solvent effects) was adjusted to 6.0 by adding dilute HCl. The NMR spectra were acquired with 600 and 800 MHz Varian Unity NMR spectrometers. Homonuclear two-dimensional spectra, correlation spectroscopy (COSY), relayed COSY, total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY, with mixing times of 30, 55, and 180 ms), and nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOESY, with mixing times of 50, 100, 200, and 400 ms) data were collected at 10 °C and processed using the Felix 98 software. Spin systems were assigned from the through-bond correlation spectra, and the sequence-specific assignments were deduced from the NOEs between the adjacent spin systems. Distance restraints were extracted from the homonuclear NOE data by fitting a second-order polynomial to integrated cross-peak volumes of the NOE series. The intra-methylene and helical NHi-NHi+1 NOEs were used for the calibration. Distances were given with +30 and −40% uncertainties. When a distance could not be extracted from the build-up curve, either owing to an overlap, a poor signal-to-noise ratio, or other disturbances, the distance was restrained to be not more than 5.0 Å. The upper bounds were extended by 1.0 Å for each pseudo-atom in methyl groups and 1.5 Å for pseudo-atoms in aromatic rings. Backbone ϕ-dihedral angles characterized by small JHNHα, measured from the correlation (COSY) spectra, were restrained to the helical conformation (±30 degrees) on the basis of the Karplus relation. Dihedral angles characterized by intermediate JHNHα or hydrogen bonds were not constrained. The spectra were assigned, and the distance restraints were generated using the Felix 98 software. Structures were generated by DYANA 1.5 using the torsion angle dynamics approach (18Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). A final set of structures was analyzed for root mean square density, energy, and backbone dihedrals. The coordinates and NMR restraint files of Semliki Forest virus Nsp1 membrane binding peptide will be deposited to the Protein Data Bank (code 1FW5). The peptide corresponding to the previously assigned membrane binding segment (G245STLYTE- SRKLLRSWHLPSV264) of SFV Nsp1 (12Ahola T. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. EMBO J. 1999; 11: 3164-3172Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and three variant peptides with single amino acid replacements (R253E, K254E, and W259A) were synthesized. In addition, a peptide containing the same amino acids as the wild type, but in a random sequence (Fig. 1 B), was prepared. Secondary structure prediction (19Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar, 20Rost B. Sander C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1994; 19: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar) suggested an α-helical conformation for residues Thr-250–Ser-258 of the wild type peptide. At pH 7.5, the net charge of the wild type, the W259A variant, and the random peptide should be +2, and that of R253E and K254E variants should be close to zero. The wild type peptide, variants W259A and R253E, and the random peptide were tested for their ability to compete with Nsp1 for binding to negatively charged multilamellar liposomes. Nsp1 was translatedin vitro in the presence of PS:PC (1:1) liposomes and one of the peptides. The fraction of Nsp1 associating with the vesicles was then determined by subjecting the samples to centrifugation in discontinuous sucrose gradients (12Ahola T. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. EMBO J. 1999; 11: 3164-3172Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The wild type peptide inhibited the association of Nsp1 with liposomes by 64% (Fig.2 C), whereas the random peptide (Fig. 2 B), W259A (Fig. 2 D), or R253E (not shown) variant peptides did not inhibit the binding of Nsp1 to liposomes. As can be seen in Fig. 2, a relatively large amount of wild type peptide was required to successfully compete with the binding of Nsp1 to the liposomes. In these experiments the surface of the liposomes must be covered by the peptide to obtain inhibition, and the liposomes were in excess to the in vitro translation product. To study association of the peptides with membranes of varying charge, we made use of tryptophan fluorescence properties (21Clague M.J. Knutson J.R. Blumenthal R. Herrmann A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5491-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Teale F.W.J. Biochem. J. 1960; 76: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The addition of PC vesicles containing 30 mol % of a negatively charged phospholipid, i.e.phosphatidylglycerol, PS, or phosphatidic acid, caused a major blue shift of tryptophan emission and a marked increase in the fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3). In contrast, a minor shift of tryptophan emission was observed upon the addition of vesicles consisting of zwitterionic phospholipids only. Since a blue shift and an increase in fluorescence intensity are considered to indicate penetration of a tryptophan residue into a lipid bilayer (e.g. Refs. 21Clague M.J. Knutson J.R. Blumenthal R. Herrmann A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5491-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and 23Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4327-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), these data provide strong evidence that the wild type peptide binds avidly to negatively charged membranes but not to uncharged membranes. The variant peptides behaved similarly, except that the effects on the fluorescence parameters were somewhat less pronounced (see below). To study further the effect of the density of negative charge on membranes for peptide association, the PS content of the vesicles was varied from zero to 50 mol % (Fig.4 A). With the wild-type peptide, the blue shift increased until PS content reached 35–40 mol % and then leveled off. With the variants, a threshold concentration of about 10 mol % of PS was necessary before any significant shift was observed. In addition, the blue shift was markedly smaller than with the wild type at all PS concentrations (Fig. 4 A). The effect of PS content on the intensity of tryptophan fluorescence is shown in Fig. 4 B. In case of the wild-type peptide, the intensity increased linearly with PS content until 20–30 mol % and then declined. With the variants, a minimum of ∼10 mol % of PS was again required to obtain a significant effect, and the maximal effect was much smaller than with the wild type (Fig. 4 B). As with the wild type peptide, the intensity decreased above 30 mol % of PS. The reason for this is not clear, but obviously it does not indicate that less peptide would be binding to the vesicles, since the blue shift did not level off until 40–50 mol % (Fig. 4 A). This decrease could result from self-quenching tryptophan-tryptophan interactions that become significant when the surface concentration of the peptide increases with increasing PS content. The addition of increasing amounts of NaCl in the peptide-PC/PS-vesicle solution diminished the blue shift and abolished it completely when the concentration of NaCl reached 100 mm (Fig. 4 C). The effect of NaCl concentration was similar with the wild type and the variant peptides. These data support the importance of ionic interactions for the binding of the peptides to negatively charged membranes. The blue shift observed upon interaction of the peptides with the negatively charged vesicles indicates that the tryptophan moiety penetrates into the vesicle bilayer (23Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4327-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To estimate the depth of penetration, we made use of PC species containing a brominated fatty acid in the sn-2 position. Bromine quenches tryptophan fluorescence by a collision mechanism, and therefore, it is possible to obtain information on the depth of tryptophan penetration by using a set of phospholipids with the bromines attached to different acyl carbons (23Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4327-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Markello T. Zlotnick A. Everett J. Tennyson J. Holloway P.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2895-2901Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25Killian J.A. Keller R.C. Struyve M. de Kroon Al. Tommasen J. Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8131-8137Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Berkhout T.A. Rietveld A. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 897: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Tennyson J. Holloway P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14196-14200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bolen E.J. Holloway P.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9638-9643Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we prepared vesicles consisting of POPS (50 mol %) and a PC species (50 mol %) with bromines in carbons 6 and 7 (6,7-dibromo-PC), 9 and 10 (9,10-dibromo-PC), or 11 and 12 (11,12-dibromo-PC) of thesn-2 acyl chain, mixed them with the peptide, and then recorded the tryptophan emission spectrum. As shown in Fig.5 A, the tryptophan fluorescence of the wild-type peptide was quenched most effectively with 9,10-dibromo-PC. Quenching by the 6,7- and 11,12-dibromo-PC species was clearly less efficient. These findings indicate that the tryptophan of the wild-type peptide penetrates to a depth of the bromines attached to carbons 9 and 10 of the PC sn-2 acyl chain. The 9,10-dibromo-PC species was also the most efficient quencher of K254E (Fig. 5 B) and R253E (Fig. 5 C) variants. However, the fluorescence of the variants was quenched less efficiently with each dibromo-PC species than that of the wild type peptide. This finding implies that the tryptophan residue in the variants penetrates to a similar depth as that of the wild type, but the fraction of the peptide bound to the vesicles was smaller than in the case of the wild type peptide. To study the effect of the peptides on the mobility/lateral organization of the vesicle lipids, we included 5 mol % of either pyrene-labeled PS (PyrPS) or PC (PyrPC) in PS/PC (3:7) vesicles and then determined the effect of the peptides on the pyrene excimer to monomer fluorescence intensity ratio (E/M). The E/M ratio is an indicator of the lateral mobility of the pyrene phospholipid (16Somerharju P.J. Virtanen J.A. Eklund K.K. Vainio P. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2773-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Vauhkonen M. Sassaroli M. Somerharju P. Eisinger J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Mixing of the wild type peptide with vesicles containing PyrPS caused a significant (10%) decrease in the E/M ratio (Fig. 6,A and B). This phenomenon was not seen with the variant peptides (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, a slight increase in the E/M ratio was observed when the wild type peptide or the variant peptides were mixed with vesicles containing PyrPC (Fig.6 C). These results suggest that the wild type peptide interacts preferentially with PS molecules, thus selectively retarding their lateral mobility, whereas interaction of the variant peptides with PS-containing vesicles was weaker. It is intriguing that the W259A variant, even if it contains the same positively charged amino acid residues as the wild type, had no effect on the E/M ratio of PyrPS-containing vesicles. CD spectroscopy was used to determine whether the peptides undergo a conformational change upon interaction with the lipid vesicles. In buffer or in the presence of PC vesicles, all peptides gave spectra with a minimum close to 200 nm and an overall shape suggesting a random coil conformation, as shown for the wild type peptide in Fig. 7 A. When PS was included in the vesicles, the spectrum changed remarkably, with new minima appearing at 208 and 220 nm (Fig. 7 A). These changes imply that the peptide adopts predominantly an α-helical conformation in the presence of PS-containing vesicles. A maximal effect was obtained when the concentration of PS reached 20–30 mol % (Fig.7 A). Identical results were obtained when PS was replaced by another acidic phospholipid such as phosphatidic acid or phosphatidylglycerol but not when it was replaced by the zwitterionic phospholipid PE. Similar results were obtained for the variant peptides R253E, K254E, and W259A (data not shown), whereas the CD spectrum of the random peptide was not significantly affected in the presence of 50 mol % of either PS or PC in the vesicles (Fig.7 C). The CD spectroscopy of the peptides was done also in trifluoroethanol, which had to be used for the NMR studies (29Sönnichsen F.D. Van Eyk J.E. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8790-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). A gradual change from a random coil to an α-helical conformation was observed when increasing amounts of trifluoroethanol was added to the wild type peptide in buffer (Fig. 7 B). The maximal effect was obtained already with 30% trifluoroethanol. With the variant peptides, similar results were obtained (data not shown). These results indicate that the conformation of the peptides in 30% trifluoroethanol is very similar to that of the liposome-bound peptides. NMR spectroscopy was used to assess the structure of the wild type peptide. In water, the wild type peptide was predominantly in a random-coil conformation as indicated by the typical crowding of the NH resonances in fast exchange with water (30Wütrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar). This finding agrees with the CD data (see above). We attempted to determine the structure of the wild type peptide in the presence of lipid vesicles, but this was not feasible due to excessive spectral broadening. This broadening, observed also in the presence of SDS micelles, probably resulted from aggregation of the peptide in the presence of the vesicles or with vesicles. Such vesicle-induced peptide aggregation has been observed previously (31Saleh M.T. Ferguson J. Boggs J.M. Gariepy J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9325-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because of these difficulties, we decided to perform the NMR measurements in trifluoroethanol/water (3:7 v/v) solution. According to CD measurements (see above) the peptide adopts a similar,i.e. a largely α-helical conformation in trifluoroethanol/water solutions, as in the presence of negatively charged liposomes. The three-dimensional structure of the wild type peptide in 3/7 (v/v) trifluoroethanol/water is shown in Fig.8. The overall structure is compatible with the CD data, indicating that in the presence of trifluoroethanol the peptide forms a slightly bent α-helical structure. This helix has an obvious amphiphilic character. One face consist of the hydrophobic residues Leu-248, Leu-255, Leu-256, Leu-261, Val-264 and residues Ser-252 and Trp-259 (Fig. 8 B). The other face consists of polar residues mainly, i.e. the positively charged residues Arg-253, Lys-254, Arg-257 and the negatively residue Glu-251. The positively charged residue Arg-253, shown to be important for the interaction with negatively charged membranes (see above), lies close above the hydrophobic cluster consisting of residues Leu-55, Leu-256, and Trp-259. The hydrophobic surface of the peptide is well defined, whereas the hydrophilic surface is less so due to considerable mobility of the amino acid side chains (Fig. 8 C). Recently, we identified a short sequence of the Semliki Forest virus RNA-capping protein Nsp1 that appeared to be responsible for the binding of the protein to the E. coli plasma membrane and to anionic liposomes (Fig. 1 B) (12Ahola T. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. EMBO J. 1999; 11: 3164-3172Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Here, we have studied the mechanism of membrane binding of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the binding sequence of Nsp1. Parallel studies were carried out with variant peptides with single amino acid replacements corresponding to Nsp1 mutant proteins that lacked enzymatic activity and had a reduced membrane affinity (Fig. 1). All the peptides occurred as a random coil in buffer solutions but attained a partly α-helical conformation in the presence of anionic liposomes as well as in 30% trifluoroethanol. This conformational change may reflect the behavior of the wild type Nsp1 protein, which is enzymatically active in the presence of membranes or mixed micelles of detergent and anionic phospholipids but loses activity in the presence of detergents (12Ahola T. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. EMBO J. 1999; 11: 3164-3172Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The structure of the wild type binding peptide, determined by NMR spectroscopy in 30% trifluoroethanol, revealed an amphiphilic α-helix in which hydrophobic residues concentrate on one side and the polar residues residues concentrate on the other (Fig. 8). As similar CD spectra were obtained both in trifluoroethanol and in the presence of liposomes, we suppose that the NMR structure of the binding peptide is similar in both environments, with the possible exception of polar residues as discussed below. The tryptophan fluorescence data provide strong evidence that the wild type peptide binds avidly to vesicles containing negatively charged phospholipids but not to vesicles consisting of zwitterionic phospholipids only. The positively charged amino acid residues of the peptide obviously play an important role in this interaction, since the R253E and K254E variants appeared to interact differently with negatively charged vesicles. Other findings supported the importance of ionic interactions in the association of the peptide with membranes. First, the peptide is released from the vesicles upon the addition of salt (Fig. 4 C). Second, it adopts an α-helical conformation only in the presence of negatively charged but not uncharged vesicles (Fig. 7). Third, the wild type peptide reduces lateral diffusion (excimer formation) of PyrPS but not that of PyrPC (Fig. 6). NMR analysis of the wild type peptide indicated that the side chains of Arg-253 and Lys-254 are not well localized (Fig.8 C), suggesting that they are quite mobile and thus capable of interacting with acidic phospholipids in vivo. We assume that Arg-257 would also interact with anionic phospholipids, since mutation R257E inhibits the enzymatic activities of Nsp1 protein and its binding to liposomes (12Ahola T. Lampio A. Auvinen P. Kääriäinen L. EMBO J. 1999; 11: 3164-3172Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A marked blue shift and enhancement of tryptophan fluorescence of the wild type peptide was observed upon addition of negatively charged vesicles, indicating that the tryptophan moves to a less polar milieu (22Teale F.W.J. Biochem. J. 1960; 76: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 32Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6500-6505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by the efficient quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence by bromines attached to a PC acyl chain. The quenching data indicated that tryptophan 259 of the wild type peptide penetrates approximately to the level of 9–10 carbon atoms of the acyl chains. Placing tryptophan 259 to this level would bring leucines 248, 255, 256, and 261 as well as Val-264 in contact with the acyl chains. Assuming that the helix of wild type peptide lies nearly parallel to the bilayer surface, one can estimate that the maximum distance from the charged side chain groups of Arg-253 to the α-carbon of Leu-256 is about 10 Å and about 12–15 Å to the aromatic carbons of Trp-259. These estimates comply with the tryptophan quenching data (Fig. 5) placing the tryptophan moiety close to the acyl carbons 9 and 10, i.e. 12 and 13.5 Å below the phospholipid polar head groups. This type of membrane association of proteins, i.e. only one leaflet of a lipid bilayer has been designated as monotopic (33Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Alignment of Nsp1 s of the Alphavirus family suggests that a similar amphipathic α-helix is present in each protein (34Rozanov M.N. Koonin E.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2129-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The amino acid residues that form the hydrophobic surface of the Nsp1 wild type peptide are conserved, as is the critical arginine residue 253 (Fig. 1). Thus, all Alphavirus Nsp1 proteins most probably have a similar monotopic membrane binding mechanism. Several other proteins seem to associate with membranes monotopically. One of the best characterized among these is prostaglandin H synthase, which binds to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane via four short amphipathic helices with hydrophobic surfaces interacting with the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer (35Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar, 36Picot D. Garavito M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CTP:phosphocholine cytidyltransferase (EC2.7.7.15) associates with membranes via an amphipathic α-helical peptide (23Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B.

The binding of human coagulation factors V and VIII to phosphatidylserine-rich platelet membranes is mediated by a C2 domain that is homologous in both proteins. The crystal structures of the C2 domains of factors V and VIII determined recently revealed finger-like loop structures that enable hydrophobic interactions within the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer as well as polar interactions with the phosphatidylserine head groups (39Macedo-Ribeiro S. Bode W. Huber R. Quinn-Allen M.A. Kim S.W. Ortel T.L. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Stubbs M.T. Kane W.H. Fuentes-Prior P.

Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The importance of tryptophan 259 for the membrane association of Nsp1 was confirmed by the finding that its replacement by alanine diminished the ability of the peptide to retard lateral diffusion of PyrPS and abolished binding of intact Nsp1 to membranes (12Ahola T.

Variant peptide W259A also failed to compete with binding of wild type Nsp1 protein to liposomes (Fig. 2 D). It is becoming increasingly apparent that tryptophan plays an important role in membrane association of many cellular proteins, such as phospholipases (41Baker S.F. Othman R. Wilton D.C.

Notably, replacement of valine by tryptophan (V3W) in human phospholipase PLA2 resulted in 250-fold enhancement of the activity due to enhanced membrane association (41Baker S.F. Othman R.

Two of the amphipathic helices of prostaglandin H synthases have tryptophans in the hydrophobic surface (36Picot D. Garavito M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic loops of factors V and VIII described above also have tryptophans. Tryptophan appears to possess several characteristics (including aromaticity) that make its disposition at the membrane interphase particularly favorable (for a detailed discussion, see Ref. 45White S.H. Wimley W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have shown that the binding peptide of Nsp1 attains an α-helical conformation in the presence of anionic liposomes. Its structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol reveals an amphipathic α-helix with a protruding tryptophan residue and a hydrophobic surface, which interact with acyl chains in the liposomes. Tryptophan 259 is necessary for proper binding of the peptide to lipids. Residues Arg-253, Lys-254, and probably also Arg-257 are needed for the interaction with head groups of anionic phospholipids, indicating that lipid binding of the peptide and most probably also of the entire Nsp1 protein is a finely tuned process perhaps initiated by polar interactions that lead to conformational change, allowing hydrophobic interactions to take place (cf.

Our intention is to introduce the present mutations of the binding peptide to the infectious clone of SFV to analyze the localization of the replication complex, putative infectivity, and pathogenicity of the transcribed RNAs.

Utilizing differential display, we searched for molecular components involved in song system regulation. We identified a cDNA (zRalDH) that encodes a class 1 aldehyde dehydrogenase. zRalDH was highly expressed in various song nuclei and synthesized retinoic acid efficiently. Brain areas expressing zRalDH generated retinoic acid. Within song nucleus HVC, only projection neurons not undergoing adult neurogenesis expressed zRalDH. Blocking zRalDH activity in the HVC of juveniles interfered with normal song development.

Another well known component of the mammalian UV response is the transcription factor c-Jun (Angel, P., and Karin, M. (1991) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1072, 129–157). We show here that upon UV irradiation p53 activates transcription of the human mismatch repair geneMSH2. Interestingly, this up-regulation critically depends on functional interaction with c-Jun. Hence, the synergistic interaction of a proto-oncogene with a tumor suppresser gene is required for the regulation of the mammalian stress response through activation of expression of MSH2.

Li G.M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar,2Fishel R. Lescoe M.K. Rao M.R. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Garber J. Kane M. Kolodner R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar). It is, so far, the most frequently impaired gene in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)1 (3Fishel R. Nat. Med. 1999; 11: 1239-1240Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Kolodner R.D.

Patients from families that suffer from HNPCC are characterized by an early onset cancer, especially of the colorectum and endometrium. The mechanism of MSH2-induced cancer is via defects in DNA mismatch repair. Mutations in the coding region of the human gene have been shown to be involved directly in microsatellite instability in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal tumors, and these tumor cells are typically defective in DNA mismatch correction (1Drummond J.T. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 6Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A.

Perucho M. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14367-14370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, there is a direct link between HNPCC genes and the genetic instability caused by this DNA repair enzyme. Another contributing factor in HNPCC carcinogenesis is that a second mismatch repair allele has often undergone somatic inactivation or mutation. Thus, these defective cells have no possibility to detect or repair mismatches (8Kolodner R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 397-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The MSH2 gene is part of the post-replicative mismatch repair system that prevents the accumulation of spontaneous mutations and, thereby, ensures the integrity and stability of the genome. The function of the mismatch repair system is to recognize DNA mismatches and to repair the DNA via excision and replacement with the correct nucleotide. Two different heterodimers are responsible for detection of mismatches. The first, the MutSα complex, is composed of MSH2 and MSH6. The second, MutSβ, is an MSH2/MSH3 heterodimer. MutSα recognizes mismatches and loops of 1–2 bp, whereas MutSβ is responsible for the elimination of mispairs and loops of 2–4 bp. After recognition and binding of one of these complex to the mispaired region, a series of binding partners accumulate and repair reactions proceed (1Drummond J.T. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 9Bronner C.E. Baker S.M. Morrison P.T. Warren G. Smith L.G. Lescoe M.K. Kane M. Earabino C. Lipford J. Lindblom A. Nature. 1994; 368: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Thus, MSH2 plays a central role in DNA repair and represents a critical “caretaker” (10) in protection from deleterious mutation accumulation. Another component of the cancer prevention machinery for the body is the p53 tumor suppresser. After DNA damage, p53 expression is up-regulated (11Lee J. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5742-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 12Levine A.J. Momand J. Finlay C.A.

Activation of p53 seems to be necessary for DNA repair of UV-irradiated cells (17,19–32). However, at present no direct connection between p53 and expression of a DNA mismatch repair gene in response to DNA damage has been established. Carcinogens, such as UV irradiation, regulate gene expression through the c-Jun/AP-1 transcription factor (33Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 85-104PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of mouse fibroblasts isolated from c-fos- and c-jun-deficient embryos have already established a critical role of these proteins in the cellular response to genotoxic agents (34Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 35Kolbus A. Herr I. Schreiber M. Debatin K.M. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 20: 575-582Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Moreover, a direct role of c-Jun in the transcriptional control of p53 expression has been documented (36Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mökhle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the p53-regulated GADD45 family of proteins induce p38/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation. This pointed to a cooperation of p53 and the c-Jun pathway (37Takewa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Here we describe a novel type of synergism between p53 and c-Jun. We show that the transcription factors cooperate in the up-regulation of the DNA repair gene hMSH2 in response to UV irradiation. SAOS-2 cells were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, ACC 243) and were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The HaCaT cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Prior to irradiation, culture medium was replaced with phosphate-buffered saline. Fresh medium was added after irradiation. Depending on the cell line, UVB doses of 50, 75, or 100 J/m2 were used. Cell extracts were prepared at different time intervals after UVB irradiation as indicated. The β-galactosidase control vector, the pGl3 basic vector, and the pGl3 control vector were from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). 887 bp of the hMSH2promoter were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers 5′-aagtggcgtgaacatagctga-3′ and 5′-tcagctgcaaggcttgaagcc-3′. To the 5′-end of the first primer a KpnI site was added, and to the second primer a HindIII site was added. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified and finally subcloned into the pGl3-luciferase vector. To prepare the p53 and c-Jun mutanthMSH2 promoter, we used the Quick Change Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The p53-binding site 5′-aggctagttt-3′ was changed to 5′-aggagcgttt-3′ in the mutant version of thehMSH2 expression vector, and the AP-1 site 5′-tgaatca-3′ was changed to 5′-ggaagca-3′ in the mutant version of the hMSH2vector. Expression vectors for p53 and c-Jun have been described previously (38Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). All plasmids were Qia-tip-purified (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and dissolved in Tris/EDTA buffer. The transfection reaction was done with “Dospers” liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the supplier's recommendations. One or two days before transfection the cells were seeded on 6-well plates to reach 60–80% confluency on the day of transfection. Each transfection experiment was done with 1 μg of the β-galactosidase construct as internal standard and 2 μg of each different hMSH2 construct together with various amounts of p53 or c-jun expression vectors. Values are the mean of at least three independent experiments. The preparation of cell extracts and determination of luciferase activity in a LUMAT LB 9501 (Berthold, Munich, Germany) was performed according to the supplemented recommendation. The activity of β-galactosidase was detected with the chemiluminescent reporter assay Galacto-Light Plus (Tropix, Bedford, MA) according to the supplier's recommendations. The measured luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase expression. Previously, we have identified a p53-binding motif (−447 5′-aggctagttt-3′ and −416 5′-aagtttccttt-3′; Fig.1 a) in the proximal promoter region of the hMSH2 gene (39Scherer S.J. Seib T. Seitz G. Dooley S. Welter C. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Both sequences are high affinity p53-binding sites in vitro (40Scherer S.J. Welter C. Zang K.D. Dooley S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine the consequences of p53 binding on transcriptional activation ofhMSH2, transient cotransfection experiments were performed using luciferase reporter genes whose expression is driven by the wild-type hMSH2 promoter or by a mutated version in which the p53-binding sites were inactivated by point mutations (Fig.1 a). First, we used HaCaT human keratinocytes expressing endogenous wild-type p53 which is able to bind to its corresponding DNA sequence (41Lehmann T.A. Modali R. Boukamp P. Stanek J. Bennett W.P. Welsh J.A. Metcalf R.A. Stampfer M.R. Fusenig N. Rogan E.M. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 833-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and to activate transcription (42Henseleit U. Zhang J. Wanner R. Haase I. Kolde G. Rosenbach T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 722-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In non-treated cells, low basal level expression of the wild-type hMSH2 reporter was measured. This expression could not be increased upon cotransfection of an expression vector encoding wild-type p53(data not shown) suggesting the endogenous p53 is at saturation for reporter activation. Following UV irradiation, a considerable activation of the hMSH2 promoter was seen (Fig.1 b). Maximal levels were reached within 6 h of irradiation. Importantly, UV-induced activation was lost upon mutation of the p53-binding site (data not shown), demonstrating the functional role of p53 for positive regulation of the hMSH2 promoter by UV. To confirm this assumption in an independent, more rigorous system, we employed human osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells, which lack the endogenousp53 gene (43Chen P.L. Chen Y. Science. 1990; 250: 1576-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with wild-type or mutant hMSH2 reporters together with increasing amounts of an expression vector encoding the wild-type p53. Addition of up to 200 ng of the p53 expression vector had no effect on the basal expression level of hMSH2 (Fig.2). However, when the transfected cells were irradiated with UVB light, a dose- and time-dependent increase in hMSH2 promoter activity was obtained. The maximum response was seen 12 h after irradiation at a dose of 50 J/m2 (Fig. 2 b). By using 75 J/m2, similar results were obtained except that the maximum response was seen after 24 h (not shown). In line with the data obtained in HaCaT cells, the p53-binding motif mutated version of the hMSH2promoter was not able to confer UV responsiveness (Fig. 2 c). When an irrelevant cytomegalovirus-driven expression vector was used, reporter gene expression was unaffected by UV treatment (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that alterations in reporter gene expression are caused by sequestration of factors that commonly bind to the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer unit driving p53expression and the hMSH2 promoter. These data indicated that hMSH2 is a new target of p53-regulated gene expression. The lack of UV irradiation-independent hMSH2 expression by p53 might be explained by the requirement of a UV-induced post-translational modification of p53 and/or by the need for additional UV responsive factors. Interestingly, two “classic” AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos)-binding sites (44Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3262) Google Scholar) are present in the hMSH2 promoter flanking the p53-binding motifs (Fig. 1 a). This opened the possibility that c-Jun interacts with p53 to regulate hMSH2 promoter activity. To clarify this point, the AP-1-binding site located 5′ of the p53-binding motif was mutated (Fig. 1 a). In the presence of cotransfected p53 expression vector, no increase inhMSH2 promoter activity was observed even after appropriate UV irradiation (Fig. 3 a). Thus, the requirement of AP-1 in hMSH2 regulation is indicated. To establish the critical role of c-Jun in hMSH2 regulation by an independent assay, we measured UV-dependenthMSH2 activity in the presence of a dominant-negative version of c-Jun lacking the transactivation domain. This mutant (TAM67) is fully capable of competing with endogenous c-Jun for dimer formation with other Jun, Fos, and ATF proteins resulting in transcriptionally inactive complexes (45Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In SAOS-2 cells in the presence of TAM67, p53-dependent UV induction of the wild-type hMSH2 promoter was completely abolished (Fig.3 b). In the p53-positive HaCaT cells, expression ofTAM67 was sufficient to suppress UV induction of thehMSH2 promoter (Fig. 3 c). These data demonstrate that functional c-Jun containing AP-1 complexes, which bind to thehMSH2 promoter, are necessary for UV- dependent regulation of this gene. By having established a critical role of c-Jun in the regulation of hMSH2 transcription, we wanted to know whether strongly enhanced c-Jun/AP-1 levels were sufficient for induction of the hMSH2promoter in the absence of p53. Therefore, we cotransfected thehMSH2 promoter reporter gene into SAOS-2 cells with a c-jun expression vector in the absence of a p53expression vector. Under these conditions, no UV induction was seen (data not shown). However, when both p53 and c-jun were present, hMSH2 induction levels were comparable to those after UV irradiation in the absence of exogenous c-jun (Fig. 4; compare with Fig. 3, a and b, and Fig. 2 b). In contrast, the promoter containing mutations in the AP-1 site is not responsive to c-jun and p53 overexpression. This shows that enhanced levels of c-jun can substitute for the UV signal and that UV-dependent p53 up-regulation of thehMSH2 promoter is mediated, most likely, exclusively through c-Jun. However, it is important to note that overexpression of c-jun alone is not sufficient for activation of the wild-type promoter because c-Jun-specific transactivation strictly depends on cotransfection of the p53 expression vector (Fig.4). These data further underline the requirement for functional synergism between AP-1 and p53 in transcriptional regulation of a DNA repair enzyme in response to UV irradiation. Our study demonstrated that activation of p53 by a DNA-damaging stimulus is necessary but not sufficient for transcriptional activation of the human mismatch repair gene MSH2. Rather, induction critically depends on a functional synergism between p53 and the ubiquitous transcription factor c-Jun. A connection between c-Jun and p53 in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression has been defined recently. In the absence of c-Jun, the basal level of p53 is increased resulting in reduced cell proliferation. Vice versa, overexpression of c-jun down-regulated p53 promoter activity, suggesting that c-Jun exhibits its function in cell cycle regulation by repression of p53 (36Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mökhle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). At first glance, this type of negative interference appears not to be compatible with the functional synergism between both proteins on hMSH2 regulation. However, it is reasonable to assume that negative interference between c-Jun and p53 may represent a safety device to counteract the harmful consequences of long term overexpression of p53 and c-jun, such as induction of a permanent cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or cell transformation (46Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 379: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). UV-induced expression ofhMSH2, and possibly other factors, will only be favored under conditions where both proteins are present in an appropriate ratio. This interpretation is in line with our findings that UV-dependent induction of the hMSH2 promoter was most efficient using 10 ng of p53 expression vector but was less pronounced with higher amounts of expression vector (Fig.2 b). Similar results were observed with the expression vector encoding c-Jun (data not shown). The mechanism how hMSH2 acting as a mismatch repair gene is involved in the response mechanism to UV damage is not completely clear. It was shown that the human MutSα mismatch repair protein, a heterodimer composed of hMSH2 and hMSH6, binds specially to mismatched bases opposite to UV light photoproducts (47Wang H. Lawrence C.W. Li G.M. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16894-16900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 48Mu D. Tursun M. Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the mismatch repair system is an initial step of the damage signaling and repair cascade (49Duckett D.R. Bronstein S. Taya M.Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The finding that p53 and c-Jun up-regulate the promoter ofhMSH2 provides a novel mechanism that functionally links a tumor suppresser and cell cycle regulator directly to DNA damage repair. To our knowledge, no DNA repair enzyme has been identified by functional means whose expression is regulated by c-Jun. Therefore,hMSH2 represents not only a new p53 but also a novelAP-1 target gene thus making the first link between one of the main genotoxic response transcription factors and DNA repair. On the other hand, our results on the role of p53 in hMSH2regulation are in line with a recent report describing p53 as a transcription activator of a ribonucleotide reductase subunit. This enzyme catalyzes the rate-limiting step for the production of dNTPs, which are not only required for replication but also for DNA repair. The p53-regulated subunit was shown to be critically involved in this process (18Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that p53, possibly assisted by c-Jun/AP-1, orchestrates an even broader set of DNA repair functions. In the future, it will be interesting to analyze other DNA repair genes for p53 and/or c-Jun dependence. We thank Dr. Troy Zars, University of Wuerzburg, for critically reading this manuscript.

This remains controversial for fibroblast and endothelial cell adhesion to fibronectin and is less understood for other matrix proteins and cells. We investigated Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell ERK activation by collagen I and IV, laminin, and fibronectin. Collagens or laminin, but not fibronectin, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin, and p130 cas and activated ERK1/2. Shc, tyrosine-phosphorylated by matrix adhesion in many cells, was not phosphorylated in Caco-2 cells in response to any matrix. Caveolin expression did not affect Caco-2 Shc phosphorylation in response to fibronectin. FAK, ERK, and p130 cas tyrosine phosphorylation were activated after 10-min adhesion to collagen IV. FAK activity increased for 45 min after collagen IV adhesion and persisted for 2 h, while p130 cas phosphorylation increased only slightly after 10 min. ERK activity peaked at 10 min, declined after 30 min, and returned to base line after 1 h. Transfection with FAK-related nonkinase, but not substrate domain deleted p130 cas , strongly inhibited ERK2 activation in response to collagen IV, indicating Caco-2 ERK activation is at least partly regulated by FAK.

Integrins, the principal cellular receptors for the extracellular matrix, have been theorized to initiate this activation by at least two different pathways. In one proposed mechanism, α5β1 integrin activation activates ERK1 and -2 via association of Src with tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and subsequent activation of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase kinase (MEK) pathway (6Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 7Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

In this pathway, extracellular matrix activates ERK via association of these integrins with the integral membrane protein caveolin and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Shc by the tyrosine kinase Fyn in some cell types (8Wary K.K.

Less is known about mechanisms of ERK activation in other cell types or initiated by other matrix proteins such as collagens or laminin. Intestinal epithelial cells in vivo exist on a basement membrane rich in laminin and type IV collagen, while type I collagen and tissue fibronectin are present in the interstitial matrix below the basement membrane. Several investigators, including our own group, have described regulation of intestinal epithelial cell adhesion, spreading, migration, and brush border enzyme activity on these matrix proteins (Refs. 12Basson M.D. Modlin I.M.

While in vivo andin vitro studies suggest that tyrosine kinase signaling initiated by intestinal epithelial cell-matrix interactions is likely to play an essential role in maintenance of the normal differentiated phenotype and in wound healing, the mechanisms of integrin signaling in intestinal epithelial cells have not been studied in as much detail. Thus, an understanding of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways, including ERK activation, initiated by cell-matrix interactions in intestinal epithelial cells is likely to be essential for delineating how the extracellular matrix regulates cellular differentiation in the intestinal mucosa. The purpose of the present work was to characterize the mechanism of ERK activation initiated by matrix proteins present in the extracellular matrix of the intestinal epithelium. For modeling integrin-mediated intestinal epithelial cell-matrix interactions, we chose to study human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. These cells are highly differentiated, possess an integrin complement similar to that of cells in the normal gut mucosa, and have been widely used as a model system (24Peterson M.D. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 445-460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Peterson M.D. Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 461-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chantret I. Barbat A. Dussaulx E. Brattain M.G. Zweibaum A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 1936-1942PubMed Google Scholar). We characterized ERK activation in response to collagen I, collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin adhesion and compared this to tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin, and p130 cas . In addition, since a FAK-independent pathway involving caveolin and the adaptor protein Shc has been proposed for ERK activation in response to fibronectin adhesion, we evaluated the role these proteins might play in Caco-2 cells. We monitored the time course of ERK activation in response to collagen IV adhesion and compared this to FAK activation and the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas and paxillin. Finally, we evaluated the effects of expression of dominant negative forms of p130 cas and FAK on ERK activation in response to collagen IV adhesion.

Passage 45–65 Caco-2 cells were maintained at 37 °C with 8% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4500 mg/liter d-glucose, 4 mmglutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml transferrin, 0.1 mmminimal essential medium nonessential amino acids solution, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3.7 g/liter NaHCO3 and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. 90–95% confluent cells were rinsed with serum-free medium and incubated for 20–24 h with medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then harvested using 0.02% trypsin and 0.27 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 2.8 mm NaH2PO4, 7.2 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mmNaCl). Trypsinized cells were added to an equal volume of 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor in PBS, rinsed twice with serum-free medium, and allowed to recover for 45 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium. Cell suspensions were rotated during recovery. Cells were then allowed to adhere for the indicated time periods to dishes precoated with PLL or with saturating concentrations (29Madri J.A. Pratt B.M. Yannariello-Brown J. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 132: 18-27PubMed Google Scholar) of laminin (25 μg/ml), collagen I (12.5 μg/ml), collagen IV (12.5 μg/ml), or fibronectin (12.5 μg/ml) in precoating buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mmNaHCO3, pH 9.4). Dishes were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prior to cell adhesion. After adhesion, dishes were placed on ice, rinsed three times with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), and then lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g, and supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA® method (Pierce, Rockford IL). For lysates used in ERK2 activity assays, sodium deoxycholate and SDS were omitted and microcystin LR (1 μm; Sigma) was included in the lysis buffer. Protein-matched samples were diluted to equal volumes with immunoprecipitation buffer (modified radioimmunoprecipitation buffer without SDS or sodium deoxycholate), and immunoprecipitations with monoclonal antibodies to FAK, paxillin, or p130 cas or polyclonal antibody to Shc were performed overnight at 4 °C. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG (for monoclonal antibodies) and protein A-Sepharose CL4B were then added, and immunoprecipitations were continued for another 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were rinsed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and then 2× gel-loading buffer (1× gel-loading buffer: 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8) was added, and samples were boiled and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels with 3.5% stacking gels. Gels were transferred to Hybond ECL® nitrocellulose or Immobilon P (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Fifteen to 20 μg protein-matched aliquots were used for Western blots of cell lysates. Blots were detected by the ECL® method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were biotinylated according to the integrin detection protocol of Life Technologies. Briefly, 70–90% confluent Caco-2 cells were trypsinized and added to an equal volume of 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were then rinsed twice with PBS and resuspended in PBS at ∼5 × 106 cells/ml.N-Hydroxysuccinimide-LC biotin (Pierce) was then added at 0.1 mg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were resuspended every 10 min during biotinylation. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS and extracted on ice with modified radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (without SDS or sodium deoxycholate). For immunoprecipitations, 50 μg of cellular protein was used. Biotinylated integrins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce). Dithiothreitol was omitted from the gel-loading buffer to facilitate separation of integrin subunits on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. 70% confluent cells were transfected with a total of 7.5 μg of DNA for each T75 flask. DNA was mixed with 75 μl of Plus reagent in 1 ml of Opti-MEM for 15 min, and then LipofectAMINE (37.5 μl in 1 ml of Opti-MEM) was added. This mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, diluted with 5.5 ml of Opti-MEM, and added to cells for 6 h. Cells were rinsed twice with Opti-MEM prior to the addition of transfection mixture. Following transfection, cells were incubated with normal medium for 20–24 h and then incubated with medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum for an additional 18–24 h prior to adhesion experiments. Immunostaining indicated that 20–25% of cells were transfected using this procedure (30Yu C.F. Sanders M.A. Basson M.D. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 278: G952-G966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For determining the effect of FRNK or ΔSD-p130 cas expression on phosphorylation of FAK or p130 cas , respectively, cells were cotransfected with 6 μg of HA-tagged FRNK or HA-tagged ΔSD-p130 cas DNA and 1.5 μg of HA-tagged FAK or HA-tagged p130 cas DNA. For ERK2 activity assays, cells were cotransfected with 6 μg of HA-tagged FRNK or HA-tagged ΔSD-p130 cas DNA and 1.5 μg of HA-tagged ERK2 DNA. 600 μg of protein aliquots from adhesion assay lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell lysates were then incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose and HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated a second time with protein A-Sepharose and HA monoclonal antibody for 4 h at 4 °C. A similar double immunoprecipitation method was used for cells cotransfected with HA-FAK and HA-FRNK or HA-p130 cas and HA-ΔSD-p130 cas in experiments measuring inhibition of FAK phosphorylation or p130 cas phosphorylation. The two immunoprecipitates were pooled and then rinsed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2). 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 25 μm ATP, 1.0 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were then added, and the kinase reaction was initiated by incubating tubes at 30 °C for 20 min. Tubes were gently agitated during the course of the assay to prevent Sepharose beads from settling. Tubes were placed on ice to stop kinase assays. 10 μl of 2× loading buffer was then added, and samples were boiled and separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were then dried using a Bio-Rad model 583 gel dryer and exposed to film. Where indicated, results were compared using the unpaired Student's t test and considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. In many cell types, adherence to matrix stimulates protein tyrosine phosphorylation (e.g. Refs.31Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 32Takeuchi Y. Suzawa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar phenomenon occurs in intestinal epithelial cells, Caco-2 cells were allowed to adhere to the matrix proteins collagen I, collagen IV, fibronectin, and laminin for 30 min. We observed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the 110–130-kDa range and 70-kDa region in cells adherent to collagen I, collagen IV, or laminin compared with cells adherent to the control substrate PLL. Tyrosine phosphorylation was only slightly increased in cells adherent to fibronectin (Fig. 1). There was also a slight increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins around 48 and 35 kDa in cells adherent to collagen I, collagen IV, and laminin. In another intestinal epithelial cell line, HT-29, we observed a similar pattern of increased tyrosine phosphorylation following adherence to collagen I and laminin (data not shown). HT-29 cells adhered very poorly to fibronectin, preventing this comparison. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (125 kDa), p130 cas , and paxillin (68 kDa) following adhesion to extracellular matrix has been reported in several cell types including NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, rat embryo fibroblasts, and mouse Balb/c3T3 cells (7Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 31Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J.

Since the molecular weights of the first three of these proteins correspond to regions of increased tyrosine phosphorylation in blots of crude cell lysates after adhesion to matrix, we assessed whether tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins is stimulated by matrix adhesion in Caco-2 cells. Lysates of cells adherent to matrix-coated dishes were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to FAK, paxillin, or p130 cas followed by phosphotyrosine blotting (Fig.2 A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of each protein was increased following adhesion to collagen I, collagen IV, or laminin compared with PLL. Densitometric analysis indicated that tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin was increased to the greatest extent following adhesion to collagen I, followed by adhesion to collagen IV and then adhesion to laminin. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas was increased to a similar extent on each of these matrix proteins. Adhesion to fibronectin did not increase tyrosine phosphorylation of any of these proteins compared with PLL adhesion.Figure 2Analysis of tyrosine phosphoproteins in adherent cell lysates. A, lysates of Caco-2 cells in suspension or adherent to various matrix substrates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by phosphotyrosine blotting or directly blotting for activated ERK1 and -2. Abbreviations are as indicated in Fig. 1. Procedures for adhesion, lysis, and immunoprecipitation were as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One of at least three similar experiments is shown. B, cells were allowed to adhere to PLL- or laminin-coated dishes for 30 min. Where indicated, EGF (30 ng/ml) was added to dishes after 20 min of adhesion (10-min EGF stimulation).

We investigated activation of ERK1 and -2 using an antibody that recognizes the activated forms of the kinases. Densitometric analysis indicated that the rank order of ERK stimulation following matrix adhesion was similar to that seen for stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin (Fig. 2 A), with the strongest activation observed following adhesion to collagens I and IV. While a slight increase in ERK activation following fibronectin adhesion was observed in some experiments, densitometric analysis indicated that this increase was not statistically significant compared with PLL adhesion (1.20 ± 0.19 compared with PLL,n = 5, p = 0.36). The adaptor protein Shc is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to fibronectin adhesion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (8Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Although Western blots of Caco-2 cell lysates demonstrated expression of the 46-, 52-, and, to a lesser extent, 66-kDa forms of Shc (not shown), the phosphotyrosine blots in Fig. 1 indicated that matrix adhesion induced only a slight increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the 45–55-kDa region. We therefore sought to further evaluate whether adhesion to matrix results in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation by phosphotyrosine blotting of Shc immunoprecipitates from adherent Caco-2 cell lysates. These experiments also demonstrated that, unlike other signal transduction proteins studied, Shc is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in Caco-2 cells following adhesion to matrix (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, 30 ng/ml EGF treatment of Caco-2 cells adherent to laminin or PLL strongly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 46- and 52-kDa forms of Shc independently of the matrix substrate (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that the Shc in Caco-2 cells is capable of undergoing tyrosine phosphorylation but that such phosphorylation is neither directly triggered nor potentiated by adhesion to matrix.

An additional minor band at 200 kDa, corresponding to the approximate molecular mass of the α6 integrin subunit, was also visible in longer exposures. Immunoprecipitation with α2integrin antibody revealed the same two major bands in similar proportions to β1 integrin antibody immunoprecipitation, suggesting that the major collagen receptor in the Caco-2 cells used in this study may be the α2β1 integrin heterodimer (Fig. 3). α1β1 integrin, which has been linked to ERK2 activation via caveolin and Fyn tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc (8Wary K.K.

In a previous study we showed that Chlamydia trachomatis growth was inhibited by hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, and a mutant resistant to the cytotoxic effects of the drug was isolated. Here we report the cloning, expression, and purification of the R1 and R2 subunits of the C. trachomatis ribonucleotide reductase. In comparison with other ribonucleotide reductases, the primary sequence of protein R1 has an extended amino terminus, and the R2 protein has a phenylalanine where the essential tyrosine is normally located. Despite its unusual primary structure, the recombinant enzyme catalyzes the reduction of CDP to dCDP. Results from deletion mutagenesis experiments indicate that while the extended amino terminus of the R1 protein is not required for enzyme activity, it is needed for allosteric inhibition mediated by dATP. Results with site-directed mutants of protein R2 suggest that the essential tyrosine is situated two amino acids downstream of its normal location. Finally, Western blot analysis show that the hydroxyurea-resistant mutant C. trachomatis isolate overexpresses both subunits of ribonucleotide reductase. At the genetic level, compared with wild type C. trachomatis, the resistant isolate has a single base mutation just upstream of the ATG start codon of the R2 protein. The possibility that this mutation affects translational efficiency is discussed.

Jones R.B. Annu. Rev. Med. 1988; 39: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2Storz J. Barron A.L. Microbiology of Chlamydia. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 167-192Google Scholar). Of the four recognized chlamydial species, two, Chlamydia pneumoniae andChlamydia trachomatis, are established pathogens of humans. Human chlamydial infections are a leading cause of sexually transmitted disease, blindness, and respiratory disease (3Schachter J. Stephens R.S. Chlamydia: Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis, and Immunity. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 139-170Google Scholar). One of the reasons for chlamydiae's success as a pathogen is no doubt linked to its highly specialized biphasic growth cycle (4Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The elementary body (EB)1 is the metabolically inert, osmotically stable extracellular form that is capable of initiating infection by attaching to and entering the host cell. Within a few hours, the internalized EB differentiates into the metabolically active, osmotically fragile reticulate body (RB), which divides by binary fission. About 20 h later, the process of RB differentiation back to EB begins. Over time, chlamydiae have evolved an intimate metabolic relationship with their host. Early studies on chlamydial metabolism indicated that they were auxotrophic for amino acids, nucleotides, and many other components of intermediary metabolism that most free living bacteria are capable of synthesizing themselves (4Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5McClarty G. Stephens R.S. Chlamydia: Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis, and Immunity. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1999: 69-100Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory have shown that chlamydiae are capable of transporting NTPs but not dNTPs directly from the host cell (6McClarty G. Tipples G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4922-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tipples G. McClarty G. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, we isolated a mutant C. trachomatis isolate resistant to the cytotoxic effects of hydroxyurea, a rather specific inhibitor of class I ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) (8Tipples G. McClarty G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4932-4940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these two observations suggested that chlamydiae encode an RNR for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides. Ribonucleotide reductase was the first enzyme shown to contain a protein free radical (9Ehrenberg A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3485-3488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is now known that the free radical is used to activate the ribonucleotide substrate (10Stubbe J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 349-419PubMed Google Scholar). Currently there are three classes of RNRs, which are differentiated on the basis of the mechanism they use for radical generation and the enzymes' complicated and precise allosteric regulation (11Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Two subgroups of class I enzymes exist. Both consist of two homodimers, the R1 protein (α2), which contains the active site and the binding site(s) for allosteric effectors, and the R2 protein (β2), which contains a dinuclear iron center and a tyrosyl free radical (11Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Class Ia are found in almost all eucaryotes, large DNA viruses, and several procaryotes, which typically exist in an environment where there is a close association with eucaryotes. Class Ib enzymes are found exclusively in bacteria. Although they show limited overall sequence identity with class Ia enzymes, catalytically important residues are conserved (12Jordan A. Pontis E. Atta M. Krook M. Gibert I. Barbe J. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12892-12896Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Class II enzymes, which occur in many procaryotes, have a simpler structure (α or α2) and use adenosylcobalamin as a cofactor, which is cleaved to produce a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (13Booker S. Licht S. Broderick J. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12676-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Booker S. Stubbe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8352-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Class III enzymes only function under anaerobic conditions and are found in procaryotes. Like class I enzymes, class III enzymes have an α2β2structure; however, they have a glycyl radical on the α subunit, and the β subunit contains an iron sulfur cluster (15Sun X. Ollagnier S. Schmidt P.P. Atta M. Mulliez E. Lepape L. Eliasson R. Graslund A. Fontecave M. Reichard P. Sjoberg B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6827-6831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Chlamydiae have a relatively small genome, approximately 1–1.2 million base pairs. This has facilitated the complete genome sequencing of four isolates C. trachomatis serovar D (16Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L.

In addition, two more genomes, C. psittaci guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis and C. trachomatis serovar L2, are being sequenced. As expected from the results of our metabolic studies (6McClarty G. Tipples G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4922-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Tipples G. McClarty G. Mol.

McClarty G. Salzberg S.L. Eisen J. Fraser C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In agreement with our hydroxyurea sensitivity studies (8Tipples G. McClarty G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4932-4940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the amino acid sequences of the R1 and R2 protein homologues suggest that the chlamydial RNR belongs to class Ia. The chlamydial R1 and R2 protein sequences do show some unusual characteristics. The R1 protein has a calculated molecular mass of 119,000 Da, which is about 30 kDa larger than the prototype class IaEscherichia coli R1, and the R2 protein has a phenylalanine at the position where the essential free radical tyrosine is located in all other class I R2 proteins. To initiate more detailed studies on the chlamydial RNR and to define the molecular mechanism of hydroxyurea resistance in our mutant chlamydiae we cloned, expressed, purified, and raised antibody against both subunits of the enzyme. We demonstrate that despite its rather unusual primary sequence, the chlamydiae RNR is active. Deletion mutagenesis was employed to show that the 30-kDa amino-terminal extension of the chlamydial R1 protein is not essential for enzyme activity, but it is required for the allosteric inhibitory effects of dATP. Results from site-directed mutagenesis studies with the chlamydial R2 protein suggest that tyrosine 129 (chlamydiae numbering) is probably the location of the essential tyrosyl free radical. Finally, our C. trachomatis mutant is resistant to hydroxyurea because it overproduces both the R1 and R2 proteins. [5-3H]CDP and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit used for Western blot analysis were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Hydroxyurea and various nucleotides were purchased from Sigma. DNA cycle sequencing kit, restriction endonucleases, and oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. C. trachomatisL2/434/Bu was originally obtained from C. C. Kuo (University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and has been maintained in our laboratory since that time. An initial description of the hydroxyurea-resistant mutant C. trachomatis L2 isolate (L2HR-25) used in this study has been published (8Tipples G. McClarty G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4932-4940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 (DE3) (hsdS gal λclts857 ind1 Sam7 nin5 lacUV5-T7 gene 1) was obtained from Novagen, Inc. DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 (φ80 lacZΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1) is routinely maintained in our laboratory. Expression vector pET3a was obtained from Novagen, Inc. Wild type HeLa 229 cells are continuously maintained in our laboratory and are routinely cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated (56 °C for 30 min) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% humidified air. HeLa cells were infected with C. trachomatis L2 and the mutant L2HR-25 as described previously (6McClarty G. Tipples G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4922-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tipples G. McClarty G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4932-4940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following infection, the chlamydiae inoculum was removed, and the cell monolayer was washed three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. The chlamydiae-infected cells were cultured in minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml cycloheximide. Highly purified preparations of EBs and RBs were prepared by centrifugation through Renografin density gradients (19Fan H.Z. McClarty G. Brunham R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6670-6677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Caldwell H.D. Kromhout J. Schachter J. Infect. Immun. 1981; 31: 1161-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RBs and EBS were purified from 20–24 h and 40–42 h infected cultures, respectively. The pET expression system (Novagen, Inc.) was used for inducible overexpression of the cloned chlamydial wild type R1, R1Δ1–248, wild type R2, L2HR-25 R2, R2Y129F, R2F127Y, and R2F127Y/Y129F. Initial construction and identification of recombinant plasmids were completed in E. coli DH5α. For protein production, plasmids were transferred to BL21 (DE3). BL21 (DE3) contains a lysogenic λ phage derivative, DE3, carrying the gene for T7 RNA polymerase under the control of an inducible lacUV5promoter. Expression of recombinant proteins cloned into pET expression vectors is from a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Oligonucleotide primers used for the different genes were designed based on the published sequence of the C. trachomatisserovar D or L2 genome (16Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Plasmid pET3a-CTR1 and pET3a-CTR1Δ1–248 express wild type C. trachomatis full-length protein R1 and protein R1 with a deletion of 248 amino acids from the amino terminus, respectively. The DNA inserts of pET3a-CTR1 and pET3a-CTR1Δ1–248 were produced by PCR amplification of wild type C. trachomatis L2 genomic DNA. PCR primers 5′- CCCCTCTAGACATATGGTCGATCTACAAG-3′ and 5′-CCCCTCTAGAGGATCCGCTTGCATAAGAACC-3′ encompassed the initiation and termination codons of the full-length R1 gene encoding a product of 1047 amino acids. For the R1 protein with 248 amino acids deleted at the amino terminus of the protein, encoding a product of 799 amino acids (R1Δ1–248), the PCR primers were 5′-CCCCTCTAGACATATGACGCATTCGCAG and 5′-CCCCTCTAGAGGATCCGCTTGCATAAGAACC-3′. Underlined portions of the oligonucleotide primers indicate theXbaI–NdeI andXbaI–BamHI restriction sites included for cloning purposes. The DNA inserts of pET3a-CTR2 and pET3a-CTHR-25R2 were produced from PCR amplification of wild type C. trachomatis L2 and hydroxyurea-resistantC. trachomatis L2HR-25 genomic DNA, respectively. PCR primers 5′- CCCCGAATTCCATATGCAAGCAGATATTTTAG-3′ and 5′-CCCCGGATCCCTACCAAGTTAAGCTTGC-3′ encompassed the initiation and termination codons of the full-length wild type R2 and L2HR-25 mutant R2 genes encoding products of 346 amino acids. Underlined portions of the oligonucleotide primers indicate theEcoRI–NdeI and BamHI restriction sites included for cloning purposes. PCR, using paired complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired point mutations, was used to introduce specific mutations into wild type C. trachomatis R2 as described previously (21Walker D. Chia W.N. Muirhead H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In all cases, wild type C. trachomatis L2 genomic DNA was used as template. The insert for plasmid pET3aR2Y129F was created using paired complementary primers 5′-GCACACATTTTTGTTTATTTGTG-3′ and 5′-CACAAATAAACAAAAATGTGTGC-3′. The insert for plasmid pET3aR2F127Y was created using paired complementary primers 5′-GCACACATATTTGTATATTTGTG-3′ and 5′-CACAAATATACAAATATGTGTGC-3′, and the insert for plasmid pET3aR2F127Y/Y129F was created using paired complementary primers 5′-GCACACATATTTGTTTATTTGTG-3′ and 5′-CACAAATAAACAAATATGTGTGC-3′. The flanking primers used were those encompassing the initiation and termination codons of the R2 gene as described above. The insert in all plasmid constructs was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Recombinant chlamydial full-length wild type R1 protein, mutant R1Δ1–248, wild type R2 protein, mutant L2HR-25 R2, R2Y129F, R2F127Y, and R2F127Y/Y129F were expressed and purified as described earlier (22Davis R.

The bacterial culture was grown in 600 ml of TB medium in 6-liter flasks with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at 30 °C with vigorous shaking to an OD of 1.0 at 600 nm. At this time the incubator temperature was reduced to 15 °C, and when the OD reached approximately 2, protein expression was induced with IPTG at a final concentration of 50 μm. The cultures were incubated for a further 15–20 h at 15 °C, by which time the OD had typically reached 12–16. All subsequent procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), and repelleted. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.3) and quick frozen at −80 °C. Recombinant chlamydial R1 and R1Δ1–248 were purified by chromatography on a dATP-Sepharose column as described previously for recombinant mouse R1 (22Davis R. Thelander M. Mann G.J. Behravan G. Soucy F. Beaulieu P. Lavallee P. Graslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23171-23176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For full-length protein R1, the column was washed with 0.5 mm ATP, and then protein R1 was eluted with 5 mm ATP. For R1Δ1–248, the column was washed with 0.15 mm ATP and was subsequently eluted with 5 mmATP. Recombinant chlamydial wild type R2, mutant L2HR-25 R2, R2Y129F, R2F127Y, and R2F127Y/Y129F were purified on a DE52 column as described previously for recombinant mouse R2 protein (23Mann G.J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 219: 213-218Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from C. trachomatis L2-infected HeLa cells (3.0 × 107 cells/150-cm2 flask) cultured in complete minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 24 h postinfection using the RNA extraction kit from Qiagen as described previously (26Iliffe-Lee E.R. McClarty G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed using SuperscriptTM Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA resulting from reverse transcription was ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in double distilled H2O, and stored at −20 °C as template for PCR amplification. To detect any changes in the level of expression of the nrd genes, the PCR was maintained in the linear range by using 30 cycles. RT-PCR primers used were as follows: (a) for 23 S rRNA, 5′-GGGTTGTAGGATTGAGGA-3′ and 5′-GTTTTAGGTGGTGCAGGA-3′; (b) within the coding sequence of nrdA, 5′-ATATACACCAGCTACGCCA-3′ and 5-′AAGCATCGTGTAATCCCG-3′; (c) within the coding sequence of nrdB, 5′-TATGGAAGTCGGATCGTC-3′ and 5′-AATCTCCGGGTTCTCTTC-3′; and (d) overlapping the coding sequence of nrdA and nrdB, 5′-CTTTATCTTGCCCAGCCA-3′ and 5′-ATATTGTCTCGCTTCCGG-3′. Mouse polyclonal antibodies against purified recombinant chlamydial R1 and R2 proteins were produced as described previously (27Lacy M.J. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 87: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Wylie J.L. Berry J.D. McClarty G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 631-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cell extract proteins were analyzed on a 10% linear SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis as described previously (29McClarty G.A. Chan A.K.

Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Primary antibody binding was detected with a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ribonucleotide reductase activity was assayed by determining the reduction of CDP as described previously (30Engstrom Y. Eriksson S. Thelander L. Akerman M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Incubation was at 37 °C for 20 min in a final volume of 0.05 ml containing 25 mm Tris-Cl, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 6.4 mm MgCl2, 20 μm FeCl3, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm CDP (20 cpm/pmol). These conditions are referred to as standard assay conditions. One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to 1 nmol of dCDP formed per min.

Serovar L2 R1 protein contains 1047 amino acids, giving a calculated molecular mass of 119 kDa, about 30 kDa larger than prototype E. coli class Ia R1 protein (11Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The deduced R1 protein sequences from the various chlamydiae are approximately the same molecular weight and show about 80% amino acid sequence identity to each other (data not shown). A comparison of the complete amino acid sequence of the chlamydial L2 R1 with that of other R1 proteins in the public data bases (Fig.1 A) provides some interesting information, which is summarized schematically in Fig. 1 C. First, as previously noted by Jordan et al. (31Jordan A. Torrents E. Sala I. Hellman U. Gibert I. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3974-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the chlamydial R1 shows the highest overall sequence identity, 47.7%, to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa R1. Second, as shown in Fig. 1 B, the extended amino-terminal region of the chlamydial R1 protein (amino acids 1–221) appears to be a duplication of approximately 110 amino acids that show highest homology to the N-terminal region of various class II and class III enzymes. Finally, the remainder of the R1 protein (amino acids 220–1047) shows higher homology to full-length eucaryotic R1 proteins (37.1% amino acid identity to mouse R1) than to bacterial class Ia R1 proteins (25.7% amino acid identity to E. coli class Ia R1). Importantly, most of the residues that have been shown to be critical for R1 function (E. coli class Ia numbering is used for clarity), including the active site cysteines (Cys225, Cys439, Cys462), the proposed radical transfer pathway (Tyr730, Tyr731), the cysteines that receive electrons from the external hydrogen donor (Cys754, Cys759), and the asparagine and glutamate residues of the active site (Asn437, Glu441) (11Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 32Eklund H. Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Nordlund P. Logan D. Biochemistry. 1997; 378: 821-825Google Scholar), are all conserved. Furthermore, key residues involved in effector nucleotide binding at the allosteric substrate specificity site are essentially conserved (32Eklund H. Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Nordlund P. Logan D. Biochemistry. 1997; 378: 821-825Google Scholar, 33Jordan A. Torrents E. Jeanthon C. Eliasson R. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Barbe J. Gibert I. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13487-13492Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Since the chlamydial R1 has a duplication of approximately 110 amino acids at the N terminus, it contains three reasonable homologues of the signature sequence VXKRDG (Fig. 1 A), which occurs at the N terminus of R1s that contain an allosteric activity site (11Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 32Eklund H. Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Nordlund P. Logan D. Biochemistry. 1997; 378: 821-825Google Scholar). Serovar L2 R2 protein contains 346 amino acids, a size similar to the prototype E. coli class Ia R2 subunit (11Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The deduced chlamydial R2 protein sequences show about 90% identity at the amino acid level to each other (data not shown). A comparison of the complete amino acid sequence of the chlamydial L2 R2 with that of several other R2 proteins in the public data bases is shown in Fig.2. In general, the chlamydial R2 protein shows lower overall homology to procaryotic R2s (19.5% identity toE. coli R2) than to eucaryotic R2s (23.2% identity to mouse R2); however, as with the R1 protein, the chlamydial R2 shows highest overall homology (54.4% identity) to the P. aeruginosa R2. Most of the residues known to be important for R2 function, including the iron ligands (Glu115, His118, Glu204, Glu238, His241), residues in the hydrophobic pocket surrounding the tyrosyl free radical (Phe208, Phe212, Ile234), and those that participate in the long range radical transport pathway (Trp48, Asp237, Glu350, Tyr356) are conserved. Chlamydial R2 residues that are not conserved are the iron ligand Asp84, which is conservatively substituted with glutamic acid, and a striking change, the critical tyrosyl free radical (Tyr122), which is substituted with phenylalanine. Indeed, of all the R2 protein sequences deposited in the public data bases, only the chlamydial R2s (the Tyr to Phe change is conserved in all six chlamydial R2s) show this change. In E. coli, nrdAB are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA (34Hanke P.D. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1192-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Fuchs J.A. Karlstrom H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 128: 810-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chlamydial genome sequence analysis indicates that there are 37 bases between the predicted TAA stop codon of nrdA and the ATG start codon of nrdB (16Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q. Koonin E.V. Davis R.W. Science. 1998; 282: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). This organization suggests that chlamydial nrdAB may be transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA. Since it has proven difficult to do Northern blots for chlamydial metabolic gene transcripts and the absence of consensus promoter sequences (36Mathews S.A. Sriprakash K.S. J.

Primer pairs were chosen within nrdA andnrdB coding sequences as well as a pair that spanned the two open reading frames. As shown in Fig.3 A, all primer pairs gave"
https://openalex.org/W1985746492,"We studied the fine spatial structure of the receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells and its relationship to the dendritic geometry of these cells. Cells from which recordings had been made were microinjected with Lucifer yellow, so that responses generated at precise locations within the receptive field center could be directly compared with that cell's dendritic structure. While many cells with small receptive fields had dome-shaped sensitivity profiles, the majority of large receptive fields were composed of multiple regions of high sensitivity. The density of dendritic branches at any one location did not predict the regions of high sensitivity. Instead, the interactions between a ganglion cell's dendritic tree and the local mosaic of bipolar cell axons seem to define the fine structure of the receptive field center."

By adding the functionality of a cofactor to the protein matrix, enzymes have found a way of expanding their catalytic power that has led to an enormous collection of different biocatalysts. For the various types of cofactors observed in nature, different molecular approaches of cofactor binding and anchoring have been identified. Flavoproteins represent one of the major groups of cofactor-dependent enzymes (1Ghisla S. Massey V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 2Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). However, data on the molecular process of FAD or FMN binding are scarce, while only a limited number of flavoprotein structures in the apo form are known (3Sandalova T. Lindqvist Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 4Steensma E. van Mierlo C.P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 653-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Mattevi A. Tedeschi G. Bacchella L. Coda A. Negri A. Ronchi S. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A striking example of the importance of efficient FAD binding was recently shown for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (6Guenther B.D. Sheppard C.A. Tran P. Rozen R. Matthews R.G. Ludwig M.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). A commonly found point mutation in the corresponding human gene results in a decreased cofactor affinity, which can lead to severe inborn health problems e.g. neural-tube defects and Down syndrome. For a better understanding of the process of flavin binding, we have started a study on the process of flavinylation in vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO).1 VAO (EC 1.1.3.38) is a FAD-dependent enzyme capable of oxidizing a wide range of phenolic substrates providing the fungusPenicillium simplicissimum with a tool for metabolizing aromatic compounds (7Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18111-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The structure of VAO encompasses 560 residues and a fully buried covalently bound FAD cofactor (Fig. 1) (8Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The VAO monomer consists of two α/β domains: residues 1–270 and 500–560 form a FAD binding domain, while the intervening residues form the so-called cap domain. The active site is located in the core of the protein, at the interface of the two domains with the flavin being covalently linked to His-422 of the cap domain. From a sequence alignment study it was recognized that VAO is a representative of a novel flavoprotein family, whose members share a conserved FAD binding domain (9Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The recent unforeseen discovery of the same FAD binding fold in CO dehydrogenase indicates that this FAD binding module is widespread among flavoproteins (10Dobbek H. Gremer L. Meyer O. Huber R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8884-8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Recently, we have performed an in-depth study on the role of the covalent histidyl-FAD bond in VAO (11Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35514-35520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Covalent anchoring of a flavin cofactor has been encountered in a variety of other flavin-dependent oxidoreductases, while the rationale for this type of cofactor attachment has remained obscure for a long time (12Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Our recent study showed that deletion of the histidyl bond, by replacing His-422 by an alanine, resulted in an active VAO variant containing a noncovalently but tightly bound FAD cofactor. Determination of the structure of this mutant enzyme revealed that rupture of the covalent link does not have any effect on the active site architecture or any other part of the protein structure. Kinetic analysis, however, revealed that the mutant enzyme displays a 10-fold decrease in activity, which is due to a significantly lowered flavin redox potential (−65 mV) with respect to the wild-type enzyme (+55 mV). This drastic decrease in redox potential can fully explain the altered flavin reactivity, indicating that the covalent tethering of the cofactor might have evolved to fine tune the redox properties of the cofactor. In the process of covalent His422-FAD bond formation, His-61 is thought to play an important role (8Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Trickey P. Wagner M.A. Jorns M.S. Mathews F.S. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 331-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar). His-61 is envisaged to deprotonate the neighboring His-422 as the shortest distance between the imidazole rings is only about 2.5 Å. By this, His-422 is able to attack the activated 8α-methyl group of the FAD cofactor creating the covalent linkage (12Mewies M. McIntire W.S. Scrutton N.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To examine the functional role of His-61 in the process of flavinylation, we have substituted this residue by a threonine. In this paper, we report on the structural and catalytic properties of the H61T mutant. Furthermore, it presents the first x-ray structural studies of an apo form of a flavoenzyme that normally contains a covalent FAD cofactor. Escherichia coli strain DH5F′ and the plasmids pUCBM20 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and pGEM-5Zf(+) (Promega) were used for cloning throughout, whereas E. colistrain TG2 and the plasmid pEMBL19(−) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used for expression of the vaoA gene. Oligonucleotides, T4 DNA ligase, restriction enzymes, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, yeast extract, and tryptone extract were from Life Technologies, Inc. Forward M13 and reverse M13 sequencing primers were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Pwo DNA polymerase and dNTPs were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Super Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from HT Biotechnology. Ampicillin, riboflavin, ADP, AMP, FMN, NAD+, and NADP+ were from Sigma. 4-(Methoxymethyl)phenol was obtained from Aldrich. All other chemicals were from Merck and were of the purest grade available. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (11Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35514-35520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For the His-61 replacement by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis, the oligonucleotide 5′ CGCACGATCCCACTCATGTCATGGACCAGG 3′ (where ACT denotes the His-61 → Thr replacement) was used. Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by plasmid sequencing. The H61T mutant protein was expressed and purified as described previously (11Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35514-35520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). By extensive gel permeation of holo H61T, virtually all FAD could be released. The FAD content in the apoprotein preparations was <0.1% as evidenced by the flavin absorbance at 439 nm. Steady-state kinetic parameters of H61T were determined by using saturating conditions for cofactor binding (100 μm FAD), essentially as described earlier (7Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18111-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Tryptophan fluorescence was measured using a Aminco SPF-500 fluorimeter. Crystals were obtained using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at similar conditions (4% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm sodium acetate/HCl, pH 5.1) that were used for crystallizing wild-type VAO (14Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 601-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Crystals of the H61T mutant in both the apo and the holo form (size typically ∼0.2 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm3) were isomorphous to those of wild-type enzyme, and they belong to space group I4. A complete data set was collected at 100 K using a single crystal. Before freezing, the crystals were briefly transferred to a solution containing 10% w/v polyethylene glycol 400, 5% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000, 10% v/v glycerol, and 100 mm acetate/HCl, pH 5.1. Data were measured on the following beam lines: beam line X11 of the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron/Europeon Molecular Biology Laboratory (Hamburg, Germany) for the holoprotein crystal soaked in 1.0 mm 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol and beam line ID14-EH3 of European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) for the apoprotein and the apoprotein soaked in 1.0 mm ADP. The structures were solved by difference Fourier methods and maximum likelihood refinement using REFMAC (15Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1E8F, 1E8G, and 1E8H). Purification and characterization of H61T revealed that the mutation did not abolish enzyme activity. However, it was found that during the purification the protein readily lost activity, which could be restored by supplementing the protein solution with FAD. This indicated that the mutant has only a moderate affinity for FAD. Unfolding of the purified protein confirmed that no covalently bound FAD is formed in the H61T mutant confirming the crucial role of this residue in the autocatalytical covalent tethering of the prosthetic group. Kinetic analysis revealed that the turnover rate of H61T was decreased by 1 order of magnitude when compared with wild-type VAO (Table II). The effect on enzyme activity can well be explained by an decreased redox potential of the cofactor due to the missing covalent bond (11Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35514-35520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In fact, the observed effect on the activity was anticipated as it has been shown that merely disruption of the covalent His-FAD bond results in a 10-fold decrease in activity due to a changed redox potential of the cofactor, while the mutation was not expected to have a direct effect on the catalytic function of the enzyme as the respective residue is far from the active site (distance between the imidazole ring of His-61 and the FAD N5 atom is >10 Å). Unfortunately, attempts to determine the redox potential of the mutant enzyme were unsuccessful due the moderate affinity for FAD. As a consequence a solution of the mutant enzyme contains relatively large amounts of unbound FAD. Spectral interference of the fraction of free FAD prevented an unambiguous redox potential determination of the mutant enzyme.Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters of wild-type, H422A and H61T VAO for the oxidation of 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 25 °C)ParameterWild-type 2-aData from Ref. 7.H422A 2-bData from Ref. 11.H61TKm (μm)553440kcat (s−1)3.10.270.24kcat/Km(mm−1·s−1)567.96.02-a Data from Ref. 7Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H.

Open table in a new tab The binding affinity for FAD to the mutant enzyme was determined using tryptophan fluorescence quenching: Kd = 1.8 μm. The noncovalent binding of the FAD cofactor could also be demonstrated by the inhibitory effects of some FAD-related compounds. Of all tested FAD derivatives (riboflavin, FMN, NAD+, NADP+, AMP, and ADP) only the addition of AMP or ADP resulted in a decreased enzyme activity. ADP was found to be an effective competitive inhibitor, indicating that the FAD binding largely depends on binding of the ADP moiety of the cofactor, a frequently observed feature in FAD binding enzymes (20van der Laan J.M.

Biochem. 1999; 260: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Binding of ADP could also be measured by using tryptophan fluorescence, showing a similar affinity (Kd = 2.1 μm) when compared with FAD. The data for both FAD and ADP binding were consistent with a single site binding process. However, binding of ADP resulted in less fluorescence quenching. This might be related to the fact that in the VAO structure, Trp-413 is close to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. Due to the impairment in covalent flavinylation, the apo form of H61T could be purified in large amounts, which opened up possibilities to explore the process of FAD binding. Both the apo and the holo form of H61T showed similar hydrodynamic behavior: they form octamers of about 500 kDa (23van Berkel W.J.H. van den Heuvel R.H.H. Versluis C. Heck A.J.R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and can be crystallized using similar conditions as found for wild-type enzyme. By solving the crystal structures of both the apo- and the holoenzyme (Table I), we have been able to examine the structural effects associated with FAD binding. Comparison of the mutant holo form structure with the previously solved wild-type structure (8Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) established that the His-61 replacement and the resulting missing covalent histidyl-FAD bond does not induce gross conformational changes. Except for a perturbation in the loop region Met64–Tyr68, displaying a maximal shift of 4.5 Å, the Cα atoms superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 0.46 Å for 910 equivalent positions (i.e. the two VAO subunits present in the asymmetric unit). The loop movement is far from both the cofactor, and the active site and is probably caused by altered interactions due to the mutation. The active site architecture and mode of flavin binding of H61T is strictly conserved when compared with the wild-type enzyme. These observations support the notion that by mutating His-61 we have specifically inhibited the process of covalent flavinylation, while the mutant has retained appreciable activity. This also illustrates the dual catalytic potential of VAO as the enzyme is able to catalyze two totally different redox reactions: formation of the covalent histidyl-FAD bond and oxidation of phenolic compounds. To explore the conservation of substrate binding, the crystals of holo H61T were soaked in a solution containing 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol, a competitive inhibitor. Inspection of the electron density map showed strong density for a bound 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol molecule in the active site. The benzylic ring of the substrate analog is stacked almost parallel to the plane of the isoalloxazine ring (13°), while the phenolic oxygen makes a hydrogen bond with Tyr-503. As all fluorine atoms are resolved, it can be nicely seen that one fluorine atom is directly pointing toward the reactive N5 atom of the flavin ring (Fig. 2). The distance between the Cα atom and the flavin N5 atom (3.7 Å) and the angles Cα-F-N5 (132°) and Cα-N5-N10 (114°) are fully compatible with a direct hydride transfer, which is in line with the previously proposed catalytic mechanism (7Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18111-18116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, the observed orientation of the ligand is similar to the binding mode of phenolic inhibitors in other complexed VAO structures (8Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), confirming conservation of the active site architecture. To exemplify the high degree of similarity of inhibitor binding between different liganded VAO structures, the isoeugenol complexed structures of wild-type VAO (8Mattevi A. Fraaije M.W. Mozzarelli A. Olivi L. Coda A. van Berkel W.J.H. Structure. 1997; 5: 907-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the H422A VAO variant (11Fraaije M.W. van den Heuvel R.H.H. van Berkel W.J.H. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35514-35520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entries 2VAO and 1QLU, respectively) were compared with the 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol complexed H61T structure. Analysis of the superimposed active sites yields the following key parameters for inhibitor binding: the hydrogen bond distances between Tyr-503 and the hydroxyl group of the ligands are 2.4, 2.7, and 2.5 Å respectively, the distances between flavin N5 and the Cα atom of the inhibitor is 3.5, 3.5, and 3.7 Å, respectively, while the phenolic ring is at a conserved angle with respect to the plane of the isoalloxazine ring (18, 8, and 13°, respectively). Structure determination of the apo form of H61T revealed a remarkable detailed resemblance with the holoenzyme structure. Superposition of the Cα atoms did not reveal any significant cofactor-induced conformational change, which is reflected in a root mean square deviation of only 0.33 Å. Consequently, a huge solvent-filled cavity (420 Å3) is found in the apoenzyme structure complementary with the missing cofactor (Fig. 3 A). When the effect of FAD binding on the active site architecture is taken under scrutiny, only a few notable changes can be observed when compared with the holoenzyme (Fig. 3 B). Particularly, comparison between the mutant holo and apo form structures shows that only the side chains of Asn-105 and Ser-106 have altered positions, whereas all other active site residues superimpose with a root mean square deviation of <0.4 Å. These results indicate that, prior to binding of the cofactor, the apoprotein is fully folded, awaiting FAD binding. Along with the apoenzyme structure, also the structure of the binary complex with ADP was determined at 2.6 Å. Similar to FAD binding, binding of ADP did not induce any structural changes as evidenced by a root mean square deviation of only 0.30 Å for all Cα atoms when compared with the apoenzyme structure. The cofactor binding capability of the folded apoprotein could be demonstrated by soaking the colorless apoenzyme crystals in a FAD containing solution. Binding of FAD was completed within a few minutes as subsequent washing of the FAD soaked crystals resulted in bright yellow crystals. Furthermore, these FAD reconstituted enzyme crystals were also active as evidenced by substrate oxidation upon incubation with 4-(methoxymethyl)phenol. Apparently, the folded apoenzyme, even in the crystalline state, is malleable enough to allow the relatively large cofactor to enter the preorganized binding pocket resulting in the active holoenzyme. However, although the active site is nearly conserved in the apo form, soaking of apoenzyme crystals with substrate analogs did not result in ligand binding. This indicates that the positioning of the isoalloxazine ring system is a prerequisite for substrate binding, which is different from the situation in e.g. p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (24Müller F. van Berkel W.J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Schreuder H.A. Mattevi A. Obmolova G. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. van der Bolt F.J.T. van Berkel W.J.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10161-10170Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The similarity between the mutant structures in the holo and apo form clearly indicate that FAD binding does not involve an induced fit mechanism nor that the cofactor is required to attain the catalytically relevant conformation of the active site. Rather, both cofactor and substrate bind via a typical lock-and-key approach to highly preorganized binding sites. The observed lock-and-key mechanism for FAD binding is likely to apply to other flavoproteins. In particular, analysis of the recently discovered flavoprotein family of VAO related protein sequences shows that the most conserved residues are lining the FAD binding pocket (9Fraaije M.W. van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A. Visser J. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 206-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggesting conservation in the mechanism of flavinylation. The reported crystallographic data provide detailed insight in the protein-ligand interactions involved in flavin-mediated catalysis. Combined with the recently solved structures of VAO, we now have a clear view on the molecular trajectory of enzyme assembly in VAO, which is composed of the following steps: 1) the polypeptide folds and oligomerizes (23van Berkel W.J.H. van den Heuvel R.H.H. Versluis C. Heck A.J.R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) to yield apoprotein, 2) FAD is encapsulated by a highly preorganized cofactor binding cavity, 3) autocatalytical covalent flavinylation results in cofactor activation enabling efficient redox catalysis. By this, we have gained valuable information on the process of flavin binding that will aid in understanding the biological process of cofactor recognition, binding, and subsequent activation of apoenzymes.

The catalytic mechanism of the whole pathway was investigated in three separate chemical steps. In the first decarboxylation step, the enzyme loses oxalacetate decarboxylation activity upon incubation with EDTA. Activity is fully restored by addition of Mg(II) and is not restored with other divalent metal cations. The dissociation constant of 0.93 × 10−7 for Mg(II) and atomic absorption analysis established a 1:1 stoichiometric complex. Inhibition of pyruvate formation with 2-pyrone revealed that the actual product in the first step is a pyruvate enolate, which undergoes C–C bond formation in the presence of 2-pyrone. Incubation of substrate analogs provided aberrant adducts that were produced via C–C bond formation and rearrangement. This strongly indicates that the second step is two C–C bond formations, affording a bicyclic intermediate.

( Tokyo ). 1988; 36: 1328-1335Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) from an unidentified C3 unit precursor and 2-pyrone 1 (SchemeFS1) to benzoate (macrophomic acid2) (3Sakurai I. Miyajima H. Akiyama K. Shimizu S. Yamamoto Y. Chem. Pharm. Bull. ( Tokyo ). 1988; 36: 2003-2011Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This type of aromatic compound is commonly biosynthesized via either a shikimate or polyketide pathway. Based on the biosynthetic studies (1Sakurai I. Suzuki H. Shimizu S. Yamamoto Y. Chem. Pharm. Bull. ( Tokyo ). 1985; 33: 5141-5143Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), it was shown that this conversion requires at least decarboxylation and two C–C bond formations. Although M. commelinae produced 2 in a small amount and a number of 2-pyrones (3Sakurai I. Miyajima H. Akiyama K. Shimizu S. Yamamoto Y. Chem. Pharm. Bull. ( Tokyo ). 1988; 36: 2003-2011Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), precursor 1 was not detected in the culture. The structurally related phytotoxins pyrenocine A (3) (4Sato H. Konoma K. Sakamura S.

Chem. 1981; 45: 1675-1679Google Scholar) have been found in the culture of the pathogenic fungus Pyrenochaeta terrestris by our laboratory, indicating involvement of a similar biosynthetic pathway. The uniqueness of this transformation led us to investigate details of the biosynthetic pathway. The enzymatic activity was induced in the presence of 2-pyrone 1 and detected in the cell extract (7Oikawa, H., Yagi, K., Watanabe, K., Honma, M., and Ichihara, A. (1997)J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 97–98.Google Scholar). Subsequently, the unidentified precursor required in the enzymatic transformation was determined as oxalacetate (8Oikawa H. Watanabe K. Yagi K. Ohashi S. Mie T. Ichihara A. Honma M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 6983-6986Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Watanabe K. Oikawa H. Yagi K. Ohashi S. Mie T. Ichihara A. Honma M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 127: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This finding allowed us to purify the enzyme named macrophomate synthase (8Oikawa H. Watanabe K. Yagi K. Ohashi S. Mie T. Ichihara A. Honma M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 6983-6986Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Watanabe K. Oikawa H. Yagi K. Ohashi S. Mie T. Ichihara A. Honma M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 127: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Macrophomate synthase is a homodimer of a 36-kDa protein and shows a unique substrate selectivity to convert various 2-pyrones to benzoates (10Watanabe K. Mie T. Ichihara A. Oikawa H. Honma M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The single enzyme catalyzes an extraordinary five-step transformation involving two decarboxylations, two C–C bond formations, and dehydration. To our knowledge, there is no precedent of an enzyme catalyzing different types of multistep chemical reactions, except dehydroquinate synthase (11Bender S.L. Widlanski T.S. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7560-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the mechanistically related deoxy-scyllo-inosose synthase (12Kudo F. Hosomi Y. Tamegai H. Kakinuma K. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 52: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Kudo F. Tamegai H. Fujiwara T. Tagami U. Hirayama K. Kakinuma K. J. Antibiot. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 52: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding macrophomate synthase from M. commelinae has recently been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli(9Watanabe K. Oikawa H. Yagi K. Ohashi S. Mie T. Ichihara A. Honma M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 127: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments show that it has no homology to known enzymes reported to date. The observation that pyruvate is also active as a substrate instead of oxalacetate and that a bicyclic intermediate mimic (8Oikawa H. Watanabe K. Yagi K. Ohashi S. Mie T. Ichihara A. Honma M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 6983-6986Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) inhibits the conversion catalyzed by macrophomate synthase led us to divide this complicated transformation into three independent chemical reactions: 1) decarboxylation of oxalacetate, 2) two C–C bond formations to afford the bicyclic intermediate 5, and 3) decomposition of5 via dehydration-decarboxylation. Isolation of a bicyclic intermediate analog (14Watanabe K. Mie T. Ichihara A. Oikawa H. Honma M. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 1443-1446Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) during incubation of the simple 2-pyrone methyl coumalate provided strong support for this mechanism; however, the detailed mechanism is still unknown. Since none of the putative enzyme-bound intermediates has been isolated, it is suggested that each step appears to be essentially irreversible. This makes it extremely difficult to study the mechanism of macrophomate synthase with the natural substrate. To address the individual steps, studies on decarboxylation in the absence of 2-pyrone and incubation of substrate analogs have been carried out. In this study, we report the cofactor requirements, kinetic studies for individual reactions, experimental evidence for the involvement of the plausible bicyclic intermediate, and mechanistic details of the extraordinary enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Macrophomate synthase was purified from the E. colioverproducing strain BL21 harboring the gene, which encodes macrophomate synthase from M. commelinae as described earlier (9Watanabe K. Oikawa H. Yagi K. Ohashi S. Mie T. Ichihara A. Honma M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 127: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). NADH, NAD+, malate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and fumarate hydratase were obtained from Sigma. The lactate dehydrogenase was purified on a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column since the enzyme was contaminated with 2% malate dehydrogenase. The purified lactate dehydrogenase had a specific activity of 357.0 units of protein. Methyl coumalate 6 (see Scheme FS2) and methyl 6-methylcoumalate 12 were prepared as described (15Yamada K. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1962; 35: 1323-1329Crossref Google Scholar). Other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available. Protein concentrations of enzyme preparations were determined either by measuring absorbance at 280 nm or using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine immunoglobulin G as a standard. The oxalacetate decarboxylase activities of macrophomate synthase were examined by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADH (ε340 = 6.22 mm−1cm−1) to NAD in the presence of lactate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the reduction of pyruvate formed by macrophomate synthase. Both sample and reference cuvettes contained 50 mm PIPES1 (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm NADH in a total volume of 1.97 ml. The mixture was preincubated at 30 °C for 2 min and then for a further 1 min after addition of lactate dehydrogenase (10 μl, 3.6 μg). The reaction was started by addition of macrophomate synthase (20 μl, 94 μg) to the sample cuvettes, whereas 50 mm PIPES (20 μl) was added to the reference cuvette. The oxidation of NADH was followed at 340 nm for 30 s at 30 °C. Macrophomate synthase (1 ml, 6.1 mg) in PIPES (pH 7.2) was filtered through a HiTrap desalting column (5 ml × 2; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with MilliQ water to collect the enzyme (1.5 ml, 6.1 mg). To this solution was added Chelex resin (0.5 ml, AG-50W-X8 resin; Bio-Rad). Magnesium content was determined with a Hitachi Z-5010 polarized Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Measurements were carried out in triplicate, with experimental error <5%. Divalent metal ions were removed from 50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0, 1 ml) containing macrophomate synthase (6.1 mg) by adding 5 mm EDTA (10 μl) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by filtration through a HiTrap desalting column (5 ml × 2) to yield an apoenzyme solution (1.5 ml, 4.1 mg). Assay of this solution gave <1.2% the rate of an assay performed in the presence of 0.1 mmmagnesium(II) chloride. The decarboxylase activities of apomacrophomate synthase were examined in the presence of the following metal ions (0.1 mm each): CuSO4, MnCl2, CoCl2, ZnSO4, FeSO4, FeCl2, Fe2(SO4)3, FeCl2, MgCl2, CaCl2, and SnCl2. Portions of each solution were assayed for catalytic activity as described above, except that no additional Mg(II) was present in the assay buffer. The decarboxylase activities of apomacrophomate synthase were examined in the presence of MgCl2 at defined concentrations (0.001–2 μm). Portions of each solution were assayed for catalytic activity as described above, except that no additional Mg(II) was present in the assay buffer. 2-Pyrone 6 (0.1 m) in ethanol (0.5 ml, 50 μmol) was added to 50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0, 10 ml) containing macrophomate synthase (380 μg) and 5 mmMgCl2. After preincubation at 30 °C for 5 min, a 0.1m aqueous solution of oxalacetate (0.5 ml, 50 μmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was vortexed and then incubated at 30 °C for 4 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with H2O/MeOH (8:2, 15 ml), and the mixture was divided into five portions. Each portion was loaded onto a Sep-Pak C18column (Millipore Corp.), and the column was washed with H2O/MeOH (8:2, 5 ml). The adsorbed materials were eluted with MeOH. The eluates were combined and concentrated in vacuo to afford 8 (1.7 mg, 22%) as a pale yellow oil.8: [α]d22 = +25.5° (c 0.17, MeOH); IR (CHCl3) ηmax2924, 1790, 1716, 1645, 1441, 1261, 1047, 955, 801 cm−1; 1H NMR (270 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.07 (m, 1H, C5-H), 5.58 (dd, J = 5.9 and 1.5 Hz, 1H, C3-H), 3.75 (s, 3H, OCH3), 3.65 (d, J = 5.9 Hz, 1H, C2-H), 3.04 (dd, J = 20.2 and 3.0 Hz, 1H, C6-H), 2.62 (dd, J = 20.2 and 2.7 Hz, 1H, C6-H); 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3) δ 176.3 (C8), 171.5 (C1), 164.1 (C9), 142.6 (C5), 131.9 (C4), 73.2 (C7), 70.9 (C3), 52.3 (C2), 52.2 (C10), 34.2 (C6); MS (FD+), m/z (relative intensity) 243 (M+ + H, 100); FD-HRMS for C10H11O7 (M+ + H): 243.0505 calculated, 243.0487 found.

After preincubation at 30 °C for 5 min, a 0.1 m aqueous solution of oxalacetate (0.5 ml, 50 μmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was vortexed and then incubated at 30 °C for 4 h. HCl (2 m, 100 μl) was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. Trimethylsilyldiazomethane in hexane (10% (v/v), 0.65 mmol, 0.5 ml) was added to a solution of the residue in benzene/MeOH (3.5:1, 4.5 ml). The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 30 min and then concentrated in vacuo. Purification by preparative thin-layer silica gel chromatography (CHCl3/MeOH, 95:5) gave dimethyl ester 14 (9.3 mg, 69%) as a pale yellow oil and recovered starting material (1.3 mg, 24%). 14: [α]d22 = −4.6° (c0.65, CHCl3); IR (CHCl3) ηmax3424, 2958, 2360, 1791, 1636, 1436, 1261, 1123, 959, 759 cm−1; 1H NMR (270 MHz, CDCl3) δ 5.60 (d, J = 5.77Hz, 1H, C3-H), 3.74 (s, 3H, OCH3), 3.65 (s, 3H, OCH3), 3.49 (d, J = 5.77 Hz, 1H, C2-H), 3.01 (d, J = 19.4 Hz, 1H, C6-H), 2.49 (d, J = 19.4 Hz, 1H, C6-H), 2.09 (s, 3H, C5-H3); 13C NMR (67.5 MHz, CDCl3) δ 175.9 (C8), 166.9 (C1), 161.0 (C10), 132.9 (C5), 124.5 (C4), 73.1 (C3), 72.9 (C7), 52.5 (C2), 52.4 (OCH3), 52.1 (OCH3), 41.4 (C6), 21.1 (C12); MS (FD+), m/z (relative intensity) 270 (M+, 100); HRMS (FD+) for C12H14O7 (M+): 270.0739 calculated, 270.0764 found. A 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (2H2O, pD 6.6, 2 ml) containing 80 mm fumarate and 0.57 mg of fumarate hydratase was incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Acetone was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The resultant (3R,2S)-[3-2H]malate was used in the next reaction without further purification. For preparation of (2S)-[3-2H2]malate, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (2H2O, pD 6.6, 2 ml) containing 50 mm oxalacetate, 50 mm NADH, and 0.076 mg of malate dehydrogenase was incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The resultant (2S)-[3-2H2]malate was used in the next reaction without further purification. A 0.5m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 2 ml) containing the2H-labeled malate prepared above, 50 mmNAD+, 5 mm 2-pyrone 12, 0.076 mg of malate dehydrogenase, and 6.4 mg of macrophomate synthase was incubated at 30 °C for 14 h. The same operation described above provided2H-labeled dimethyl ester 14. Similarly, incubation of 2-pyrone 1 with the 2H-labeled malate prepared above for 9 h, methylation with trimethylsilyldiazomethane, and purification by preparative thin-layer silica gel chromatography (CHCl3/MeOH, 9:1) afforded2H-labeled 2a. Incubation of 2-pyrone 6 or 12 with macrophomate synthase (3.5 μg) was carried out under essentially the same conditions reported previously (9Watanabe K. Oikawa H. Yagi K. Ohashi S. Mie T. Ichihara A. Honma M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 127: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in the presence of 20 mm oxalacetate. The concentrations of 2-pyrone 6or 12 were 2.2, 2.8, 4.0, 6.7, and 20 mm. After incubation for 5 min, the same volume of 2-propanol and a 2-fold volume of water were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was filtered by EB-DISK (0.45 μm; Cica), and an aliquot of the filtrate was directly injected into the HPLC system. The HPLC analytical conditions were as we described previously (10Watanabe K. Mie T. Ichihara A. Oikawa H. Honma M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Formation of aberrant products was monitored by consumption of 6 or 12. The retention times of 2-pyrones 6 and 12 are 14.5 and 21.6 min, respectively. The first step of the transformation catalyzed by macrophomate synthase was proposed to be decarboxylation (9Watanabe K. Oikawa H. Yagi K. Ohashi S. Mie T. Ichihara A. Honma M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 2000; 127: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of 2-pyrone1, the decarboxylation activity with oxalacetate was examined by lactate dehydrogenase-coupled assay. Rapid formation of pyruvate was observed in the enzymatic reaction monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADH. Based on the kinetic constants determined from initial velocity studies (TableI), macrophomate synthase displayed a 13-fold lower Km for oxalacetate (0.09 mm) during decarboxylation than that during formation of2 (1.2 mm). The kcat(16.3 s−1) during decarboxylation was also 27 times larger than that during formation of 2 (0.60 s−1). These values indicate that macrophomate synthase catalyzes pyruvate formation more efficiently than formation of 2.Table ISteady-state parameters for macrophomate synthaseSubstrateKmVmaxkcatKimmμmol min−1 mg−1s−1mm1.

Our previous results revealed that macrophomate synthase requires Mg(II) for its catalysis and that it is inhibited by divalent metal cations such as Hg(II), Zn(II), and Cu(II). In this study, the metal requirement of decarboxylation with macrophomate synthase was investigated by preparation of apoenzyme and reconstitution experiments with metal cations. Gel filtration of the purified enzyme with a metal-free buffer provided a fully active Mg(II) enzyme complex of 1:1 stoichiometry as determined by atomic absorption analysis. Treatment of the purified enzyme with 5 mm EDTA resulted in a rapid loss of catalytic activity to form the apoenzyme. Various metal cations were added to this apoenzyme, and the enzymatic activity was examined. Only Mg(II) restored full catalytic activity, whereas the others were essentially ineffective (data not shown). The behavior upon gel filtration and the EDTA requirement at relatively higher concentrations for removing Mg(II) suggested that Mg(II) is tightly associated with the enzyme. Hence, we determined the dissociation constant for Mg(II). At different concentrations of Mg(II) (0.001–2 μm), the enzymatic activities for decarboxylation were measured and plotted as a function of Mg(II) concentration (Fig. 1). A dissociation constant for Mg(II) was calculated from the data to be 0.93 × 10−7 at pH 7.2. The apoenzyme restored its maximum activity at 1.5 μm MgCl2. Considering that the concentration of the enzyme in this experiment was 1.2 μm (47 mg/ml), the stoichiometry of magnesium binding was calculated as one/apoenzyme. These data support the result obtained from the atomic absorption analysis. Inhibition studies were carried out to elucidate the effect of 2-pyrone against pyruvate formation. 2-Pyrone 1was a competitive inhibitor with respect to oxalacetate since double-reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/S at saturating conditions of oxalacetate intersected on the 1/vaxis (Fig. 2). Since formation of pyruvate was suppressed by the binding of 2-pyrone, this suggests that the product of oxalacetate is not quenched with water and undergoes further reaction with 2-pyrone. During the study of the substrate selectivity of macrophomate synthase (10Watanabe K. Mie T. Ichihara A. Oikawa H. Honma M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we found that a simple 2-pyrone, methyl coumalate (6), was consumed very rapidly. However, the expected benzoate 7 was not detected during HPLC analysis (Scheme FS2). These observations suggest that an intermediate or its derivative is released from the active site of the enzyme. Preparative scale incubations gave product 8, which was significantly decomposed during the isolation and purification steps. For this reason, the product was transformed into dimethyl ester 9with diazomethane treatment (Scheme FS2). This material was sufficiently stable for data collection. Among 14 substrates tested (10Watanabe K. Mie T. Ichihara A. Oikawa H. Honma M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar),6 revealed the highest conversion rate. Based on the molecular formula C10H10O7 obtained from HRMS, it was suggested that 8 is formed from 6 and oxalacetate, with concomitant loss of carbon dioxide. The NMR data including 1H and 13C NMR, COSY, and heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra allowed us to deduce the partial structure of 9, and then the gross structure was determined by heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) analysis as shown in Fig. 3 a. The relative stereochemistry of 9 was determined by the relative intensities of the cross-peaks that originated from3 JC,H correlation in the HMBC spectrum optimized for 3 JC,H = 7 Hz (Fig. 3 b) (16Bax A. Summers M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2093-2094Crossref Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). To confirm the relative stereochemistry,9 was converted to trimethyl ester 10 by methanolysis of the lactone moiety (Scheme FS2). The large coupling constant (9.4 Hz) between H-2 and H-3 observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of 10 showed that these protons are in an anti-periplanar relationship. These data unambiguously confirmed the relative stereochemistry of 8, 9, and10 (14Watanabe K. Mie T. Ichihara A. Oikawa H. Honma M. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 1443-1446Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our next task was determination of the absolute configuration of10. For this purpose, we applied the method developed by Fukushi et al. (17Fukushi Y. Yajima C. Mizutani J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 599-602Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) since the steric hindrance of the secondary alcohol at C-3 was expected. Trimethyl ester 10was converted to the corresponding (aR)- and (aS)-2′-methoxy-1′,1′-binaphthyl-2-carboxylic acid (MBNC) esters 11a and 11b, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2095122773,"At inhibitory synapses on a cerebellar Purkinje neuron, the depolarization caused by heterosynaptic climbing fiber activation induces long-lasting potentiation accompanied by an increase in GABAA receptor responsiveness. Here we show that activation of a presynaptic inhibitory interneuron during the conditioning postsynaptic depolarization suppresses the potentiation. The suppression is due to postsynaptic GABAB receptor activation by GABA released from presynaptic terminals. The results suggest that GABAB receptor activation decreases the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase through the Gi/Go proteins. The presynaptic activity-dependent suppression of synaptic plasticity is a novel regulatory mechanism of synaptic efficacy at individual synapses and may contribute to the learning and computational ability of the cerebellar cortex."

This method was used because there are no convenient radiolabeled substrates for the transporter. Oocytes injected with crnA mRNA showed nitrate-, nitrite-, and chlorite-dependent currents. Although the gene was originally identified by chlorate selection there was no evidence for transport of this anion. The gene selection is explained by the high affinity of the transporter for chlorite, and the fact that this ion contaminates solutions of chlorate. The pH-dependence of the anion-elicited currents was consistent with H+-coupled mechanism of transport. At any given voltage, currents showed hyperbolic kinetics with respect to extracellular H+, and these data could be fitted with a Michaelis-Menten relationship. But this equation did not adequately describe transport of the anion substrates. At higher concentrations of the anion substrates and more negative membrane voltages, the currents were decreased, but this effect was independent of changes in external pH. These more complicated kinetics could be fit by an equation containing two Michaelis-Menten terms. The substrate inhibition of the currents could be explained by a transport reaction cycle that included two routes for the transfer of nitrate across the membrane, one on the empty carrier and the other proton coupled. The model predicts that the substrate inhibition of transporter current depends on the cytosolic nitrate concentration.

The physiological significance of these observations is discussed. nitrate-nitrite porter external pH polymerase chain reaction 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid Nitrate is an important nitrogen source for many organisms ranging from bacteria and cyanobacteria to fungi and plants. Nitrate carriers for transport across the plasma membrane must be present in many different cell types. In fungi, nitrate transport has been demonstrated in Penicillium chrysogenum (1Goldsmith J. Livoni J.P. Norberg C.L. Segel I.H. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda ). 1973; 52: 362-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Neurospora crassa (2Schloemer R. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 259-269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the presence of H+/nitrate symport activity was shown in the plasma membrane of cells of Candida utilis (3Eddy A.A. Hopkins P.G. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Emericella (Aspergillus) nidulans (4Downey R.J. Gedeon C.A. Microbios. 1994; 78: 35-46PubMed Google Scholar). In N. crassa, the nitrate transport system was induced by the external supply of NO3− and theKm was 0.25 mm, whereas the nitrite system had a Km of 86 μm (5Schloemer R. Garrett R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 270-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophysiological characterization of nitrate transport in intact hyphae of N. crassa showed that high affinity transport was sensitive to both membrane voltage and external pH (6Blatt M.R. Maurosset L. Meharg A.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nitrate uptake had complex kinetics in E. nidulans but theKm was estimated as 200 μm (7Brownlee A.G. Arst H.N. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 115: 1138-1146Crossref Google Scholar). The crnA mutants of E. nidulans were first isolated as a class of chlorate-resistant strains that were able to utilize nitrate as the sole nitrogen source (8Tomsett A.B. Cove D. Genet. Res. Camb. 1979; 34: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The crnAmutants were subsequently found to be defective in nitrate uptake at the conidiospore and young mycelial stages (7Brownlee A.G. Arst H.N. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 115: 1138-1146Crossref Google Scholar). The crnAgene has been cloned (9Unkles S. Hawker K.L. Grieve C. Campbell E.I. Kinghorn J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and belongs to the Major Facilitator superfamily of membrane transporters, being in the same family (nitrate-nitrite porter, NNP)1 as NarK, the nitrite efflux system from Escherichia coli and the NRT2 high affinity nitrate transporters from algae and higher plants (10Trueman L.J. Richardson A. Forde B.G. Gene (Amst. ). 1996; 175: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A related nitrate transporter from the yeast Hansenula polymorpha has also been isolated (11Perez M.D. Gonzalez C. Avila J. Brito N. Siverio J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Genes encoding high affinity nitrate transporters from the alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been isolated and complementation of mutant strains has shown that two genes (Nar2 and eitherNRT2;1 or NRT2;2) are necessary for a functional nitrate transport system (12Quesada A. Galván A. Fernández E. Plant J. 1994; 5: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In Chlamydomonas, nitrate and nitrite are transported by different specific transport systems and also by a bispecific transporter (13Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2088-2092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The injection of a mixture ofNar2 and Nrt2;1 mRNA into Xenopusoocytes gave nitrate transporter activity, but Nar2 mRNA was also toxic to these cells (14Zhou J.-J. Fernández E. Galván A. Miller A.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence for a mammalian H+/NO3− cotransport mechanism has also been described (15Chow C.-W. Kapus A. Romanek R. Grinstein S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To date there are no reports of the detailed characterization of high affinity nitrate transporters in a heterologous expression system, although members of the NRT1 family of low affinity transporters have been studied in Xenopus oocytes (16Tsay Y.-F. Schroeder J.I. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 705-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 17Zhou J.J. Theodoulou F.L Muldin I. Ingemarsson B. Miller A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12017-12023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As inChlamydomonas, a high affinity nitrate transport system requires two gene products; we tested if crnA, the first nitrate transporter gene to be isolated, encodes a fully functional uptake system. This is important because many homologs of the NNP family have recently been cloned by sequence homology tocrnA (18Forde B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), but the function of these cannot easily be demonstrated. The plant family members are of fundamental importance to plant biology and agriculture because nitrogen supply is the main factor limiting growth and yield of crops. Functional characterization of the NNPs is hindered by the lack of convenient tracers for the transported substrates. 13N-labeled nitrate and nitrite are not generally available, and 36Cl-labeled chlorate is not commercially produced or reliably produced. However, electrophysiological techniques can be used to assay for nitrate transport. Many plant and mammalian transporters have been successfully expressed and subsequently characterized in Xenopus oocytes, but there is only one report of a fungal membrane protein being expressed, the yeast α-factor receptor (19Yu L. Blumer K.J. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20847-20850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have been able to demonstrate and characterize the high affinity nitrate and nitrite proton cotransport activity of the CRNA protein expressed in oocytes. Unless otherwise stated, all standard molecular biology protocols were performed (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A full-length crnA cDNA clone was generated using a unique internal SphI site located near the middle of the coding region to join a 5′-fragment generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR with a 3′-fragment obtained from the partialcrnA cDNA clone pSTA1500 (9Unkles S. Hawker K.L. Grieve C. Campbell E.I. Kinghorn J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The cDNA template for reverse transcriptase-PCR was synthesized by reverse transcription of poly(A)+ RNA from nitrate-grown E. nidulans using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The PCR reaction was performed using PfuI polymerase (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instructions. The primers (5′-GTCGAGTTTGGATCCAACTTC-3′ and 5′-ACGGCCATGGAATTCACACCT-3′) were designed to amplify the cDNA sequence corresponding to nucleotides 1237–2929 of the genomic sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession no.M61125), and each contained one nucleotide substitution introduced to create a restriction site (BamHI and EcoRI, respectively) for cloning purposes. The PCR product was digested withBamHI and EcoRI and cloned into pYES2 (Invitrogen) to give pCRNA1. A clone containing the crnAsequence downstream of the SphI site was generated by subcloning the 1-kb SphI-XbaI fragment from pSTA1500 into pUC19 to generate pCRNA2. TheHindIII-SphI fragment from pCRNA1, containing thecrnA sequence upstream of the SphI site, was then transferred into the corresponding sites in pCRNA2 to give pCRNA5. The sequence of the resultant full-length crnA cDNA in pCRNA5 was determined using custom primers and a T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and comparison with the published genomiccrnA sequence (9Unkles S. Hawker K.L. Grieve C. Campbell E.I. Kinghorn J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) showed it to be correct. The sequence has been entered into the GenBank™/EBI database under the accession no. U34382. To obtain a version of the crnAcDNA clone suitable for in vitro transcription and oocyte expression, the insert from pCRNA5 was excised usingHindIII and XbaI and cloned into theHindIII and SpeI sites of pXE3 to give pCRNA-R1. The transcription vector pXE3 contains a 75-bp poly(A) tail cloned into the XbaI and NotI sites of pBluescript SK (Stratagene) and lacks a region of the polylinker from KpnI to HincII that might interfere with translation. 2L. J. Trueman and B. G. Forde, unpublished observations. After linearizing pCRNA-R1 by digestion at a unique NotI site immediately 3′ to the poly(A) tail, full-length crnAmRNA was synthesized using a T7 RNA transcription kit (Ambion). Purification of the mRNA and confirmation of its size and integrity by gel electrophoresis were performed according to protocols provided by the supplier of the in vitro transcription kit. Oocytes were prepared and treated as described previously (17Zhou J.J. Theodoulou F.L Muldin I. Ingemarsson B. Miller A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12017-12023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Healthy oocytes at stage V or VI (21Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar) were chosen for injection with 50 nl of crnA mRNA (1 ng/nl), or 50 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water as control. Injections were performed as described previously (17Zhou J.J. Theodoulou F.L Muldin I. Ingemarsson B. Miller A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12017-12023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and experiments were performed 4–7 days after injection. The anion-elicited currents were assayed in oocytes using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method and using the pCLAMP software 6.0 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) as described previously (17Zhou J.J. Theodoulou F.L Muldin I. Ingemarsson B. Miller A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12017-12023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). All electrophysiological measurements were made in a saline containing (in mm) 116 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.2. For experiments to vary external pH (pHo), between pH 7 and 8, HEPES was used but for the more acidic saline MES was added in place of HEPES. The pH was adjusted by the addition of 5 m NaOH solution. Experiments were performed in a 0.5-ml plexiglass chamber, which was perfused continuously with saline at a rate of 2 ml min−1 throughout the recording. Only oocytes that had resting potentials more negative than −30 mV in saline at pHo 7.2 were used for voltage-clamp experiments. For steady-state current measurements, the oocyte membrane potential was clamped at −50 mV. From this value the membrane was pulsed to a range of different test potentials for 120 ms from +10 to −180 mV with either 40 or 20 mV incremental steps, followed by a 1-s interpulse interval at the holding potential (VH). The membrane currents reached steady-state within 50 ms of clamping, and the mean values were calculated from the last 20 ms at each clamping voltage. The anion-elicited currents were used to obtain current-voltage difference curves (I-V) as described previously (17Zhou J.J. Theodoulou F.L Muldin I. Ingemarsson B. Miller A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12017-12023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Oocytes were treated with these anions for less than 1 min to minimize the accumulation of nitrate within the cell. As the transporter may have a very high affinity for nitrate, we measured the concentration of nitrate present in nitrite solutions using a standard assay method (22Sloane C.H. Sublett B.J. Tob. Sci. 1966; 10: 121-125Google Scholar). These measurements showed that nitrate was present at less than 1%, even in nitrite solutions that had been vigorously aerated for 1 h. In all experiments, the oocytes were allowed to adjust for at least 5 min after changing the external pH before any treatments were applied. At any given membrane potential, steady-state currents measured as a function of external substrate concentration were fit to single Michaelis-Menten functions (23Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 9-62Google Scholar) by a non-linear least squares method using Sigmaplot software (Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany). This function did not fit some of the data, and a more complicated model that could describe cis- or substrate-inhibition was required. In this model, the uptake of substrate (S) can be described as the sum of two apparently independent Michaelis-Menten processes, which can be written as Equation 1, is=[S] oimaxIKmI+[S] o+imaxIIKmII+[S] oEquation 1 where the superscripts I and II define the two phases, each of which is characterized by a saturating velocityimax and a Km. This type of analysis has been used to describe enzyme reactions that involve two substrates. To obtain the crnAmRNA necessary for oocyte expression studies, we needed a full-length crnA cDNA sequence in a suitable transcription vector. However, the only crnA cDNA clone available (pSTA1500, Ref. 9Unkles S. Hawker K.L. Grieve C. Campbell E.I. Kinghorn J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was incomplete at the 5′-end, whereas the cloned crnA gene (in pSTA4) was also unsuitable for our purposes because it contained three introns (9Unkles S. Hawker K.L. Grieve C. Campbell E.I. Kinghorn J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We therefore used RT-PCR to generate the missing 5′ part of the cDNA sequence and combined this with a segment of the pSTA1500 insert to create a full-length crnA cDNA clone, pCRNA5, which was then fully sequenced to establish its authenticity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because of an error in assigning the precise location of one of the introns, crnA was originally reported to encode a polypeptide of 483 amino acids with 10 transmembrane domains (9Unkles S. Hawker K.L. Grieve C. Campbell E.I. Kinghorn J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The crnA sequence in pCRNA5 was confirmed as encoding a polypeptide of 507 amino acids and 12 predicted transmembrane domains (see GenBank™/EBI accession no. U34382). Transporter activity in oocytes injected with the crnAmRNA was examined electrically using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Oocytes injected with mRNA for the truncated form of CRNA did not show any nitrate-elicited currents (data not shown). Fig. 1 A shows theI-V difference curves obtained for membrane voltages (Vm) between 0 and −160 mV for oocytes injected with full-length crnA mRNA. Subtracting theI-V relationship obtained in the absence of substrate from that obtained in its presence generated these curves. Both nitrate and nitrite (applied as the sodium salt at a concentration of 0.1 mm and at pHo 7) elicited currents in oocytes, which had been injected with crnA mRNA. These currents increased, as the membrane potential became more negative and showed saturation kinetics as the concentration increased. When nitrite and nitrate were supplied together at saturating concentrations, the currents did not increase, suggesting that the two anions bind to and are transported at the same site on the protein (data not shown). In initial experiments it was found that chlorate also elicited currents in the crnA-injected oocytes. However, when the chlorate solution was prepared a few minutes before the experiment, no current could be measured at any membrane voltage (Fig. 1 A). To test the possibility that some of the chlorate was being converted to chlorite during storage of the solution and that it was actually chlorite that was being transported, we treated an oocyte expressing CRNA with a freshly prepared solution of sodium chlorite. This treatment elicited current similar to that obtained with NO3−, confirming that ClO2− was being transported (data not shown). No significant currents were obtained when crnA-injected oocytes were treated with similar concentrations of several other possible substrates, including bicarbonate, sulfate, cyanate, histidine, and the dipeptide His-Leu (data not shown). The ability of CRNA to transport Cl− was also tested, by replacing the Cl− in the bathing solution with gluconate whereas leaving the cation concentration unchanged. Nitrate, but not Cl−, could evoke currents in crnA-injected oocytes in this modified saline, showing that CRNA was unable to transport chloride. Water-injected control oocytes showed no significant current when treated with any of these ions at the same concentration. Replacing the bathing saline with a solution in which the sodium was replaced with choline tested the sodium-dependence of the NO3−-elicited current. The magnitude of the nitrate-elicited currents in a crnA-injected oocyte in each saline were then measured and compared. The experiment showed that the currents were not significantly different and so indicate no role for Na+ in NO3− transport by CRNA. Fig. 1 B shows an experiment where pHo was 7 and the NO3− concentration was varied from 1 to 200 μm to generate a family of I-V curves. The steady-state currents were measured as a function of voltage for each NO3− concentration. These nitrate-elicited currents became larger at more negative membrane potentials and appeared to saturate at an external NO3−concentration between 40 and 60 μm. Fig. 2 A shows the relationship between the nitrate transport activity of CRNA and the external NO3− concentration from 1 to 150 μm at pHo 7 for seven different membrane voltages. These results confirmed that CRNA was a high affinity NO3− transporter, with the transport activity saturating around 40 μm, but the data only fit a Michaelis-Menten function at the lower membrane voltages. A similar pattern was observed for the other anion substrates, and an example for ClO2− but with no fitted line is shown in Fig. 2 B. Steady-state NO3−-elicited currents were measured as a function of voltage and pHo. At a fixed external NO3− concentration (200 μm) and at any given voltage the data from the I-V difference curve fit a single Michaelis-Menten function (Fig. 3 A). Fig. 3 B shows the voltage-independence of the KmH values calculated from these fits. The values for KmH were also voltage-dependent, changing from 0.14 μm(pH 6.85) at 0 mV to 0.004 μm (pH 8.4) at −180 mV (Fig. 3 B). The imaxH values also obtained from these lines were voltage-dependent, increasing from −26 nA at 0 mV to −63 nA at −180 mV (data not shown). When an oocyte expressing CRNA was treated with nitrate concentrations from 1 μm to 20 mm and the concentration was plotted on a log scale, the substrate inhibition becomes very clear (Fig. 4). At more negative voltages and at NO3− concentrations larger than 80 μm, the current mediated by the transporter decreased, showing an inhibition of transport activity by NO3−. For example, at −150 mV the current in 20 mm NO3− is decreased by 50% when compared with that obtained at 100 μmNO3−. Whereas the equivalent percentage inhibition at −70 mV is 20%, and at −30 mV, there was no inhibition by higher concentrations of nitrate. The data shown in Fig. 4 could be described by a more complicated model that included two additive Michaelis-Menten functions (24Sanders D. J. Memb. Biol. 1986; 90: 67-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). From fits of this model to these data points the Km and imax values for each function (I and II) could be determined at each membrane voltage (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mean value of KmI NO3 was 20.5 μm and was independent of changes in membrane voltage in the range from −160 to −70 mV, whereas at less negative membrane voltages, KmI NO3 increased to 88 μm at −30 mV. The voltage-dependence of the KmIand KmII values was also determined for two other substrates, NO2− and ClO2−. The kinetic parameters were calculated from fits to families of different NO2− and ClO2− concentrations at pHo 7. For both substrates, the parameters imaxNO2 and imaxClO2 were voltage-dependent, increasing as the membrane potential became more negative, whereas in contrast, both KmClO2 and KmNO2 were voltage-independent (data not shown). When compared with nitrate, the values of KmI were 3- and 4-fold higher for NO2− and ClO2− respectively. The effect of changing pHo on the nitrate-elicited currents was measured in oocytes injected with crnA mRNA. The nitrate-elicited currents increased as the pHo was decreased from 8 to 6, but at pHo 5.5 this effect saturated showing no further increase in current (Fig. 3 A). At pHo 5.5, when the mRNA-injected oocyte was treated with a range of nitrate concentrations, the substrate-inhibition of current was again demonstrated (Fig. 5 A). To compare the results obtained at different pHo, the nitrate-elicited currents were normalized to the maximal current obtained and this is shown as the percentage substrate inhibition (Fig. 5 B). Fig. 5 B shows a comparison of the percentage nitrate inhibition at pHo 5.5 and 7. The substrate inhibition of current was not effected by a change in pHo from 7 to 5.5, and similar profiles were obtained at intermediate pHo values (data not shown). Three fundamental observations define the anion-inhibition of CRNA activity. 1) It increases with higher concentrations of anion substrate. 2) It is independent of changes in external pH (over the range 8 to 5.5), and 3) it is voltage dependent, increasing at more negative voltages. This information can be used to build a reaction cycle model of CRNA-mediated transport. A decrease in the inward current can occur by three possible mechanisms, a change in the amount of available carrier in the membrane, a decrease in the influx of protons or an increase in anion influx. There are other options that involve changes in efflux (decreased for protons and increased for anions), but these can be discounted because they are thermodynamically unfeasible. The practicability of each of these three mechanisms will be considered. As the substrate-inhibition of CRNA does not depend on pHo, but increases with the inwardly directed chemical gradient for anions, the most likely mechanism to achieve this result is an increased anion influx. The only mechanism that can account for both of these observations is that nitrate must bind before protons, and some transfer of the anion across the membrane can occur in this form (see Fig. 6). There are usually two recognized steps at which the transmembrane charge transfer can occur. These are the translocation of either the loaded carrier (positive charge) or the unloaded carrier (negative charge). A model involving the binding and translocation of nitrate via a negatively charged empty carrier is thermodynamically unlikely. Particularly, as the substrate-inhibition is voltage-dependent increasing at more negative membrane voltages. The charged form of the carrier should be the loaded form with all three ions, two protons and one nitrate ion, bound for translocation. At high external concentrations of nitrate, the anion binds first and before the proton binding. Some translocation across the membrane occurs driven by the chemical gradient of nitrate (Fig. 6,dashed line). In other words, nitrate binding to CRNA happens before the proton binding and nitrate slippage through the carrier only occurs at high external concentrations. This step will be independent of the proton gradient because the membrane translocation of nitrate does not require a proton. Although the negative membrane voltage will tend to oppose nitrate translocation into the oocyte, there is a large chemical gradient driving nitrate transport. The nitrate slippage increases at more negative membrane voltages because the proton-coupled charge translocation step increases at more negative voltage providing more unloaded carrier for this process to occur. In support of this aspect of the model the substrate inhibition, relative to the maximal current, increases at more negative voltages; for example, 50% nitrate inhibition at −150 mV and 20% at −70 mV (see Fig. 3). The NO3− transporter CRNA of E. nidulans has been heterologously expressed in Xenopusoocytes enabling the first electrophysiological characterization of a fungal carrier protein using this expression system. Although there have been in vivo electrophysiological studies on high affinity nitrate transport activity in Neurospora (6Blatt M.R. Maurosset L. Meharg A.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), these measurements could not exclude the possibility that the nitrate transport processes being analyzed were mediated by more than one protein. Oocytes injected with mRNA for a truncated form of the protein did not show any nitrate-elicited currents. These results suggest that this deletion altered the transport activity or the membrane targeting of the protein. In the green algae Chlamydomonas, genetic analysis has established that the NRT2;1 and NRT2;2 genes, which are homologous to crnA and which encode the membrane proteins responsible for high affinity nitrate and nitrite transport in this organism, require the activity of an additional gene (Nar2) to specify functional transport systems (12Quesada A. Galván A. Fernández E. Plant J. 1994; 5: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 13Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2088-2092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments confirmed that the ChlamydomonasNRT2;1 transporter is not functional when expressed in oocytes, and nitrate transport activity was only measured after co-injection ofNar2 mRNA (14Zhou J.-J. Fernández E. Galván A. Miller A.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Possible roles for Nar2 include acting as a second subunit for the NRT2 transporter or an involvement in trafficking of the NRT2 protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. In the oocyte experiments reported here, functional high affinity NO3− transport was achieved with a single protein. The ability to obtain functional expression ofcrnA in oocytes without the assistance of a second gene suggests that there may be important differences between the algal and the fungal nitrate transporters, despite the sequence homology between the crnA and NRT2 genes. One striking distinction between the predicted structures of the fungal and the algal nitrate transporters of this family is in the arrangement of the hydrophilic domains within the primary sequence of the proteins. The fungal proteins lack a large C-terminal domain that is found in the algal (and higher plant) NRT2 proteins and instead have a large central loop between transmembrane domains 6 and 7 (10Trueman L.J. Richardson A. Forde B.G. Gene (Amst. ). 1996; 175: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Forde B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The CRNA transporter expressed in oocytes can also transport nitrite and chlorite, but with a lower affinity than nitrate. TheKm for NO3− of the carrier expressed in oocytes was less than the value obtained for E. nidulans cells in vivo, for example 200 μm (7Brownlee A.G. Arst H.N. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 115: 1138-1146Crossref Google Scholar). As CRNA has a high affinity for NO3−, the nitrite-elicited current could have resulted from contamination of the NO2− solution with nitrate. To check for this possibility we measured how much nitrate could be present in a solution of nitrite and attempted to favor this oxidation reaction by vigorously aerating a nitrite solution. Even after vigorous aeration for 1 h, less than 1% of the nitrite had been converted to nitrate. To explain the apparent differences in KmNO2 and KmNO3 would require 15% nitrate contamination in the nitrite solutions, a figure that is larger than we could measure. This result shows that, like one of the nitrate transport systems in Chlamydomonas (13Galván A. Quesada A. Fernández E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2088-2092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), CRNA can also transport nitrite. Although a specific transporter for nitrite has not been demonstrated in E. nidulans, the identification of mutations resulting in hypersensitivity to nitrite implies that it may exist (8Tomsett A.B. Cove D. Genet. Res. Camb. 1979; 34: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 25Pombeiro S.R.C. Martinez-Rossi N.M. Rossi A. Genet. Res. 1983; 41: 203-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 26Pombeiro S.R.C. Rossi A. Martinez-Rossi N.M. World J. MicroBiol. Biotechnol. 1992; 8: 477-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The original crnA mutation was selected by growth on chlorate-containing medium at mmconcentrations (7Brownlee A.G. Arst H.N. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 115: 1138-1146Crossref Google Scholar), but results reported here show that the selection was actually for ClO2− resistance (Fig. 2 B). The presence of μm contaminating concentrations of chlorite in the original chlorate solutions leading to isolation of crnA. The activity of CRNA in oocytes was strongly dependent on the membrane potential, both in providing a direct energy source for transport (with current increasing, as membrane voltage became more negative) but also in changing some of the kinetic properties of the carrier. It was found that KmH but not KmNO3 was voltage-dependent. One of the main features previously described for in vivo high affinity nitrate transport, both in Neurospora and in plants (6Blatt M.R. Maurosset L. Meharg A.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Meharg A.A. Blatt M.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 145: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), was the voltage-dependence of the transport system. To demonstrate this voltage-dependence in vivo, it was necessary to clamp the membrane voltage at values more negative than −200 mV. However this was not possible in the oocyte experiments because at values more negative than −180 mV there was activation of an endogenous chloride channel in the oocyte plasma membrane (28Parker I. Miledi R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1988; 233: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which then dominated theI-V curve making it difficult to determine the carrier current. Nonetheless, it has been possible to demonstrate the voltage sensitivity of plant carriers expressed in Xenopus oocytes (16Tsay Y.-F. Schroeder J.I. Feldmann K.A. Crawford N.M. Cell. 1993; 72: 705-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 29Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 159: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this work and for AtSUC1 the Arabidopsissucrose transporter (30Zhou J.J. Theodoulou F.L Sauer N. Sanders D. Miller A.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) there was a similar 1.8-fold increase in the current as membrane voltage was increased from −50 to −150 mV. In contrast, there was almost no voltage-sensitivity of the nitrate cotransport in this range of membrane voltage forNeurospora; only at voltages more negative than −150 mV did the voltage-sensitivity become obvious (6Blatt M.R. Maurosset L. Meharg A.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsisroot hair cells over the same range of membrane voltages (-50 to −150 mV) the nitrate-elicited current increased by 1.8-fold; only at more negative voltages did the effect of membrane voltage become even larger (27Meharg A.A. Blatt M.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 145: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These measurements show that the membrane potential has an important role in regulating CRNA activity, and so any environmental changes that influence this parameter will have effects on nitrate transport. This model for the reaction cycle of CRNA (Fig. 6) must be very sensitive to the concentration gradient of anion substrate (nitrate) across the plasma membrane. In the oocyte experiments, the cells were previously incubated in a solution containing no nitrate, and the exposure times to nitrate were deliberately minimized. Increasing cytoplasmic concentrations of nitrate can test the model, because the predicted response should be a decrease in the substrate inhibition. There is indirect evidence for this model because the point at which the onset of the substrate inhibition occurs varies slightly from oocyte to oocyte (compare Figs. 2 A, 4, and 5,A–B). This would be consistent with differing internal concentrations of nitrate in each of these oocytes. To test this model, the pattern of anion-substrate inhibition of CRNA transporter activity should be compared for an oocyte that was preincubated in zero nitrate solution and then transferred to nitrate-containing saline. This type of experiment is technically difficult to perform because associated with the nitrate accumulation in the oocyte, there is an acidification of the cytosol that complicates the interpretation of the experiment. The kinetic model developed here to describe the substrate inhibition has important physiological consequences for the activity of the high affinity nitrate uptake system. The substrate inhibition of CRNA was assayed as a decrease in the measured current, but the actual flux of anions was not determined. When the cytosolic pool of nitrate is depleted, the concentration gradient alone can drive uptake into the cell. In contrast to plants (31Van der Leij M. Smith S.J. Miller A.J. Planta (Heidelb.). 1998; 205: 64-72Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar), fungi have small vacuolar stores of nitrate to maintain the cytosolic nitrate pools, so the concentration may be depleted more readily. An evolutionary advantage is provided by a nitrate uptake system that requires less energy input by the cell. For example, when a sudden flush of nitrate supply occurs in the environment, there can be a large increase in the external nitrate concentrations. This transport mechanism proves an energetic advantage to the fungus by uncoupling the proton gradient from nitrate uptake. Nitrate influx is driven by the concentration gradient minimizing the requirement for the more energetically expensive coupling to proton fluxes, and yet the same protein can mediate uptake by cotransport at very low external nitrate concentrations. It remains to be seen if these two transport mechanims are general features of the NNP family or are only found in the fungal members (type II) that are defined by having a large hydrophilic central loop (18Forde B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a single protein can function as a high affinity nitrate transport system although the carrier has two different mechanisms for achieving nitrate membrane translocation into the cell.

In addition, internally translated isoforms of Sp3 function as potent inhibitors of Sp1-mediated transcription in vivo since such truncated isoforms lack substantial portions of the Sp3 transactivation domain (6Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Thus, the balance between Sp1 and Sp3 is an important regulator of target genes (7Hata Y. Duh E. Zhang K. Robinson G.S. Aiello L.P. J. Biol.

The murine zinc finger protein of the cerebellum (Zic) was cloned through a search for proteins involved in cerebellar development (8Aruga J. Yokota N. Hashimoto M. Furuichi T. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1880-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Zic2 and Zic3 were cloned as members of the Zic gene family (9Aruga J. Nagai T. Tokuyama T. Hayashizaki Y.

Zicexpression is highly restricted to the cerebellar granule cell lineage and in medulloblastoma cells (10Yokota N. Aruga J. Takai S. Yamada K. Hamazaki M. Iwase T. Sugimura H. Mikoshiba K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 377-383PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, analysis ofZic knock-out mice confirms that this transcription factor is involved in cerebellar development (11Aruga J. Minowa O. Yaginuma H. Kuno J. Nagai T. Noda T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 284-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutations in Zic2 have been associated with holoprosencephaly (12Brown S.A. Warburton D. Brown L.Y., Yu, C.Y. Roeder E.R. Stengel-Rutkowski S. Hennekam R.C. Muenke M. Nat.

Central dopaminergic effects are mediated by cell-surface receptors expressed in dopaminoceptive cells that are found mainly in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. Dopamine receptors are a family of G protein-coupled receptors and are classified into two subtypes as follows: D1-like (D1A and D5 or D1B) and D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) receptors based on their sequence homology and pharmacological criteria (21Dearry A.

Both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the human brain have been found to decrease with aging, a finding that may relate to the decline in motor performance with advancing age (23Wang Y. Chan G.L. Holden J.E. Dobko T. Mak E. Schulzer M. Huser J.M. Snow B.J. Ruth T.J. Calne D.B. Stoessl A.J. Synapse. 1998; 30: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Morris E.D. Chefer S.I.

Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We had previously found that the human D1A receptor gene is transcribed in the brain from two promoters (25Lee S.H. Minowa M.T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25292-25299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A cis-acting element located between nucleotides −1154 and −1136 relative to the translation start site (termed activator region 1, AR1)1 mediates transactivation of the upstream promoter in neuronal cells (25Lee S.H. Minowa M.T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25292-25299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although AR1 has a consensus sequence for AP2-binding site, a significant role for this factor in regulating D1Agene transcription has been excluded based on lack of functional AP2 in the striatum or in the D1A-expressing NS20Y cell line (26Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present investigation employing the yeast one-hybrid screening method, we identified three transcription factors that interact with the AR1 sequence and regulate the humanD1A gene promoter. The MATCHMAKER One-hybrid System (CLONTECH) was used according to the supplier's protocol. Three tandem repeats of the −1154 to −1136 bp sequence (AR1) from the human D1A gene were ligated into pHISi and pLacZ to generate pHISi-AR1 and pLacZ-AR1, respectively. These two bait constructs were then linearized with XhoI andNcoI, respectively, and integrated into the genome of YM4271 yeast strain. The resultant yeast cells with the integrated pHISi-AR1 were tested for growth on a medium lacking histidine (His−) in the presence of increasing concentrations of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). Background growth was inhibited at 30 mm 3-AT, and this concentration was then used when yeast cells were transformed with a human brain cDNA library for one-hybrid screening. Seven positive transformants grown on His− plates were selected. To exclude false positive clones, plasmids recovered from these seven clones were used to transform yeast cells harboring the pLacZ-AR1 construct. Positive transformants grown on His− and leucine-negative (Leu−) medium containing 30 mm 3-AT were streaked onto a nylon filter and incubated by placing the filter on the same medium at 30 °C for 2 days. The filter was then soaked in liquid nitrogen for 10 s and placed on a Whatman 3MM filter, which had been presoaked in Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 60 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0), containing 0.01% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Plasmids from 15 positive blue clones were sequenced, and their homology was analyzed using the BLAST algorithm. TheZic2 cDNA isolated from the yeast one-hybrid screening was sequenced using Applied Biosystems ABI 740 sequencer and cloned into pGEM-3Zf(−) (Promega), yielding pGEM-pZic2. Since this clone lacked the adenosine of the first ATG codon, full-lengthZic2 cDNA was generated using adapter oligonucleotides containing the consensus Kozac sequence from murine Zic2(9Aruga J. Nagai T. Tokuyama T. Hayashizaki Y. Okazaki Y. Chapman V.M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1043-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These adapter sequences were as follows: upper strand, 5′-AATTCCTGGCCATGCTCCTGGACGCGGGTCCGCAGTTCCCGGCCATCGGG-3′; lower strand, 5′-ATGGCCGGGAACTGCGGACCCGCGTCCAGGAGCATGGCCAGG-3′. The annealed adapter was ligated into pGEM-pZic2 that had been digested with EcoRI and BstXI. The resultant plasmid was designated pGEM-fZic2. Full-length Zic2 was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) yielding pcDNA-Zic2. In vitro transcription/translation (Life Technologies, Inc.) was carried out with pcDNA-Zic2 in a reaction mixture containing [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The labeled protein was then electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE to determine its size. The murine neuroblastoma cell line NS20Y was a kind gift from Dr. Marshall Nirenberg (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. The human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 (ATCC) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Insect SL2 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen) in ambient air. AR1 probe was synthesized using an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer (AR1, upper strand, 5′-AGGACCGCCCCCAGGGCAGGGGA-3′; lower strand, 5′-TCCCCTGCCCTGGGGGCGGTCCT-3′). The upper strand was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with the cold lower strand. Double-stranded, end-labeled DNA probe (20,000 cpm/binding reaction; 5 fmol) was incubated with 2 μl of in vitrotranslated Zic2 protein or control lysate or with NS20Y nuclear extract in a final volume of 20 μl at room temperature for 30 min. In some experiments, polyclonal antibodies to Sp1, Sp3, and AP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or purified Sp1 (Promega) were coincubated with NS20Y nuclear extract for 30 min at room temperature prior to adding the probe. In order to remove Sp1 binding activity, NS20Y nuclear extract was frozen at −70 °C and thawed fully by rubbing the tube by hand. This freeze/thaw cycle was repeated 10 times. The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in 4% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel in 1× Tris glycine buffer as described previously (26Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking between transcription factors and chromatin was achieved in NS20Y cells by adding formaldehyde (final concentration 1%) to the culture medium for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding glycine at a final concentration of 0.125 m, and the cells were washed three times with cold PBS. Cells were then scraped in PBS, centrifuged, and washed once with PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of cell lysis buffer (5 mm Pipes (KOH), pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) in the presence of protease inhibitors (100 ng/ml leupeptin, 100 ng/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and subjected to 10 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 250 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml of nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS plus the protease inhibitors), and the samples were sonicated at full power for five 10-s pulses to cut the chromatin to an average length of below 2 kb. Samples were then diluted 10-fold with the immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 8, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl plus the protease inhibitors). To reduce nonspecific binding, samples were incubated with 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotating wheel, and beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min. Precleared chromatin solutions were incubated with antibody to Sp1 (10 μg) or to Sp3 (10 μg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with no antibody and rotated at 4 °C for 12 h. Immune complexes were collected by adding 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 4 h with rotation. Samples were subsequently washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA) and eluted by three successive 5-min incubations with 150 μl of elution buffer (1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm NaHCO3). The eluates were pooled, and NaCl was added at a final concentration of 0.3 m, and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the formaldehyde-induced cross-linking. Digestion buffer was added (10 μl of 2 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 2 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml)), and the samples were placed at 45 °C for 2 h. Chromatin DNA was extracted with phenol/CHCl3 followed by ethanol precipitation. DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of sterile H2O, and 5 μl was used in PCR analysis. Primers for amplifying the 152-bp fragment encompassing the AR1 region of theD1A receptor promoter were designed as follows: 5D1ch (5′-CGCAACTCTGCCTGTCAAG-3′) and 3D1ch (5′-CTCTCAGGAGCCTGTGGC-3′). Following 30 cycles of amplification, PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Transfection of SL2 cells was carried out using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) with HyQ-CCM 3 serum-free medium (HyClone Laboratories) in 60-mm dishes. Two μg of pCATD1-1154 (26Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 1 μg of pRmSp1, pRmSp3 (5Yajima S. Lee S.H. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), or both were used. After 16 h incubation, Sp1 or Sp3 expression was induced with 0.7 mm CuSO4, and the cells were harvested 24 h after induction and lysed. CAT protein was quantified by the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. For Sp1 and Sp3 activity assays in NS20Y, plasmids expressing these factors from the cytomegalovirus promoter were constructed. pcDNASp1 and pcDNASp3 were generated by ligating theEcoRI-SalI fragment of pRmSp1 and pRmSp3 (5Yajima S. Lee S.H. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), respectively, with EcoRI-XhoI-digested pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Transfection of NS20Y cells was carried out by the standard calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105cells per 35-mm dish (Fig. 4 B) or 1 × 106cells per 100-mm dish (Fig. 7 A) and cultured overnight before transfection. After a 6-h transfection period, cells were incubated in fresh medium for an additional 48 h. CAT protein was quantified by the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate.Figure 7Zic2 inhibits transcriptional activity of Sp1 by blocking its binding to target DNA. A, NS20Y cells were cotransfected with pCATD1-1154 or pCATD1-1102 in the presence or absence of the expression vector pcDNA-Zic2. Five μg of each plasmid was used. Zic2 completely suppressed the transcriptional activity of pCATD1-1154 but not that of pCATD1-1102. Data shown are means ± S.E. for triplicate samples. *, p < 0.0006 compared with no Zic2. B, Zic2 suppresses endogenousD1A gene expression. NS20Y cells were transfected with pcDNA-Zic2 or control vector, and total RNA was prepared 48 h later for D1A Northern analysis.C, Zic2 competes with Sp1 and Sp3 binding to AR1. Three μg of NS20Y nuclear extract was incubated with 2 μl of in vitro translated Zic2 or control lysate and subjected to gel shift assay. Lanes 6–8 represent longer exposure of lanes 3–5, respectively. The Zic2 band appeared after long exposure (lane 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Human multiple tissue and brain region blots (CLONTECH) were used, and total RNA from NS20Y cells was prepared using RNAzol B (TEL-TEST, Inc.), electrophoresed in a 3% formaldehyde gel, and transferred onto a nylon membrane using turbo blotter (Schleicher & Schuell).32P-Labeled cDNA probes were prepared from inserts in pcDNA-Zic2, pGEM-mD1A (mouse D1AcDNA bases −584 to −272 relative to the first ATG codon (27Lee S.-H. Yajima S. Mouradian M.M. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 34: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar)), and from β-actin (CLONTECH) using a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used in sequential hybridizations. After each hybridization, the membrane was washed with 0.1× SSC, 0.05% SDS at 50 °C and exposed to x-ray film for 18 h at −80 °C with intensifying screen. The membrane was stripped thoroughly between hybridizations by boiling in 0.01% SDS for 5 min. The yeast one-hybrid screen was performed to find transcriptional regulators that bind to the AR1 region (Fig. 1) of the humanD1A dopamine receptor promoter. A double-stranded oligonucleotide having three tandem repeats of the AR1 sequence was subcloned into pHISi and introduced into yeast cells. The resultant strain was transformed with a human brain cDNA library. Plasmids prepared from clones grown on the selection medium were transformed into yeast strain containing pLacZ-AR1. Plasmids from 15 blue clones selected from the β-galactosidase assay were sequenced. These included Sp3, Zic2,AP2α, and AP2β.Although AR1 has an Sp1 consensus sequence (Fig. 1), the yeast one-hybrid screen did not isolate an Sp1 clone. The results obtained in yeast cells prompted us to investigate the nature of transcription factors that bind to the AR1 sequence in theD1A-expressing NS20Y neuroblastoma cells. Gel mobility shift analysis using nuclear extract from these cells revealed four major bands shifted with the AR1 probe (Fig. 2 A). Because of the presence of Sp1 and AP2 consensus sequences in AR1 and because Sp3 was one of the clones isolated from the yeast one-hybrid screen using AR1 as bait, we first sought to determine if these general transcription factors bind to AR1. Antibodies to the respective factors were used in gel supershift assays. Preincubation with an AP2 antibody did not affect any of the bands retarded by NS20Y nuclear extract (Fig. 2 A), although purified AP2 alone shifted the AR1 probe (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that NS20Y cells do not have functional AP2 capable of binding to AR1, consistent with our previous observation (26Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm this fact, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was carried out with RNA from NS20Y and THP-1 cells using AP2 primer pairs. An AP2-specific band was amplified in THP-1 cells but not in NS20Y cells (data not shown). In contrast to the ineffectiveness of the AP2 antibody, an Sp1 antibody supershifted band I, and an Sp3 antibody abrogated bands II–IV. Thus, Sp3 was identified as an AR1 binding factor both by yeast one-hybrid screening and by gel supershift assay. Although Sp1 found in NS20Y cells could bind to AR1 (Fig. 2 A), purified Sp1 alone failed to retard the AR1 probe (Fig. 2 B), and the yeast one-hybrid screen did not isolate an Sp1 clone. The latter observations raised the possibility that Sp1 might require a cofactor(s) to bind to the AR1 sequence. To address this hypothesis, NS20Y nuclear extract was subjected to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing to remove endogenous Sp1 binding activity and then spiked with purified Sp1. Whereas non-spiked freeze/thawed extract showed very weak binding to the AR1 probe (Fig. 2 C, lane 1), compared with the strong binding of non-manipulated extract (Fig. 2A, lane 1), purified Sp1 in the presence of nuclear extract shifted the probe, and this band was supershifted with an anti-Sp1 antibody. These data indicate that Sp1 requires a cofactor(s) present in NS20Y nuclei, and not affected by freeze/thaw cycles, to bind to the AR1 sequence. The ability of Sp1 and Sp3 to bind specifically to the AR1 region of the D1A promoter in vivo was evaluated using the chromatin immunoprecipitation method. NS20Y cells were treated with formaldehyde to induce cross-linking between transcription factors and chromatin. Prior to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Sp1 or Sp3, cross-linked chromatin was sonicated to an average length of below 2 kb (Fig. 3 A). Subsequently, successful immunoprecipitation of Sp1 and Sp3 was confirmed by Western blot analysis using the same respective antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Immunoprecipitated DNA-protein complexes were then dissociated, and DNA was amplified by PCR using primers specific for the AR1 sequence. The correct size band was amplified from DNA precipitated by Sp1 or Sp3 antibody but not from a similarly handled sample in the absence of antibody (Fig. 3 C). These observations confirmed that Sp1 and Sp3 interact with the AR1 sequence in vivo in NS20Y cells. To test the functional activity of Sp1 and Sp3 on the D1Apromoter, transient cotransfection assays were performed. Schneider'sDrosophila SL2 cells were chosen first because they do not express Sp family proteins to allow interpretation of quantitative results (28Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 29Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for Sp1 and Sp3 were used along with pCATD1-1154 reporter plasmid which includes the AR1 sequence and the D1A core promoter (26Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 indeed increased CAT gene expression from pCATD1-1154, whereas Sp3 suppressed Sp1-induced transactivation (Fig. 4 A) indicating that Sp1 functions as an activator of theD1A promoter, whereas Sp3 functions as a repressor. The transcriptional activity of Sp1 and Sp3 was also tested in the D1A receptor expressing NS20Y cells (Fig. 4 B), and the results obtained were consistent with our observations in SL2 cells. Sp1 alone activated the D1A promoter in pCATD1-1154 by about 2-fold, similar in magnitude to the induction of the apolipoprotein AI promoter by Sp1 in HepG2 cells (30Zheng X.L. Matsubara S. Diao C. Hollenberg M.D. Wong N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31747-31754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Sp3 alone was ineffective on the D1A promoter in NS20Y cells, but the combination of both factors neutralized this promoter. Thus, the presence of Sp3 inhibited the activity of Sp1. One of the clones isolated from the yeast one-hybrid screen was Zic2. Full-length humanZic2 cDNA was generated and the entire 2.6 kb sequenced (GenBankTM accession number AF193855). HumanZic2 encodes a 532-amino acid polypeptide, compared with 530 amino acids in murine Zic2. The homology in the zinc finger domains of human and murine Zic2 is 100%, but their C-terminal regions (253–415 amino acids) are only 59% identical. Comparison among murine Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3 sequences revealed that the region with the least homology is C-terminal to the zinc finger domain suggesting that this less conserved sequence could be important for the functional differentiation among Zic family proteins. To identify the major tissues that express Zic2, Northern hybridization was done with a multiple tissue blot. The only tissue with detectable Zic2 mRNA was the brain (Fig. 5 A), suggesting a unique role for this protein. Within the brain, Zic2 is expressed as two bands of approximately 3.2 and 3.5 kb predominantly in the cerebellum and as very faint bands in other regions but not in caudate, putamen, or substantia nigra (Fig. 5 B). Zic2 was isolated from the yeast one-hybrid screen by virtue of its ability to interact with the AR1 sequence. To confirm whether Zic2 can bind to this sequence, gel mobility shift assay was carried out using in vitrotranslated Zic2. Protein electrophoresis revealed that Zic2 migrates slower than expected from its calculated molecular weight likely due to the abundance of prolines (Fig. 6 A). In gel retardation experiments, Zic2 was able to shift the target AR1 probe, and cold AR1 oligonucleotide competed off the Zic2-DNA complex (Fig. 6 B) indicating that Zic2 can specifically bind to the AR1 sequence. The transcriptional activity of Zic2 on theD1A gene was tested in NS20Y cells, which have no detectable endogenous Zic2 mRNA by Northern analysis (data not shown). Cotransfection with a mammalian Zic2expression construct along with pCATD1-1154 or pCATD1-1102 (26Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out. Since the AR1 region is an important activator of theD1A promoter, Zic2 was expected to enhance the activity of pCATD1-1154. Surprisingly, Zic2 markedly suppressed transcription of pCATD1-1154. No effect was found on pCATD1-1102 that lacks the AR1 region (Fig. 7 A) indicating specificity of the Zic2 effect through the AR1 sequence. The physiological significance of Zic2-mediated inhibition of pCATD1-1154 transcription was addressed next by investigating changes in endogenous D1A mRNA levels in NS20Y cells. Total RNA was prepared from cells transfected with pcDNA-Zic2 or with control vector (pcDNA3.1), and Northern analysis was performed with a D1A probe. Zic2 protein significantly decreased endogenous D1A message levels compared with control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 7 B) consistent with its effects on pCATD1-1154 (Fig. 7 A). The inhibitory effect of Zic2 on D1A gene transcription prompted us to investigate if Zic2 suppresses the binding of other proteins to the AR1 sequence. Nuclear extract from NS20Y cells was incubated with in vitro translated Zic2 or control reticulocyte lysate. Zic2 efficiently blocked Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the AR1 probe (Fig. 7 C, lane 3), whereas control lysate did not (Fig. 7 C, lane 2). Long exposure of the gel revealed that Zic2 binding to AR1 displaces Sp1 and Sp3 binding to DNA (Fig. 7 C, lanes 6–8). The present investigation employing several different approaches indicated that the human D1A dopamine receptor gene is regulated by Sp1, Sp3, and by Zic2 through their interaction with the activator AR1 sequence. The yeast one-hybrid screening with the AR1 sequence as bait isolated Sp3, Zic2, AP2α, and AP2β. Among these factors, AP2 family members were ruled out to play a functional role in D1A gene regulation, based on lack of specific AP2 binding activity in the striatum or in the D1A-expressing NS20Y cell line (26Minowa M.T. Minowa T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23544-23551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and based on absent AP2 mRNA in these cells. Although AR1 has a consensus sequence for Sp1 binding, Sp1 was not cloned from this screen. Furthermore, purified Sp1 could not bind to the AR1 sequence in gel mobility shift assays despite the fact that Sp1 expressed in NS20Y nuclear extract does. These observations taken together suggest that Sp1 might require another factor(s) expressed in NS20Y cells to bind to AR1. Such a requirement could explain the inability of the yeast one-hybrid screen to detect Sp1. This possibility was confirmed by coincubating purified Sp1 with NS20Y nuclear extract that had been stripped of its endogenous Sp1 and demonstrating specific binding of exogenous Sp1 to the AR1 sequence. Alternatively, modification of Sp1 by a factor(s) present in NS20Y nuclear extract was entertained since phosphorylation by the protein kinase A pathway has been reported to enhance the interaction of Sp1 with target DNA (31Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F. Lei J. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21137-21141Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, the DNA binding activity of purified Sp1 to the AR1 sequence was not improved in the presence of 40 units of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (Promega) (data not shown). Post-translational modifications not involving protein kinase A cannot be excluded, and the nature of cofactor(s) required for Sp1 binding to AR1 remains to be investigated. Although Sp1 is a ubiquitously expressed general transcription activator, considerable evidence indicates that Sp1 participates in cell type-specific gene expression as well (32D'Angelo D.D.

Sp3, on the other hand, can function either as an activator or repressor depending on promoter context (34Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G.S. Stein J.L.

DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and our present results indicate that Sp1 activatesD1A gene transcription, whereas Sp3 represses this Sp1 effect. Thus, the ratio between Sp1 and Sp3 appears to be a regulatory mechanism by which the general activity of Sp1 is modulated in specific cells. A similar scenario has also been described for a number of other promoters (7Hata Y. Duh E. Zhang K. Robinson G.S. Aiello L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19294-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 29Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 847-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although Sp3 can directly compete with Sp1 for the same DNA-binding site, it also appears to contain a functional repressor domain (36Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 39Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In addition, Sp3 isoforms translated from internal start codons result in smaller molecules that readily bind to GC boxes but lack the transactivation domain and, therefore, are potent suppressors of Sp1-mediated promoter activity (6Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The latter provides a mechanism for the disparate actions of Sp3 in different systems (29Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 35Liang Y. Robinson D.F. Dennig J. Suske G. Fahl W.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In our gel shift assay using NS20Y nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 A), the intensity of the slow migrating Sp3-AR1 complex (band II) was equivalent to that of Sp1 (band I), whereas the smaller Sp3 complexes (bands III and IV), which presumably represent internally translated Sp3, had much weaker intensity. The relative abundance of full-length Sp3 compared with the shorter isoforms in NS20Y cells could explain the fact that the overall effect of AR1 is activation of transcription. Yet, internally translated Sp3 isoforms appear to play a role in regulating theD1A gene, although the mechanism by which these isoforms inhibit Sp1-mediated transcription remains obscure (6Kennett S.B. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Furthermore, regulation of the relative amounts of internally translated Sp3 isoforms could modulate D1A gene transcription. We also found that a third nuclear factor Zic2 binds to the AR1 sequence and inhibits Sp1-induced D1A promoter activity. The effect of Zic2 was documented both in transient expression experiments using a reporter gene system as well as on the native D1A gene in NS20Y cells. We also demonstrated that the mechanism responsible for the Zic2 action is competition with the binding of both Sp1 and Sp3 to their target DNA sequence. In fact, Zic2 potently prevents the interaction of all Sp3 isoforms with AR1 once again consistent with the observation that the net action of the AR1 element, in the absence of Zic2, is activation of transcription. In addition, the displacement of Sp1 and Sp3 by Zic2 leads to complete suppression of D1A promoter activity suggesting that Zic2 has its own repressor domain. Zic2 mRNA is highly localized to the cerebellum (8Aruga J. Yokota N. Hashimoto M. Furuichi T. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1880-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 11Aruga J. Minowa O. Yaginuma H. Kuno J. Nagai T. Noda T. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 284-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the D1Agene is mostly expressed in the striatum (41Jung A.B. Bennett Jr., J.P. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 94: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Absence of the potent inhibitor Zic2 in the striatum appears to permit highD1A mRNA expression in this brain region, whereas abundant presence of Zic2 in the cerebellum could be an essential repressor of D1A gene transcription. The forgoing observations taken collectively indicate that an activating cis-acting element can be used to regulate target gene transcription both by transcriptional activators and repressors like Sp1, Sp3 (7Hata Y. Duh E. Zhang K. Robinson G.S. Aiello L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19294-19303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and Zic2. We also conclude that the tissue-specific and brain regional specific expression of the D1A gene is determined by a delicate balance among several key transcription factors, some of which recognize and interact with the same target DNA sequence. This complex mode of regulation appears to be a common mechanism for regulating D1A gene expression (42Okazawa H. Imafuku I. Minowa M.T. Kanazawa I. Hamada H. Mouradian M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

A, schematic illustrations of expressed wild-type CRX (Crx WT) and its mutants are shown in the left panel, in which the homeodomain, basic region, WSP domain, and OTX tail are indicated. The right panel shows the transactivation activities of wild-type CRX and its truncation mutants in the presence (white bars) or absence (black bars) of NRL expression. 293 human embryonic kidney cells were cotransfected with a fusion construct consisting of the bovine rhodopsin proximal promoter (−130 to +70 bp) linked to a luciferase reporter cassette (pbRho−130) and with a plasmid expressing wild-type CRX protein (CRX-(1–299)), one of its truncated forms, or an empty expression vector. NRL was expressed heterologously in 293 cells by transfecting the NRL expression construct versus an empty vector. A plasmid expressing CAT (pCAT control vector) was cotransfected as well, and CAT activities were determined by CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In all transfections, the same amount of plasmid DNA was delivered. Rhodopsin promoter activity was read as luciferase activity after normalization with CAT activity for transfection efficiency. -Fold induction was calculated as the -fold increase in rhodopsin promoter activity upon cotransfecting CRX or its mutant compared with that receiving the empty vector. The relative transactivation activity is expressed as the percentage of the -fold induction given by the wild-type CRX-mediated transactivation of the rhodopsin promoter (set as 100%) compared with that contributed by the empty vector (set as 0%, the base line). The data represent means ± S.E. from six independent experiments. B, shown is the amino acid sequence of bovine CRX protein.

This was initially surprising in terms of the Leber congenital amaurosis patients since this disease is generally thought to be autosomal recessive. Analysis of the parents, however, demonstrated that the mutations were de novo since, although paternity was confirmed, none of the parents carried theCRX mutations. Indeed, Silva et al. (19Silva E. Yang J.-M. Li Y. Dharmaraj S. Sundin O.H. Maumenee I.H. Invest. Ophthalmol.

This suggests that haplo-insufficiency of CRX is not sufficient to cause retinal disorders (19Silva E. Yang J.-M. Li Y. Dharmaraj S. Sundin O.H. Maumenee I.H. Invest. Ophthalmol.

The mutated CRX gene associated with retinal diseases may express a functionally impaired CRX. Indeed, point mutations of the homeodomain (i.e. R41W and R90W) were demonstrated to directly or indirectly interfere with CRX binding to its regulatory sequence and/or functioning (15Mitton K.P.

As a first step in this process, we generated and characterized two panels of C-terminal deletions of CRX to examine for 1) their DNA-binding activity with the BAT-1 site on the rhodopsin promoter (3Chen S.

Here, we present the results of this analysis and discuss their implications for understanding the molecular basis of CRX-related retinal dystrophies. 293 human embryonic kidney cells were maintained as described (3Chen S.

A wild-type bovine CRX expression plasmid was cloned as described previously (3Chen S. Wang Q.-L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J.

Truncated forms of CRX were amplified by polymerase chain reaction utilizing primers with appropriate added restriction enzyme recognition sites and subcloned into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pcDNA3.1/HisC mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). All deletions are in-frame. Sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Physiology Department, Tufts DNA Sequencing Facility, Boston, MA). Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared with a QIAGEN plasmid kit. In vitro transcribed and translated proteins were prepared using the T7 RNA polymerase TnT kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Labeled lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and destained and then dried and exposed to x-ray film (Fuji Rx) for autoradiography. The BAT-1 oligonucleotides used were as follows: 5′-GTGAGGATTAATATGATTAATAACGCCCC-3′ and its exact complement (synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc., The Woodlands, TX). Double-stranded probe was 32P-radiolabeled with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) and gel-purified. Radiolabeled probe was mixed with in vitrotranslated proteins, and EMSA was performed following a modified protocol as described (3Chen S. Wang Q.-L. Nie Z. Sun H. Lennon G. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Zack D.J. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Four μg of poly(dG-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used, and the binding reaction was carried out in a total volume of 30 μl. 293 cells were transfected with equal amounts of expression plasmids for CRX and its truncated forms as described above. Cells were harvested and washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.), and extracts from both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the transfected cells were prepared as described (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). Extracts were then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equal amounts of lysates from each sample were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the standard protocol. Western blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 0.2% I-Block (Western-Light kit, Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. Anti-Xpress monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) was used as suggested, followed by the chemiluminescence method of detection (Western-Light kit). Transfections of 293 cells were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were seeded onto 35-mm diameter dishes at 30–50% confluence. The pbRho−130 rhodopsin/reporter (0.3 μg) plasmid (13Kumar R. Chen S. Scheurer D. Wang Q.-L. Duh E. Sung C.H. Rehemtulla A. Swaroop A. Adler R. Zack D.J. J. Biol.

After 6 h, 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added. Cells were grown and harvested 40 h post-transfection, washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer (Promega), and detached using a rubber policeman. The lysis mixture was frozen, thawed, and centrifuged. A 50-μl aliquot was measured for luciferase activity by mixing with 50 μl of luciferin (Promega), and luminescence was measured in a Monolight luminometer (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) for 20 s. CAT activity was determined using a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on 50 μl of cell lysate. Subsequently, luciferase activities were normalized relative to the CAT activity of each sample. Values are presented as means ± S.E. To determine statistical significance, Student's t test was conducted. A panel of C-terminal truncations of bovine CRX was generated to test its functional domains responsible for transactivation. The guiding principles in generating the original set of deletions were the positions of conserved sequences within the OTD/OTX family and the locations of the known naturally occurring CRX mutations (1Furukawa T.

This construct would allow us to assess the role of the OTX tail, which is believed to encode a transactivation domain of the factor. CRX-(1–107) preserves essentially only the paired-like homeodomain and lacks the C-terminal region of the molecule, including the OTX tail, the WSP domain, and the basic region. This truncated CRX polypeptide would permit a comparison with the previous CRX deletion, probing the contributions of the WSP domain and the basic region of CRX to transactivation. CRX-(1–79) contains only the first two helices of the homeodomain, with the recognition helix (helix 3) completely deleted. CRX-(1–54) has only an N-terminal fragment of the homeodomain. The last two constructs would allow us to probe the functional roles of the CRX homeodomain. To assess the binding of CRX and its deletion derivatives to its responsive element, we chose the BAT-1 site, which shows the highest affinity for CRX binding among othercis-elements on the rhodopsin proximal promoter,i.e. Ret-1 and Ret-4 (3Chen S.

Individual CRX constructs of the panel created were expressed in the presence of radiolabeled methionine using an in vitro transcription and translation system, and the different forms of truncated CRX produced were confirmed by SDS-PAGE to be of expected size and at similar levels (Fig.2 A). Identical transcription and translation reactions were then carried out with unlabeled methionine, and the resulting products were used for EMSAs with radiolabeled BAT-1 oligomers as probes. The results shown in Fig.2 B demonstrate that CRX with a C-terminal truncation removing helix 3 (the recognition helix of the homeodomain), as in CRX-(1–79) (or further deleting almost the entire homeodomain, as in CRX-(1–54)), resulted in a total loss of DNA-binding ability. The presence or absence of other portions of the CRX molecule (i.e. the OTX tail, WSP domain, and basic region, as observed with wild-type CRX, CRX-(1–285), and CRX-(1–107)) did not affect the BAT-1 EMSA results, suggesting that the CRX homeodomain acts independently of other parts of the molecule in mediating DNA binding. A complementary EMSA experiment was performed in which equal amounts of radiolabeled wild-type and truncated CRX proteins were incubated with unlabeled BAT-1 probe, and identical results were obtained (data not shown). Wild-type CRX and the C-terminal mutants were transiently expressed in 293 human embryonic kidney cells. Before assessing the various constructs for transactivation activity, their levels of expression were compared. Both the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of the cells transfected with each of the constructs were isolated and analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody against the Xpress peptide tag. As shown in Fig. 2 C, wild-type CRX and the CRX-(1–285) and CRX-(1–107) mutants were expressed at similar levels in the nuclei of the transfected cells. In contrast, no expressed protein was present in transfectants with the CRX-(1–79) and CRX-(1–54) expression vectors. None of the expressed CRX forms were retained in the cytoplasm (data not shown). The expression levels of different forms of CRX in the nucleus were quantified by densitometry. From this analysis, no significant variability (p > 0.6) in the abundance of the CRX mutant proteins was detected in the nuclei of transfected cells. The various CRX constructs were then tested for their ability to transactivate a rhodopsin promoter/luciferase reporter in transiently transfected cells. Photoreceptor-like cells (e.g. Y79 and WERI retinoblastoma cells, pineal cells, and primary retinal cultures) commonly express CRX in a predominant and constitutive manner, and mutated forms of CRX did not exhibit dominant-negative effects on endogenously or heterologously expressed wild-type CRX in these cells (data not shown). For this reason, we could not dissect functional domains of CRX in any of these cell systems. 293 human embryonic kidney cells were employed instead, as they have been used extensively for studies of CRX bioactivity (3Chen S.

CRX (and NRL; see below) is not expressed in these cells, and the activity of the proximal rhodopsin promoter (−130 to +70 bp harboring the BAT-1, NRE, and Ret-4 sites) can be readily transactivated (3–6 fold) (data not shown) by CRX heterologous expression. Under the conditions used, maximal transactivation by wild-type CRX was set at 100% transactivation activity (Fig. 1 A, right panel, black bars). The C-terminal mutant CRX-(1–285) (without the OTX tail) demonstrated 46% of the activity of the full-length protein, and the decrease was statistically significant (p = 10−5), with it noted above that t"

Mutations in CBF genes are found in leukemias and bone disorders. CBFs consist of a DNA-binding CBFα subunit (Runx1, Runx2, or Runx3) and a non-DNA-binding CBFβ subunit. CBFα binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner, whereas CBFβ enhances DNA binding by CBFα. Recent structural analyses of the DNA-binding Runt domain of CBFα and the CBFβ subunit identified the heterodimerization surfaces on each subunit. Here we identify amino acids in CBFβ that mediate binding to CBFα. We determine the energy contributed by each of these amino acids to heterodimerization and the importance of these residues forin vivo function. These data refine the structural analyses and further support the hypothesis that CBFβ enhances DNA binding by inducing a conformational change in the Runt domain.

The CBFβ subunit is a novel structure consisting of five α-helices and six β-strands arranged as a twisted six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. Chemical shift perturbation studies identified sequences in both the Runt domain and CBFβ at the heterodimerization interface (6Tang Y.-Y. Crute B.E. Kelley III, J.J. Huang X. Yan J. Shi J.

Biol. 1999; 6: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of the Runx1 Runt domain-CBFβ complex also delineated an interaction surface on each protein (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular details of the interaction have not yet been described.Here we analyze the interaction surface on CBFβ, and identify amino acids that contribute energetically to heterodimerization. We find that Asn-104, Gly-61, and to a lesser extent Gln-67, Leu-103, Arg-3, and Val-4 in CBFβ contribute to heterodimerization with the CBFα Runt domain. Biochemical analyses of mutated CBFβ proteins find no evidence for direct interaction of the CBFβ proteins with DNA in the ternary complex. These data lend support to and further refine the structures determined by NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography.DISCUSSIONWe performed a structure-guided, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the CBFβ subunit to identify the amino acids that contribute energetically to heterodimerization with the Runt domain. Chemical shift perturbation analysis was first used to identify amino acids in the CBFα interface (31Huang X. Peng J.W. Speck N.A. Bushweller J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These were substituted with alanines and interactions with full-length CBFα (Runx1) were assessed in a yeast two-hybrid assay, an experimental setup that does not involve DNA binding by the CBFα subunit. CBFβ proteins with amino acid substitutions that affected activity in the yeast two-hybrid assay were evaluated by NMR spectroscopy for the effects of the introduced mutations on the CBFβ fold. We also examined CBFβ proteins with alanine substitutions at Arg-3 and Val-4, residues that were identified by NMR (31Huang X. Peng J.W. Speck N.A. Bushweller J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and implicated by truncation analyses to be required for heterodimerization (34Golling G. Li L.-H. Pepling M. Stebbins M. Gergen J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 932-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Kagoshima H. Akamatsu Y. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33074-33082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mutated CBFβ proteins with intact structures were then analyzed biochemically to measure the energy contributed by each of their side chains to the overall binding energy. The free energy of heterodimerization of the CBFβ subunit to the CBFα·DNA complex is 9.18 kcal. The free energy changes caused by the R3A, V4A, Q67A, L103A, and N104A substitutions are listed in TableIII. Substitution of a Gly-61 with alanine presumably perturbs heterodimerization by introducing a methyl group into the interaction interface. In both in vitro and in vivo assays Asn-104 appears to make the most important energetic contribution to heterodimerization and may reside in a hot spot of binding energy in the heterodimer interface (52Bogan A.S. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 53Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar).The chemical shift perturbation analyses done by two independent labs (31Huang X. Peng J.W. Speck N.A. Bushweller J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Goger M. Gupta V. Kim W.-Y. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Werner M.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the co-crystal structure of the Runt domain·CBFβ complex off DNA (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified an overlapping set of amino acids at the heterodimerization interface. Residues 61, 64, 67, 101, 102, 103, and 104 were implicated in all three studies, and alanine substitutions at each of these positions affected CBFα binding in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Several of these mutations, including L64A, M101A, I102A, and L66A (Leu-66 was not implicated in the co-crystal structure) (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) perturbed the CBFβ structure. These amino acids may also participate in heterodimerization, but this cannot be assessed due to the impact of the alanine substitutions on the protein fold. The side chains from all of these residues (Leu-64, Leu-66, Met-101, and Ile-102) are buried in the core of the CBFβ protein.Asn-63 and Ser-65 were implicated by both the chemical shift perturbation analysis by Goger et al. (32Goger M. Gupta V. Kim W.-Y. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Werner M.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the co-crystal structure (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as forming part of the interaction interface. Asn-63 is conserved in the Drosophila CBFβ homologues Brother and Big Brother, whereas Ser-65 is a glutamine in bothDrosophila proteins. Both Asn-63 and Ser-65 point toward the solvent-exposed surface of CBFβ. Ser-65 in CBFβ contacts two amino acids in the Runt domain (Met-106 and Phe-153) and Asn-63 contacts four amino acids (Met-106, Tyr-113, Ser-114, and Thr-149) one of which (Thr-149) is mutated in a cleidocranial dysplasia patient (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Zhou G. Chen Y. Zhou L. Thirunavukkarasu K. Hecht J. Chitayat D. Gelb B.D. Pirinen S. Berry S.A. Greenberg C.R. Karsenty G. Lee B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2311-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, alanine substitutions at Asn-63 or Ser-65 did not affect interaction with CBFα in the yeast two-hybrid assay. It is likely that Asn-63 and Ser-65 contribute less to the binding energy than Asn-104 and that we could not detect the effect of alanine substitutions at these positions in the assay. We tentatively conclude that Runt domain interactions with individual side chains within β-strand 3 do not provide as much to the overall binding energy as Asn-104 and may contribute to a shell of energetically less important contacts surrounding Asn-104 (52Bogan A.S. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar).The chemical shift perturbation study of Goger et al. (32Goger M. Gupta V. Kim W.-Y. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Werner M.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which was also performed in the presence of DNA, identified eight additional amino acids that were not examined in this study, including Arg-78, Arg-83, Lys-98, Val-106, Gln-133, Gln-134, and Glu-135. Arg-78 and Arg-83 are in the flexible, non-conserved loop region connecting β-strands 3 and 4, and the crystal structure of the Runt domain·CBFβ complex rules out their involvement in heterodimerization (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Val-106, in the turn between β-strand 4 and 5, is conserved in the Drosophila proteins and close to amino acids that are important for heterodimerization, but its side chain is buried in the CBFβ core (0.0% solvent exposed). Gln-133, Gln-134, and Glu-135 are in α-helix 4. Of these only Glu-135 is completely conserved, but most of its surface is not exposed to solvent (4.3%). Lys-98 is in β-strand 4, is a lysine in theDrosophila Big Brother protein and an arginine in Brother, and showed a small chemical shift perturbation in our study as well (31Huang X. Peng J.W. Speck N.A. Bushweller J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, none of these amino acids were found at the heterodimerization interface in the co-crystal structure, so we believe it is unlikely that they are intimately involved in CBFα binding.Warren et al. (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also identified seven amino acids buried at the heterodimerization interface not examined in this study, including Pro-2, Val-5, Lys-11, Phe-17, Arg-33, Val-58, and Pro-100. Of these buried residues, Pro-2, Arg-33, and Val-58 lie within 3.6 Å of amino acids in the Runt domain. Pro-2 and Pro-100 are not detected in15N-1H HSQC spectra, because they lack backbone NH groups. Arg-33, Val-58, Pro-2, and Val-5 are conserved in theDrosophila Brother and Big Brother proteins, whereas Pro-100 is tyrosine in Big Brother and a serine in Brother. In more recent spectra on a ternary complex containing 100%2H,13C,15N-labeled CBFβ in the presence of unlabeled Runt domain·DNA, we also identified chemical shift perturbations at Val-5 (6Tang Y.-Y. Crute B.E. Kelley III, J.J. Huang X. Yan J. Shi J. Hartman K.L. Laue T.M. Speck N.A. Bushweller J.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although neither chemical shift perturbation study implicated Lys-11, Phe-17, Arg-33, or Val-58 in heterodimerization (6Tang Y.-Y. Crute B.E. Kelley III, J.J. Huang X. Yan J. Shi J. Hartman K.L.

Biol. 1999; 6: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), an interaction does not necessarily result in a chemical shift change, and therefore these amino acids may also be involved in binding CBFα. Both Arg-33 and Val-58 form contacts with Tyr-113, a residue that provides a large surface area of interaction in the Runt domain (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Asn-104, which provides the most important contact to the Runt domain we identified, is paired with the Runt domain strand βG in the co-crystal structure (Fig. 6) (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the NMR solution structures Asn-104 is in the turn between β-strands 4 and 5, whereas in the co-crystal structure it forms part of a short parallel β-sheet extension consisting of residues 102–104 of CBFβ and residues 159–161 of the Runt domain. The β-sheet extension is stabilized by a cluster of hydrophobic residues in CBFβ that include Met-101, Ile-102, and Leu-103 (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Asn-104 forms multiple contacts with three residues in the Runt domain (Asp-66, Val-159, and T161). The mutagenesis data support the conclusion that the amino acid 102–104 region of CBFβ participates in binding the CBFα subunit. The N104A mutation also significantly affects binding of the Runt domain-CBFβ heterodimer to DNA (K4), by 2.5-fold. CBFβ is thought to increase the affinity of the Runt domain for DNA by inducing a localized conformational change that alters the Runt domain·DNA interface (6Tang Y.-Y. Crute B.E. Kelley III, J.J. Huang X. Yan J. Shi J. Hartman K.L. Laue T.M. Speck N.A. Bushweller J.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Warren et al. (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) hypothesize that the induced conformational change of the Runt domain may be mediated by stabilization of the Tyr-162 side chain in the Runt domain by CBFβ. Tyr-162 is predominantly solvent-exposed (37.4%) in the Runt domain·DNA complex (5Berardi M. Sun C. Zehr M. Abildgaard F. Peng J. Speck N.A. Bushweller J.H. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: 1247-1256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but oriented toward the hybrophobic core of the Runt domain in the Runt domain·CBFβ complex, whereas Thr-161 and His-163 are buried in the heterodimer interface (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The conformation of residues 161–163 and 165–166 in the Runt domain is significantly altered in the Runt domain·CBFβ·DNA complex relative to the Runt domain·DNA complex (6Tang Y.-Y. Crute B.E. Kelley III, J.J. Huang X. Yan J. Shi J. Hartman K.L. Laue T.M. Speck N.A. Bushweller J.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The CBFβ(N104A) mutant may be less effective at inducing a conformational change in this region of the Runt domain, thereby accounting for the increase inK4.At the other end of the Runt domain β-barrel, it has been proposed that Runt domain loop βC-D interacts with CBFβ through multiple contacts mediated by the Tyr-113 side chain to residues in CBFβ, including Arg-33, Val-58, and Asn-63 (7Warren A.J. Bravo J. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3004-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arg-33 in CBFβ is located in the loop between β-strand 1 and the 310 helix, Val-58 is in β-strand 2, and Asn-63 is in β-strand 3. Gly-61, which is very sensitive to alanine substitution, is near Tyr-113 and contacts Asn-109 in the Runt domain. We predict that substitution of Gly-61 with an alanine will move the main chain oxygen of Asn-109 in the Runt domain away from the heterodimer interface, destabilizing the interaction. The region of the Runt domain near the end of βC and the βC-D loop along with Gly-61 in the β2–3 loop of CBFβ may contribute to another hot spot of binding energy at the heterodimer interface. Core-binding factors (CBFs)1 are a small family of heterodimeric transcription factors that play critical roles in normal development and disease. CBFs consist of two subunits, CBFα and CBFβ. The CBFα subunit binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner (1Kamachi Y. Ogawa E. Asano M. Ishida S. Murakami Y. Satake M. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4808-4819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Kagoshima H. Inuzuka M. Lu J. Satake M. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6859-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). CBFβ heterodimerizes with CBFα and increases its affinity for DNA (3Ogawa E. Inuzuka M. Maruyama M. Satake M. Naito-Fujimoto M.

Biol. 1993; 13: 3324-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which CBFβ enhances DNA binding by CBFα is unusual in that CBFβ does not establish contacts to additional phosphates or bases in the DNA (1Kamachi Y. Ogawa E. Asano M. Ishida S. Murakami Y. Satake M. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4808-4819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wang S. Wang Q. Crute B.E. Melnikova I.N. Keller S.R. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell.

Initial experiments using this methodology showed induction of mRNA for the proto-oncogene and AP-1 transcription factor component c-fos at 30 min (1Akai Y. Homma T. Burns K.D. Yasuda T. Badr K.F. Harris R.C Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C482-C490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, increases in both MC proliferation (2Harris R.C. Haralson M.A. Badr K.F. Lab.

Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 476-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The most well described mammalian MAPK cascade, p42/44 or ERK, is well recognized to lie upstream of AP-1 (15Davis R.J. J. Biol.

ERK-dependent AP-1 induction has been demonstrated in endothelial cells in response to shear (17Jalali S. Li Y.S. Sotoudeh M. Yuan S. Li S. Chien S. Shyy J.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).In vivo, cyclic strain in the aortic wall activates ERK and AP-1 (18Xu Q. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Udelsman R. Holbrook N.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and glomerular ERK activation and AP-1 nuclear protein binding have been shown in response to angiotensin II infusion (19Hamaguchi A. Kim S. Yano M. Yamanaka S. Iwao H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 372-380PubMed Google Scholar). AP-1 activation may be important in the pathogenesis of glomerular sclerosis, because AP-1 activation has been shown to mediate transforming growth factor beta-1 induction (20Kim S.J. Angel P.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar).Recent data indicates that the actin cytoskeleton is important for ERK signaling. Cytochalasin-D prevented strain-induced ERK activity in vascular smooth muscle cells (22Numaguchi K. Eguchi S. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LIM kinase-1 is intimately involved in induction of serum response factor by serum, suggesting a central role for the actin cytoskeleton in intracellular signaling (23Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). ERK does interact with the actin cytoskeleton (24Leinweber B.D. Leavis P.C. Grabarek Z. Wang C.L. Morgan K.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and ERK signaling in response to lysophosphatidic acid (25Della Rocca G.J.

Nikol'skii N.N. Tsitologiya. 1998; 40: 639-647PubMed Google Scholar) is dependent on the presence of an intact actin cytoskeleton.Recent studies indicate a role for NO in inhibition of cytoskeletal organization. Several NO donors and a constitutively active form of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) inhibited MC adhesion to extracellular matrix protein via inhibition of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and actin cytoskeletal disruption (27Yao J. Schoecklmann H.O. Prols F. Gauer S. Sterzel R.B. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 598-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle cells, cGMP-dependent kinase phosphorylated and inactivated RhoA, thereby disrupting the actin cytoskeleton (28Sauzeau V. Le Jeune H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A.

Consequently, we hypothesized that nitric oxide, via cyclic GMP, would limit MC ERK signaling in response to mechanical strain through cytoskeletal disruption.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureHarlan Sprague-Dawley rat mesangial cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. Experiments were carried out in cells between passage 15–20.Application of Strain/RelaxationMesangial cells (5 × 104/well) were plated on to 6-well plates with flexible bottoms coated with bovine type I collagen (Flexcell International Corp., McKeesport, PA). Cells were grown to confluence for 72 h and then rendered quiescent by incubation for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal calf serum. To characterize the time of maximum response, cells were initially exposed to cycles of strain/relaxation for periods of 2, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min generated by a cyclic vacuum produced by a computer-driven system (Flexercell Strain Unit 2000, Flexcell International Corp.). Plates were exposed to continuous cycles of strain/relaxation, with each cycle being 0.5 s of strain and 0.5 s of relaxation, for a total of 60 cycles per min. Initially, the vacuum pressures used were −10 to −27 kPa, inducing a 16–28% elongation in the diameter of the surface. Subsequent experiments were performed at the time and strain level of maximal response, 10 min and −27 kPa, respectively (average 28% elongation in diameter of the plates).For the experiments studying NO effects, 8-bromo cyclic guanosine monophosphate (8-bromo-cGMP, Sigma) was added in the indicated concentrations 10 min prior to the initiation of stretch protocols. For experiments studying cytoskeletal manipulation, cytochalasin-D (Sigma) or jasplakinolide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added prior to the initiation of stretch protocols at the indicated concentrations.p42/44 MAPK (ERK) ActivityProtein Isolation and Western BlottingInitially, the time course and concentration dependence of ERK activity in response to stretch were studied, and subsequent experiments were performed at −27 kPa at 10 min. Cultures were serum starved overnight prior to stretch protocols. After stretch protocols with or without inhibitors, medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS. Protein was isolated as described above, and 40 μg of sample was separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. After electroblotting to a nitrocellulose membrane, membranes were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with 25 ml of blocking buffer (1× TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% w/v nonfat dry milk) and then overnight at 4 °C with ERK1/2 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) polyclonal antibody (1:1000)(New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in 10 ml of antibody dilution buffer (1× TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 with 5% bovine serum albumin) with gentle rocking at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed three times with 1× TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000) in 10 ml of blocking buffer for 45 min at room temperature. After three further washes in TBS, the membrane was incubated with LumiGlo reagent and then exposed to x-ray film.Activity Assays200 μg of total cellular protein was incubated with immobilized phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) monoclonal antibody (15 μl, New England Biolabs) with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. Lysates were microcentrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 rpm to recover the beads, and the pellet was washed twice with 0.5 ml of 1× lysis buffer. For the kinase assay, after immunoprecipitation, pellets were washed twice with 0.5 ml of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmMgCl2). ERK activity was then measured by suspending the pellet in 50 μl of 1× kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of Elk1 fusion protein as substrate. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated with 25 μm 3× SDS sample buffer (187.5 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% w/v SDS, 30% glycerol, 150 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3% w/v bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, vortexed, and then microcentrifuged for 2 min. 20 μl of sample was then run on a 10% non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. After blotting to nitrocellulose, membranes were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with 25 ml of blocking buffer (1× TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 with 5% w/v nonfat dry milk) and then overnight at 4 °C with phospho-specific anti-Elk1 (Ser383) antibody 1:1000 in 10 ml of antibody dilution buffer. Membranes were washed three times with 1× TBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h at room temperature. After three further washes in TBS, the membrane was processed as above.Fluorescence MicroscopyERK Nuclear TranslocationAfter each strain protocol with or without inhibitors, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (300 μl/well) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS, then permeabilized in 100% methanol for 5 min at −20 °C, washed again with PBS, and incubated with a 1:50 dilution of anti-phospho-ERK (Thr180/Tyr182) (New England Biolabs) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with a 1:50 dilution of an Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) conjugate (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Cells were washed and then mounted by removing the flexible base from each well and placing it directly on a glass slide using one drop of anti-fade mount medium (Slow Fade, Molecular Probes). A drop of mount medium was then placed on top of the cells and covered with a glass slip. Slides were stored at 4 °C in the dark until confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) within 10 days.F-actin StainingMC were fixed with formaldehyde exactly as described above and then permeabilized by dipping in acetone for 5 min at −20 °C. Subsequently, Texas Red phalloidin solution (Molecular Probes) was applied for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed, mounted, and analyzed exactly as described above.Nuclear Protein Binding to AP-1 Consensus SequencesAfter each strain protocol, MC were washed in cold PBS, and nuclear extracts were prepared by lysis in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 20 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.6% Nonidet P-40), homogenized, and sedimented at 16,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing 0.42 m NaCl2, 20% glycerol and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 20 min at 16,000 × g, the supernatant containing nuclear proteins was collected, and the protein concentration was measured with the Bio-Rad assay kit.Radiolabeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides were prepared by incubating 2 μl of consensus oligonucleotide (1.75 pmol/μl, Promega), 1 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase 10× buffer, 1 μl of [32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 5 μl of nuclease-free water for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Unlabeled [32P]ATP was removed from the oligonucleotide mixture with Chroma-Spin STE-10 columns (CLONTECH).Nuclear proteins (3 μg) were incubated with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 1.8 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at room temperature and then reacted with radiolabeled consensus oligonucleotides at room temperature for 20 min (50,000–100,000 cpm). Reaction mixtures were electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. Competition experiments were performed with 100× excess unlabeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides.DISCUSSIONIn the best-characterized animal model of chronic renal failure, the subtotally nephrectomized rat, increased glomerular capillary pressure (as little as 20%) triggers MC responses that ultimately result in glomerulosclerosis (10Yasuda T.

In vitro studies of the application of cyclic mechanical strain to MC have demonstrated that this stimulus results in MC proliferation (2Harris R.C. Haralson M.A. Badr K.F. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 548-554PubMed Google Scholar, 32Harris R.C. Akai Y. Yasuda T. Homma T. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1994; 45: S17-S21PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kawata Y. Fujii Z. Sakamura T. Kitano M.

Invest. 1992; 66: 548-554PubMed Google Scholar) and fibronectin (12Hirakata M. Kaname S. Chung U.G. Joki N. Hori Y. Noda M. Takuwa Y. Okazaki T. Fujita T. Katoh T. Kurokawa K. Takuwa Y.X.O.T. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1028-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).We and others have studied how the mechanical signal is transduced in mesangial cells. The first site of transduction occurs at the cell membrane (34Ingram A.J. Scholey J.W. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertension. 2000; 9: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Initial studies of mechanical strain in MC noted increased proliferation in concert with induction of expression of the proto-oncogene and AP-1 component c-fos (1Akai Y. Homma T. Burns K.D. Yasuda T. Badr K.F. Harris R.C Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C482-C490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both down-regulation of protein kinase C (32Harris R.C. Akai Y. Yasuda T. Homma T. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1994; 45: S17-S21PubMed Google Scholar) and calcium chelation (32Harris R.C. Akai Y. Yasuda T. Homma T. Kidney Int. Suppl. 1994; 45: S17-S21PubMed Google Scholar) were shown to attenuate c-fos expression induced by strain. Studies of the proliferative effects of mechanical strain showed matrix dependence. Cells adherent to fibronectin showed the greatest strain-induced proliferative response, and this was inhibited by coincubation with RGD peptides (35Wilson E. Sudhir K. Ives H.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Integrin-focal adhesion complex interactions have been studied, and tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion-associated kinase pp125FAK was seen in stretched MC (36Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Furuya H. Morino N. Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Nojima Y. Komuro I.X.Y.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Integrin binding to extracellular matrix protein leads to clustering and the formation of a signaling complex termed a focal adhesion that associates with actin filaments, leading to their reorganization into filamentous stress fibers (37Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3784) Google Scholar). Stretched MC elongate and align in the direction of stress, and actin filaments coalesce and orient themselves along this long axis (2Harris R.C. Haralson M.A. Badr K.F. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 548-554PubMed Google Scholar). Various tyrosine kinases associate with focal adhesions after their formation, in particular focal adhesion kinase and the Src family kinases (38Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). In mesangial cells, cyclic strain-induced increases of vascular permeability factor mRNA are Src-dependent (39Gruden G. Thomas S. Burt D. Lane S. Chusney G. Sacks S. Viberti G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12112-12116Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), providing evidence that the assembly of the focal adhesion complex and its association with kinases are important in the transduction of mechanical signals in MC. Further downstream, Src and focal adhesion kinase activate Ras via the Shc-Grb2-Sos complex (40Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Ras is activated in response to cyclic strain in vascular smooth muscle cells (41Komuro I. Kudo S. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Yazaki Y. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 42Li C. Hu Y. Mayr M. Xu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).Signaling of mechanical stimuli to the cell nucleus after membrane events involves the ubiquitous MAPK cascades. ERK interacts with the actin cytoskeleton (24Leinweber B.D. Leavis P.C. Grabarek Z. Wang C.L. Morgan K.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which is indispensible for signaling in response to lysophosphatidic acid (25Della Rocca G.J. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13978-13984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or epidermal growth factor (26Arnautov A.M. Nikol'skii N.N. Tsitologiya. 1998; 40: 639-647PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the MAPK cascades consists of three protein kinases acting sequentially, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase activator (MKK), a mitogen-activated protein kinase activator (MEK), and a mitogen-activated protein kinase (15Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown activation of all three cascades in MC in response to cyclic strain (14Ingram A. Thai K. Ly H. Kang M. Scholey J.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 476-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). More recently, we have demonstrated inhibition of strain-induced ERK and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase by NO donors (43Ingram A.J. James L. Ly H. Thai K. Cai L. Scholey J.W. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1067-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, both ERK and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase may induce AP-1 (15Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). As noted, cyclic strain in the aortic wall activates ERK and AP-1 (18Xu Q. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Udelsman R. Holbrook N.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and glomerular ERK activation and AP-1 nuclear protein binding occur with angiotensin II infusion (19Hamaguchi A. Kim S. Yano M. Yamanaka S. Iwao H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 372-380PubMed Google Scholar), a maneuver that would be expected to increase glomerular pressure.Accordingly, we sought to determine how NO interfered with transmission of the stretch signal to ERK. Given recent data showing that 8-bromo-cGMP inhibited actin cytoskeletal organization via cyclic GMP kinase-mediated phosphorylation of RhoA (28Sauzeau V. Le Jeune H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Bertoglio J. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21722-21729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), we elected to study whether the effect of NO donors on stretch-induced ERK activity was through cytoskeletal disruption.We first observed that stretch led to the formation of actin stress fibers within 10 min in MC. Prevention of stretch-induced actin stress fiber formation in MC completely eliminated the usual stretch-induced ERK activity. This is consistent with a recent report in vascular smooth muscle cells using the same stretch system (22Numaguchi K. Eguchi S. Yamakawa T. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Having established cytoskeletal dependence of stretch-induced ERK activity in MC, we sought to characterize the effects of NO on the actin cytoskeleton after stretch. Phalloidin staining of F-actin revealed that either SNAP or 8-bromo-cGMP led to cytoskeletal disassembly after 10 min of incubation. This has been observed in resting aortic smooth muscle cells with 40 min of 100 μm 8-bromo-cGMP (28Sauzeau V. Le Jeune H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Smolenski A. Lohmann S.M. Bertoglio J. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21722-21729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Pre-incubation with 8-bromo-cGMP also inhibited stretch-induced ERK activation in MC in this study, consistent with its effects on the cytoskeleton. In accord with this, phospho-ERK induction and nuclear translocation, which was easily visualized after 10 min of stretch, was essentially prevented by pre-incubation with 8-bromo-cGMP.Whereas these data demonstrate an association between cytoskeletal disruption and prevention of strain-induced ERK activity by 8-bromo-cGMP, we sought to strengthen this link by studying cytoskeletal stabilization. A major finding of this study is that incubation with jasplakinolide in addition to 8-bromo-cGMP prior to and during stretch prevented 8-bromo-cGMP-mediated inhibition of strain-induced ERK1/2 activity. Furthermore, induction and nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK by immunofluorescent microscopy was also preserved by co-incubation with jasplakinolide. The effects of jasplakinolide on the actin cytoskeleton are complex, but jasplakinolide appears to stabilize actin stress fibers by decreasing the dissociation rate of actin subunits (29Bu"
https://openalex.org/W2095240605,"To investigate a cDNA encoding cation current, we isolated an alternatively spliced form of a rat Trp3, designated Trp3sv. Trp3sv encodes 736 amino acids with a unique N terminus and six transmembrane segments. Expression of the cRNA in Xenopus oocytes was successfully performed. The cation selective current appeared after the addition of ionomycin or induced by prolonged depolarization but not by hyperpolarization. This induction was not observed by a treatment with thapsigargin, phorbol ester, or ATP. Na(+), K(+), tetraethylammonium, and divalent cations were permeable, while N-methylglucamine and chloride were nominally impermeable ions. The currents were not inhibited by flufenamate ruthenium red but nonspecifically by 2 mm Gd(3+). Northern as well as Western blot suggested lower levels of the expression observed in some organs, while reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction suggested that it widely spread among various organs. Therefore, we may conclude that N-terminal spliced valiant of Trp3, Trp3sv, encodes a calcium-activated cation channel in various organs."

Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Inactive DFF40/CAD in non-apoptotic cells is a heterodimeric complex with its natural inhibitor DFF45 (17Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar), also known as ICAD (21Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Further studies in murine cells have found that transcription of the ICAD gene results in not only the previously reported 45-kDa protein (ICADL or DFF45) but also a 35-kDa protein (ICADS or DFF35) due to alternative splicing (20Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar, 22Gu J. Dong R.P. Zhang C. McLaughlin D.F. Wu M.X. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20759-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Whereas both DFF45 and DFF35 can bind to DFF40/CAD and share an identical domain (amino acid residues 101–180) (22Gu J. Dong R.P. Zhang C. McLaughlin D.F. Wu M.X. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20759-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), only DFF45 was reported to be functional. DFF45 seems to be important for the proper folding of the newly synthesized DFF40/CAD, and when binding to the latter, it also inhibits the DNase activity of DFF40 (21Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 22Gu J. Dong R.P. Zhang C. McLaughlin D.F. Wu M.X. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37450-37454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the role of DFF35/ICADS is not clear, it appears to possess a stronger ability to bind to DFF40/CAD in vitro than does DFF45/ICADL (22Gu J. Dong R.P. Zhang C. McLaughlin D.F. Wu M.X. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20759-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which suggests that DFF35/ICADS participates in the regulation of DFF40/CAD activity in vivo as well.The activation of CAD involves the cleavage of ICAD, which results in the relief of the inhibition of CAD. ICAD is specifically cleaved by caspase-3 or -7 (25Wolf B.B. Schuler M. Echeverri F. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30651-30656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). ICAD with mutated caspase cleavage sites possesses the ability to suppress DNA fragmentation during apoptosis (20Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that caspase-3-mediated ICAD cleavage occurs in the cytosol and that CAD is translocated to the nucleus after it is released from the complex, where it exercises its nuclease activity (21Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). This hypothesis, based on the studies of lymphoid cells, however, has not been fully tested in vivo and in other types of cells.To further elucidate the precise mechanisms by which caspases promote neuronal apoptosis, we have investigated the nuclear apoptotic events mediated by caspases in neuronal cells. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a DFF35/ICADS counterpart in the rat, the species that is extensively used for modeling neurological diseases. We found that DFF35/ICADS, but not DFF45/ICADL, is the predominant form of ICAD expressed in the rodent central nervous system and many other organ systems. DFF35/ICADS binds to DFF40/CAD and is fully functional. It suppresses DFF40/CAD activity and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in caspase-3-dependent neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that the DFF35/DFF40 complexes are mainly localized in the nucleus of neuronal cells and that the activation of DFF40/CAD is a nuclear process that requires nuclear translocation of caspase-3. These results identify DFF35/ICADS as the predominant endogenous inhibitor of DFF40/CAD in neurons and demonstrate a novel mechanism by which DFF40/CAD is activated during apoptosis.DISCUSSIONSubsequent to the identification of the DFF complex as the major regulator of apoptotic DNA degradation in HeLa cells (17Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar), homologues of DFF with comparable functions had been discovered in humans, mice, and Drosophila melanogaster (18Mukae N. Enari M. Sakahira H. Fukuda Y. Inazawa J. Toh H. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9123-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar, 21Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 29Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Hence, DFF-mediated nuclear destruction constitutes an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that plays a pivotal role in the execution of apoptotic cellular death. An important functional property of DFF is that the DNase activity displayed by DFF is negatively regulated by its inhibitory subunits, DFF45/ICADL and/or DFF35/ICADS. Consistent with this regulation, we have identified a counterpart of DFF35/ICADS in rat brain that binds to DFF40/CAD and suppresses apoptotic DNA fragmentation.One major finding of this study is that the short form of ICAD, DFF35/ICADS, is the predominant DFF40/CAD inhibitor expressed in various rodent tissues. Significantly, DFF35/ICADS is the exclusive form of ICAD found in the rat and mouse central nervous system and several other systems (Fig. 2). Furthermore, DFF35/ICADS, but not DFF45/ICADL, was co-immunoprecipitated with DFF40/CAD in rat brain cell extracts, indicating that DFF35/ICADS is the endogenous inhibitory subunit of the DFF complex. Our results contradict the recent report (30Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in which DFF40/CAD was found to be predominantly associated with DFF45/ICADL in mouse WR19L and human Jurkat T lymphoma cells. This discrepancy can be explained, at least in part, by the alternative expression of the two forms of ICAD in different systems. Whereas DFF35/ICADS and DFF45/ICADL are present at equivalent levels in these cell lines (30Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), little or no DFF45/ICADL is detectable in the rodent central nervous system.It has been shown in the reticulocyte transcription/translation system and bacteria protein expression system that forming a complex with DFF45/ICADL, presumably to allow appropriate protein folding, is a prerequisite for DFF40/CAD to acquire its DNase activity (19Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Benedict M.A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 270-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37450-37454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 30Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13836-13840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In contrast to DFF45/ICADL, DFF35/ICADS seems to be unable to facilitate such conformational changes of DFF40/CAD (30Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Hence, it was thought that DFF40/CAD that binds to DFF35/ICADS or its counterpart would not respond to caspase-3 and exhibit DNase activity. However, our results are inconsistent with this hypothesis. Brain cell extracts that contain almost exclusively the DFF35/ICADS counterpart as the heterodimeric partner of DFF40/CAD displayed a potent DNase activity in the presence of active caspase-3 (Fig. 3). In addition, the purified rat DFF35/ICADS recombinant protein was able to bind to DFF40/CAD and inhibit caspase-3-mediated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The in vitro inhibitory effect of rat DFF35/ICADS was at least as potent as that of DFF45/ICADL (Fig. 3). Moreover, during apoptosis in neuronal PC12 cells where DFF40/CAD complexes predominantly with the short form of ICAD, cleavage of the DFF35/ICADS counterpart was associated with an induced DFF40/CAD activity that resulted in internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and morphological nuclear changes (Fig. 4). Correspondingly, neuron-differentiated PC12 cells that were stably transfected with the caspase-resistant rat DFF35/ICADS mutants exhibited remarkable resistance to apoptotic DNA degradation induced by STS or VP-16 and delayed the cell death significantly (Fig. 4). Hence, the DFF35/ICADScounterpart and the associated DFF40/CAD in these systems are indeed functional. Taken together, these results dispute the contention that DFF45/ICADL is the exclusive molecule that can bind to functional DFF40/CAD, especially in tissues lacking DFF45/ICADL. Although the existence of other chaperone(s) for DFF40/CAD in tissues, such as the brain, cannot be excluded, DFF35/ICADS may serve as such a chaperone under certain conditions. Alternatively, DFF45/ICADLs or other possible molecules in selected tissues may still be the primary chaperones that assist DFF40/CAD for proper folding but are unable to stay in stable association with DFF40/CAD due to rapid degradation (hence the lower expression in these cells). DFF35/ICADS may then substitute for the degraded primary chaperone(s) to bind to the now functional DFF40/CAD and maintain its functional conformation. Consistent with this notion, we found in the in vitro assay that although endogenous DFF40/CAD can be inactivated by exogenous rat DFF35/ICADS, it resumed its DNase activity when the latter was cleaved by caspase-3 (Fig. 3).Although it is known that the ICAD·CAD complex is activated by caspase-3, the precise mechanism by which this complex is processed in apoptotic cells has not yet been fully elucidated. It has been proposed that caspase-3 cleaves DFF45/ICADL and thus releases the bound DFF40/CAD, which is then translocated to the nucleus to execute its activity (17Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 20Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar). However, our current data strongly suggest that DFF40/CAD activation in PC12 cells is a process that takes place in the nucleus and involves the cleavage of nuclear DFF35/ICADS. First, we found that in normal non-apoptotic cells DFF40/CAD was mainly localized in the nucleus in complex with DFF35 and that there was no evidence of further translocation of DFF40/CAD to the nucleus during the course of apoptosis (Fig. 6). Second, the amount of nuclear DFF40/CAD is apparently sufficient to degrade nucleosomal DNA in the presence of active caspase-3, and the depletion of cytosolic DFF40/CAD did not seem to affect this process (Fig. 7). Third, DFF35/ICADS was completely cleaved in the nuclei of apoptotic cells, presumably by activated caspase-3 or -7 translocated into the nuclei (Fig. 6). Finally, the activated form of caspase-3 was indeed found in the apoptotic PC12 cells following STS treatment (Fig. 6), and the time course of caspase translocation coincided with that of the cleavage of nuclear DFF35/ICADS.These results suggest that nuclear translocation of caspase-3 or caspase-7 may constitute an important step in the activation of DFF40/CAD during neuronal apoptosis. This result parallels other nuclear proteins, such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which are also cleaved by caspase-3/-7 early in the process of apoptosis before nuclear degradation. It is unknown, however, whether such nuclear translocation of caspase-3 is a passive and diffusive process as a result of nuclear membrane damage or an active protein-transporting process via the action of a caspase carrier. Nevertheless, nuclear translocation of caspase-3 appears to be dependent on the action of cytosolic components. As determined in the cell-free assay, purified recombinant active caspase-3 (p17) alone was unable to enter the isolated intact nucleus. However, in the presence of cytosolic protein extracts, caspase-3, mainly the p17 active peptide, moved into the nucleus and degraded DFF35/ICADS and other nuclear proteins (Fig. 7). These results suggest that certain cytosolic factor(s) may enable caspase-3 to translocate into the nucleus. Such a cytosolic component could be another caspase that degrades nuclear membrane-bound proteins and, consequently, increases the membrane permeability for macromolecules. Alternatively, it could be a specific caspase-3/-7 carrier bearing nuclear translocation signals. Taken together, our data favor a model in which DFF40/CAD is activated in neuronal apoptosis via a pathway involving nuclear translocation of caspase-3.Multiple factors may be responsible for the apoptotic nuclear events (15Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar, 16Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 24Zhang J. Wang X. Bove K.E.

Nature. 1999; 401: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Whereas DFF40/CAD is important for the small DNA fragmentation at the nucleosomal junction, it also seems to be involved in the nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 5). Whereas nuclear condensation seems to be a process independent of DFF40/CAD, our results suggest that it is still a caspase-dependent event (Fig. 5). These results thus are consistent with the recent report by Sahara et al. (33Sahara S. Aoto M. Eguchi Y. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 401: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) that a distinct caspase-activated factor may be responsible for nuclear condensation in apoptosis. It should be pointed out that DNA fragmentation is a part of the execution of apoptosis but not a factor in determining whether cells will die after a death stimulus. Thus PC12 cells expressing the caspase-resistant DFF35/ICADS showed resistance to DNA fragmentation, but the development of cell death was only delayed, not prevented (Fig. 4). This observation is consistent with the evidence from cells deficient in DFF45 (22Gu J. Dong R.P. Zhang C. McLaughlin D.F. Wu M.X. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20759-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).In summary, a counterpart of DFF35/ICADS has been cloned from the rat brain. This protein is the predominant form of ICAD expressed in the rodent brain and inhibits apoptotic DNase activity of DFF40/CAD by heterodimerization. During neuronal apoptosis, active caspase-3 and/or caspase-7 translocates to the nucleus, cleaves nuclear DFF35/ICADS, and consequently activates DFF40/CAD. Expression of caspase-resistant DFF35/ICADS cDNA constructs can inhibit inter- nucleosomal DNA degradation and nuclear fragmentation and significantly delay the process of cell death in caspase-mediated neuronal apoptosis. These results thus establish that DFF35/ICADS is the endogenous inhibitor of DFF40/CAD in neurons. Apoptosis is a genetically controlled cell suicide program requiring the activation of caspases (1Martin S.J. Green D.R.

Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Inactive DFF40/CAD in non-apoptotic cells is a heterodimeric complex with its natural inhibitor DFF45 (17Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar), also known as ICAD (21Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Further studies in murine cells have found that transcription of the ICAD gene results in not only the previously reported 45-kDa protein (ICADL or DFF45) but also a 35-kDa protein (ICADS or DFF35) due to alternative splicing (20Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2795) Google Scholar, 22Gu J. Dong R.P. Zhang C. McLaughlin D.F. Wu M.X. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20759-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Whereas both DFF45 and DFF35 can bind to DFF40/CAD and share an identical domain (amino acid residues 101–180) (22Gu J. Dong R.P. Zhang C. McLaughlin D.F. Wu M.X. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20759-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), only DFF45 was reported to be functional. DFF45 seems to be important for the proper folding of the newly synthesized DFF40/CAD, and when binding to the latter, it also inhibits the DNase activity of DFF40 (21Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S.

Although the role of DFF35/ICADS is not clear, it appears to possess a stronger ability to bind to DFF40/CAD in vitro than does DFF45/ICADL (22Gu J. Dong R.P. Zhang C. McLaughlin D.F. Wu M.X. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20759-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which suggests that DFF35/ICADS participates in the regulation of DFF40/CAD activity in vivo as well. The activation of CAD involves the cleavage of ICAD, which results in the relief of the inhibition of CAD. ICAD is specifically cleaved by caspase-3 or -7 (25Wolf B.B. Schuler M. Echeverri F.

It has been postulated that caspase-3-mediated ICAD cleavage occurs in the cytosol and that CAD is translocated to the nucleus after it is released from the complex, where it exercises its nuclease"
https://openalex.org/W2063291406,"Escherichia coli sulfite reductase (SiR) is a large and soluble enzyme with an α8β4 quaternary structure. Protein α (or sulfite reductase flavoprotein) contains both FAD and FMN, whereas protein β (or sulfite reductase hemoprotein (SiR-HP)) contains an iron-sulfur cluster coupled to a siroheme. The enzyme is set up to arrange the redox cofactors in a FAD-FMN-Fe4S4-Heme sequence to make an electron pathway between NADPH and sulfite. Whereas α spontaneously polymerizes, we have been able to produce SiR-FP60, a monomeric but fully active truncated version of it, lacking the N-terminal part (Zeghouf, M., Fontecave, M., Macherel, D., and Covès, J.

Pure recombinant SiR-HP behaves as a monomer in solution and is identical to the native protein in all its characteristics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the combination of SiR-FP60 and SiR-HP produces a functional 1:1 complex with tight interactions retaining about 20% of the activity of the native SiR. In addition, fully active SiR can be reconstituted by incubation of the octameric sulfite reductase flavoprotein with recombinant SiR-HP. Titration experiments and spectroscopic properties strongly suggest that the holoenzyme should be described as an α8β8 with equal amounts of α and β subunits and that the α8β4 structure is probably not correct.

NADPH-sulfite reductase sulfite reductase flavoprotein sulfite reductase hemoprotein the monomeric form of sulfite reductase flavoprotein polymerase chain reaction In Escherichia coli, sulfite reductase (SiR)1 catalyzes the transfer of six electrons from NADPH to sulfite to produce sulfide, which then is used during the synthesis of l-cysteine (1Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3474-3484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SiR is a fascinating system not only because of the multielectron transfer reaction that it controls but also because of its complex organization. The enzyme is a 780-kDa soluble complex composed of two proteins, SiR-FP and SiR-HP (2Siegel L.M. Kamin H. Rueger D.C. Presswood R.P. Gibson Q.H. Kamin H. Flavins and Flavoproteins. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1971: 523-553Google Scholar). SiR-FP is a homo-octameric α8flavoprotein (530 kDa), in which each α protein binds one FAD and one FMN and contains a NADPH-binding site (3Siegel L.M. Murphy M.J. Kamin N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 251-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Eschenbrenner M. Covès J. Fontecave M. J. Biol.

SiR-FP thus clearly belongs to a family of proteins that includes NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, nitric oxide synthase, and cytochrome P450 BM-3, which have in common the presence of two flavin-binding domains, one ferredoxin:NADP+-oxidoreductase-like domain for FAD and one flavodoxin-like domain for FMN (6Porter T.D. Kasper C.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1682-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7Porter T.D. Trends Biol. Sci. 1991; 16: 154-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 8Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H.

SiR-HP is a homotetrameric β4 metalloprotein (250 kDa), in which each β protein contains a Fe4S4 cluster linked to a siroheme through a cysteine bridge (3Siegel L.M. Murphy M.J. Kamin N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 251-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Crane B.R. Siegel L.M. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1995; 270: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It has been shown that electrons are transferred from NADPH to FAD and subsequently transferred to FMN in SiR-FP, from which they are transferred to the metal center of SiR-HP, where they serve to reduce siroheme-bound sulfite (11Siegel L.M. Davis P.S. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1572-1586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Crane B.R. Siegel L.M. Getzoff E.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12120-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). With regard to such an electron transfer pathway, the proposed holoenzyme α8β4 quaternary structure is rather intriguing. However, thus far, no three-dimensional structure is available to confirm such a stoichiometry, probably because of the size of the system. Although SiR-FP and SiR-HP interact very strongly to form the α8β4 holoenzyme, they can be separated. However, this requires urea-dependent dissociation of the holoenzyme, which results in significant denaturation of both proteins and the loss of certain prosthetic groups (4Eschenbrenner M. Covès J. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20550-20555Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Siegel L.M. Davis P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When isolated, SiR-FP retains its octameric structure, whereas SiR-HP behaves as a monomer. Such a SiR-HP preparation was successfully crystallized and used to solve SiR-HP three-dimensional structure at 1.6 Å resolution (10Crane B.R. Siegel L.M. Getzoff E.D. Science. 1995; 270: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). SiR-FP has resisted crystallization thus far. However, during our investigation of SiR-FP, we discovered that deletion of the first 51 N-terminal amino acids of the α polypeptide resulted in an α′ protein, which no longer polymerized to an octamer but instead behaved as a monomer in solution (14Zeghouf M. Fontecave M. Macherel D. Covès J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6114-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This observation demonstrated that the N terminus contained all the determinants required for the polymerization. The truncated protein, named SiR-FP60, retained both FAD and FMN as cofactors and displayed all the catalytic diaphorase activities of SiR-FP. SiR-FP60 could be crystallized, and its three-dimensional structure was determined at 1.94 Å resolution (15Gruez A. Pignol D. Zeghouf M. Covès J. Fontecave M. Ferrer J.-L. Fontecilla-Camps J.-C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, whereas we had confirmation that the FAD domain was folded as in ferredoxin:NADP+-oxidoreductase or as in cytochrome P450 reductase, the whole FMN domain remained invisible, most likely as a consequence of a high degree of flexibility. With the objective of obtaining more detailed information on the unique electron transfer pathway in SiR at the molecular level, we have studied the structural and catalytic properties of mixtures of SiR-FP60 and SiR-HP. For that purpose, we have prepared and characterized a recombinant SiR-HP protein. Here we demonstrate that recombinant SiR-HP interacts very tightly and specifically with SiR-FP60 to generate a functional α′β complex that behaves as a simplified version of sulfite reductase, showing that an α8β4structure is not absolutely required. This new complex may prove to be a useful tool to study SiR-HP/SiR-FP interactions and electron transfer reactions as well. NADPH and sodium bisulfite were purchased from Sigma. TEMPO (2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy, free radical) was obtained from Lancaster, and deazaflavin (5-deaza-10-methylisoalloxazine) was synthesized by Dr. J.-L. Decout (Laboratoire de Chimie Bio-organique, Faculté de Pharmacie, Grenoble, France) according to a previously described method (16Yoneda, F., Sakuma, Y., Mizumoto, S., and Ito, R. (1976) J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 1805–1808.Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the purest grade. Plasmid pJYW613 carrying the E. coli B cysJI region, including the cysJIH promoter, plus cysG fromSalmonella typhimurium was purified from the NM522(pJYW613) strain kindly provided by Dr. N. M. Kredich (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) and used as a template for the cloning experiments. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used to generate the construct as described previously (17Covès J. Zeghouf M. Macherel D. Guigliarelli B. Asso M. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5921-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The plasmid pJYW613, encoding for SiR, was used as a template to generate a PCR product corresponding to the cysI gene that encodes for the hemoprotein (β chain). The sense primer, 5′-ACGAATTCATATGAGCATGAGCGAAAAACATCCAGGGCC, was designed to be complementary to the 5′ end of cysI and to incorporate an EcoRI site (italic letters) followed by a NdeI site (underlined) that provides the start codon for the recombinant protein expression. The antisense primer, 5′-CGGGATCCTTAATCCCACAAATCGCGCGCCGGGC, was designed to complement the 3′ end of the cysI gene and to incorporate a BamHI site (italic letters) downstream of the stop codon. The amplification was performed by PCR using the following scheme: 60 s at 94 °C, 90 s at 64 °C and 150 s at 68 °C for 12 cycles. This PCR product was first cloned into vector pET-3a (Novagen) between the NdeI and the BamHI sites, leading to the construct pET-apoHP. Another PCR product corresponding to the cysG gene, encoded for the siroheme synthase, was generated with pJYW613 as a template. The sense primer, 5′-GCGGATCCGGCTGCTGCCAATAATTAAGGGGC, was designed to include the Shine-Dalgarno motif of the cysGgene and the antisense primer, 5′-CGGGATCCTTAATGATTAGAGAACCAATTT, annealed the 3′ end. Both are designed to incorporate a BamHI site (italic letters). The amplification reaction was carried out as described above, except that an annealing temperature of 54 °C was used. The PCR product was cloned in the BamHI site of pET-apoHP, and a ligation product containing the cysG gene in the same orientation as cysI was selected by PCR. This construct, named pET-SiR-HP, allowed for the overproduction of the recombinant SiR-HP used in this study. The authenticity of all PCR products was confirmed by sequencing on both strands (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). SiR (the holoenzyme), SiR-FP (the flavoprotein), and SiR-FP60 (the monomeric form of the flavoprotein) were expressed and purified as described previously (4Eschenbrenner M. Covès J. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20550-20555Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Zeghouf M. Fontecave M. Macherel D. Covès J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6114-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SiR-HP was achieved by using a B834(DE3)pLysS E. coli strain (Novagen) transformed with pET-SiR-HP. The culture was grown for 2 h at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.6 and chilled on ice for 10 min before induction with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3.5 h of incubation at 25 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and soluble extracts were prepared as described previously for SiR-FP (4Eschenbrenner M. Covès J. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20550-20555Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The pellet obtained after ammonium sulfate precipitation (60% final saturation) was dissolved in a minimal volume of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4, buffer A) and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer. The protein solution was loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 onto a Q-Sepharose fast-flow column (2.6 × 9.5 cm; 50 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed at the same flow rate with 100 ml of buffer A, and then elution was performed with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl during a 500-min period. Fractions (4 ml) were collected and analyzed for protein (A 280) and for SiR-HP content (A 389). The SiR-HP-containing fractions, eluting at about 90 mm KCl, were pooled, concentrated using a Diaflo cell equipped with a YM-30 membrane (Amicon Co.), and subjected to filtration on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After concentration to approximately 10 mg ml−1, aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until further use. FMN and FAD content was quantitated by fluorometric analysis (18Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS450 apparatus after extraction from protein samples denatured by boiling for 10 min in the dark. An extinction coefficient of 10.4 mm−1 cm−1at 450 nm was used to quantify the oxidized flavins in SiR-FP60 (14Zeghouf M. Fontecave M. Macherel D. Covès J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6114-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Siroheme content of SiR-HP was determined as reported previously (19Siegel L.M. Murphy M.J. Kamin H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cofactor was extracted with 0.015 N HCl-acetone and rapidly transferred into pyridine (33% final concentration). Then, quantitation was done spectrophotometrically using Δε557–700 = 1.57.104m−1 cm−1. Iron and acid-labile sulfur contents were also quantitated by colorimetric assays as described previously (20Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 78: 248-252Google Scholar, 21Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Measurements were repeated at least three times for each protein sample. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Amino acid composition analysis of SiR-HP was performed by Dr. J. Gagnon (Institut de Biologie Structurale, Grenoble, France) as reported previously (4Eschenbrenner M. Covès J. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20550-20555Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Denatured molecular masses and purity of proteins were estimated by 0.1% SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The native molecular mass of the α′β complex was checked by electrophoresis run under nondenaturing conditions, using a Bio-Rad precast 4–20% polyacrylamide gel. Sulfite reductase activity was monitored spectrophotometrically at 25 °C from the loss of absorbance at 340 nm due to the oxidation of NADPH by sulfite as described previously (24Covès J. Nivière V. Eschenbrenner M. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18604-18609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that all reactions were carried out in a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and initiated by the addition of NADPH. NADPH concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1 cm−1at 340 nm. Blanks in the absence of sulfite in the reaction mixture were systematically run. One enzymatic unit corresponds to the oxidation of 1 nmol NADPH/min. For the determination of apparent dissociation constants, kinetic data were treated as detailed for the tight-binding two-component system (25Climent I. Sjöberg B.M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For these calculations, the amount of the flavoprotein component (SiR-FP60 or SiR-FP) in the system was kept constant to always subtract the same blank obtained in the absence of sulfite (due to the low NADPH oxidase activity of SiR-FP). Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed by Dr I. Jelesarov (Department of Biochemistry, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland) using an OMEGA titration microcalorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA) as described elsewhere (26Jelesarov I. Leder L. Bosshard H.R. Methods. 1996; 9: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). SiR-HP (1.36 ml; 15.7 μm) was titrated with 10 μl of successive additions of SiR-FP60 (280 μm) at 25 °C using Tris-HCl or potassium phosphate as buffer, both at pH 7.4, and I = 0.1. The heat of binding, ΔH, was obtained from the best nonlinear least-square fit of the data, according to a 1:1 binding model, using the data analysis software of the instrument. All data were corrected for the nonspecific heat released during a similar titration of SiR-HP with the respective buffer only. UV-visible spectra of aerobic samples were recorded at 25 °C in a quartz cell (3 or 10 mm light path) using a Cary 1 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer. For recording the absorption spectra of anaerobic samples, a cuvette holder inside a glove box under overpressure of nitrogen was connected with optical fibers to a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. EPR spectra were recorded with a Brucker EMX spectrometer operating at 9.45 GHz and equipped with an ESR 900 helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments). Neutral semiquinone radical on flavin was quantitated as described previously (17Covès J. Zeghouf M. Macherel D. Guigliarelli B. Asso M. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5921-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using TEMPO as a standard. For quantitation, EPR first-derivative spectra of ferriheme or reduced Fe4S4 cluster were recorded at 10 K at a nonsaturating microwave power of 1 milliwatt or 10 microwatts, respectively. 2Unpublished observations. Spin contents were determined either by comparison with the signal of a standard solution of oxidized SiR-HP or by using a 100 μm solution of Cu-EDTA as a standard (27Aasa R. Vänngård T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). All anaerobic experiments were performed in a glove box under nitrogen overpressure and maintained at 17 °C throughout. Photochemical reductions in the presence of deazaflavin-EDTA were achieved in a 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and a 0.3 deazaflavin:protein ratio. Photoreduction of the protein sample was achieved with a slide projector and monitored spectrophotometrically as described previously (14Zeghouf M. Fontecave M. Macherel D. Covès J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6114-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For EPR analysis, 200 μl of protein solution were transferred in 4-mm calibrated EPR tubes. All of them were capped and flash-frozen within the glove box before storage in liquid nitrogen until analysis. From the pJYW613 plasmid containing the cysJIG operon, thecysI gene was cloned as a NdeI-BamHI fragment under the control of the T7 promoter into vector pET-3a. ThecysG gene was cloned downstream of cysI as a BamHI-BamHI fragment containing its own Shine-Dalgarno motif. cysG, encoding for the siroheme synthase, was introduced to achieve optimal incorporation of siroheme into the polypeptide (28Wu J.Y. Siegel L.M. Kredich N.M. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, named pET-SiR-HP, was then used to transform the E. coli B834(DE3)pLysS strain. Maximal expression of soluble SiR-HP was obtained when cells were grown at 25 °C for 2 h after the addition of 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the culture medium. Under these conditions, an intense band at 63 kDa is clearly visible after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed on soluble extracts. However, because a large amount of protein was retained as insoluble material, the yield of recombinant SiR-HP protein was relatively low. After anion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose and filtration on Superdex-75, SiR-HP was obtained in a nearly pure form (more than 95% purity as deduced from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis; data not shown). Typically, 14 mg of that preparation could be obtained from 5 liters of culture. Furthermore, the behavior of the protein on Superdex-75 confirmed that SiR-HP was, in the absence of SiR-FP, a monomer in solution (data not shown). Solutions of SiR-HP are brownish, and their light absorption spectrum displays in the visible region the bands at 389, 590, and 712 nm characteristic for the ferrisiroheme. The spectrum shown in Fig.1 is in perfect agreement with previously reported spectra of native SiR-HP (13Siegel L.M. Davis P.S. J. Biol.

The siroheme content was quantitated spectrophotometrically after extraction with acetone-HCl, as described previously (19Siegel L.M. Murphy M.J. Kamin H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). On the basis of a careful determination of the concentration of the protein by amino acid composition analysis, recombinant SiR-HP was found to contain 0.9 mol siroheme/mol protein. The extinction coefficient at 590 nm was thus estimated at 18.5 mm−1cm−1, in full agreement with that of native SiR-HP (29Siegel L.M. Rueger D.C. Barber M.J. Krueger R.J. Orme-Johnson N.R. Orme-Johnson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6343-6350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, recombinant SiR-HP was found to contain an average of 4.1 mol of iron and 2.7 mol of acid-labile sulfur per mole of protein. After subtraction of the contribution of the siroheme iron, SiR-HP appeared to contain a substoichiometric amount of Fe4S4 clusters (0.7 cluster/protein) and probably contained a small amount of adventitiously bound iron. Fig. 2 A shows the EPR spectrum of the SiR-HP. It exhibits a signal characteristic of a high spin S = 5/2 ferrisiroheme with features atg = 6.65, 5.23, and 1.98, accounting for 0.9 iron/protein. Then, evidence for a cluster came from the EPR spectrum of reduced SiR-HP. After anaerobic reduction with photoreduced deazaflavin in the presence of KCN (to generate a low spinS = 0 ferrosiroheme), the features due to ferrisiroheme were no longer present in the EPR spectrum, and a new signal was observed with g values at 2.04, 1.94, and 1.91, characteristic for a S = 1/2 (Fe4S4)+ cluster (Fig.2 B). The temperature dependence and microwave power saturation properties of this signal are consistent with a (Fe4S4)+ center. Again spin quantitation confirmed the presence of 0.7 cluster/protein. Both spectra in Fig. 2 are similar to those reported previously for native oxidized and reduced SiR-HP (29Siegel L.M. Rueger D.C. Barber M.J. Krueger R.J. Orme-Johnson N.R. Orme-Johnson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6343-6350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Janick P.A. Siegel L.M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3538-3547Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All these results show that recombinant SiR-HP, although slightly depleted in iron sulfur cluster, contains both metal centers (one cluster and one siroheme) and closely resembles the native protein. After incubation of a fixed amount of SiR-HP (β) with increasing amounts of SiR-FP60 (α′), the solution was analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3, a discrete band with an apparent molecular mass of 127 kDa appeared, along with a band corresponding to SiR-FP60 when this protein was in excess in the incubation mixture (lane 5). This is in agreement with the formation of a complex resulting from the association of 1 mol of SiR-HP (theoretical mass, 63,843 Da) with 1 mol of SiR-FP60 (theoretical mass, 60,706 Da). During filtration on Superdex-75, the complex, eluted in the dead volume of the column, could be separated from free SiR-FP60 (data not shown) and analyzed for its spectroscopic properties. Fig. 4 shows the light absorption spectrum of the 1:1 SiR-FP60/SiR-HP complex. The spectrum of SiR-HP (or that of SiR-FP60) could be obtained by subtracting the spectrum of SiR-FP60 (or that of SiR-HP) from the spectrum of Fig. 4 (data not shown). This demonstrated that the tight association of the two proteins did not significantly affect the spectroscopic properties of the redox cofactors and that the spectrum of the complex is just the sum of the light absorption spectra of each of the components. Similarly, the EPR spectrum shown in Fig. 2 A, characteristic for the ferrisiroheme, was not changed during the addition of SiR-FP60 to SiR-HP (data not shown). Furthermore, the spectrum in Fig. 4 is identical to that of the native sulfite reductase holoenzyme (3Siegel L.M. Murphy M.J. Kamin N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 251-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is true for both the position of the absorption bands and their relative intensities. This observation makes the long-agreed proposal that SiR is a α8β4 complex inconsistent. Finally, titration of SiR-HP by SiR-FP60 was followed by microcalorimetry (data not shown). However, this method did not allow us to determine an accurate value for the dissociationK d constant associated with the complex due to the limitations of the method with our experimental conditions,i.e. the release of heat upon binding of the two partners was not high enough to get very precise results. In fact, it showed that this constant was below 20 nm, thus confirming the tight association of the two proteins. Sulfite reductase activity was assayed during oxidation of NADPH by sulfite in the presence of a mixture of SiR-HP and of an excess of the flavoprotein component. The reaction is monitored spectrophotometrically from the decay of the light absorption at 340 nm, characteristic of the oxidation of NADPH. As shown in TableI, the native holoenzyme has a specific activity of 6,500 nmol min−1mg−1 of SiR-HP, in agreement with other reports (4Eschenbrenner M. Covès J. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20550-20555Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Siegel L.M. Davis P.S. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1572-1586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As observed previously (13Siegel L.M. Davis P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1587-1598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible to reconstitute a fully active enzyme by incubating SiR-HP and the octamer SiR-FP (α8) prepared independently (Table I). Now we show that the combination of SiR-HP with the monomeric SiR-FP60 affords an active catalyst for sulfite reduction by NADPH. As shown in Table I, the specific activity accounts for 20% of the native holoenzyme. Fig.5 A shows the dependence of the activity on increasing amounts of SiR-FP60 for various amounts of SiR-HP. The system became saturated with respect to SiR-FP60, and saturation was achieved for larger amounts when the amount of SiR-HP was increased. Fig. 5 B shows a similar experiment, in which the sulfite reductase activity is measured as a function of increasing concentrations of SiR-HP, with a fixed concentration of SiR-FP60. Again, a saturation behavior was observed. From both experiments, one can calculate that a stoichiometric amount of the complementing protein was required for saturation. Furthermore, considering that the rate-limiting step is the electron transfer between SiR-FP and SiR-HP (29Siegel L.M. Rueger D.C. Barber M.J. Krueger R.J. Orme-Johnson N.R. Orme-Johnson W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6343-6350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus assuming that the activity is a function of the concentration of the complex, one can estimate from Fig. 5 Ban apparent K d value of about 10 nm. All these results can thus be explained by a very tight interaction between the two proteins that generates a 1:1 SiR-HP/SiR-FP60 complex.Table IReconstitution of sulfite reductase activityProtein conditionsSpecific activity 1-aSpecific activities are expressed as nmol NADPH oxidized/min−1 mg−1 SiR-HP in the presence of an excess of sulfite and the flavin component of the system, SiR-FP or SiR-FP60. For native SiR, the quantity of SiR-HP was deduced from the published stoichiometry α8β4.Native SiR6500SiR-FP (α8) + SiR-HP (β)6750SiR-FP60 (α′) + SiR-HP (β)12001-a Specific activities are expressed as nmol NADPH oxidized/min−1 mg−1 SiR-HP in the presence of an excess of sulfite and the flavin component of the system, SiR-FP or SiR-FP60. For native SiR, the quantity of SiR-HP was deduced from the published stoichiometry α8β4. Open table in a new tab When the same titration experiments were carried out with SiR-FP (α8) instead of SiR-FP60, saturation with respect to SiR-HP was also observed (data not shown). It appeared that saturation was obtained for a α:β ratio close to 1 rather than 2, suggesting that the holoenzyme SiR is more likely described as an α8β8 complex. Under these conditions, an apparent K d value of about 28 nm has been estimated. One of the confusing features of the complex enzyme system sulfite reductase is the stoichiometry of its quaternary structure. Since 1970, on the basis of analytical ultracentrifugation experiments carried out by L. Siegel and collaborators, it has been accepted without further discussion that SiR has an α8β4structure, with protein α (SiR-FP) carrying flavin prosthetic groups (one FAD and one FMN, as more recently demonstrated), and protein β (SiR-HP) carrying the iron-sulfur/siroheme-coupled center, where reduction of sulfite takes place. Considering the well-established fact that the electrons are shuttled, through FAD, from NADPH to FMN in protein α, it is thus difficult to understand how the electron transfer between FMN in protein α and the metal center in protein β proceeds. Indeed, there is an inconsistency between the proposed linear scheme for the electron transfer pathway (NADPH-FAD-FMN-FeS-siroheme-sulfite) and the above stoichiometry, which suggested that SiR was set up to make two FMNs converge on the same iron-sulfur/siroheme center within an α2β functional unit. Looking at 20 years of reported studies on SiR, we observe that this inconsistency has never been raised. What we now show is that a 1:1 stoichiometric combination of FAD + FMN and of the iron-sulfur/siroheme center is functional, revealing that there is no need for a 2-fold excess of the SiR-FP with regard to SiR-HP. This could be nicely demonstrated by using two original proteins. The first one, named SiR-FP60, is a monomeric form of SiR-FP (protein α′) that can be obtained by deleting the first 51 N-terminal amino acids, as shown previously. SiR-FP60 contains both FAD and FMN and retains both FAD- and FMN-dependent diaphorase activities of SiR-FP. The second one is a recombinant form of SiR-HP, which contains both the Fe4S4 center and the siroheme with spectroscopic properties (light absorption and EPR spectroscopies) similar to those of the corresponding centers in the native SiR. It consists of only one β polypeptide chain. This confirms that, in the absence of protein α, protein β does not polymerize, and the presence of several β polypeptides in SiR is a consequence of protein α polymerization. This had already been shown, but at that time, the experiments were carried out with a slightly denatured SiR-HP preparation obtained from a urea-treated SiR holoenzyme solution. The results reported here demonstrate that SiR-FP60 (α′) and SiR-HP (β) bind tightly to each other to form a 1:1 α′β complex, which is able to catalyze the reduction of sulfite by NADPH. Although the activity is only 20% of the activity of the SiR holoenzyme, this strongly suggests that αβ, and not α2β, is the actual functional unit in SiR, consistent with the proposed linear electron transfer pathway discussed above. It thus follows that the currently proposed α8β4 structure is probably incorrect, and in all probability, SiR is an α8β8 complex, with equal amounts of the α and β components. This is in agreement with our titration experiments carried out with SiR-FP (α8) and recombinant SiR-HP, which best fitted with such a stoichiometry. More direct evidence came from the observation that a 1:1 mixture of SiR-FP60 with SiR-HP gave a light absorption spectrum just superimposable to that of the native enzyme. Because this spectrum contains signatures for the cofactors of both α and β, this result makes totally inconsistent the idea that the native enzyme contains a 2:1 α:β mixture, as is still currently accepted. More experiments are required to further support this new scheme. Nevertheless, it should be noticed that direct determination of the size of SiR might be a difficult project because the native molecular weight of this protein is in the million-Da range. As demonstrated previously in the case of the cytochrome P450 reductase activity of SiR-FP (31Zeghouf M. Defaye G. Fontecave M. Covès J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 246: 602-605Google Scholar), the N-terminal part of this protein seems to play an important role. As indicated above, deletion of the first 51 amino acid residues results in a different quaternary structure of the holoenzyme and in decreased activity. Additional experiments, particularly structural investigations, are required to understand the molecular basis of these effects. Finally, because the SiR-FP60/SiR-HP complex behaves as a simplified version of the SiR system with a much smaller size and retaining both cofactors and enzyme activity, it is an excellent candidate for crystallization and structural studies of the complex electron transfer pathway resulting in the 6-electron reduction of sulfite. SiR and the octameric SiR-FP have resisted crystallization thus far, and the only structural information available is the three-dimensional structure of SiR-HP, on one hand, and, on the other hand, that of SiR-FP60. It should be noted that, unfortunately, the SiR-FP60 crystal structure does not show any electron density related to the FMN binding domain. This disorder was interpreted as a consequence of a functional flexibility of that domain which probably serves to catch SiR-HP to locate the FMN cofactor close to the metal center. Thus, binding of SiR-HP to SiR-FP60 might stabilize the FMN domain, and the structure of the SiR-FP60/SiR-HP complex is expected to both allow determination of the structure of the FMN domain and reveal the molecular details of the NADPH to sulfite electron transfer pathway.

One attractive option is that during adaptation to a subterranean lifestyle, the visual system of this mammal has undergone mosaic reorganization, and the visual pigments have adapted to a function in circadian photoreception. 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid G-protein transducin phosphate-buffered saline 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol Spalax ehrenbergi represents an extreme model of a subterranean rodent, spending all its life in underground darkness with only a few occasional exits aboveground. Consequently, it displays a mosaic of reductional (regressions) and expansional (progressions) adaptation at all organizational levels. This mosaic evolution is most prominent in ocular and brain structures (1Nevo E. Mosaic Evolution of Subterranean Mammals: Regression, Progression, and Global Convergence. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). Thirty million years of adaptation to a subterranean environment and lifestyle has resulted in a natural degeneration of the visual system of mole rats (family Spalacidae). In this process, the eye of Spalax has been reduced to a very small size (≤1 mm) and regressed to a subcutaneous location, embedded in a hypertrophied Harderian gland. Whereas the morphological development of the retina is normal, with a characteristic stratified organization, the anterior eye segments start to degenerate early in development (2Sanyal S. Jansen H.G. de Grip W.J. Nevo E. de Jong W.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1990; 31: 1398-1404PubMed Google Scholar). Neuronal components of the visual pathways are regressed or absent, and anatomically no visual cortex can be identified (3Necker R. Rehkamper G. Nevo E. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Likewise, electrophysiological measurements did not obtain any indication for functional visual pathways (1Nevo E. Mosaic Evolution of Subterranean Mammals: Regression, Progression, and Global Convergence. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar, 4Rehkamper G. Necker R. Nevo E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 347: 570-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, bilateral projections from the retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus have been expanded (5Cooper H.M. Herbin M. Nevo E. Nature. 1993; 361: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), andSpalax has preserved the ability to entrain its biological clock to environmental light cues (6David-Gray Z.K. Janssen J.W.H. Nevo E. DeGrip W.J. Foster R.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 655-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Removal of the eyes abolishes circadian photoentrainment (7Pévet P. Heth G. Haim A. Nevo E. J. Exp. Zool. 1984; 232: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the circadian photoreceptor system is located in the eye. Despite the degenerate nature of its visual system, Spalax has retained a well organized retina that expresses both a rod-like and a cone-like visual pigment. Recently a green cone-like visual pigment was cloned from Spalax and spectrally identified via functional expression (6David-Gray Z.K. Janssen J.W.H. Nevo E. DeGrip W.J. Foster R.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 655-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but to date only immunohistochemical evidence for the presence of a rod-like pigment has been presented (2Sanyal S. Jansen H.G. de Grip W.J. Nevo E. de Jong W.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1990; 31: 1398-1404PubMed Google Scholar, 8DeGrip W.J. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Signal Transduction in Photoreceptor Cells. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 42-59Crossref Google Scholar). Here we present an extensive characterization of this pigment. Its sequence is characteristic for a rod visual pigment and has retained very high homology with rod pigments of sighted mammals. Through functional expression with recombinant baculovirus we provide ample biochemical evidence that this pigment behaves like a fully functional rod pigment. Considering the absence of any visual ability, a possible novel function for the visual pigments of Spalax is discussed. Total RNA was isolated from Spalax eyes using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and approximately 2 μg of RNA was used to synthesize cDNA by means of reverse transcription (Superscript II reverse transcriptase; Life Technologies, Inc.). polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed using Pfu proofreading polymerase (Stratagene) in combination with degenerate nested and/or specific rod opsin primers. The degenerate and specific primers, respectively, were as follows: degenerate forward, 5′-GTG-RTS-TGY-AAR-CCB-3′ (exon II) and 5′-AAT-GTC-GAC-CAY-GCY-ATC-ATG-GTY-3′ (exon II, nested); degenerate reverse, 5′-RTA-RAT-SAY-VGG-RTT-3′ (exon IV) and 5′-AAT-GTC-GAC-GCC-CTG-RTG-GGT-GAA-3′ (exon IV, nested); specific forward, 5′-ATG-AAC-GGC-ACA-GAG-GG-3′ (exon I); and specific reverse, 5′-CAT-CAC-CCA-GGA-GGT-TCT-TGC-3′ (exon V). 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends were performed using a 5′/3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in combination with an opsin-specific reverse primer in exon I (5′-AAG-TTG-AGC-AGG-ATG-TAG-3′) and the above-mentioned forward-nested degenerate rod opsin primer in exon II, respectively. The obtained full-length open reading frame was checked on the genomic level by means of the expanded long template polymerase chain reaction system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using 500 ng of genomic DNA and a rod opsin-specific primer (5′-TCT-ACG-TGC-CCT-TCT-CCA-ACG-3′) in exon I in combination with the above-mentioned specific rod opsin reverse primer in exon V. The obtained partial sequence was identical to the corresponding cDNA sequence. A forward primer with aBamHI site (5′-GGC-GGG-ATC-CAT-GAA-CGG-CA-3′) and a reverse primer containing a NarI site (5′-TTA-GGC-CGG-CGC-CAC-CTG-G-3′) were used in combination with the Pfu proofreading polymerase to clone theSpalax rod opsin cDNA in a baculovirus transfer vector modified from pFastbacdual (Life Technologies, Inc.). This modified transfer vector contains a BamHI site and a NarI site in frame with the remaining 3′ part of the Spalax rod opsin sequence extended with an oligonucleotide coding for 6 histidines (His-tag). The transfer vector containing the His-tagged Spalax rod opsin cDNA was used to generate recombinant baculovirus in a Spodoptera frugiperda-derived cell line (IPLB-Sf9) using the Bac-to-bac system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. Generation and amplification of the recombinant baculovirus was performed in a monolayer of Sf9 cells, cultured in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For expression of recombinant protein (9Klaassen C.H.W. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. DeCaluwé G.L.J. DeGrip W.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) Sf9 cells were adapted to suspension culture in 250-ml spinner flasks (Bellco) in serum-free InsectXpress medium (Biowhittaker), infected in mid log phase with a multiplicity of infection of 0.1, and finally harvested 5 days post-infection. At 5 days post-infection the infected Sf9 cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min; 1000 × g at 26 °C) and resuspended at a concentration of 108 cells/ml in buffer A (6 mmPipes,1 10 mmEDTA, pH 6.5), supplemented with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. The suspension was homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and centrifuged (10 min; 40,000 ×g at 4 °C). The pellet containing the cellular membranes was resuspended at a concentration equivalent to 108cells/ml in buffer B (20 mm Pipes, 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 6.5). All subsequent manipulations are performed under deep red light (Schott R630 longpass filter). Regeneration of the recombinant Spalax opsin into rhodopsin was performed under argon by addition of a concentrated 11-cis retinal solution in dimethylformamide to the membrane suspension in an amount of 10 nmol/108 cells. The mixture was incubated under continuous rotation for 30 min at room temperature followed by 1 h at 4 °C. To extract the rhodopsin from the membranesN-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and the resulting mixture was incubated for 1 h under argon with continuous rotation at 4 °C. After centrifugation (30 min; 120,000 × g at 4 °C) the supernatant was diluted 1:1 with buffer C (20 mm bis-Tris propane, 0.5 m NaCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm histidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 mm N-nonyl-β-d-glucoside, pH 7.0). The solubilized pigment was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography over Ni2+ nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) in a slight modification from previously described procedures (9Klaassen C.H.W. Bovee-Geurts P.H.M. DeCaluwé G.L.J. DeGrip W.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Janssen J.J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Merkx M. DeGrip W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11222-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Prior to purification the pigment concentration in the extract was determined by UV-visible difference spectroscopy (10Janssen J.J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Merkx M. DeGrip W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11222-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the pH value was raised to 7.0–7.2 by addition of several aliquots of 200 mm unbuffered bis-Tris propane solution. The Ni2+ nitrilotriacetic acid resin (25–30 μl of resin/nmol of pigment) was washed with 10 volumes of distilled water and buffer C, respectively. The protein extract was then applied to the column and washed with approximately 10 column volumes of buffer C followed by approximately 10 column volumes of a linear gradient prepared from buffers C and D (buffer D, buffer C with the histidine concentration raised to 5 mm and containing 20 mm N-nonyl-β-d-glucoside). Elution was accomplished using buffer E (20 mm bis-Tris propane, 140 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol (v/v), 20 mm N-nonyl-β-d-glucoside, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm histidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 6.5). Fractions were screened by UV-visible spectroscopy, and those containing over 0.5 nmol of rhodopsin/ml were combined. To reconstitute the purified pigment into a lipid membrane (proteoliposomes) a 100-fold molar excess of bovine retina lipids in buffer F (20 mm Pipes, 130 mm NaCl, 15 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 6.5) supplemented with 20 mm N-nonyl-β-d-glucoside and 1 mmdithioerythritol was added to the combined rhodopsin fractions. Preparation of bovine retina lipids and removal of the detergent through addition of β-cyclodextrin to a final concentration of 20 mm were performed as described before (11DeGrip W.J. VanOostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Purification of the proteoliposomes containing the reconstituted pigment was accomplished on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (10, 20, and 45% sucrose (w/w)) in buffer F (11DeGrip W.J. VanOostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After 16 h of centrifugation at 120,000 × g and 4 °C the pigment containing proteoliposomes were isolated from the 20–45% interface and diluted with 4 volumes of buffer B. The membranes were then pelleted (200,000 × g, 30 min at 4 °C) and stored at −80 °C in light-tight containers. For spectral analysis of the pigment a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 15 spectrophotometer was used with the cuvette house thermostrated at 10 °C. Membrane samples were used for analysis of the slow photocascade transitions (rhodopsin → meta II → meta III) as described before (12Delange F. Merkx M. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Pistorius A.M. DeGrip W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Absorbance spectra were measured after solubilization in buffer B containing 20 mm N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The samples were supplemented with hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 20 mm and were measured before and after illumination with a 75-watt light bulb. Difference spectra were obtained by subtraction of the “dark” from the “illuminated” spectrum. Activation of the bovine G-protein transducin (Gt) by the Spalax rod pigment was measured by the intrinsic fluorescence enhancement of the G-protein α subunit upon GTP binding (13Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9165-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Native bovine rhodopsin or reconstituted pigment samples (∼20 μl) of recombinant His-taggedSpalax or bovine rhodopsin (final concentration of 5 nm) were added under illumination to a stirred cuvette containing, in a final volume of 2 ml, 100 nm bovine transducin, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 0.01% (w/v)N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4. The sample fluorescence was measured using a Shimadzu RF—5301–PC spectrofluorometer with excitation at 295 nm and emission at 337 nm, and after a stabilization period of 200 s, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) was added to a final concentration of 2.5 μm. The subsequent increase in relative fluorescence intensity represents pigment-triggered activation of Gtα. The same assay in the absence of pigment was used as a negative control. Constitutive activity of the apoprotein opsin was assayed in the same way, except that the pigment samples were illuminated in the presence of 50 mm hydroxylamine to convert photointermediates and retinal into opsin and retinaloxime before they were added to the transducin solution. To measure any dark activity of the pigment, the fluorescence enhancement assay was used, as well, but was modified as follows: about 25 ml of a solution containing dark pigment, transducin, and the other compounds in the same composition as given above was prepared under deep red light. Guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) was then added to a final concentration of 2.5 μm, and at subsequent 10-min intervals 2-ml samples were withdrawn. After 80–90 min the remaining solution was illuminated, and subsequently 2-ml samples were taken every minute to measure the light activation level. Every 2-ml sample was provided immediately with 50 μl of 1m hydroxylamine (pH 7.5) and 50 μl of 25 mm N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside to quench any ongoing and latent G-protein activation activity. Control experiments showed that under these conditions G-protein activation by light-activated rhodopsin is quenched below 1% its normal rate. The samples were illuminated, and their fluorescence level was measured as described above for the continuous assay. This level was stable for at least 4 min. Spalax eyes were isolated from dark-adapted animals and the retina was excised and mounted between coverslips in the microscope, and potential outer segment material was identified under infrared illumination. The spectral transmission of the photoreceptor outer segments was scanned using a 2-μm diameter beam of monochromatic light over the wavelength range of 350 to 750 nm (14Dartnall H.J. Bowmaker J.K. Mollon J.D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1983; 220: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This resulted in the dark spectrum. Following a 3-min exposure to white light this procedure was repeated to establish whether the pigment is photosensitive. The dark spectrum was fitted with standard Dartnall templates for a vitamin A1-based visual pigment (14Dartnall H.J. Bowmaker J.K. Mollon J.D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1983; 220: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies CERN886 against rhodopsin and CERN9412 against Gtα were described previously (15Foster R.G. Garcı́a-Fernández J.M. Provencio I. DeGrip W.J. J. Comp. Physiol. A Sens. Neural. Behav. Physiol. 1993; 172: 33-45Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against rhodopsin (1D4) or against Gtα were obtained from R. S. Molday (16Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and A. M. Spiegel (17Spiegel A.M. Nahorski S.R. Transmembrane Signalling, Intracellular Messengers, and Implications for Drug Development. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, UK1990: 31-41Google Scholar), respectively. Spalax occular tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS and mouse ocular tissue in Bouin fixative (3 volumes saturated picrine acid, 1 volume 37% formaldehyde, and 0.2 volume of acetic acid). Paraffin-embedded 4-μm sections were used for antibody incubations and hematoxylin/eosin staining. Spalax and mouse ocular tissue were incubated according to standard procedures with 1D4 or anti-Gtα (dilutions 1:50 and 1:100 in PBS/10% fetal calf serum, respectively) and with CERN886 or CERN9412 (dilutions 1:100 and 1:500 in PBS/10% fetal calf serum, respectively). Bound antibody was visualized by incubation with a fluorescent second antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-rabit anti-mouse (DAKO) for 1D4 and anti-Gtα, fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-rabbit (DAKO) for CERN886 and CERN9412; dilutions 1:50 in PBS/10% fetal calf serum). Coverslips were mounted using a ProLong anti-fade kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. To clone the rod pigment from Spalaxretina we conducted RT polymerase chain reaction and 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends on total ocular RNA using degenerate and rhodopsin-specific primers. The amino acid sequence deduced from the full-length cDNA displays a very high similarity with other mammalian rhodopsins (91–95%), and all elements essential for a functional visual pigment are conserved (Fig. 1).Figure 1Multiple sequence alignment of the amino acid sequence of Spalax, rat, and mouse rhodopsin. The nucleotide sequence of Spalax rhodopsin cDNA contains an open reading frame that codes for 348 amino acid proteins and shares approximately 95% similarity with other rodent rhodopsins like rat and mouse. The amino acid substitutions in Spalax compared with rat (16 in total) and mouse (19 in total) rhodopsin areboxed. Note (arrows) the presence inSpalax of the over all vertebrate visual pigments fully conserved residues Lys-296 (11-cis retinal binding), Glu-113 (counterion), and Cys-110 and Cys-187 (disulfide bridge). Thefifth arrow indicates the Glu residue at position 122, highly characteristic for rod visual pigments. The Spalaxsequence is available under GenBand™ acession numberAF309568.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To establish whether the isolated cDNA encodes for a functional rod pigment we extended the cDNA C-terminally with a 6× His-tag to allow easy purification and expressed it using the baculovirus system. After regeneration with the chromophore, 11-cis retinal, purification was accomplished using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (10Janssen J.J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Merkx M. DeGrip W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11222-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This yields a purified protein that has an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa (Fig. 2) and an absorbance spectrum with a peak spectral activity of 497 ± 2 nm (Fig. 3). As expected, the spectral properties are very similar to those of rod pigments in sighted animals, because all known spectral tuning sites (18Neitz M. Neitz J. Backhaus W. Kriegl R. Color Vision Perspectives from Different Disciplines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1998: 101-119Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have been conserved inSpalax. However, immunoblots of Spalax eye extracts suggest a higher molecular mass of ∼43 kDa (Fig. 2). Because the protein component of the Spalax and bovine rod pigments are very similar (39 kDa), and the recombinant pigments display the same molecular mass (Fig. 2), most likely the native Spalaxpigment contains larger oligosaccharide moieties on its twoN-glycosylation sites, which will reduce its electrophoretic mobility. The very small Spalax eye only contains minute amounts of rhodopsin (∼5 pmol (8DeGrip W.J. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Signal Transduction in Photoreceptor Cells. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 42-59Crossref Google Scholar)), which so far has prohibited isolation and structural characterization of the native protein.Figure 3Spectral properties of purified reconstitutedSpalax rhodopsin. The photopigment displays a peak spectral activity at 497 ± 2 nm. TheA280/A500 ratio is approximately 3.5. This is higher then for purified rod pigments (1.7–2.0) because of the excess of lipid that contributes to the UV absorbance. The inset shows the difference spectrum, obtained by subtracting the dark spectrum from the spectrum after illumination. The spectra were measured in the presence of 20 mm hydroxylamine to convert the liberated all-trans retinal into all-trans retinoxime with an absorbance maximum at 365 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To study the pigment's photocascade and receptor activity in a native-like environment, we reconstituted the pigment into proteoliposomes of bovine retina lipids (11DeGrip W.J. VanOostrum J. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The reconstitutedSpalax rhodopsin displays typical rod pigment photochemical behavior (pKa of meta I/meta II equilibrium of 6.5; half-time of meta II decay of 15 ± 3 min at 10 °C).Spalax is very similar to the human rod pigment in this respect (19Lewis J.W. van Kuijk F.J. Thorgeirsson T.E. Kliger D.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11372-11376Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Note that the decay of meta II is typically much faster in cone pigments (t12 < 3 min (20Vissers P.M. Bovee-Geurts P.H. Portier M.D. Klaassen C.H. DeGrip W.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). The structural transitions accompanying receptor activation were probed by fourier transform-infared difference spectroscopy and were found to be almost identical to recombinant His-tagged bovine rhodopsin (not shown). This already implies that the Spalax rod pigment should be able to activate the rod G-protein transducin. Indeed, in anin vitro assay (13Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9165-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) it achieves a light-induced activation rate very similar to that of native and of recombinant bovine rhodopsin (see Fig. 4 and TableI). The dark activity of theSpalax pigment is very low, and the constitutive activity of the apoprotein opsin is quite low, as well (Table I), very similar to the properties reported for bovine rhodopsin (Table I) (13Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9165-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that in vitro the Spalax rod photopigment behaves as a fully functional visual pigment.Table ITransducin (Gt) activation by Spalax rhodopsin relative to bovine rhodopsinPreparationConditionInitial rateRecombinant his-tagged bovine rhodopsindark0.01 ± 0.01light0.97 ± 0.05Recombinant his-taggedSpalax rhodopsindark0.01 ± 0.01light0.95 ± 0.06Recombinant his-taggedSpalax opsinN.A.0.05 ± 0.03The light-dependent initial activation rate measured for native bovine rhodopsin was set at 1 (see Fig. 4). n = 3–5.

Do we have evidence for a functional pigment in vivo? Both 11-cis retinal (8DeGrip W.J. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Kaupp U.B. Signal Transduction in Photoreceptor Cells. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992: 42-59Crossref Google Scholar) and a functional interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (21Springer M.S. Burk A. Kavanagh J.R. Waddell V.G. Stanhope M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13754-13759Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have been identified in Spalax retina, suggesting a functional visual cycle. Therefore, we attempted to identify a photopigment in vivoby means of microspectrophotometry. Despite a much lower degree of organization of Spalax photoreceptor outer segments we managed to determine the spectral absorbance of several outer segments in retinas isolated from dark-adapted animals (Fig. 5). The corresponding pigment is photosensitive, and its absorbance curve obeys the Dartnall standard template for a vitamin A1-based visual pigment (14Dartnall H.J. Bowmaker J.K. Mollon J.D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1983; 220: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The dashed curve (Fig. 5) represents a template with a peak absorbance at 497 nm, as determined for the recombinant pigment. This template fit is not optimal, which could be because of the noise level in the spectral data or might indicate that in vivo the absorbance of the pigment is slightly shifted to the red. Such small discrepancies between spectral data of native and recombinant pigments have been observed before (18Neitz M. Neitz J. Backhaus W. Kriegl R. Color Vision Perspectives from Different Disciplines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1998: 101-119Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the close agreement of the in vivo spectrum with our in vitro data strongly argues that the Spalax retina contains a photoactive rod pigment. A functional visual pigment requires co-localization with the rod Gt. To address that question, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of Spalax retina with anti-rhodopsin and anti-Gtα antibodies. We observed abundant expression of rod pigment in Spalax photoreceptor outer segments and clear staining of inner segments and the outer nuclear layer (Fig. 6 C). This is similar to the picture obtained for mice (Fig. 6 D). Gtα expression was observed in Spalax but only in the outer segment layer (Fig. 6 E) in contrast to mouse where Gtα is detected throughout the entire photoreceptor cell (Fig. 6 F). This could be because of a lower avidity of the antiserum for Spalax Gtα. However, the same pattern was observed with different dilutions of the antiserum and with the monoclonal anti-Gtα antibody raised against a highly conserved sequence of Gtα (17Spiegel A.M. Nahorski S.R. Transmembrane Signalling, Intracellular Messengers, and Implications for Drug Development. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, UK1990: 31-41Google Scholar). Rather this suggests that in Spalax the expression level of Gtα relative to rhodopsin is lower as compared with mouse. This might be related to the subterranean environment of the mole rat. For instance, to guarantee maximal photon capture under the very low light intensities experienced by Spalax, the high expression level of visual pigment, typical for sighted animals, should be maintained. Nevertheless, the level of activated pigment will be very low, and signal transduction should be able to operate with much lower Gt levels than in sighted animals. Considering ourin vitro data (spectral properties and full activation of Gt) and the in vivo evidence for the same photosensitive pigment co-localized with Gtα, we conclude that the Spalax rod visual pigment is functional in vivo and uses the same photocascade as sighted animals. Although visual pigments have been identified before in blind animals like the cave fish Astyanax (22Yokoyama S. Meany A. Wilkens H. Yokoyama R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and crayfish (23Crandall K.A. Hillis D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 667-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we here report the first extensive functional characterization of a visual pigment in a blind mammal. In other blind animals loss of sight seems to be accompanied by deficiencies in gene expression or pigment functionality (22Yokoyama S. Meany A. Wilkens H. Yokoyama R. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 23Crandall K.A. Hillis D.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 667-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Archer, S. N., Djamgoz, M. B. A., Loew, E. R., Partrideg, J. C., and Vallerga, S. (eds) (1999) Adaptive Mechanisms in the Ecology of Vision, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The NetherlandsGoogle Scholar). In contrast, the rod visual pigment of the blind mole rat we have cloned is highly conserved and exhibits full functionality. A major question then is why a blind mammal, despite mosaic reorganization of visual structures to an auditory function (1Nevo E. Mosaic Evolution of Subterranean Mammals: Regression, Progression, and Global Convergence. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar, 3Necker R. Rehkamper G. Nevo E. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Cooper H.M. Herbin M. Nevo E. Nature. 1993; 361: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), has retained a fully functional visual pigment? The subcutaneous location of the eye and the complete degeneration of the lens (2Sanyal S. Jansen H.G. de Grip W.J. Nevo E. de Jong W.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1990; 31: 1398-1404PubMed Google Scholar) already abolish any capacity of the retina to transfer image information. In fact, all available evidence, based upon anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral studies, convincingly shows that the visual pathways in Spalax have almost fully regressed and do not retain any detectable function (1Nevo E. Mosaic Evolution of Subterranean Mammals: Regression, Progression, and Global Convergence. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar, 3Necker R. Rehkamper G. Nevo E. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Rehkamper G. Necker R. Nevo E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 347: 570-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Cooper H.M.

Ocular regression to a subcutaneously embedded atrophic eye and degeneration of the visual system is a logical consequence of adaptation to a subterranean environment where visual cues are reduced. However, negative selection upon the neuronal components of the visual system was accompanied by positive selection pressures resulting in maintenance of retinal morphology and expansion of bilateral projections to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. This pathway is responsible for mediating circadian photoentrainment (1Nevo E. Mosaic Evolution of Subterranean Mammals: Regression, Progression, and Global Convergence. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar, 4Rehkamper G. Necker R. Nevo E. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 347: 570-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Cooper H.M. Herbin M. Nevo E. Nature. 1993; 361: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and, similar to sighted mammals, removal of the eyes completely abolishes photoentrainment in Spalax. In sighted mammals the photoreceptors that mediate photoregulation of the circadian system still remain uncharacterized. Data obtained from mouse models like rd/rd andrdta/rdta (25Lupi D. Cooper H.M. Froehlich A. Standford L. McCall M.A. Foster R.G. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Foster R.G. Provencio I. Hudson D. Fiske S. De Grip W. Menaker M. J. Comp. Physiol. A Sens. Neural. Behav. Physiol. 1991; 169: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 27Freedman M.S. Lucas R.J. Soni B. von Schantz M. Munoz M. David-Gray Z.K. Foster R.G. Science. 1999; 284: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) suggest that neither rods nor cones are directly required for photoentrainment but that the mouse retina contains a novel type of circadian photoreceptor(s), not located in the photoreceptor layer. However, the circadian system in sighted animals is not very photosensitive (28Groos G. Experientia ( Basel ). 1982; 38: 929-1128Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Nelson D.E. Takahashi J.S. J. Physiol. ( London ). 1991; 439: 115-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and may not function properly in combination with a subterranean lifestyle. Hence, the crucial question in our opinion is as follows: did Spalaxmaintain a photoreceptor cell layer and functional visual photopigments basically to preserve circadian photoreception? In fact, in blind animals like Spalax, maintenance of visual photoreceptors without any physiological importance would go with high metabolic costs and appear to contradict evolutionary laws (1Nevo E. Mosaic Evolution of Subterranean Mammals: Regression, Progression, and Global Convergence. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). Considering such admittedly circumstantial evidence we propose thatSpalax, in its adaptation to a blind subterranean life, has rewired its retinal circuitry to maintain circadian photoentrainment under conditions where light cues are sparse and of low intensity. In this view, extensive deprivation of light because of a subterranean ecotope and the subcutaneous location of the eyes have expanded mosaic reorganization in Spalax to complement its “traditional” non-visual photoreceptor circadian system with the much more abundant and much more sensitive visual photoreceptor system, which could be diverted from its original function. This demanded that the full integrity of the retinal morphology be maintained but without the need for an optical focusing system (cornea and lens). Direct evidence for this hypothesis unfortunately is very hard to provide. TheSpalax underground ecotope cannot very well be mimicked, and animals do not breed in captivity. Hence, recombinant DNA technology that could lead to identification of circadian pigment(s) (e.g. mutagenic screens and gene targeting) is not currently available for Spalax. Determination of sufficiently accurate action spectra for the circadian photoresponses in Spalax to provide unequivocal evidence for the involvement of visual pigments is also not a feasible task (6David-Gray Z.K. Janssen J.W.H. Nevo E. DeGrip W.J. Foster R.G. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 655-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, another circumstantial argument can be put forward. The degenerate eye of Spalax shares several characteristics with the pineal organ of non-mammalian vertebrates. Both lack a focusing lens, are located subcutaneously, and exhibit a much lower degree of organization of the outer segments of the photoreceptor cells than observed for visual photoreceptors (28Groos G. Experientia ( Basel ). 1982; 38: 929-1128Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Foster R.G. Korf H.W. Schalken J.J.

The pineal photoreceptors also contain rod-like, as well as cone-like, photopigments (31Vı́gh B. Röhlich P. Görcs T. Manzano e Silva M.J. Szél A. Fejér Z. Vı́gh-Teichmann I. Biol.

Res. 1997; 30: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We present the first extensive characterization of a visual pigment cloned from a blind animal, the mole rat Spalax ehrenbergi. In view of its high homology to rod pigments of sighted animals and the functional properties of the corresponding recombinant protein, this pigment represents the rod visual pigment ofSpalax. We provide evidence that the rod photoreceptor cell of Spalax, despite the strongly regressed state of the eye, still contains the primary elements required for a role as a functional photoreceptor. In view of the striking evolutionary conservation and the in vitro and in vivo functionality of theSpalax rod visual pigment we propose that during evolutionary adaptation to a predominantly subterranean lifestyle the visual photoreceptor system in this blind mammal has been reprogrammed to play a major role in photoperiodic entrainment. Extrapolating this to sighted animals, one could argue that this might imply some yet unidentified role, e.g. developmental or regulatory, of the visual system in circadian photoentrainment in general. This might explain, for instance, why early ablation of photoreceptors during retinal development changes the photosensitivity of the circadian system (25Lupi D. Cooper H.M. Froehlich A. Standford L. McCall M.A. Foster R.G. Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)."

We have used a fluorescent derivative of meizothrombin des fragment 1 (mIIaΔF1) as a substrate analog to assess the mechanism of substrate recognition in the second half-reaction of bovine prothrombin activation. Cleavage of mIIaΔF1 exhibits pseudo-first order kinetics regardless of the substrate concentration relative to Km. This phenomenon arises from competitive product inhibition by thrombin, which binds to prothrombinase with exactly the same affinity as mIIaΔF1. As thrombin is known to bind to an exosite on prothrombinase, initial interactions at an exosite likely play a role in the enzyme-substrate interaction. Occupation of the active site of prothrombinase by a reversible inhibitor does not exclude the binding of mIIaΔF1 to the enzyme. Specific recognition of mIIaΔF1 is achieved through an initial bimolecular reaction with an enzymic exosite, followed by an active site docking step in an intramolecular reaction prior to bond cleavage. By alternate substrate studies, we have resolved the contributions of the individual binding steps to substrate affinity and catalysis. This pathway for substrate binding is identical to that previously determined with a substrate analog for the first half-reaction of prothrombin activation. We show that differences in the observed kinetic constants for the two cleavage reactions arise entirely from differences in the inferred equilibrium constant for the intramolecular binding step that permits elements surrounding the scissile bond to dock at the active site of prothrombinase. Therefore, substrate specificity is achieved by binding interactions with an enzymic exosite that tethers the protein substrate to prothrombinase and directs cleavage at two spatially distinct scissile bonds.

Therefore, substrate specificity is achieved by binding interactions with an enzymic exosite that tethers the protein substrate to prothrombinase and directs cleavage at two spatially distinct scissile bonds. meizothrombin acetothioacetyl adduct of FPR-CH2Cl dansyl-l-glutamyl-glycyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone 1,5-dimethylaminonaphthalene sulfonyl d-phenylalanyl-l-phenyl-alanyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone thrombin inactivated with FPR-CH2Cl meizothrombin des fragment 1 mIIaΔF1 inactivated with DEGR-CH2Cl mIIaΔF1 inactivated with ATA-FPR-CH2Cl and modified with 6-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein following thioester hydrolysis mIIaΔF1 inactivated with FPR-CH2Cl H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginylp-nitroanilide methoxycarbonyl-d-cyclohexylglycyl-glycyl-l-arginylp-nitroanilide 4-aminobenzamidine small unilamellar vesicles composed of 75% (w/w) phosphatidylcholine and 25% (w/w) phosphatidylserine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Prothrombinase is an archetypal enzyme complex of blood coagulation (2Mann K.G.

The enzyme complex assembles through well characterized, reversible, protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions between the serine protease, factor Xa, the cofactor, factor Va, and membranes in the presence of calcium ions (2Mann K.G.

Chem. 1975; 250: 8897-8906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by prothrombinase proceeds almost exclusively via the initial cleavage at Arg323-Ile324, yielding meizothrombin as an intermediate, followed by cleavage at Arg274-Thr275 to yield the final products of the reaction (7Krishnaswamy S.

Single turnover kinetic studies indicate that the overall process is likely the sum of two consecutive enzyme-catalyzed reactions (8Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, steady state kinetic constants derived from measurements of the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin are difficult to interpret and are unlikely to provide valid mechanistic insights into this process. This problem can be circumvented by the use of proteolytic derivatives of prothrombin as analog substrates for the individual half-reactions of prothrombin activation (8Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 22044-22055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Prethrombin 2, generated by preparative cleavage at Arg274-Thr275, has been shown to be a valid substrate analog for kinetic studies of the cleavage at Arg323-Ile324, which represents the first cleavage reaction in the activation of prothrombin by prothrombinase (8Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Prior cleavage at Arg274-Thr275 was shown to have no effect on the recognition and cleavage of the Arg323-Ile324 site by prothrombinase (8Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considerable advances in the understanding of substrate-prothrombinase interactions have been gained by studies with prethrombin 2 in the bovine system (12Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The results support a model in which the substrate, prethrombin 2, binds to prothrombinase via a multistep reaction (13Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The affinity of the enzyme for the substrate is determined by a bimolecular reaction between prethrombin 2 and extended macromolecular recognition sites (exosites) on the enzyme complex. This step is followed by interactions between elements surrounding the scissile bond with the active site of the enzyme followed by bond cleavage. The resulting product, thrombin, remains bound to the exosite and requires dissociation for subsequent rounds of catalysis. Since active site interactions between substrate and enzyme were found to be unfavorable, it has been suggested that binding specificity for cleavage at Arg323-Ile324 is largely determined by exosite interactions with the enzyme (13Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Comparable information on the second half-reaction, in which the Arg274-Thr275 peptide bond is cleaved by prothrombinase, is lacking. Although prior cleavage at Arg274-Thr275 does not influence the kinetics of cleavage at Arg323-Ile324, the reverse is not true (8Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial cleavage at Arg323-Ile324has been suggested to enhance the rate of cleavage at Arg274-Thr275 by a factor of ∼10 (11Carlisle T.L. Bock P.E. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22044-22055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of cleavage at Arg274-Thr275, which converts meizothrombin to thrombin, is only modestly stimulated by factor Va (9Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5386-5391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structural models based on x-ray diffraction studies indicate that the two cleavage sites in prothrombin are spatially distinct and separated by as much as 36 Å (16Martin P.D. Malkowski M.G. Box J. Esmon C.T. Edwards B.F. Structure. 1997; 5: 1681-1693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Finally, rapid kinetic studies support the possibility that the two cleavage reactions catalyzed by prothrombinase derive from two distinct types of substrate-enzyme interactions (8Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that there may be significant differences in the mechanisms underlying the recognition and cleavage of the two bonds in prothrombin by prothrombinase.Meizothrombin (mIIa),2produced as the intermediate of prothrombin activation by prothrombinase following initial cleavage at Arg323-Ile324, is the relevant substrate analog for kinetic studies of the action of prothrombinase on the Arg274-Thr275 cleavage site (8Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5386-5391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Single turnover kinetic studies have established that proteolytic removal of the membrane-binding fragment 1 domain from mIIa to yield meizothrombin des fragment 1 (mIIaΔF1) does not affect the kinetics of substrate recognition and cleavage by prothrombinase (8Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although mIIa can bind membranes (18Armstrong S.A. Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6210-6218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pei G. Laue T.M. Aulabaugh A. Fowlkes D.M. Lentz B.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6990-6996Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), this interaction does not play an obvious enhancing role in its ability to be recognized and cleaved by prothrombinase. Therefore, mIIaΔF1 is a valid substrate analog for the second half-reaction of prothrombin activation that permits studies of the enzyme-substrate interaction in the absence of the obscuring effects of membrane-mediated substrate delivery steps (8Walker R.K. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27441-27450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nelsestuen G.L. Martinez M.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9081-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Lu Y. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8201-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have therefore pursued steady state kinetic studies of the cleavage of bovine mIIaΔF1 by bovine prothrombinase to further investigate the mechanisms underlying macromolecular substrate recognition by prothrombinase.DISCUSSIONEvidence for a major role of exosite interactions in the productive pathway for protein substrate recognition by prothrombinase has been previously developed in kinetic studies using prethrombin 2 as a substrate analog for cleavage at the Arg323-Ile324 peptide bond in prothrombin (13Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Data obtained in the present work using mIIaΔF1 suggest that equivalent exosite interactions are relevant for protein substrate recognition and cleavage at the Arg274-Thr275site as well.Evidence to support this conclusion derives from the observation that the product, thrombin (IIai), acts as a competitive inhibitor of the cleavage of either prethrombin 2 (Arg323-Ile324 cleavage) or mIIaΔF1 (Arg274-Thr275 cleavage) by prothrombinase. In contrast, the binding of IIai to prothrombinase has no obvious effect on the access of small ligands and peptidyl substrates to the active site of Xa within prothrombinase (13Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Competitive inhibition of prethrombin 2 activation by IIai occurs with a Ki comparable to the affinity of prothrombinase for the substrate (13Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the case of mIIaΔF1 cleavage, theKi for IIai is exactly equal to the apparent affinity of the enzyme for this substrate. Thrombin and prethrombin 2 share a series of structural features (17Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), while thrombin represents the COOH-terminal domain of mIIaΔF1 (16Martin P.D. Malkowski M.G. Box J. Esmon C.T. Edwards B.F. Structure. 1997; 5: 1681-1693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These points justify the reasonable conclusion that equivalent interactions with an enzymic exosite underlie the recognition and cleavage of both analog substrates for the two half-reactions of prothrombin activation.Alternate substrate studies with mIIaΔF1 have permitted a resolution of the thermodynamic contributions of the presumed exosite (Ks, Scheme FSI) and active site interactions (Ks*, Scheme FSI) to substrate affinity. Although the overall affinity of prothrombinase for mIIaΔF1 is equal to the affinity for IIai (i.e. Km =Kp), this equivalence does not apply to the inferred thermodynamics of the exosite-binding step. The inferred equilibrium dissociation constant for the binding of mIIaΔF1 to the exosite (Ks ≅ 12 μm) is approximately 4-fold greater than the values determined for exosite binding by prethrombin 2 or IIai (13Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, mIIaΔF1 contains the fragment 2 domain that is established to modulate interactions between the protease domain of the substrate and other macromolecular ligands (51Liu L.W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 53Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, the data obtained in studies of mIIaΔF1 cleavage require comparison with the kinetics of activation of prethrombin 2 saturated with fragment 2. The value forKs inferred for mIIaΔF1 in the present work is strikingly similar to the Km previously determined for prethrombin 2 plus fragment 2 (12Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For prethrombin 2 activation, the data are consistent with an unfavorable active site docking step, implying Ks* ≫ 1 (estimated by simulations at Ks* ≥ 8) andKm ≅ Ks in substrate binding steps equivalent to those illustrated in Scheme FSI (13Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).The present results, and the application of Equations 4 and 5 to the steady state kinetic constants for prethrombin 2 plusfragment 2 (12Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), allow for a more appropriate comparison of the stepwise binding interactions that lead to the recognition of the two bonds in the substrate by prothrombinase followed by catalysis (SchemeFSII). Although prethrombin 2plus fragment 2 and mIIaΔF1 are individually cleaved by prothrombinase with different steady state kinetic constants, the dissociation constant for the exosite binding step (Ks) and the inferred rate constant for catalysis (kcat) for these two substrates are equivalent (Scheme FSII). The major difference appears to lie in the equilibrium dissociation constant for the active site docking step (Ks*) that precedes bond cleavage. Active site interactions that precede the cleavage of the Arg274-Thr275 site in mIIaΔF1 appear to be modestly favorable, whereas the comparable binding step that precedes cleavage of the Arg323-Ile324 site in prethrombin 2 plus fragment 2 is an unfavorable step (SchemeFSII).Comparable values for Ks inferred for both protein substrate analogs (Scheme FSII) supports the contention that the initial interaction between both substrates and prothrombinase involves equivalent exosite binding steps. Since prethrombin 2 and thrombin appear to bind this enzymic exosite with greater affinity (Ks ≅ 3 μm) (13Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it follows that the relatively high affinity interaction between fragment 2 and prethrombin 2 (12Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) modestly decreases the affinity of the resultant substrate for the enzymic exosite by a factor of 4. The binding of fragment 2 to prethrombin 2 has also been established to increase theVmax for substrate cleavage by prothrombinase by approximately the same factor (12Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, while the rate-enhancing effects of fragment 2 on the cleavage of prethrombin 2 by prothrombinase are well established in the literature (12Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 54Bajaj S.P. Butkowski R.J. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2150-2156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Esmon C.T. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7791-7797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the data are most consistent with the interpretation that the binding of fragment 2 to prethrombin 2 somehow alters the structure of the substrate, leading to a modest perturbation in the kinetic constants (12Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on previous studies with proteolytic fragments of prethrombin 2 and thrombin (14Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it seems probable that the reduced affinity of the fragment 2-prethrombin 2 complex for exosite binding to prothrombinase arises from linkage between distinct sites in the proteinase domain of the substrate that mediate fragment 2 binding and interactions with the enzymic exosite.The interaction of fragment 2 with thrombin is also likely to reduce the affinity of the product for exosite binding. If the affinity changes observed with prethrombin 2 directly apply to thrombin, it follows that the equilibrium dissociation constant for the interaction between thrombin and the enzymic exosite is approximately 4-fold lower than that of the fragment 2-thrombin complex i.e. Kp ≅ 3 μm, βKp ≅ 12 μm, β ≅ 4 (SchemeFSI). Consequently, the previously measured equilibrium dissociation constant for the binding of fragment 2 to thrombin (Kd = 5 μm) (46Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is also expected to be increased by a factor of 4 in the presence of prothrombinasei.e. KF2,IIa ≅ 5 μm, βKF2,IIa ≅ 20 μm (Scheme FSI). These points provide a reasonable quantitative accounting for the inhibition of mIIaΔF1 cleavage by IIai as well as the modest increase in reaction rate observed in the presence of increasing concentrations of fragment 2 (Fig. 6).Evidence for a high affinity interaction between fragment 2 and thrombin (Kd = 0.8 nm) has previously been obtained at an ionic strength much lower than those used in the present work (56Myrmel K.H. Lundblad R.L. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1767-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A strong ionic strength dependence of this interaction is implied by the substantially larger equilibrium dissociation constant measured by Bock at I = 0.15 m(46Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which seems to represent the most appropriate value for considerations of product inhibition in the present studies. However, a value of KF2,IIa substantially lower than 5 μm would provide more compelling support for the conclusion that fragment 2 binding does not enhance the ability of IIai to bind prothrombinase and would imply a far stronger destabilizing effect of fragment 2 on this interaction.Significant differences in the rate constant for catalysis, inferred by division of Vmax by ET, have been previously noted for the two cleavage reactions in the protein substrate catalyzed by prothrombinase (9Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5386-5391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An obvious explanation for this finding has not been forthcoming since identical P1–P4 residues precede both cleavage sites in prothrombin (36Mann K.G. Elion J. Butkowski R.J. Downing M. Nesheim M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 286-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Assuming that Scheme FSII provides an adequate description of the binding steps in substrate recognition, the present results indicate that the rate constant for catalysis is essentially the same for the two cleavage reactions and is comparable to values observed for the cleavage of peptidyl substrates bearing the same P1–P4 sequence encountered in the protein substrate (57Lottenberg R. Hall J.A. Pautler E. Zupan A. Christensen U. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 874: 326-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Structural models for mIIaΔF1 and prethrombin 2 from x-ray diffraction data indicate that the residues preceding the Arg323-Ile324 bond are either disordered or require significant rearrangement to be successfully docked into the active site of factor Xa (17Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Such features are not observed for the identical residues preceding the Arg274-Thr275bond in mIIaΔF1 (16Martin P.D. Malkowski M.G. Box J. Esmon C.T. Edwards B.F. Structure. 1997; 5: 1681-1693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These observations may provide a structural explanation for the large differences in the equilibrium constant for the active site docking step (Ks*, Scheme FSII) inferred for the two protein substrates. Previous work has established that, although cleavage at Arg323-Ile324 in prethrombin 2 is greatly accelerated by factor Va, the cofactor has a much smaller effect on the cleavage at the Arg274-Thr275 bond in mIIaΔF1 (9Nesheim M.E.

Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If it is indeed true that exosite binding by the protein substrate is only significant following assembly of the prothrombinase complex (13Krishnaswamy S. Betz A.

Studying the redox properties of such systems allows us to gain insight on how anion-induced alterations fine tune the equilibrium between the oxidized and the reduced forms of Hbs. Our results extend earlier studies that have brought to light many possible modes of altering the electronic and ligand binding properties of the active site iron atoms (1–21). Although a large body of literature describes mechanisms involved in controlling the oxygen affinities of Hbs and Mbs, there are still unanswered questions with regard to how globin structure controls the redox potential (E12) of the active site, a parameter that describes the propensity of the site to donate or accept electrons. Evaluating and predicting trends in the redox potentials of Hbs and Mbs, as the composition of both the globin and the medium are changing, is a complex and challenging problem, but one that is fundamental to understanding the way nature is able to accomplish oxygen transport, oxygen storage, and electron transfer reactions in highly polar environments. Oxygenation and oxidation-reduction studies of Fe(II)/Fe(III) centers in diverse Hbs have uncovered parallels between these two processes (22Faulkner K.M. Crumbliss A.L. Bonaventura C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13604-13612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Notably, the shift from the T (deoxy Fe(II)) to the R (oxygenated) or R-like (met Fe(III)) conformation of the Hb tetramer underlies the cooperativity observed in both oxygenation and oxidation processes. Structural changes that stabilize either the T or the R conformation are typically reflected by parallel alterations of both oxidation and reduction processes (1Perutz M. Science Is Not a Quiet Life.

In many Hbs, heterotropic effectors such as protons, anions, and carbon dioxide, although bound at spatially remote sites, influence the oxygenation process and have been shown to affect the oxidation process as well (22Faulkner K.M.

Some anionic effectors, known to bind at the β-β interface in the central cavity of Hb, are capable of influencing the oxygen affinity and the redox potential of the heme groups that are located several Å away. Anion effects on Hb function have traditionally been explained in terms of preferential binding to the low affinity (T state) quaternary conformation (27Benesch R.E. Benesch R. Yu C.I.

Their results indicated the presence of two major classes of binding sites, differing in Cl−affinity. The high affinity sites of deoxyHb showed a 10-fold higher Cl− affinity (about 100 m−1) than in oxyHb (about 10 m−1). These sites are distinctly different from the low affinity sites (about 0.1m−1) that have approximately the same Cl− affinity for both oxy and deoxyHb. Precise pH-stat measurements of Cl− effects on liganded and deoxyHb confirmed the fact that both forms of Hb bind Cl− but with different affinities (31Rollema H.S. de Bruin S.H.

These affinity differences have a direct bearing on the magnitude and often disputed origin of the Bohr effect (31Rollema H.S. de Bruin S.H. Janssen L.H.M. van Os G.A.J. J. Biol.

The N-terminal valine residues and positively charged residues of the β chain 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding site have been implicated in preferential anion binding by deoxyHb, although recent x-ray and chemical studies of Perutz et al. (36Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Poyard C. Pagnier J. Kister J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) found no clear indications of specific Cl− binding sites in either bovine or human hemoglobin. We recently showed that Cl− effects on oxygen binding derive in part from steric hindrance effects that are not present in oxidation processes (22Faulkner K.M. Crumbliss A.L. Bonaventura C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13604-13612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The situation with regard to Cl− effects on Hb function is thus more complex than can be explained by anion binding at a few specific sites. Lack of awareness of the rather dramatic changes in ease of anaerobic oxidation of the heme that occur as anion levels are altered between 0 and 0.4 m, as documented in this report, may have led to apparently conflicting results in laboratories examining Hb function under what appeared to be similar experimental conditions. We have previously shown that comparison of oxidation and oxygenation curves can help discriminate between the electronic and steric consequences that result from changes in globin structure (22Faulkner K.M. Crumbliss A.L. Bonaventura C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13604-13612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this paper we present the results of systematic studies of the anaerobic oxidation of a selected set of structurally distinct Hbs and Mbs as a function of anion type and concentration. Our aim is to further clarify the impact these anions have on the electronic properties of the active site of these proteins. Anaerobic oxidation curves were obtained to document the influence of a broad concentration range of anionic effectors (organic polyphosphates, chloride, nitrate, and perchlorate) on the oxidation of various Hbs (dolphin Hb, horse Hb, spot fish Hb, Hb Presbyterian, and Hb A0) and Mbs (sperm whale Mb and its carbamylated variant, horse Mb and its carbamylated variant, and Aplysia Mb). The oxidation curves reveal intriguing aspects of the concentration dependence of anion effects on the electron affinity of the heme groups of these representative Hbs and Mbs and highlight the importance of a careful choice of background electrolyte and buffer system when studying these heme proteins. Our earlier comparisons of oxygenation and oxidation processes led us to suggest a new paradigm of Hb function, in which anion-induced restrictions of the conformational fluctuations of the Hb molecule play a large and previously unrecognized role in control of oxygen affinity (26Bonaventura C. Tesh S. Faulkner K.M. Kraiter D. Crumbliss A.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The concentration-dependent anion effects presented in this report further support this paradigm and show that anion-induced changes in the hydrophilicity of the heme pocket could account for the dramatic contrast between anion effects on oxidation and oxygenation processes. Ru(NH3)6Cl3 (Strem Chemical Co.; >99%), NaNO3 (Mallinckrodt; >99%), KNO3 (Sigma; >99%), MOPS (Sigma; >99%), HEPES (Sigma; >99%), KCl (Fisher; >99%), IHP (Sigma; 98%), and platinum (52 mesh gauze; Fisher; 99.95%) were used as received. Horse Mb, carbamylated horse Mb, sperm whale Mb, carbamylated sperm whale Mb,Aplysia Mb, Hb A0, bottlenose dolphin Hb, and horse Hb were prepared by the ammonium sulfate method (37Bonaventura C. Arumugam M. Cashon R. Bonaventura J. Moo-Penn W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Samples were stripped of organic phosphates by a two-step passage through mixed bed resin, using a high salt elution to displace tightly bound phosphates followed by a low salt elution to remove excess salt. All samples except horse Hb (two major Hbs) and dolphin Hb (showing single electrophoretic bands) were subjected to chromatographic purification with a fast performance liquid chromatography system and stored in liquid nitrogen at 1–3 mm (in heme). Sample concentrations and oxidation states were determined spectrophotometrically using published extinction coefficients (38Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Caughey W.S. Biochemical and Clinical Aspects of Hemoglobin Abnormalities. Academic Press, New York1978: 647-663Crossref Google Scholar). Samples containing spectrally detectable levels of hemichrome were discarded. The relative levels of oxidized Mb or Hb (metMb or metHb) and oxygenated Mb or Hb (oxyMb or oxyHb) were determined by spectral analysis using a Cary model 2300 UV-visible spectrophotometer. For spectroelectrochemistry, the electrochemical mediator Ru(NH3)6Cl3 was dissolved in a 0.05m MOPS buffer or 0.05 m HEPES buffer solution adjusted to pH 7.1 or 7.5, respectively, to give a concentration of 4.5–5.5 mm. Ru(NH3)63+/2+ has aE12 of 0.214 V relative to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE; all potentials reported in this manuscript are standardized relative to the NHE scale), which makes it suitable as a mediator for Mb and Hb electrochemistry. It creates no spectral or allosteric interferences as shown previously (25Faulkner K.M. Crumbliss A.L. Bonaventura C. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1994; 226: 187-194Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MOPS and HEPES were selected as the buffers for their noncomplexing nature and stability, as well as the absence of spectral and electrochemical interferences. Stock solutions of 2.0 m KNO3 in 0.05m MOPS, pH 7.1, 20 mm IHP in 0.05 mHEPES, pH 7.5; and 2.0 m KCl in 0.05 m MOPS at pH 7.1 and 0.05 m HEPES at pH 7.5 were used to prepare the working solutions for spectroelectrochemistry. Nanopure water was used at all times, and all solutions were stored under a N2atmosphere at 4 °C after removal from liquid nitrogen. For each experiment, a solution containing 1 mmRu(NH3)6Cl3 and 0.05 mMOPS or HEPES at pH 7.1 or 7.5 with specific concentrations of anions in a 5-ml pear-shaped flask was connected to a vacuum line for repeated pump purging with N2, followed by addition of Mb or Hb and additional pump purging with gentle swirling to minimize bubbling. Final concentrations were typically 0.06–0.08 mm in heme. Spectroelectrochemical experiments were carried out in an anaerobic optically transparent thin layer electrode cell made in-house of a 1 × 2-cm piece of 52-mesh platinum gauze placed between the inside wall of a 1-cm-path length cuvette and a piece of silica glass held in place by a small Tygon spacer positioned so as not to interfere with the spectral measurement (25Faulkner K.M. Crumbliss A.L. Bonaventura C. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1994; 226: 187-194Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This assembly results in an optical path length of 0.03 cm, as calculated from the absorbance of the fully oxidized spectrum of Mb/Hb at ca. 554 nm (3Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). The cell was kept anaerobic by capping the cuvette with a septum that allowed no air to enter but permitted a continuous flow of N2. A platinum wire connected to the platinum gauze working electrode was inserted through the septum. A Pasteur pipette salt bridge plugged at the bottom with an agar gel was prepared so as to connect the Ag/AgCl reference (Bioanalytical Systems Inc.) electrode to the working electrode. The salt bridge solution was composed of 0.2 mKCl in 0.05 m MOPS at pH 7.1 or 0.2 m KCl in 0.05 m HEPES at pH 7.5 and was degassed and then flushed with N2 for 1 h. The optically transparent thin layer electrode cell was purged with N2 for 15 min prior to injecting the protein solution. In a typical experiment, about 0.5 ml of the working solution was injected at the bottom of the optically transparent thin layer electrode cell via a gas tight syringe. The cell was then placed in the temperature-controlled cell holder of a CARY 2300 UV-visible spectrophotometer held at 20 °C and linked to a PAR model 75 potentiostat. Spectroelectrochemistry was carried out from 340 to 700 nm, with specific emphasis on the Soret region. Absorbance changes were monitored at 410 nm (metMb) or 406 nm (metHb) and 435 nm (deoxyMb) or 430 nm (deoxyHb). The absorbances of the fully oxidized (Ao) and fully reduced (Ar) Mb and Hb were obtained by applying a potential of +400 mV and −250 mV (versus NHE), respectively, and the absorbance was recorded when the system reached equilibrium (no more change in absorbance at the fixed potential and wavelength). For each experiment, the path length was determined using the Soret band absorbance. The concentration was determined independently by spectral analysis after addition of the oxygen scavenger sodium dithionite (2 mg/ml) to the unused sample solution. A typical increment of 20 mV was applied to the system starting at approximately +300 mV down to −120 mV (versus NHE). At each applied potential, the absorbance was monitored until no change was detected. Although most experiments were performed going from fully oxidized to fully reduced Mb, the system was shown to be reversible under our experimental conditions (i.e. the Nernst plot can be generated in either the oxidation or reduction direction and equilibrium is achieved within 30–40 min at each applied potential). Nernst plots were then derived from the observed changes in absorbance as was described previously (25Faulkner K.M. Crumbliss A.L. Bonaventura C. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1994; 226: 187-194Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 a sets the stage for comparative studies by illustrating a set of oxidation curves, presented as Nernst plots, for three distinct Mb systems. These plots illustrate redox differences associated with a first coordination shell effect. Monomeric Aplysia Mb exhibits anE12 value 75 mV more positive than that of sperm whale Mb and horse Mb. The Nernst plots have slopes of unity, as we previously reported for similar noncooperative one-electron transfer systems (3Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 39Taboy C.H. Bonaventura C. Crumbliss A.L. Bioelectrochem.

A valine residue at position E7 in AplysiaMb replaces the more common distal histidine present in both sperm whale and horse Mbs (40Bolognesi M. Onesti S. Gatti G. Coda A. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The crystal structures show the presence of a water molecule in the distal heme pocket of both horse and sperm whale Mbs, stabilized by the distal histidine residue (3Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 40Bolognesi M. Onesti S. Gatti G. Coda A. Ascenzi P. Brunori M. J. Mol.

The presence of this water molecule as a sixth ligand in the oxidized form of the protein is consistent with the negative shift inE12 observed for these two Mbs relative toAplysia Mb, which does not possess this water ligand. Fig. 1 b and results shown in TableI illustrate how globin differences in Hb can alter the shape and position of the Nernst plots. Nernst plots for horse Hb, bottlenose dolphin Hb, and human Hb (Hb A0) have mid-point (n12) slopes greater than 1, consistent with a cooperative redox process. The redox curves of dolphin Hb and horse Hb are equivalent and shifted to lower potentials relative to Hb A0, indicating their increased ease of oxidation. The crystal structures and primary sequences of these three Hbs show that they have few differences in the active site region (3Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 44Perutz M.F. Nature. 1960; 185: 491-496Crossref Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 45Kleinschimdt T. Braunitzer G. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1983; 42: 685-695PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the presence of a serine at the position Ε14β in dolphin and horse Hbs has been identified (3Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 46Kristensen E.W. Igo D.H. Elder R.C. Heineman W.R. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1991; 309: 61-72Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This residue, outside the first coordination sphere of the iron, replaces an alanine found in Hb A0. The presence of this serine appears to create a more hydrophilic distal heme pocket and thereby increases the ease of active site Hb oxidation. These intrinsic differences in redox potential may be distinguished from those brought about by allosteric effectors, as documented in the figures that follow.

Fig. 2 illustrates the effects of relatively low levels of anions (0.2 m Cl− or Pi, and 1:10 heme:IHP) on the oxidation of (a) Hb A0, (b) bottlenose dolphin Hb, and (c) spot fish Hb. The shifts in redox potential (E12) illustrated indicate that low levels of anions stabilize the reduced state (resulting in decreased ease of oxidation). These Nernst plots also illustrate the strong allosteric effect of IHP on the redox behavior of Hb. This highly charged anion brings about a strong positive shift of theE12, with a negligible shift of the initial stages of oxidation and large shifts of the final stages of oxidation. This result is consistent with T state stabilization, where the more highly charged phosphates are typically stronger effectors than the monovalent Cl− anion. The decreased n12 is consistent with an incomplete transition of metHb to the R state. The results of Fig. 2 are paralleled by anion-induced decreases in the O2 affinities of these Hbs (data not shown) and demonstrate that the effects of low levels of anionic effectors on the redox and oxygenation process are not species-specific. Fig. 3 takes the general observations in Fig. 2 one step further by documenting the alterations of the Nernst plots for Hb A0 in the presence of varied levels of Cl−. Three types of behavior can be observed in Fig. 3 and will be discussed further. First, as shown in Fig. 3 a, Hb A0 becomes less easily oxidized as Cl− levels increase from 0 to 0.2 m. Over this range of anion levels there is a progressive shift of the mid-point of the curves that defines the redox potential of the protein (E12). There is also a shift to a more positive potential in the final stages of oxidation (where log[ox]/[red] ≥ 1), showing that the R-like state of metHb has been destabilized. There is no change in the initial stages of oxidation (where log[ox]/[red] < −1), showing that the electronic properties of the T state of deoxyHb are unaltered by low levels of Cl−. These alterations are consistent with a simple two state MWC model, where Cl− acts as a simple allosteric effector and causes redox shifts as it binds preferentially to the central cavity of Hb in its T state. As a consequence of anion-induced shape changes, the sigmoidal curves flatten, with somewhat lower n12 values, as the concentration of Cl− increases. An unexpected result of this intensive study of anion effects on Hb is shown in Fig. 3 b. There is, rather remarkably, a reversal of the trend in E12 as Cl− levels are increased from 0.2 to 0.4 m. The entire Nernst plot shifts toward a more easily oxidized species. Both top (R state) and bottom (T state) parts of the curve shift toward more negative potentials. It is significant that similar shifts are associated with an increased hydrophilicity of the heme environment (Fig. 1 b). Finally, as shown in Fig. 3 c, between 0.4 and 1.0m [ Cl−] a shift in the final stage of oxidation is observed but in the opposite direction as compared with Fig. 3 a. That is, the top of the curves (where log [ox]/[red] ≥ 1) shift to a more negative potential, suggesting a shift in the relative stability of the R-like state. It is noteworthy that over this concentration range the slopes of the curves (n12 values) increase as the concentration of Cl− increases. Fig. 4 a plots the redox potential (E12) of Hb A0 and representative Mbs as a function of varied levels of three anionic effectors (Cl−, NO3−, and ClO4−). We show that the concentration-dependent reversal of E12observed for Cl− interactions with Hb also occurs for other small anionic effectors. The same trends are evident for all three effectors, with sensitivity to anion concentration decreasing in the order NO3− > Cl−≫ ClO4−. This ease of anaerobic oxidation reversal is clearly associated with the cooperative Hb system, since, as also shown in Fig. 4 a, this trend is not observed in the case of various monomeric Mbs. The relatively small and progressive decrease in E12 for these Mbs is like that shown in Fig. 3 c for Hb exposed to Cl−concentrations of 0.4 to 2.0 m, indicating that the larger anion-induced shifts observed in tetrameric Hbs are superimposed on the background effects seen with the noncooperative Mb systems. The inset of Fig. 4 a shows that there is a competition between IHP and Cl− for sites on Hb A0 as Cl− levels are raised above 0.2m. This is a significant result with respect to the globin binding site responsible for the reversal of redox potential at the active site, because the dominant IHP binding site is known to be in the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding region, in the central cavity between the two β chains (47Arnone A.

The cDNA encodes 544 amino acids having 83% amino acid homology to the chitinase of the tobacoo hornworm,Manduca sexta. The total length of the gene is larger than 25 kilobase pairs, and it is separated into 11 exons. The intron-exon boundaries are all in accordance with the GT-AG rule. Also, the TATA box sequence was found in the 5′ upstream region of the gene, and the gene is mapped on the seventh chromosome. A novel DNA type transposon that shows similarity to the Tc-like element was found in the third intron in some strains of B. mori; other strains, however, lack this element in the same intron. This element has long terminal inverted repeats, presumably encodes a transposase of about 340 amino acids with a DDE motif, and has an amino-terminal domain with a strong nuclear localization function. Seven other transposable elements with homologous but distinct sequences were isolated from the B. mori genome. Together with plaque hybridization results, our findings suggest that these novel elements exist in multiple copies constituting a newTc-like transposable element family in the silkworm genome.

Insects utilize it as the major component of their exoskelton. When bound to proteins, chitin is strong enough both mechanically and biochemically to protect and light enough to allow smooth locomotion. However, once made as a component of the integument, chitin, unlike bone in vertebrates, has no growth capability, and the insects have to molt or undergo metamorphosis to reconstruct their integuments. Insect chitinase (family number 18 of glycosyl hydrolases, endochitinase) is induced by ecdysteroids at the time of molting and metamorphosis of the larvae to degrade most of the older chitin (1Kimura S. J. Insect Physiol. 1973; 19: 115-123Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 2Koga D. Fujimoto H. Funakoshi T. Utsumi T. Ide A. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 123-128Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Further hydrolysis of the partially digested chitin is done by β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (exochitinase) that is also inducible by ecdysteroid (3Koga D. Funakoshi T. Mizuki K. Ide A. Kramer K.J. Zen K.-C. Choi H. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 22: 305-311Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The recycling of β1,4-N-acetylglucosamine from the older integument to the new integument was shown in larval-adult molting of Locusta migratoria (4Surholt B. J. Comp.

Insect Physiol. 1986; 32: 133-142Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). From insects, the chitinase cDNA of the tobacco hormworm Manduca sexta, has been isolated (6Kramer K.J. Corpuz L. Choi H.K. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). With more than 4000 years of domestication history (7Yoshitake N. Jpn. J. Genet. 1966; 4: 259-267Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), Bombyx mori is one of the genetically most well studied organisms and is also a suitable model for hormone research. The existence of the molting hormone secreted from the prothoracic gland was experimentally shown using B. mori pupae (8Fukuda S. Proc. Imp. Acad. (Tokyo). 1940; 16: 417-420Crossref Google Scholar, 9Fukuda S. J. Fac. Sci. Tokyo Imp. Univ. Sec. IV. 1944; 6: 477-532Google Scholar). The molting hormone, ecdysone, was isolated from the pupae of B. mori and crystallized, and its chemical structure was determined (10Butenandt A. Karlson P. Z. Naturforsch. 1954; 9b: 389-391Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The existence of the neuropeptide called prothoracicotropic hormone that stimulates the release of ecdysone was predicted (11Kobayashi M. Kimura J. Nature. 1958; 181: 1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the hormone was finally isolated and characterized (12Kataoka H. Nagasawa H. Isogai A. Tamura S. Mizoguchi A. Fujiwara Y. Suzuki C. Ishizaki H. Suzuki A. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 1067-1076Google Scholar). Here we describe the cDNA cloning, characterization of the genomic organization, and chromosomal localization of the B. morichitinase gene. Moreover, we have shown the presence of the novelTc-like transposable element in the intron of this gene in a strain-dependent manner. The distribution and function of this Tc element family are discussed. The larvae of B. mori strain Shunrei X Showgetsu were purchased from Kanebo Silk Elegance Co. (Kasugai, Japan). High molecular weight genome DNA of other B. mori strains and insects was prepared as described previously (13Promboon A. Shimada T. Fujiwara H. Kobayashi M. Genet. Res. 1995; 66: 1-7Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Total RNA of B. moriShunrei X Showgetsu strain was isolated from the integument of a prepupa (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar), and the first-strand cDNA was synthesized. Degenerative forward primers F1 (5′-GCNA/CGNATA/T/CGTNTGNTAT/CTT-3′), F2 (5′-GAT/CATA/T/CCCNGTNGAA/GAAA/GTG-3′), and F3 (5′-GAA/GT/CTNGAT/CGTNGAT/CAAA/GAA-3′) and reverse primers R1 (5′-GGA/GCANCCT/CTTT/CTCT/CTCCCA-3′), R2 (5′-CAA/T/GATT/CTCA/GTAA/GTANGCCCA-3′), R3 (5′-TCA/GTCCCAT/CTTT/CTTNGTCCA-3′), and R4 (5′-TTT/CTGT/CTTA/T/GATCCAA/GTTCAT-3′) (N for A, T, G, and C) were designed from the amino acid sequence of the chitinase of M. sexta (Ref. 6Kramer K.J. Corpuz L. Choi H.K. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession numberU02270). The amino acid positions were chosen to minimize the degeneracy. Amplification reactions (100 μl) contained 2 μl of first-strand cDNA, 0.2 mm deoxyribonucleotides, 10 μm degenerative forward primer, 10 μmdegenerative reverse primer, and 5 units of ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara). Temperature cycling was carried out at 94 °C for 3.5 min, followed by 32 cycles of 1.5 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 45 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C, and an additional 12 min at 72 °C. A combination of nested primers (5′-GCGACCATGAACTTGACATC-3′ and 5′-CCACTCTTATCTACGTCCAA-3′ or 5′-TACGCATACAAGGGAACTCA-3′ and 5′-CCTCGTAGTGTGGAGATCAA-3′) was used for 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE, respectively. The full-length B. mori chitinase cDNA amplification reaction (50 μl) contained 1 μl of B. mori first-strand cDNA, 0.3 μm primer B1 (5′-CGGAGCTGCACGGACGAACC-3′) and primer B2 (5′-GACCAGTCTGAGTTCCGCTT-3′), and 2.6 units of Expand High Fidelity System Enzyme (Boehringer). Temperature cycling was carried out at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C and an additional 9 min at 72 °C. PCR products were cloned into pCRII vector (Invitrogen) or pGEMTEasy vector (Promega) and sequenced by using the dye terminator method. Gel analysis was done at Cybergene (Novum, Huddinge, Sweden). From the EMBL3 B. mori genomic DNA library (15Okazaki S. Tsuchida K. Maekawa H. Ishikawa H. Fujiwara H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1424-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), clones containing the chitinase gene were isolated with the 32P-labeled 0.64-kb PCR fragment (probe 1) generated from B. morichitinase cDNA with primers 5′-GGCGTCGGACGTTATGGCAT-3′ and 5′-AGACCATCATTCACGTTAAG-3′. The 32P-labeled 0.22-kb probe 2, generated by PCR with primers 5′-GATTGGACCATCATCTATATGCCAC-3′ and 5′-CGCGTAGTCCTTTCGCTATAGGGT-3′ from B. mori chitinase gene intron 1, was used to isolate the promoter region-containing clones. Hybridizations of the plaque-blotted Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed in 5× SSC (750 mm NaCl, 75 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.5% SDS at 65 °C overnight with probe 1 or probe 2. The membranes hybridized with probe 1 were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS for 5 min at room temperature, washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C, and washed more than twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C until the background signals were reduced. The membranes hybridized with probe 2 were washed under less stringent conditions. The finished DNA sequence was analyzed with DNA STAR and DNA Strider programs. BLASTN and BLASTP programs were used to find similarities to sequences in public databases. The promoter sequence was analyzed with the TESS program. Alignment of Tc/mariner transposases was done by using the GCG program. All the intron/exon junctions of the B. mori chitinase gene were determined by sequencing the genomic clones. The sizes of introns were determined by PCR or sequencing. The existence of the B. mori Tc-like element 1 (BmTc1) within intron 3 was checked by PCR with primers B3 (5′-CAGTAATTGGGCGGTGTACCGACC-3′) and B4 (5′-GGGTGTTTGGAGCGGAGGGATGTG-3′). BmTc family elements were isolated from the genome of B. mori by PCR with the primers T1 (5′-TACACTCGCGAGCAAAAGT/CTTGG-3′) or T2 (5′-CACTTACTTGAAATTA/GGTTCCGCG-3′). Amplification conditions were essentially the same as those for full-length chitinase cDNA, using 0.2 μg of B. mori genome DNA as a template.32P-labeled BmTc1 probes generated by PCR with primers 5′-GACTCAAGCTAGCGAATCTGACTCC-3′ and 5′-ATAGCTCAGAGGTATATGTGCTGA-3′ were used for the genomic Southern and plaque hybridization in essentially the same way described for the chitinase gene screening. Linkage mapping was done by analyzing the genetic segregation of 95 individuals of F2 generated from a crossover between the p50 and C108 strains. B3 and B4 primers were used for amplification of the fragments. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers were used to compare the segregation pattern with these chitinase marker fragments (13Promboon A. Shimada T. Fujiwara H. Kobayashi M. Genet. Res. 1995; 66: 1-7Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The BmTc1 DNA region encoding the amino-terminal 68 amino acids was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-AGAATTCACCACCATGGAGACAACACCTACA-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCCCCCGAATATCTCGGAGCTG-3′ and ligated into theEcoRI site of pEGFP-C2 vector to construct pEGFP-C2-BmTc1N1. COS-7 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 25 μg/ml kanamycin were plated onto 6-well plates (Costar) 48 h before transfection and transfected with 0.5 μg of pEGFP-C2-BmTc1N1 or pEGFP-C2 in each well using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 30 h after transfection, cells were observed through fluorescent confocal microscopy (Leica). A set of nested degenerative primers (Fig. 1 A) was used to PCR-amplify B. mori chitinase cDNA (Fig. 1 B). The longest PCR fragment (Fig. 1 B, lane 4) was sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence shows homology to the corresponding sequence of M. sexta chitinase. 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE were done with primers designed from the DNA sequences of this RT-PCR product (Fig. 1, C and D). The deduced amino acid sequences of the 0.5-kb fragment of 5′-RACE and the 1.8-kb fragment of 3′-RACE show homology to M. sexta chitinase, and the latter contains poly(A) signal before the poly(A) sequence. B1 and B2 primers were designed, and the 1.7-kb cDNA encoding full-length B. mori chitinase was amplified. The open reading frame contains the ADSRARIVCYFSNWAVYRPG motif after the putative signal peptide sequence (Fig. 2). This motif matches the reported amino-terminal sequence of the chitinase purified from B. mori larvae (16Koga D. Sasaki Y. Uchiumi Y. Hirai N. Arakane Y. Nagamatsu Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As deduced from the cDNA sequence, the total length of B. mori chitinase was 544 amino acids and showed 83% homology to M. sexta chitinase. The hydrophilicity plots were quite similar between these two variants of chitinase. The putative active site region FDGLDLDWEYP, conserved in chitinases of M. sexta (6Kramer K.J. Corpuz L. Choi H.K. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and Homo sapiens (17Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J.

At the nucleotide level, the coding region of the two insect chitinases showed 72% homology.Figure 1PCR amplification of chitinase cDNA fromB. mori prepupal RNA. A, a set of nested degenerative primers was designed based on the M. sexta chitinase cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number U02270). B, RT-PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel. Primer sets F1/R1, F1/R2, F1/R3, F1/R4, F2/R1, F2/R2, F2/R3, F2/R4, F3/R3, and F3/R4 were used for lanes 1–10, respectively. C, 5′-RACE products were separated on a 1% agarose gel. D, 3′-RACE products were separated on a 1% agarose gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We screened the B. mori genomic phage library with cDNA probe 1, and two clones covering the whole chitinase gene except for exon 1 and intron 1 were isolated. This missing region was PCR-amplified from B. mori genomic DNA. All the chitinase-encoding and intron/exon boundary sequences were determined. The encoding sequences were identical between the RT-PCR clone and the genomic clone except for a single nucleotide giving no amino acid change, a discrepancy that is possibly due to strain or individual differences. The chitinase gene of B. mori was separated into 11 exons (Fig. 3). All the intron/exon boundary sequences (Table I) follow the GT-AG rule, and the 5′ ends of the introns give consensus GTGAGT intron entry site (18Garel A. Deleage G. Prudhomme J.-C. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The intron positions were mostly similar to that of the M. sexta homolog. However, the sizes of the corresponding introns between these homologous genes were different. The total length of intron 2 to intron 10 was 17.36 kb in B. mori, and the total length of the corresponding introns of theM. sexta gene was 8.13 kb. We found one intron insertion position not conserved between B. mori and M. sexta but conserved between B. mori and the human homolog gene (19Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Verhoek M. Strijland A. Bliek J.

A putative TATA box sequence, putative Sp1 binding sites, a motif (TCTGT) similar to the arthropod capsite consensus sequences (TCAGT) (20Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and a half site element (AGAACA) that may work as ecdysteroid-responsive element (data not shown) were also found. Within intron 3, we found a novel class II DNA-type transposable element (Fig. 3). A short stretch of nucleotides encoding the PDLNPIEHLW motif highly conserved in the Tc-like transposon family (21Capy P. Vitalis R. Langin T. Higuet D. Bazin C. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) showed 83% homology to the Tc1 element of Caenorhabditis elegans. We named this novel 1656-base pair transposable elementBmTc1. Long terminal imperfect inverted repeats and putative transposase-encoding open reading frames were identified (Fig.5). Optimizing the reading frame, this element encodes a putative protein of 343 amino acids, and, using a BLASTP search, a 32% identity was marked by the transposase homolog of parasite nematode Haemonchus contortus (22Hoekstra R. Osten M. Lenstra J.A. Roos M.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The deduced amino-terminal amino acid sequences of this element show significant homology to the DNA binding region of the D. melanogastertranscription factor paired protein (Fig.6 A), as suggested in otherTc family members (23Franz G. Loukeris T.G. Dialektaki G. Thompson C.R.L. Charalambos S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4746-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Tc- and mariner-like transposases possess DDE and DDD motifs in their putative active site of recombination, respectively (21Capy P. Vitalis R. Langin T. Higuet D. Bazin C. J. Mol.

Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 337-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The BmTc1 putative transposase contains the DDE motif, and the amino acid sequence surrounding these residues is conserved (Fig.6 B).Figure 6Amino acid sequence alignment of BmTc1 putative transposase with paired (A) and other transposases (B). A, putative DNA binding domains of BmTc1 and D. melanogaster paired DNA binding domain are aligned using the GCG program. B,putative transposase active site block A, block B1, and block B2 of BmTc1 were aligned with the corresponding domains of Tc/mariner transposase family members using the GCG program.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) By PCR with B3 and B4 primers designed to amplify intron 3 of the chitinase gene, homozygotic and heterozygotic existence of the element within this intron was suggested in the C108 and Kokin strain ofB. mori, respectively. For five other strains (p50, J137, Oha, Sekko, and Kansen), no insertion of the BmTc1 element was suggested. An additional TATA sequence in the putative insertional position of the element was observed in the genes of four strains lacking BmTc1. Using primer T1 or T2 designed from the terminal sequences of theBmTc1 element, we have PCR-amplified fragments ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 kb from the template DNA of both the C108 and p50 strains. The 1.6-kb fragments amplified from C108 strain DNA with primer T1 were subcloned. The HaeIII digestion pattern of the insert DNA of each clone suggested the existence of the BmTc family (data not shown). DNA sequences of seven clones were determined and found to be homologous, constituting a new Tc-like element family inB. mori (Fig. 7). Using T1 primers, 1.5-kb PCR amplification fragment was obtained from the DNA of B. mandarina. However, DNA of other silk moths (Samia cynthia ricini, Antheraea yamamai, andDictyoploca japonica), D. melanogaster, H. sapiens, and Rattus norvegicus gave no amplification products. The copy number of the BmTc family is estimated as 43 per haploid B. mori genome because the genome size is 530 Mb (26Gage L.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Rasch E.M. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1974; 45: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and 40.5 positive plaques were identified on a membrane containing a total of a 500-Mb insert of B. mori DNA by hybridizing with BmTc1 probe. The strain-specific genomic Southern hybridization patterns were observed with BmTc1probe, suggesting that BmTc family elements are mostly integrated into different part of the genome of the two B. mori strains (Fig. 8). We also tested the nuclear localization activity of the amino-terminal 68 amino acids of BmTc1 putative transposase (BmTc1N1) by fusion to GFP. COS-7 cells were transfected with pEGFP-C2-BmTc1N1 that could express the GFP-BmTc1N1 protein. In these cells, apparent nuclear localization of GFP-BmTc1N1 was observed in more than 90% of the transfected cells (Fig. 9, Aand B). In contrast, cells expressing GFP alone displayed a diffuse and uniform cellular fluorescence (Fig. 9, C andD). Chromosomal localization of the chitinase gene was determined by linkage analysis with RAPD markers mapped on each chromosome using polymorphism between the C108 and p50 strains (13Promboon A. Shimada T. Fujiwara H. Kobayashi M. Genet. Res. 1995; 66: 1-7Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Primers B3 and B4 were used to detect segregation of F2 progenies resulting from a cross between p50 and C108. RAPD marker R1.41 showed cosegregation with the chitinase gene (Table II). The recombination value was calculated as follows: ((2 + 2 + 2 + 4)/95) × 2 = 21.05% (multiplied by 2 due to lack of crossover in female B. mori).Table IILinkage mapping of the chitinase gene of Bombyx moriChitinaseR1.41No. of individualsHH42PP27CC16CH 2HC 2HP 2PH 4PC 0Linkage analysis was done by using RAPD markers mapped on each chromosome of B. mori.

The recombinants between the chitinase locus and R1.41 are shown below the dashed line. The R1.41 marker was previously mapped on chromosome 7 of the B. mori genome, and we conclude that the chitinase gene is also mapped on this chromosome. Chitinase cDNA has been cloned from various organisms including microorganisms, plants, and higher animals. Chitinase has three major functional roles, controlling growth via degradation of chitin in the organism. In insects (28Kramer K.J. Koga D. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 851-877Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and yeasts (29Kuranda M.J. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19758-19767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enzymes play essential roles in the regulation of growth. In plants, chitinases are induced by wounding and thought to be involved in protection from fungal infection. On the other hand, insect pathogens such as baculovirus have the chitinase gene within their genome and use this enzyme for the invasion of insect bodies (30Hawtin R.E. Zarkowska T. Arnold K. Thomas C.J. Gooday G.W. King L.A. Kuzio J.A. Possee R.D. Virology. 1997; 238: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We have mapped the chitinase gene of B. mori to chromosome 7; interestingly, the fungal resistance gene called cal has been mapped on the same chromosome (31Aratake Y. Bull. Seric. Exp. Stn. ( Tokyo ). 1961; 17: 155-171Google Scholar). The cDNA (17Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Strijland A. van Zonneveld A.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26252-26256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and the genomic gene (19Boot R.G. Renkema G.H. Verhoek M. Strijland A. Bliek J. Meulemeester T.M.A.M.O. Mannens M.M.A.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25680-25685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) of human chitinase have been cloned recently. The expression of human chitinase is induced in activated macrophages, and this enzyme might be related to the defense mechanism against fungal infections. An increase in chitinase activity was also observed in the spleen of guinea pig after intravenous infection with the pathogenic fungusAspergillus fumigatus (32Overdijk B. Van Steijn G.J. Odds F.C. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We found a published cDNA encoding a putative chitinase of B. mori similar to our sequence (Ref. 33Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.-S. Kim S.C. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar; GenBankTMaccession number U86876). The amino-terminal regions of the two cDNA sequences were almost identical; however, they differ in the carboxyl-terminal coding region. We have found direct repeats of 112 base pairs in the cDNA sequence published previously (33Kim M.G. Shin S.W. Bae K.-S. Kim S.C. Park H.-Y. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This second repeat is inserted 5 base pairs before the stop codon of our sequence and encodes 22 additional amino acids. We could not find this second repeat sequence in the B. mori chitinase gene. Also, there was no full-length cDNA clone identical to the sequence ofU86876 in the clones obtained by RT-PCR, although the primers used in the experiment should also amplify the cDNA. The chitinase amino acid sequence reported here contains the amino-terminal 20-amino acid sequence ADSRARIVCYFSNWAVYRPG, matching the sequence determined as the amino-terminal sequence of the purified chitinase of B. mori. However, the deduced amino acid sequence of U86876 contains S instead of A at the first position of this motif. We need to further investigate the reason for the difference between the two chitinase cDNA sequences. One possibility is that the discrepancies between the cDNAs are related to strain differences, and another possibility is that the direct repeat sequence in the cDNA might be regulated at the splicing level. The copy number of the chitinase gene of B. mori is probably 1 per haploid genome. However, inD. melanogaster and Aedes aegypti, at least 4 chitinase genes are found (34de le Vega H. Specht C.A. Liu Y. Robbins P.W. Insect Mol. Biol. 1998; 7: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is likely that the original copy number of the chitinase gene of Arthropods was 1, and in Diptera, the gene was amplified, whereas in Lepidoptera, the gene was not amplified. However, we may need more detailed analysis, e.g., the gene targeting method recently developed in B. mori (35Yamao M. Katayama N. Nakazawa H. Yamakawa M. Hayashi Y. Hara S. Kamei K. Mori H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to knock out the gene, to draw a conclusion on the copy number of the chitinase gene and the functional role of its products in the insect. Interestingly, expression of M. sexta chitinase gene was strongly induced in a few tissues of insect larvae including the epidermis, foregut, and hindgut (6Kramer K.J. Corpuz L. Choi H.K. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of this tissue-specific hormone-responsive induction of insect chitinase has not been studied because the cloning of the 5′ promoter region of the gene was unsuccessful (36Choi H.K. Choi K.H. Kramer K.J. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we have cloned a 5-kb promoter region of the B. mori chitinase gene, and it would facilitate further study of the tissue-specific hormone-dependent expression of this gene. The existence of the BmTc1 element in intron 3 might affect the splicing efficiencies of chitinase mRNA because it may form a stem loop structure by hybridizing at the long terminal inverted repeats. However, the molting process does not differ obviously betweenB. mori strains, 2T. Shimada, unpublished observations. and the physiological effects of BmTc1 insertion might be minimal. Heterogenic existence of BmTc1 in B. mori strains could support this conclusion. Transposable elements are found in the genome of various organisms and believed to contribute to the reorganization of the genome through their vertical and horizontal transmission. An additional TATA sequence found in the third intron of the chitinase gene of some B. mori strains clearly suggests this model in higher organisms. Transposable elements are classified into two groups: (a) class I is retrotransposon-type elements that transpose via RNA intermediates, and (b) class II is DNA-type elements that transpose via DNA intermediates (21Capy P. Vitalis R. Langin T. Higuet D. Bazin C. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Tc/mariner-like transposable elements represent one of the major superfamilies of the class II transposons. The transposable element we found should belong to the Tc family, having a DDE motif in its putative transposase-encoding region. Another type of class II transposable element, Bmmar1, is also found in the genome of B. mori (37Robertson H.M. Asplund M.L. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Bmmar1 elements have a DDD motif and are classified as members of the mariner family. The estimated copy number of Bmmar1 is more than 1000 per haploid genome. On the other hand, we estimate the copy number of BmTc to be less than 50 per haploid genome. From the B. mori EST databank, we have also found two clones (GenBankTM accession numbersAU004038 and AU004047) that have 88% and 89% nucleotide identities to the BmTc1 transposase-encoding region. In this study, nuclear localization activity of the DNA binding domain of BmTc1 putative transposase is shown (Fig. 9). EST clone (GenBankTM accession number AU004038) also contains an open reading frame encoding a homologous amino acid sequence (data not shown). Both BmTc1 and the EST clone possess stop codons in the 3′ region of the DNA binding domain coding sequences. Protein products of BmTc1 and the EST clone might act as dominant negatives to moderately suppress BmTc-type transposase in the cell nucleus of B. mori. Recently, transposon vectors have been created successfully by modifying the inactive Tc1-like elements found in Salmonid (38Ivics Z. Hackett P.B. Plasterk R.H. Izsvak Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). B. mori is an economically important species and is reared easily and cheaply on artificial diets. Protein production inB. mori larvae using the baculovirus system (39Maeda S. Kawai T. Obinata M. Fujiwara H. Horiuchi T. Saeki Y. Sato Y. Furusawa M. Nature. 1985; 315: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) has been shown to be quite efficient. BmTc elements have several favorable characteristics as the gene transfer vector of B. mori. The copy numbers of this element in the genome of B. mori are not too high, and the insertional sites should not be harmful to the viability of this organism. Moreover, the safety ofBmTc elements in the human has been tested, at least in part, through the history of silkworm breeding. BmTcelements could be suitable gene transfer vectors for generating transgenic B. mori and other organisms. We found TATA box sequences, CAAT box sequences, arthropod capsite sequences (TCAGT), and a putative open reading frame in most of the BmTc family members (data not shown). The BmTc elements we found have stop codons and missense mutations within their putative transposase-encoding region. We are now interested in the generation of a gene transfer vector based on the BmTc element family. In summary, we have cloned B. mori cDNA encoding chitinase of 544 amino acids, determined the genome structure of this gene, and found a novel DNA-type transposon in an intron of this gene in some strains of B. mori. We have also suggested nuclear localization activity of the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of the putative transposase and wide distribution of the homologous transposable elements in the genome of B. mori. We are grateful to the late Dr. Kazuhiko Umesono for his heartfelt encouragement of this work. We thank Dr. Haruhiko Fujiwara for kindly providing the EMBL3B. mori genomic DNA library. We also thank members of the Nuclear Receptor Unit at Novum for helpful discussions and members of the Gene Therapy Group at Novum for assistance in cell localization analysis."

Motion and spatial information flow into the dorsal pathway to be used for control of movements, while the shape, color, and texture information flow into the ventral pathway for identification of objects. Images of an object fall on slightly displaced locations of the left retina and right retina due to the horizontal separation of the two eyes, and this disparity can provide the position of the points in depth (see figure). The disparity information has been frequently found in cells at various stages in the dorsal pathway, but not very often in cells in the ventral pathway. Cells with selectivity for disparity constituted 70%–80% of cells in the thick cytochrome oxidase (CO) stripes of V2 and in MT along the dorsal pathway, while only 20%–30% of cells in the thin and pale CO stripes of V2 and in V4 along the ventral pathway showed such selectivity (2DeYoe E.A. Van Essen D.C Nature. 1985; 317: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). It was tempting to conclude that disparity depth information is mainly used as a spatial cue in the primate brain, as cells with disparity selectivity were mainly found in the dorsal pathway. However, by recording single-cell activities from passively fixating monkeys4Janssen P. Vogel R. Orban G.A Science. 2000; 288 (a): 2054-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 5Janssen P. Vogel R. Orban G.A Neuron. 2000; 27 (b this issue,): 387-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (148) Google Scholar( [this issue of Neuron]) and 11Uka T. Tanaka H. Yoshiyama K. Kato M. Fujita I J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 80: 120-132Google Scholar have found many cells in the inferotemporal cortex selectively responding to stimuli with disparity. Together with another set of recent findings that many cells in the parietal cortex selectively respond to particular complex 2-dimensional shapes (6Sakata H. Taira M. Kusunoki M. Murata A. Tanaka Y Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 350-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 8Sereno A.B. Maunsell J.H.R Nature. 1998; 395: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), the dorsal versus ventral dichotomy is now less distinct than it was thought to be previously. Information about surface orientation is useful to guide movements. For example, the reaching hand should be differently shaped depending on the orientation of the surfaces of the target objects. Indeed, Hideo Sakata's group has found that many cells in the caudal part of the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus selectively respond to surfaces of different tilt in depth (6Sakata H. Taira M. Kusunoki M. Murata A. Tanaka Y Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 350-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 9Taira M. Tsutsui K. Jiang M. Yara K. Sakata H J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 3140-3146PubMed Google Scholar). However, the information about the depth gradient is also useful to identify objects. A circular object with a concave depth profile is likely to be a bowl, while one with a convex profile is likely to be a ball. Correspondingly5Janssen P. Vogel R. Orban G.A Neuron. 2000; 27 (b this issue,): 387-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (148) Google Scholar have now found that many inferotemporal cells selectively respond to stimuli of particular depth profiles including those of concave and convex depth profiles. In general, it may be that the ranges of visual information submodalities used in the dorsal and ventral pathways largely overlap with each other just because they are useful for both guidance of movements and identification of objects. Cells in the inferotemporal cortex have been shown to respond to various complex shapes, and the selectivity has been explained in the 2-dimensional plane (10Tanaka K Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 109-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The findings of 5Janssen P. Vogel R. Orban G.A Neuron. 2000; 27 (b this issue,): 387-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (148) Google Scholar do not necessitate a full revision of this 2-dimensional description of the selectivity of inferotemporal cells to a complete 3-dimensional description, because the inferotemporal cells were much more sensitive to the polarity of the disparity gradient, e.g., concave versus convex, than the quantitative values of curvature or gradient. Rather than providing a full reconstruction of the 3-dimensional structure of the shape, the qualitative disparity gradient information just makes the 2-dimensional representation of object views richer. Most cells in the inferotemporal cortex respond to moderately complex features but not whole-object images, except faces (10Tanaka K Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 109-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar); the object images may be represented by combinations of such features. The number of independent features that can be represented in the inferotemporal cortex is limited by the number of columns (about 1000 in each hemisphere), in each of which cells respond to similar features (3Fujita I. Tanaka K. Ito M. Cheng K Nature. 1992; 360: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 12Wang G. Tanifuji M. Tanaka K Neurosci. Res. 1998; 32: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an object projects different view images to the observer's retina depending on the viewing angle. If all of the features contained in these different views had corresponding columns, there would be a serious shortage of columns. It seems that robust features—i.e., those that continue to exist regardless of small changes in the viewing angle—are preferentially represented in the inferotemporal cortex and earlier stages in the ventral pathway. The “concavity versus convexity” of the surface is one such robust feature. The representation of disparity gradient in the inferotemporal cortex may be not an extensive parametric one but a set of selected useful, robust canonicals. Cells with disparity selectivity were mainly found in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus. The proportion of such cells was much smaller in the lateral surface of the inferotemporal cortex (4Janssen P. Vogel R. Orban G.A Science. 2000; 288 (a): 2054-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that different regions of the inferotemporal cortex receive their visual inputs through separate afferent pathways, which run in parallel from the occipital lobe to the temporal lobe (1Boussaud D. Ungerleider L.G. Desimone R J. Comp. Neurol. 1990; 296: 462-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 7Saleem K.S. Suzuki W. Tanaka K. Hashikawa T J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5083-5101PubMed Google Scholar). The pathway running in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus has been characterized by the dominance of disparity selectivity. The characteristics of the other two pathways, one running in the middle temporal gyrus and the other running in the inferior temporal gyrus and the anterior middle temporal sulcus, are yet to be determined."
