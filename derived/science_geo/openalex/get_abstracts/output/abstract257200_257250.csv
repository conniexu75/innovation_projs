Whereas some of the protective effects may be explained by its chemical chaperone properties, its actions are largely unknown. Here we report a novel function of trehalose as an mTOR-independent autophagy activator. Trehalose-induced autophagy enhanced the clearance of autophagy substrates like mutant huntingtin and the A30P and A53T mutants of alpha-synuclein, associated with Huntington disease (HD) and Parkinson disease (PD), respectively. Furthermore, trehalose and mTOR inhibition by rapamycin together exerted an additive effect on the clearance of these aggregate-prone proteins because of increased autophagic activity. By inducing autophagy, we showed that trehalose also protects cells against subsequent pro-apoptotic insults via the mitochondrial pathway. The dual protective properties of trehalose (as an inducer of autophagy and chemical chaperone) and the combinatorial strategy with rapamycin may be relevant to the treatment of HD and related diseases, where the mutant proteins are autophagy substrates."

To explore the efficacy of p53 reinstatement as a tumor therapy, we used a reversibly switchable p53 knockin (KI) mouse model that permits modulation of p53 status from wild-type to knockout, at will. Using the well-characterized Eμ-myc lymphoma model, we show that p53 is spontaneously activated when restored in established Eμ-myc lymphomas in vivo, triggering rapid apoptosis and conferring a significant increase in survival. Nonetheless, reimposition of p53 function potently selects for emergence of p53-resistant tumors through inactivation of p19ARF or p53. Our study provides important insights into the nature and timing of p53-activating signals in established tumors and how resistance to p53 evolves, which will aid in the optimization of p53-based tumor therapies.

Our study provides important insights into the nature and timing of p53-activating signals in established tumors and how resistance to p53 evolves, which will aid in the optimization of p53-based tumor therapies. p53 is a transcription factor that triggers growth inhibitory and apoptotic responses to a wide range of insults, including DNA damage, stress, and oncogene activation. Inactivation of p53 function, or its attendant pathway, is a common feature of human tumors that often correlates with increased malignancy, poor patient survival, and resistance to treatment (Munro et al., 2005Munro A.J. Lain S. Lane D.P. P53 abnormalities and outcomes in colorectal cancer: a systematic review.Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 92: 434-444PubMed Google Scholar, Vogelstein et al., 2000Vogelstein B. Lane D.

Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, while strong selection against p53 function during tumorigenesis underscores the critical role that the p53 pathway plays in suppressing the emergence of incipient tumors, it tells us nothing about when and why such selection occurred during the protracted process of tumor evolution. The widely held “Guardian of the genome” (Lane, 1992Lane D.P. Cancer. p53, guardian of the genome.Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar) idea is that p53 suppresses tumorigenesis principally by mediating cellular responses to DNA damage, forestalling clonal accumulation of mutations by inducing death or arrest of damaged cells. If true, then absence of p53 is likely a transient requirement of early tumor initiation: once a tumor cell has acquired its requisite ensemble of mutations, p53 status may thenceforth be irrelevant. On the other hand, it may be that tumors harbor persistent and obligate p53-activating signals throughout their evolution, in which case absence of p53 is a continuous requirement for the maintenance of established tumors. The practical difference between these two ideas is profound: reinstatement of p53 function is an attractive tumor-specific therapeutic strategy (Bykov et al., 2003Bykov V.J. Selivanova G. Wiman K.G.

Chem. 2005; 48: 4491-4499Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), but it will only work if tumors harbor persistent p53-activating signals that engage growth inhibition or death. The p53-deficient mouse has proven invaluable in causally implicating p53 loss in spontaneous, oncogene- and mutagen-induced tumorigenesis and in resistance to anticancer drugs (Donehower et al., 1992Donehower L.A.

However, such models shed no light on when p53 inactivation is critical for the genesis and evolution of tumors nor on the likely impact of restoring p53 function in established tumors. Recently we described a unique, switchable p53 knockin (KI) mouse model (p53KI/KI) (Christophorou et al., 2005Christophorou M.A. Martin-Zanca D. Soucek L. Lawlor E.R. Brown-Swigart L. Verschuren E.W. Evan G.I. Temporal dissection of p53 function in vitro and in vivo.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) in which both copies of the endogenous p53 gene have been modified to encode the 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) dependent p53ERTAM protein, a fusion between p53 and a modified form of the estrogen receptor (Vater et al., 1996Vater C. Bartle L. Dionne C. Littlewood T. Goldmacher V. Induction of apoptosis by tamoxifen-activation of a p53-estrogen receptor fusion protein expressed in E1A and T24 H-ras transformed p53−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts.Oncogene. 1996; 13: 739-748PubMed Google Scholar). p53KI/KI mice can be reversibly and rapidly toggled between p53 wild-type (wt) and knockout states by, respectively, administration or withdrawal of 4-OHT (Christophorou et al., 2005Christophorou M.A. Martin-Zanca D. Soucek L. Lawlor E.R. Brown-Swigart L. Verschuren E.W. Evan G.I. Temporal dissection of p53 function in vitro and in vivo.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that p53ERTAM is rendered functionally competent within ∼1–2 hr of systemic 4-OHT administration, reverting back to a null state after ∼30 hr unless 4-OHT is readministered. Importantly, provision of 4-OHT to either p53KI/KI cells in vitro or tissues of p53KI/KI mice in vivo does not itself activate p53ERTAM but rather renders p53ERTAM competent to become activated should appropriate signals arise in such cells. Furthermore, by all tested criteria 4-OHT-ligated p53ERTAM is functionally equivalent to wt p53 (Ringshausen et al., 2006Ringshausen I. O'Shea C.C. Finch A.J. Brown Swigart L. Evan G.I. Mdm2 is critically and continuously required to suppress lethal p53 activity in vivo.Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 501-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the well-characterized Eμ-myc mouse model, transgenic expression of the Myc oncoprotein driven from the immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer leads to sporadic eruption of clonal B cell lineage lymphomas that closely resemble non-Hodgkin lymphoma in humans (Adams et al., 1985Adams J.M. Harris A.W. Pinkert C.A. Corcoran L.M. Alexander W.S. Cory S. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. The c-myc oncogene driven by immunoglobulin enhancers induces lymphoid malignancy in transgenic mice.Nature. 1985; 318: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar, Harris et al., 1988Harris A.W.

Med. 1988; 167: 353-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The sporadic incidence of such tumors confirms their dependence upon the aleatory acquisition of secondary cooperating mutations. Indeed, as in many human and mouse cancers, the p19ARF-Mdm2-p53 pathway is almost invariably inactivated in Eμ-myc lymphomas (Eischen et al., 1999Eischen C.M. Weber J.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cleveland J.L. Disruption of the ARF-Mdm2-p53 tumor suppressor pathway in Myc-induced lymphomagenesis.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, Schmitt et al., 1999Schmitt C.A. McCurrach M.E. de Stanchina E. Wallace-Brodeur R.R. Lowe S.W. INK4a/ARF mutations accelerate lymphomagenesis and promote chemoresistance by disabling p53.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), emphasizing the critical role of p53 in the intrinsic tumor suppressor response to deregulated Myc, as well as that of p19ARF as a mediator of that response (Zindy et al., 1998Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Myc signaling via the ARF tumor suppressor regulates p53-dependent apoptosis and immortalization.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The relevance of p53 inactivation for Myc-driven lymphomagenesis is confirmed by the greatly increased susceptibility of heterozygous p53+/− mice to Eμ-myc-induced lymphoma, 90% of which involve loss of the remaining p53 allele (Eischen et al., 1999Eischen C.M. Weber J.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cleveland J.L. Disruption of the ARF-Mdm2-p53 tumor suppressor pathway in Myc-induced lymphomagenesis.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, Schmitt et al., 1999Schmitt C.A.

INK4a/ARF mutations accelerate lymphomagenesis and promote chemoresistance by disabling p53.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). However, none of this speaks to whether inactivation of the p53 pathway is required early versus late or transiently versus continuously in Myc-driven lymphoma. To ascertain the impact of restoring p53 function in tumors that have sporadically lost p53 function during tumor evolution, we crossed the Eμ-myc transgene into p53KI/+ mice that carry one wt copy of p53 and one that is 4-OHT dependent. Tumors arise in such animals through sporadic inactivation of wt p53 function, recapitulating the sporadic loss of p53 in human tumors. However, the remaining switchable p53ERTAM allele can be functionally reinstated at any time, allowing us to ascertain the short- and long-term therapeutic impact of p53 restoration on established tumors. To explore the consequences of restoring p53 function in tumors that had evolved via sporadic p53 loss, we used a variation on the p53 heterozygous model in which Myc-driven tumorigenesis arises following sporadic inactivation of a single extant wt p53 allele. Lymphoma-prone Eμ-myc transgenic mice (Adams et al., 1985Adams J.M. Harris A.W. Pinkert C.A. Corcoran L.M. Alexander W.S. Cory S. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. The c-myc oncogene driven by immunoglobulin enhancers induces lymphoid malignancy in transgenic mice.Nature. 1985; 318: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) were crossed into the p53KI/+ background, which has one copy of wt p53 and one copy of the conditional, 4-OHT-dependent p53ERTAM allele (Christophorou et al., 2005Christophorou M.A. Martin-Zanca D. Soucek L. Lawlor E.R. Brown-Swigart L. Verschuren E.W. Evan G.I. Temporal dissection of p53 function in vitro and in vivo.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Incidence of spontaneous lymphomagenesis in such Eμ-Myc;p53KI/+ animals in the absence of 4-OHT treatment was then monitored. Survival of Eμ-myc;p53KI/+ was greatly reduced relative to that of Eμ-myc;p53+/+ mice (Eμ-myc) (Figure 1; p < 0.0001) and similar to that reported for Eμ-myc;p53+/− mice (Schmitt et al., 1999Schmitt C.A. McCurrach M.E. de Stanchina E. Wallace-Brodeur R.R. Lowe S.W. INK4a/ARF mutations accelerate lymphomagenesis and promote chemoresistance by disabling p53.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Thus, the p53ERTAM allele is nonfunctional in the absence of 4-OHT. The increased incidence of lymphomas in Eμ-myc;p53+/− animals is accompanied by frequent LOH (loss-of-heterozygosity) of the remaining wt p53 allele in tumors (Hsu et al., 1995Hsu B. Marin M.C. el-Naggar A.K. Stephens L.C. Brisbay S. McDonnell T.J. Evidence that c-myc mediated apoptosis does not require wild-type p53 during lymphomagenesis.Oncogene. 1995; 11: 175-179PubMed Google Scholar, Schmitt et al., 1999Schmitt C.A. McCurrach M.E. de Stanchina E. Wallace-Brodeur R.R. Lowe S.W. INK4a/ARF mutations accelerate lymphomagenesis and promote chemoresistance by disabling p53.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether the wt p53 allele is similarly lost in lymphomas arising in Eμ-Myc;p53KI/+ mice. Indeed, Southern blot analysis confirmed that 45% of such tumors had wt p53 deletions (Figure 2A). Moreover, sequence analysis (Table S1) revealed that 7/7 tested tumors that ostensibly retain the p53 wt allele harbor point mutations in the DNA binding domain consistent with functional inactivation (http://www.umd.be:2072) (Vousden and Lu, 2002Vousden K.H. Lu X. Live or let die: the cell's response to p53.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). Levels of mutant p53 protein were assayed in two of this latter class of tumors and found to be significantly elevated (Figure S1), as is typical of inactive p53 mutants in human cancers. To confirm directly that p53 function is absent from all lymphomas arising in Eμ-Myc;p53KI/+ mice, and that function of the p53ERTAM protein encoded by the residual p53KI allele can be restored, cells from both p53-retaining (no Δp53) and p53-deleted (Δp53) lymphomas were explanted onto feeder cells in vitro (Schmitt et al., 1999Schmitt C.A. McCurrach M.E. de Stanchina E. Wallace-Brodeur R.R. Lowe S.W. INK4a/ARF mutations accelerate lymphomagenesis and promote chemoresistance by disabling p53.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and 24 hr later exposed to either 4-OHT, to restore p53ERTAM function, or vehicle (ethanol). p53 activity in each of the two groups of tumors was assayed before and 2 hr after 4-OHT treatment by Taqman analysis of diagnostic p53 target genes (Vousden and Lu, 2002Vousden K.H. Lu X. Live or let die: the cell's response to p53.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). Figure 2B shows the relative expression of cdkn1a in three independent lymphomas representing each of the two lymphoma groups (Δp53 and no Δp53). In the absence of 4-OHT (0 hr 4-OHT), all tumors exhibited similar, baseline expression of cdkn1a. By contrast, restoration of p53 function (2 hr 4-OHT) dramatically induced cdkn1a to a similar degree in each tumor group. Equivalent induction was seen for both mdm2 and puma (Figure S2). Vehicle-treated cells showed no significant induction of p53 target genes relative to untreated controls (data not shown). Thus, all lymphomas from Eμ-Myc;p53KI/+ mice have inactivated wt p53 function, via deletion or mutation of the p53 wt allele but retain a functional, switchable p53ERTAM allele. Moreover, since p53ERTAM is spontaneously active when its function is restored, each of the lymphomas harbors constitutive p53-activating signals. To ascertain the consequences of restoring p53 function for proliferation and survival of lymphomas, cells derived from 14 independent tumors arising in Eμ-myc;p53KI/+ mice (five Δp53; nine no Δp53) were tested in a short-term in vitro proliferation/survival assay. As before, lymphoma cells were plated and 24 hr later either 4-OHT or vehicle added. All the lymphomas rapidly proliferated in the absence of 4-OHT, albeit with not unexpected differences in rate (Figure 2C; Ctrl). Furthermore, all shared a high index of viability (≥80%) prior to high confluence (typically ∼day 3; data not shown). In contrast, 13/14 (93%) of the tested lymphoma cells underwent massive apoptosis upon restoration of p53 function with 4-OHT (Figure 2C; 4-OHT). Importantly, 4-OHT treatment of control Eμ-myc tumor cells arising in p53+/+ mice had no effect on either lymphoma cell proliferation or survival, indicating that none of the effects observed is due to 4-OHT itself (Figure 2D). Our data demonstrate that, similarly to the situation in tumors arising in Eμ-myc;p53+/− mice (Schmitt et al., 1999Schmitt C.A. McCurrach M.E. de Stanchina E. Wallace-Brodeur R.R. Lowe S.W. INK4a/ARF mutations accelerate lymphomagenesis and promote chemoresistance by disabling p53.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), lymphomas arising in Eμ-myc;p53KI/+ mice are functionally null for p53 in the absence of 4-OHT. Importantly, in the great majority (93%) of Eμ-myc;p53KI/null tumors, all components of the p53 pathway save p53, including constitutive upstream p53-activating signals and downstream apoptotic p53 effector pathways, remain intact. Since we observed no consistent differences between the two (Δp53 and no Δp53) lymphoma groups in their sensitivities to p53 restoration, we can exclude the possibility of dominant-negative p53 mutations in those no Δp53 tumors tested in vitro. Both groups of tumors were therefore considered appropriate for use in subsequent analyses and are hereafter referred to as Eμ-myc;p53KI/null. Our in vitro data showed that Eμ-myc;p53KI/null lymphomas retain a functional, switchable p53ERTAM allele, which is lethal to lymphoma cells once its function is restored. We next addressed the therapeutic impact of p53 restoration in established lymphomas in vivo. This cannot be easily addressed in autocthonous tumors in Eμ-Myc mice, since the response of a primary tumor to treatment can be obscured by the outgrowth of a secondary malignancy. Fortunately, Eμ-Myc lymphomas can be serially transplanted into syngeneic mice, where they expand into tumors that closely resemble their primary forebear (Harris et al., 1988Harris A.W. Pinkert C.A. Crawford M. Langdon W.Y. Brinster R.L. Adams J.M. The E mu-myc transgenic mouse. A model for high-incidence spontaneous lymphoma and leukemia of early B cells.J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 353-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, Schmitt et al., 2000Schmitt C.A. Rosenthal C.T. Lowe S.W. Genetic analysis of chemoresistance in primary murine lymphomas.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To exploit the obvious advantages in experimental tractability and reproducibility of this approach, we separately transplanted Eμ-Myc;p53KI/null lymphoma cells derived from three independent primary tumors (6, 29, 68) into wt recipient mice by intravenous injection (i.v.) and allowed tumors to develop until palpable (typically 13–20 days posttransplantation). At this stage, animals were randomized into two groups and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with either Tamoxifen (Tam) or control vehicle (Oil) and sacrificed 6 hr later. Lymphomas cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry for DNA content (Propidium iodide, PI) and viability (AnnexinV/PI) to determine the immediate in vivo impact of p53 restoration on tumor maintenance. Representative data from Oil- and Tam-treated lymphomas are shown in Figure 3A. Control-treated tumors (6 hr Oil) show a DNA profile typical of rapidly proliferating cells together with a modest sub-G1 population, the size of which varies between different primary tumors (not shown). By contrast, the DNA profile from Tam-treated tumors in which p53 function had been restored for 6 hr (6 hr Tam) shows significant depletion of S and G2 populations, together with a substantial sub-G1 population indicative of loss of viability (Figure 3A; left panels). Annexin V/PI staining of the same cells (Figure 3A; middle panels) confirmed widespread apoptosis in tumors from Tam-treated mice, with the percentage of viable cells falling to 6.5% within only 6 hr of p53 restoration (lower left quadrants). We also assayed directly for apoptosis in tumor tissue by TUNEL staining. This confirmed the dramatic extent of cell death that rapidly follows restoration of p53 function to Eμ-myc;p53KI/null lymphoma cells in vivo (Figure 3A, right panels; Figure S3). Systematic analysis of the impact of p53 restoration on lymphoma viability at later (>6 hr) time points was confounded by frequent morbidity of Tam-treated animals, most probably due to tumor lysis syndrome (Del Toro et al., 2005Del Toro G. Morris E. Cairo M.S. Tumor lysis syndrome: pathophysiology, definition, and alternative treatment approaches.Clin. Adv. Hematol. Oncol. 2005; 3: 54-61PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we can conclude that, as observed in vitro, p53 is spontaneously active in vivo upon functional restoration in Eμ-myc;p53KI/null lymphomas, triggering rapid and widespread tumor cell apoptosis. The robust tumor suppressive effect we observe in vivo upon reinstatement of p53 function in established Eμ-myc;p53KI/null lymphomas suggests that p53 restoration should have a profound therapeutic impact on long-term survival of affected animals. To test this directly, we again transplanted Eμ-myc;p53KI/null primary lymphomas into wt recipients and randomly assigned them into control and Tam-treatment groups (see scheme in Figure 3B). To accommodate likely variability in responses between different primary lymphomas, we independently tested four Eμ-Myc;p53KI/null primary lymphomas (Δp53: 6, 68; no Δp53: 26, 29). To decrease the mortality from catastrophic tumor lysis, p53 function was restored 10 days posttransplantation, at which stage lymphomas are not yet palpable. Daily treatments (Tam or Oil) were then maintained for a total of 7 days. Essentially identical responses were obtained with each of the four primary tumors tested, allowing us to combine the data obtained from all transplanted mice into a single survival curve (Figure 3C). Control mice succumb to lethal tumors between days 14 and 25 after transplantation, with a mean survival of 18.6 days. By contrast, Tam-treated mice die of lymphomas between days 23 and 40 posttransplantation, a 28 day mean survival. Thus, 7 day in vivo restoration of p53 in Eμ-myc;p53KI/null lymphomas has a significant therapeutic impact (p < 0.0001), markedly delaying tumor onset and conferring a 50% (9.4 days) increase in mean survival. The recurrence of lymphomas in Tam-treated mice indicates that, despite the dramatic proapoptotic impact of p53 restoration, sufficient tumor cells escape to regenerate a tumor. Escape of tumor cells could arise either through chance or due to the presence of a constitutively p53-resistant subpopulation, perhaps refractory tumor stem cells or preexisting p53-resistant clones. To distinguish between these possibilities, we assayed the sensitivity of the recurring, secondary tumors to p53 restoration. Established secondary lymphomas harvested both from control and Tam-treated mice (hereafter termed Post-Oil and Post-Tam tumors, respectively) were cultured in vitro in the presence or absence of 4-OHT. To accommodate any intertumor variation, we assayed the growth and viability of 10 Post-Oil and 16 Post-Tam lymphomas, derived from all four of the primary Eμ-myc;p53KI/null lymphomas used in our in vivo study. Representative data is shown in Figure 4. Similarly to the primary tumors from which they were derived (Figure 2C), all Post-Oil tumors were rapidly killed upon exposure to 4-OHT (Figures 4A and 4B; Post-Oil lymphoma). By contrast, all 16 Post-Tam tumors continued to survive and proliferate in the presence of 4-OHT (Figures 4A and 4B; Post-Tam lymphomas), each growing at a rate at least that of its vehicle-treated Post-Oil lymphomas counterpart. Of note, we observed some variation in resistance of Post-Tam tumors to 4-OHT amongst the tumors: whereas some Post-Tam lymphomas were completely refractory to 4-OHT (Figure 4A; right panels), others showed a slightly decreased propagation rate in its presence—most probably due to decreased viability (Figure 4A; middle panels). We can nonetheless conclude that transient exposure to p53 function efficiently selects for outgrowth of 4-OHT-resistant Eμ-myc;p53KI/null lymphoma clones. Eμ-myc;p53KI/null Post-Tam tumors could in principle acquire resistance to 4-OHT by one of several mechanisms. First, p53ERTAM itself might be inactivated. Second, the pathway linking Myc with p53 might be severed, most plausibly through loss/inactivation of p19ARF. Third, critical, nonredundant downstream p53 apoptotic/arrest effector pathways might become corrupted. Fourth, it is formally possible that tumor cells uptake of 4-OHT could be compromised by multidrug resistance. To discriminate between these possibilities, we first assessed by immunoblotting the status of the Myc/p19ARF/p53 axis in Post-Oil and Post-Tam secondary lymphomas derived from all four primary tumors used in our study. As shown in Figure 5A, levels of Myc were comparable in all tumors analyzed, regardless of treatment, and consistent with a continuous requirement for Myc in lymphoma maintenance. Furthermore, all Post-Oil (O) lymphomas expressed high levels of p19ARF as well as detectable levels of p53ERTAM protein. By contrast, Post-Tam lymphomas exhibited one of two distinct mechanisms of resistance to p53 restoration. In one group of Post-Tam tumors (derived from primary lymphomas 6 and 47), p19ARF protein was absent, while p53ERTAM remained detectable. The majority of these tumors showed complete (5/8) or partial (2/8) deletion of the p19ARF alleles (Figure 5B), and in all cases, ARF mRNA expression was also lost (Figure 5C and not shown). In the second group (derived from primary lymphomas 26 and 29), p19ARF levels remained high but p53ERTAM protein was absent. Of note, this latter group corresponded to the lymphomas that showed complete refractoriness to 4-OHT restoration in the short-term survival studies, whereas the p19ARF-deficient tumors often retained some sensitivity (Figure 4A; right and middle panels respectively). Southern blot analysis confirmed that the p53ERTAM allele had, in fact, been deleted in this second group (Figure 5D). Interestingly, all Post-Tam secondary tumors that originate from a common primary Eμ-myc;p53KI/null lymphoma evolve 4-OHT resistance by the same route—one class losing p19ARF and the other p53ERTAM (Figures 5B and 5D and data not shown). Thus, some preexisting constraint dictates the route by which resistance evolves. The above data illustrate three important features of the selective pressure that p53 restoration imposes on Eμ-myc-induced lymphomas. First, even short-term restoration of p53 function in established tumors imposes powerful selection for inactivation of the p53 pathway. Second, while it is formally possible that the p53-resistant lymphoma variants could have evolved de novo after p53 was deactivated at the end of treatment, the efficiency and rapidity with which resistant disease appears suggests that a significant reservoir of p53-resistant cells preexists prior to imposition of selection. Third, the comparable likelihoods with which p19 ARF and p53ERTAM are lost indicate that counter-selection targets the whole p19 ARF -p53 pathway rather than favouring p53 preferentially. This is intriguing, given that p19ARF loss incapacitates only one of multiple p53-activating pathways that plausibly exist in an established tumor cell. Our data indicate that inactivation of p19ARF is a frequent mechanism by which established lymphomas acquire resistance to the therapeutic impact of p53 functional restoration. However, while inactivation of p19ARF uncouples p53 from the constitutively activating oncogenic signal generated by Myc, it leaves p53 function intact and, potentially, accessible for therapeutic activation by other signals such as DNA damage (Kamijo et al., 1997Kamijo T.

We therefore tested whether p53 can still be activated to therapeutic effect in p19ARF-deficient Post-Tam lymphomas.

https://openalex.org/W2060656527,"Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite of the phylum Apicomplexa, can cause severe disease in humans with an immature or suppressed immune system. The outcome of Toxoplasma infection is highly dependent on the strain type, as are many of its in vitro growth properties. Here we use genetic crosses between type II and III lines to show that strain-specific differences in the modulation of host cell transcription are mediated by a putative protein kinase, ROP16. Upon invasion by the parasite, this polymorphic protein is released from the apical organelles known as rhoptries and injected into the host cell, where it ultimately affects the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling pathways and consequent downstream effects on a key host cytokine, interleukin (IL)-12. Our findings provide a new mechanism for how an intracellular eukaryotic pathogen can interact with its host and reveal important differences in how different Toxoplasma lineages have evolved to exploit this interaction."

We have studied possible links between metabolic pathways and HIF hydroxylases by analyzing the abilities of citric acid cycle intermediates to inhibit purified human HIF-P4Hs and FIH.

Oxaloacetate was an additional inhibitor of all three HIF-P4Hs with Ki values of 400–1000 μm and citrate of HIF-P4H-3, citrate being the most effective inhibitor of FIH with a Ki of 110 μm. Culturing of cells with fumarate diethyl or dimethyl ester, or a high concentration of monoethyl ester, stabilized HIF-1α and increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor and erythropoietin.

We have studied possible links between metabolic pathways and HIF hydroxylases by systematically analyzing the abilities of citric acid cycle intermediates and other aliphatic 2-oxoglutarate analogues to inhibit purified human HIF-P4Hs and FIH under initial velocity conditions and in the presence of saturating peptide substrate concentrations in vitro. Fumarate and succinate were identified as inhibitors of all three HIF-P4Hs, fumarate having Ki values of 50–80 μm and succinate 350–460 μm, whereas neither inhibited FIH to any significant extent even at a 10 mm concentration. Oxaloacetate was an additional inhibitor of all three HIF-P4Hs with Ki values of 400–1000 μm and citrate was an inhibitor of HIF-P4H-3 with a Ki of 180 μm, whereas pyruvate and many other 2-oxoglutarate analogues showed no inhibition of any of the HIF-P4Hs even at a 10 mm concentration, variations in ascorbate levels having no effect on inhibition by oxaloacetate or pyruvate. FIH was inhibited most effectively by citrate and oxaloacetate with Ki values of 110 and 400 μm, respectively. Our further experiments using culturing of cells with fumarate diethyl ester or dimethyl ester, which pass through cell membranes, led to stabilization of HIF-1α and to increases in VEGF production in all the cell types studied and in Epo production in human hepatocellular carcinoma Hep3B cells. Similar, although much smaller, changes were found in cultured skin fibroblasts from a patient with autosomal recessive FH deficiency and in cells transfected with FH siRNA. No such effects were seen upon culturing of cells with succinate diethyl ester or dimethyl ester.

This method makes it possible to measure HIF-P4H activities under true initial velocity conditions and using saturating peptide substrate concentrations, and therefore the values obtained are often somewhat different from those obtained in assays involving capture of hydroxylated HIF-α or a fragment of this by pVHL. (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 was used as the substrate for a purified recombinant human type I C-P4H (23.Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Marttila M. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7467-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The Ki values were determined by adding the 2-oxoglutarate analogues at four constant concentrations while varying the concentration of 2-oxoglutarate or the peptide substrate. Stabilization of HIF-1α by Diethyl Fumarate and Dimethyl Fumarate in Cultured Cells−Human embryonic kidney (HEK293), hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep3B), and neuroblastoma (Kelly) cells, and fibroblasts (CRL-2086) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco’s (Biochrom) or Eagle’s (Sigma) minimal essential medium or in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioClear) and 50 μg/ml ascorbate. They were then subcultured at a density of 1 × 105 or 1.6 × 104 cells/cm2 in the case of fibroblasts, grown overnight, and incubated for 8–20 h with increasing concentrations of diethyl fumarate, dimethyl fumarate, monoethyl fumarate, diethyl succinate, or dimethyl succinate (Sigma). In control experiments the cells were treated with 300–500 μm cobalt or subjected to hypoxia by culturing in an airtight incubator (Billups-Rothenberg) under 1% O2 balanced with N2. The viability of cells was determined using trypan blue dye exclusion. Skin fibroblasts from a patient with a homozygous loss of function mutation in the FH gene (24.Remes A.M. Filppula S.A.

Med. 2004; 82: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and fibroblasts from a healthy control were cultured in Dulbecco’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Medium samples were collected for analysis of the production of VEGF and Epo (see below) and total cell extracts were obtained by lysing the cells in 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the NE-PER nuclear extraction reagent (Pierce). The extracts were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody against human HIF-1α (BD Biosciences) and ECL™ immunodetection. Antibodies to α tubulin (total extracts, Sigma) and β actin (nuclear extracts, Novus Biologicals) were used as loading controls. RNA Interference−Four siRNAs of the FH coding sequence (set of 4 siGENOME™ duplexes, Dharmacon) were transfected at 75 nm concentration into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Silencer™ GAPDH and Silencer negative control siRNAs (Ambion) were used as controls. Medium samples were collected 48 h after transfection, and total RNA and protein were isolated from the cells using the PARIS™ kit (Ambion). The ability of FH siRNAs to down-regulate FH mRNA was studied by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR using the SMART™ PCR cDNA synthesis kit (BD Biosciences). PCR was carried out under the following conditions: 1 min at 94 °C followed by 22 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. The primers used for amplification were: 5′-GGAGGTGTGACAGAACGCATGCCACC-3′ and 5′-GCTGCCTTGTCATACCCTATATGAGG-3′. Stabilization of HIF-1α was analyzed by Western blotting of the protein samples as described above. Analysis of the Production of VEGF and Epo−The VEGF and Epo concentrations in the medium samples were measured using the Quantikine human VEGF and Epo immunoassays (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 14.0 for Windows. Determination of Cellular Fumarate Concentrations−Equal numbers of HEK293 cells were incubated in the absence and presence of 40 μm diethyl fumarate for 20 h, the culture medium was carefully removed, and the cell pellets were immediately cooled in liquid N2. The frozen pellets were lysed in 8% cold perchloric acid and centrifuged. The supernatant was collected and the remaining pellet was washed and extracted with 6% perchloric acid and centrifuged. The supernatants were pooled and neutralized by K2CO3 and used to determine the amount of fumarate with fumarase, malate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase (Sigma) with a Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, Inc., Edison, NJ) as described previously (25.Williamson J.R.

Open table in a new tab Inhibition of the purified recombinant HIF-P4Hs and FIH was studied using six citric acid cycle intermediates and 10 other aliphatic 2-oxoglutarate analogues (Table 1). The IC50 values of the HIF-P4Hs and FIH were first determined in the presence of 10 and 50–100 μm 2-oxoglutarate, respectively. Fumarate was found to be the most efficient inhibitor of the three HIF-P4Hs, with IC50 values of 120, 80, and 60 μm for HIF-P4Hs 1, 2, and 3, respectively, whereas succinate had IC50 values of 830, 510, and 570 μm (Table 1). The IC50 values of HIF-P4Hs 1, 2, and 3 for oxaloacetate were 1, 3.8, and 1.2 mm, respectively, and those for citrate 6.3, 4.8, and 0.55 mm, whereas the IC50 values for pyruvate, malate, isocitrate, 2-oxoadipinate, 2-oxovalerate, 2-oxobutyrate, adipinate, glutarate, malonate, 3-oxoglutarate, levulinate, and lactate were at least 10 mm for all three isoenzymes, except that glutarate had an IC50 of about 6 mm for HIF-P4H-3 and 3-oxoglutarate had an IC50 of about 5 mm for HIF-P4H-2 (Table 1). FIH was inhibited most effectively by citrate, with an IC50 of 850 μm (Table 1). The IC50 values of FIH for oxaloacetate and isocitrate were about 1.4 and 5 mm, respectively, whereas those of all the other compounds tested, including fumarate, succinate, and pyruvate were at least 10 mm (Table 1). Inhibition of the HIF-P4Hs by fumarate, succinate, oxaloacetate, and citrate, the compounds with the lowest IC50 values among those tested, and of FIH by citrate and oxaloacetate, its most effective inhibitors, was analyzed in more detail. The mode of inhibition and Ki values were determined by adding fumarate, succinate, oxaloacetate, or citrate at four constant concentrations while varying the concentration of 2-oxoglutarate or the peptide substrate. The inhibition was found to be competitive with respect to 2-oxoglutarate (as shown for fumarate with HIF-P4Hs 2 and 3, succinate with HIF-P4H-1, and citrate with FIH in Fig. 1, A–D) and noncompetitive with respect to the peptide substrate (data not shown). The Ki values of HIF-P4Hs 1, 2, and 3 for fumarate were 80, 60, and 50 μm, respectively, and those for succinate 350, 460, and 430 μm, whereas the values for oxaloacetate ranged from 400 to 1000 μm and the Ki values of HIF-P4H-2 and HIF-P4H-3 for citrate were 1800 and 180 μm, respectively (Table 1). The Ki values of FIH for citrate and oxaloacetate were 110 and 400 μm, respectively, whereas those for fumarate and succinate were more than 10 mm (Table 1). Succinate, oxaloacetate, and citrate have also been reported (26.Majamaa K. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Günzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2065421417,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are known to come in two duration classes, separated at approximately 2 s. Long-duration bursts originate from star-forming regions in galaxies, have accompanying supernovae when these are near enough to observe and are probably caused by massive-star collapsars. Recent observations show that short-duration bursts originate in regions within their host galaxies that have lower star-formation rates, consistent with binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole mergers. Moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no supernovae have been so far associated with short-duration GRBs. Here we report that the bright, nearby GRB 060614 does not fit into either class. Its approximately 102-s duration groups it with long-duration GRBs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely within the short-duration GRB subclass. Moreover, very deep optical observations exclude an accompanying supernova, similar to short-duration GRBs. This combination of a long-duration event without an accompanying supernova poses a challenge to both the collapsar and the merging-neutron-star interpretations and opens the door to a new GRB classification scheme that straddles both long- and short-duration bursts."

The final nail in its coffin may be GRB 060614. Discovered on 14 June 2006 by the Burst Alert Telescope on-board the Swift satellite, this burst was long, at 102 seconds, but as reported in a clutch of papers in this issue, it has a number of properties, including the absence of an accompanying supernova, that were previously considered diagnostic of a 'short' GRB. The hunt is now on for a classification system to take account of the diversity now apparent in GRBs. In the accompanying News & Views, Bing Zhang suggests that the answer may be to adopt a Type I/Type II classification similar to that used for supernovae. GRB 060505 and GRB 060614 were not accompanied by supernova emission down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal SN 1998bw that accompanied GRB 980425, and fainter than any type Ic supernova ever observed. It is now accepted that long-duration γ-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced during the collapse of a massive star1,2. The standard ‘collapsar’ model3 predicts that a broad-lined and luminous type Ic core-collapse supernova accompanies every long-duration GRB4. This association has been confirmed in observations of several nearby GRBs5–9. Here we report that GRB 060505 (ref. 10) and GRB 060614 (ref. 11) were not accompanied by supernova emission down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal supernova SN 1998bw that accompanied GRB 980425, and fainter than any type Ic supernova ever observed12. Multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of the host galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and show that the bursts originated in actively star-forming regions. The absence of a supernova to such deep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long-duration GRBs and suggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death."
https://openalex.org/W2070615515,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short, intense flashes of soft gamma-rays coming from the distant Universe. Long-duration GRBs (those lasting more than approximately 2 s) are believed to originate from the deaths of massive stars, mainly on the basis of a handful of solid associations between GRBs and supernovae. GRB 060614, one of the closest GRBs discovered, consisted of a 5-s hard spike followed by softer, brighter emission that lasted for approximately 100 s (refs 8, 9). Here we report deep optical observations of GRB 060614 showing no emerging supernova with absolute visual magnitude brighter than M(V) = -13.7. Any supernova associated with GRB 060614 was therefore at least 100 times fainter, at optical wavelengths, than the other supernovae associated with GRBs. This demonstrates that some long-lasting GRBs can either be associated with a very faint supernova or produced by different phenomena."

Optical observations of γ-ray burst (GRB) 060614 (duration ∼100s) rule out the presence of an associated supernova. This would seem to require a new explosive process: either a massive 'collapsar' that powers a GRB without any associated supernova, or a new type of engine, as long-lived as the collapsar but without a massive star. Over the past decade, our physical understanding of γ-ray bursts (GRBs) has progressed rapidly, thanks to the discovery and observation of their long-lived afterglow emission. Long-duration (≳2 s) GRBs are associated with the explosive deaths of massive stars (‘collapsars’, ref. 1), which produce accompanying supernovae2,3,4,5; the short-duration (≲2 s) GRBs have a different origin, which has been argued to be the merger of two compact objects6,7,8,9. Here we report optical observations of GRB 060614 (duration ∼100 s, ref. 10) that rule out the presence of an associated supernova. This would seem to require a new explosive process: either a massive collapsar that powers a GRB without any associated supernova, or a new type of ‘engine’, as long-lived as the collapsar but without a massive star. We also show that the properties of the host galaxy (redshift z = 0.125) distinguish it from other long-duration GRB hosts and suggest that an entirely new type of GRB progenitor may be required."

Proc. 1961; 20: 934-940PubMed Google Scholar) in 1961 but is also generated from LPC by a remodeling pathway. Rapid turnover of the sn-2 acyl moiety of glycerophospholipids was described by Lands (Lands’ cycle) (24Lands W.E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2233-2237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lands W.E.M. Merkl I. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 898-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Merkl I. Lands W.E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 905-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is attributed to activation of phospholipases A2 and lysophospholipid acyltransferases. Recently, we (27Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20140-20147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and Chen et al. (28Chen X. Hyatt B.A. Mucenski M.L. Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 11724-11729Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) independently cloned one of LPC acyltransferases designated LPCAT1, which is highly expressed in alveolar type II cells. Since PC synthesis occurs in a variety of different tissues, additional LPC acyltransferases may be present for membrane biogenesis. Using the previously reported LPCAT1 (27Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20140-20147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and an extensive genomic data base search as well as 5′- and 3′-RACE, we have identified a lyso-PAF acetyltransferase gene. The enzyme is primarily expressed in inflammatory cells and is induced by LPS. Surprisingly, the enzyme also catalyzes incorporation of arachidonoyl-CoA to produce PAF precursor membrane glycerophospholipids (LPC acyltransferase activity). Thus, we designated this enzyme LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2. Although this enzyme possesses both acetyltransferase and acyltransferase activity, only the acetyltransferase activity was enhanced by acute inflammatory signals. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of a cDNA for LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2, a critically important enzyme in the biogenesis of PAF and in membrane homeostasis of inflammatory cells. Materials—Various lysophospholipids and acyl-CoAs were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). LPS from Salmonella minnesota, 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, dexamethasone (DEX), estradiol-17β, and linoleoyl-CoA (C18:2) were purchased from Sigma. [3H]Acetyl-CoA (185 GBq/mmol) and [3H]lyso-PAF (6.25 TBq/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). [1-14C]Arachidonoyl-CoA (2.22 GBq/mmol) was purchased from Moravec Biochemicals (Mercury Lane, CA). ODN1826 and poly(I:C) were purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). Cloning of LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2—The mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 gene was identified based upon sequence similarity to the LPCAT1 gene (27Nakanishi H. Shindou H. Hishikawa D. Harayama T. Ogasawara R. Suwabe A. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20140-20147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and LPA acyltransferase ζ gene (29Li D. Yu L. Wu H. Shan Y. Guo J. Dang Y. Wei Y. Zhao S. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 48: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) through a comprehensive basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) search. A 1.6-kb cDNA clone encoding the full-length mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 (DDBJ accession number AB244716) was cloned by PCR amplification using the forward primer 5′-CTAGCTAGCCACCATGGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAGAACCGATGCGCCGAGGCGGCCGC-3′, the reverse primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGTCCACCTTTTTGTCTGAGGTGCCCTC-3′, and a mouse spleen cDNA library as a template. The FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was attached to the N terminus of mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 by PCR using a forward primer. Amplified PCR products were cloned into the pCXN2.1 vector, a slightly modified version of pCXN2 (30Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar) with multiple cloning sites, and sequenced. Similarly, hLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 cDNA (DDBJ accession number AB244718) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pCXN2.1 vector. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR—Mouse total RNAs were prepared using the Absolutely RNA RT-PCR Miniprep Kit (Stratagene), and first strand cDNA was subsequently synthesized using Superscript II (Invitrogen). The PCRs were performed using FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science). The primers for mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 were designed to amplify a 167-bp fragment: forward primer, 5′-GTCCAGCAGACTACGATCAGTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTTATTGGATGGGTCAGCTTTTC-3′. The primers for hLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 were designed to amplify a 176-bp fragment: forward primer, 5′-TTGCTTCCAATTCGTGTCTTATT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ATCCCATTGAAAAGAACATAGCA-3′. Expression of FLAG-mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 in CHO-K1 Cells—After 48 h of transfection with FLAG-tagged enzyme using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), cells in 10-cm dishes were scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm sucrose, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture, Complete (Roche Applied Science), and then sonicated three times on ice for 30 s. After centrifugation for 10 min at 800 × g, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), using a commercially prepared protein assay solution (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin (fraction V, fatty acid-free; Sigma) as a standard. Confocal Microscopy—CHO-K1 cells were seeded onto 6-cm dishes before transfection. Six μg each of pCXN2.1 vector or FLAG-mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000. 48 h post-transfection, vector- or FLAG-tagged enzyme-transfected cells were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3)) (Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml M5 anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in ¼× permeabilization buffer (Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France). After washing, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG (Eugene, OR) for 30 min. Confocal microscopy was performed with an LSM510 laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a ×63 water immersion objective lens (numerical aperture = 1.2). FLAG-mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 was monitored by excitation at 543 nm with a helium/neon laser and by emission with a 585-nm long path filter. For the detection of DiOC6(3), the excitation was at 488 nm with an argon laser, and emissions were taken with a 505–550-nm band pass filter. Assay of Lyso-PAF Acetyltransferase—The lyso-PAF acetyltransferase activity was determined according to the method of Kume et al. (20Kume K. Waga I. Shimizu T. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), except for washing resin one time before and eight times after application of the reaction mixture. Briefly, 100 μm [3H]acetyl-CoA (1.11 GBq/mmol) and protein were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of 20 μm lyso-PAF (Cayman). Subsequently, the product was bound to C8 resin (Millipore), washed, and eluted. The difference between the radioactivities obtained in the presence and absence of lyso-PAF corresponded to lyso-PAF acetyltransferase activity. Assay of Lysophospholipid Acetyltransferase and Acyltransferase by TLC—The acyltransferase activity was measured in two ways: (i) conversion of [1-14C]lyso-PAF (293 MBq/mmol) to PC in the presence of acetyl- and acyl-CoA and (ii) the transfer of [3H]acetyl-CoA (1.11 GBq/mmol)- or [14C]arachidonoyl-CoA (1.11–2.035 GBq/mmol) to lysophospholipids to form phospholipids. The reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml PC, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 μm 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), a proteinase inhibitor mixture, 10 or 100 μm acyl-CoA, 20 μm lysophospholipid, and enzyme in a total volume of 100 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). Total lipids were extracted using the Bligh-Dyer method (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) and subsequently analyzed by TLC in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:25:8:4, v/v/v/v). Bands at positions corresponding to the expected product were visualized by I2 vapor, cut from the plate, placed in Microscinti-O (Packard Bioscience), and analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter LS6500 (Beckman). Radioligand Binding Assay—The method of PAF-PAF receptor (PAFR) binding assay was described previously (7Shindou H. Ishii S. Uozumi N. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Aoki Y. Nakamura M. Kodama H. Matsumoto T. Shimizu T. Noma M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 186: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane fraction containing 158 fmol of PAFR from hearts and skeletal muscles of PAFR transgenic mice (7Shindou H. Ishii S. Uozumi N. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Ishii S. Nagase T. Tashiro F. Ikuta K. Sato S. Waga I. Kume K. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) were mixed with 25 nm [3H]WEB 2086 and the lipid extract in a 96-well plate. After incubation at 25 °C for 90 min, receptor-bound [3H]WEB 2086 was collected by filtration through a UniFilter-GF/C (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a MicroMate 196 simultaneous 96-well harvester (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the filter was washed and dried. Subsequently, the radioactivities were counted with a TopCount microplate scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry Analysis of PAF— Extracted lipid from the acetyltransferase assay was identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis. The analysis was performed using a 4000 Q-TRAP quadrupole-linear ion trap hybrid mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Concord, Canada) with an Ultimate 3000 high pressure liquid chromatography system (DIONEX Co.) combined with an HTC PAL autosampler (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland). The extracted lipids were subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis by flow injection without liquid chromatography separation. The solvent was acetonitrile, methanol, 50 mm ammonium formate, pH 7.4 (v/v/v, 45/50/5), and the flow rate was 10 μl/min. The scan range and speed were set at m/z 500–600 and 1000 Da/s, respectively. The trap fill time was set at 5 ms, and the ion spray voltage was set at -4500 V in the negative ion mode. Nitrogen was used as curtain and collision gas. The declustering potential was set at 20 V to minimize in-source fragmentation. Both Q1 and Q3 resolution were set to unit mass. The collision energy used was varied according to the desired experiment. The method to identify phosphatidylcholine species was described previously (35Houjou T. Yamatani K. Nakanishi H. Imagawa M. Shimizu T. Taguchi R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 18: 3123-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). siRNA Transfection—hLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 siRNAs (siRNA ID numbers 140446, 140447, and 140448; Ambion) and control siRNA (silencer negative control 1; Ambion) were transfected using siPORT amine transfection agent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The siRNA transfection was performed for 2 days in HEK293 cells. Short Term LPS Stimulation—After transfection of RAW264.7 cells with LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 using Lipofectamine 2000, cells were pretreated with or without 20 μm SB 203580 for 1 h and subsequently stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 30 min. For preparation of cell extracts, the cells were scraped into 600 μl of an ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 7.4), 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 μm 4-amidino-phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and Complete, and the collected cells were sonicated twice on ice for 30 s. Intact cells, cellular debris, and mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 9000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Enzyme activities were measured as described above. Isolation and Stimulation of Mouse Peritoneal Cells—Mouse peritoneal macrophages induced by thioglycollate (Difco) was prepared as described in detail previously (11Shindou H. Ishii S. Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Shimizu T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with 100 ng/ml LPS, 0.8 μm ODN1826, or 1 μg/ml poly(I:C), in the presence or absence of 100 nm DEX or 100 nm estradiol-17β for 16 h. After treatment, the cells were washed with an ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 300 mm sucrose. Cell extracts were prepared by the same method as described for experiments using RAW264.7 cells, and the enzyme activity was measured. After treatment with microbial components for 16 h, total RNA was collected using the Absolutely RNA RT-PCR miniprep kit. Likewise, at 4 h after intraperitoneal injection with 2 ml of 2% casein, peritoneal exudate neutrophils were harvested from the peritoneal cavity, and their total RNA was prepared. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. or S.D. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical calculations were performed using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software) and StatView-J, version 5.0 (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Mice—C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Clea Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Mice were maintained in a light-dark cycle with light from 8:00 to 20:00 at 21 °C. Mice were fed with a standard laboratory diet and water ad libitum. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines for Animal Research at The University of Tokyo and were approved by the University of Tokyo Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments. Identification and Cloning of LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2—The mouse LysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 (mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2) gene was identified based upon sequence homology with the previously reported LPCAT1 (27Nakanishi H.

The putative open reading frame of mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 encoded a 544-amino acid protein of 60.3 kDa, containing three putative transmembrane domains (36Tusnady G.E. Simon I. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 849-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar) and several conserved motifs found in members of the lysophospholipid acyltransferase family (27Nakanishi H. Shindou H.

Coleman R.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 contained putative EF-hand-like motifs (aa 374–494, E-value = 3e*-10) predicted by a conserved domain data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml) (38Marchler-Bauer A.

It exhibited 88.4% amino acid sequence homology to human LysoPAFAT/LP-CAT2 (hLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2) (Fig. 1). The presence of the C-terminal sequence motif KKXX suggests that the protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (39Shikano S. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5783-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Tissue Distribution and Subcellular Localization of mLyso-PAFAT/LPCAT2 mRNA—The tissue distribution of mLyso-PAFAT/LPCAT2 was analyzed by quantitative PCR. We found the highest level of mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 expression in resident macrophages, casein-induced neutrophils, followed by skin, colon, spleen, and thioglycollate-induced macrophages (Fig. 2A). To facilitate immunocytochemical analysis of mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2, we constructed an expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2. It was transfected into CHO-K1, and the enzyme distribution was examined by confocal microscopy after 48 h. FLAG-mLyso-PAFAT/LPCAT2 exhibited significant enzyme activities (Fig. 3, A and B). Cells were stained for ER-Golgi using DiOC6(3). The subcellular distribution pattern of FLAG-mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 was similar to that of DiOC6(3), suggesting that the enzyme is present mainly in the ER and Golgi (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 3Substrate selectivity of mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 and siRNA transfection with hLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 siRNAs. A, lysophospholipid acetyltransferase assays were performed by TLC with 20 μm lysophospholipid (1-acyl- and 1-alkyl-LPA, LPC, lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), or lysophosphatidylserine (LPS)) and 100 μm [3H]acetyl-CoA in the presence of 1 μg of the microsomal fractions from vector-transfected (open bars) or mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2-transfected (closed bars) cells. 1-O-Alkenyl-LPC (heart), LPI (liver), and LPS (brain) were from bovine tissues. Other lysophospholipids contained a palmitoyl group at the sn-1 position. B, several LPC (1-acyl-LPC C16, C18, 1-alkyl-LPC C16, C18, and 1-alkenyl-LPC) acetyltransferase activities were measured. mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 possessed lysophospholipid acetyltransferase activities toward 1-O-alkyl-LPC, 1-acyl-LPC, and 1-O-alkenyl-LPC. ND, not detectable. C, three hLyso-PAFAT/LPCAT2 siRNAs and a control siRNA were transfected into HEK293 cells. After 48 h, mRNA levels (left) and lyso-PAF acetyltransferase activities (right) were measured, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Endogenous lyso-PAF acetyltransferase activity was reduced by each hLy-soPAFAT/LPCAT2 siRNA. The data represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements. Statistical analyses were performed by analysis of variance and Tukey’s multiple comparison test (p < 0.01). Two independent experiments were performed with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Substrate Selectivity of mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2—We next examined the acetyltransferase activity of mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 using a variety of 20 μm lysophospholipid acceptors and 100 μm [3H]acetyl-CoA as a donor. mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 had detectable acetyltransferase activity toward LPC (Fig. 3A) and alkyl-LPC (Fig. 3B). The enzyme had a higher activity toward C16 lysophospholipids than C18 at the sn-1 moiety, which served as an acetyl acceptor (Fig. 3B). The acetyltransferase activity of mLysoPAFAT/LPCAT2 was linear for the first 40 min at 37 °C, and the enzyme exhibited calcium-dependent activity with a pH optimum around 7.4 (data not shown). To confirm whether the product of the acetyltransferase reaction is PAF, we first performed a competitive receptor binding assay using PAFR prepared from PAFR-transgenic mice (7Shindou H. Ishii S. Uozumi N. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34Ishii S. Nagase T. Tashiro F. Ikuta K. Sato S. Waga I."

https://openalex.org/W2066445331,"Systemic inflammation is a leading cause of hospital death. Mild systemic inflammation is accompanied by warmth-seeking behavior (and fever), whereas severe inflammation is associated with cold-seeking behavior (and hypothermia). Both behaviors are adaptive. Which brain structures mediate which behavior is unknown. The involvement of hypothalamic structures, namely, the preoptic area (POA), paraventricular nucleus (PVH), or dorsomedial nucleus (DMH), in thermoregulatory behaviors associated with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS])-induced systemic inflammation was studied in rats. The rats were allowed to select their thermal environment by freely moving in a thermogradient apparatus. A low intravenous dose of Escherichia coli LPS (10 µg/kg) caused warmth-seeking behavior, whereas a high, shock-inducing dose (5,000 µg/kg) caused cold-seeking behavior. Bilateral electrocoagulation of the PVH or DMH, but not of the POA, prevented this cold-seeking response. Lesioning the DMH with ibotenic acid, an excitotoxin that destroys neuronal bodies but spares fibers of passage, also prevented LPS-induced cold-seeking behavior; lesioning the PVH with ibotenate did not affect it. Lesion of no structure affected cold-seeking behavior induced by heat exposure or by pharmacological stimulation of the transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid-1 channel (“warmth receptor”). Nor did any lesion affect warmth-seeking behavior induced by a low dose of LPS, cold exposure, or pharmacological stimulation of the TRP melastatin-8 (“cold receptor”). We conclude that LPS-induced cold-seeking response is mediated by neuronal bodies located in the DMH and neural fibers passing through the PVH. These are the first two landmarks on the map of the circuitry of cold-seeking behavior associated with endotoxin shock."
https://openalex.org/W2132105926,"Enterovirus 71 is an enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. The 2C protein of poliovirus, a relative of enterovirus 71, is essential for viral replication. The poliovirus 2C protein is associated with host membrane vesicles, which form viral replication complexes where viral RNA synthesis takes place. We have now identified a host-encoded 2C binding protein called reticulon 3, which we found to be associated with the replication complex through direct interaction with the enterovirus 71-encoded 2C protein. We observed that the N terminus of the 2C protein, which has both RNA- and membrane-binding activity, interacted with reticulon 3. This region of interaction was mapped to its reticulon homology domain, whereas that of 2C was encoded by the 25th amino acid, isoleucine. Reticulon 3 could also interact with the 2C proteins encoded by other enteroviruses, such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus A16, implying that it is a common factor for such viral replication. Reduced production of reticulon 3 by RNA interference markedly reduced the synthesis of enterovirus 71-encoded viral proteins and replicative double-stranded RNA, reducing plaque formation and apoptosis. Furthermore, reintroduction of nondegradable reticulon 3 into these knockdown cells rescued enterovirus 71 infectivity, and viral protein and double-stranded RNA synthesis. Thus, reticulon 3 is an important component of enterovirus 71 replication, through its potential role in modulation of the sequential interactions between enterovirus 71 viral RNA and the replication complex.

The genome of human enteroviruses is about 7.5 kilobases. It encodes a single polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved to give rise to various structural and nonstructural viral proteins. The human enterovirus family is classified into five species: the poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus A, coxsackievirus B, echovirus, and other enteroviruses (1Racaniello V. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 2001: 685-722Google Scholar). Their genomes are highly homologous and thus share very similar biochemical properties. One of their universal features is that infection with positive-stranded RNA viruses results in a range of membrane morphologies, many of which involve complex membrane rearrangements. Vesicular structures generated in picornavirus-infected cells appear to serve as compartments where synthesis of viral RNA takes place. These structures are derived from membranes of different cellular organelles involved in secretory pathways, primarily endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but also the Golgi complex and possibly others (2Bienz K.

The vesicles are associated with the above viral proteins (2Bienz K. Egger D. Pasamontes L. Virology. 1987; 160: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 9Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with other viral nonstructural polypeptides (42Egger D. Pasamontes L. Bolten R. Boyko V. Bienz K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8675-8683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and exhibit a rosette-like morphology with elongated replication complexes surrounded by round vesicles (9Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are equipped with all the necessary components of the RNA- and translation-synthesizing machinery. It is not clear how the viral RNA is located to these complexes, and the mechanism by which these vesicles are generated is unknown. Furthermore, it has not been determined whether host-encoded proteins play any role in the formation of these replication complex-associated vesicles. The 2C protein is one of the most highly conserved of the viral proteins among all picornaviruses. The PV 2C protein is 37.5 kDa and is composed of 329 amino acids containing a central motif characteristic of nucleoside triphosphate binding proteins (10Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8413-8440Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 11Pfister T. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6992-7001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Sequences present at both the N- and the C-terminal portions of the protein possess nonspecific RNA binding activity in vitro (12Rodriguez P.L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10105-10112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Banerjee R. Dasgupta A. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 2621-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both 2C and its precursor 2BC appear to be associated with viral RNA in infected cells (9Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where the 2C (and 2BC) protein are closely associated with replication complex-associated vesicles (2Bienz K. Egger D. Pasamontes L. Virology. 1987; 160: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 9Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes L. J.

They may be involved in the formation or maintenance of these complexes (9Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the 2C protein, when translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, binds tightly to exogenous microsomal membranes (16Echeverri A.C. Dasgupta A. Virology. 1995; 208: 540-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In these in vitro binding studies, the N-terminal region encompassing amino acids 21-54 was required for membrane binding. This region is associated with a conserved, predicted amphipathic helix between residues 18 and 35 (17Paul A.V. Molla A. Wimmer E. Virology. 1994; 199: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal 2C possesses the ability to bind RNA and cellular membranes. Disruption of this amphipathic region results in defective viral RNA synthesis. However, the precise role of 2C in RNA replication is not defined. We performed a two-hybrid experiment in yeast to search for cellular proteins that interact with the N-terminal region of the 2C protein of EV71, which might modulate virus activity. We report here the identification of reticulon 3 (RTN3), a member of the reticulon family of proteins, as a binding partner of the viral 2C protein of EV71. There are four members of the reticulon family, all of which contain a highly conserved reticulon homology domain (RHD) of about 188 amino acids, with two putative transmembrane regions separated by a 66-residue loop (18Oertle T. Schwab M.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 187-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 19Woolf C.J. Neuron. 2003; 38: 153-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Moreover, the RTN family is involved in membrane trafficking and maintaining ER shaping (20Iwahashi J. Kawasaki I. Kohara Y. Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Ohshima Y. Hamada N. Hara K. Kashiwagi T. Toyoda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell. 2006; 124: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Because of these interactions and expression patterns, their functions have been postulated to include structural stabilization of the ER network, proapoptotic mechanisms, protein secretion, and transport of constituents of the ER to other compartments (18Oertle T. Schwab M.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 187-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, their functions in relation to viral replication, particularly via interaction with the encoded viral proteins of enterovirus 71, remain unknown. Our data indicate that changes in RTN3 expression in cells modulate EV71 viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) synthesis and protein expression markedly. In addition, the 2C proteins of PV and coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) were demonstrated to interact with RTN3. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that the host-encoded RTN3 protein functions as a cellular modifier of enterovirus infection and replication. Cell Culture, Viruses, and Plaque Assay—HeLa, HEK-293T, RD, and Vero cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Puromycin at 0.5 μg/ml was used to select and maintain silencing RNA (siRNA) in HeLa cells. The RTN3-retransformed HeLa cells (2A3) were maintained in puromycin at 0.5 μg/ml and G418 at 1 mg/ml. The EV71 and CA16 were from the Clinical Virology Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and PV vRNA (Type 1, Mahoney) was from Dr. Chun-Nan Lee at the School of Medical Technology, National Taiwan University. EV71 titers in culture medium were determined from monolayers of different HeLa-derived cells using an agar overlay plaque assay using RD cells in triplicate. Briefly, RD cells (4 × 105 cells/well) were plated onto 6-well dishes, incubated overnight, and then infected with serially diluted virus suspension. After adsorption for 1 h, the virus suspension was replaced with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.3% agarose. The medium was removed at 96 h postinfection (p.i.), and the cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and subsequently stained with 1% crystal violet. The titer of the virus was expressed as plaque-forming units/milliliter (24Wong W.R. Chen Y.Y. Yang S.M. Chen Y.L. Horng J.T. Life Sci. 2005; 78: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The plasmids pGBKT7-EV71 2C1 and pGBKT7-EV71 2C2 were constructed as baits for yeast two-hybrid screening, in which the enterovirus 71 2C protein N-terminal amino acids 5-43 and 5-124, respectively, were fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 in the vector pGBKT7. Corresponding cDNA fragments were produced from EV71 cDNA in pCR-XL-TOPO (a gift from Dr. Mei-Shang Ho, Academia Sinica, Taiwan) by PCR amplification using specific primers. The amplified DNA fragments were inserted into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and subsequently subcloned in-frame into NcoI and EcoRI sites of pGBKT7 to produce the plasmids pGBKT7-EV71 2C1 and pGBK7-EV71 2C2 for two-hybrid screening. The full-length clone of human RTN3 (RTN3A1 with 236 amino acids, accession number AF059524) (25Di Scala F. Dupuis L. Gaiddon C. De Tapia M. Jokic N. Gonzalez de Aguilar J.L. Raul J.S. Ludes B. Loeffler J.P. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and its truncated mutants were obtained from a human fetal brain cDNA library by PCR amplification using specific primers and were inserted into pcDNA3.1-Myc-His. The N-terminal 2C proteins (2C1 and 2C2) of enterovirus 71 were cloned into an EcoRI site of pEGFP-C1 to produce the plasmids pEGFP-EV71 2C1 and pEGFP-EV71 2C2. Full-length EV71 2C was amplified from EV71 cDNA in pCR-XL-TOPO and cloned into pEGFP. PV 2C and CA16 2C full-length cDNA fragments were obtained from virus RNA by reverse transcription-PCR amplification and were subsequently cloned into pEGFP-C1 to produce plasmids pEGFP-PV2C and pEGFP-CA2C. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—After verifying that the bait plasmids were expressed in the AH109 yeast strain and did not activate the reporter gene, the AH109 yeast strain was transformed with pGBKT7-EV71 2C1 or 2C2 to screen an oligo(dT)-primed human fetal brain cDNA library fused to the Gal4-activating domain vector (pACT2; Clontech). The positive clones were selected on low stringency plates lacking tryptophan (Trp) and leucine (Leu). After 3-4 days of growth, the Trp+, Leu+ transformants were replica-plated to high stringency plates (lacking tryptophan, leucine, adenine, and histidine) and were incubated until colonies appeared. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against RTN3 were raised against His-tagged fusion proteins of full-length human RTN3, and rat polyclonal antibodies against RTN3 were raised against GST-tagged fusion proteins of full-length human RTN3. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against enterovirus 71 3A and 2C proteins were prepared using His tag fusions to the full-length 3A and 2C1 proteins, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies against His tag and EV71 were from Serotec (Oxford, UK) and Chemicon (Temecula, CA), respectively, and rabbit polyclonal antibody against green fluorescent protein (GFP) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal antibody against c-Myc was clone 9E10. Antiserum to dsRNA was used to characterize the replication complex. Poly(I-C) (Sigma) was used as a source of dsRNA, and the polyclonal antibody was prepared as described (26Francki R.I. Jackson A.O. Virology. 1972; 48: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Schonborn J. Oberstrass J. Breyel E. Tittgen J. Schumacher J. Lukacs N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2993-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, methylated bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem) was mixed with an equal amount of poly(I-C) dissolved in SSC buffer (150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.2), and the resultant insoluble mixture was emulsified with one part of Freund’s adjuvant. The mixture was then injected subcutaneously into Sprague-Dawley rats (BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd.). The animal experiments were conducted in conditions based on the Chang Gung University Guiding Principles on Animal Experiment. The titer and specificities of the antibodies to poly(I-C) and viral dsRNA were characterized by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence microscopy (data not shown; supplemental Fig. 2). Detergent Treatment of Virus-infected P15 Fraction—Vero cells infected with EV71 were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and collected by low speed centrifugation. A cytoplasmic extract was prepared by cell cracker (EMBL) homogenization in PBS containing protease inhibitors and then centrifuged twice at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to sediment unbroken cells, nuclei, and large sheets of plasma membrane. The supernatants were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to separate membrane (P15) and supernatant fractions (S15). The P15 membrane fraction was treated with 0.1 m Na2CO3 or 1% Triton X-100 in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed using 12% SDS-PAGE. Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—HEK-293T cells (5 × 106) were transfected by electroporation at 250 V and 1000 microfarads. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of various plasmids and harvested for further assays at 24 h after transfection. Transfected cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped into lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA) with freshly added protease inhibitors. After incubation for 30 min on ice and a brief sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble cell debris. Equal amounts (500 μg) of lysates were incubated overnight with 1 μg of antibody at 4 °C with continuous rocking. Mouse serum as an irrelevant IgG (0.5 μl) was used as a control. After incubation with protein G beads for 3 h at 4 °C with continuous rocking, beads were washed thoroughly with lysis buffer; the sample buffer was added and further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride paper, and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cell monolayers (1.5 × 105) were plated onto coverslips 1 day before transfection or infection. The cells were transfected with various constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and then washed twice with 25 mm glycine in PBS and once with PBS. To detect the presence of dsRNA, the infected cells were first fixed in cold acetone at 8 h p.i. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the cells with a blocking solution (1% gelatin, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% saponin in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed by incubating the cells with primary antibodies in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Washes were followed by incubation with secondary antibodies diluted with blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescence was then evaluated using a Leica laser confocal microscope (model SP2). Reticulon 3 Knockdown and Retransformation—The siRNA precursor of RTN3 in vector pSUPER.retro (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA) and the vector control were transfected stably into HeLa cells. Transduced subpopulations were selected using 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. The knockdown siRNA sequence is listed below with its target 19-bp stem loop sequence underlined. The sense strand was 5′-GAT CCC CGC TGT ACA GAA GTC AGA AGT TCA AGA GAC TTC TGA CTT CTG TAC AGC TTT TTA-3′, and the antisense strand was 5′-AGC TTA AAA AGC TGT ACA GAA GTC AGA AGT CTC TTG AAC TTC TGA CTT CTG TAC AGC GGG-3′. For the reintroduction of nondegradable RTN3 into siRTN3 cells, two nucleotide mutations, G126A and G129A, were introduced in the region of RTN3 (accession number AF059524) that was complementary to the siRNA, using site-directed mutagenesis. The RTN3 mutagenic primers were as follows. The N-terminal forward primer was 5′-ATG GCG GAG CCG TCG GCG GCC ACT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GCG GTG CAC GAT CTG ATT TTC-3′. The C-terminal forward primer was 5′-GAA AAT CAG ATC GTG CAC CGC ACA GGA GGA ACT ACA GCT CTT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-TTC TGC CTT TTT TTT GGC GAT TCC-3′ (substituted nucleotides are underlined). Both the N- and the C-terminal fragments of RTN3 were amplified and annealed for extension by PCR using pfu polymerase. The products were cloned into pcDNA3.1-Myc-His, and the resulting plasmid was transfected into the siRTN3 cell line to generate a rescue cell line termed 2A3 under selection of 0.5 μg/ml puromycin and 1 mg/ml G418. GST Pulldown Assay—EV71 2C1 was cloned into the pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length human RTN3 was cloned into the hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein vector (pET32; Novagen, Madison, WI). Fusion proteins were prepared and further purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions. GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with His-tagged RTN3 in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with TBS buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with glutathione elution buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the N-terminal amphipathic domain of EV71 2C was designed according to Paul et al. (17Paul A.V. Molla A. Wimmer E. Virology. 1994; 199: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Synthetic forward primers containing the site-specific substitution in the N-terminal 2C1 coding sequence were used to generate three separate mutants: pEV2C1 D10VE19V-GFP, 5′-TTA AAG AAG TTC AAC GTT GCG GCG AAT GCC GCG AAG GGG CTT GTG TGG-3′; pEV2C1 K16TK24T-GFP, 5′-TTA AAG AAG TTC AAC GAT GCG GCG AAT GCC GCG ACG GGG CTT GAG TGG ATC TCC AAC ACA ATC-3′; pEV2C1 I125K-GFP, 5′-TTA AAG AAG TTC AAC GAT GCG GCG AAT GCC GCG AAG GGG CTT GAG TGG ATC TCC AAC AAA AAA AGT-3′. The amino acid changes have been underlined; these fragments were annealed and cloned into pcDNA3.1-Myc-His. Quantitative RT-PCR—Vector control and siRTN3 cells were infected with EV71 at an MOI of 5, and total RNA was extracted from cells at the indicated times using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The first strand of cDNA was synthesized using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 50 nm forward and reverse primers, 1× SYBR green master mix (Protech Technology Enterprise), and various amounts of template. Fluorescence emitted by SYBR green was detected on line by the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). To quantify the changes in gene expression, the ΔCt method was used to calculate relative -fold changes normalized against the 18 S gene, as described in Ref. 44Biosystems Applied User Bulletin No. 2 for ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System. 2001; (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)Google Scholar. The Ct is defined as the cycle at which fluorescence is determined to be significantly greater than background. The ratio of vRNA to internal control was normalized to the control level at 0 h p.i., arbitrarily set to 1. Cell Death Analysis—For EV71-induced cell death analysis, mock- and virus-infected cells at an MOI of 0.5 were stained with propidium iodide (Sigma) at 60 h p.i. and measured by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Biosciences). CellQuest Pro version 4.0 was used for data analysis. The EV71 2C Protein Is Associated with Host Membranes and the Replication Complex—EV71 2C is one of the most highly conserved proteins among all picornaviruses (28Argos P. Kamer G. Nicklin M.J. Wimmer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7251-7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 29Franssen H. Leunissen J. Goldbach R. Lomonossoff G. Zimmern D. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 855-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It shares 65% identity with that of the closely related PV, which binds to and rearranges mammalian membranes to form the replication complex. To investigate whether this association with mammalian membranes is also seen with the EV71 2C protein, we applied solubilization studies using buffers that allowed discrimination between peripheral and integral membrane proteins. Vero cells infected with EV71 were fractionated differentially and analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-2C antibody (Fig. 1A). Less protein was found in the PBS-soluble cytosol fraction (S15 fraction) than in the pellet fraction (P15). P15 was treated with various conditions, including detergent (1% Triton X-100) or high pH. Under alkaline conditions (0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5), most of 2C was insoluble. However, protein 2C was completely soluble in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. From this solubility pattern and following the definition of Fujiki et al. (30Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar), we conclude that the EV71 2C protein is indeed membrane-associated, as has previously been observed for the 2C protein of PV. A universal feature of positive-stranded RNA viruses is the involvement of host intracellular membranes in RNA replication complex formation and function. Thus, it would be interesting to determine whether this membranous structure associated with EV71 2C is actually the viral RNA replication complex. Previous studies have demonstrated amply that the replication complex contains replicative viral dsRNA and markers of the ER. Here we used confocal microscopy to localize the replication complex using anti-dsRNA antibodies. To localize the ER, we transfected a plasmid expressing a fluorescent protein targeted to its lumen (ER-DsRed). HeLa cells were transfected with ER-DsRed followed by infection with EV71 and processed for confocal microscopy at 8 h p.i. As demonstrated in Fig. 1B (panel a), the 2C protein of EV71 colocalizes with the marker for endoplasmic reticulum. Next, we tested whether the N-terminal amino acid (aa) sequence (aa 5-43) of 2C, which has a potential membrane binding activity similar to that of PV 2C, colocalized with the ER. Therefore, we cotransfected plasmids containing 2C1 (aa 5-43 of 2C) and ER-DsRed into HeLa cells. The subcellular distribution of 2C1 was similar to the native 2C protein in that it appeared filamentous and perinuclear and colocalized with the marker for ER (Fig. 1B, panel c). Subsequently, we performed double labeling of HeLa cells with anti-dsRNA and 2C antibodies after EV71 infection. Fig. 1B (panel b) demonstrates the colocalization of fluorescent foci for dsRNA and the 2C protein of EV71. From this membrane association and morphological data, the function of the EV71 2C protein appears to be similar to its PV counterpart in that it is associated with membranous structures and may be involved in the formation or maintenance of the vesicle-associated replication complex (9Bienz K. Egger D. Troxler M. Pasamontes L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of Reticulon 3 as a Binding Partner for the EV71 Protein 2C by Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—To clarify the viral replication of EV71, we searched for potential partners interacting with 2C using the yeast two-hybrid approach. As a bait, we used a vector containing the N-terminal domain of 2C (aa 5-124, designated 2C2) to screen a human fetal brain cDNA library. We analyzed 1.3 × 107 library clones; 28 positive colonies were identified, based on their ability to activate all of the reporters present in yeast. One colony was identified as reticulon 3, and one was identified as reticulon 1C. In another yeast two-hybrid screening experiment, we used 2C1 (aa 5-43) as the bait. Ten of 14 2C1-positive clones were identified as RTN1C. This increased our confidence that there must be interaction between 2C and members of the RTN family. Furthermore, both RTN1C and RTN3 share 60% identity at the protein level in their RHDs. Therefore, the predicted membrane/RNA binding domain of 2C is also involved in RTN binding. Both of the RTN clones identified by our yeast two-hybrid screening contain only the RHD, so this is likely to be involved in the interaction between 2C and the RTN proteins. Interestingly, in RT-PCR experiments, RTN1C was present in neuronal cells, such as PC12 and IMR32, but was absent in nonneuronal cells, such as Vero, COS1, HEK-293T, and HeLa (data not shown); this is in accordance with previous findings (18Oertle T. Schwab M.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 187-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Alternatively, all of these cell lines were positive for RTN3 (data not shown).

Carotid bodies serve an essential role in this respect; their type I cells depolarize when O2 levels fall, causing voltage-gated Ca2+ entry. Subsequent neurosecretion elicits increased afferent chemosensory fiber discharge to induce appropriate changes in respiratory function (1Gonzalez C. Almaraz L. Obeso A. Rigual R. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 829-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Although depolarization of type I cells by hypoxia is known to arise from K+ channel inhibition, the identity of the signaling pathway has been contested, and the coupling mechanism is unknown (2Prabhakar N.R. Exp. Physiol. 2006; 91: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the effector of hypoxic chemotransduction. AMPK is co-localized at the plasma membrane of type I cells with O2-sensitive K+ channels. In isolated type I cells, activation of AMPK using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) inhibited O2-sensitive K+ currents (carried by large conductance Ca2+-activated (BKCa) channels and TASK (tandem pore, acid-sensing potassium channel)-like channels, leading to plasma membrane depolarization, Ca2+ influx, and increased chemosensory fiber discharge. Conversely, the AMPK antagonist compound C reversed the effects of hypoxia and AICAR on type I cell and carotid body activation. These results suggest that AMPK activation is both sufficient and necessary for the effects of hypoxia. Furthermore, AMPK activation inhibited currents carried by recombinant BKCa channels, whereas purified AMPK phosphorylated theα subunit of the channel in immunoprecipitates, an effect that was stimulated by AMP and inhibited by compound C. Our findings demonstrate a central role for AMPK in stimulus-response coupling by hypoxia and identify for the first time a link between metabolic stress and ion channel regulation in an O2-sensing system.

In isolated type I cells, activation of AMPK using 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) inhibited O2-sensitive K+ currents (carried by large conductance Ca2+-activated (BKCa) channels and TASK (tandem pore, acid-sensing potassium channel)-like channels, leading to plasma membrane depolarization, Ca2+ influx, and increased chemosensory fiber discharge. Conversely, the AMPK antagonist compound C reversed the effects of hypoxia and AICAR on type I cell and carotid body activation. These results suggest that AMPK activation is both sufficient and necessary for the effects of hypoxia. Furthermore, AMPK activation inhibited currents carried by recombinant BKCa channels, whereas purified AMPK phosphorylated theα subunit of the channel in immunoprecipitates, an effect that was stimulated by AMP and inhibited by compound C. Our findings demonstrate a central role for AMPK in stimulus-response coupling by hypoxia and identify for the first time a link between metabolic stress and ion channel regulation in an O2-sensing system. Chronic and intermittent deficits in O2 supply to the body precipitate a variety of pathologies including dementia (3Desmond D.W. Moroney J.T. Sano M. Stern Y. Stroke. 2002; 33: 2254-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and pulmonary hypertension (4Voelkel N.F. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 133: 1186-1195PubMed Google Scholar). To develop effective therapies, it is necessary to understand the homeostatic mechanisms that monitor O2 supply to the body and elicit corrective changes in respiratory and circulatory function to maintain O2 levels. O2-sensitive ion channels, which were first identified in the carotid body type I cell, play a pivotal role in this respect and have now been reported in a diverse range of highly specialized O2-sensing tissues (5Lopez-Barneo J. del Toro R. Levitsky K.L. Chiara M.D. Ortega-Saenz P. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; 96 (discussion 1170-1182): 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Within the carotid body, clusters of type I cells lie in presynaptic contact with afferent sensory fibers, whose discharge increases in proportion to the degree of systemic arterial O2 deficit, providing information concerning blood O2 levels to the central respiratory centers (1Gonzalez C. Almaraz L. Obeso A. Rigual R. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 829-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 2Prabhakar N.R. Exp. Physiol. 2006; 91: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This occurs subsequent to hypoxic inhibition of type I cell K+ channels, membrane depolarization, voltage-gated Ca2+ influx (6Weir E.K. Lopez-Barneo J. Buckler K.J. Archer S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 2042-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), and consequent neurotransmitter release. For many years, there has existed compelling evidence that mitochondria serve an important role in O2 sensing by type I cells (2Prabhakar N.R. Exp. Physiol. 2006; 91: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7Mills E. Jobsis F.F. J. Neurophysiol. 1972; 35: 405-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Indeed, mitochondrial inhibitors can both mimic the cellular effects of hypoxia and occlude type I cell O2 sensitivity (8Mulligan E. Lahiri S. Storey B.T. J. Appl. Physiol. 1981; 51: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Wyatt C.N. Buckler K.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 556: 175-191Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These effects, and the downstream cellular responses, are manifest at relatively high tissue O2 levels, which would not be limiting in other, non-specialized cells (10Duchen M.R. Biscoe T.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 450: 13-31Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, type I cell metabolism may be the key to the mechanism by which hypoxia is coupled to neurosecretion. We therefore investigated the potential role in this process of AMPK, 6The abbreviations used are: AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; TASK, tandem pore, acid-sensing potassium channel; BKCa, large conductance voltage and Ca2+-activated potassium channel; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside; pO2, partial pressure of oxygen; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 6The abbreviations used are: AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; TASK, tandem pore, acid-sensing potassium channel; BKCa, large conductance voltage and Ca2+-activated potassium channel; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside; pO2, partial pressure of oxygen; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a key sensor of metabolic stress that is universally expressed in eukaryotes. When cells are exposed to metabolic stresses, a rise in the cellular ADP/ATP ratio is partly compensated by the adenylate kinase reaction, which precipitates a much larger increase in the AMP/ATP ratio, although the fall in ATP may be negligible (11Wyatt C.N. Kumar P. Aley P. Peers C. Hardie D.G. Evans A.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 580 (discussion 351-199): 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 12Hardie D.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). AMPK is activated via multiple mechanisms that make the system acutely sensitive to relatively small changes in the AMP/ATP ratio (13Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Hawley S.A. Davies S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Although it was originally proposed to regulate energy balance within single cells (14Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), it has recently become clear that AMPK also performs this function at the level of the whole animal, through its regulation of hypothalamic neurones that drive food intake and by its ability to stimulate energy expenditure in peripheral tissues (15Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that AMPK also underpins the response of other physiological systems to stimuli that affect metabolism, e.g. excitation of the carotid body by hypoxia (16Evans A.M. Mustard K.J. Wyatt C.N. Peers C. Dipp M. Kumar P. Kinnear N.P. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41504-41511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), has therefore become attractive. This is particularly so given that our previous study established that physiologically relevant levels of hypoxia increased the AMP/ATP ratio in O2-sensing cells, leading to concomitant activation of AMPK activity that was primarily associated with heterotrimers containing the AMPKα1 catalytic subunit isoform (16Evans A.M. Mustard K.J. Wyatt C.N. Peers C. Dipp M. Kumar P. Kinnear N.P. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41504-41511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this study suggested that activation of AMPK by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) induces transmembrane calcium influx into carotid body type I cells and thereby increases afferent fiber discharge from the isolated carotid body (16Evans A.M. Mustard K.J. Wyatt C.N. Peers C. Dipp M. Kumar P. Kinnear N.P. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41504-41511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, we have yet to determine whether this is achieved by the same mechanisms that are engaged by hypoxia. Here we demonstrate that AMPK elicits carotid body activation by mimicking precisely the effects of hypoxia on carotid body type I cells and that inhibition of AMPK reverses these effects. All experiments were performed under the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Carotid Body Type I Cell Isolation—Neonatal rats (10–21 days) were killed, and carotid bodies were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold, oxygenated phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (Sigma). These were then enzymically dissociated and cultured as described previously (9Wyatt C.N. Buckler K.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 556: 175-191Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). HEK 293 Cell Culture—HEK 293 cells that express human brain αβ-BKCa channels (17Ahring P.K. Strobaek D. Christophersen P. Olesen S.P. Johansen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously (18Lewis A. Peers C. Ashford M.L. Kemp P.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 540: 771-780Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The co-expressed α and β subunits were KCNMA1 (GenBank™ accession number U11717) and KCNMB1 (GenBank accession number U42600), respectively. Immunocytochemistry—Type I cells were fixed, immunostained, and visualized as described previously (16Evans A.M. Mustard K.J. Wyatt C.N. Peers C. Dipp M. Kumar P. Kinnear N.P. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41504-41511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies were selective for the AMPKα1 subunit (1:500, sheep polyclonal, D. G. Hardie, Dundee, Scotland, raised against peptide residues 344–358 of rat AMPKα1) and the BKCaα subunit (1:100, mouse monoclonal, BD Transduction Laboratories, raised against peptide residues 995–1113 of human brain BKCaα). Images were deconvolved and analyzed off-line via Softworx (Applied Precision) and Volocity (Improvision). Carotid Body Electrophysiology—Recordings were made using the amphotericin perforated-patch configuration of the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) controlled by Clampex 6.0 or Fetchex 6.0 software (Axon Instruments). Currents were digitized at 6.6 kHz and filtered at 1–2 kHz, and membrane potential recordings were digitized at 0.1 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Experiments were performed at 35–36 °C. Cells were bathed in solution A of composition (in mm): 4.5 KCl; 140 NaCl; 2.5 CaCl2; 1 MgCl2; 11 glucose; 20 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4. Pipette solution was (in mm): 55 K2SO4; 30 KCl; 5 MgCl2; 1 EGTA; 10 glucose; 20 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.2. Pipette solution contained amphotericin B (240 μg ml-1, Sigma). Liquid junction potential was ∼6 mV. Results were not leak-subtracted, seal resistance was typically >5 gigaohms, access resistance was typically 15–20 megaohms and was not compensated for, and holding currents were typically less than 5 pA. All data were analyzed using Clampfit and Fetchan programs (pClamp6, Axon Instruments). HEK 293 Cell Electrophysiology—Recordings were made using the conventional whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Data were acquired using a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Axon Instruments) controlled by Clampex 9.0 software (Axon Instruments). Data were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. All experiments were performed at 22 °C. Cells were bathed in a solution of composition (in mm): 5 KCl; 150 NaCl; 2 CaCl2; 2 MgCl2; 10 glucose; 10 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4. Pipette solution was (in mm): 140 KSCN; 5 EGTA; 1 MgCl2; 0.5 CaCl2; 10 HEPES; 3 MgATP; 0.3 NaGTP, adjusted to pH 7.25. Liquid junction potential was ∼6.5 mV. Results were leak-subtracted, seal resistance was typically >7 gigaohms, access resistance was typically 8–12 megaohms and series resistance was compensated by 60–80%, and holding currents were 20–50 pA. All data were analyzed using Clampfit 9 (Axon Instruments). Ca2+ Imaging—Cells were incubated for 30 min (22–24 °C, dark) in a Ca2+-free solution (in mm): 4.5 KCl; 140 NaCl; 1 MgCl2; 11 glucose; 1 EGTA; 20 HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4, containing 5 μm FURA-2AM (Molecular Probes), and then allowed to equilibrate for 20 min in solution A (35–36 °C). Hypoxic solutions were generated by gassing solution A with 100% N2, pO2 was monitored using an ISO2 oxygen meter (World Precision Instruments, Stevenage, UK). Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using alternate excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm (F340 and F380, 20-ms exposure). Emitted fluorescence was recorded as described previously (16Evans A.M. Mustard K.J. Wyatt C.N. Peers C. Dipp M. Kumar P. Kinnear N.P. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41504-41511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) at 0.05 Hz with background subtraction carried out online. Isolated Carotid Body—Rats were anesthetized with 1–4% halothane in O2, and carotid bodies with attached carotid sinus nerve were excised as described previously (19Pepper D.R. Landauer R.C. Kumar P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 485: 531-541Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Extracellular recordings of single or few-fiber afferent fiber action potentials were recorded on videotape and sampled digitally via Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK) for analysis of discharge frequency. Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 1000 × g, after which the pellet was homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin). This was followed by centrifugation (1000 × g,5 min, 4 °C). The pellet was then solubilized in 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer B (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 1.5% v/v Triton X-100, with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 50 μg/ml aprotinin). Antibodies (either anti-BKCaα subunits (5 μg) or anti-AMPKα1 subunits (6 μg), as used for immunocytochemistry) were added to solubilized suspensions and incubated overnight at 4 °C before the addition of 50 μl of protein G beads. Following further incubation (>4 h, 4 °C, with rotation), the beads were pelleted at 7000 × g (5 min) and washed three times in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer C (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 50 μg/ml aprotinin). Pelleted immunoprecipitates were taken up into 50 μl of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% v/v glycerol, 0.2% w/v SDS 5% v/v β-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue), heated for 3 min at 100 °C, and loaded onto 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and separated at 100 V for 1 h. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 250 mA for 1 h, and membranes were blocked overnight with 10% (w/v) nonfat powdered milk in PBS at 4 °C. After washing membranes three times in PBS/0.05% Tween 20, they were incubated with anti-AMPKα1 antibody (1:500) or anti-BKCaα antibody (1:250) in PBS/0.5% nonfat powdered milk for 1 h at 21 °C. Membranes were then washed extensively with PBS before incubation with anti-mouse or anti-sheep peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:10,000 in PBS, Pierce) for 1 h. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK). Molecular masses were estimated using calibrated prestained standards (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Purification of BKCaα Subunit from HEK293 Cells—BKCaα was immunoprecipitated from HEK-293 cells stably expressing the channel (20Hartness M.E. Brazier S.P. Peers C. Bateson A.N. Ashford M.L. Kemp P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51422-51432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Culture dishes (4 × 15 cm) of cells were grown to 90% confluency. Cells were washed once in 10 ml of ice-cold PBS and then lysed in situ by the addition of 2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 4 °C, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2% Triton X-100, 0.25 m mannitol). Lysate was then precleared by incubating on a roller mixer with 2 ml of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, 50% slurry in lysis buffer) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation (230 × g, 5 min). BKCaα was subsequently immunoprecipitated from the supernatant using 20 μg of anti-BKCaα antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) prebound to 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose. After 2 h at 4 °C, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (230 × g, 5 min). The immunoprecipitate was washed five times in lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl followed by five times washing in lysis buffer without NaCl. Phosphorylation of BKCaα Subunit Using Purified Rat Liver AMPK—Immunopurified BKCa was washed six times in assay buffer (50 mm sodium-Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% (w/v) Brij-35) containing 1 m NaCl followed by eight washes in assay buffer without NaCl. The immune complexes were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 4.5 μg/ml recombinant PP1γ in assay buffer. They were washed five times in assay buffer containing 1 m NaCl followed by five further washes in assay buffer. They were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 5 mm MgCl2 and 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (300 cpm/pmol) in 50 mm sodium-Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% (w/v) Brij-35, with or without purified rat liver AMPK (Hawley et al. (34Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar)) and with or without AMP (200 μm) or compound C (100 μm). The reactions were stopped by the addition of lithium dodecyl sulphate loading dye and reducing agent (Invitrogen). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using the 3–8% gradient Tris acetate system (Invitrogen) and gels stained with Colloidal Blue staining kits (Invitrogen). Destained gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The BKCaα band was excised, and the incorporation of [32P]phosphate was determined by Cerenkov counting. The amount of BKCaα subunit was estimated by running known amounts of bovine serum albumin on the same gel, comparing intensities of Coomassie Blue-stained bands by densitometry and assuming that the same amount of dye bound per μg of protein. Identification of the BKCaα Subunit by Mass Spectrometry—A gel slice was excised and washed successively for 15 min in water, CH3CN + 100 mm NH4HCO3 (50:50 v/v), and finally in 20 mm NH4HCO3/CH3CN (50:50 v/v). The gel slice was dehydrated in water + CH3CN (50:50 v/v) for 5 min. The supernatant was dried in a SpeedVac concentrator and resuspended in 20 μl of 12.5 μg/ml trypsin (Roche Applied Science, modified sequencing grade) in 20 mm NH4HCO3/0.1% n-octylglucoside. Digestion occurred overnight at 30 °C on a shaking platform. An equal volume of CH3CN was then added to the digest and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C on a shaking platform. An aliquot (10%) of the peptide digest was then analyzed by tandem matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer). The mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry data generated were used to search the Celera Discovery System human data base (Applied Biosystems) using the Mascot search algorithm (35Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6661) Google Scholar). This confirmed the identity of the 125-kDa band as the BKCaα subunit (SwissProt accession number KCNMA1). Statistics—All data are presented as means ± S.E. of the mean. Statistical significance was assessed using two-tailed Bonferroni-Dunn post hoc test (in vitro carotid body) or Student’s paired or unpaired t test (all other data) as appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Consistent with the hypothesis that AMPK serves a key role in O2 sensing by the carotid body, we found that in isolated carotid body type I cells, the AMPKα1 catalytic subunit isoform and O2-sensitive BKCa channels co-localize at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A, panels i–iv). Thus, 75.1 ± 4.4% of the total AMPKα1 staining was located within 1 μm of the type I cell plasma membrane (n = 14), where it co-localized with O2-sensitive BKCa channels (21Peers C. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 119: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), with 71.0 ± 2.6% of staining for the pore-forming BKCaα subunit coinciding with that for the AMPKα1 catalytic subunit isoform (Pearson’s correlation 0.65 ± 0.05, n = 5; Fig. 1, A, panels iii and iv). Furthermore, BKCa channel currents were selectively inhibited in acutely isolated type I cells by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR), a nucleoside that is taken up by cells and metabolized to the AMP mimetic, ZMP, thus activating AMPK in the absence of ATP depletion (22Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Analysis of current-voltage relationships for macroscopic K+ currents showed that AICAR (1 mm, 10 min) reversibly inhibited voltage-sensitive K+ currents throughout their activation range, e.g. by 40.0 ± 12.2% during a voltage step from -80 to +30 mV (Fig. 1B; n = 5, p = 0.041). Selective blockade of BKCa channels by iberiotoxin (100 nm) inhibited type I cell macroscopic K+ currents by 60.3 ± 6.8% at +30 mV (n = 7, p = 0.0069) and, in the presence of the toxin, AICAR had no further inhibitory effect on residual voltage-gated K+ currents (Fig. 1C; n = 3). Rat carotid body type I cells also express O2-sensitive, voltage-independent leak K+ channels (23Buckler K.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 498: 649-662Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar) in addition to BKCa channels, although the molecular identity of these TASK-like channels is not known. AICAR also inhibited this Ba2+-sensitive, voltage-independent leak conductance (measured during voltage ramps from -100 mV to -40 mV) by 33.0 ± 2.3%, from 258 ± 24 pS to 171 ± 11 pS (Fig. 1D; n = 4, p = 0.008). Furthermore, in the continued presence of Ba2+, AICAR did not significantly inhibit the residual currents (Fig. 1E; n = 5). These data indicate that AMPK activation, like hypoxia (21Peers C. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 119: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 23Buckler K.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 498: 649-662Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar), selectively inhibits both the O2-sensing BKCa currents and TASK-like leak K+ currents in rat carotid body type I cells, without affecting O2-insensitive delayed rectifier K+ currents. Inhibition of the O2-sensing K+ currents led to reversible depolarization of type I cells by 12.6 ± 0.9 mV (Fig. 2A; n = 6, p = 0.0055) within 12.6 ± 1.9 min of application of AICAR (n = 6). The magnitude of depolarization was equivalent to that seen in response to hypoxia (24Wyatt C.N. Peers C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 483: 559-565Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As expected, AMPK activation triggered voltage-gated Ca2+ influx into carotid body type I cells as monitored by the Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2 (Fig. 2B). Thus, AICAR reversibly increased the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio (F340/F380) from 0.62 ± 0.01 to a peak of 1.71 ± 0.23 (n = 7, p = 0.0028), and this was reversibly inhibited by 84.0 ± 9.3% by Ni2+ (5 mm, n = 7, p = 0.0037), an inhibitor of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Likewise, hypoxia (14–21 mm Hg) increased the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio from 0.67 ± 0.02 to 2.5 ± 0.17 (n = 5). Most significantly, the AMPK antagonist compound C (25Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar) (40 μm) reversibly inhibited the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in response to hypoxia by 65.1 ± 9.8% (Fig. 2C; n = 5, p = 0.00097) and to AICAR by 70.7 ± 4.2% (Fig. 2D; n = 7, p = 0.0004). In marked contrast, compound C (40 μm) had little effect on voltage-gated Ca2+ influx in response to type I cell depolarization by K+ (50 mm), the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio increasing from 0.59 ± 0.008 to 2.87 ± 0.23 in its absence and from 0.58 ± 0.01 to 2.22 ± 0.20 in its presence (Fig. 2E, n = 5). Thus, compound C blocked carotid body type I cell excitation in response to hypoxia without affecting basal levels of intracellular Ca2+ concentration, but it did not block membrane depolarization in response to interventions that reduce the outward K+ conductance, nor did it block voltage-gated Ca2+ entry per se. Recordings from type I cells are not necessarily a reliable indicator of a functional response at the level of the intact carotid body (26Donnelly D.F. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Donnelly D.F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the role of AMPK in mediating afferent chemosensory fiber discharge from the carotid body in vitro. Consistent with our findings on isolated carotid body type I cells, 1 mm AICAR caused a 7-fold increase in spontaneous, single afferent fiber discharge frequency (Fig. 3A). AICAR at 100 or 300 μm was without effect upon basal discharge. The excitatory effect of AICAR at 1 mm was significantly inhibited by around 50% after preincubation with compound C (40 μm) for 10–20 min (Fig. 3A). After 30–40 min of preincubation with compound C, basal discharge was reduced to essentially zero, and the response to AICAR was abolished. Basal carotid body single or few fiber chemoafferent discharge varied slightly between preparations, reflecting individual fiber excitability, but in all cases, discharge increased in response to hypoxia (Fig. 3B). Hypoxia-augmented afferent chemosensory fiber discharge frequency was also inhibited by preincubation with compound C. At 10–20 min, the degree of inhibition was around 50% (Fig. 3C). Despite a reduction in basal discharge following sustained incubation with compound C, a hypoxic response was retained, albeit reduced by about 90% at 70 min. That this was not simply due to “run down” of the preparation was confirmed by control studies, which showed that the hypoxia response was largely retained for up to 120 min following repeated stimulation trials. The mean data are shown in Fig. 3D. Thus, AMPK activation mediates a large component of carotid body type I cell activation by hypoxia, and this is sufficient to trigger an increase in afferent chemosensory fiber discharge that can be substantially blocked by compound C. We next sought to determine whether inhibition by AMPK of O2-sensing K+ currents was mediated by direct phosphorylation of channel proteins, by examining the regulation of human BKCa channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells (17Ahring P.K. Strobaek D. Christophersen P. Olesen S.P. Johansen T.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Analysis of voltage ramps between -100 mV and +100 mV showed that, as in carotid body type I cells, AMPK activation by AICAR (1 mm, 10 min) inhibited BKCa channel currents throughout their current-voltage range; e.g. by 74.4% at +30 mV, from 46.1 ± 8.7 pA pF-1 to 11.8 ± 1.9 pA pF-1 (n = 20, p = 0.00057). Inhibition of BKCa channel currents by AICAR was also reversed to 85.5% of control, i.e. to 39.4 ± 4.4 pA pF-1, by compound C (Fig. 4A; n = 20). Unlike in type I cells, there was no specific co-localization of the α1 subunit of AMPK with the BKCaα subunit at the plasma membrane (not shown), and the two proteins also failed to co-immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4B). Thus, AMPK-dependent regulation of BKCa channels can occur without coupling of these proteins at the molecular level and without precise targeting of AMPK to the plasma membrane protein. It seems likely, therefore, that channel regulation may result from phosphorylation of the BKCa channel protein by AMPK in a manner that may be further facilitated by targeting of AMPK to the plasma membrane in carotid body type I cells. Consistent with this view, when immunoprecipitates made using anti-BKCaα antibodies from HEK293 cells were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and AMPK purified from rat liver (a mixture of the α1β1γ1 and α2β1γ1 heterotrimers), we obtained phosphorylation of the pore-forming BKCaα subunit in the presence of AMPK (Fig. 4C). This phosphorylation was stimulated by AMP and inhibited by compound C (Fig. 4D). The identity of this phosphorylated band as BKCaα was confirmed by mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides. Estimates of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation showed that this was substantial, reaching 0.7–0.9 mole/mole of α subunit within 30 min using 5 units/ml AMPK. In the present investigation, we have addressed the molecular mechanism by which AMPK effects carotid body excitation by hypoxia. In doing so, we have shown that AMPK activation by AICAR precisely mimics the effects of hypoxia on the two key O2-sensitive K+ channels in rat type I cells, i.e. BKCa channels and TASK-like channels. Moreover, we show that activation by hypoxia and AICAR of carotid body type I cells and of the carotid body itself is inhibited, if not abolished, by the AMPK inhibitor, compound C. AICAR is not known to activate any protein kinases other than AMPK, so the finding that compound C reverses carotid body type I cell activation induced by AICAR, but not that induced by depolarization, provides strong support for the view that its effects are mediated by inhibition of the AMPK pathway. Although AICAR does not directly bind to adenosine receptors, it is known to compete with adenosine for the adenosine nucleoside transporter (28Gadalla A.E. Pearson T. Currie A.J. Dale N. Hawley S.A. Sheehan M. Hirst W. Michel A.D. Randall A. Hardie D.G. Frenguelli B.G. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and could therefore increase the extracellular adenosine concentration by competing with released adenosine for uptake into cells. As carotid body afferent discharge is increased by adenosine in a concentration-dependent manner (29McQueen D.S. Ribeiro J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1981; 74: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 30Vandier C. Conway A.F. Landauer R.C. Kumar P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 419-429Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), there was a possibility that the effect of AICAR could have been mediated through this mechanism. However, this would only be apparent in the whole carotid body preparation where adenosine might build up in the synaptic cleft and would not occur in isolated, superfused carotid body type I cells. In a separate series of experiments, we showed that the non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-P-(sulfophenyl)-theophylline (300 μm), when applied prior to AICAR, reduced the afferent chemosensory response to AICAR in carotid body preparations by 53 ± 12%. 7S. A. Pearson and P. Kumar, unpublished data. Given that the AMPK antagonist, compound C, significantly inhibited AICAR-induced increases in afferent fiber discharge and that hypoxia elicits carotid body activation by releasing a variety of neurotransmitters including adenosine (31Conde S.V. Monteiro E.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2006; 580 (discussion 351-179): 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), our findings are consistent with the view that a substantial proportion of the response to AICAR in the whole organ was mediated via AMPK activation, and only a small proportion can be attributed to inhibition of adenosine uptake. Thus, our results suggest that activation of AMPK is necessary as well as sufficient for carotid body activation by hypoxia. We also provide a plausible mechanism for the inhibitory effects on the BKCa channels by showing that AMPK directly phosphorylates the pore-forming α subunit in immunoprecipitates. As expected for an effect of AMPK, phosphorylation was stimulated by AMP and inhibited by compound C, and the stoichiometry approached 1 mole of phosphate/mole of α subunit, showing that the extent of phosphorylation was significant. We propose, therefore, that the AMPK system acts as the primary metabolic sensor as well as the effector of Ca2+ signaling in response to hypoxia in carotid body type I cells. This mechanism can unite the previous mitochondrial and membrane hypotheses for chemotransduction by hypoxia (2Prabhakar N.R. Exp. Physiol. 2006; 91: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recently, O2 sensing by BKCa channels has been proposed to arise via O2-dependent CO production from the closely associated enzyme, heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2 (32Williams S.E. Wootton P. Mason H.S. Bould J. Iles D.E. Riccardi D. Peers C. Kemp P.J. Science. 2004; 306: 2093-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar)). Clearly, when this enzyme is active (i.e. in the presence of its substrates, including O2), channel activity is markedly enhanced due to CO production by HO-2. However, the requirement of this mechanism of channel regulation for O2 sensing in the intact carotid body has not been evaluated. Furthermore, the importance of HO-2 in O2 sensing has more recently been questioned since BKCa channels have been shown to be suppressed by hypoxia in excised membrane patches (33McCartney C.E. McClafferty H. Huibant J.M. Rowan E.G. Shipston M.J. Rowe I.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17870-17876Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that there exist multiple means by which hypoxia might inhibit BKCa channels. However, unlike our proposed mechanism, other mechanisms cannot account for findings that inhibitors of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation prevent carotid body activation by hypoxia (8Mulligan E. Lahiri S. Storey B.T. J. Appl. Physiol. 1981; 51: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Wyatt C.N. Buckler K.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 556: 175-191Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no other mechanism has been so comprehensively tested with respect to its involvement in O2 sensing at the level of ion channel activity, membrane potential, [Ca2+]i regulation, and afferent nerve discharge. On the basis of our present data, therefore, we propose that AMPK is the physiologically relevant mediator of O2 sensing by the carotid body. Furthermore, we propose that the targeting of AMPKα1 complexes to the plasma membrane of carotid body type 1 cells, the acute sensitivity of AMPK to changes in the AMP/ATP ratio, and a reliance of these cells on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production underpin the activation of type I cells by relatively small, physiological changes in arterial pO2. Thus, in addition to its ubiquitous role in regulating metabolism in response to metabolic stress at the cellular level, the AMPK signaling pathway has become adapted to mediate the responses of physiological systems that are key to meeting the metabolic needs of the whole body, including hypoxia-response coupling in O2-sensing cells."
https://openalex.org/W2056515822,"Lovastatin promotes osteoblast differentiation by increasing bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression. We demonstrate that lovastatin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), leading to an increase in its kinase activity in osteoblast cells. Inhibition of PI3K ameliorated expression of the osteogenic markers alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, osteopontin, and BMP-2. Expression of dominant-negative PI3K and PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3K signaling, significantly attenuated lovastatin-induced transcription of BMP-2. Akt kinase was also activated in a PI3K-dependent manner. However, our data suggest involvement of an additional signaling pathway. Lovastatin-induced Erk1/2 activity contributed to BMP-2 transcription. Inhibition of PI3K abrogated Erk1/2 activity in response to lovastatin, indicating the presence of a signal relay between them. We provide, as a mechanism of this cross-talk, the first evidence that lovastatin stimulates rapid activation of Ras, which associates with and activates PI3K in the plasma membrane, which in turn regulates Akt and Erk1/2 to induce BMP-2 expression for osteoblast differentiation."

Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acid polypeptide that is highly conserved from yeast to human. It is covalently ligated to a wide variety of target proteins through the action of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 3The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; Ub, ubiquitin; Ubl, ubiquitin-like molecules; ULP, Ubl-specific proteases; DUB, deubiquitinating enzymes; SUMO, small Ub-related modifier; UfSP, Ufm1-specific protease; MBP, maltose-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CBD, chitin binding domain; Bz, N-benzoxycarbonyl; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; VME, vinylmethylester; MESNa, 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; HA, hemagglutinin. ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3). Proteins modified by multiple units of ubiquitin are degraded by the 26 S proteasome (1Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Although the role as a tag for protein degradation by the proteasome has been known as a major function of ubiquitin, numerous other functions of ubiquitination have been identified (2Deng L. Wang C.

Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). For example, monoubiquitination is not involved in the protein degradation pathway but plays a role in distinct cellular processes, such as histone regulation, endocytosis, and budding of retroviruses from the plasma membrane. A number of other small proteins, so called ubiquitin-like molecules (Ubls), have been identified (8Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). These proteins are structurally related to ubiquitin and can be conjugated to various target proteins in a similar manner with ubiquitin (9Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Chiba T. Mol.

However, covalent attachment of Ubls does not result in degradation of the modified proteins but functions in a similar way to monoubiquitination. To date, nearly 10 Ubls including SUMO, NEDD8, and ISG15 have been identified. Of these, the best characterized Ubl is the mammalian SUMO-1 (13Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 14Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 15Dohmen R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar) that is conjugated to a variety of cellular proteins including transcription factors or their co-regulators. Protein modification by Ub is a reversible process that is catalyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) (18D'Andrea A. Pellman D. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 19Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 20Nijman S.M.

DUBs consist of five families that have distinct catalytic domain structures: the ubiquitin-specific protease family, the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase family, the ovarian tumor protease family, the Machado-Joseph disease protein family, and the Jab1/MPN/Mov34-domain protease family (21Kim J.H.

Although the Jab1/MPN/Mov34-domain protease family members are metallo-proteases, the other family members are cysteine proteases. Protein modification by Ubls is also a reversible process that is catalyzed by Ubl-specific proteases (ULPs). For example, deconjugation of SUMO is conducted by SUMO-specific proteases, called SENP or SUSP (13Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 16Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Chung C.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). In cells, Ub and most Ubls are not synthesized as a free form but as precursors with C-terminal extensions. Thus, DUBs and ULPs play an important role in the generation of free Ub and Ubl monomers in addition to their role in the reversal of protein modification by matured Ub and Ubl molecules. A new ubiquitin-like protein, Ufm1 (ubiquitin-fold modifier 1), has recently been identified (26Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Natsume T. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). It shares only 16% sequence identity with Ub but displays a striking similarity in its tertiary structure to Ub (27Sasakawa H. Sakata E. Yamaguchi Y. Komatsu M. Tatsumi K. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Kato K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has a single Gly at its C terminus, unlike Ub and most other Ubls that have a conserved C-terminal diglycine motif. Ufm1 in mouse and human is expressed as a precursor with a C-terminal Ser-Cys dipeptide extension that needs to be processed prior to conjugation to target proteins. The matured Ufm1 is specifically activated by an E1-like enzyme, Uba5, and then transferred to its cognate E2-like enzyme, Ufc1. The Ufm1 system is conserved in metazoa and plants but not in yeast, implicating its important roles in various multicellular organisms. However, the enzymes responsible for the processing of Ufm1 precursor as well as for the reversal of protein conjugation by matured Ufm1 have not been identified so far. E3-like enzymes for the ligation of Ufm1 to target proteins have not been identified either. In the present study, we report the isolation, cloning, and characterization of two novel mouse Ufm1-specific proteases, named UfSP1 and UfSP2. Like most DUBs and ULPs, UfSP1 and UfSP2 belong to the family of cysteine proteases. However, they show no sequence homology to previously known proteases. Both enzymes could process the C-terminal extension of Ufm1 precursor, thus generating matured Ufm1 for conjugation to target proteins. Moreover, they were capable of releasing free Ufm1 molecules from Ufm1-conjugated cellular proteins. Thus, UfSP1 and UfSP2 may play an important role in the reversal of protein modification by Ufm1 as well as in the processing of Ufm1 precursor. Plasmids—pQE30-GST-Ufm1-Ecotin was constructed as described previously (28Kang S.H. Park J.J. Chung S.S. Bang O.S. Chung C.H. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). UfSP1 and UfSP2 cDNAs encoding the 217-amino acid LOC70240 (GenBank™ accession number: NM_027356) and the 461-amino acid LOC192169 (accession number: NM_138668) were amplified from a mouse cDNA library, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into BamHI and SalI sites of pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs). pGEX-Ufm1, pGEX-Ufm1-HA, pGEX-Ub-HA, pGEX-SUMO-1-HA, and pGEX-ISG15-HA were generated as described previously (26Komatsu M. Chiba T. Tatsumi K. Iemura S. Tanida I. Okazaki N. Ueno T. Kominami E. Natsume T. Tanaka K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To generate an in-frame fusion of Ufm1 with the intein-chitin binding domain (Ufm1-intein-CBD), the cDNA for matured Ufm1 that lacks the C-terminal Gly was amplified by PCR and cloned into the NdeI and SapI sites of pTYB1 vector (New England Biolabs). FLAG-tagged Ufm1-intein-CBD was then generated by inserting the coding sequence for FLAG into the NdeI site. Site-directed mutagenesis of UfSP1 and UfSP2 was performed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. All sequences of the above mentioned constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification—MBP-, GST-, and intein-CBD-fused proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta strain, and His6-tagged proteins were in the M15 strain. They were then purified by using appropriate affinity resins. Assay of Ufm1-processing Activity—Ufm1-processing activity was assayed by using His-GST-Ufm1-Ecotin as a substrate as described previously (28Kang S.H. Park J.J. Chung S.S. Bang O.S. Chung C.H. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with purified His-GST-Ufm1-Ecotin in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation, the mixtures were heated for 10 min at 95 °C in a water bath. They were added with bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 0.02% and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. Aliquots of the supernatants were mixed with 2 μl of 1 μg/ml trypsin and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 90 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm CaCl2. They were added with 10 μl of 1 mm N-benzoxycarbonyl-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Bz-R-AMC) on ice. The release of AMC from Bz-R-AMC was then monitored continuously by incubation of the samples at 37 °C in a fluorometer (FLUOSTAR optima). Ufm1-processing activity was also assayed by incubation of enzyme samples with GST-Ufm1-HA. After incubation, the mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 for separation of GST-Ufm1 from GST-Ufm1-HA. Fractionation of Ufm1-processing Activity—To fractionate Ufm1-processing activity, extracts were prepared from mouse liver, brain, and kidney tissues and dialyzed against buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The dialyzed extracts were precipitated by 40–60% (NH4)2SO4. Precipitated proteins were dialyzed against buffer A and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. Fractions showing high activity toward His-GST-Ufm1-Ecotin were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 6.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), and loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column. Unbound proteins were collected, dialyzed against buffer A containing 1.2 m with (NH4)2SO4, and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column. Active fractions, which were eluted with 0.2–0.4 m (NH4)2SO4, were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and further fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose-12 column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. Labeling of UfSPs with FLAG-Ufm1-VME—FLAG-tagged Ufm1-vinylmethylester (FLAG-Ufm1-VME) was synthesized as described previously (29Hemelaar J. Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Reverter D. Cook J. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Gill G. Lima C.D. Ploegh H.L. Ovaa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 84-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). FLAG-Ufm1-intein-CBD that had been bound to chitin affinity resin was treated with 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNa) to generate FLAG-Ufm1-MESNa (29Hemelaar J. Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Reverter D. Cook J. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Gill G. Lima C.D. Ploegh H.L. Ovaa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 84-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Gly-VME was added to 0.5 ml of FLAG-Ufm1-MESNa (1 mg/ml) to a final concentration of 0.25 m followed by the addition of 75 μl of 2 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 30 μl of 2 m NaOH. After incubation at 37 °C for 6 h, the reaction was terminated by treatment with 30 μl of 2 m HCl. The samples were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and loaded onto an S-Sepharose cation exchange column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5). After washing with 5 column volumes of the same buffer, bound proteins (i.e. FLAG-Ufm1-VME) were eluted by stepwise increase in NaCl concentration. For labeling UfSPs with FLAG-Ufm1-VME, enzyme samples were incubated with FLAG-Ufm1-VME for 2 h at 37 °C in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm EDTA and 10% glycerol. They were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Identification of UfSP1 Labeled by FLAG-Ufm1-VME—The active fractions from Superose-12 column were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C with 0.35 mg of FLAG-Ufm1-VME. The samples were added with anti-FLAG antibody that had been conjugated to Sepharose beads. After incubation of the mixtures overnight at 4 °C, beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 3.0) at 4 °C and dialyzed against distilled water. Dialyzed samples were concentrated to 30 μl, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and silver-stained. Protein bands with the sizes of 30–35 kDa were cut out from the gels and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis using a Q-TOF micro-tandem mass spectrometer (IN2GEN Co.). Northern Analysis—Northern blot was performed using mouse adult total RNA blot (Seegene) and ExpressHyb (BD Biosciences) solution. All procedures followed the manufacturer’s instructions. As probes, the entire coding sequence for UfSP1 and the nucleotide sequence of 1–717 for UfSP2 were labeled using a Random Primer DNA labeling kit (Takara). Fractionation of Ufm1-processing Activity—To identify the proteases capable of processing the C-terminal extension of Ufm1, we adapted the recently developed method for assaying DUBs by using His-GST-Ufm1-Ecotin as the substrate (28Kang S.H. Park J.J. Chung S.S. Bang O.S. Chung C.H. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This method utilizes an unusual property of the E. coli trypsin inhibitor protein Ecotin, which is stable even after heating at 100 °C (30Chung C.H. Ives H.E. Almeda S. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11032-11038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation of His-GST-Ufm1-Ecotin with enzyme samples, one of the reaction products, His-GST-Ufm1, was precipitated by boiling in a water bath. The supernatant containing the other reaction product (i.e. heat-stable Ecotin) was then assayed for its ability to inhibit trypsin. Using this assay method, we fractionated Ufm1-processing activity from mouse tissue extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purification procedure was summarized in Fig. 1A. In the final Superose-12 column chromatography step, a peak of trypsin inhibitory activity was eluted in the fraction that corresponds to a size of about 25 kDa (Fig. 1B, upper panel). To verify that the trypsin inhibitory activity is indeed mediated by Ufm1-processing activity, His-GST-Ufm1-Ecotin was incubated with the same column fractions for 1 h at 37°C, and the mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. The extents of substrate cleavage into His-GST-Ufm1 and Ecotin correlated well with those of trypsin inhibitory activity (Fig. 1B, lower panel), indicating that Ufm1-processing activity is responsible for the trypsin inhibition. The active fractions (number 33–35) were pooled, concentrated to 0.5 ml, and referred to as the S12 fraction. Labeling of UfSP1 by FLAG-Ufm1-VME—Aliquots of the active fractions from Superose-12 column (i.e. before pooling and concentration) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. However, we could not find any relevant protein band that matched Ufm1-processing activity (data not shown). To identify the protein(s) responsible for Ufm1-processing activity, FLAG-Ufm1-VME was synthesized and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the S12 fraction in the presence or absence of 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a sulfhydryl blocking agent. The incubation mixtures were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG antibody. A new 34-kDa band appeared in the mixture incubated with FLAG-Ufm1-VME in the absence of NEM but not in its presence (Fig. 2A, upper panel), suggesting that a Cys residue of putative Ufm1-specific protease is labeled by FLAG-Ufm1-VME. To determine the effect of FLAG-Ufm1-VME on Ufm1-processing activity, the S12 fraction was also incubated with His-GST-Ufm1-HA for 1 h at 37°C. Both FLAG-Ufm1-VME and NEM strongly inhibited the Ufm1-processing activity of the enzyme sample (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Collectively, these results suggest that the protein labeled with FLAG-Ufm1-VME represents an Ufm1-specific protease (UfSP). Henceforth, the labeled protein in the S12 fraction is referred to as UfSP1. To determine whether the labeling by FLAG-Ufm1-VME is specific to UfSP1, HA-Ub-VME was synthesized and incubated with the enzyme for 10 min at 37 °C. The mixture was further incubated in the absence or presence of FLAG-Ufm1-VME for the next for 30 min. Fig. 2B (upper panel) shows that UfSP1 can be labeled by FLAG-Ufm1-VME whether or not HA-Ub-VME is present. Moreover, HA-Ub-VME showed little or no effect on Ufm1-processing activity of UfSP1 or on the ability of FLAG-Ufm1-VME to inhibit the UfSP1 activity (Fig. 2B, lower panel). These results suggest that UfSP1 specifically reacts with FLAG-Ufm1-VME. Identification of UfSP1 by Mass Spectrometry—To identify UfSP1, the S12 fraction was incubated with FLAG-Ufm1-VME followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. Precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 3A). Protein bands in the gels with the sizes ranging from 30 to 35 kDa were then sliced, treated with trypsin, and subjected to tandem mass spectrometric analysis. Proteins that matched with the identified sequences included Ufm1 and a previously uncharacterized hypothetical mouse protein LOC70240 (accession number: gi 13899211) in addition to immunoglobulin and nuclear transport factor, which were not expected to interact with FLAG-Ufm1-VME (Fig. 3B). The estimated size of LOC70240, consisting of 217 amino acids, is 23 kDa, and that of FLAG-Ufm1-VME is about 10 kDa. Therefore, the sum of their sizes is well correlated with the 34-kDa band that appeared upon incubation of FLAG-Ufm1-VME with the S12 fraction. These results strongly suggest that LOC70240 corresponds to UfSP1. Cloning, Expression, and Characterization of UfSP1 and UfSP2—BLAST search (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) for the identified sequence led to the finding of an additional hypothetical mouse protein LOC192169 (accession number: AAH05503) that is homologous to UfSP1 (Fig. 4A). LOC192169, named as UfSP2, is comprised of 461 amino acids with an estimated size of about 46 kDa. Although the C-terminal region (238–461) of UfSP2 showed 33.3% identity and 45.6% similarity in amino acid sequence to UfSP1, the extended N-terminal sequence is unique to UfSP2. Similar to DUBs and ULPs, both UfSP1 and UfSP2 have highly conserved Cys and His residues that form a catalytic triad for cysteine proteases (Fig. 4B). However, neither UfSP1 nor UfSP2 showed any sequence similarity to known DUBs and ULPs, indicating that UfSPs form a new subfamily of cysteine proteases. To investigate the expression of UfSP1 and UfSP2 mRNAs, Northern analysis was performed using 32P-labeled full-length cDNA of UfSP1 (651 bp) and 5′-region of UfSP2 (717 bp) as probes. Although UfSP1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues tested, its level was significantly higher in brain, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle than in other tissues (Fig. 4C). Unlike UfSP2 mRNA, two transcripts for UfSP1 were detected in most of the tissues examined, which might have been derived from alternative splicing or the use of alternative promoters. The levels of UfSP2 mRNA in brain, kidney, stomach, skeletal muscle, and testis were higher than those in other tissues. The cDNAs for UfSP1 (accession number: NM_027356) and UfSP2 (accession number: NM_138668) were cloned into pMAL-c2x. MBP-fused UfSP1 and UfSP2 proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified by using amylose affinity resin (Fig. 5A). Mutant forms of UfSP1 and UfSP2, in which Cys-53 and Cys-294, respectively, in the Cys boxes were replaced by Ser, were also purified by using the same affinity resin. We then examined whether the Cys residues serve as the reactive sites for FLAG-Ufm1-VME. Purified UfSPs and their mutant forms were incubated in the absence or presence of FLAG-Ufm1-VME for 10 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG antibody. Fig. 5B shows that both UfSP1 and UfSP2, but not their mutants (UfSP1/C53S and UfSP2/C294S), can be labeled by FLAG-Ufm1-VME, indicating that the Cys residues are the Ufm1-VME reactive sites. We next examined whether UfSP1 and UfSP2 indeed have Ufm1-processing activity. Purified UfSPs and their mutant forms were incubated with His-GST-Ufm1-HA. Both UfSP1 and UfSP2, but not their mutant forms, were capable of releasing HA from GST-Ufm1-HA (Fig. 6), indicating that Cys-53 and Cys-294 serve as the catalytic residues in UfSP1 and UfSP2, respectively. Notably, UfSP2 was much less efficient in the hydrolysis of GST-Ufm1-HA than UfSP1. Although 50 ng of UfSP1 cleaved about 50% of GST-Ufm1-HA (Fig. 6A), nearly 3 μg of UfSP2 was required to hydrolyze it to a similar extent (Fig. 6B). Collectively, these results suggest that the maturation of Ufm1 precursor is catalyzed mainly by UfSP1 in cells. To determine whether UfSP1 and UfSP2 indeed cleave the peptide bond linked to the C-terminal Gly residue of Ufm1, the enzymes were incubated with GST-Ufm1(VA)-HA, in which the C-terminal Gly of Ufm1 was replaced by Ala. Unlike GST-Ufm1(VG)-HA, GST-Ufm1(GA)-HA was not cleaved by either of the enzymes (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that both UfSP1 and UfSP2 are authentic Ufm1-processing proteases. Substrate Specificity of UfSPs—To determine the substrate specificity of UfSPs, purified enzymes were incubated with GST-Ufm1-HA, GST-Ub-HA, GST-SUMO1-HA, and GST-ISG15-HA. Fig. 7A shows that both UfSPs can cleave the C terminus of Ufm1 but not that of Ub, SUMO1, or ISG15. These results demonstrate that UfSPs act specifically on the C terminus of Ufm1. To determine whether UfSPs can release Ufm1 molecules that are conjugated to cellular proteins via isopeptide bonds, His-FLAG-Ufm1-HA was stably expressed in NIH3T3 cells. Ufm1-conjugated proteins were then pulled down from the cell lysates by treatment with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin. The resins were then incubated with purified UfSPs and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG antibody. At least five Ufm1-conjugated proteins with approximate sizes of 80, 70, 65, 45, and 32 kDa were generated (Fig. 7B). Incubation of the proteins with UfSP1 led to a decrease in their intensity, although to different extents. These results suggest that UfSP1 cleaves off Ufm1 from the Ufm1-conjugated cellular proteins. UfSP2 also reproducibly reduced the intensity of 45- and 32-kDa bands but only to a small extent. Thus, it remains unclear whether the 45- and 32-kDa Ufm1 conjugates represent true substrates for UfSP2. On the other hand, the active site mutants, UfSP1/C53S or UfSP2/C294S, could not hydrolyze any of them. These results demonstrate that UfSP1 can act on Ufm1-conjugated proteins as well as on Ufm1 precursor protein. These results also suggest that UfSP2 may have tighter substrate specificity on Ufm1-conjugated proteins than UfSP1, likely due to the presence of a unique N-terminal extension that may confer substrate specificity. In the present study, we report the isolation, molecular cloning, and characterization of two novel Ufm1-specific proteases, named UfSP1 and UfSP2. Both of the recombinant enzymes were capable of processing Ufm1 precursor and deconjugating Ufm1-modified cellular proteins. However, tissue extracts showed low Ufm1-processing activity toward Ufm1-peptide fusion, such as Ufm1-HA (data not shown). Therefore, for detection and isolation of Ufm1-processing activity from tissue extracts, we adapted a recently developed method for assaying DUBs using His-GST-Ufm1-Econtin as a substrate instead of His-GST-Ub-Ecotin (28Kang S.H. Park J.J. Chung S.S. Bang O.S. Chung C.H. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Using this method, we could partially purify UfSP1 from tissue extracts. However, we were unable to identify a protein that is responsible for Ufm1-processing activity, most likely due to the very low level of endogenous UfSP1 protein. To this end, we covalently labeled UfSP1 with FLAG-Ufm1-VME and identified its partial sequence by mass spectrometry. Moreover, data base searching with the identified sequence of UfSP1 led to the finding of an additional Ufm1-processing enzyme, named UfSP2. UfSP1 and UfSP2 show no sequence homology to previously known proteases, indicating that they represent novel Ufm1-specific proteases. Like DUBs and ULPs, UfSP1 and UfSP2 show typical features of cysteine proteases. Their activities are inhibited by NEM, although we could not exclude a possibility that the inhibitory effect of NEM might be due to its non-selective modification of cysteine residue(s) located outside the active site. Moreover, replacement of the active site Cys by Ser resulted in complete inactivation of UfSP1 and UfSP2. In addition, both of the purified enzymes, but not their mutant forms, could be covalently labeled by FLAG-Ufm1-VME, indicating that the active site Cys sulfhydryl is the reactive nucleophile covalently modifying the VME moiety. The activity of cysteine proteases typically depends on the catalytic action of Cys and His residues that are usually assisted by an Asp or Asn residue (19Amerik A.Y. Hochstrasser M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment revealed the presence of highly conserved His and Asp residues, suggesting that these residues together with the active site Cys form the catalytic triad of UfSPs. The conserved sequences around catalytic motifs and the sizes of UfSPs offer a basis to group UfSPs into two families: the UfSP1 family and the UfSP2 family. UfSP1 family members that have a size around 25 kDa are present in fly, mouse, and human, but not in plant or nematode. On the other hand, UfSP2 family members have a size larger than 40 kDa and can be found in most multicellular organisms, including Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis. In addition, UfSP2 family members have an N-terminal extension, which is not found in the UfSP1 family. Moreover, the amino acid sequences that form the Cys and His boxes in UfSP1 family are distinct from those of UfSP2 family. Nevertheless, the Gly-Trp-Gly-Cys motif of the Cys box and the Asp-Pro-His motif of the His box are well conserved in both UfSP families. The distance between the two motifs is also nearly the same in all UfSP1 and UfSP2 family members (data not shown). These features in the amino acid sequences of UfSP families suggest that significant selective pressure has existed for the maintenance of their active site structures in multicellular organism during evolution. Covalent modification of proteins by Ub and Ubls is a key mechanism for the control of cellular processes as diverse as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Reversal of this modification, catalyzed by DUBs and ULPs, also functions in the control of diverse cellular processes by regulating the fate and function of the proteins modified by Ub and Ubls. For example, the cellular functions of DUBs include the regulation of proteasome activity, protein stability, signal transduction, DNA repair, chromatin dynamics and transcription, and endocytosis. However, the cellular function of protein modification by Ufm1 or its reversal by UfSPs remains unknown because no target protein for Ufm1 modification has yet been identified. Identification of Ufm1 target proteins is currently under investigation."

The shell is deposited in a uterine fluid where the concentration of different protein species varies at different stages of its formation. The role of avian eggshell proteins during shell formation remains poorly understood, and we have sought to identify and characterize the individual components in order to gain insight into their function during elaboration of the eggshell. In this study, we have used direct sequencing, immunochemistry, expression screening, and EST data base mining to clone and characterize a 1995-bp full-length cDNA sequence corresponding to a novel chicken eggshell protein that we have named Ovocalyxin-36 (OCX-36). Ovocalyxin-36 protein was only detected in the regions of the oviduct where egg-shell formation takes place; uterine OCX-36 message was strongly up-regulated during eggshell calcification. OCX-36 localized to the calcified eggshell predominantly in the inner part of the shell, and to the shell membranes. BlastN data base searching indicates that there is no mammalian version of OCX-36; however, the protein sequence is 20–25% homologous to proteins associated with the innate immune response as follows: lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins, bactericidal permeability-increasing proteins, and Plunc family proteins. Moreover, the genomic organization of these proteins and OCX-36 appears to be highly conserved. These observations suggest that OCX-36 is a novel and specific chicken eggshell protein related to the superfamily of lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins/bactericidal permeability-increasing proteins and Plunc proteins.

The avian eggshell is a calcitic bioceramic, which possesses unique mechanical properties deriving from its complex a porous polycrystalline structure. It rests upon, and is continuous with, an underlying noncalcified meshwork of fibers. The eggshell membranes, the calcified (mammillary, cone, and palisade) layers and cuticle of the eggshell, are sequentially laid down upon the egg white in the distal part of the oviduct (isthmus and uterus). The eggshell mineral is associated with an organic matrix composed of proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, which are thought to influence the fabric of this biomaterial (1Nys Y. Gautron J. Garcia-Ruiz J.M. Hincke M.T. C. R. Palevol. 2004; 3: 549-562Crossref Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Matrix protein components have been identified in decalcified shell and in the uterine fluid bathing the egg during its formation, and this contains the organic and mineral precursors of the eggshell (2Gautron J. Hincke M.T. Nys Y. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 36: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Previously identified matrix protein components can be divided into three characteristic groups as follows: (i) “egg white” proteins, which are also present in the eggshell, and these include ovalbumin (3Hincke M.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 31: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), lysozyme (4Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Panheleux M. Garcia-Ruiz J.M. McKee M.D. Nys Y.

Tissue Res. 2001; 42: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); (ii) ubiquitous proteins that are found in many tissues, and this group includes osteopontin, a phosphorylated glycoprotein present in bone and other hard tissues (6Pines M.

McKee M.D. Bajari T. Schneider W.J. Hincke M.T. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); and (iii) matrix proteins unique to the shell calcification process that are secreted by cells in specific regions of the oviduct where egg-shell mineralization is initiated and continues to completion (red isthmus and uterus). OC-17 (Ovocleidin-17) was the first eggshell protein purified from the shell (10Hincke M.T. Tsang C.P. Courtney M. Hill V. Narbaitz R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is a C-type, lectin-like phosphoprotein of 17 kDa (11Mann K. Siedler F. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 997-1007PubMed Google Scholar) that occurs in glycosylated (23 kDa) and nonglycosylated forms in the shell matrix (12Mann K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). OC-116 (Ovocleidin-116) was the first eggshell matrix protein to be cloned (13Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Tsang C.P.

Recently, we described OCX-32 (Ovocalyxin-32), a 32-kDa uterine-specific protein that is concentrated in the outer calcified region and cuticle of the calcified shell (16Gautron J. Hincke M.T.

The natural defenses of the egg have two components as follows: one is the shell that acts as a physical barrier, and the other is a chemical system composed of endogenous antibacterial proteins that have been mainly identified in egg white (19Nau F. Anton M. Nys Y. 11th European Poultry Conference. 2002; (WPSA, German Branch, Bremen, Germany)Google Scholar). It has been shown that changes in eggshell properties are directly related to increasing risk of egg contamination and risk of food-borne outbreaks for consumers (20Messens W. Grijspeerdt K. Herman L. Worlds Poult. Sci. J. 2005; 61: 71-85Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that proteins with well known antimicrobial properties are specifically associated with the shell. Lysozyme is abundant in the limiting membrane that circumscribes the egg white and forms the innermost layer of the shell membranes. It is also present in the shell membranes and in the matrix and cuticle of the calcified shell (4Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Panheleux M. Garcia-Ruiz J.M. McKee M.D. Nys Y. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Ovotransferrin is localized in the calcified mammillae and particularly in the eggshell membranes, where it functions as a bacteriostatic filter to reinforce inhibition of Salmonella growth in egg white (5Gautron J. Hincke M.T. Panhé;leux M. Garcia-Ruiz J.M. Boldicke T. Nys Y. Connect. Tissue Res. 2001; 42: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the cloning, cDNA and protein sequence, genomic organization and regulation of expression of Ovocalyxin-36 (OCX-36), a novel eggshell-specific protein that is homologous to members of mammalian antibacterial protein families. This protein is the first example of an eggshell-specific protein that may participate in the natural chemical defense of the egg against bacteria. Collection of Uterine Fluid—Brown egg-laying hens (ISA brown strain) were caged individually and subjected to a cycle of 14 h of light followed by 10 h of darkness. They were fed a layer mash as recommended by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (21Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (1989) L'Alimentation des Animaux Monogastriques: Porc, Lapin, Volailles, 2nd Ed., Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, ParisGoogle Scholar). Each cage was equipped with a device for automatic recording of the time of oviposition (egg laying). Uterine fluid was collected as described previously (2Gautron J. Hincke M.T. Nys Y. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 36: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Egg expulsion was induced by intravenous injection of 50 μg of prostaglandin 2-α/hen at 6–9, 13–20, and 22–23 h after previous oviposition (the ovulation of the following egg coincides with this event, ±0.5 h). These time intervals correspond to the initiation, rapid growth, and final phase of shell mineralization, respectively. Uterine fluid was collected immediately after egg expulsion into a plastic tube placed at the entrance of the everted vagina. Aliquots of uterine fluid were immediately diluted 1:1 with 0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.125% bromphenol blue for electrophoresis. Tissue Collection—Tissues (eight samples for each organ and each stage) of the oviduct (magnum, white and red isthmus, and uterus) and other organs (liver, kidney, duodenum, and muscle) were harvested from birds when an egg was in the magnum (3–4-h post-oviposition, phase of albumen secretion onto the yolk) or during the rapid growth phase of calcification (16–18 h post-oviposition). Additionally, uterine tissues of birds at various physiological phases related to sexual maturity and egg formation were collected from the following: (i) 10 immature birds (15 weeks old) with a developing oviduct before the initiation of egg production; (ii) 10 adult hens in which 50 μg of prostaglandin 2-α was injected during 3 consecutive days to expel the egg before mineralization had begun; and (iii) 10 additional birds in which the uterus was collected during eggshell calcification. Extraction and Solubilization of Matrix Proteins—Eggshell matrix proteins were extracted as described (5Gautron J. Hincke M.T. Panhé;leux M. Garcia-Ruiz J.M. Boldicke T. Nys Y. Connect. Tissue Res. 2001; 42: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The shells were rinsed with running tap water and then washed in 154 mm NaCl. Four methods were used for the preparation of shell to ensure the removal of shell membranes from the inner part of the calcified shell. (i) Membranes were mechanically removed using forceps. (ii) Each egg was filled with 130 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, for 30 min, followed by the mechanical removal of the membranes using forceps. The egg was then filled again with the same solution for another 30 min. (iii) Eggs were filled with 130 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, for 30 min, and the membranes were mechanically removed. The eggs were filled again with 1 n HCl for 5 min. (iv) Eggs were filled with 130 mm EDTA, pH 8.5, for 30 min, and the membranes were mechanically removed. The eggs were filled again with 0.1 n HCl for 20 min. Following these treatments to remove all associated shell membranes, shells were then ground to a fine powder. Powdered shells were then decalcified overnight at 4 °C in 20% acetic acid. The suspension was dialyzed (cutoff 3500 Da) against demineralized water and lyophilized. This powder was extracted overnight at 4 °C with 4 m guanidine hydrochloride in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, containing protease inhibitors (5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 100 mm amino-n-caproic acid, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation the supernatant was dialyzed against water (cutoff of 3500 Da) and then concentrated. The final preparations of soluble matrix proteins under these conditions are referred to as egg-shell protein extracts. Antibody Preparation—Two preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (3 mm width) were loaded with uterine fluid samples harvested at the rapid growth phase of calcification (8 mg of protein). After electrophoresis the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and then thoroughly rinsed with demineralized water. The 32–36-kDa band was excised and ground into a fine powder with a Spex freezer mill. The powder was suspended in 154 mm NaCl, mixed 1:1 with Freund’s complete adjuvant, and injected into two adult female New Zealand rabbits. The animals were boosted seven times, at 3-week intervals, with the same antigen preparation in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant to obtain a satisfactory titer. Additionally, an antiserum (Ab 2The abbreviations used are: Ab, antibody; LBP, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; BPI, bactericidal permeability-increasing protein; RT, reverse transcription; nt, nucleotides; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAPS, 3-cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulfonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; INRA, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique; EST, expressed sequenced tag. Ocx36-(51–65)) was prepared against a 15-amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to a sequence near the N terminus of the OCX-36 protein (residues 51–65, KHLQGMALPNIMSDR). The peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for immunization of two adult female New Zealand rabbits. For the first injection (day 0), the antigen (200 μg) was mixed with Freund’s complete adjuvant. Subsequent boosting with antigen emulsified in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant was performed at days 14, 28, 49, and 70. At day 77, animals were sacrificed and the sera collected. SDS-PAGE and Electroblotting—The protein concentration of each sample was determined by the Bradford procedure (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) using ovalbumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE and electroblotting were performed on a 4–20% gradient gel or 12% isocratic gels as already described (2Gautron J. Hincke M.T. Nys Y. Connect. Tissue Res. 1997; 36: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Gautron J. Hincke M.T. Mann K. Panhé;leux M. Bain M. McKee M.D. Solomon S.E. Nys Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39243-39252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Uterine fluid samples and eggshell extracts were prepared in SDS-PAGE buffer (0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.125% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min prior to loading onto the gels. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted (0.8 mA/cm2) onto the following: (i) either polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Hyperbond, Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, CA) in 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, 10% methanol for microsequencing, (ii) or nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol for Western blot analysis. Western Blotting—Nitrocellulose membranes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 0.01 m phosphate buffer, 0.0027 m potassium chloride, 0.137 m sodium chloride, pH 7.4) and blocked for 1 h in Odyssey blocking buffer (Odyssey, LI-COR Biosciences Inc., Lincoln, NE). The membranes were then incubated for 60 min with Ab Ocx36-(51–65) (1:3,000 in Odyssey blocking buffer). After four washes (5 min each) in PBS/Tween (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20), the membranes were incubated for 1 h with 1:5,000 Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) in Odyssey blocking buffer. The membranes were then washed four times in PBS/Tween and then twice in PBS. The membranes were scanned using an Infrared Imaging System (Odyssey, LI-COR Biosciences Inc., Lincoln, NE) in the 700 nm channel. Prestained molecular weight standards are visible on the blot in this channel. Microsequencing—N-terminal and internal microsequencing of the 32–36-kDa protein collected at the rapid growth phase was performed. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransfered onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue, 40% methanol, and 1% acetic acid for a few minutes and destained in 50% methanol until the bands became clearly visible. The 32–36-kDa Coomassie Blue-stained band was excised, directly loaded into a protein sequencer, and subjected to N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation in an LF 3000 protein sequencer (Beckman Instruments). Alternatively, the 32–36-kDa band was subjected to trypsin digestion for internal microsequencing by standard protocols. The resulting fragments were separated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and then injected into the protein sequencer. Mass Spectrometry—The uterine fluid collected at the rapid growth phase was separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The Coomassie Blue-stained band corresponding to the 32–36-kDa band was cut with a scalpel into small blocks. The blocks were rinsed and then reduced and alkylated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide. They were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a microtube with 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (sequencing grade; Roche Applied Science) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 as described previously (23Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The tryptic fragments were extracted, dried, reconstituted with 0.1% formic acid, and sonicated for 10 min. Tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI L/R P/N; Waters). The α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (5 mg/ml dissolved in 50% ethanol, 50% acetonitrile) and the sample (1:1, v/v) were loaded on the target using the dried droplet method. The analyses were performed in positive ion reflector mode, with an accelerating voltage of 15,000 V. For subsequent data processing, the MassLynx 4.0 software (Waters) was used. Spectra obtained were calibrated externally using the [M + H]+ ions from bovine serum albumin digest. A mass deviation of 0.1 Da was allowed for data interpretation. Peptides were sequenced by nano-LC-MS/MS (CapLC coupled to a Q-TOF-Global equipped with a nano-ESI source; Waters). Only doubly and triply charged ions were allowed to be selected as precursors over a mass range of 400–1300 m/z. The collision energy was selected depending on the precursor ion mass and charge. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using the fragmentation spectrum of Glufibrinopeptide (Sigma), 500 fmol/μl in 50:50 water/acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. The peptides were loaded on a precolumn (monolithic trap column, 200 μm × 5 mm; Dionex) and desalted with 0.1% formic acid for 5 min at 25 μl/min, followed by separation on a C18 column (Atlantis™ dC18; 3 μm, 75 μm × 150 mm; Nano Ease™, Waters), eluted with a 5–60% linear gradient (buffer A: water/acetonitrile 98:2 (v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid; buffer B: water/acetonitrile 20:80 (v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid) over 60 min at a flow rate of 180 nl/min. The peptide masses and sequences obtained were matched automatically to proteins in a nonredundant data base (NCBI) using the Mascot program. cDNA Expression Screening—The cDNA library was prepared from uterine tissue harvested during the active phase of eggshell calcification as described previously (13Hincke M.T. Gautron J. Tsang C.P. McKee M.D. Nys Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32915-32923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis was induced with 10 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The phage library was screened using antiserum raised to the 32–36-kDa uterine fluid protein (1:1000) and anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:3000) as secondary antibody and detected with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo 4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Phage with positive inserts were purified to homogeneity by three rounds of screening and rescued into Bluescript plasmid using helper phage. Plasmid DNA was isolated by alkaline lysis miniprep, and the cDNA inserts were sequenced by automated protocols at the sequencing service of INRA-Centre de Tours, Nouzilly, France. Hybridization Screening—A clone with a novel insert of 1019 bases in length was obtained by expression screening (see above). PCR primers were designed using this sequence (36-H1/36-H2; Table 1) and used for RT-PCR to investigate the expression of this message in different segments of the oviduct and in liver. PCR product was only detected in the uterine portion of the oviduct. The 525-bp PCR product was labeled (digoxigenin, Roche Applied Science) and used for hybridization screening of the same library to obtain longer inserts. In this manner, six independent clones were isolated and sequenced by automated protocols at the BRI sequencing service of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Canada. Two of the clones contained potentially full-length inserts of 1710 bp.TABLE 1List of primers used for RT-PCRPrimer labelPrimer sequencePosition relative tocDNA sequenceCoding sequence36-H1AGTCTGAACGTCCGCCTG1237-12541111-112836-H2TAGCAGCAGCATCCCATG1795-17771667-164936-F1TTGGAATGGTCGTCTTCTGTGG146-16720-4136-B1CGGTCTGAATGATGGCATCG265-246139-12036-F2GGCATTCTGTCTGAGGTGATCG466-487340-36136-B2GCAGTCATCAACAGTGACGTGG573-552447-42636-F3ATTGGGATGCAGTTGGTCGTCACC409-432283-30636-B3GAAGGTGTATGGCTGGATATGGAG990-967864-841 Open table in a new tab Reverse Transcriptase-PCR and mRNA Levels by Real Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissue samples using a commercial kit (RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and simultaneously treated with DNase (RNase-free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentrations were measured by absorption at 260 nm, and the quality of RNA was electrophoretically evaluated on a 1% agarose gel. Samples of total RNA (2 μg) were reverse-transcribed using RNase H– Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences). Classical PCR was performed to amplify nt 146–265 and nt 409–990 of the OCX-36 cDNA, using the 36-F1 forward/36-B1 reverse primers and 36-F3 forward/36-B3 reverse primers (Table 1) for 30 cycles at 60 and 65 °C respectively. Alternatively, OCX-36 cDNA was amplified in real time using the qPCR Master mix plus for Sybr Green I (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) with the ABI PRISM 7000 apparatus (Applied Biosystems). To account for variations in mRNA extraction and reverse transcription reaction between samples, OCX-36 mRNA levels were corrected relative to ribosomal 18 S rRNA levels. The latter were measured using a TaqMan universal PCR master mix and predeveloped TaqMan assay reagents for human 18 S rRNA (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, France) as validated previously (9Mann K. Gautron J. Nys Y. McKee M.D. Bajari T. Schneider W.J. Hincke M.T. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Four specific primers were chosen from the OCX-36 cDNA sequence (Table 1). The combination of 36-F1/36-B1 primers and of 36-F2/36-B2 primers allowed the amplification of 121- and 109-bp fragments, respectively (Table 1). The cycling conditions consisted of a uracil-N-glycosylase preincubation step at 50 °C for 2 min, followed by a denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of amplification (denaturation for 15 s at 95 °C, annealing and elongation for 1 min at 60 °C). A melting curve program was carried out from 60 to 95 °C in 20 min for each individual sample amplified with Sybr Green. Samples showed a single product with a specific melting temperature of 84 °C for the combination of 36-F1/36-B1 and of 78 °C for the combination of 36-F2/36-B2. Each sample was diluted, and then amplified in triplicate in the same run. Each run included triplicates of no template controls and triplicates of control cDNA corresponding to a pool of uterine cDNA from laying hens sampled during eggshell formation. The control cDNA was diluted from 1:50 to 1:156,250, and relative arbitrary quantities were defined. The threshold cycle (CT), defined as the cycle at which fluorescence rises above a defined base line, was determined for each sample and control cDNA. A calibration curve was calculated using the CT values of the control cDNA samples, and relative amount of unknown samples were deduced from this curve. The PCR efficiencies for 36-F1/36-B1, 36-F2/36-B2, and 18 S rRNA were 95, 102, and 98%, respectively. The ratio value was calculated for each sample as OCX-36/18 S rRNA. The log of the ratio was used for statistical analysis using StatView software (SAS Institute Inc. version 5). A one-way analysis of variance was performed to detect significant differences in OCX-36 expression in organs at various physiological phases. Radiation Hybrid Mapping—Radiation hybrid mapping was performed on the ChickRH6 panel (24Morisson M. Lemiere A. Bosc S. Galan M. Plisson-Petit F. Pinton P. Delcros C. Feve K. Pitel F. Fillon V. Yerle M. Vignal A. Genet. Sel. Evol. 2002; 34: 521-533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The left primer (gctgaagctttttggaatgg) and right primer (ctgggtgggtgagagcag) were designed using the Primer3 software, available on line. PCR was performed in 15 μl, containing 25 ng of hybrid DNA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 1× buffer (Invitrogen), 200 μm of each dNTP, 0.2 μm of each primer, and 1× loading buffer (350 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm cresol). After denaturation for 10 min at 94 °C, 35 PCR cycles were performed (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C), followed by a final elongation step of 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. Chicken DNA was used as positive control, and hamster DNA and TE (Tris-EDTA) buffer served as negative controls. Immunolocalization of OCX-36 in Eggshell and Uterus—Thin sections of oviduct tissues and decalcified eggshell were prepared and immunostained as described previously (3Hincke M.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 31: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 10Hincke M.T. Tsang C.P. Courtney M. Hill V. Narbaitz R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 56: 578-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In brief, tissues from two hens were removed 2 h after oviposition, fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 24 h, and then equilibrated in sucrose before dehydration and embedding in paraffin wax. Pieces of shell were fixed and decalcified at room temperature in a 1:1 mixture of 150 mm Na-EDTA, pH 7.7, and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. When samples were sufficiently decalcified (3–4 days on average), they were transferred to PBS to rinse out the decalcifying reagent. To offer support, the shell pieces were pre-embedded flat in heated 2% agar, 10% formalin solution (45 °C). The agar block was solidified at room temperature and then processed as usual in an automatic tissue processor (Triangular Biomedical Systems). Paraffin blocks were prepared with a tissue embedding center (Leica EG 1160) by orienting the agar block to show the cross-section of the egg shell. Sections (4 μm) were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated through an ethanol series into TBS (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 150 mm NaCl), and then incubated with antiserum raised to the OCX-36 synthetic peptide (Ab OCX-36-(51–65)) at various dilutions in TBS containing 0.3% Triton X-1"
https://openalex.org/W2015686826,"It was originally thought that the critical role of the CD40 ligand (CD40L) in normal and inflammatory immune responses was mainly mediated through its interaction with the classic receptor, CD40. However, data from CD40L–/– and CD40–/– mice suggest that the CD40L-induced inflammatory immune response involves at least one other receptor. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that CD40L stabilizes arterial thrombi through an αIIbβ3-dependent mechanism. Here we provide evidence that soluble CD40L (sCD40L) binds to cells of the undifferentiated human monocytic U937 cell line in a CD40- and αIIbβ3-independent manner. Binding of sCD40L to U937 cells was inhibited by anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody 5C8, anti-α5β1 monoclonal antibody P1D6, and soluble α5β1. The direct binding of sCD40L to purified α5β1 was confirmed in a solid phase binding assay. Binding of sCD40L to α5β1 was modulated by the form of α5β1 expressed on the cell surface as the activation of α5β1 by Mn2+ or dithiothreitol resulted in the loss of sCD40L binding. Moreover, sCD40L induced the translocation of α5β1 to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of U937 cells, the rapid activation of the MAPK pathways ERK1/2, and interleukin-8 gene expression. The binding of sCD40L to CD40 on BJAB cells, an α5β1-negative B cell line, and the resulting activation of ERK1/2 was not inhibited by soluble α5β1, suggesting that sCD40L can bind concomitantly to both receptors. These results document the existence of novel CD40L-dependent pathways of physiological relevance for cells expressing multiple receptors (CD40, α5β1, and αIIbβ3) for CD40L.

The main sources of CD154 are activated platelets and CD4+ T cells (1Andre P. Nannizzi-Alaimo L. Prasad S.K. Phillips D.R. Circulation. 2002; 106: 896-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). CD154 is also variably expressed on activated CD8+ T cells, activated B cells, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages as well as endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and smooth muscle cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Schonbeck U. Libby P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of CD40L differs according to cell types and type of stimuli (2Schonbeck U. Libby P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of CD154 is inducible, and its expression on T cells is triggered primarily by T cell receptor signaling and is regulated by CD28-dependent and independent pathways (3Ding L. Green J. Thompson C. Shevach E. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5124-5132PubMed Google Scholar) CD40L is stored in platelets and a subpopulation of T cells and rapidly translocates to the cell membrane following T cell and platelet activation (4Casamayor-Palleja M. Khan M. MacLennan I.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 5Henn V. Slupsky J.R. Grafe M. Anagnostopoulos I. Forster R. Muller-Berghaus G. Kroczek R.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). A soluble form of biologically active CD40L trimer (sCD40L) is present in the supernatant of activated T cells (6Pietravalle F. Lecoanet-Henchoz S. Blasey H. Aubry J.P. Elson G.

Ochs H.D. Mizutani S. J. Med. Dent. Sci. 2001; 48: 23-27PubMed Google Scholar) and results from the proteolytic cleavage of the homotrimeric CD40L by a metalloproteinase (7Jin Y. Nonoyama S. Morio T. Imai K. Ochs H.D. Mizutani S. J. Med. Dent. Sci. 2001; 48: 23-27PubMed Google Scholar). It was originally thought that CD40L had only one receptor, CD40, which is a type I transmembrane protein that is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. CD40 is expressed on the surface of many immune and non-immune cells, including B lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells, as well as platelets, epithelial, and endothelial cells (8Grammer A.C. Lipsky P.E. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 61-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most biological functions of CD40L have been attributed to its direct interaction with CD40. However, studies using CD40L–/– and CD40–/– mice have suggested that CD40L may also bind to one or more other receptors (9Mehlhop P.D. van de Rijn M. Brewer J.P. Kisselgof A.B. Geha R.S. Oettgen H.C. Martin T.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 23: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, it has been elegantly demonstrated that sCD40L interacts with αIIbβ3 (GPIIb/IIIa), an integrin expressed on platelets (10Andre P. Prasad K.S. Denis C.V. He M. Papalia J.M. Hynes R.O. Phillips D.R. Wagner D.D. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), triggering outside-in signaling and inducing platelet activation and spreading (11Prasad K.S. Andre P. He M. Bao M. Manganello J. Phillips D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12367-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). CD40L–/– mice exhibit increased bleeding time (12Crow A.R. Leytin V. Starkey A.F. Rand M.L. Lazarus A.H. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and reduced thrombus stability (10Andre P. Prasad K.S. Denis C.V. He M. Papalia J.M. Hynes R.O. Phillips D.R. Wagner D.D. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), showing that the interaction between sCD40L and the integrin αIIbβ3 is physiologically relevant. Based on the above observations, we hypothesized that CD40L may bind to another still unknown receptor on human monocytes and induce cellular activation. Our results show that sCD40L binds to CD40-negative human monocytic U937 cells, an interaction that is inhibited by anti-α5β1 integrin (VLA-5) mAb as well as by soluble α5β1 integrin (sα5β1). The binding of sCD40L to immobilized purified α5β1 confirms the direct interaction of sCD40L with this integrin. sCD40L induces the translocation of α5β1 to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, the rapid activation of MAPKs ERK1/2 in U937 cells, and IL-8 gene expression, confirming the existence of a third functional receptor for CD40L on α5β1. Cells—The myelomonocytic cell line U937 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and the B cell lymphoma cell line BJAB (from Dr. J. Menezes, Sainte-Justine Hospital, Montré;al, Quebec, Canada) were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Wisent, St-Bruno, Quebec, Canada). Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant trimeric soluble CD40L (rsCD40L) (13Morris A.E. Remmele Jr., R.L. Klinke R. Macduff B.M. Fanslow W.C. Armitage R.J. J. Biol.

Alexa Fluor-488 labeling of rsCD40L (rsCD40L-A) and avidin (avidin-A) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Anti-CD40L hybridoma 5C8 (IgG2a) and anti-CD40 hybridoma G28.5 (IgG1) were obtained from the ATCC. The isotype controls anti-TSST-1 mAb 2H8 (IgG1) and anti-SEB mAb 8C12 (IgG2a) were developed in our laboratory. Anti-α5β1 mAb HA5 (IgG2b) and isotype control mouse mAb IgG2b were generously provided by Dr. Bosco Chan (Robarts Research Institute, London, Ontario, Canada). Anti-β1 mAb B44 has been previously described (14Wilkins J.A. Li A. Ni H. Stupack D.G. Shen C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3046-3051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were purchased: rabbit anti-α5 antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), anti-α5 mAb P1D6 (IgG3) (Biomeda, Foster City, CA), and isotype control IgG3 anti-bacterial peptidoglycan MAB983 (Chemicon), goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (Sigma), rabbit antiphospho-ERK1/2 and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-CD40 mAb 82102 (IgG1) (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Soluble α5β1 (sα5β1), sαVβ3, and sαVβ5 were produced as previously described (15Stupack D.G. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3729-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 16Krokhin O.V. Cheng K. Sousa S.L. Ens W. Standing K.G. Wilkins J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12950-12959Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recombinant soluble CD40-Fc was from R & D Systems. Flow Cytometric Analysis—For the rsCD40L-A binding assay, cells were incubated in binding assay medium (RPMI 1640, HEPES 10 mm, BSA 1%) containing 200 ng of rsCD40L-A or avidin-A (2 × 105 cells/100 μl) for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator and a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For competition binding with mAbs directed against cell surface molecules (CD40 and α5β1), cells (preincubated with 10 μg of human IgG/106 cells in staining medium for 15 min at 37 °C) were incubated with mAb for 30 min at 37 °C prior to labeling with rsCD40L-A. For competition binding with sα5β1 or mAbs (10-fold molar excess) directed against soluble molecules, rsCD40L-A and avidin-A were incubated with sα5β1 or mAbs for 1 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of the cells. Cell surface analyses with mAbs were performed as previously described (17Leveille C. Chandad F. Al-Daccak R. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3516-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Washed cells were analyzed on a FACSort (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). Integrin Activation—Cells (106/ml HBSS) were incubated with Mn2+ (1 mm in HBSS) or DTT (10Andre P. Prasad K.S. Denis C.V. He M. Papalia J.M. Hynes R.O. Phillips D.R. Wagner D.D. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) mm in HBSS) for 30 min at room temperature. The DTT-treated cells then were washed twice in HBSS and resuspended in HBSS. The Mn2+-stimulated cells were used without washing. Cell Binding Assay—The wells of microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorp, VWR International Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) were coated with gelatin (30 mg/ml in PBS) for 2 h at 37 °C. Unbound gelatin was removed, and the wells were air-dried for 1 h at 37 °C. Fibronectin (5 μg/ml in PBS, Chemicon) was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed with PBS and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Control wells were coated with gelatin and BSA. Cells (5 × 104 cells/well in PBS) were added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Unbound cells were removed, and the wells were washed three times with PBS under mild agitation. Bound cells were analyzed under a microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 100, Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) and photographed with a 3-CCD Color video camera, model DXC-390P (Sony Electronics Inc., Park Ridge, NJ). The images were analyzed with Northern Eclipse 6.0 software (Empix Imaging Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The adherent cells were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol. After thoroughly washing the wells with tap water, the cells were lysed with 1% SDS in water, and the absorbance at 595 nm (Thermomax microplate reader, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was determined. Solid Phase Binding Assay—The wells of microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorb) were coated with 4 μg/ml of purified sα5β1, αVβ3, αVβ5, or soluble recombinant CD40-Fc in PBS (pH 7.5, 50 μl/well) overnight at room temperature. After three washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), the wells were blocked with 0.5% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS-T, rsCD40L was added to the wells at the indicated concentration, and the plate was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. The wells were washed three times with PBS-T, and bound rsCD40L was detected using goat anti-CD40L-biotin (R & D Systems, 2 h, at room temperature) and streptavidin-HRP (Sigma, 2 h, at room temperature), and revealed with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma). Cell Stimulation—U937 and BJAB cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 4 h at 37°C and stimulated with rsCD40L (250 ng/5 × 105 cells) for 5 and 15 min at 37 °C. The stimulation was stopped by the addition of hot 2× SDS sample buffer containing 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). After boiling for 7 min, cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. Receptor Translocation to the Cytoskeleton—U937 and BJAB cells were stimulated with rsCD40L (250 ng/5 × 105 cells) for 30 min at 37 °C in binding assay medium and washed three times in PBS. Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1% Triton X-100 (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblot Analysis—Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked in BLOTTO (5% skim milk in Tris saline, pH 7.5, 0.15% Tween 20, Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated with rabbit anti-α5 antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP antibody or with mouse anti-CD40 antibody overnight at 4 °C followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was assessed by immunoblotting using phospho-specific Abs according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Membranes were stripped (62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS/100 mm, 2-mercaptoethanol, 30 min, 50 °C) and reprobed with antibody recognizing total ERK1/2. Antigen-antibody complexes were revealed with ECL (GE Healthcare, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Analysis of IL-8 mRNA Expression—U937 cells (2 × 106 cells/100 μl) were treated with 100 ng of rsCD40L in RPMI 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C for the indicated time points. Reactions were stopped by adding ice-cold RPMI, and cells were isolated by spinning at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Total RNA was prepared from each sample using the RNeasy total RNA isolation Kit (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Single strand cDNA for a PCR template was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using a primer, oligo(dT)12–18 (Invitrogen), and superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) under the conditions indicated by the manufacturer. Reverse transcription was inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min, and the products were kept on ice until needed for the PCR. Specific primers were designed from cDNA sequence for IL-8 and β-actin. Each cDNA was amplified by PCR using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The sequences of the primers were as follows: IL-8F (5′-GCCAAGGAGTGCTAAAGAAC-3′), IL-8R (5′-CACTGGCATCTTCACTGATTCTTG-3′), β-actin F (5′-AATCTGGCACCACACCTTCT-3′), and β-actin R (5′-TAATGTCACGCACGATTTCC-3′). Conditions for PCR were 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and the 72 °C for 1 min. Additional 10 min of 72 °C was performed at the end of the PCR reaction. The products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The expected sizes of the PCR products for IL-8 and β-actin were 280 and 400 bp, respectively. We did not detect any band when we performed PCR without adding the cDNA template in this study. Genomic DNA contaminants were examined by performing PCR reaction on 1 μg of total RNA at similar conditions, and no contaminants were detected. Densitometric analyses were performed on each detected band using a Molecular Imager Gel Doc System and Quantity One analysis software from Bio-Rad. Results shown are normalized for two conditions, first based on β-actin levels at each time points and thereafter, based on the level of expression of each gene of samples indicated as time 0 (non-treated samples). The ratio was then blotted as -fold increase of IL-8 mRNA after rsCD40L treatment versus time of the treatment. rsCD40L-A Bound to CD40-negative U937 Cells—In an attempt to identify a novel receptor for CD40L, we first analyzed the expression of CD40 by flow cytometry and immunoblotting using various cell lines, and selected CD40-negative cell lines that could bind Alexa Fluorlabeled rsCD40L (rsCD40L-A). The CD40-positive human BJAB B cell line was used as a control. The undifferentiated monocytic U937 cell line did not express CD40, as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A) and immunoblotting (data not shown) but was able to bind rsCD40L-A at a level similar to that observed on BJAB cells (Fig. 1B). The specificity of this binding was confirmed by adding a 10-fold molar excess of unlabeled rsCD40L (Fig. 1B) or by preincubating rsCD40L with the anti-CD40L mAb 5C8 (Fig. C). Similar results were obtained with the CD40-negative erythroleukemic K562 and HEK 293 cell lines (data not shown). Based on these results, we looked for strong evidence of rsCD40L binding to U937 cells in a CD40-independent manner. Fig. 1D shows that preincubation of U937 cells with blocking anti-CD40 mAb 82102 did not interfere with the binding of rsCD40L-A, whereas the same treatment completely prevented the binding of rsCD40L-A to BJAB cells. These results indicated that U937 cells express at least one molecule that is distinct from CD40 and that acts as a receptor for sCD40L. They also confirmed that CD40 is the sole receptor for CD40L on BJAB cells. rsCD40L Bound to α5β1—Based on the above results, and because sCD40L also binds to αIIbβ3 (10Andre P. Prasad K.S.

Blood. 2004; 104: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), hematopoietic progenitors (19Emambokus N.R. Frampton J. Immunity. 2003; 19: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and mast cells (20Oki T. Kitaura J. Eto K. Lu Y. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Inagaki N. Nagai H. Yamanishi Y. Nakajima H. Kumagai H. Kitamura T. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) but not on U937 cells (data not shown), we hypothesized that binding of rsCD40L to U937 cells may also be mediated by other members of the integrin superfamily. We first looked for integrin superfamily members that are expressed on U937, K562, and HEK 293 cells but not on BJAB cells. Among others, we found that α5β1 was expressed constitutively on U937 cells (Fig. 2A), K562 cells (data not shown) (21Ni H. Li A. Simonsen N. Wilkins J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and HEK 293 cells (data not shown) (22Lishko V.K. Yakubenko V.P. Ugarova T.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 283: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) but not on BJAB cells (Fig. 2A). To determine whether rsCD40L-A could bind to α5β1, we performed a competitive binding assay using soluble α5β1 (sα5β1) as bait for rsCD40L-A. Fig. 2B shows that preincubation of rsCD40L-A with sα5β1 substantially inhibited the binding of rsCD40L-A to U937 cells. Preincubation of rsCD40L-A with sα5β1 did not affect rsCD40L-A binding to CD40 on B cells, suggesting that sCD40L could bind concomitantly to both CD40 and α5β1. To provide further support for the notion that α5β1 is involved in the binding of rsCD40L to U937 cells, cells were preincubated with anti-α5 mAb P1D6 or isotype control mAb and then incubated with rsCD40L-A. Fig. 2C shows that mAb P1D6 inhibited the interaction of rsCD40L-A to U937 cells but, as expected, did not affect the binding of rsCD40L-A to α5β1-negative BJAB cells. Thus, the results presented here support our contention that α5β1 is the third receptor for sCD40L. Lastly, to confirm that sCD40L binds directly to α5β1, a solid phase binding assay was developed using immobilized soluble CD40-Fc as a control receptor (Fig. 3A). The results presented in Fig. 3B clearly demonstrate that rsCD40L binds directly to purified α5β1 in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, rsCD40L did not bind to other purified integrins, αVβ3 (Fig. 3C) and αVβ5 (Fig. 3D), confirming the specificity of the rsCD40L-α5β1 interaction. Thus, α5β1, like CD40 and αIIbβ3, is a receptor for sCD40L. Chemical Agents That Increase the Affinity of α5β1 for Fibronectin Negatively Affected the Binding of rsCD40L to U937 Cells—α5β1 is constitutively expressed on the cell surface in an inactive form that cannot bind fibronectin (reviewed in Ref. 23Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6814) Google Scholar). Conformational changes triggered by outside-in or inside-out signaling result in the activation of the integrin (23Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6814) Google Scholar) allowing it to bind to its natural ligand. Chemical agents such as Mn2+ and DTT can promote such changes (21Ni H. Li A. Simonsen N. Wilkins J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the activation of α5β1 integrin could also modulate the binding of rsCD40L to U937 cells. First, we confirmed that U937 cells did not constitutively bind to fibronectin and that Mn2+ and DTT strongly promoted their adhesion to fibronectin as evaluated by microscopy (Fig. 4A) and a colorimetric assay (Fig. 4B). In contrast, similar treatments of α5β1-negative BJAB cells did not promote their attachment to fibronectin (Fig. 4). Second, conformational changes induced by these chemical agents expose a β1 epitope, the mAb B44 epitope (21Ni H. Li A. Simonsen N. Wilkins J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7981-7987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Indeed, the results presented in Fig. 5A show that treatments with Mn2+ or DTT induced the expression of the B44 epitope on U937 cells but not on BJAB cells. We then assessed the binding of rsCD40L-A to U937 cells treated with Mn2+ or DTT. Interestingly, the treatment of U937 cells with Mn2+ reduced the binding of rsCD40L-A while the treatment with DTT almost completely inhibited the binding of rsCD40L-A to U937 cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, similar treatments of BJAB cells had no effect on the binding of rsCD40L-A to CD40 (Fig. 5B). Thus, changes in the conformation of α5β1 that promote its binding to fibronectin prevent its interaction with sCD40L.FIGURE 5Treating U937 cells with Mn2+ or DTT exposed the B44 β1 epitope but decreased the binding of rsCD40L to α5β1. A, effects of Mn2+ and DTT treatments of U937 and BJAB cells on B44 β1 epitope expression. Cells were treated with Mn2+ and DTT as indicated above, and the expression of the B44β1 epitope was assessed by flow cytometry. B, treatment of U937 cells with Mn2+ or DTT prevented the binding of rsCD40L-A. Cells were treated with Mn2+ or DTT as described above, and the binding of rsCD40L-A was assessed as described in Fig. 1. These results are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) rsCD40L Induced α5β1 Recruitment to the Cytoskeleton in CD40-negative U937 Cells—One consequence of the binding of β1 integrins with their ligands is their association with the cell cytoskeleton (24DeMali K.A. Wennerberg K. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). We thus looked at whether the interaction of rsCD40L with α5β1 would also result in its association with the cytoskeleton. To assess the recruitment of α5β1 to the cytoskeleton, cells were incubated with rsCD40L for 30 min at 37 °C and solubilized in Triton X-100 buffer. The soluble (Sol) and insoluble (Ins) fractions were separated by centrifugation and analyzed by immunoblotting with a rabbit polyclonal anti-α5 Ab (Fig. 6A). α5β1 was found exclusively in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction of unstimulated U937 cells, whereas a significant amount of α5β1 translocated into the Triton-X-100-insoluble fraction of rsCD40L-stimulated U937 cells. As expected, rsCD40L induced the translocation of CD40 to the detergentinsoluble fraction of BJAB B cells (25Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and the formation of CD40 homodimers (26Reyes-Moreno C. Girouard J. Lapointe R. Darveau A. Mourad W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7799-7806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). Thus, like its natural ligand, fibronectin, the interaction of rsCD40L with α5β1 triggered its association with the cytoskeleton. rsCD40L Induced the Activation of the ERK1/2 Pathway in CD40-negative U937 Cells—The above results prompted us to investigate signal-transducing events triggered by the engagement of α5β1 by rsCD40L. The stimulation of monocytes with membrane CD40L or sCD40L induces the activation of the MAPK pathways ERK1 and -2 (27Suttles J. Milhorn D.M. Miller R.W. Poe J.C. Wahl L.M. Stout R.D. J. Biol.

J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2147-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The binding of ligand to α5β1 also induces the activation of MAPK pathways (30de Fougerolles A.R. Koteliansky V.E. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 208-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in U937 cells following stimulation with rsCD40L and found, as shown in Fig. 7A, that ERK1/2 was rapidly phosphorylated in rsCD40L-activated U937 cells. As expected (31Grammer A.C. Fischer R. Lee O. Zhang X. Lipsky P.E. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2004; 6: 28-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rsCD40L induced the activation of ERK1/2 in BJAB cells (Fig. 7A). These results indicated that, like its classic ligand fibronectin, the interaction of sCD40L with α5β1 triggers the activation of signaling pathways, confirming the functional status of this interaction. Interaction between sα5β1 and rsCD40L Did Not Interfere with the CD40L-induced Activation of ERK1/2 via CD40—We showed above by flow cytometry analysis that purified sα5β1 prevented the interaction of rsCD40L with U937 cells.

https://openalex.org/W1986301417,"The Atf1 transcription factor plays a vital role in the ability of Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells to respond to various stress conditions. It regulates the expression of many genes in a stress-dependent manner, and its function is dependent upon the stress-activated MAPK, Sty1/Spc1. Moreover, Atf1 is directly phosphorylated by Sty1. Here we have investigated the role of such phosphorylation. Atf1 protein accumulates following stress, and this accumulation is lost in a strain defective in the Sty1 signaling pathway. In addition, accumulation of a mutant Atf1 protein that can no longer be phosphorylated is lost. Measurement of the half-life of Atf1 demonstrates that changes in Atf1 stability are responsible for this accumulation. Atf1 stability is also regulated by its heterodimeric partner, Pcr1. Similarly, Pcr1 levels are regulated by Atf1. Thus multiple pathways exist that ensure that Atf1 levels are appropriately regulated. Phosphorylation of Atf1 is important for cells to mount a robust response to H2O2 stress, because the Atf1 phospho-mutant displays sensitivity to this stress, and induction of gene expression is lower than that observed in wild-type cells. Surprisingly, however, loss of Atf1 phosphorylation does not lead to the complete loss of stress-activated expression of Atf1 target genes. Accordingly, the Atf1 phospho-mutant does not display the same overall stress sensitivities as the atf1 deletion mutant. Taken together, these data suggest that Sty1 phosphorylation of Atf1 is not required for activation of Atf1 per se but rather for modulating its stability.

Eukaryotic cells have developed response mechanisms to combat the harmful effects of a variety of stress conditions. In the majority of cases, such responses involve changes in the gene expression pattern of the cell, leading to increased levels and activities of proteins that have stress-protective functions. Central to these responses are the sensing and signaling pathways that communicate with the nucleus and facilitate necessary changes in gene expression. Of particular importance are the pathways collectively known as MAPK 5The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; MM, minimal medium. pathways (1Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). The best characterized of these is a mammalian pathway that activates ERK1 and ERK2 in response to a variety of growth factors and mitogens and has been shown to be involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation (2Waskiewicz A.J.

Another subset of the MAPK pathways within a cell, the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), responds to stress. In mammalian cells, two such pathways exist that lead to the activation of the JNK and p38 kinases (2Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin.

A number of transcription factors are phosphorylated in response to SAPK activation, examples being c-Jun, which is regulated by JNK, and ATF2, which can be regulated by both JNK and p38 (4Hibi M.

In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a single member of the SAPK family called Sty1/Spc1/Phh1 (hereafter referred to as Sty1) has been identified (9Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 10Millar J.B. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 11Kato Jr., T. Okazaki K. Murakami H. Stettler S. Fantes P.A. Okayama H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The Sty1 MAPK stimulates gene expression via the Atf1 transcription factor, which is similar to the human ATF2 factor, and binds to closely related DNA sequences (12Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 13Wilkinson M.G. Samuels M. Takeda T. Toone W.M. Shieh J.C. Toda T. Millar J.B. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2289-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Thus, the transcription factor targets of the S. pombe pathway are closely related to a subset of those phosphorylated and regulated by SAPKs in mammalian cells. The Atf1 factor was identified independently through the S. pombe DNA-sequencing project, by a genetic screen for sterile mutants that demonstrated a defect in G1 arrest following nitrogen starvation and through a genetic screen for genes that could suppress the mating defect of sty1– cells (12Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 14Takeda T. Toda T. Kominami K. Kohnosu A. Yanagida M. Jones N.

Atf1 binds to its cognate site together with a second basic-leucine zipper (b-ZIP) containing protein Pcr1 (16Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 704-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the heterodimer has a significantly higher binding affinity than either homodimer complex (17Kon N. Krawchuk M.D. Warren B.G. Smith G.R. Wahls W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13765-13770Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Disruption of the atf1 gene results in a range of phenotypes, including defects in sexual differentiation and maintenance of viability in stationary phase and sensitivity to osmotic stress and oxidative stress (14Takeda T. Toda T. Kominami K. Kohnosu A. Yanagida M. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6193-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 15Kanoh J. Watanabe Y. Ohsugi M. Iino Y. Yamamoto M.

Cell. 2002; 13: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus Atf1 is crucial for fission yeast cells to respond normally to a range of different stress conditions. Previous studies have shown that stress-induced activation of Sty1 results in its translocation to the nucleus whereby it binds to, and phosphorylates, Atf1 (21Gaits F. Degols G. Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1464-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the observation that the expression of Atf1 target genes requires Sty1 activation, strongly suggested that phosphorylation of Atf1 stimulates its activity. However, the mechanism by which this regulation might occur is not known. In mammalian cells, regulation of ATF2 by JNK or p38-induced phosphorylation has been investigated in detail. Regulation appears to be exercised at a number of different levels. In the absence of stimulating conditions, ATF2 is transcriptionally inactive due to an intramolecular interaction between the DNA binding domain and the amino-terminal region. It has been suggested that this intramolecular inhibition is disrupted, and transcriptional activities restored, when ATF2 interacts with other proteins, such as E1A or c-Jun, or when it is phosphorylated by SAPKs (22Li X.Y. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation has also been shown to increase the activity of the isolated transactivation domain of ATF2, although the mechanism involved remains obscure (6Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 8van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 23Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Yet another mode of regulation involves ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the 26 S proteasome; phosphorylation of ATF2 by SAPKs appears to protect it from ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (24Firestein R. Feuerstein N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5892-5902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12560-12564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to investigate how Atf1 may be regulated through Sty1-mediated phosphorylation. Our results indicate that phosphorylation regulates the stability of Atf1 as does heterodimerization with its binding partner Pcr1. This regulation, however, appears to be only partly responsible for the role of Sty1 in stimulating Atf1-dependent gene expression suggesting that at least one other mode of control must exist that does not involve direct Atf1 phosphorylation. Yeast Strains and General Methods—S. pombe strains used are listed in Table 1. Yeast media and general experimental methods were as described (27Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). For the dilution assays, exponentially growing cells at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml were diluted 5-fold a total of four times, and 7.5 μl of each dilution, including the starting dilution of 1 × 106 cells/ml, was plated on yeast extract plates containing various stress-inducing agents.TABLE 1S. pombe strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceNJ2h-ura4-D18 leu1-32 ade6-M210 his7-366C.

This procedure did not lead to activation of Sty1 (data not shown). A previous study has also shown that mild centrifugation for 2 min at 800 relative centrifugal force did not lead to a difference in the profile of gene expression compared with that obtained from cells isolated by filtration (28Lyne R. Burns G. Mata J. Penkett C.J. Rustici G. Chen D. Langford C. Vetrie D. Baöhler J. BMC Genomics. 2003; 4: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), consistent with our finding that mild centrifugation does not activate the stress-activated MAPK pathway in fission yeast. Cycloheximide (Sigma C4859) was added to cultures at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml to inhibit protein synthesis. Creation of an atf1-11M Allele and Integration—The atf1 cDNA was cloned into the pREP81 vector (29Basi G. Schmid E. Maundrell K. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) with two hemagglutinin epitopes and six histidine residues placed at the carboxyl terminus of the open reading frame (ORF). Point mutations were introduced into pREP81(atf1+) by a PCR-based method. Serines at positions 2, 4, 140, 152, 172, 226, and 438 and threonine at position 77 were replaced by alanine, and threonines at positions 204, 216, and 249 were replaced by isoleucine (pREP81(atf1-11M)). For atf1+, a 1.4-kb EcoRI fragment, which encompassed the carboxyl-terminal region of the atf1 cDNA and the nmt1 terminator region, was subcloned into the YIplac128 vector (30Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar). The vector was linearized with MscI, and the resulting fragment was transformed into a wild-type strain (NJ2). Stable leu+ clones were selected, and integration and copy number were determined by PCR and Southern blotting, respectively. This strain expressing the tagged version of Atf1 was indistinguishable from one expressing untagged Atf1. For atf1-11M, a 1.2-kb fragment upstream of the atf1 coding region was PCR-amplified, ligated to the atf1-11M ORF, and inserted into YIplac128 with the nmt1 terminator region cloned downstream. The plasmid was digested at a unique StuI site and transformed into the S. pombe atf1/gad7 disruptant (JX305) (15Kanoh J. Watanabe Y. Ohsugi M. Iino Y. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 391-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Integrated clones were assessed as above. Protein Extract Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—Native S. pombe cell extracts were prepared by glass bead lysis in the following buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.15 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protein inhibitor Complete™ (Roche Applied Science). Before lysis, cells were washed once in stop buffer (150 ml of NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, pH8). Total cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P™ (Millipore) or nitrocellulose. For the analysis of Atf1, 8% gels were prepared. Pcr1 was detected after extracts had been separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. Polyclonal anti-Atf1 and anti-Pcr1 antisera were obtained by immunizing rabbits with GST-Atf1 or GST-Pcr1. Anti-Atf1 and Anti-Pcr1 antisera were purified using antigen-spotted membranes and used at dilutions of 1 in 750 and 1 in 500, respectively. Anti-tubulin antiserum was obtained from Sigma (T5168) and used at a dilution of 1 in 1000, Mts4 antiserum (49Wilkinson C.R. Wallace M. Seeger M. Dubiel W. Gordon C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25768-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used at a dilution of 1 in 5000, and a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5) obtained from Roche Applied Science was used at a dilution of 1 in 1000. Detection was performed using a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences Pharmacia) and chemiluminescence visualization (ECL+, Amersham Biosciences) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunoprecipitations were carried out using an anti-hemagglutinin matrix (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Phosphatase analysis was carried out using λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C. Quantification of Western blot signals was performed using the Chemi Genius Bioimaging system (Syngene) and the Chemi genius gel documentation and analysis system. Denatured S. pombe extracts were prepared using the following method. A volume corresponding to A600 nm 0.5–3.0 of cells was harvested and resuspended by vortexing in 1 ml of 0.3 m NaOH. 150 μl of 55% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid was added; the mixture was vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cells were pelleted at 4 °C for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was removed by aspiration, and the cells were spun briefly for a second time to remove remaining trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was resuspended in 75 μl of SDS gel-loading buffer per A600 nm of cells (SDS gel loading buffer: 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS (w/w), 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were denatured for 10 min at 100 °C. Samples were centrifuged briefly, before loading onto SDS-PAGE gels. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Total cellular protein was prepared from NJ2, NJ71, and NJ72. 14 mg of whole cell protein was used in immunoprecipitation reactions. After the final wash the matrix was resuspended in two-dimensional gel sample buffer (8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.002% bromphenol blue) and subjected to isoelectric focusing using 7-cm strips pH 4–7 (Amersham Biosciences) and the IPGphor (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Isoelectric focusing steps were as follows: rehydration for 16 h; 5000 V for 1 h, 4000 V for 1 h 30 min, and then 5000 V for 2 h. The second dimension was separated by SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel. RNA Analysis—10-μg samples of total RNA isolated at the time points indicated in the figures were denatured with formaldehyde, separated on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Probes for RNA-DNA hybridization were PCR-generated fragments internal to the gene concerned and labeled with 32P by use of a DNA Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). atf1 and atf1-11M mRNA levels were quantified relative to the hmg1 transcript using the Chemi genius system. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—The chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure is based on the methods described elsewhere (31Hecht A. Strahl-Bolsinger S. Grunstein M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 469-479PubMed Google Scholar, 32Tanaka T. Kanpp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) with some modifications. All steps were performed on ice except when indicated. 100 ml of yeast cells A595 = 0.6 were cross-linked for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde at 24 °C. After addition of 125 mm glycine and incubation for 5 min at 24 °C, cells were chilled on ice, washed with ice-cold dH2O, and suspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, Complete™ protease inhibitor EDTA free (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm EDTA). Crude extracts were prepared by 3–4 pulses (15 s at level 5) of bead beating in a FastPrep FP120 Ribolyzer (Thermo Savant, Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA) until 70–80% of cells were broken. Extracts were sonicated four times for 10 s (level 5) using a Soniprep 150 (Sanyo) until chromatin was sheared to an average size of 500 bp and subsequently cleared of insoluble cell debris by short centrifugation at full speed. 5 μl of the whole cell extract was saved as an INPUT control. Immunoprecipitation was performed for 3–4 h with Dynal protein A-coated magnetic beads, which were previously incubated overnight with anti Atf1 antiserum. Precipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, 1 ml of lysis buffer plus salt (like lysis buffer, except 500 mm NaCl), and 1 ml of wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA), respectively. Precipitates were eluted by 10 min of incubation at 65 °C in 40 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). Eluates were incubated at 65 °C in a total volume of 150 μl (100 μl for INPUT control) elution buffer containing RNase (0.1 mg/ml) for overnight, then doubled in volume with TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA), 0.1 mg/ml glycogen, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit. We used standard PCR (data not shown) as well as real-time PCR, to quantify for each immunoprecipitate the relative amount of DNA corresponding to stress-induced (gpd1 and hsp9) or stress-independent (act1) over the stress-independent promoter (cdc2). The ORF of the stress-independent pol1 gene was used as an additional background control. Primers used relative to the transcription start codon corresponded to –214 to –193 and –168 to –149 for the cdc2 promoter; –402 to –380 and –360 to –340 for the gpd1 promoter; –264 to –245 and –220 to –199 for the hsp9 promoter; –113 to –85 and –61 to –34 for the act1 promoter; and +2520 to +2543 and +2567 to +2588 for the pol1 ORF. For real-time PCR we set up 12.5-μl reactions containing 0.5 μl of purified DNA from a particular immunoprecipitate, 1 μl of 5 μm 5′-oligonucleotide primer, 1 μl of 5 μm 3′-oligonucleotide primer, 6.25 μl of SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), and 3.75 μlof dH20. Reactions were analyzed using an ABI 7900 thermal cycler according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We performed three independent PCR reactions and calculated the mean “threshold cycle number” (or Ct value). The -fold enrichment of the stress-inducible promoters relative to stress-independent promoters for a particular sample was calculated using the following formula: -fold enrichment = 2CtINPUT – CtIP/2CtINPUT – Ctbackground, where Ct IP is the Ct value for the immunoprecipitate (gpd1, hsp9, act1, and pol1), and Ct background is the Ct value for the background control (cdc2). Atf1 Protein Accumulates following Stress—The Atf1 protein possesses eleven potential MAPK sites, namely a serine or threonine residue immediately followed by a proline (Fig. 1A). We first examined the levels of Atf1 protein before and after two different types of stress, namely oxidative stress (H2O2) and osmotic stress (sorbitol) to determine whether, by analogy to the mammalian ATF2 factor, phosphorylation modulated Atf1 stability (24Firestein R. Feuerstein N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5892-5902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Fuchs S.Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3289-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Fuchs S.Y. Tappin I. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12560-12564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells the level of Atf1 was significantly increased following stress imposition (Fig. 1B). In addition to increased levels, the mobility of the Atf1 protein was retarded; this has been shown previously to be due to phosphorylation (12Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 16Watanabe Y. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 704-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the possibility that stability of Atf1 is linked to its phosphorylation state. Interestingly, the extent and kinetics of phosphorylation appear to be dependent on the particular type of stress applied. To directly test whether phosphorylation affects stability, we constructed a mutant atf1 gene containing single point mutations in all potential MAPK phosphoacceptor sites (atf1-11M). This gene was integrated into the atf1 locus so that atf1 mRNA expression was under the control of the endogenous promoter. Following the imposition of stress, neither retardation nor significant accumulation of the mutant atf1-11M protein was observed (Fig. 1B). The results are consistent with a lack of phosphorylation of the mutant protein and a dependence on direct phosphorylation for Atf1 accumulation. There was a slight reduction in the amount of mRNA produced for the atf1-11M transcript compared with wild-type (Fig. 1C), but the levels did not seem to drop sufficiently enough to explain the dramatic decrease that we observed in the level of atf1-11M protein. A slight increase in the amount of atf1-11M protein over time was observed (Fig. 1B, compare levels at t = 0 to t = 30) and was probably due to a modest increase in the atf1 mRNA levels that we observed upon stress (Fig. 1C) (12Shiozaki K. Russell P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 33Rodriguez-Gabriel M.A. Burns G. McDonald W.H. Martin V. Yates 3rd, J.R. Baöhler J. Russell P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6256-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Previously, we have analyzed the global changes in gene expression in response to stress and found that, in H2O2 stress, the levels of atf1 mRNA are induced 2.3- and 2.7-fold at 15 and 60 min of stress, respectively; in response to sorbitol stress the levels of atf1 mRNA are induced 2.6-fold at 15 min and have returned to basal levels by 60 min (34Chen D. Toone W.M. Mata J. Lyne R. Burns G. Kivinen K. Brazma A. Jones N. Baöhler J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 214-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). These modest increases are in agreement with our Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1C). To support the above conclusions, we examined Atf1 protein levels in different mutant backgrounds defective, or containing a constitutively active, Sty1 kinase pathway. Wis1 is an MAPK kinase that phosphorylates and thus activates Sty1. In both sty1Δ and wis1Δ cells, the level of Atf1 in the absence of stress was lower than in wild-type cells (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, no increase in levels and no retardation of mobility were observed following H2O2 stress. In contrast, however, in wis1-DD cells, which have a constitutively active allele of the MAPK kinase wis1 (35Shiozaki K. Shiozaki M. Russell P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), Atf1 levels were high in the absence of stress and a significant proportion had a retarded mobility. The levels did not increase further following stress. Thus all the results described above show a tight correlation between the phosphorylation of Atf1 and its level in the cell. Atf1 Is Phosphorylated under Basal and Stress Conditions but Not When Its MAPK Sites Are Mutated—Although all the potential MAPK sites in Atf1 had been mutated, it was important to examine the phosphorylation status of atf1-11M, because it was possible that Sty1 could still phosphorylate a site that did not conform to the MAPK consensus motif. A previous study has shown that the mammalian homologue of Sty1, p38α, can phosphorylate one of its targets, TAB1, at a serine-alanine site that does not fit the MAPK consensus motif (36Cheung P.C. Campbell D.G. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5793-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Firstly, we stressed atf1-HA and atf1-11M-HA cells and analyzed the Atf1 protein from these and unstressed control samples. The immunoprecipitated protein fractions were split into two, and one-half of each sample was treated with λ-phosphatase to remove the phosphate groups and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the Atf1 protein growing in rich media without stress appeared to be basally phosphorylated. Upon stress, as expected, Atf1 became hyperphosphorylated.

Prolonged hypertrophy often leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Upstream endogenous regulators of class II HDACs that regulate hypertrophic growth are just beginning to emerge. HerewedemonstratethattheδBisoformofcalcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIδB), known to promote cardiac hypertrophy, transmits signals specifically to HDAC4 but not other class II HDACs. CaMKIIδB efficiently phosphorylates both a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HDAC4 fragment spanning amino acids 207–311 and full-length FLAG-HDAC4 but not the equivalents in HDAC5. Although previous studies in skeletal muscle cells have shown that HDAC4 lacking serine 246 cannot be phosphorylated by CaMKI/IV, a similar mutant is still phosphorylated by CaMKIIδB. Importantly, mutation of serine 210 to alanine totally abolishes phosphorylation of the GST fragment and significantly reduces phosphorylation of full-length HDAC by CaMKIIδB. RNA interference knockdown of CaMKIIδB prevents the effects of hypertrophic stimuli. Overexpression of CaMKIIδB in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes increases the activity of the Mef2 transcription factor and completely rescues HDAC4-mediated repression of MEF2 but only partially rescues inhibition by HDAC5 or the HDAC4 S210A mutant. CaMKIIδB strongly interacts with HDAC4 in cells but not with HDAC5. These results demonstrate that CaMKIIδB preferentially targets HDAC4, and this involves serine 210. These findings identify HDAC4 as a specific downstream substrate of CaMKIIδB in cardiac cells and have broad applications for the signaling pathways leading to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

Histone acetylation and deacetylation represent a central mechanism in the control of gene expression (1Kuo M.H. Allis C.D.

Three classes of HDACs have been isolated and differ according to their structure, complex formation, and expression pattern (3Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 3-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Class II HDACs (-4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -10) are expressed abundantly in heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, the same tissues that express high levels of the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) family of transcriptional activators. In skeletal muscle cells, association of class II HDACs with Mef2 results in repression of Mef2 activity and inhibition of myogenesis (4Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This effect is mediated by interaction of MEF2 with the N-terminal region of class II HDACs that contains two conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of these sites by CaMKI or -IV recruits the chaperone protein 14-3-3, which results in the nuclear export of HDAC/14-3-3 complexes (5Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

CaMKs are serine/threonine kinases regulated by calcium and calmodulin. Activation of CaMK signaling plays a role in cardiac diseases such as hypertrophic growth (see Ref. 10Zhang T. Brown J.H. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar for review). CaMKIV, although not expressed in the myocardium, can enter the nucleus, and mice expressing high levels of this kinase develop a profound hypertrophy (11Passier R. Zeng H. Frey N. Naya F.J.

CaMKII is the major isoform expressed in heart muscle and exists as a homo- or heteromultimer of 8–12 subunits derived from four genes, α, β, γ, and δ (for reviews, see Refs. 12Frey N. McKinsey T.A.

The δ subunit of CaMKII predominates in the adult heart (15Edman C.F. Schulman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 16Baltas L.G. Karczewski P.

Hoch B. Krause E.G. Karczewski P. J. Cell Biochem. 1999; 74: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). CaMKIIδ isoforms are highly homologous with the exception of a variable domain generated by alternative splicing. The δB isoform contains an 11-amino acid nuclear localization signal (19Brocke L. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), allowing expression of the kinase in the nucleus of cardiac cells. Thus, heteromultimers with a majority of δB subunits localize to the nucleus and are expected to regulate transcriptional events in heart muscle. So far CaMKIIδB has been shown to regulate transcription through one effect, the induction of the atrial natriuretic factor, which requires the nuclear localization signal of the kinase (21Ramirez M.T. Zhao X.L. Schulman H. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31203-31208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recent studies have linked the δB subunit of CaMKII to cardiac hypertrophy, because transgenic mice expressing high levels of the kinase develop hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy (22Zhang T.

Res. 2003; 92: 912-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The details of the pathways involved remain to be determined. In heart muscle class II HDACs act as repressors of cardiac hypertrophy (see Ref. 24McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar for review), an adaptative response of the heart to various pathological stimuli characterized by an increase in cell size and reprogramming of fetal cardiac genes (see Ref. 25McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar for review). Although initially beneficial, prolonged hypertrophy often leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Forced expression of HDAC5 and -9 prevents agonist-mediated hypertrophy in isolated cardiomyocytes (26Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), and mutant mice lacking HDAC5 and -9 are hypersensitive to hypertrophic stimuli and develop severe hypertrophic growth (26Zhang C.L.

Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8467-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Hypertrophy mediated by phenylephrine treatment leads to an increase in Mef2 activity through a post-translational mechanism mediated by CaMK signaling (28Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Activation of CaMKI and -IV promotes the phosphorylation of two conserved serines at the N-terminal of class II HDACs, Ser-246/467 in HDAC4, Ser-259/498 in HDAC5, and Ser-218/448 in HDAC9. Mutant HDACs lacking the conserved serines are resistant to hypertrophic signals and prevent myocardiocyte hypertrophy (26Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Protein kinases C and D1 also phosphorylate HDAC5 and regulate cardiac stress signaling (29Harrison B.C. Kim M.S. van Rooij E. Plato C.F. Papst P.J. Vega R.B. McAnally J.A. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. McKinsey T.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 3875-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 30Vega R.B. Harrison B.C. Meadows E. Roberts C.R. Papst P.J. Olson E.N. McKinsey T.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 8374-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of class II HDACs provides a mechanism to connect extracellular stimuli to the genome. However, CaMKI and -IV are expressed at very low levels or not expressed at all in heart muscle, and the cardiac endogenous CaMK(s) responsible for these events has yet to be identified. HDAC4, -5, and -9 are all substrates of CaMKI and -IV in non-cardiac cells. Here, we report the unsuspected finding that nuclear CaMKIIδB transmits signals through phosphorylation specifically to HDAC4. A GST-HDAC4 fragment spanning amino acids 207–311 is heavily phosphorylated by CaMKIIδB but not the equivalent fragment in HDAC5 or -9. Importantly, full-length HDAC4 but not HDAC5 is a substrate for CaMKIIδB. Although an HDAC4 mutant lacking serine 246 cannot be phosphorylated by CaMKI and -IV, we find that such a mutant is still highly phosphorylated by the δB subunit of CaMKII. We discovered a novel site in HDAC4 that confers responsiveness to CaMKIIδB. Mutation of serine 210 to alanine in GST-HDAC4-(207–311) totally abolishes phosphorylation by CaMKIIδB and substitution of Ser-210 with alanine in full-length HDAC4 (HDAC4-S210A) impairs phosphorylation by CaMKIIδB. We also demonstrate that HDAC4, but not HDAC5, strongly interacts with CaMKIIδB in cells. Furthermore, in the presence of the kinase, HDAC4 minimally affects Mef2 activity in primary cardiomyocytes, whereas HDAC4-S210A and HDAC5 have a strong repressive effect. We demonstrate that specific knockdown of CaMKIIδB by siRNA inhibits Mef2 activity in primary cardiomyocytes and prevents the effect of hypertrophic stimuli. These findings demonstrate that HDAC4 is a specific substrate for CaMKIIδB in cardiac cells and have broad applications for mechanisms of transcriptional repression and for pathways involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Plasmids, Inhibitors, and Antibodies—The 3×Mef2-luciferase reporter construct has been described previously (31Poizat C. Puri P.L. Bai Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2673-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). SRα empty plasmid and SRα-CaMKIIδB were gifts from Joan Heller-Brown (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA) and Howard Schulman (Stanford University). Constitutively active forms of CaMKIIδB (CaMKIIδB-T287D, CaMKIIδB-T287D/S332A, and CaMKIIδB-T287D/S332–335A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The construct Gal-Mef2C-(1–465), GST-HDAC fusion proteins, and GST-HDAC fusion proteins in which Ser-246 for HDAC4, Ser-259 for HDAC5, and Ser-218 for HDAC9 are mutated to Ala (26Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) were gifts from Eric Olson (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). GST-HDAC4 mutants with serines 209, 210, 219, 222, 223, 278, 288, 290, 293, 306, 307, 309, and 311 mutated to Ala were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and were expressed as recombinant proteins in DH5α bacterial cells. Mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing. Full-length HDAC4 and -5 plasmids carrying the FLAG epitope were generously provided by Stuart Schreiber (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). Full-length HDAC4 with Ser-210 mutated to alanine was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The presence of the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. 14-3-3ε was a generous gift from Stuart Schreiber (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). KN-93 CaMKII inhibitor and the KN-92 inactive analogue were purchased from Calbiochem. FLAG antibody (M2) and HA-affinity gel were from Sigma. HA (F-7 monoclonal or Y-11 polyclonal), GAPDH (V-18 goat polyclonal), GFP (FL polyclonal), GST (Z-5), and c-Myc (A-14) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). α-Actinin antibody (mouse monoclonal) was from Sigma, and ANF antibody (polyclonal) was from Bachem. Generation of Adeno-CaMKIIδB and Adeno-CaMKIIδB-T287D—Adenoviruses expressing wild-type CaMKIIδB and active CaMKIIδB-T287D were generated using the AdEASY Vector System as described in a previous study (32Iso T. Sartorelli V. Chung G. Shichinohe T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, each cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pAdTrack-CMV vector. The HA tag sequence was kept at the N terminus of both proteins. pAdTrack-CMV vectors bearing CaMKIIδB or CaMKIIδB-T287D cDNA were first linearized with PmeI, and then, together with adenoviral backbone vector pAdEasy, introduced into Escherichia coli strain BJ5183. Recombinant adenoviral plasmids were recovered and introduced into 293A cells by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The recombinant viruses (Ad-CaMKIIδB and Ad-CaMKIIδB-T287D) were propagated in 293A cells and recovered after several freezing/thawing cycles. After filtration through 45-μm filters, the virus titer was measured by serial dilution and counting the number of GFP-positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Expression of GST-HDACs in Bacteria—GST and GST-HDACs, wild type and with serine to alanine mutations, were expressed in bacteria as described previously (33Smith D.B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 16.7.1-16.7.6Google Scholar). Equal amounts of fusion proteins were used in each phosphorylation assay. In Vitro Phosphorylation of GST-HDACs by CaMKIIδB—CaMKIIδB-T287D was purified from HeLa cells infected with Ad-CaMKIIδB-T287D using EZ-view Red HA-affinity gel following the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Phosphorylation of GST-HDAC recombinant proteins was performed in a kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2) in the presence of calmodulin (40 μg/ml) and [γ-32P]ATP (5 mCi/ml). GST-HDACs were added to 0.5 μg of CaMKIIδB-T287D bound to HA-agarose. In vitro kinase assays were also performed with concentrations of CaMKIIδB ranging from 5 to 100 ng and supplemented with 12.5 μm ATP. Concentration of the kinase was calculated by running aliquots on 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen) alongside bovine serum albumin standards. Reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min and stopped by addition of loading buffer. The reactions were then resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels. After Coomassie staining, the gels were dried onto filter paper and analyzed by autoradiography. Phosphorylation was quantified by densitometry using a Storm scanner and ImageQuant software. GST-HDAC fusion proteins were also detected by Western blot with an anti-GST antibody on aliquots of the substrate to demonstrate equal loading. Phosphorylation of Full-length HDACs—COS7 cells were transfected with full-length FLAG-HDAC4, FLAG-HDAC4-S210A, FLAG-HDAC5, or HA-CaMKIIδB-T287D using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Total cell extracts were prepared as previously described (31Poizat C. Puri P.L. Bai Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2673-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1%Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for HDACs and in buffer containing 200 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% TX-100, 500 mm NaCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture for CaMK. HDACs were purified using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) and CaMKIIδB-T287D using EZ-view Red anti-HA affinity gel (Sigma). HDACs were eluted using 100 mm glycine, pH 3.5, neutralized by addition of a one-tenth volume of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and added to 0.5 μg of CaMKIIδB-T287D still bound to the HA affinity gel. Kinase reactions were also performed with limiting (5–100 ng) amounts of enzyme. Phosphorylation reactions were performed as described for GST-HDACs except that labeled proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and Western blot analysis was performed to verify equal loading of each HDAC and the kinase. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—COS7 cells were co-transfected with full-length FLAG-HDAC4, FLAG-HDAC4-S210A, or FLAG-HDAC5 plus CaMKIIδBor CaMKIIδB-T287D carrying an HA epitope using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). When indicated, the cells were transfected with Myc-tagged 14-3-3ε. Total cell extracts were prepared as previously described (31Poizat C. Puri P.L. Bai Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2673-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm or 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). HDAC4, HDAC4-S210A, HDAC5, CaMKIIδB, and 14-3-3ε protein levels were determined by direct Western blot analysis of 2.5% of the total cell extract using anti-FLAG M2, anti-HA, or anti-Myc antibody. Class II HDACs were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) from the remaining cell extract and washed in the cell lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted using 100 mm glycine, pH 3.5, and separated on 4–12% NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen). After transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), Western blot analysis was performed with the anti-HA antibody to detect interaction with CaMKIIδB, and with the anti-Myc antibody to detect binding with 14-3-3. Isolation and Transfection of Primary Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes—Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes from 2- to 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared as previously described (31Poizat C. Puri P.L. Bai Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2673-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation using the BES-buffered saline protocol as described before (31Poizat C. Puri P.L. Bai Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2673-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or using Lipofectamine 200 (Invitrogen). Cardiomyocytes were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well and transfected with the indicated plasmids. Total DNA was maintained constant between wells. 48 h after transfection, total cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured with a Victor luminometer. Cardiomyocytes treated with the CaMKII inhibitors were first transfected with the G5E1b-luciferase reporter. 24 h after transfection, the media was changed and the cells were maintained in media supplemented with 2 μm of KN-93 or 2 μm of its inactive analogue KN-92 for 24 h. Total cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured as described previously. For studies involving cardiac hypertrophy, primary cardiomyocytes were isolated as described earlier, and, 24 h after plating, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium before stimulation with phenylephrine (PE, 10 μm) or fetal bovine serum (10%). Immunofluorescence Studies—Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (31Poizat C. Puri P.L. Bai Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2673-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary neonatal cardiomyocytes were plated on coverslides in 6-well dishes. Cells were transfected with CaMKIIδB-T287D or CaMKIIδB-T287D/S332A. For adenoviral infection, cardiomyocytes were infected with a control Ad-GFP or Ad-CaMKIIδB-shRNA at identical titers. 12 h later, the culture medium was changed to serum-free medium for several hours followed by addition of PE or fetal bovine serum. COS7 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-HDAC4, FLAG-HDAC5, or FLAG-HDAC4-S210A in the presence or absence of Myc-tagged 14-3-3ε, HA-CaMKIIδB-T287D, or both. The same experiment was also performed with wild-type CaMKIIδB. 48 h later the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% formalin. After permeabilization with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with (0.5%) Nonidet P-40, the slides were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated with the same solution containing the primary antibody recognizing the HA probe (dilution 1:100), α-actinin (dilution 1:100), or the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF, dilution 1:200). Secondary reactions were performed with a secondary antibody conjugated with TRITC or Cy3. The coverslides were mounted with Vectashield mounting media containing 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). Signals were observed by confocal microscopy with a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM 510) or an Olympus confocal microscope. siRNA Preparation and Transfection—To design target-specific siRNA duplexes against the δB isoform of CaMKII, we selected sequences of the type AA(N19) (N, any nucleotide) from the open reading frame of rat CaMKIIδB mRNA. We obtained a 21-nucleotide sense and antisense strand with symmetric 2-nucleotide 3′-overhangs of identical sequences. The target sequence from rat CaMKIIδB (sense siRNA: 5′-GUUCGAGUGUUCAGAUGAUdTdT-3′) was utilized and was submitted to a BLAST search to ensure that only this isoform of CaMKII was targeted. A scramble oligoribonucleotide duplex that was not homologous to any mammalian genes was utilized as the control (sense siRNA: 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3′). siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). Transient transfections of siRNAs in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Primary cardiomyocytes were transfected with a 3×Mef2-luciferase reporter or the G5E1b-luciferase reporter and siRNA directed against CaMKIIδB or control siRNA. Luciferase activity was measured 72 h later in cell extracts. Specific silencing was confirmed by Western blot analysis and by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. For the generation of Ad-CaMKIIδB shRNA, a small DNA insert consisting of 72 bp in length that encodes a short hairpin targeting CaMKIIδB was cloned into the pRNATH1.1/Adeno vector (Genscript) at the MluI and XhoI sites. The vector contains a GFP marker under the control of the CMV promoter. The pRNATH1.1/Adeno-CaMKIIδB vector was linearized and recombined with BJ183-AD-1 cells (Stratagene). Recombinant adenoviral DNA was transfected into 293A cells to generate and amplify Ad-CaMKIIδB shRNA virus. Virus titer was measured by serial dilution and by counting the number of GFP-positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Primary cardiomyocytes were transfected with CaMKIIδB siRNA or control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (31Poizat C. Puri P.L. Bai Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 2673-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After reverse transcription of total RNA using the RETROscript kit (Ambion), endogenous CaMKIIδB mRNA levels were measured by PCR with CaMKIIδB-specific primers in a reaction containing [32P]dCTP. GAPDH was used as the loading control. PCR products were separated on 5% acrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. CaMKIIδB Selectively Phosphorylates GST-HDAC4-(207–311) but Not the Equivalent Fragments in HDAC5 or HDAC9—In skeletal muscle cells CaMKI and -IV phosphorylate and induce the nuclear export of HDAC4 and -5, which results in the activation of MEF2 and stimulation of myogenesis (9McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Shuttling of these HDACs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is mediated by the phosphorylation of two regulatory serines conserved in HDAC4, -5, and -9 (Ser-246 and -467 in HDAC4, Ser-259 and -498 in HDAC5, and Ser-218 and -448 in HDAC9) (26Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the CaMK cardiac isoform IIδB would phosphorylate these serines of class II HDACs in cardiac cells. To test this we performed an in vitro kinase assay with purified activated CaMKIIδB-T287D and similar amounts of substrate polypeptides of HDAC4, -5, and -9 (Fig. 1A, lower panel) encompassing the conserved serines fused to GST. Although GST-HDAC4 was strongly phosphorylated by the kinase, quite unexpectedly, the GST-HDAC5 and GST-HDAC9 fusion proteins were not (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 3, and 5). Thus CaMKIIδB specifically phosphorylated a GST-HDAC4 fusion protein encompassing amino acids 207–311 but not the equivalent GST-HDAC5 or GST-HDAC9 fragments. Furthermore, a GST-HDAC4 fusion protein bearing the regulatory Ser-246 mutated to alanine was still phosphorylated by CaMKIIδB (Fig. 1A, lane 2). In fact, the phosphorylation of the mutated protein was slightly increased compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 1, B and C). In vitro kinase assays with lesser amounts of GST-HDAC4 fusion proteins showed a similar result (Fig. 1, B (lanes 3 and 5) and C). We also performed in vitro kinase reactions with a constant amount of GST-HDAC substrates and increasing amounts of enzyme ranging from 5 to 100 ng. HDAC4, but not HDAC5 was phosphorylated by CaMKIIδB in these conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). We also verified that, in our hand"
https://openalex.org/W2074080709,"dlk1/FA1 (delta-like 1/fetal antigen-1) is a member of the epidermal growth factor-like homeotic protein family whose expression is known to modulate the differentiation signals of mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow. We have demonstrated previously that Dlk1 can maintain the human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) in an undifferentiated state. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, we compared the basal gene expression pattern in Dlk1-overexpressing hMSC cells (hMSC-dlk1) versus control hMSC (negative for Dlk1 expression) by using Affymetrix HG-U133A microarrays. In response to Dlk1 expression, 128 genes were significantly up-regulated (with >2-fold; p < 0.001), and 24% of these genes were annotated as immune response-related factors, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, in addition to factors involved in the complement system, apoptosis, and cell adhesion. Also, addition of purified FA1 to hMSC up-regulated the same factors in a dose-dependent manner. As biological consequences of up-regulating these immune response-related factors, we showed that the inhibitory effects of dlk1 on osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation of hMSC are associated with Dlk1-induced cytokine expression. Furthermore, Dlk1 promoted B cell proliferation, synergized the immune response effects of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide on hMSC, and led to marked transactivation of the NF-κB. Our data suggest a new role for Dlk1 in regulating the multiple biological functions of hMSC by influencing the composition of their microenvironment “niche.” Our findings also demonstrate a role for Dlk1 in mediating the immune response. dlk1/FA1 (delta-like 1/fetal antigen-1) is a member of the epidermal growth factor-like homeotic protein family whose expression is known to modulate the differentiation signals of mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow.

Kristiansen M. Abdallah B.M. Basic Clin. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 95: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and possibly other non-mesoderm type cells (2Jiang Y. Jahagirdar B.N. Reinhardt R.L. Schwartz R.E. Keene C.D. Ortiz-Gonzalez X.R. Reyes M. Lenvik T. Lund T. Blackstad M. Du J. Aldrich S. Lisberg A. Low W.C. Largaespada D.A. Verfaillie C.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (5125) Google Scholar). Moreover, hMSC provide supportive stroma for growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and hematopoiesis (3Majumdar M.K. Thiede M.A. Haynesworth S.E. Bruder S.P. Gerson S.L. J. Hematother. Stem Cell Res. 2000; 9: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms that control the differentiation decisions of hMSC is thus of the utmost importance from a basic bone biology point of view. It is also important for the clinical use of the hMSC in transplantation and regenerative medicine protocols (1Kassem M. Kristiansen M. Abdallah B.M. Basic Clin. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 95: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).dlk1/Pref-1 (delta-like 1/pre-adipocyte factor-1) is a transmembrane protein of the EGF-like homeotic superfamily. It is expressed from an imprinted gene paternally expressed at 14q32. Its extracellular domain contains six cysteine-rich EGF-like repeats similar to those found in the Delta/Notch/Serrate family of signaling molecules (4Fleming R.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5Laborda J. Sausville E.A. Hoffman T. Notario V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3817-3820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dlk1 plays a critical role in modulating cell fate decisions throughout development (6Laborda J. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 119-129PubMed Google Scholar). This is illustrated by the presence of high prenatal mortality, growth retardation, obesity, skeletal malformations, and abnormalities of hematopoiesis in mice deficient in Dlk1 (7Moon Y.S. Smas C.M.

Also, in the human syndrome of maternal uniparental disomy 14 (where Dlk1 is silent), patients exhibit obesity, hypotonia, premature puberty, macrocephaly, short stature, and small hands (9Berends M.J. Hordijk R. Scheffer H. Oosterwijk J.C. Halley D.J. Sorgedrager N. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 84: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Dlk1 has been known for several years as a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation (10Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that it is involved in many differentiation processes, including hematopoiesis (11Moore K.A. Pytowski B. Witte L. Hicklin D. Lemischka I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), pancreatic islet cell differentiation (12Carlsson C. Tornehave D. Lindberg K. Galante P. Billestrup N. Michelsen B. Larsson L.I.

Patterns. 2004; 5: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified Dlk1 as a novel regulator of hMSC differentiation (15Abdallah B.M. Jensen C.H. Gutierrez G. Leslie G.Q. Jensen T.G. Kassem M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 841-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular overexpression of Dlk1 or adding it as a soluble protein to hMSC led to inhibition of hMSC differentiation to osteoblasts or adipocytes (15Abdallah B.M. Jensen C.H. Gutierrez G. Leslie G.Q. Jensen T.G. Kassem M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 841-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of the dlk1 is cleaved by tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (16Wang Y. Sul H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5421-5435Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and was first identified in the amniotic fluid (17Fay T.N. Jacobs I. Teisner B. Poulsen O. Chapman M.G.

Enghild J.J. Teisner B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). FA1 is the biologically active part of the molecule, and its serum levels change in some pathological conditions, e.g. growth hormone excess (acromegaly) (19Andersen M. Jensen C.H. Stoving R.K. Larsen J.B. Schroder H.D. Teisner B. Hagen C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5465-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast to other members of Delta/Notch/Serrate family, dlk1 protein does not have the DSL (Delta, Serrate, and LAG2) domain mediating Notch-Delta interaction, and thus it is not known whether dlk1 functions as a ligand or as a receptor (6Laborda J. Histol. Histopathol. 2000; 15: 119-129PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent data based on a yeast two-hybrid system suggested that dlk1 interacts with Notch 1 and inhibits Notch signaling (20Baladron V. Ruiz-Hidalgo M.J. Nueda M.L. Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Garcia-Ramirez J.J. Bonvini E. Gubina E. Laborda J. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 343-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Also, other signaling pathways have been demonstrated to be affected by the expression of Dlk1, e.g. mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (21Ruiz-Hidalgo M.J. Gubina E. Tull L. Baladron V. Laborda J. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and insulin-like growth factor-I receptor-mediated p42/p44 MAPK activation (22Zhang H. Noohr J. Jensen C.H.

Despite this pleiotropic function of Dlk1 in many developmental and differentiation processes, little is known about the mechanisms mediating its regulatory function and its target genes.To identify the mechanisms underlying the biological effects of Dlk1 in hMSC, we employed the DNA microarray approach to discover specific molecular pathways regulated by Dlk1.We found that expression of Dlk1 increased the production of a large number of inflammatory and immune response-related factors, including cytokines, chemokines, and complement factors by hMSC, and these changes were associated with its effects on hMSC differentiation into adipocytes, osteoblasts, and its hematopoiesis-support function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The establishment and the characterization of hMSC-TERT (immortalized hMSC cells, used as a control with no Dlk1 expression) and hMSC-dlk1 (Dlk1-overexpressing cells, derived from hMSC-TERT) cell lines have been described previously (15Abdallah B.M. Jensen C.H. Gutierrez G. Leslie G.Q. Jensen T.G. Kassem M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 841-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Simonsen J.L. Rosada C. Serakinci N. Justesen J. Stenderup K. Rattan S.I. Jensen T.G. Kassem M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 592-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Normal hMSC cultures were established from bone marrow aspirates obtained from young donors (n = 5, males 25–30 years old) by aspiration from the iliac crest as described previously (24Kassem M. Mosekilde L. Eriksen E.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 1453-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A written consent was obtained from each participant, and the study was approved by the local Scientific-Ethical committee. All cells were cultured in a standard growth medium (SGM) containing minimal essential medium (MEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Collecting the Conditioned Media and Purification of FA1— hMSC-TERT or hMSC-dlk1 cells were cultured at 3 × 103 cells/cm2 in Petri dishes in standard growth medium. At 80–90% cell confluence, medium was replaced by serum-free MEM, and cells were cultured for 2 additional days. Conditioned media (CM) were then collected either from hMSC-TERT cells (control/CM) or hMSC-dlk1 (dlk1/CM), centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris, and used neat or diluted 1:2 (v/v) or 1:4 (v/v) with serum-free MEM.The full soluble ectodomain, active form of dlk1 protein named FA1, was purified from the collected serum-free CM of cultured hMSC-dlk1 (dlk1/CM) using immunospecific affinity chromatography as described previously (25Jensen C.H. Teisner B. Hojrup P. Rasmussen H.B. Madsen O.D. Nielsen B. Skjodt K. Hum. Reprod. (Oxf.). 1993; 8: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). dlk1/CM depleted of FA1 (FA1-/CM) were also collected from the affinity chromatography eluents.We were careful to avoid any endotoxin contaminations in our culture system or during FA1 preparation. To ensure that, the endotoxin levels were measured in all conditioned media and FA1 preparation as nondiluted research samples using the Endotoxin-Testing Service at Cambrex BioScience (test code 95-101; Cambrex BioScience Verviers S.p.r.l., Belgium). All conditioned media (control/CM, dlk1/CM, and FA1-/CM) and FA1 preparation used in this study were negative for contamination with endotoxins with less than 0.05 endotoxin unit/ml.Study of the Effect of FA1-containing CM and Purified FA1 on the Cytokine Expression Profile of hMSC—Normal hMSC cells established from healthy donors were cultured in 6-well plates at 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in standard growth medium. At 90–100% cell confluence, cells were cultured either in control/CM (obtained from hMSC-TERT), in dlk1/CM supplemented with 10% FCS, or in SGM supplemented with purified FA1 (1 or 5 μg/ml) for 24 h.Cell Differentiation Assays—To induce osteoblast differentiation, cells were cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in SGM for 24 h. At 70–80% confluence, the medium was replaced by osteogenic medium, consisting of an SGM supplemented with 10 nm 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (vitamin D3) (kindly provided by Leo Pharma, Denmark). The medium was replaced every 3 days.To induce adipocyte differentiation, cells were cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/cm2. At 100% confluence, the medium was replaced by adipogenic induction medium, consisting of low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS supplemented with 100 nm human recombinant insulin (Sigma), 10 nm dexamethasone, 0.25 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (Sigma), and 1 μm rosiglitazone (BRL49653) (kindly provided by Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) for 48 h and then shifted into adipogenic induction medium without dexamethasone for another 10 days. Medium was renewed every 3 days.Proliferation Assay of Cultured Human B Cells—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from buffy coats of healthy blood donors were depleted of CD19+ cells using Dynabeads CD19 Pan B (Dynal, Norway) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell-attached magnetic beads were removed by magnet after overnight incubation with DETACHBEAD CD19 (Dynal, Norway). Isolated CD19+ cells were washed twice at 1,200 rpm for 10 min at room temperature in modified Eagle's medium (without phenol red) supplemented with 200 international units/ml penicillin and counted in trypan blue. Cells were then resuspended at 0.5 × 106/ml in RPMI (as a positive control), serum-free conditioned medium from hMSC-TERT (control/CM), or hMSC-dlk1 (dlk1/CM) supplemented with 10% FCS and stimulated with 20 ng/ml recombinant human IL-4 (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) and the indicated concentrations of recombinant human CD40L (R&D Systems) or left untreated (nonstimulated). Cells were seeded in flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates (50,000 cells per well in 100 μl of medium) and incubated at 37 °C. At day 3 of culture, 100 μl of fresh media supplemented with IL-4 and CD40L were added. At day 6 of cell culture, metabolic activity of the cells was measured with an XTT assay (Biological Industries, Israel). Data were represented as fold induction of the proliferation of B cells over control CD19+ cells cultured in nonstimulated CM.Microarrays—Both control (hMSC-TERT) and Dlk1-overexpressing cells (hMSC-dlk1) were cultured in triplicate at 3 × 104 cells/cm2 in Petri dishes in standard growth medium. At 90–100% confluence, highly purified total cellular RNA was isolated from each of three independent cultures per cell line using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Nordic, West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First- and second-strand cDNA syntheses were performed from 8 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript Choice System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cRNA was synthesized from cDNA and biotinylated using the BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo® kit, Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY), according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer, and hybridized for 16–18 h at 45 °C in a rotisserie to the Affymetrix® Human Genome U133A 2.0 arrays. The arrays were scanned using the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix).Data analysis was performed using the dChip software (26Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). We first normalized our probe level data using the invariant set normalization procedure (26Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar). The normalized probe level data were converted to model-based gene expression indexes (MBEI, log with base 2) for use as the values of gene expression for a total of 22,000 genes on the Affymetrix 133A 2.0 arrays. The paired t statistic was used to assess the genes that are differentially regulated in the two cell lines by assigning the hMSC-TERT cell line as reference and the hMSC-dlk1 cell line as the experiment group. The false discovery rate (27Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9705) Google Scholar) was calculated for each of the genes to account for multiple testing. Significant genes were identified as those with a mean expression ratio between the experiment and the reference groups above 2 and below 2 and at the same time a false discovery rate of <0.05. Hierarchical clustering analysis was applied to cluster the genes as well as the samples using the average linkage method. Gene ontology classifications for all differentially expressed genes by Dlk1 in hMSC were performed using DAVID 2.0 software (28Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Hosack D.A. Yang J. Gao W. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: P3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and EASE software (29Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genes were classified according to their molecular function and relevant biological process. The microarray data were deposited in the Array Express public data base with assigned accession number (E-MEXP-560).Total RNA Extraction and Real Time PCR Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated using a single step method with TRIzol (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand complementary cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA using a revertAid H minus first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, Copenhagen, Denmark) according to the manual instructions.Real time PCR was performed using the iCycler IQ detection system (Bio-Rad) and SYBR® Green I as a double strand DNA-specific binding dye. Thermocycling was performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 3 μl of cDNA sample (diluted 1:20), 20 pmol of each primer, and 2× iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The quantification of gene expression for each target gene and reference gene was performed in separate tubes using primers as shown in supplemental Table 1. We used a denaturing step at 95 °C for 3 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. Each reaction was run in duplicate, and fluorescence data were collected at the end of the extension step in every cycle.To ensure specific amplification, a melting curve was calculated for each PCR by increasing the temperature from 60 to 95 °C with a temperature increment rate of 0.5 °C/10 s. Fold induction and expression level for each target gene were calculated using the comparative CT method as follows: 1/(2ΔCT), where ΔCT is the difference between CT target and CT reference. After normalization to β-actin mRNA (User Bulletin No. 2, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), data were analyzed using optical system software version 3.1 (Bio-Rad) and Microsoft Excel 2000 to generate relative expression values.In Situ Detection of NF-κB Nuclear Translocation—Control cells (hMSC-TERT) were seeded at 3,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and cultured for 2 days in normal medium. Cells were exposed for 15, 30, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C to nondiluted CM prepared either from control or hMSC-dlk1 cells. As a positive control for NF-κB activation, some wells were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS. In situ detection of NF-κB nuclear translocation was carried out as described previously (30Boissy P. Andersen T.L. Abdallah B.M. Kassem M. Plesner T. Delaisse J.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9943-9952Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed first in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then with cold methanol for 15 min at -20 °C. Cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in bovine serum albumin/PBS overnight at 4 °C, washed several times in PBS, and subsequently incubated with a secondary AlexaFluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen) in bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes, the nucleus of cells was counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Pictures of Hoechst and anti-p65 immunofluorescence were taken randomly in different areas of the wells with a coolsnap camera (Roper Scientific, Brock & Michelsen, Birkerød, Denmark) plugged to a stage-motorized inverted Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss, Brock & Michelsen). Cells showing a bright immunofluorescence for p65 in the nucleus were scored using MetaVue® image analyzing software (Universal Imaging Corp., Brock & Michelsen). The results were presented as the number of cells with NF-κB nuclear translocation in percentage of the total number of nuclei scrutinized.Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test using unpaired t test (two-tailed). p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSTo identify the genetic pathways regulated by the expression of Dlk1, we studied the basal gene expression pattern in Dlk1-overexpressing hMSC cells versus control hMSC-TERT cells using Affymetrix DNA microarrays. A total of 315 probe sets corresponding to 277 genes/expressed sequence tags were found to be differentially expressed in response to Dlk1 expression. Among these, 157 probes corresponding to 128 genes were up-regulated (>2-fold, p < 0.001), whereas158 probe sets corresponding to 149 genes were down-regulated (<2-fold, p < 0.001) in hMSC-dlk1 compared with control cells. Gene annotation based on biological processes and molecular functions revealed the presence of 24% immune response-related genes, whereas the other 76% were assigned to different functional categories, such as signal transduction, cell adhesion, metabolism, apoptosis, and others (Fig. 1, A and B). On the other hand, Dlk1 down-regulated genes were mainly annotated as DNA replication-related genes and cell growth and/or maintenance genes (see the supplemental Table 2).As shown in Table 1, the largest category of the up-regulated genes was annotated as immune regulatory factors, which include several potent pro-inflammatory cytokines, a large number of chemokines, the complement components C3 and C1 that are known as key factors for the activation of the complement pathway (31Mastellos D. Lambris J.D. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 485-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), prostaglandin E synthase, and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX-2) that are up-regulated in response to IL-1β (32Samad T.A.

Nature. 1998; 391: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). In addition, the apoptosis-annotated gene group included numerous genes such as CASP1, CASP8, TNFRSF9, TNFRSF21, and TNFAIP3 that function cooperatively with some cytokines to induce cell death and activate NF-κB signaling (34Heyninck K. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2001; 4: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Given the gene expression pattern found, we decided to focus on studying Dlk1-up-regulated genes, especially the pro-inflammatory cytokines.TABLE 1Genes differentially up-regulated by Dlk1 in hMSCGene accession no.Gene nameGene symbolFold changeImmune response NM_000575Interleukin 1αIL1A10.6 NM_000576Interleukin 1βIL1B7.1 NM_000600Interleukin 6 (interferon β2)IL68.5 NM_000584Interleukin 8IL88.5 NM_001511Chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 1 (melanoma growth-stimulating activity, α)CXCL12.4 NM_002089Chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 2CXCL25.2 NM_002090Chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 3CXCL35.4 NM_002993Chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 6 (granulocyte chemotactic protein 2)CXCL618.5 NM_005409Chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 11CXCL115.9 NM_004591Chemokine (CC motif) ligand 20CCL208.1 NM_000064Complement component 3C315.2 NM_001734Complement component 1. s subcomponentC1S3.6 NM_001733Homo sapiens cDNA FLJ36690 fis. clone UTERU2008707. highly similar to COMPLEMENT C1R COMPONENT PRECURSOR (EC 3.4.21.41).C1R3.2 NM_004878Prostaglandin E synthasePTGES3.6 NM_000963Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (prostaglandin G/H synthase and cyclooxygenase)PTGS25.5 NM_000636Superoxide dismutase 2.

https://openalex.org/W2022411637,"The heterodimeric actin-capping protein (CP) can be inhibited by polyphosphoinositides, which may be important for actin polymerization at membranes in cells. Here, we have identified a conserved set of basic residues on the surface of CP that are important for the interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Computational docking studies predicted the identity of residues involved in this interaction, and functional and physical assays with site-directed mutants of CP confirmed the prediction. The PIP2 binding site overlaps with the more important of the two known actin-binding sites of CP. Correspondingly, we observed that loss of PIP2 binding correlated with loss of actin binding among the mutants. Using TIRF (total internal reflection fluorescence) microscopy, we observed that PIP2 rapidly converted capped actin filaments to a growing state, consistent with uncapping. Together, these results extend our understanding of how CP binds to the barbed end of the actin filament, and they support the idea that CP can “wobble” when bound to the barbed end solely by the C-terminal “tentacle” of its β-subunit.

Actin polymerization is essential for many biological phenomena, including the cell migration that occurs as part of chemotaxis, development, and cancer. Cells regulate the location and timing of actin polymerization with remarkable precision. In cells, actin filaments grow primarily by the addition of subunits to free, barbed ends of filaments. Free barbed ends can be created by actin nucleation factors, such as Arp2/3 complex and formins, and by actin-severing proteins, such as ADF/cofilin and gelsolin. Capping proteins bind to free barbed ends and thereby halt the polymerization process. The α/β heterodimeric capping protein, referred to here as CP, 5The abbreviations used are: CP, capping protein; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; DTT, dithiothreitol. 5The abbreviations used are: CP, capping protein; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence; DTT, dithiothreitol. is a capper found in essentially every eukaryotic organism and in every vertebrate cell and tissue type (reviewed in Ref. 1Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 8: 418-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In vertebrate striated muscle, a sarcomere-specific isoform of CP at the Z-line caps the barbed ends of the actin-based thin filaments, leading to the name CapZ. Cells lacking CP show a range of morphologic and developmental defects, based on improper actin assembly and cell motility. In Drosophila, loss of CP is lethal during embryogenesis. Typical vertebrate cultured cells contain lamellipodial and filopodial processes on their surface, which are based on actin filaments organized into branched networks and straight bundles, respectively. In each case, barbed ends are oriented predominantly toward the plasma membrane, and the local capping of barbed ends is crucial. The branched networks of filaments in lamellipodia are nucleated from Arp2/3 complex, as described in the dendritic nucleation model (2Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 4: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (3250) Google Scholar). Capping of the barbed ends over time is a necessary feature of this model in order to keep the filaments short, which makes the branched network stiff, and to restrict or “funnel” polymerization to the newly created barbed ends near the membrane. Inhibition of CP essentially abolishes the formation of lamellipodia and branched networks (3Mejillano M.R. Kojima S. Applewhite D.A. Gertler F.B. Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2004; 3: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In such cells, filopodia formation is greatly enhanced, which contributes to the notion that localized inhibition of CP at one place on the membrane may be essential for a filopodium to form. In vitro, actin-based motility can be reconstituted from pure proteins with a mixture of Arp2/3 complex, ADF/cofilin, and CP (4Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Nature. 1999; 6753: 613-616Crossref Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Here, the dependence of motility on CP concentration was a bell-shaped curve, suggesting that optimal levels of capping may be crucial for actin-based motility in cells. Indeed, Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly as part of endocytosis in yeast does depend on optimal CP activity (5Kim K. Galletta B.J. Schmidt K.O. Chang F.S. Blumer K.J. Cooper J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). CP is active in the absence of calcium and under a wide range of buffer conditions. However, cells contain a number of proteins that are able to bind to and inhibit CP, such as V-1/myotrophin, CKIP-1, CD2AP, and CARMIL (6Bhattacharya N. Ghosh S. Sept D. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31021-31030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Bruck S. Huber T.B. Ingham R.J. Kim K. Niederstrasser H. Allen P.M. Pawson T. Cooper J.A. Shaw A.S. J.

Cell. 2005; 2: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, polyphosphoinositides such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) can bind and inhibit CP (10Huang S. Gao L. Blanchoin L. Staiger C.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1946-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Of note, PIP2 appears to be able to remove CP from capped barbed ends (11Schafer D.A. Jennings P.B. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 1: 169-179Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar), which may help to stimulate actin assembly in certain situations in cells. During platelet activation, an initial step appears to be release of CP from the actin cytoskeleton by PIP2 (12Barkalow K. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 2: 389-399Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar); later in the process, CP appears to return to the actin cytoskeleton, presumably binding newly formed barbed ends. Association of CP with the actin cytoskeleton is also seen with actin assembly in Dictyostelium cells responding to chemoattractant (13Eddy R.J. Han J. Condeelis J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of CP shows the α- and β-subunits arranged with a pseudo-2-fold rotational axis of symmetry (14Yamashita A. Maé;da K. Maé;da Y. EMBO J. 2003; 7: 1529-1538Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In molecular dynamics simulations, the C-terminal region of the β-subunit is highly mobile, and the C-terminal region of the α-subunit remains closely apposed to the surface of the protein (6Bhattacharya N. Ghosh S. Sept D. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31021-31030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), as suggested by the crystal structure. A recent cryo-electron microscopy analysis of CP bound to the barbed end of the actin filament shows the top surface of CP in contact with actin, with the C-terminal regions of each subunit as likely sites of close contact (15Narita A. Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5626-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In biochemical studies, the C-terminal region of each subunit appears to be able to bind to the barbed end, and those interactions are independent of each other (16Kim K. Yamashita A. Wear M.A. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 4: 567-580Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maé;da Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). When both actin-binding sites are intact, CP binds to the barbed end with subnanomolar affinity because of a low off-rate constant (17Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maé;da Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our current view of the interaction of CP with the filament barbed end includes the hypothesis that when CP is attached solely by its β-tentacle, it is able to wobble. This exposes the top surface of the protein, which includes the actin-binding site near the α-subunit C terminus. Recent findings with the protein V-1/myotrophin support this view (6Bhattacharya N. Ghosh S. Sept D. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31021-31030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). V-1 appears to bind the β-subunit C terminus, and V-1 inhibits capping but does not uncap, as predicted by the hypothesis. Another prediction of the hypothesis is that a molecule that is able to uncap should bind to the top surface of the protein, and this interaction should be independent of the β-tentacle. In this study, to gain insight into how PIP2 binds CP, how PIP2 binding inhibits CP, and how CP binds actin, we wanted to perform a structure/function analysis with site-directed mutagenesis to identify regions of CP necessary for interaction with PIP2. We also performed computational modeling of CP/PIP2 interactions to help guide the mutagenesis and to provide independent and complementary evidence regarding the nature of the interaction. In addition, we sought new evidence for the uncapping effect of PIP2, with direct visualization of actin filament growth in real time by TIRF microscopy. Finally, we wanted to use these results to test the wobble model for the interaction of CP with the filament barbed end. Chemicals and reagents were from Fisher Scientific and Sigma unless stated otherwise. PIP2 and 1,2-di-oleyoyl ethylene glycol (diacylglycerol) were obtained from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). Synthetic acyl-chain variants of PIP2 with diC4, diC8, and diC16 were obtained from Echelon Biosciences (Salt Lake City, UT). Concentrated phospholipid stock solutions were prepared and handled as described (28Heiss S.G. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8753-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutations were created in a chicken CP α1β1 pET bacterial expression plasmid (pBJ994) (18Soeno Y. Abe H. Kimura S. Maruyama K. Obinata T. J Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 6: 639-646Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) by PCR using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers and plasmids are listed in supplemental Tables I and II, respectively. pET-3d/CPα(K256A)β, encoding a K256A mutation in the α-subunit, was constructed using forward primer KKT 255 and reverse primer KKT 256. pET-3d/CPα(R260A)β, encoding an R260A mutation in the α-subunit, was constructed using KKT 216 and 217. pET-3d/CPαβ(K95A), encoding a K95A mutation in the β-subunit, was constructed using KKT 205 and KKT 206. pET-3d/CPα(KR256, 260AA)β, encoding a R256A, K260A mutation in the α-chain, was constructed using pET-3d/CPα(K256A)β as template and primers KKT 216 and KKT 217. pET3d/CPα(RK266, 268AA)β, encoding an RK266, 268AA mutation in the α-subunit, was constructed using KKT 214 and KKT 215. pET-3d/CPα(R256A, K260A)β(R225A), encoding a R256A, K260A mutation in the α-subunit and an R225A mutation in the β-subunit, was constructed with primers KKT 257 and KKT 258 using pET-3d/CPα(R256A, K260A)β as a template plasmid. Proteins—CP was expressed in bacteria and purified as described (16Kim K. Yamashita A. Wear M.A. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 4: 567-580Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with minor modifications for mutants. Purified proteins were stored at -20 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 50% glycerol. Muscle actin was purified and labeled with pyrene as described (17Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maé;da Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Spectrin-F-actin seeds were prepared from human erythrocytes as described (19DiNubile M.J. Cassimeris L. Joyce M. Zigmond S.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 12: 1659-1671Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Actin capping assays were performed as described (16Kim K. Yamashita A. Wear M.A. Maeda Y. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 4: 567-580Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Rabbit skeletal muscle myosin (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) (10 μm) was dialyzed against 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 0.5 m KCl, 10 mm EDTA for 2 h. Following a 1-h incubation with 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide on ice, 1 mm DTT was added for 1 h on ice. N-ethylmaleimide-myosin was dialyzed overnight against 50% glycerol in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7, 0.5 m KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1mm DTT and stored at -20 °C. Fitting of Actin Polymerization Reactions—Binding constants for CP with actin and lipids were determined by least-squares fitting of full time course data using Berkeley Madonna 8.3 as described (17Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maé;da Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with the following kinetic mechanism. In these reactions, A is actin monomer, Nb is free barbed end, CP is capping protein, and L is lipid. In this simple scheme, the capped barbed end, CPNb, can neither add nor lose actin subunits; the complex of CP with lipid, CPL, cannot interact with a barbed end. For Reaction 1, k+ was 11.6 μm -1 s-1 and k- was 1.4 s-1 (20Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The rate constants for capping in Reaction 2 were determined by fitting the experimental data for seeded actin assembly in the presence of CP. A range of CP concentrations was used, generating a family of curves, and they were fit together. The rate constants for CP binding to lipid in Reaction 3 were determined by fitting a set of curves produced by addition of PIP2 at various concentrations. Tryptophan Quenching Assay for CP/Lipid Interaction—The equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, for the binding of CP to phospholipid was determined by measuring the quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as described (21Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14382-14390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, fluorescence emission spectra (300-400 nm) were collected using a PTI Quantmaster spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ) with excitation at 292 nm. The mixture of CP and phospholipid was incubated for 5 min before was fluorescence measured. The maximum fluorescence intensity (ΔF) was plotted against the total concentration of PIP2, and Kd was determined by leastsquares fitting as described (21Wear M.A. Cooper J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14382-14390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). TIRF Microscopy—To image the polymerization of individual actin filaments, we used TIRF microscopy essentially as described (22Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 1387-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The system included an inverted microscope (IX-81, Olympus America, Center Valley, PA), an electronmultiplication back-thinned frame transfer charge-coupled device video camera (Model C9100-12, Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ) with a 60× 1.45 numerical aperture PlanApo oil objective. SlideBook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO) operated the system and collected the images. Frames of 1500-ms duration were collected every 2-3 min. Measurements of filament length versus time were obtained. To construct the microscope flow chamber, No. 0 sapphire coverslips were sonicated in a water bath sonicator for 45 min in 2% (v/v) VersaClean detergent in hot tap water, rinsed in hot tap water, and sonicated for 30 min in hot tap water. Coverslips were rinsed in distilled water, incubated for 3 h in 1 m KOH at 42 °C, rinsed in deionized distilled water, and incubated overnight in 1 m HCl at 42 °C. They were cooled to room temperature, rinsed in deionized distilled water, sonicated for 30 min in deionized distilled water, rinsed twice in 5 mm EDTA, and sonicated for 30 min in EDTA. They were rinsed in 70% ethanol, sonicated for 30 min in 70% ethanol, rinsed in absolute ethanol, sonicated for 30 min in absolute ethanol, and rinsed and stored in absolute ethanol. Flow cell chambers were prepared as described (23Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). A clean sapphire coverslip was removed from ethanol and dried. Parafilm strips were stretched to approximately three times their length and placed across the long axis of the coverslip. A conventional glass slide was placed on and perpendicular to the parafilm strips. Pressure was applied and the chamber was flamed briefly to seal it. Solutions were flowed into the chamber via capillary action. For actin polymerization experiments, unlabeled and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled rabbit muscle actin (Invitrogen) were dialyzed overnight against G buffer and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The upper two-thirds of the supernatant was taken, and the actin concentration was measured by absorbance at 290 nm. Ca-ATP-actin was converted to Mg-ATP-actin by incubation with a 1/10 volume of 10 mm EGTA/0.2 mm MgCl2 at 23 °C for 2 min. N-ethylmaleimide-inactivated myosin at 0.1 μm in high salt Tris-buffered saline (HS-TBS; 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 600 mm NaCl) was flowed into the chamber and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. The chamber was washed with 1% bovine serum albumin in HS-TBS followed by 1% bovine serum albumin in low salt Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl). To polymerize actin filaments, Mg-ATP-actin with 10% Alexa-labeled actin was mixed 1:1 with 2× polymerization buffer (100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 mm DTT, 0.4 mm ATP, 30 mm glucose, 2% methylcellulose, 40 μg/ml catalase, 200 μg/ml glucose oxidase) giving a final actin concentration of 2 μm. 0.25 nm spectrin-F actin seeds were added immediately. After 10 min at room temperature, 10 nm CP α1β1 was added. After another 10 min, 10 μl of this mixture was loaded into the flow chamber. The actin filaments were monitored for several min to document the absence of growth, and then various concentrations of PIP2 were added along with 2 μm Mg-ATP actin (30% labeled) in polymerization buffer. Actin filament growth was monitored. The rate of filament growth was measured, as was the percentage of filaments growing over time. The rate of incorporation was converted to subunits/s assuming 370 subunits/μm (24Huxley H.E. Brown W. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 30: 383-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Molecular Simulations—The starting point for our computational work was a molecular dynamics simulation of CP (Protein Data Bank code 1IZN) performed using NAMD (25Kale L. Skeel R. Bhandarkar M. Brunner R. Gursoy A. Krawetz N. Phillips J. Shinozaki A. Varadarajan K. Schulten K. J. Comput. Phys. 1999; 151: 283-312Crossref Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). We used the CHARMM27 force field, TIP3P waters, particle mesh Ewald, Berendsen temperature, and pressure coupling (NPT ensemble) and 2-fs time steps. The heating was performed in 50,000 steps with α-carbon constraints, equilibrated at 300,000 without constraints, followed by a 5-ns production trajectory. Five representative structures of CP were extracted from the simulation at 800-ps intervals. Because the macromolecule is held rigid in molecular docking simulations, using multiple protein snapshots allowed us to capture some degree of side chain and backbone flexibility, resulting in significantly improved docking results (26Mitra A. Sept D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13955-13962Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The molecular docking was carried out using AutoDock 3.0 (27Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9050) Google Scholar). As PIP2 is somewhat cumbersome to deal with as a full molecule, we used a modified form where the alkyl tails were truncated, leaving just the inositol and diacylglycerol groups (supplemental Fig. 1). This truncated version of PIP2 was minimized using the Tripos force field, and Gasteiger-Marsili charges were assigned, all using Sybyl 6.8 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). Docking was performed using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm in AutoDock. Initial docking runs using the entire CP structure showed a preference for the region around the base of the α-tentacle. Based on these results, we constructed 0.2-Aå spaced grids centered on the α-tentacle. 20 docking runs were completed for each of the five CP structures resulting in a total of 100 predictions. These results were clustered with a 3-Aå cutoff, resulting in single, top-predicted structure that was used in subsequent analysis. Structural Features of PIP2 Important for Interaction with CP—We asked what features of PIP2 were important for its interaction with CP. To measure these interactions, we tested the ability of PIP2 and related compounds to inhibit CP in an actin polymerization capping assay and to quench the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of CP. In previous studies with micelles, the degree of phosphorylation of the inositol group was found to be important, as was the anionic character of the head group in general (28Heiss S.G. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8753-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the micellar structure of PIP2 in solution might be important for its ability to bind CP, because of the clustering of anionic head groups on the micelle surface. This hypothesis is supported by previous observations that dilution of PIP2 with Triton X-100, which forms small micelles, abolishes the ability of PIP2 to inhibit CP but that dilution with liposome-forming lipids does not (28Heiss S.G. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8753-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To test this idea further, we used synthetic versions of PIP2 with shorter acyl chains. The diC4, diC8, and diC16 synthetic forms of PIP2 have 4, 8, and 16 carbons per acyl chain, respectively, whereas PIP2 purified from natural sources has one C18 and one C20 chain. Purified PIP2 at concentrations up to 5 μm completely inhibited the capping activity of 4 nm CP (Fig. 1A). The curves were fit well by a simple model of CP binding to PIP2 (Fig. 1A, gray lines), with a Kd of 0.33 ± 0.04 μm. diC4-PIP2 showed no effect on the actin capping activity of CP (Fig. 1B), and diC8-PIP2 inhibited CP partially, with an apparent Kd of 68 μm (Fig. 1C). These concentrations are below the expected CMC (critical micellar concentration) values for diC4- and diC8-PIP2 (29Campbell R.B. Liu F. Ross A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33617-33620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 30Rebecchi M.J. Eberhardt R. Delaney T. Ali S. Bittman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1735-1741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). diC16-PIP2 inhibited CP completely with a Kd of ∼ 0.3 μm (Fig. 1D), comparable with the value for PIP2, which is less than the expected CMC value. To test physical binding, we used quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (10Huang S. Gao L. Blanchoin L. Staiger C.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1946-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PIP2 quenched the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of CP, with no change in the maximum emission wavelength. The effect was saturable at high PIP2 concentration (Fig. 2A). A simple 1:1 binding model fit the data well (Fig. 2A, gray lines), with a Kd of 5.2 ± 0.2 μm, similar to a previous value for mouse CP in this type of assay (10Huang S. Gao L. Blanchoin L. Staiger C.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1946-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). diC4-PIP2 and diC8-PIP2 had little effect, whereas diC16-PIP2 produced saturable quenching with a Kd of 7 μm (Fig. 2B), close to the value for purified PIP2. These result support the notion that the ability of PIP2 to assemble in micelles is important for binding and inhibition of CP, presumably because of multimerization of the anionic head groups. Next, we tested the head group alone, by using IP3 (inositol-1,4,5 triphosphate). In an actin polymerization seeded growth assay, IP3 at 100 μm had no effect on the capping activity of 4 nm CP (data not shown). In a tryptophan fluorescence titration, addition of IP3 to concentrations >100 μm had no effect on the fluorescence of CP (Fig. 2B). As part of this experiment, we tested diacylglycerol, to represent the lipid portion of PIP2. Again, no effect was seen (Fig. 2B). Thus, neither the head group nor the lipid backbone of the PIP2 molecule is sufficient to bind CP, even at high concentrations. Computational Docking Analysis of PIP2/CP Interaction—To predict potential sites of interaction between PIP2 and CP, we used a computational molecular docking approach. We began with a collection of CP structures produced by molecular dynamics simulation. The use of multiple structures for CP allowed us to sample different side chain and backbone conformations, and because we performed flexible docking where the rotatable bonds in PIP2 were allowed to move freely, this approach captured some degree of flexibility for both molecules. The molecular docking studies resulted in a clear single prediction for the structure of the complex of PIP2 and CP. As one may have anticipated based on the anionic character of PIP2, we saw interaction primarily with a group of basic residues on the surface of CP. This group included Lys-256 and Arg-260 of the α-subunit and Arg-225 of the β-subunit (Fig. 3, A and B). Given the residues and charged groups involved, the interactions are predominantly electrostatic in nature, with the addition of several hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3B). The inositol ring sits in a pocket formed by these residues, between the two subunits, and the location and orientation of these basic side chains suggests some degree of specificity for PI(4,5)P2 versus other phosphoinositides, as observed previously (28Heiss S.G. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8753-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In terms of the primary amino acid sequence, Lys-256 and Arg-260 are two residues in a conserved cluster of multiple basic residues near the C terminus of the CP α-subunit (Fig. 3C). Among these conserved basic residues, the CP crystal structure shows that Lys-256, Arg-260, Arg-266, and Lys-268 are on the surface and exposed to solvent (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Arg-259 is conserved but buried, where it forms an ionic bond with the conserved acidic residue Glu-221 of the β-subunit. Residue Arg-225 of CP β is also highly conserved in sequence alignments and exposed to solvent in the crystal structure. The C-terminal region of the α-subunit has been implicated in binding to actin (17Wear M.A. Yamashita A. Kim K. Maé;da Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1531-1537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), so the presence of a PIP2 micelle at this site would be expected to provide an effective steric block to actin binding, as seen for villin, for example (31Kumar N. Zhao P. Tomar A. Galea C.A. Khurana S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3096-3110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Mutation of the Conserved Basic Residues—To test for involvement of this basic patch in binding PIP2, we introduced point and truncation mutations into the region. First, we tested binding with tryptophan quenching as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. For the residues implicated by the computational docking analysis, the single mutants CP α1(K256A)β1, CP α1(R260A)β1 and CP α1β1(R225A) bound PIP2 normally. The double mutant CP α1(R256A, K260A) β1 bound more weakly, with a Kd of 12 μm, compared with 5 μm for wild-type CP. The triple mutant CP α1(R256A, K260A)β1(R225A) had a higher Kd of 19 μm.TABLE 1Binding constants for the interaction of CP mutants with PIP2 from tryptophan fluorescence quenchingCP speciesKdμMα1β15.2 ± 0.2α1β13.6 ± 0.6α1β1 (ΔC34)3.1 ± 0.2α1 (ΔC28)β117α1 (K266AR68A)β15.1 ± 0.7α1 (K256A)β16.2 ± 0.7α1 (R260A)β13.6 ± 0.2α1 (R256AK60A)β112 ± 1.5α1 (K95A)β12.6 ± 0.5α1β1 (R225A)2.8 ± 1.0α1 (R256A,K260A)β1 (R225A)19 ± 3 Open table in a new tab The α-subunit double mutant KR266, 268AA bound to PIP2 with normal affinity (Table 1).

Using structure-deduced mutations that disrupt oligomerization interfaces, we found that both G- and E-domain interactions are required for gephyrin scaffolding. In addition, we report that the postsynaptic localization of the gephyrin scaffold depends on the GlyRβ binding region of the E-domain. Intact E- and G-domains are also a prerequisite for the formation of gephyrin hexamers, which we propose to represent novel intermediates of the scaffold assembly reaction. Together, our data indicate that oligomerization via the G- and E-domains is essential for gephyrin scaffold formation and, hence, the clustering of inhibitory receptors at developing synapses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Gephyrin Constructs—The region encoding the G-domain of gephyrin (amino acids 1-181) was amplified by PCR using Geph-pRSET (15Sola M.

All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—N-terminal His6-tagged wild-type and mutant domain proteins were expressed using the pQE-30/31 (Qiagen) expression system in E. coli BL21 DE3 (Novagen), whereas G4xR was expressed in E. coli C41 DE3 (21Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins were purified as described (15Sola M. Bavro V.N. Timmins J. Franz T. Ricard-Blum S. Schoehn G. Ruigrok R.W.H. Paarmann I. Saiyed T. O'Sullivan G.A. Schmitt B. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and directly used for gel filtration chromatography.Size Exclusion Chromatography—The recombinant wild-type and mutant G- and E-domain proteins were used. The purified proteins were subjected to chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (2.4 ml) in His6 elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol) using a SMART separation unit (Amersham Biosciences). All samples including standard marker proteins (Bio-Rad) were analyzed under identical conditions (6 °C, flow rate 40 μl/min, 50-μl fractions).BN-PAGE of [35S]Methionine-labeled Full-length Gephyrin Purified from Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Collagenase-defolliculated oocytes were injected with capped cRNAs and metabolically labeled by overnight incubation at 19 °C in frog Ringer’s solution (90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with ∼40 MBq/ml l-[35S]methionine (>40 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, ∼0.1 MBq/oocyte). Oocytes were lysed in homogenization buffer consisting of 1% (w/v) digitonin (Merck Biosciences) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and protease inhibitors (10 μm antipain, 5 μm pepstatin A, 50 μm leupeptin, 100 μm Pefabloc SC). Full-length wild-type and mutant gephyrin proteins were purified as His-tagged proteins under non-denaturing conditions from the centrifugation-cleared digitonin extracts using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) essentially as described previously (22Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Pilot experiments revealed that the migration of gephyrin in the BN-PAGE gel was not affected by the inclusion of digitonin in the washing and elution buffers. Accordingly, digitonin was only used for the initial homogenization of the oocytes and excluded from all further purification steps. Proteins were eluted from the beads by two subsequent incubations with 250 mm imidazole/HCl, pH 7.4, each for 15 min at ambient temperature. Within 1-2 h of purification, proteins were separated on BN-PAGE gels (4-16% acrylamide) (23Schaögger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) as described (22Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G.

Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, which was scanned with a Storm 820 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using the ImageQuant software.Transfection of HEK 293T Cells and Hippocampal Neurons—HEK 293T cells were cultured on glass coverslips and transfected with cDNAs encoding gephyrin constructs using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as detailed previously (24Kirsch J. Kuhse J. Betz H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 450-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After 24 h of transfection, cells were fixed and processed for immunocytochemistry. Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from 18 day-old rat embryos and newborn gephyrin knock-out mice and cultured as described (20Fuhrmann J.C. Kins S. Rostaing P. El Far O. Kirsch J. Sheng M. Triller A. Betz H. Kneussel M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5393-5402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were transfected at days in vitro (DIV) 12 or 13 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and fixed at DIV 18.Immunofluorescence Staining—HEK 293T cells and hippocampal neurons were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10-12 min. Fixation and immunostaining were performed essentially as described (20Fuhrmann J.C. Kins S. Rostaing P. El Far O. Kirsch J. Sheng M. Triller A. Betz H. Kneussel M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5393-5402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and incubated with primary antibody for 90 min. GFP was visualized by autofluorescence. For the detection of VIAAT, a primary rabbit antibody (1:1000) from Synaptic Systems (Goöttingen, Germany), and the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 546 (1:1000) from Molecular Probes were used. Immunostainings were analyzed using a Leica TCS-SP confocal laser scanning microscope. All confocal images are displayed as flattened stacks obtained from sections in the z-axis.RESULTSDesign of Gephyrin Constructs with Impaired Oligomerization Properties—The crystal structure of the G-domain of gephyrin (13Sola M. Kneussel M. Heck I.S. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. J. Biol.

We used site-directed mutagenesis to replace these G-domain residues by 4 arginines, which due to hydrophilicity and charge were anticipated to abolish the interactions required for trimerization (Fig. 1A). Similarly, based on the crystallographic data available for the E-domain dimer (15Sola M. Bavro V.N. Timmins J. Franz T. Ricard-Blum S. Schoehn G. Ruigrok R.W.H. Paarmann I. Saiyed T. O'Sullivan G.A. Schmitt B. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), 3 amino acids (Gly-483, Arg-523, and Ala-532) predicted to be located at the dimer interface (Fig. 1C) were substituted with arginines or glutamic acid (Fig. 1A). The murine gephyrin gene comprises 30 exons. Of these, 10 exons or “cassettes”, named C1 to C7 and C4′ to C6′, have been found to be subject to alternative splicing, thus giving rise to a potentially large diversity of gephyrin isoforms (11Prior P. Schmitt B. Grenningloh G. Pribilla I. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Maulet Y. Werner P. Langosch D. Kirsch J. Betz H.

A. 2000; 97: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One of these cassettes, C5′ (13 amino acids), encoded by exon 6, has been proposed to interfere with gephyrin binding to the GlyR and thereby to generate a GABAAR-specific postsynaptic gephyrin scaffold (26Meier J. De Chaldee M. Triller A. Vannier C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 28Meier J. Grantyn R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To examine the role of C5′ in gephyrin interaction, we also generated constructs containing this cassette for oligomerization studies (Fig. 1A).The different domain constructs were named G4xR (harboring substitutions F90R, L113R, L128R, and L168R), ERER (G483R, R523E, and A532R), and GC5′ (containing cassette C5′) and the corresponding full-length constructs Geph4xR, GephRER, and GephC5′, respectively. In addition, we used Gephmut containing an E-domain mutation (see “Experimental Procedures”), which abolishes GlyRβ binding but does not affect C-terminal dimerization (15Sola M. Bavro V.N. Timmins J. Franz T. Ricard-Blum S. Schoehn G. Ruigrok R.W.H. Paarmann I. Saiyed T. O'Sullivan G.A. Schmitt B. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Gel Filtration Chromatography of Gephyrin Domain Constructs—After bacterial expression and affinity purification, recombinant wild-type and mutant gephyrin domain proteins were subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column. The wild-type G-domain eluted at a position corresponding to a size of 58 ± 8 kDa (n = 5) (Fig. 1D). Because the calculated molecular mass of the recombinant G-domain is ∼22 kDa, this result is consistent with the previously reported trimer formation of the G-domain (13Sola M. Kneussel M. Heck I.S. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25294-25301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, recombinant G4xR eluted in a major peak at 21 ± 6 kDa, which corresponds to the molecular mass of the monomeric G-domain (Fig. 1D). Thus, the 4 arginine substitutions within the G-domain interface disrupted the trimerization of this N-terminal region of gephyrin. Recombinant GC5′ eluted in a major peak corresponding to 22 ± 4 kDa and a minor peak of 44 ± 5 kDa (Fig. 1D). Apparently, insertion of the C5′ cassette impairs G-domain trimerization.The isolated gephyrin E-domain has been shown to form dimers in solution (15Sola M. Bavro V.N. Timmins J. Franz T. Ricard-Blum S. Schoehn G. Ruigrok R.W.H. Paarmann I. Saiyed T. O'Sullivan G.A. Schmitt B. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In agreement with these earlier data, recombinant wild-type E-domain protein, with a calculated mass of 48 kDa, eluted from the column at a volume corresponding to 102 ± 13 kDa (Fig. 1E). In contrast, for the ERER mutant protein carrying 3 charged amino acid substitutions at its dimer interface a major peak was observed at a position corresponding to 59 ± 4 kDa, i.e. a molecular mass corresponding to the E-domain monomer (Fig. 1E). Additionally, a minor peak at the position of the dimer was detectable. Thus, the mutations introduced at the predicted dimer interface of the E-domain largely disrupted dimer formation. For Emut, an E-domain construct impaired in GlyRβ binding (Fig. 1A), a dimeric structure has been established previously (15Sola M. Bavro V.N. Timmins J. Franz T. Ricard-Blum S. Schoehn G.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2510-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Oligomerization Properties of Full-length Gephyrin Constructs—The gel filtration data shown above indicate that charge substitutions at G- and E-domain interfaces impair oligomerization of the individual gephyrin subdomains. To assess the effect of these assembly mutations on full-length gephyrin, we used BN-PAGE, which permits gel electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions and, thus, determination of the oligomeric structure of proteins (22Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 29Schaögger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). Recombinant full-length gephyrin purified by metal affinity chromatography from [35S]methionine-labeled X. laevis oocytes migrated upon BN-PAGE as a major band with an apparent mass of ∼640 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 1) as assessed by comparison with soluble mass markers. In addition, higher order complexes accumulated at the interface between stacking and separating gels. We then treated the natively purified gephyrin with urea and SDS to dissociate the protein oligomer into lower order intermediates by weakening non-covalent subunit interactions (30Gendreau S. Voswinkel S. Torres-Salazar D. Lang N. Heidtmann H. Detro-Dassen S. Schmalzing G. Hidalgo P. Fahlke C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39505-39512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The 640-kDa gephyrin band and the high molecular mass complexes seen at the top of the separating gel proved to be very sensitive to SDS and were converted almost completely to monomeric gephyrin migrating at ∼110 kDa in SDS concentrations ≥0.01% (lane 7). By careful titration with low concentrations of SDS, intermediate oligomeric forms of gephyrin could be generated (lanes 3-6), which were judged to constitute dimers and trimers according to their apparent masses. Some trimers were also produced when full-length gephyrin was treated with 1 m urea (lane 2). By referring to the migration of monomers and trimers at ∼110 and ∼330 kDa, respectively, the ∼640-kDa band was concluded to represent a gephyrin hexamer.FIGURE 2BN-PAGE of full-length wild-type and mutant gephyrin proteins after affinity purification from Xenopus oocyte extracts. On the left, the putative oligomeric structures of respective protein bands are schematically indicated. Wild-type gephyrin (lane 1) runs as a hexamer that, upon treatment with urea, is partially dissociated into trimers (lane 2). Treatment with increasing concentrations of SDS (lanes 3-7) gives rise to lower order oligomeric states, down to the monomer (lane 7). Gephmut (lane 11) displays a predominantly hexameric structure, whereas Geph4xR (lane 8) and GephC5′ (lane 12) behave as dimeric proteins. GephRER (lane 9) migrates to a position consistent with a trimeric structure, whereas Geph4xR,RER (lane 10) behaves as a fully monomeric protein. Note that in addition to the hexamer, higher order complexes are seen at the interface between stacking and resolving gel in lanes 1-4 and 11. Positions of marker proteins are indicated by their corresponding mass in kDa (lane 13). * marks monomer (lane 5), dimer (lane 6), and trimer (lane 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The hexameric structure of full-length gephyrin can be readily reconciled with the existence of the two independent oligomerization interfaces that together define the overall assembly state. Accordingly, trimers formed through G-domain interactions dimerize through E-domain interactions into a hexameric complex. In support of this view, the G-domain mutants Geph4xR (lane 8) and GephC5′ (lane 12) migrated as dimers upon BN-PAGE. The somewhat slower mobility of Geph4xR and GephC5′ dimers as compared with that of the major dimers produced by partially denaturing SDS treatment of wild-type gephyrin (lane 6) may reflect conformational differences. Indeed, more slowly migrating dimers were also formed as a minor byproduct of SDS-induced dissociation of wild-type gephyrin (lanes 5-7).For the E-domain mutan"
https://openalex.org/W2017542989,"We observe that the time of appearance of cellular compartmentalization correlates with atmospheric oxygen concentration. To explore this correlation, we predict and characterize the topology of all transmembrane proteins in 19 taxa and correlate differences in topology with historical atmospheric oxygen concentrations. Here we show that transmembrane proteins, individually and as a group, were probably selectively excluding oxygen in ancient ancestral taxa, and that this constraint decreased over time when atmospheric oxygen levels rose. As this constraint decreased, the size and number of communication-related transmembrane proteins increased. We suggest the hypothesis that atmospheric oxygen concentrations affected the timing of the evolution of cellular compartmentalization by constraining the size of domains necessary for communication across membranes."

Our previous studies demonstrated that expression of the constitutively active mutant form of the EGF receptor (EGFRvIII) in ovarian cancer cells led to reduction in integrin α2 surface expression, defects in cell spreading, and disruption of focal adhesions. Inhibition of EGFRvIII catalytic activity reversed the response, suggesting that EGF receptor activation regulates integrin α2. In this study we found that EGF treatment resulted in a transient loss of integrin α2 from the cell surface. Before EGF stimulation, integrin α2 and EGF receptors were associated based on biochemical and immuno-colocalization approaches. After EGF treatment, EGF receptor and integrin α2 were internalized and segregated into different compartments. Integrin α2, but not EGF receptor, was associated with caveolin-1 and GM1 (Gal_1,3GalNAc_1,4(Neu5Ac-_ 2,3)Gal_1,4Glc_1,1-ceramide) gangliosides, suggesting caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, integrin α2 was subsequently targeted to the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum. Together, these findings demonstrate that activated EGF receptor transiently modulates integrin α2 cell surface expression and stimulates integrin α2 trafficking via caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis, representing a novel mechanism by which the EGF receptor may regulate integrin-mediated cell behavior.

Epithelial ovarian carcinoma accounts for 80–90% of ovarian tumors and is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy, resulting in 16,210 deaths in 2005 (1Jemal A. Murray T. Ward E.

Because of the current inability to detect disease confined to the ovary (stage I), ∼75% of women are initially diagnosed with disseminated intra-abdominal disease (stage III-IV) and have a 5-year survival of <20%, whereas patients diagnosed with cancer localized to the ovary have a >90% 5-year survival. Clinically, tumors often involve the ovary and omentum, with diffuse intraperitoneal metastases and malignant ascites. Ovarian cancer metastasis results from numerous intraperitoneal adhesive events, suggesting that carcinoma cell integrins regulate subsequent invasive or metastatic behavior (2Wong A.S. Auersperg N.

Our previous studies demonstrated that expression of a constitutively active mutant form of the EGFR (EGFRvIII) in ovarian cancer cells led to reduction in integrin α2 surface expression, defects in cell spreading, and disruption of focal adhesions.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9280-9286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the course of those studies we observed that integrin α2 and the wild type (wt) EGF receptor were co-localized when EGFRvIII activity was inhibited; therefore we decided to investigate potential regulation of integrin α2 by ligand-activated EGF receptor in ovarian tumor cells. Here we report that EGF induces transient internalization of integrin α2, but not integrin β1. In the absence of ligand, integrin α2 interacts with the EGF receptor based on co-localization, co-immunoprecipitation, and chemical cross-linking studies. Following EGF stimulation, integrin α2 and EGF receptor interaction was disrupted and they were internalized by distinct pathways. EGF receptor activation promoted integrin α2 internalization via a caveolae/lipid raft-mediated, rather than the clathrin-dependent, endocytic pathway. Furthermore, internalized integrin α2 was localized to Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Based on these findings, we propose that activated EGF receptor down-regulates surface integrin α2 by a caveolae/raft-mediated endocytic pathway and presents a novel mechanism for EGF-dependent regulation of integrins. Cell Culture and Treatment—Ovarian carcinoma cell line OVCA 433 was generously provided by Dr. Robert Bast Jr., MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, and grown as described previously (29Ning Y. Zeineldin R. Liu Y. Rosenberg M. Stack M.S. Hudson L.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9280-9286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For experiments involving EGF (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA), OVCA 433 cell lines were placed into minimal essential medium containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 24 h prior to growth factor addition as described previously (29Ning Y. Zeineldin R. Liu Y. Rosenberg M. Stack M.S. Hudson L.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9280-9286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Chemical Attachment of Fluorescent Tags to GM1 Gangliosides—Alexa Fluor 488 hydrazide-conjugated gangliosides were prepared via a modified adaptation of reaction methods previously described (30Spiegel S. Kassis S. Wilchek M. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Burns A.R. Frankel D.J. Buranda T. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 1081-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Bovine brain gangliosides (1 mg/ml) were suspended in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, with 1 mm sodium meta-periodate. The oxidation reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min on ice. The vesicle suspension was then purified and concentrated by ultrafiltration in the same buffer using YM-30 Microcon centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), repeating five times to remove the sodium meta-periodate. 10 mm Alexa Fluor 488 hydrazide was added to the oxidized GM1 and allowed to react with agitation for 2 h at room temperature. The fluorescent GM1 conjugates were freed of unreacted dye by repeated pelleting and resuspension in PBS buffer as described above until the supernatant was optically clear. The labeled GM1 was dried under vacuum and stored as a powder under nitrogen at -20 °C. Antibodies—The mouse monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of integrin α2 (catalogue numbers 555668 or 611016), Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-integrin α2 (number 55566), and mouse anti-transferrin receptor (TfR) (number 555534) were purchased from BD Biosciences. The mouse anti-EGFR (number MS311) was obtained from Lab vision/Neomarkers (Fremont, CA), and sheep anti-wtEGFR (number 06–129) was obtained from Upstate USA, Inc. (Charlottesville, VA). Goat anti-clathrin (number C8034) was purchased from Sigma. The rabbit polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 (sc-894), anti-wtEGFR (sc-120), and β-tubulin (sc-9104) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The rabbit anti-58K (ab5820) and anti-GRP94 (ab3674) were obtained from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Chicken anti-Rab 7 was generously provided by Dr. Angela Wandinger-Ness, Dept. of Pathology, UNM School of Medicine. The rabbit polyclonal against the intracellular domain of integrin α2 (AB1936), mouse anti-integrin β1 (CBL 481), fluorescein isothiocyanate (AP265F) and Cy3 (AP192C)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Cy3 (AP184C)-conjugated anti-sheep IgG and rhodamine (AP182R) and Cy5 (AP182S)-conjugated anti-rabbit and Cy5-conjugated anti-goat (AP180S) antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—OVCA 433 cells were treated with 25 nm EGF and fixed with freshly prepared 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde in PBS (137 mmol/liter NaCl, 2.7 mmol/liter KCl, 8.1 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mmol/liter KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.8 mmol/liter MgCl2 and 0.18 mmol/liter CaCl2 for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. For dual staining, fixed cells were incubated with mouse anti-integrin α2, or rabbit anti-integrin α2 and sheep anti-EGFR, or mouse anti-EGFR and chicken anti-Rab 7, or mouse anti-TfR overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS, samples were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, anti-sheep IgG or anti-rabbit IgG, and the Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, anti-sheep IgG or anti-chicken IgG. For triple staining, fixed cells were incubated with mouse anti-integrin α2, sheep anti-wtEGFR, and rabbit anti-caveolin-1 or goat anti-clathrin and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3-conjugated antisheep IgG and Cy5-conjugated anti-rabbit or goat IgG antibodies. For GM1 staining, fixed cells were incubated with mouse anti-integrin α2 or mouse anti-EGFR, and then samples were incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. After washing three times with PBS, 150 nm Alexa 488-GM1 was added for 30 min at 37 °C. For Golgi and ER marker staining, OVCA 433 cells were fixed with 70% methanol/30% acetone (-20 °C) for 10 min at room temperature and incubated with rabbit anti-58K or anti-GRP94 and mouse anti-integrin α2 overnight at 4 °C; fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were added to sample. Confocal images were acquired at room temperature using a Zeiss LSM510 system equipped with argon and HeNe lasers for excitation at 488 nm (green), 543 nm (red), and 633 nm (blue). Samples were viewed with the 63 × 1.4 oil immersion objective lens. Cross-linking Assay—Cells were treated as described in the figure legends, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with 2 mm 3,3′ dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (Pierce) in PBS at 23 °C for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9% (w/vol) NaCl, and 0.1 m glycine. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and collected for further analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm NaVO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C and clarified at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants of cell lysates were precleared by incubation with 100 μl of a 50/50 protein A agarose bead suspension overnight at 4 °C. After preclearing, sample supernatant was collected following centrifugation and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of protein A beads and 5 μl/500 μg sample of either rabbit anti-wtEGFR, rabbit anti caveolin-1, or rabbit anti-integrin α2 overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific rabbit IgG was used as a control. The beads were washed once with lysis buffer and four times with buffer without detergent and then suspended in 50 μl of 2 × loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, and 0.1% Bromphenol blue). For immunoblot analysis, total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (10 mmol/liter Tris, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, pH 8.0) and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, probed with rabbit anti-EGFR, rabbit anti-integrin α2, rabbit anti-caveolin-1, or β-tubulin, washed three times with TBS and 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. Flow Cytometry—Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and harvested with trypsin-EDTA. 106 cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/DPBS for 10 min at 4 °C, incubated with primary antibody mouse PE-conjugated anti-integrin α2 or mouse PE-conjugated anti-wtEGFR for 50 min at 4 °C, and washed twice with DPBS. Additional control samples included cells without antibody, mouse anti-integrin β1 and primary antibody-blocked control. Cells were incubated with non-PE-conjugated primary antibody, either mouse anti-integrin α2, anti-integrin β1, or mouse anti-wtEGFR for 30 min at 4 °C, washed and then mouse PE-conjugated anti-integrin α2, β1, or mouse PE-conjugated anti-wtEGFR were added and samples incubated for 50 min at 4 °C. Cells were pelleted and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of DPBS. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer (Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Mean fluorescence intensity for three independent experiments is shown, and error bars represent ± S.D. Activated EGF Receptor Initiates Transient Internalization of Integrin α2—We reported previously that integrin α2 was dynamically modulated by activity of the constitutively active EGF receptor mutant EGFRvIII in an ovarian tumor cell line, OVCA 433 (29Ning Y. Zeineldin R. Liu Y. Rosenberg M. Stack M.S. Hudson L.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9280-9286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To establish whether ligand-stimulated EGF receptor also modulates integrin α2, we examined integrin α2 localization and protein expression after EGF treatment. As shown in Fig. 1A, integrin α2 displayed cell surface localization before EGF treatment, and after addition of ligand, integrin α2 surface staining intensity became more diffuse and of diminished intensity. The cell surface localization of integrin α2 was largely restored within 4 h of EGF treatment (Fig. 1A). This result is supported by flow cytometry to detect cell surface integrin α2 and integrin β1 levels (Fig. 1B) and immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1C). Cell surface integrin α2 expression was decreased by 32% within 30 min and returned to control levels by 24 h (Fig. 1B). This response differed from that of the EGF receptor, which was persistently down-regulated in the presence of ligand (Fig. 1B). A similar decrease and recovery of total integrin α2 protein levels was detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1C). The recovery of cell surface integrin α2 did not require new protein synthesis. There were no significant differences in integrin α2 surface levels in cells treated with or without cycloheximide, and integrin α2 surface expression in cycloheximide-treated cells was 90% of untreated control after 6 h of EGF treatment. In contrast to integrin α2, cell surface integrin β1 expression was not significantly altered as a consequence of EGF receptor activation by mutation (29Ning Y. Zeineldin R. Liu Y. Rosenberg M. Stack M.S. Hudson L.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9280-9286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or ligand (Fig. 1B). Association of Integrin α2 and EGF Receptor in Unstimulated Cells—Physical association between integrin α2β1 and the EGF receptor at intercellular adhesion sites has been reported in A431 cells (18Yu X. Miyamoto S. Mekada E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy of OVCA 433 cells immunostained for EGF receptor and integrin α2 reveals co-localization prior to EGF treatment (Fig. 2A). After EGF treatment, both EGF receptor and integrin α2 were rapidly internalized, but no longer co-localized (Fig. 2A). Co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking approaches were used to determine whether the apparent co-localization represented biochemical interaction between the EGF receptor and integrin α2. In OVCA 433 cell lysates, anti-integrin α2 antibodies immunoprecipitated the EGF receptor, and conversely anti-EGF receptor antibodies immunoprecipitated integrin α2 (Fig. 2B) before EGF treatment. This interaction was greatly diminished within 10 min of EGF receptor activation (Fig. 2B), which was consistent with results obtained by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2A). These findings support the conclusion that the EGF receptor and integrin α2 were associated before EGF treatment. EGF-stimulated Internalization of EGF Receptor and Integrin α2 through Distinct Pathways—Several mechanisms of integrin endocytosis have been reported (32Fabbri M. Di Meglio S. Gagliani M.C. Consonni E. Molteni R. Bender J.R. Tacchetti C. Pardi R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5793-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Berryman S. Clark S. Monaghan P. Jackson T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8519-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Powelka A.M. Sun J. Li J. Gao M. Shaw L.M. Sonnenberg A. Hsu V.W. Traffic. 2004; 5: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The trafficking of integrin αVβ6 and β1 has been reported to take place through an endosomal-mediated endocytic recycling pathway, but integrin αLβ2 was internalized and rapidly recycled upon chemoattractant stimulation via a clathrin-independent, cholesterol-sensitive pathway. Because integrin α2 is initially associated with the EGF receptor (Fig. 2), which is endocytosed primarily via clathrin-dependent mechanisms (35Marmor M.D. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2057-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and αvβ6, β1 integrins have been reported to be internalized via clathrin-dependent mechanisms (33Berryman S. Clark S. Monaghan P. Jackson T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8519-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 34Powelka A.M. Sun J. Li J. Gao M. Shaw L.M. Sonnenberg A. Hsu V.W. Traffic. 2004; 5: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), we investigated whether integrin α2 is internalized by the clathrin endocytic pathway. Several endocytic markers (clathrin, Rab7, TfR) of clathrin-dependent internalization were used to examine integrin α2 trafficking in response to EGF. Untreated and treated OVCA 433 cells were triple-labeled using antibodies recognizing the EGF receptor, integrin α2, and clathrin. As shown in Fig. 3A, EGF receptor co-localized with clathrin; however, there was no detectable co-localization between clathrin and integrin α2. Rab7 protein belongs to a superfamily of small molecular weight GTPases associated with late endosomes. Rab7 regulates the later stages of the endocytic pathway for a number of proteins, including the TfR, a marker of recycling endosomes that undergoes multiple rounds of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and reemergence at the cell surface (36Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 37Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Dual staining confocal microscopy was used to detect localization of EGF receptor or integrin α2 with Rab 7 (Fig. 3B) or TfR (Fig. 3C). As expected, there was punctate staining of EGF receptor with Rab 7 (Fig. 3B, arrows) or TfR, but no co-localization of Rab 7 (Fig. 3B) or TfR (Fig. 3C) with integrin α2 was detected. These findings suggest that EGF-stimulated internalization of integrin α2 does not occur through a clathrin-dependent pathway and prompted investigations of alternative mechanisms. Recent studies have reported that protein kinase C-dependent integrin α2 internalization and C8-LacCer-stimulated β1 integrin internalization occur via caveolar endocytosis (38Upla P. Marjomaki V. Kankaanpaa P. Ivaska J. Hyypia T. Van Der Goot F.G. Heino J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Sharma D.K. Brown J.C. Cheng Z. Holicky E.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8233-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possibility of a caveolae-dependent mechanism for EGF-mediated integrin α2 internalization. Caveolin-1 is a hallmark protein for caveolae and caveosomes, so interactions between caveolin-1 and integrin α2 were investigated using confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation approaches. In the absence of EGF, caveolin-1 co-localized with integrin α2 and EGF receptor (Fig. 4A, upper panels). Thirty minutes after EGF addition, caveolin-1 co-localized with integrin α2, but not the EGF receptor (Fig. 4B, lower panels). We confirmed the apparent co-localization of integrin α2 with caveolin-1 through co-immunoprecipitation and chemical cross-linking techniques. Before EGF treatment, caveolin-1 was associated with the EGF receptor and integrin α2 (Fig. 4B). After 10 min of EGF stimulation, caveolin-1 and EGF receptor were no longer associated but interactions between caveolin-1 and integrin α2 were largely retained (Fig. 4, B and C). Interaction between caveolin-1 and integrin α2 remained apparent 30 min after EGF exposure (data not shown). Caveolae are associated with lipid raft fractions that concentrate the ganglioside GM1, and GM1 serves as a marker for caveolae-like rafts (40Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 41Pang H. Le P.U. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As further confirmation that integrin α2 is present in caveolar rafts, we examined localization of the EGF receptor or integrin α2 with fluorescently labeled Alexa 488-GM1. The results were comparable with those obtained for caveolin-1 (Fig. 4A) in which both EGF receptor and integrin α2 co-localized with GM1 before EGF treatment (Fig. 5) but only integrin α2 was associated with GM1 after EGF treatment (Fig. 5). Based on these findings, we conclude that integrin α2 is concentrated in a subset of GM1-rich caveolae-like rafts and, in response to EGF, internalized by a caveolae-mediated endocytic pathway. Internalized Integrin α2 Is Targeted to the Golgi Apparatus and the ER—The caveosome is an endocytic compartment that is distinguished from the early endosome by neutral pH and by the presence of caveolin-1 (42Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). SV40 and cholera toxin are internalized by caveosome-mediated mechanisms and then sorted to Golgi and ER, respectively (43Nichols B.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 44Norkin L.C. Anderson H.A. Wolfrom S.A. Oppenheim A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5156-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To investigate the fate of integrin α2 after internalization, we used the Golgi marker 58K and ER marker GRP94. OVCA 433 cells were treated with EGF for 30 min and labeled with 58K or GPR94 and integrin α2. Co-localization of integrin α2 and 58K or GPR94 was observed in response to incubation with EGF (Fig. 6). These data suggest that internalized integrin α2 has been delivered to Golgi apparatus and ER. Functional interactions between integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases through reciprocal activation and cooperation in signal transduction have been described (45Christofori G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2318-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Often these interactions occur in an integrin-, receptor-, and cell type-dependent manner. Based on co-immunoprecipitation studies, the EGF receptor forms complexes with integrinα6β4 (24Mariotti A. Kedeshian P.A. Dans M. Curatola A.M. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and integrin α2 (18Yu X. Miyamoto S. Mekada E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a close linkage between EGF receptor and the functions of these integrins. The integrin α2 cytoplasmic domain is required for EGF-stimulated migration (27Klekotka P.A. Santoro S.A. Wang H. Zutter M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32353-32361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Klekotka P.A. Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9503-9511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and integrin α2 is reportedly required for serum-independent activation of the EGF receptor at sites of cell:cell contact in A431 cells (18Yu X. Miyamoto S. Mekada E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2139-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reported previously that a constitutively active form of the EGF receptor EGFRvIII down-regulated integrin α2 protein, and the loss of integrin α2 was accompanied by aberrant spreading and focal adhesion formation on type I collagen (29Ning Y. Zeineldin R. Liu Y. Rosenberg M. Stack M.S. Hudson L.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9280-9286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Inhibition of EGFRvIII catalytic activity restored integrin α2 expression, cell spreading, and assembly of focal adhesions, suggesting that EGF receptor kinase activity regulated integrin α2 functions. In this study we find that ligand-activated EGF receptor causes transient internalization of integrin α2 through a caveolae/raft-mediated mechanism. There are many examples of integrin trafficking from the cell membrane with evidence for selective recycling of specific integrins and internalization by different mechanisms (46Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Clathrin-dependent mechanisms have been described and integrins are involved in viral entry through clathrin-mediated pathways (33Berryman S. Clark S. Monaghan P. Jackson T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8519-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 46Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 47Imelli N. Meier O. Boucke K. Hemmi S. Greber U.F. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3089-3098Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). αvβ5 is reportedly recruited to clathrin-coated pits, and integrin β1 and L1 adhesion molecule complexes are internalized by clathrin-dependent endocytosis (46Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 48Panicker A.K. Buhusi M. Erickson A. Maness P.F. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the observed association between integrin α2 and the EGF receptor before ligand addition, integrin α2 did not gain entry through the clathrin-dependent pathway with the EGF receptor in ovarian tumor cells (Fig. 2). Clathrin-independent and caveolae-mediated internalization of integrins has been described for certain integrins, including integrin α2β1 (38Upla P. Marjomaki V. Kankaanpaa P. Ivaska J. Hyypia T. Van Der Goot F.G. Heino J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Sharma D.K. Brown J.C. Cheng Z. Holicky E.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8233-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Caveolae are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich smooth invaginations of the plasma membrane that partition into raft fractions and whose expression is associated with caveolin-1 (49Nabi I.R. Le P.U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 50Galvez B.G. Matias-Roman S. Yanez-Mo M. Vicente-Manzanares M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. Mol. Biol.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). A number of integrins, including αvβ3 and α5β1, associate with caveolin-1, and α2β1 redistributes to caveolae after integrin clustering (38Upla P. Marjomaki V. Kankaanpaa P. Ivaska J. Hyypia T. Van Der Goot F.G. Heino J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 46Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In studies using human osteosarcoma cells transfected with α2 integrin, integrin α2β1 was internalized into caveosome-like structures but direct interaction with caveolin-1 was not determined (38Upla P. Marjomaki V. Kankaanpaa P. Ivaska J. Hyypia T. Van Der Goot F.G. Heino J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We found co-localization and biochemical interaction between caveolin-1 and integrin α2 in resting and EGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 4) that persisted during integrin α2 internalization. Furthermore, integrin α2 internalized with GM1, which has been extensively used as a marker for glycolipid raft domains (40Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 41Pang H. Le P.U. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and is associated with caveolae (53Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 54Thyberg J. Lab. Investig. 2000; 80: 915-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that integrin α2 is concentrated in caveolar rafts and internalized by a caveolae-mediated endocytic pathway in response to EGF receptor activation. Caveolae do not appear to be involved in constitutive integrin endocytosis, but this internalization pathway can be activated by a variety of mechanisms (46Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Trafficking by caveolae is less well understood than other endocytic pathways, but it is stimulated by a number of viruses binding to certain integrins, including α2β1 or glycosphingolipids (42Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms promote caveolar endocytosis, such as C8-LacCer or cholesterol (39Sharma D.K. Brown J.C. Cheng Z. Holicky E.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8233-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), leading to rapid internalization of β1 integrins and protein kinase C-dependent internalization of α2β1 (38Upla P.

Our studies indicate that EGF receptor activation is an additional mechanism to stimulate caveolar trafficking pathways. Recent studies (55Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6967-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have shown that a variety of cell surface receptors, including the EGF receptor, are present in caveolae and lipid rafts. A caveolin binding motif within the kinase domain of the EGF receptor mediates the interaction of EGF receptor with caveolin-1 (56Abulrob A. Giuseppin S. Andrade M.F. McDermid A. Moreno M.

In human glioblastoma cell lines, EGF receptor rapidly moves out of caveolae domains in response to EGF and then internalizes and degrades via a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway (56Abulrob A. Giuseppin S. Andrade M.F. McDermid A. Moreno M. Stanimirovic D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6967-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 58Stang E. Johannessen L.E. Knardal S.L. Madshus I.H. J.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies we detected co-localization and biochemical association between the EGF receptor, integrin α2, and caveolin-1 without EGF treatment. After EGF binding, interaction between the EGF receptor and integrin α2 or caveolin-1 was no longer detected and EGF receptor was located in clathrin-associated vesicles (Figs. 3 and 4). Although the EGF receptor was degraded (Fig. 2), integrin α2 was trafficked to the Golgi apparatus and ER and surface levels of integrin α2 were restored to near control levels within 4–6 h after EGF treatment. This targeting of integrin α2 is consistent with findings that cholera toxin and SV40 are delivered to the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively, following caveolae-mediated internalization (42Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 49Nabi I.R. Le P.U. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Trafficking is a well recognized mechanism to modulate signaling of receptors such as the EGF receptor (61Wiley H.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar); similarly, integrin endocytosis is understood to regulate cell function (42Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 46Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Inhibition of integrin recycling interferes with cell spreading and migration, and integrin internalization is proposed to play a role in speed and directionality of migrating cells (46Caswell P.T. Norman J.C. Traffic. 2006; 7: 14-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Our findings that ligand-activated EGF receptor results in transient integrin α2 internalization and that constitutively activated EGFRvIII leads to persistent integrin α2 down-regulation (29Ning Y. Zeineldin R. Liu Y. Rosenberg M. Stack M.S. Hudson L.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9280-9286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) suggest a novel mechanism by which EGF receptor activation may regulate cell behavior and ovarian cancer metastasis.

However, their mechanistic roles in these processes remain largely unknown. We applied 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate on the wild type (WT) and the Klk8 gene-disrupted (Klk8-/-) mouse skin, inducing keratinocyte proliferation similar to the human psoriatic lesion. Klk8 mRNA as well as Klk6 and Klk7 mRNA were up-regulated after 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate application in the WT mice. In contrast, Klk8-/- mice showed minimum increases of Klk6 and Klk7 transcripts, the proteins, and enzymatic activities. Relative to the WT, the Klk8-/- skin showed less proliferation and an increase in the number of cell layers in the stratum corneum. However, overexpression of Klk8 by adenovirus vector in knock-out keratinocytes did not result in an increase in Klk6 or Klk7 mRNA. The inefficient cleavage of adhesion molecules DSG1 and CDSN in Klk8-/- skin contributes to a delay in corneocyte shedding, resulting in the hyperkeratosis phenotype. We propose that in psoriatic lesion, KLK8 modulates hyperproliferation and prevents excessive hyperkeratosis by shedding the corneocytes.

We propose that in psoriatic lesion, KLK8 modulates hyperproliferation and prevents excessive hyperkeratosis by shedding the corneocytes. A main function of the skin is to serve as a permeability barrier for keeping moisture in our bodies and to protect physical, chemical, and biological materials entering from the outside. The outermost corneocytes are shed from the epidermal surface as a result of proteolytic degradation of corneodesmosomes by epidermal proteases during the desquamation process. It is important to maintain a balance between proliferation of epidermal cells and shedding of outermost layers. Several stratum corneum proteases are essential for the maintenance of structural and functional barrier of the epidermis and are also involved in keratinocyte desquamation (1Zeeuwen P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Human tissue kallikreins comprise of a subgroup of 15 serine proteases encoded by a tightly clustered multigene family on chromosome 19q13.4 (2Yousef G. Chang A. Scorilas A. Diamandis E. Biochem.

This region is also synthenic to the locus on mouse chromosome 7 where the murine kallikrein gene family cluster is localized (5Evans B.A. Drinkwater C.C. Richards R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8027-8034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse serine proteases share a high degree of sequence and structural similarity with human homologues (2Yousef G.

In addition, we use terms Klk1-Klk15 for mouse homologues of human genes and mK1-mK15 for the products from Klk genes following the nomenclature of kallikreins (6Diamandis E.P. Yousef G.M. Clin. Chem. 2002; 48: 1198-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). KLKs have been shown to play critical roles in desquamation as recently reported (7Brattsand M. Stefansson K. Lundh C. Haasum Y.

Pro-hK7 can be activated by hK5, and pro-hK5 can be activated by hK14 and hK5 itself (7Brattsand M. Stefansson K. Lundh C. Haasum Y. Egelrud T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 124: 198-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression and activation of hK7 are known to increase in psoriasis and itchy dermatitis (9Hansson L. Backman A. Ny A. Edlund M. Ekholm E. Ekstrand Hammarstrom B. Tornell J.

Res. 1999; 291: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). KLK8, also known as neuropsin, has been shown to have a trypsin-like activity (11Shimizu C. Yoshida S. Shibata M. Kato K. Momota Y. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka T. Midorikawa R. Kamachi T. Kawabe A. Shiosaka S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11189-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In human and mouse skin, hK8 and mK8 are localized from the upper stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum. Increases in KLK8 transcripts and protein were observed in human skin diseases, such as psoriasis vulgaris, lichen planus, and atopic dermatitis (12Kuwae K. Matsumoto-Miyai K. Yoshida S. Sadayama T. Yoshikawa K. Hosokawa K. Shiosaka S. J. Clin. Pathol. 2002; 55: 235-241Google Scholar, 13Komatsu N. Saijoh K. Sidiropoulos M. Tsai B. Levesque M. Elliott M. Takehara K. Diamandis E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These results led to the hypothesis that hK8 is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases. There was no remarkable histological difference between the epidermis of wild-type (WT) and Klk8 gene-null (Klk8-/-) mice. However, Klk8-/- mice showed delayed recovery of the epidermis from the UVB-induced inflammation (14Kirihara T. Matsumoto-Miyai K. Nakamura Y. Sadayama T. Yoshida S. Shiosaka S. Br. J. Dermatol. 2003; 149: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that Klk8 mRNA was induced by an external stimulus, such as the application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which causes epidermal proliferation and hyperkeratosis like psoriasis of human skin (15Kitayoshi H. Inoue N. Kuwae K. Chen Z. Sato H. Ohta T. Hosokawa K. Itami S. Yoshikawa K. Yoshida S. Shiosaka S. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1999; 291: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used TPA to compare the reaction of WT and Klk8-/- mouse skin. Our results suggest that mK8 is involved in desquamation through a protease cascade reaction leading to the degradation of DSG1 and CDSN. Mice and TPA Application Model—All of the experiments were performed with Klk8-/- mice with C57BL/6 genetic background (16Hirata A. Yoshida S. Inoue N. Matsumoto-Miyai K. Ninomiya A. Taniguchi M. Matsuyama T. Kato K. Iizasa H. Kataoka Y. Yoshida N. Shiosaka S. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 17: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and WT C57BL/6 mice. All of the experimental protocols were carried out according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Asahikawa Medical College. The shaved dorsal skin surface was treated once topically with 10 nm TPA (BIOMOL Research Laboratories) in 200 μl of ethanol. The control mice were treated with 200 μl of ethanol. The mice were killed 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 5 days, and 7 days following the TPA treatments. The treated area of the dorsal skin was removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until use. RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated according to the TRIzol protocol (Invitrogen) and incubated with DNase (Promega) for RT-PCR. Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega), and PCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). The primers used were as follows: Klk8 forward sequence, CCCACTGCAAAAAACAGAAC; Klk8 reverse sequence, TGTCAGCTCCATTGCTGCT; Klk7 forward sequence, GCTGGACAAGGAGAAAGGATT; Klk7 reverse sequence, TGGTACTGACCCATTTTGCA; Klk6 forward sequence, CCCAGATACCATTCAGTGT; Klk6 reverse sequence, CGTGGGGGAGAACTGGATGT; β2-microglobulin forward sequence, TGCTACTCGGCGCTTCAGT; and β2-microglobulin reverse sequence, TATGTTCGGCTTCCCATTCT. Each reaction was performed at 30 cycles. Real time quantitative PCR was performed following the protocol described for a Light cycler SYBR green kit (Roche Applied Science). Histopathology—Quantification/counting of the number of cell layers in the stratum corneum was performed as previously reported (17Ya-Xian Z. Suetake T. Tagami H. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1999; 291: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5-μm fresh frozen sections were stained with 1% aqueous solution of safranin for 1 min and flooded with 2% potassium hydroxide aqueous solution. The number of the corneocyte layers was counted at six randomly selected locations/slide. For immunohistochemistry, fresh frozen sections (5 μm thick) were incubated with 0.3% H2O2 for 5 min to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity followed by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min. The sections were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies (Abs) used were anti-mK8 Ab (Medical & Biological Laboratories) diluted at 1:1000, anti-mK6 Ab (18Terayama R. Bando Y. Jiang Y.P. Mitrovic B. Yoshida S. Neurosci. Lett. 2005; 382: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) diluted at 1:2000, anti-Ki67 Ab (Dako Cytomation) diluted at 1:100, anti-DSG1 Ab (BD Bioscience) diluted at 1:100, and anti-CDSN Ab (19Ishida-Yamamoto A. Simon M. Kishibe M. Miyauchi Y. Takahashi H. Yoshida S. O'brien T. Serre G. Iizuka H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), diluted at 1:200. Primary antibodies were detected using a peroxidase or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution). A Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) was used for the detection of peroxidase activity. For proliferation assay, fresh frozen sections (5 μm thick) were incubated with anti-Ki67 Ab (Dako Cytomation) diluted at 1:100 for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibody was detected using a Vectastain Elite ABC kit. The number of the Ki67-positive cells was counted at four randomly selected locations/slide. Western Blotting—The incised mouse skin was incubated with 10 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at 56 °C. The epidermis was mechanically separated from the dermis and homogenized in a sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% glycerol, 1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), followed by sonication on ice five times for 3 s and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as the epidermal extract. Proteins of the epidermal extract were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were incubated with one of the following antibodies: anti-mK6 Ab, anti-DSG1 Ab (BD Biosciences), anti-CDSN Ab, and anti-α-tubulin Ab (Abcam). The final detection was performed with 1:2000 dilutions of peroxidaseconjugated secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies and visualized using the ECL Advance Western blot detection kit (Amersham Biosciences Bioscience) and luminescent Image Analyzer LAS-3000 (Fuji). Protease Activity Assays in Mouse Epidermis—The TPA-applied, shaved back skin was incubated in 1 m NaCl at 4 °C for 72 h for separating at the dermal-epidermal junction. Each epidermis was homogenized with the extraction buffer containing 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5mm EDTA and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The proteolytic activity of the supernatant was measured as described previously (20Momota Y. Yoshida S. Ito J. Shibata M. Kato K. Sakurai K. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 21Matsumoto-Miyai K. Ninomiya A. Yamasaki H. Tamura H. Nakamura Y. Shiosaka S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7727-7736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, 10 μg of protein of the epidermal extract was incubated with 100 mm synthetic substrate Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA (VPR-MCA) (Peptide Institute), Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA (FSR-MCA) (Peptide Institute), and Meo-Suc-Arg-Pro-Tyr-pNA-HCl (RPY-pNA) (Chromogenix AB) in a total volume of 1 ml at 37 °C for 2 h with shaking. All of the reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 mm PMSF. Released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured on a F-4500 fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi) set at 370 nm for excitation and 460 nm for emission. Released pNA was measured on photometer Ultraspec 2100 pro (Amersham Biosciences) set at 405-nm wavelength. All of the measurements were performed in duplicate. In Situ Zymography—In situ zymography was performed using 5-μm fresh frozen sections as previous described (22Fluhr J.W. Mao-Qiang M. Brown B.E. Hachem J.P. Moskowitz D.G. Demerjian M. Haftek M. Serre G. Crumrine D. Mauro T.M. Elias P.M. Feingold K.R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 123: 140-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sections were washed with 2% Tween 20 in deionized water and incubated with 2 μg/μl BOPY-FL-conjugated casein (Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 2 h. PMSF (1 mm) was added to some sections as negative controls. After washing, the sections were examined using fluorescence microscopy. Construction of Adenovirus Vectors and Transfection in Klk8-/- Mouse Keratinocytes—The cDNA fragment encoding Klk8 was cloned into an expression cosmid cassette designated pAxCAwt, whose foreign gene expression is strongly induced by a CAG promoter. The generated cosmid was used as a transfer vector for adenovirus preparation. For obtaining recombinant adenovirus (AdKlk8), we used Takara adenovirus expression kit, followed by CsCl gradient centrifugation (23Kanegae Y. Makimura M. Saito I. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Viral titers (plaque forming unit/ml) were determined using a plaque-forming assay in HEK 293 cells (23Kanegae Y. Makimura M. Saito I. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). An identical virus, lacking expression of the transgene, but expressing green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) was used as a negative control. Klk8-/- newborn keratinocytes were isolated from 2-4-day-old mice. Primary cultures were initiated and maintained in keratinocyte growth medium containing epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), and bovine pituitary extract (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Keratinocytes were grown until confluent and were infected by adding AdKlk8 or the control virus, AdGFP, to the culture medium from 3 to 30 multiplicity of infection (MOI) ratios. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by adding fresh keratinocyte growth medium and incubating at 37 °C for 48 h. The expression of Klk8 mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR, and mK8 was detected by Western blot analysis with 10 μl of culture medium. After incubation, total RNA was isolated, and quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described above. Statistical Analysis—Student’s t test was used for statistical analysis. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Klk8 mRNA Was Up-regulated after TPA Treatment—We applied TPA on the dorsal skin of WT mice to induce psoriasiform epidermis and investigated the change of Klk8 mRNA with RT-PCR. Klk8 was weakly expressed before TPA application. The expression of Klk8 mRNA was markedly increased after TPA treatment (Fig. 1A). Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that Klk8 mRNA was up-regulated 5-fold, peaking at 48 h after TPA treatment, whereas no up-regulation was observed in control mice treated with ethanol (Fig. 1B). Weak mK8-like immunoreactivity was detected in the stratum granulosum without TPA treatment (Fig. 1C). The mK8-like immunoreactivity was increased in the upper stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum up to 48 h after TPA application (Fig. 1, D-F). Number of Proliferating Cells and Cell Layers of the Stratum Corneum of the WT and Klk8-/- Skin after TPA Treatment—We compared morphologic change of the skin of WT and Klk8-/- mice after TPA treatment. TPA induced acanthosis and hyperkeratosis in the dorsal skin of both genotypes (Figs. 2, C and D, and 3A). TPA-treated epidermal keratinocytes in both genotypes were strongly positive for Ki67, a hyperproliferation marker (Fig. 2, C and D). The number of Ki67-positive cells peaked at 48 h after TPA application. WT skin showed significantly more Ki67-positive cells at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 7 days (Fig. 2E). We next compared the number of cell layers of the stratum corneum. The number of cell layers of the stratum corneum in Klk8-/- mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice without TPA application. Five and 7 days after TPA application, the difference became even more prominent (Fig. 3). Therefore, we hypothesized that Klk8 is involved in proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes and corneocyte shedding at the epidermal surface with or without TPA application.FIGURE 3Number of cell layers of the stratum corneum after TPA application of WT and Klk8-/- mice.

RT-PCR revealed that Klk6 and Klk7 mRNAs were weakly expressed before TPA application in both genotypes. Although Klk6 and Klk7 mRNA of the WT epidermis were markedly increased after TPA application, the increase of these mRNAs in the Klk8-/- epidermis was significantly weaker (Fig. 4A). Using the quantitative RT-PCR, we found that Klk6 mRNA of both genotypes was increased, peaking at 24 h after TPA application. However, the fold increase in Klk6 mRNA was significantly different between the genotypes. Klk6 mRNA was increased up to 35 times in WT, whereas Klk8-/- mice showed only 4-fold increase (Fig. 4B). Klk7 mRNA was up-regulated 2.4-fold at 24 h after TPA application in WT mice, whereas no significant change was observed in Klk8-/- mice (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that Klk8 is involved in the up-regulation of both Klk6 and Klk7 mRNA after TPA treatment. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of mK6 was weak in the epidermis but was high in the hair follicles in both genotypes (Fig. 5, A and J). After TPA application, mK6 of WT mice was highly expressed from the stratum granulosum to the stratum corneum (Fig. 5, D and G). mK8 was also expressed from the upper layer of stratum spinosum to the stratum corneum (Fig. 5, B, E, and H). Merged images revealed that the expression of mK8 partially overlapped with that of mK6 (Fig. 5, F and I). In contrast, mK6 was weakly expressed in the epidermis of Klk8-/- mice even after TPA application (Fig. 5, K and L). Western blot analysis detected the increased 30-kDa form of mK6 at 24 h after TPA application in both genotypes (Fig. 5M). In WT mice, the 28-kDa form was detected at 72 h after TPA application but not in Klk8-/- mice. This shorter fragment may represent active mK6 from which pro-sequence had been cleaved off. We tried but failed to detect mK7 by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis using anti-mK7 antibody (Santa Cruz). This may be due to relatively weak expression of mK7 in the control epidermis of mice (9Hansson L. Backman A. Ny A. Edlund M. Ekholm E. Ekstrand Hammarstrom B. Tornell J. Wallbrandt P. Wennbo H.

Protease Activity Assays in the Epidermis after TPA Application—To investigate the difference of protease activity between WT and Klk8-/- mice, we measured proteolytic activity of epidermal extraction toward VPR-MCA and FSR-MCA, both of which were shown to be good substrates of mK8 and mK6 (11Shimizu C. Yoshida S. Shibata M. Kato K. Momota Y. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka T. Midorikawa R. Kamachi T. Kawabe A. Shiosaka S. J. Biol.

Elliott M. Takehara K. Diamandis E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Protease activity to VPR-MCA of WT epidermis gradually increased upon TPA treatment peaking at 72 h, whereas the activity to FSR-MCA increased, peaking at 48 h. The proteolytic activities to VPR-MCA and FSR-MCA of the untreated Klk8-/- epidermis were comparable with that of WT epidermis. However, upon TPA treatment, these protease activities in Klk8-/- epidermis increased only slightly and were significantly lower than those of the WT (Fig. 6, A and B). In WT epidermis, the proteolytic activity toward RPY-pNA was increased, peaking at 24 h after TPA application. In contrast, Klk8-/- epidermis showed minimal change (Fig. 6C), consistent with the change of Klk7 mRNA (Fig. 4, A and C). In situ zymography also showed that the protease activity of Klk8-/- mice at 72 h was lower than that of WT (Fig. 6, D and E). Released fluorescence from casein in both genotypes was detected from the stratum granulosum to stratum corneum, where mK8 and mK6 were colocalized (Fig. 5I). PMSF, a serine protease inhibitor, inhibited proteolysis activity toward casein in both genotypes (Fig. 6, F and G). These results suggest that serine protease activity of the Klk8-/- mouse epidermis remained low even after treatment with TPA. Overexpression of mK8 Did Not Up-regulate Klk6 or KLK7 mRNA Expression—To investigate whether mK8 itself can up-regulate other kallikrein genes, especially Klk6 and Klk7, we transfected primary keratinocyte cultures from the skin Klk8-/- with adenoviral vectors containing Klk8 cDNA (AdKlk8) or control AdGFP. Forty-eight hours after the transfection, the total RNA was isolated, and quantitative RT-PCR was performed. The expression of mK8 was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 7, A and B). Klk8 expression was prominent in AdKlk8-transfected cells compared with WT keratinocytes as well as Klk8-/- keratinocytes without transfection. Klk6 mRNA was not significantly changed after transfection of Klk8 or GFP compared with Klk8-/- keratinocytes without transfection (p value between 0 and 3 MOI of AdKlk8 was 0.30). Klk7 mRNA was not significantly changed either (p value between 0 and 3 MOI of AdKlk8 was 0.067). Neither was there a difference in Klk6 or Klk7 mRNA between Klk8- and GFP-transfected keratinocytes (Fig. 7, C and D). Reduction in DSG1 and CDSN Processing in Klk8-/- Mice—To address the possible molecular target of the Klk8-related proteases in corneocyte shedding, we investigated the changes of cohesion molecules of the stratum corneum, DSG1 and CDSN, by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. We used anti-DSG1 antibody, which detects the intracellular domain of DSG1, and anti-CDSN antibody, which detects both the mature and proteolyzed forms. Western blot analysis revealed that DSG1 was significantly reduced until 48 h after TPA application in WT epidermis (Fig. 8, A and B). In contrast, there was no significant reduction of DSG1 in Klk8-/- mice at 48 h. Immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of DSG1 at the lower layers of the stratum corneum was stronger at 48 h in Klk8-/- mice than in WT mice (Fig. 8, C and D). The expression of CDSN showed no difference between WT and Klk8-/- mice by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). However, Western blot analysis detected a 32-kDa fragment, which increased along with unprocessed 52- and 46-48-kDa fragments. The 32-kDa fragment is assumed to be a proteolyzed product by hK7, and the 46-48-kDa fragment is assumed to be a proteolyzed product by hK5 (8Caubet C. Jonca N. Brattsand M. Guerrin M. Bernard D.

Interestingly, the 32-kDa fragment changed following the Klk7 mRNA expression (Fig. 4C). TPA application increased 52- and 46-48-kDa forms to the same extent in WT and Klk8-/- mice. However, despite the prominent increase of 32-kDa form in WT epidermis, Klk8-/- mice epidermis showed much less increase after the TPA application (Fig. 8, E and F). Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by excessive but controlled hyperproliferation and inflammation. Up-regulation of hK8 has been reported in human psoriatic lesions (12Kuwae K. Matsumoto-Miyai K. Yoshida S. Sadayama T. Yoshikawa K. Hosokawa K. Shiosaka S. J. Clin. Pathol. 2002; 55: 235-241Google Scholar, 13Komatsu N. Saijoh K. Sidiropoulos M. Tsai B. Levesque M. Elliott M. Takehara K. Diamandis E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). TPA, an activator of protein kinase C, induces epidermal hyperplasia similar to psoriatic lesion. The present and a previous study showed that TPA increased the expression of Klk8 mRNA (Fig. 1) (15Kitayoshi H. Inoue N. Kuwae K. Chen Z. Sato H. Ohta T. Hosokawa K. Itami S. Yoshikawa K. Yoshida S. Shiosaka S. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1999; 291: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our study provides evidence that mK8 is involved in preventing hyperkeratosis. The number of cell layers of the stratum corneum of the Klk8-/- epidermis was significantly higher than that of the WT epidermis, and the difference was prominent after 72 h (Fig. 3B). UVB-radiated epidermis of Klk8-/- mice also showed significantly more thickening of the stratum corneum than that of WT after only 5 days (14Kirihara T. Matsumoto-Miyai K. Nakamura Y. Sadayama T. Yoshida S. Shiosaka S. Br. J. Dermatol. 2003; 149: 700-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to the function in shedding, mK8 may be involved in keratinocyte proliferation. WT skin had more proliferating cells before and after TPA application as compared with Klk8-/-. These results indicate that mK8 is involved in both proliferation of epidermis and corneocyte shedding. The molecular mechanism remains to be determined. However, hK8 and other kallikreins are also expressed in carcinoma cells (12Kuwae K. Matsumoto-Miyai K. Yoshida S. Sadayama T. Yoshikawa K. Hosokawa K. Shiosaka S. J. Clin. Pathol. 2002; 55: 235-241Google Scholar, 26Borgono C.A. Diamandis E.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 876-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). To address the possible involvement of other kallikreins in corneocyte shedding, we investigated the relationship of Klk8 and other Klks using Klk8-/- mice. We found that Klk8 is an important factor for inducing Klk6 and Klk7 (Fig. 4). Previous reports suggested that both hK6 and hK7 are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis (10Ekholm E. Egelrud T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1999; 291: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Komatsu N. Saijoh K. Sidiropoulos M. Tsai B. Levesque M. Elliott M. Takehara K. Diamandis E. J. Investig.

Cascade reactions of KLKs have been suggested to play a critical role in skin desquamation (7Brattsand M. Stefansson K. Lundh C. Haasum Y. Egelrud T. J. Investig.

In addition, at least eight kallikreins, including hK5, hK6, hK7, and hK8, are thought to be involved in desquamation cascade of the human skin (13Komatsu N. Saijoh K. Sidiropoulos M. Tsai B. Levesque M. Elliott M. Takehara K. Diamandis E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the present study, Klk8 mRNA showed parallel up-regulation with Klk6 and Klk7 mRNA after TPA treatment (Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4), raising the possibility that these enzymes function in an activation cascade. Double immunostaining revealed that mK8 was expressed earlier than mK6 during epidermal differentiation (Fig. 5, F and I). These expressions coincided with the proteolytic activity, namely, WT mice showed stronger proteolytic activity than Klk8-/- mice in the stratum granulosum to the stratum corneum (Fig. 6). However, Klk8 transfection to Klk8-/- keratinocytes did not up-regulate Klk6 or Klk7 mRNA, indicating that mK8 itself is not involved in the transcriptional regulation of Klk6 or Klk7 (Fig. 7). From these findings, we hypothesize that mK8 regulates and activates mK6 post-transcriptionally at the stratum granulosum. We also speculate that Klk6 and Klk7 are regulated by the differentiation status of keratinocytes and indirectly by mK8, possibly through affecting the differentiation status. Proteolytic activity for substrates of mK6 and mK8 of WT but not Klk8-/- mouse epidermis was gradually increased until 72 h (Fig. 6, A and B). At this time point, Klk8 and Klk6 mRNA and mK6 were decreased over the expression peaks (Figs. 1, 4, and 5). It can be assumed that even after mK8 has reached its expression peak, the activated forms of downstream proteases such as mK6 retain their proteolytic activities. This result again implies that mK8 is located in the upper stream of activation cascade. In the human skin, hK7 can be ascribed to a major chymotrypsin-like kallikrein (13Komatsu N. Saijoh K. Sidiropoulos M. Tsai B. Levesque M. Elliott M. Takehara K. Diamandis E. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Egelrud T. Regnier M. Sondell B. Shroot B. Schmidt R. Acta Derm. Venereol. 1993; 73: 181-184PubMed Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity to chymotryptic substrates in the WT epidermis was increased at 24 h (Fig. 6C), consistent with the expression of Klk7 mRNA (Fig. 4C). Another kallikrein, hK5 is a major component of the serine proteases of the human skin. We therefore tried, but failed, to detect Klk5 mRNA in the mouse skin (data not shown), suggesting that the expression of Klk5 in the mouse skin may be very low. In addition, there has been no report in the literature on the existence of Klk5 in the mouse skin. The primary mechanism of corneocyte shedding is the cleavage of corneodesmosomes. Therefore, we examined the changes of the molecules of corneodesmosomes. Western blot analysis showed the reduction of uncleaved DSG1 and the appearance of the cleaved CDSN fragment after TPA application in WT mice (Fig. 8), suggesting that mK8 and/or relating enzymes cleaved these corneodesmosome proteins. The same pattern of changes of DSG1 and CDSN was observed when these molecules were incubated with hK5 and hK7 (8Caubet C. Jonca N. Brattsand M. Guerrin M. Bernard D. Schmidt R. Egelrud T. Simon M. Serre G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 1235-1244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Our unpublished observation 3M. Kishibe and S. Yoshida, unpublished observation. showed that recombinant mK8 did not cleave DSG1 efficiently, suggesting that mK6 and mK7 are more involved in DSG1 cleavage. In summary, we showed that Klk8 and mK8 are involved in proliferation of keratinocytes and desquamation possibly through other kallikreins. The assumed protease cascade may result in the cleavage of DSG1 and CDSN. The phenotype of Klk8-/- skin in this study may be the result of a failure to maintain the balance of proliferation and shedding. We thank Dr. S. Kato at Department of Biochemistry for assisting with enzymatic assays. The Klk8-/- mice were provided by Dr. Shiosaka at Nara Institute of Science and Technology. We also thank K. Nishikura, T.

Subsequently, a transpeptidation process transfers the activated amino acid in the initiating module, FenC1, in the initiating enzyme, FenC, to the activated amino acid at the thiolation domain in the next module, FenC2, ultimately forming a dipeptide, l-Glu-l-Orn, on FenC (5Lin T.P.

In the next step, the dipeptide synthesized on FenC is translocated to FenD; during this process, l-Orn is racemized to d-Orn (22Luo L. Kohli R.M. Onishi M. Linne U. Marahiel M.A. Walsh C.T.

This process continues from one module to another and from one peptide synthetase to another peptide synthetase until the elongating peptide chain reaches FenB (12Lin G.H. Chen C.L. Tschen J.S. Tsay S.S. Chang Y.S. Liu S.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1338-1341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a thioesterase domain that terminates peptide synthesis and releases the peptide chain from the enzyme (24Samel S.A.

During fengycin synthesis, the elongating fengycin peptide must be transferred from one peptide synthetase to another in a particular order; otherwise, a fengycin molecule with a particular sequence cannot be synthesized. Given the amino acid sequence in fengycin (Fig. 1A) and the amino acid activated by each fengycin synthetase, fengycin synthesis is predicted to begin from FenC and to proceed via FenD, FenE, and FenA finally to FenB. This investigation demonstrates that the five fengycin synthetases interact to form a chain, in which the amino acid-activating modules are lined up colinearly with the amino acids in the fengycin molecules. Formation of this peptide synthetase chain explains why fengycin is synthesized efficiently and accurately.

A DNA fragment amplified with primers FenB-dTeF (5′-CCCGGATCCTCTCATCACCATCACCACACTAAGCTTAATTA) and FenB-dTeR (5′-CCCGGATCCTGACAGCTGATTAGAATAAAGCTTTTCCGC), using pFC6A5 as a template, was inserted into the BamHI site in pQE60 (Qiagen) to form pFB230 to express histidine-tagged FenB without its thioesterase domain (FenB-dTE). PCR fragments amplified, using B. subtilis F29-3 chromosomal DNA as a template, with primers FenC-N-F (5′-GGGGTACCATCCTCTTATAAATTAGAATTGG) and FenC-N-B (5′-GGATCCCATGGCATCAACGGTTGCTTCTGTCGG); FenD-N-F (5′-GAGGATCCTGGAAAAGGTGTGTGGAATTGATGACG) and FenD-N-B (5′-CTTCTAGACTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCATTTGGATAATGGCGCTC), FenE-N-F (5′-GGGGATCCAACCGCGAATGGAGTGCCGCTG) and FenE-N-Bfg (5′-GCTCTAGACTTATCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCTCGAGGAATTCAACCAACCTGTCCG); FenA-N-F (5′-GGGGTACCTGGACAGTATATCCAGCTTGG) and FenA-fgN (5′-GTTAAAGCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCATGGTATATGCCGACACTACATGAG); and FenB-N-F (5′-GGGGTACCGAGGACGCGCTCCAAGAAATCG) and FenB-N-Bfg (5′-GAAGATCTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAATCCATGGACCCTGTCAGGATAAACCGG) were inserted at the BamHI site in pUC18 to form pFC210, pFD210, pFE210, pFA210, and pFB210, which expressed the N-terminal 700-amino acid region in FenC, 700-amino acid region in FenD, 900-amino acid region in FenE, 800-amino acid region in FenA, and 700-amino acid region in FenB, respectively, with a FLAG tag at the C terminus. PCR fragments amplified, using B. subtilis F29-3 chromosomal DNA as a template, with FenC-C-F (5′-CAGGATCCGGTACCAATGTAAAACTGTGCGTAC) and FenC-C-B (5′-CGGGATCCAGAAGATCTTTAACGAGATTTTC); FenD-C-F (5′-GAGGATCCGGTACCGAGCTGTATATTGGCGGAG) and FenD-C-B (5′-GCGGATCCAGTACTTTGTTGACGGCCCCCAT); FenE-C-F (5′-GAGGATCCCGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGCTAGATCTGGCACGCTGGCTACCGG) and FenE-C-B (5′-GGGTCTAGACTCGAGCAAGTCTTCCACCAAGCTGG); FenA-C-F (5′-GAAGATCTCGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGGTCGACAAGCTCGGCGTAACAAGG) and FenA-C-B (5′-GTTTAAGCTTACTCGAGAACCATGGCGTGAAAACTGAGCATATCAGCG); and FenB-C-F (5′-GAAGATCTCGATTACAAGGATGACGACGATAAGCTGGCCAGAACATTGTATGAAAACG) and FenB-C-B (5′-CTTACTCGAGTTAAACCATGGCATGCTTATTTGGCAGCACTTTTTGAT) were inserted at the BamHI site in pET30 (Novagen) to construct pFC220, pFD220, pFE220, pFA220, and pFB220, which expressed C-terminal 700-amino acid regions in FenC, FenD, and FenE, a 1200-amino acid region in FenA, and an 800-amino acid region in FenB, respectively, with a histidine tag at the C terminus. Transformation—E. coli was transformed using the CaCl2 transformation method of Cohen and Chang (29Cohen S.N. Chang A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). B. subtilis F29-3 was transformed according to the method of Imanaka et al. (30Imanaka T. Fujii M. Aramori I. Aiba S. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 824-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Fengycin Synthetases to Histidine-tagged FenC— E. coli HB101(pFC200) and B. subtilis F29-3 were cultured in 1 liter of LB broth and soybean-mannitol-nitrate medium, respectively, to the mid-log phase. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in 30 ml of a homogenization buffer that contained 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm imidazole. Cells were homogenized three times with an Amicon French Press (Thermo Spectronic, Rochester, NY) at 1200 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 31,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove debris. E. coli HB101(pFC200) and B. subtilis F29-3 lysates were mixed, and Ni2+-NTA 3The abbreviations used are: NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; COM, communication-mediating. -agarose beads (Qiagen) (1 ml) were added to the lysate mixture to demonstrate the binding of fengycin synthetases to histidine-tagged FenC (His-FenC). After the mixture had been mixed on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were poured into a 5-ml polypropylene column. The column was washed twice with 60 ml of a wash buffer that contained 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Proteins that bound to the beads were then eluted with 2 ml of elution buffer that contained 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. Eluted proteins were finally separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads were added to the lysate prepared from 1 liter of cells to isolate the fengycin synthetase complex from B. subtilis F29-3(pFC200). Proteins that bound to the beads were purified and analyzed by the same methods as described above. Lysates from 5 liters of cells were used in a study of strains that contained a mutated fengycin synthetase gene. Sucrose Gradient Sedimentation—A 10-ml linear 25–65% sucrose gradient was prepared in a Beckman SW41 centrifuge tube with a Gradient Station (BioComp, New Brunswick, Canada). Cell lysate (1 ml) was loaded on the top of the gradient and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 24 h at 4 °C with a Beckman SW41 rotor. The gradient was fractionated into 10 fractions with the gradient station, and proteins in the fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Fengycin synthetases were separated by SDS-PAGE with 6% gels and stained by a silver stain method (31Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3734) Google Scholar). Proteins in the gels were electroblotted onto an Immoblon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) following a method described elsewhere (32Chang L.K. Lee Y.H. Cheng T.S. Hong Y.R. Lu P.J.

Anti-FenC and anti-FenA antibodies were generated in rabbits; anti-FenB antibody was monoclonal. Polyclonal antibodies were purified with an Affi-Gel 10 column (Bio-Rad), using antigens purified from E. coli. Anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma. Immunoblotting was performed following a method reported elsewhere (32Chang L.K. Lee Y.H. Cheng T.S. Hong Y.R. Lu P.J. Wang J.J. Wang W.H. Kuo C.W. Li S.S. Liu S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38803-38812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Protein bands were finally detected using a SuperSignal kit (Pierce). MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Proteins in polyacrylamide gel were digested with trypsin according to a method described elsewhere (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7784) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were analyzed using a Brooker Biflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Billarica, MA). The m/z ratios of the digested peptides and their fragmented ions were used to search the annotated B. subtilis genome in the mass spectrometry protein sequence database (MSDB) through Mascot search software, version 1.8 (Matrix Science Inc., Boston, MA). A maximum of one missed trypsin cleavage, variable modification including carbamidomethylation, and 1 Da peptide mass tolerance were the search criteria used. The proteins were unambiguously identified as significant hits (p < 0.05) by Mascot peptide mass fingerprint search. Immunofluorescence Analysis—B. subtilis cells were immunostained following a method described elsewhere (34Harry E.J. Pogliano K. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3386-3393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications, including a fixation step that involved 30% acetone and 70% methanol rather than glutaldehyde. Additionally, cells underwent a second round of lysozyme treatment for 3 h after they were fixed. Furthermore, cells were treated with 4% Triton X-100 rather than Tween 20. Immunostaining was performed with polyclonal anti-FenC antibody and monoclonal anti-FenB antibody diluted by a factor of 200. The cells were then treated with 200-fold diluted Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody and 500-fold diluted Alexa 598-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were finally examined using a Leica model TCS SP2 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Electron Microscopy—Fengycin synthetase complexes purified using Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads from B. subtilis F29-3(pFC200) were adsorbed to a glow-discharged carbon copper grid (Agar Scientific, Essex, UK) and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate (Electron Microscopy Sciences). The enzyme complexes were imaged at room temperature using a JEOL JEM-1230 electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. Peptide Synthesis Assay—Ni2+-NTA beads were added to a mixture of the lysates prepared from 500 ml of E. coli HB101(pFB230) and 500 ml of B. subtilis F29-3 culture to reconstitute and purify a fengycin synthetase complex that contained a mutant FenB, FenB-dTE, which lacks the thioesterase domain. Proteins that were bound to the beads were purified according to the method described above and dialyzed against a buffer that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm Na4P2O7, and 20% sucrose. Reconstituted fengycin synthetase complexes with FenB-dTE (2.6 μg) were added to a reaction mixture that contained 2 mm MgCl2; 2 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol; 2 mm ATP; 2 mm EDTA; 20 mm Mes-Hepes, pH 7.5; 100 μm coenzyme A; 2 mm each of l-alanine, l-glutamic acid, l-isoleucine, l-ornithine, l-threonine, l-tyrosine, and l-valine; 1 μCi each of l-[C14]ornithine (57 mCi/mmol), l-[C14]tyrosine (473 mCi/mmol), and l-[C14]proline (252 mCi/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction mixture (200 μl) was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Following the reaction, 1 ml of a denaturation buffer, which contained 100 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 8 m urea was added to terminate the reaction and to dissociate fengycin synthetases. Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (50 μl) were then added. After they had been washed three times with 1 ml of a wash buffer that contained 100 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.3, 8 m urea, Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads were collected on a GF/C glass fiber filter (Whatman, Maidston, UK), which was then dried. Then the radioactivity was counted in 15 ml of Fluroansafe 2 (BDH, Poole, UK) using a liquid scintillation counter (LS5000TD; Beckman). Interactions among Fengycin Synthetases in Vitro—Peptide synthetases are known to comprise conserved sequences and domains. Therefore, antibodies generated with fengycin synthetases often lack specificity. Even monoclonal anti-FenE antibodies produced in this laboratory nonspecifically detected all of the fengycin synthetases in immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Among the antibodies used in this study, only a monoclonal anti-FenB antibody, which recognizes an epitope in the thioesterase domain, specifically recognized FenB. The lack of antibody specificity, while not a problem in the analysis of FenA and FenB by immunoblotting, caused particular difficulty in determining the interactions among FenC, FenD, and FenE by immunoblotting, since these three enzymes had similar molecular masses of about 290 kDa. Therefore, this work adopted both immunoblotting and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to analyze the interactions among fengycin synthetases. This study first investigated whether FenA in the B. subtilis F29-3 lysate interacted with recombinant His-FenC in vitro. Adding Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads into the lysate from E. coli HB101(pFC200), as expected, caused His-FenC to bind to the beads (Fig. 2A, lane 5). However, none of the fengycin synthetases in the B. subtilis F29-3 lysate was bound to the beads, because the enzymes lack a histidine tag (Fig. 2, A, lane 3, and B, lane 3). However, the binding of FenA to the beads became evident after the E. coli HB101(pFC200) and B. subtilis F29-3 lysates were mixed with each other (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 7). On the other hand, FenA is unstable, explaining why the FenA band that was detected by immunoblotting was faint (Fig. 2A, lane 6) unless a large amount of sample was loaded to a lane (Fig. 2A, lane 7). Therefore, this 406-kDa band was also studied using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The 406-kDa band in a lane loaded with the proteins eluted from Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads added to the E. coli HB101(pFC200)-B. subtilis F29-3 lysate mixture was excised from a gel that had been stained by silver stain. Analyzing this band by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, after the proteins in the gel slice were digested with trypsin, revealed a peptide fingerprint matching that of FenA (Table 1). Meanwhile, in parallel experiments, the 406-kDa band was undetected after silver staining in the lanes loaded with the proteins that had been eluted from the beads that were added to the E. coli HB101(pFC200) lysate or the E. coli HB101(pFC240)-B. subtilis F29-3 lysate mixture. Analysis of the proteins in gel pieces excised from the 406-kDa positions by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry did not yield a peptide fingerprint that matched that of FenA (Table 1). These results verified the immunoblot result that Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads retained FenA in the B. subtilis F29-3 lysate when His-FenC was present. Meanwhile, similar experiments were conducted to detect the interaction between His-FenC and FenB. FenB in the B. subtilis F29-3 lysate (Fig. 2B, lane 1) did not bind to Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Fig. 2B, lane 3) unless the lysate was mixed with the E. coli HB101(pFC200) lysate (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Besides, mixing the lysates from B. subtilis F29-3 and E. coli HB101(pFC240) did not result in a binding of FenB to the beads (Fig. 2B, lane 4). MALDI-TOF spectrometry analysis also confirmed that the 146 kDa band contained FenB (Table 1). After demonstrating the interactions among FenA, FenB, and His-FenC in vitro, this study further investigated whether FenD and FenE interacted with His-FenC. Analyzing the 290 kDa band in a lane loaded with the proteins eluted from Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads added to the E. coli HB101(pFC200) lysate by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as expected, revealed a peptide fingerprint that matched that of FenC (Table 1; supplemental Table 1). Meanwhile, a similar experiment was performed by adding the beads to an E. coli HB101(pFC200)-B. subtilis F29-3 lysate mixture. Analysis of the 290-kDa band in this case revealed peptide fingerprints that matched those of FenC, FenD, and FenE (Table 1; supplemental Table 2), indicating that His-FenC, FenD, and FenE were bound to the beads. Additionally, the peptides with m/z at 1215.60, 1260.66, and 1383.67 (supplemental Table 2) were further selected for MALDI-TOF-TOF analysis. The analysis revealed sequences of AVLPDFMVPAR, IHDEVPFTTFR, and DSGAALLLTQPGK, which matched the amino acid sequence in the regions from 1962 to 1972 in FenD, from 1119 to 1128 in FenC, and from 559 to 572 in FenE, respectively, confirming that the peptide mass fingerprint data obtained by MALDI-TOF analysis indeed detected FenC, FenD, and FenE. Meanwhile, a parallel experiment was conducted using a B. subtilis F29-3-E. coli HB101(pFC240) lysate mixture; not only did immunoblotting not detect the binding of the 290-kDa proteins to the Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Fig. 2A, lane 4), but also MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of a piece of gel excised from the 290-kDa region failed to detect any peptide fingerprint matching those of FenC, FenD, and FenE (Table 1; supplemental Table 2).TABLE 1MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of 146-, 290-, and 406-kDa proteins that were bound to His-FenCLysatesFenC (290 kDa)FenD (290 kDa)FenE (290 kDa)FenA (406 kDa)FenB (146 kDa)HB101(pFC200)Queries matchedaPeptides were searched for matched proteins in the MSDB data base220000Mowse scorebMowse scores greater than 50 indicate that the identification of proteins was significant (p < 0.05)760000F29-3 + HB101(pFC200)Queries matched1213272214Mowse score9662110126132F29-3 + HB101(pFC240)Queries matched00000Mowse score00000F29-3(pFC200)Queries matched2530331523Mowse score20921415159150F29-3(pFC240)Queries matched00000Mowse score00000FX12Queries matched00000Mowse score00000FX12(pFC200)Queries matched3319321231Mowse score1541146862100FX10(pFC200)Queries matched330000Mowse score880000FX14(pFC200)Queries matched1212000Mowse score72115000FE6(pFC200)Queries matched21141500Mowse score97519400FE5(pFC200)Queries matched11121590Mowse score9096111620a Peptides were searched for matched proteins in the MSDB data baseb Mowse scores greater than 50 indicate that the identification of proteins was significant (p < 0.05) Open table in a new tab Analyzing the Interactions among Fengycin Synthetases in Vivo—After demonstrating that fengycin synthetases interacted with His-FenC in vitro, this work added Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads to the B. subtilis F29-3(pFC200) lysate to investigate whether fengycin synthetases in the cell were retained by the beads. After the proteins were eluted from the beads and the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, bands of 406, 290, and 146 kDa were observed by staining with a silver stain. MALDI-TOF spectrometry confirmed that the 406-kDa band contained FenA (Table 1; supplemental Table 3); the 290 kDa band contained FenC, FenD, and FenE (Table 1; supplemental Table 3), and the 146 kDa band contained FenB (Table 1; supplemental Table 3). Meanwhile, a parallel experiment, which used a lysate from B. subtilis F29-3(pFC240), revealed that not only did staining and immunoblotting fail to detect the three fengycin synthetase bands, but also MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the gel pieces sliced from the 406-, 290-, and 146-kDa regions failed to detect peptides with a molecular mass that matched that of peptides from fengycin synthetases digested with trypsin (Table 1). Analyzing the Interactions of Fengycin Synthetases in Fengycin Synthetase Mutants—B. subtilis F29-3 mutants that contained a transposon insertion in fenC, fenD, fenE, fenA, and fenB, called FX12, FX10, FX14, FE6, and FE5, respectively (Fig. 1B), were transformed with pFC200 to elucidate how mutations in a fengycin synthetase gene affected the interactions among fengycin synthetases. In the case of the FX12 mutant, which contained a defective fenC, none of the fengycin synthetases in the lysate mutant bound to Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Table 1). However, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of the 406-, 290-, and 146-kDa bands in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained by silver staining revealed binding of all five fengycin synthetases to the beads when the mutant was transformed with pFC200 (Table 1). Meanwhile, using the FX10(pFC200) lysate yielded a different outcome; only His-FenC, and not the other fengycin synthetases, bound to the beads (Table 1). Additionally, both His-FenC and FenD in the FX14(pFC200) lysate; His-FenC, FenD, and FenE in the FE6(pFC200) lysate; and His-FenC, FenD, FenE, and FenA in the FE5(pFC200) lysate bound to the Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Table 1). Specific Interactions among Fengycin Synthetases in Vitro— To investigate how fengycin synthetases interact, the N-terminal and C-terminal regions in fengycin synthetases that were fused with a FLAG tag and a histidine tag, respectively, were expressed in E. coli. After the lysates were mixed, Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads were added. Proteins eluted from the beads were then separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody indicated the binding of a prot"
https://openalex.org/W1994369328,"Human CD38 is a multifunctional ectoenzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversions from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and from cADPR to ADP-ribose (ADPR). Both cADPR and ADPR are calcium messengers that can mobilize intracellular stores and activate influx as well. In this study, we determined three crystal structures of the human CD38 enzymatic domain complexed with cADPR at 1.5-Aå resolution, with its analog, cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR) (1.68Aå) and with NGD (2.1Aå), a substrate analog of NAD. The results indicate that the binding of cADPR or cGDPR to the active site induces structural rearrangements in the dipeptide Glu146-Asp147 by as much as 2.7Aå, providing the first direct evidence of a conformational change at the active site during catalysis. In addition, Glu226 is shown to be critical not only in catalysis but also in positioning of cADPR at the catalytic site through strong hydrogen bonding interactions. Structural details obtained from these complexes provide a step-by-step description of the catalytic processes in the synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR.

Calcium is a universal intracellular signal in regulating cellular functions (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). The ability of cells to use this single metal ion for distinct functions depends on modulating the generation, localization, and termination of spatial, temporal, and amplitudal characteristics of calcium waves by cell type-dependent toolkits (2Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium signals are regulated through the three structurally divergent messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) (3Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev.

It is intriguing that ADPR itself, the breakdown product of cADPR, has been shown to be able to gate the influx of calcium as well and with cADPR synergizing such an action (10Perraud A.L. Fleig A.

That the same enzyme is involved in the synthesis and hydrolysis of distinct calcium messengers indicates its central role in maintaining the homeostasis of these signals. To understand the multifunctionality of this novel signaling enzyme, it is imperative to obtain structural details at the atomic level. CD38 cyclizes NAD, a long linear molecule, to a compact cyclic nucleotide, cADPR. The active site of human CD38 has been biochemically and structurally characterized (12Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R.

Structure. 2005; 13: 1331-1339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Glu226 is identified as the catalytic residue, because its mutation to other residues essentially eliminates all its catalytic activities (12Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21566-21571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Ser193 is also important for catalysis as its mutation to alanine also greatly reduces enzyme activities (14Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32861-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Conversion of NAD to cADPR, however, is not the dominant reaction catalyzed by wild-type human CD38. In fact, the large majority of the substrate NAD is hydrolyzed to ADPR (6Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M.E. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Completely the opposite is observed when NGD, an analog of NAD, is used as substrate. The dominant reaction is now cyclization instead of hydrolysis, producing cyclic GDP-ribose (cGDPR) as the major product (15Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the similarity of NGD and NAD, which differ only in the purine rings, it is puzzling why the reactions are so different. Scheme 1 shows two different cyclization reactions catalyzed by human CD38 with NAD and NGD as substrates. It is interesting that, by mutating a conserved active site residue Glu146 to alanine, the mutant acquires greatly increased ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity. With NAD as substrate, the CD38 E146A mutant can produce three times more cADPR than ADPR, indicative of Glu146 role in controlling the cyclization and hydrolysis reactions. In this study, we employed x-ray crystallography to determine the structures of the enzymatic domain of human CD38 complexed with three relevant ligands, cADPR, cGDPR, and NGD. These complexes, together with previously solved NAD and ADPR complexes (14Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32861-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), allow us to provide a step-by-step description of the catalytic processes involved in the synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR. The results also provide the first evidence of a conformational change at the active site of CD38 during catalysis. Protein Expression, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Crystallization—E226Q, E226G, and E226D mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in a yeast expression system. The Pichia pastoris vector pPICzαA (purchased from Invitrogen) was used for generating all the mutants. The soluble domain of hCD38, starting with arginine 45, was cloned into the vector between the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites in the multiple cloning site of the vector. This subcloning method allows for the ligation of the soluble CD38 in-frame with the α-factor secretion signal. Expression is driven by the tightly controlled alcohol oxidase promoter AOX1, which is induced by methanol. The protein is initially expressed as a fusion of the secretion signal peptide, which is cleaved off by endogenous proteolytic enzymes, and the CD38 secreted into the expression medium. Mutations were performed using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit obtained from Stratagene. Complementary primers containing the mutations were used to amplify the entire plasmid using the high fidelity PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The amplification is linear, and only 20 cycles were used to minimize the chances of generating errors during the process. At the end of the amplification process the reaction mixture contained the newly synthesized vector with nicks at the priming site, and the parent (template) vector, which is hemimethylated due to being amplified in an Escherichia coli strain. Using the endonuclease DpnI, the methylated vector is digested away leaving behind the newly synthesized vector containing the mutation of interest, which was used to transform super-competent XL1-Blue E. coli cells purchased from Stratagene. The positive clones were checked for the presence of the insert, sequenced, and used for the transformation of the X-33 yeast cells. Primers for the mutations are listed below.

The positive clones containing the mutation were linearized by digesting the vector with SacI and using the linearized vector to transform electrocompetent X-33 yeast cells. The transformed cells were selected under 100 μg/ml zeocin. Colonies were formed between 3 and 4 days post-transfection, and six clones from each transfection were selected for expression screening by activity assays and SDS-PAGE. Previously established purification strategies were followed to get pure proteins (12Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21566-21571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Munshi C. Fryxell K.B. Lee H.C. Branton W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Before crystallization, the samples were concentrated to 8 mg/ml and stored at -80 °C. The E226Q mutant was crystallized based on a previously reported recipe (14Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32861-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). E226G and E226D crystals were formed by hanging drop vapor-diffusion technique. For E226G crystals, a 1-μl sample was mixed with a 1-μl reservoir that contains 100 mm MES, 13% PEG 4000, pH 6.0. For E226D crystals, the optimized crystallization condition was determined by increasing the concentration of PEG 4000 from 13 to 15%, while other conditions were the same as that for E226G crystals. At room temperature, crystals usable for data collection appeared within 1 week. Preparation of cADPR, cGDPR, and NGD Complexes—NGD and cADPR were purchased from Sigma. cGDPR was synthesized by incubating NGD with Aplysia cyclase followed by HPLC column purification as described before (15Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of complexes by co-crystallization was not possible, as the residual hydrolysis activities of the mutants were sufficient to break down the ligands during the process. Instead, all complexes were obtained by soaking preformed crystals with solutions containing cADPR, cGDPR, or NGD. The soaking process was performed at 4 °C to prevent damage to the crystals, which could happen in minutes at room temperature. Specifically, the cADPR complexes were obtained by incubating E226Q, E226G, or E226D crystals with 48 mm cADPR solution buffered with the crystallization mother liquor for 3-8 min at 4 °C; the cGDPR complex was obtained by incubating E226Q crystals with 40 mm cGDPR for 5 min; and the NGD complex was obtained by incubating E226Q crystals with 20 mm NGD for 2 min. These soaked crystals were then quickly transferred and preserved in liquid nitrogen until data acquisition. Data Collection, Reduction, and Structure Refinements—Crystallographic data were collected at the Cornell High-Energy Synchrotron Source A1 station with a fixed wavelength of 0.976 Aå. Under the cryo-stream protection at 100 K, each crystal was rotated 360 degrees with 1° oscillation. Data sets were integrated and scaled by using the program package HKL2000 (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The apo structure of shCD38 (PDB id 1YH3) was used as the initial model for structure solution by the molecular replacement method implemented in MOLREP (18Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The initial model of cADPR was derived from its crystal structure (19Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Levitt D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The NGD and cGDPR models were manually built in O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. kjeldgaard M.

Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4360) Google Scholar). Subsequent crystallographic refinements and solvent addition were done with the program REFMAC (18Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Overview of Complex Structures—The structures of the soluble extramembrane domain of human CD38 (shCD38) complexed with various nucleotides were obtained by soaking substrates cADPR, cGDPR, or NGD with crystals of E226 mutants (E226Q, E226D, or E226G). All these mutants show greatly reduced catalytic abilities compared with that of the wild-type shCD38 (12Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21566-21571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the residual activities prevented us from obtaining these complexes by co-crystallization, wherein only products were observed. Among these mutants, E226Q is the least active one. By incubating preformed E226Q crystals with cADPR, cGDPR, or NGD for minutes in a cold room, stable complexes were obtained. The low temperature reduces the catalytic activity and slows down the diffusion of substrates into the active site, alleviating damage to the crystals. Like wild-type shCD38, the shCD38 mutants were crystallized in space group P1 with two shCD38 molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit in a head-to-tail fashion (14Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32861-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The structures of the complexes were determined by molecular replacement with the wild-type structure as the search model. In all three complex structures, cADPR, cGDPR, and NGD were bound tightly in the catalytic sites defined by the residues Trp125, Trp189, Glu146, Asp155, and Glu226 as proposed previously (12Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21566-21571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Graeff R. Munshi C. Aarhus R. Johns M. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12169-12173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). No secondary binding sites were seen for any of the substrates/products (cADPR, cGDPR, and NGD) either within the protein or between the interfaces of the two shCD38 molecules in the unit cell. This is consistent with our previous findings that NAD and ADPR bind to the same site of the enzyme (14Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32861-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, the multiple catalytic reactions of shCD38 occur within the same active site. The cyclic molecules, cADPR and cGDPR, possess common ribose and phosphate groups, but with different purine rings. The sites of cyclization are also different. In cADPR, the adenine ring is cyclized with the terminal ribose at its N-1 of the adenine, while in cGDPR, it is at the N-7 of the guanine. It is the same N-1/N-7-glycosidic bond that is cleaved, respectively, during the CD38-catalyzed hydrolysis. Consistently, as seen in the complexes (Fig. 1, A and B), the bound cADPR and cGDPR are oriented with the portions containing the N-1/N-7-glycosyl bonds embedded deep toward the bottom of the active site pocket where catalysis occurs. Fig. 1C shows shCD38 complexes with NGD, the substrate for the synthesis of cGDPR. It can be seen that the part of NGD, a long linear molecule, containing the nicotinamide group penetrates deep into the active site pocket. This is again consistent with catalysis occurring at the bottom of the pocket and indicates that the nicotinamide group of NGD is the first to be removed during catalysis, before cyclization. cADPR Complexes Reveal the Role of Glu226 in Substrate cADPR Activation—Human CD38 is the only human enzyme known to hydrolyze cADPR to ADPR. The refined E226Q-cADPR complex structure at 1.98-Aå resolution is the first reported structure of cADPR complexed with a protein (Fig. 1A and Fig. 2). The high resolution diffraction data allowed unambiguous identification of the position and orientation of cADPR in the active site from the Fo-Fc omit map (Fig. 2). The cADPR binding site in the E226Q mutant is formed by residues Arg127, Thr221, Glu146, Asp155, and Trp189. All these residues have direct polar or no-polar interactions with cADPR (Fig. 2). The adenine ring of cADPR adopts an orientation such that it has both hydrophobic interactions with the side chain of Trp189 and hydrophilic interactions with Glu146 and Asp155. Although the N-1-glycosidic bond of the bound cADPR is facing and is close to the bottom of the active site pocket, it is striking that it is 7.9 Aå away from the catalytic residue Gln226 (Glu226 in wild-type), too far to be attacked by it. That Glu226 is the catalytic residue has previously been established by both structural and mutagenesis studies (12Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21566-21571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32861-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The gap between cADPR and the catalytic residue is filled with five water molecules, which form a stable hydrogen bonds network to prevent the further entry of cADPR (Fig. 2). It is thus clear that this form represents an inactive complex between shCD38 and cADPR and is consistent with E226Q being catalytically impaired. In fact, this inactive form of complex is characteristic of all inactive mutants we have examined. The superposition of the cADPR complex structures obtained from three inactive mutants of shCD38, E226Q, E226G, and E226D reveals essentially the same cADPR structure. It appears, for these Glu226 mutants, that cADPR cannot be correctly positioned in their active sites in close enough distance to Glu226 for catalysis. Repeating the soaking experiments at room temperature gave similar results, indicating this form of cADPR binding is temperature-independent. With wild-type shCD38 crystals, however, even short soaking below 0 °C resulted in its hydrolysis to ADPR. The ability of wild-type shCD38 to hydrolyze cADPR demonstrates that Glu226 is not only catalytic but, surprisingly, is also essential for the binding of cADPR to an active position. It should be noted that all inactive mutants have some residual catalytic activities (12Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21566-21571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), indicating that cADPR can transit from the inactive position in the complex to an active one, albeit at a very low rate. Once in the active position, it can then be readily hydrolyzed. This has been verified structurally, as the ADPR product is found in the active site during long term co-crystallization of E226Q with cADPR (14Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32861-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The complexes of cADPR with the CD38 mutants thus reveal an unexpectedly active role of Glu226 in promoting the binding of cADPR to an active position in the catalytic pocket. Binding of cGDPR and cADPR Requires Structural Movement of Dipeptide Glu146-Asp147—What this active position for the hydrolysis of cADPR is, in fact, can be inferred from the cGDPR complex obtained by incubating cGDPR with E226Q crystals at 4 °C, as shown in Fig. 3A. The structure was refined at 1.68-Aå resolution, and the electron density map clearly defines positions for all the cGDPR atoms (Fig. 3A). In contrast to cADPR, cGDPR enters deeply into the active site with its N-7-glycosyl bond positioned only 3.96 Aå from Gln226. Its guanine ring group is recognized and positioned by residues Glu146, Asp155, and Trp189 through hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. Water molecules, Wat1 and Wat2, form two additional hydrogen bonds to cGDPR O6 and 2′-OH, respectively. The nicotinamide ribose has direct polar interactions with the Gln226 carbonyl group and the main chain nitrogen of Trp125. Two phosphate groups on cGDPR form extensive polar interactions with dipeptide Ser126-Arp127 and the main chain nitrogen of Phe222. Even the guanine ribose, which is located at the entrance of the active site, is stabilized by a hydrogen bond with Thr221 (Fig. 3A). There are two shCD38 E226Q molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. We observed that cGDPR can only bind to the active site of molecule A. In the active site of molecule B, the electron density can only be modeled as solvent. The inability of molecule B to bind with cGDPR suggests its reduced affinity for cGDPR. It is thus interesting to see the structural differences between the active sites of the two E226Q molecules in the same crystallographic asymmetric unit (molecule A and B). This can be done by structurally aligning the two molecules. The alignment reveals that Glu146 in the apo structure (dark-green) is required to move away from the active site to make sufficient space for the binding of the guanine ring of cGDPR (Fig. 3B). This backward movement of Glu146 (from its dark-green position to gray position) can be as far as 2.66 Aå, a distance corresponding to the length of a hydrogen bond (Fig. 3B). As a consequence of the backward shift of Glu146, its neighboring residue Asp147 retreats accordingly (from its dark-green position to gray position). Hence the comparison of the apo and the cGDPR-bound complex indicates the overall effect induced by cGDPR binding is the backward movement of the dipeptide Glu146-Asp147. This movement can be illustrated more dramatically by adding the cADPR complex to the alignment as shown in Fig. 3C. Residues Glu146 and Asp147 in the cADPR complex (magenta) adopt a position between the apo position and cGDPR-bound position. It can be concluded that the entry of either cADPR or cGDPR to the active site requires the consistent movements of Glu146 and Asp147, more extensive with cGDPR than with cADPR. Comparing the cADPR and the cGDPR complexes, it can be seen that cGDPR bound much tighter then cADPR, with the ribosyl C1′ atoms of cGDPR ∼3.7 Aå deeper into the active site. The tight association is due mainly to the fact that cGDPR is larger than cADPR, such that the guanine ring forms stable interactions with Trp189, Asp155, and Glu146 through both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions (Fig. 3A). Particularly is the extensive overlap between the tryptophan ring and the guanine ring with face-to-face π-π interactions between their five-membered rings. This tight binding likewise induces the much larger movement of the dipeptide Glu146-Asp147 than cADPR. NGD Complex Together with cGDPR/NAD Complexes Defines a Site Responsible for Substrate Specificity—When NGD is used as substrate, human CD38 mainly cyclizes it to cGDPR (15Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to when NAD is used as substrate, which is predominately hydrolyzed to ADPR. To find the structural basis for this disparity, we determined E226Q mutant complexed with its substrate NGD at 2.1-Aå resolution. Fig. 4A shows that the nicotinamide group of the bound NGD points toward Glu146 and Asp155 and forms two hydrogen bonds with them (Fig. 4A). The nicotinamide ribose and the diphosphate of NGD interact with protein residues in the same way as their corresponding parts in cGDPR (Figs. 3A and 4A). The Fo-Fc omit electron densities are clear for the nicotinamide terminus and the diphosphate, but not good for its guanine terminus (Fig. 4A). The disordered density reflects the flexibility of the guanine ring of the bound NGD, analogous to the poor density observed for the adenine terminus of bound NAD (14Liu Q. Kriksunov I.A. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Hao Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32861-32869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Structural alignment of the NGD and NAD complexes indicates that NGD and NAD share a common interaction pattern with the enzyme (Fig. 4B). NGD overlaps quite well with NAD except for its guanine terminus. The similarity indicates the structural determinants responsible for the differences in the reactions between NGD and NAD are not in the nicotinamide end, but the purine rings instead. As described above, the guanine ring can form much tighter association with the active site (i.e. Trp189, Asp155, and Glu146) than adenine. Once folded back, the hig"
https://openalex.org/W2157286376,"The theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) predicts that beta decay of the neutron into a proton, electron and antineutrino should be accompanied by a continuous spectrum of soft photons. While this inner bremsstrahlung branch has been previously measured in nuclear beta and electron capture decay, it has never been observed in free neutron decay. Recently, the photon energy spectrum and branching ratio for neutron radiative decay have been calculated using two approaches: a standard QED framework and heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (an effective theory of hadrons based on the symmetries of quantum chromodynamics). The QED calculation treats the nucleons as point-like, whereas the latter approach includes the effect of nucleon structure in a systematic way. Here we observe the radiative decay mode of free neutrons, measuring photons in coincidence with both the emitted electron and proton. We determined a branching ratio of (3.13 +/- 0.34) x 10(-3) (68 per cent level of confidence) in the energy region between 15 and 340 keV, where the uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects. The value is consistent with the predictions of both theoretical approaches; the characteristic energy spectrum of the radiated photons, which differs from the uncorrelated background spectrum, is also consistent with the calculated spectrum. This result may provide opportunities for more detailed investigations of the weak interaction processes involved in neutron beta decay."
https://openalex.org/W1990769457,"The spindle assembly checkpoint arrests cells in mitosis when defects in mitotic spindle assembly or partitioning of the replicated genome are detected. This checkpoint blocks exit from mitosis until the defect is rectified or the cell initiates apoptosis. In this study we have used caffeine to identify components of the mechanism that signals apoptosis in mitotic checkpoint-arrested cells. Addition of caffeine to spindle checkpoint-arrested cells induced >40% apoptosis within 5 h. It also caused proteasome-mediated destruction of cyclin B1, a corresponding reduction in cyclin B1/cdk1 activity, and reduction in MPM-2 reactivity. However, cells retained MAD2 staining at the kinetochores, an indication of continued spindle checkpoint function. Blocking proteasome activity did not block apoptosis, but continued spindle checkpoint function was essential for apoptosis. After systematically eliminating all known targets, we have identified p21-activated kinase PAK1, which has an anti-apoptotic function in spindle checkpoint-arrested cells, as a target for caffeine inhibition. Knockdown of PAK1 also increased apoptosis in spindle checkpoint-arrested cells. This study demonstrates that the spindle checkpoint not only regulates mitotic exit but apoptosis in mitosis through the activity of PAK1. The spindle assembly checkpoint arrests cells in mitosis when defects in mitotic spindle assembly or partitioning of the replicated genome are detected. This checkpoint blocks exit from mitosis until the defect is rectified or the cell initiates apoptosis. In this study we have used caffeine to identify components of the mechanism that signals apoptosis in mitotic checkpoint-arrested cells. Addition of caffeine to spindle checkpoint-arrested cells induced >40% apoptosis within 5 h. It also caused proteasome-mediated destruction of cyclin B1, a corresponding reduction in cyclin B1/cdk1 activity, and reduction in MPM-2 reactivity. However, cells retained MAD2 staining at the kinetochores, an indication of continued spindle checkpoint function. Blocking proteasome activity did not block apoptosis, but continued spindle checkpoint function was essential for apoptosis. After systematically eliminating all known targets, we have identified p21-activated kinase PAK1, which has an anti-apoptotic function in spindle checkpoint-arrested cells, as a target for caffeine inhibition. Knockdown of PAK1 also increased apoptosis in spindle checkpoint-arrested cells. This study demonstrates that the spindle checkpoint not only regulates mitotic exit but apoptosis in mitosis through the activity of PAK1. Cell cycle checkpoints are activated in response to various forms of cellular stress to block cell cycle progression until the stress, e.g. DNA damage, chromatin abnormalities, is correctly resolved.

Agents such as ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors that have clinical utility in treatment of a wide spectrum of cancers trigger this checkpoint response in cancer cell lines that are defective for p53, where the checkpoint provides a degree of protection from the cytotoxic actions of these treatments. Inhibitors of either ATM/ATR, the most commonly used being caffeine, or inhibitors of chk1/2, such as UCN01 or more recently Gö6976, which abrogate this checkpoint response, can potentiate the cytotoxicity of the therapeutics in cell culture (2Anderson H.J.

Abrogation of this checkpoint results in cells undergoing “mitotic catastrophe.” This term combines the concept of aberrant mitosis and cell death. Cells entering mitosis after bypassing the G2 checkpoint undergo aberrant mitosis with increased cell death, implying that the two are connected (5Castedo M. Perfettini J.L. Roumier T. Andreau K. Medema R. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2825-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar).The spindle assembly checkpoint ensures the fidelity of partitioning of the replicated genome by blocking exit from mitosis until bipolar attachment of all chromosomes to the spindle poles and equal tension are achieved. The kinetochores then signal that anaphase can commence. This checkpoint operates by blocking anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)-dependent degradation of key regulators, cyclin B1 and securin, thereby maintaining mitosis and blocking sister chromatid separation (6Wassmann K. Benezra R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Checkpoint signaling involves a kinetochore-associated protein complex, which includes MAD1, MAD2, Bub3, and BubR1. These proteins associate with unattached kinetochores and regulate the formation of MAD2-CDC20 complexes, which prevents CDC20-mediated ubiquitination of cyclin B1 and its destruction by APC/C (7Yu H.

Tumor cell lines treated with anti-microtubule drugs, such as nocodazole or taxol that trigger the spindle assembly checkpoint, arrest in mitosis for an extended period, but eventually cells will adapt and overcome the checkpoint, exiting mitosis without partitioning their genome (13Weaver B.A. Cleveland D.W.

Cells should remain arrested in mitosis or undergo adaptation, exiting mitosis to produce aneuploid cells that are replicatively senescent and eventually die. Abrogating the G2 checkpoint using drugs that inhibit either ATM/ATR or the downstream checkpoint kinases chk1/2 triggers a higher level of cell death (19Eastman A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The question of what triggers this mitotic cell death is of interest, as identifying this mechanism may define new targets to increase the cytotoxicity of G2 checkpoint inhibitors and anti-microtubule drugs. The question of whether cells must inappropriately exit from the aberrant mitosis to die or trigger apoptosis while still in mitosis is also unresolved.Caffeine is a methylxanthine that has a diverse range of pharmacological effects. It is an inhibitor of multiple enzymes, ATM/ATR involved in checkpoint signaling (20Blasina A. Price B.D. Turenne G.A. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1135-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 21Hall-Jackson C.A. Cross D.A. Morrice N. Smythe C.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), increasing levels of cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation. Caffeine is commonly used to abrogate the DNA damage G2 checkpoint by inhibiting ATM/ATR. In this study we demonstrate that caffeine triggers apoptosis in mitotic checkpoint-arrested cells and have used caffeine to identify components of the mechanism that trigger this apoptosis. We show that caffeine initiates proteasome-mediated cyclin B1 destruction and reduction in cyclin B1/CDK1 activity and MPM-2 reactivity. Caffeine also promoted a rapid apoptotic response, in which up to 50% of cells underwent apoptosis within 5 h of caffeine addition. The inappropriate proteasome-mediated cyclin B1 destruction was not required for apoptosis, but continued checkpoint activity was essential. We demonstrate that caffeine directly inhibits PAK1 activity, which has been reported to have anti-apoptotic activity. Thus by defining the mechanism by which caffeine promotes apoptosis in mitotic arrested cells, we have demonstrated that the spindle checkpoint regulates not only exit from mitosis but also apoptosis in mitotic cells, possibly by controlling the activity of PAK1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Nocodazole, taxol (paclitaxol), caffeine, etoposide, roscovitine, the proteasome inhibitor MG132, forskolin, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP were purchased from Sigma.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine donor serum (Serum Supreme, Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ). HeLa cells stably overexpressing Bcl-2 where as described previously (27Warrener R. Beamish H. Burgess A. Waterhouse N.J. Giles N. Fairlie D. Gabrielli B. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated overnight with nocodazole (0.25 μg/ml) or taxol (100 nm), and mitotic cells were isolated by mechanical shake-off, replated, inhibitors added, and cells harvested at later time points. Nocodazole concentration ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 μg/ml gave identical data. Caffeine was used at a final concentration of 5 mm, wortmannin at 5 μm, LY294002, U0126, MG132 at 10 μm, Z-VAD-fmk, Gö6976 at 100 nm, roscovitine at 50 μm, ZM447439 at 5 μm, ATM inhibitor Ku 005933 at 20 μm, AKT inhibitor SH-5 at 10 μm, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP at 10 μm. In some experiments nocodazole was washed off with three washes of fresh, prewarmed 10% serum-containing media and then cells were replated, inhibitors added, and cells harvested at later time points. Double thymidine block release synchrony of HeLa cells was performed as described previously (25Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either GFP or GFP-Bax (kindly provided by Dr. R. Patel, University of Leicester, UK (28Deacon K. Mistry P. Chernoff J. Blank J.L. Patel R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2071-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar)) and then cultured for 48 h. Cells were arrested in mitosis overnight with nocodazole, loaded with 200 nm TMRE, and then treated with caffeine. Cells were followed by time-lapse microscopy capturing images of TMRE and GFP fluorescence and transmitted light for cell morphology.siRNA knockdown of PAK1 was achieved using synthetic RNA oligonucleotides 5′-CAUCAAAUAUCACUAAGUCdTdT-3′ and 5′-CAGACCGUGUGUAUACAGAdTdT-3′ or a scrambled control oligonucleotide. 40 nm siRNA was transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions, with cultures harvested at 24 and 48 h after transfection for immunoblotting or followed by time-lapse microscopy. ATR shRNA was a kind gift from Y. Shiloh, Tel Aviv University, Israel. HeLa cells were transfected and then after 24 h were selected with 5 μg/ml puromycin for 48 h. Cells were then treated overnight with nocodazole followed by addition of caffeine or the ATM inhibitor Ku-0055933 at 20 μm. This concentration was sufficient to block ATM-dependent activity (data not shown).For time-lapse microscopy experiments, cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated multiwell plates; nocodazole or taxol was added for 16 h, and then either inhibitors were added or nocodazole was washed off and inhibitors added. Time-lapse movies were produced using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M Cell Observer with 37 °C incubator hood and 5% CO2 cover. Digital images were taken every 10–15 min with a Zeiss AxioCam and the images processed using AxioVision 4.2 software. Cumulative mitotic and apoptotic cell counts were performed by following cells in three or four random fields over several hours. The time at which cells either entered mitosis or underwent apoptosis was recorded for each cell in the field. The fields were combined and reported as a percentage of the total number of cells in the field at the start of the experiments. The data presented are typical of two to four separate experiments. In some experiments, GFP-H2B-expressing HeLa cells were used to visualize the chromatin in live cells.FACS analysis of DNA content was performed as described previously (25Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and MPM-2 FACS to determine mitotic cell populations was as described (27Warrener R. Beamish H. Burgess A. Waterhouse N.J. Giles N. Fairlie D. Gabrielli B. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and cyclin B1 immunoprecipitated histone kinase assays were also performed as described previously (25Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. J.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6693-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, protein inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate supernatant was equalized for protein concentration and then precleared with 5 μg of nonimmune rabbit IgG coupled to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C with constant rocking. The cleared supernatants were incubated with 2–5 μg of PAK1 antibody for 4 h at 4 °C with constant rocking. Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with NETN, transferred to a fresh tube, and washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol. They were then assayed for PAK1 activity by addition of a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma), 0.2 mm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer and then resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE. The level of phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare).For immunofluorescence staining, cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine. After treatment, cells were either fixed with –20 °C methanol and stored at –20 °C or fixed briefly with –20 °C methanol/acetone for MAD2 staining as described previously (30Li Y. Benezra R. Science. 1996; 274: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Methanol-fixed cells were airdried and then rehydrated in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h, then incubated with primary antibody in rehydration buffer for 1 h at room temperature in a humidifier chamber. Coverslips were washed in 0.1% Blotto (0.1% skimmed milk powder in PBS) three times, followed by incubation with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min with 0.1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to stain DNA, and finally washed three times in PBS and then mounted onto glass slides. Micrographs were taken using a Zeiss Axioskop2 equipped with an AxioCam HD digital camera controlled with Axio Vision software.RESULTSCaffeine Induces Apoptosis in Mitosis following Escape from G2 Arrest—Caffeine addition to etoposide-arrested HeLa cells results in the rapid release from the G2 arrest and entry into mitosis by inhibiting ATM activity. Once the cells enter mitosis they would be expected to be delayed in mitosis because of DNA damage and inhibition of topoisomerase II by etoposide-blocking sister chromatid disjunction. Using time-lapse microscopy, we have followed entry into mitosis, characterized by the rounded mitotic phenotype, and apoptosis on the readily distinguishable extensive membrane blebbing under transmitted light microscopy (27Warrener R. Beamish H. Burgess A. Waterhouse N.J. Giles N. Fairlie D. Gabrielli B. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Addition of caffeine to etoposide-treated G2-arrested HeLa cells resulted in rapid entry into mitosis (Fig. 1A). We also observed delayed transit through mitosis. Normal HeLa mitosis is generally 60 min in duration. In etoposide- and caffeine-treated HeLa cells, this was extended to an average of 190 min, after which they died with the phenotypic appearance of apoptosis, without exiting mitosis. Addition of the checkpoint kinase chk1/chk2 inhibitor Gö6976 addition (31Kohn E.A. Yoo C.J. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 31-35PubMed Google Scholar) also induced rapid entry into mitosis, but the cells delayed longer in mitosis, averaging 250 min, before 30% of cells exited mitosis to form multinuclear cells. A lower level of apoptosis and a later onset were observed with Gö6976 compared with caffeine (Fig. 1A). When caffeine was washed out after 2 h and the fate of the cells driven into mitosis was followed, the level of apoptosis was found to be reduced and onset delayed to the same extent as treatment with Gö6976 (Fig. 1B). This observation suggested that, in addition to overcoming the G2 checkpoint arrest, caffeine was causing cells arrested in mitosis to undergo apoptosis. In the absence of either caffeine or Gö6976, <5% of cell entered mitosis or underwent apoptosis during the time course of the experiment (data not shown).FIGURE 1Caffeine accelerates cell death in G2 checkpoint-arrested cells. A, etoposide-arrested HeLa cells were treated with either caffeine (+caff) or Gö6976 (+Go) and then followed by time-lapse microscopy. Cells were scored for mitosis (top panel) and apoptosis (bottom panel). 100–200 cells were followed for each condition. The data are representative of two independent experiments. B, a similar experiment to A, and in this case caffeine was washed off after 2 h (caff w/o), and the mitotic cells at the time of wash off were followed and scored for apoptosis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Caffeine Initiates Apoptosis in Mitotic Checkpoint-arrested Cells—The mitotic arrest induced in etoposide and checkpoint inhibitor-treated cells was caused by the spindle assembly checkpoint blocking mitotic exit because of the block in topoisomerase II-dependent sister chromatid separation. To investigate the effect of caffeine on mitotic checkpoint-arrested cells, HeLa cells were treated overnight with nocodazole, and the mitotic cells collected by mechanical shake off had either caffeine added or were washed to remove the nocodazole and release them from the mitotic arrest. Removal of nocodazole resulted in the cells exiting mitosis and assuming a flattened interphase phenotype (Fig. 2A) within 2–3 h, with up to 60% of cells exiting mitosis by 5 h. Addition of caffeine to the nocodazole-arrested cells increased the proportion of cells displaying an apoptotic phenotype with membrane blebbing (27Warrener R. Beamish H. Burgess A. Waterhouse N.J. Giles N. Fairlie D. Gabrielli B. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Using flow cytometry, the proportion of cells with subdiploid DNA content increased from 20% in the nocodazole-arrested controls to 50% with 5 h of caffeine treatment, with a corresponding decrease in G2/M phase cells (Fig. 2B).The presence of a population of cells with subdiploid DNA and phenotypic appearance suggested that the cells were dying by apoptosis, a form of cell death in which DNA is fragmented following activation of caspase proteases. Consistent with this, addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk blocked the appearance of cells with <2n DNA content (Fig. 2C). Caffeine also induced caspase-dependent cleavage of PARP, an event that is typical of apoptosis that also was blocked by addition of Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2D). Cell death was blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2 (Fig. 2E). We also observed a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, indicated by loss of fluorescence of TMRE, a marker of intact mitochondria. This coincided with the relocation of cytoplasmic GFP-Bax, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, to a region that has previously been TMRE bright, presumably the mitochondria (Fig. 2F). These data demonstrate the involvement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in caffeine-induced cell death.The effect of caffeine was dependent on cells being arrested in mitosis as caffeine did not induce apoptosis in asynchronously growing cells (supplemental Fig. S1), and this was confirmed by time-lapse microscopy. Interestingly, there was no evidence of Bid cleavage, which we have observed previously associated with apoptosis in HeLa cells (29Burgess A. Ruefli A. Beamish H. Warrener R. Saunders N. Johnstone R. Gabrielli B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6693-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), or destruction of Survivin which has been implicated in a mitotic death mechanism (32O'Connor D.S. Wall N.R.

Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 2016-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1).Apoptosis Is Induced by Novel Targets of Caffeine—To determine whether the caffeine-induced apoptosis was because of the inhibition of known targets, inhibitors of ATM/ATR and PI 3-kinase wortmannin and LY294002, an inhibitor of the check-point kinases downstream of ATM/ATR Gö6976, and agents that elevated intracellular cAMP levels, dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin, were added individually to nocodazole-arrested cells, and the fate of individual cells was followed by time-lapse microscopy. These experiments revealed that caffeine induced >40% of the mitotic checkpoint arrest cells to undergo apoptosis within 6 h of addition compared with 10% apoptosis in the nocodazole only controls or addition of the checkpoint inhibitor Gö6976 (Fig. 3A). Wortmannin used at a concentration that inhibits ATM/ATR and PI 3-kinases (34Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar) induced <20% apoptosis at 6 h after treatment. The more specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 had a similar effect to wortmannin, whereas addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP or forskolin, which activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase in this system, had no effect over nocodazole only treatment (data not shown).FIGURE 3Known caffeine-sensitive pathways do not contribute to mitotic apoptosis. A, nocodazole-arrested HeLa cells were treated with either caffeine (caff), Gö6976 (Go), roscovitine (rosco), wortmannin (wort), or no addition (noco) and then followed by time-lapse microscopy. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis scored by their morphology was scored by following 100–200 cells in each treatment. These data are representative of at least three individual experiments. B, HeLa cells were transfected with either empty vector or vector expressing ATR shRNA, selected with puromycin for 2 days, and then arrested in nocodazole overnight. The cells were then treated either without or with ATM inhibitor (ATMi) and caffeine (caff), harvested at 6 h, and immunoblotted for then indicated proteins. Controls (Con) are puromycin-selected cells without further treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The loss of either ATM by mutation or deletion in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from ataxia telangiectasia patients or induced expression of dominant negative ATR in GM847 fibroblasts did not affect the level of apoptosis observed following nocodazole treatment when compared with the appropriated wild type or uninduced (data not shown). Specific knockdown of ATR in HeLa cells using an shRNA or inhibition of ATM using a specific small molecule inhibitor did not affect the ability of nocodazole to arrest cells in mitosis or to induce apoptosis (Fig. 3B). Combined ATR knockdown and ATM inhibition also failed to affect either mitotic arrest or induce apoptosis, whereas addition of caffeine initiated apoptosis even i"
https://openalex.org/W1968628309,"A eubacterial ribosome stalled on a defective mRNA can be released through a quality control mechanism referred to as trans-translation, which depends on the coordinating binding actions of transfer-messenger RNA, small protein B, and ribosome protein S1. By means of cryo-electron microscopy, we obtained a map of the complex composed of a stalled ribosome and small protein B, which appears near the decoding center. This result suggests that, when lacking a codon, the A-site on the small subunit is a target for small protein B. To investigate the role of S1 played in trans-translation, we obtained a cryo-electron microscopic map, including a stalled ribosome, transfer-messenger RNA, and small protein Bs but in the absence of S1. In this complex, several connections between the 30 S subunit and transfer-messenger RNA that appear in the +S1 complex are no longer found. We propose the unifying concept of scaffolding for the roles of small protein B and S1 in binding of transfer-messenger RNA to the ribosome during trans-translation, and we infer a pathway of sequential binding events in the initial phase of trans-translation. A eubacterial ribosome stalled on a defective mRNA can be released through a quality control mechanism referred to as trans-translation, which depends on the coordinating binding actions of transfer-messenger RNA, small protein B, and ribosome protein S1. By means of cryo-electron microscopy, we obtained a map of the complex composed of a stalled ribosome and small protein B, which appears near the decoding center. This result suggests that, when lacking a codon, the A-site on the small subunit is a target for small protein B.

Williams K.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D104-D108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the secondary structure of the TLD is very similar to that of a canonical tRNA, it lacks an anticodon loop, possesses a reduced D-domain, and the x-ray structure shows an increased interstem angle at the elbow level (120° versus 90°) (2Stagg S.M. Frazer-Abel A.A. Hagerman P.J. Harvey S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Gutmann S. Haebel P.W. Metzinger L. Sutter M. Felden B. Ban N. Nature. 2003; 424: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). SmpB (small protein B) is a basic protein interacting with tmRNA during trans-translation (4Karzai A.W. Susskind M.M. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3793-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Its gene is conserved among prokaryotes, and its deletion causes phenotypes similar to those observed when tmRNA is inactivated. The process of trans-translation has been described as follows (5Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 6: 449-455Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 6Saguy M. Gillet R. Metzinger L. Felden B. Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The TLD in tmRNA is aminoacylated with an alanine, and then the complex of tmRNA, SmpB, and EF-Tu binds to the stalled ribosome, characterized by the absence of a stop codon in the A-site because of a defective mRNA. Subsequent insertion of the ORF into the ribosome and its complete translation, which requires the presence of protein S1 in solution, leads to the release of both the tagged polypeptide to be degraded and the stalled ribosome to be recycled. An earlier cryo-EM study (7Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishnan V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) identified the position of the pseudoknots and the TLD in tmRNA, as well as a single copy of SmpB. Some portions of the density map were less well resolved, leaving ambiguities in the path of ORF and the number of SmpBs. Both ambiguities were recently resolved by an improved cryo-EM map (8Kaur S. Gillet R. Li W. Gursky R. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16484-16489Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whose interpretation could take advantage of new x-ray data on a complex between SmpB and TLD (3Gutmann S. Haebel P.W. Metzinger L. Sutter M. Felden B. Ban N. Nature. 2003; 424: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Accordingly, two SmpB molecules were identified, one (SmpB-2) bound in the decoding site and the other (SmpB-1) perched at the GTPase-associated center. This result is in line with the earlier suggestion by Wower et al. (9Wower J. Zwieb C.W. Hoffman D.W. Wower I.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8826-8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that several SmpB molecules might interact with tmRNA, both on its CCA stem and its pseudo-anticodon stem. Indeed, a recent biochemical study demonstrates that during trans-translation in vivo, two SmpBs interact with the stalled ribosome, one with the small and one with the large subunit of a stalled ribosome (10Hallier M. Desreac J. Felden B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). According to the biochemical data (11Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Takagi M. Inokuchi H. Himeno H. Muto A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1620-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 12Shimizu Y. Ueda T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), SmpB primarily has three functions as follows: (i) facilitation of the binding of tmRNA to the ribosomes; (ii) enhancement of tmRNA alanylation by the alanyl-tRNA synthetase; and (iii) protection of tmRNA from degradation. Essentially, no trans-translation can be triggered in the absence of SmpB. The finding of two copies of SmpB bound to the stalled ribosome raised questions on functional identity of the two SmpBs and the sequence in which the binding occurs in the initiation of trans-translation. This study takes a cue from the in vivo study by Hallier et al. (13Hallier M. Ivanova N. Rametti A. Pavlov M. Ehrenberg M. Felden B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) who found that SmpB can bind to the stalled ribosome independently from the presence of tmRNA, suggesting that the stalled ribosome is first targeted by SmpB and that this might be the first step of trans-translation. However, the questions that remained to be addressed are as follows. 1) When SmpB binds to the stalled ribosome independently, then where precisely is its binding position? 2) Given the binding position of the SmpB on the stalled ribosome, what is the likely mechanism of the targeting of the ribosome by tmRNA? 3) Which of the two molecules of SmpB, which are associated with the ribosome-bound tmRNA according to Kaur et al. (8Kaur S. Gillet R. Li W. Gursky R. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16484-16489Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), is used to protect free tmRNA from degradation? In an effort to address these questions, we used cryo-EM to study two complexes, one obtained by incubating SmpB with stalled ribosomes and the other (the control) with nonstalled ribosomes that had a sense codon in the A-site. Comparison of these maps revealed the presence of SmpB at the decoding site of the stalled ribosome, roughly in the position of SmpB-2 as defined by Kaur et al. (8Kaur S. Gillet R. Li W. Gursky R. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16484-16489Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that the presence of a codon in the A-site prevents the binding of SmpB. This result gives a rationale as to why SmpB does not interfere with canonical translation. Furthermore, to elucidate the role played by the ribosomal protein S1 in solution during this early step of trans-translation, we also obtained a cryo-EM reconstruction (at a resolution of 13 Ä) of a stalled ribosome bound with tmRNA, EF-Tu-GDP, and SmpB in a pre-accommodated state but in the absence of S1. In this map, the ORF in the tmRNA is well structured and continuous outside the decoding center, unlike the discontinuous, disrupted structure seen in the presence of S1. Following the study by Kaur et al. (8Kaur S. Gillet R. Li W. Gursky R. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16484-16489Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), this study was aimed at determining the roles of both SmpB and S1 in the assembly and function of the trans-translation complex. Our findings can be summarized by one unifying concept, the concept of scaffolding. Trans-translation, specifically the formation of a productive tmRNA structure, ORF insertion into the mRNA channel, and TLD insertion into the A-site all appear to be mediated and controlled by these structural proteins. Preparation of Components and Formation of SmpB-Ribosome Complexes—Thermus thermophilus ribosomes were prepared as described previously (14Clemons Jr., W.M. Brodersen D.E. McCutcheon J.P. May J.L. Carter A.P. Morgan-Warren R.J. Wimberly B.T. Ramakrishnan V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 827-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). C-terminal His-tagged SmpB was overexpressed in Escherichia coli using the T7 expression system and isolated by Ni2+ precharged Hi-Trap chelating column, according to the manufacturer’s procedures (Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France). Ribosomal P-site tRNA complexes were obtained by incubating 70 S ribosomes (1 μm) with 2 μm of mRNA consisting of the sequence GGCAAGGAGGUAAAAAUG for the stalled one and UCGAGAAGGAGAAGCUUAUGGUGACCUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCC for the nonstalled, and E. coli fMet-tRNAfMet (2 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C in a 48-μl medium containing 5 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgOAc, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol. An initiation complex, including an SD sequence, an AUG on the mRNA, and an initiator tRNA, was used to simulate a rescue complex because it gives a stable complex that mimics a stalling situation in the most simple case. Complexes were then obtained by adding SmpB (4 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C. No S1 was used in the complexes. Pre-accommodated complexes in the absence of the ribosomal protein S1 were prepared as described earlier (7Valle M. Gillet R. Kaur S. Henne A. Ramakrishnan V. Frank J. Science. 2003; 300: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Equilibrium Binding Measurement by Filter Binding—Ribosome-SmpB complexes (100 μl) were applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare, Orsay, France) equilibrated with 5 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgOAc, 50 mm KCl, at 4 °C. The fractions containing the purified 70 S ribosome were pooled and concentrated. In vitro transcribed tmRNA was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and phage T4 polynucleotide kinase after dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase. Following purification (Megaclear, Ambion, Austin, TX) and ethanol precipitation, tmRNA was denatured for 2 min at 80 °C in a folding buffer (5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5) and slowly cooled down to room temperature for 30 min before being applied to the SmpB-ribosome complexes described above. 1 μl of labeled tmRNA was added to the ribosomal complexes for either 2 or 5 min (similar results) at 20 °C, in a total volume of 15 μl in a buffer containing (5 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgOAc, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol). 13 μl were then filtered under vacuum suction over nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell), followed by rapid washing with 3× 1 ml of the same cold buffer. Membranes were dried, and the holding radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting (Wallac 1409). Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation and Analysis— Crude ribosomes from E. coli were obtained as described previously (13Hallier M. Ivanova N. Rametti A. Pavlov M. Ehrenberg M. Felden B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 70 S ribosomes were dissociated into 50 S and 30 S subunits by diluting the crude ribosome with a 10-fold volume of Mg2+-free lysis buffer. Ribosome subunits were fractionated on a 10–30% sucrose gradient in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm magnesium acetate for 15 h at 27,000 rpm and at 4 °C. RNAs were isolated from one-half of each fraction by phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. For Northern hybridization, RNAs were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing 6.5% (v/v) formaldehyde and transferred in 10 × SSC to nylon membrane by the capillary method. Pre-hybridization and hybridization with 32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotides complementary to Ssra RNA (5′-CGG GTA CGG GTA GGA TCG CAC ACC-3′) were carried out in ExpressHyb according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Clontech). For Western blot, proteins were extracted by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, electrophoresed on a 15% acrylamide Tris-glycine gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. SmpB was then detected by using a rabbit polyclonal antibody as described previously (13Hallier M. Ivanova N. Rametti A. Pavlov M. Ehrenberg M. Felden B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cryo-electron Microscopy and Image Processing—Ribosomal samples were diluted to a final concentration of 32 nm and used directly for cryo-EM grid preparation following standard procedures. Micrographs at ×50,000 (±2%) magnification were taken on a Philips FEI (Eindhoven, The Netherlands) Tecnai F20 with field emission gun operated at 200 kV and with a low electron dose (∼15 e- Ä-2). The micrographs were scanned with a pixel size corresponding to 2.82 Ä on the object scale with a Zeiss Imaging scanner (Z/I Imaging Corp., Huntsville, AL). The image processing was carried out with the SPIDER package (15Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Oxford University Press, New York2006Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar), including a reference-guided projection classification and alignment, contrast transfer function correction of segregated defocus groups, and correction of the high frequency amplitudes using low angle x-ray scattering data (16Gabashvili I.S. Agrawal R.K. Spahn C.M. Grassucci R.A. Svergun D.I. Frank J. Penczek P. Cell. 2000; 100: 537-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The numbers of particles used in the three-dimensional reconstructions were 48,138, 52,829, and 31,731 for the 70 S·tRNA with a sense codon in the A-site, the 70 S·tRNA·SmpB lacking a codon in the A-site, and the 70 S·tRNA·tmRNA·EF-Tu·SmpB·kir lacking a sense codon in the A-site and in the absence of S1 for a pre-accommodated complex, respectively. The map resolutions were 10, 11.8, and 13.1 Ä, respectively, using a 0.5 cutoff in the Fourier shell correlation. The docking of atomic model of tmRNA into the cryo-EM maps was done using O, and the visualization was performed using IRIS Explorer (Numerical Algorithm Group Ltd., Downers Grove, IL), Ribbons (17Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 103-106Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar), and INSIGHT II (Accelrys Inc., San Diego). Binding of SmpB to the Stalled Ribosome—Our study was motivated by the finding, using biochemical methods, that SmpB binds the stalled 70 S ribosome in the absence of tmRNA (13Hallier M. Ivanova N. Rametti A. Pavlov M. Ehrenberg M. Felden B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), suggesting that this binding may be an initial step of transtranslation. We set out to visualize this binding complex by means of cryo-EM and single particle reconstruction (15Frank J. Three-dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Oxford University Press, New York2006Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Two cryo-EM samples were made by incubating SmpB protein with the 70 S ribosome, tRNA, and two different mRNAs, one bearing a stop codon at the A-site and the other lacking any codon at the A-site (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both SmpB and the ribosome were from T. thermophilus. By using these two samples, two cryo-EM maps were produced, at resolutions of 10 and 11.8 Ä, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). These two maps promised to provide a comparison for binding of SmpB under the two conditions. The difference between the two maps proved to be an extra piece of density located at the decoding center of the ribosome (Fig. 1). This density indicates high (close to 100%) occupancy of a protein ligand. To ascertain SmpB as the origin, its atomic structure (PDB 1P6V) was fitted into the cryo-EM map by visual criteria, leading to a good match with the map in both size and shape (Fig. 2). We regard this result as a positive identification of SmpB, which was confirmed by Western blot analyses using anti-SmpB antibodies (not shown). The x-ray structure shows long random coils in both the N and C termini. In addition, residues 73–76 are missing in the x-ray structure, which leave the two disconnected ends less structured. In addition to the overall match between the density of the current cryo-EM map and the x-ray structure, the best candidate orientation of this SmpB can be inferred by comparing it with the SmpB bound to the A-site (i.e. SmpB-2) in the complex with tmRNA (8Kaur S. Gillet R. Li W. Gursky R. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16484-16489Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Placing the SmpB at the position and orientation of SmpB-2 in the tmRNA-SmpBs model leads to a fairly good match with the current cryo-EM map. Thus, our cryo-EM results indicate that SmpB is recognized by the stalled ribosome but not by the ribosome encountering a stop codon in the A-site in the process of normal translation. In the fitting position, SmpB fills the space near the decoding center. Based on this fitting position, the potential binding sites are on different sides of the molecule and include the position for normal A-site codon, helix 44 of the 30 S subunit, which are known to participate actively in the decoding process during normal translation (18Ogle J.M. Murphy F.V. Tarry M.J. Ramakrishnan V. Cell. 2002; 111: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), the TLD domain of tmRNA in the preaccommodation complex, as well as the other SmpB oriented toward the 50 S subunit. As described by Dong et al. (19Dong G. Nowakowski J. Hoffman D.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), conserved amino acids in SmpB are distributed on different sides of the molecule, exposing more than one potential intermolecular binding site. This suggestion thus fits our current observation. The orientation of the SmpB seems plausible in facilitating the entry of tmRNA into the ribosome (see “Discussion”). To check this hypothesis and to investigate further the contribution by stalled ribosomes to SmpB recognition, measurements of the binding of tmRNA to the ribosomal complexes described above were carried out by filter-binding assays (20Cochella L. Green R. Science. 2005; 308: 1178-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The complexes were loaded on a gel filtration Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) to eliminate the free fraction of SmpB that could interfere with tmRNA. Equilibrium dissociation experiments were then carried out between radiolabeled tmRNA and each of the purified complexes (see “Experimental Procedures”). According to the data, tmRNA binds to stalled ribosomes once the empty A-site has been recognized and occupied by SmpB (Fig. 3; compare curves with squares to diamonds). Experiments Related to the Assembly Pathway—To ascertain specificity of SmpB for an empty A-site, a control experiment was carried out by preparing a sample in which all conditions are kept the same, except for placement of a sense codon at the A-site (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1C). Despite the presence of SmpB in the initial mix, tmRNA is apparently unable to target the stalled ribosome (Fig. 3, open squares). Altogether, these results confirm the cryo-EM data (Fig. 1) showing that SmpB binds exclusively to stalled ribosomes bearing an empty A-site, thereby facilitating their subsequent interaction with tmRNA. Our cryo-EM study and the finding by Hallier et al. (13Hallier M. Ivanova N. Rametti A. Pavlov M. Ehrenberg M. Felden B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) agree with the result that in the absence of tmRNA one SmpB molecule binds stably to the stalled 70 S ribosome and that this molecule is found on the 30 S subunit. We designed biochemical experiments to investigate whether or not this 30 S·mRNA·SmpB complex has any relevance in vivo and whether under these conditions SmpB molecules strongly bind with tmRNA. Translating 70 S ribosomes were purified in vivo and dissociated into their large and small subunits on a sucrose density gradient at a low salt concentration (Fig. 4A). After gel separation, the 23 S and 16 S ribosomal RNA were detected by ethidium bromide staining, allowing a correct matching of the two subunits extracts on the gel (Fig. 4B). tmRNA and SmpB distribution were monitored in each fraction by Northern and Western blots, respectively. Dissociation of the two subunits releases tmRNA from the ribosomes to the soluble fraction (Fig. 4C). tmRNA was not detected in the 50 S or in the 30 S subunits. Using an antibody raised against SmpB, immunoblots of these fractions indicate that, in the same way, the protein mostly co-sediments with tmRNA outside the separated ribosomal subunits. The SmpB protein coming from a mixture containing ribosomes in all stages of trans-translation is released with tmRNA, whereas a small portion of SmpB bound alone to the stalled ribosomes is found associated with the 30 S fraction (Fig. 4D). These results confirm that in vivo one SmpB molecule binds to a fraction of the stalled 70 S ribosomes on the small subunit and, furthermore, that once the trans-translating complex is formed, tmRNA and two SmpB molecules form a strong association that even persists after forced subunit dissociation. Given the fact that two copies of SmpB are found in the stalled trans-translating 70 S ribosome (8Kaur S. Gillet R. Li W. Gursky R. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16484-16489Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Hallier M. Desreac J. Felden B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the assembly of the trans-translating complex brings two SmpBs in close contact so that they form a structural scaffold. SmpB Forms a Binding Framework for tmRNA—The in vitro experiment demonstrates that when tmRNA is present, two molecules of SmpB on the 70 S ribosome are required for trans-translation (13Hallier M. Ivanova N. Rametti A. Pavlov M. Ehrenberg M. Felden B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25978-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). One is tightly bound to the 30 S subunit, whereas the other contacts the large subunit transiently (10Hallier M. Desreac J. Felden B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a recent cryo-EM reconstruction at higher resolution has identified density for two molecules of SmpB in a pre-accommodated state as follows: the one depicted above (SmpB-2) and the other directed toward the large subunit (SmpB-1) (8Kaur S. Gillet R. Li W. Gursky R. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16484-16489Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). On the side view depicted in Fig. 5, interacting regions of the two SmpB proteins with the TLD portion of tmRNA are emphasized. Both SmpB proteins interact with tmRNA such that the two molecules come in close contact (Fig. 5). Although SmpB-2 binds the elbow region of the TLD in tmRNA as shown in the x-ray structure (3Gutmann S. Haebel P.W. Metzinger L. Sutter M. Felden B. Ban N. Nature. 2003; 424: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), as well as the CCA arm as shown in our model, SmpB-1 interacts with the T stem-loop (Fig. 5). In addition, SmpB-1 contacts SmpB-2 through the unstructured C terminus of SmpB-1. In the fitting position (3Gutmann S. Haebel P.W. Metzinger L. Sutter M. Felden B. Ban N. Nature. 2003; 424: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the bi-lobed shape of the density for SmpB-1 near the 50 S subunit was fitted quite well by placing β4-β5 and β7-α3 into the two lobes. However, this placement causes noticeable overlap between the C terminus of SmpB-1 and the T stemloop. In the model shown in Fig. 5, the x-ray position of the C terminus (residues 125–130) is highlighted to indicate that we are dealing with a highly flexible portion of the molecule, so that concerns about the overlap may be moot. In addition, we made a slight adjustment for the position of SmpB-1 to release some residual regional overlapping. Furthermore, we noticed that the bi-lobed shape of the density can also be fitted by a position of the x-ray structure related to the current position through rotation by 180° about an axis normal to the plane of the figure, but this would remove the potential dimeric contact via C-terminal binding. It is hoped that a future higher resolution map will provide a decisive answer for the position of SmpB-1. Intriguingly, when monitoring the interactions of SmpB with a full-length thermophile tmRNA, not all the footprints identified on the TLD are clustered around the 3′ end of the D-loop (21Metzinger L. Hallier M. Felden B.

Additional protections are in the T stem and loop, reflecting either indirect changes because of a rearrangement of the binding to the elbow or a direct interaction between the protein and the RNA, as suggested by the position of SmpB-1 in our model. In the same way, a combination of enzymatic probing and UV cross-linking experiments indicates that the acceptor and T arms constitute a major binding site for SmpB (9Wower J. Zwieb C.W. Hoffman D.W. Wower I.K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8826-8836Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus the two SmpB proteins surrounding the TLD create a stable scaffold that allows the RNA to be connected with two essential structural elements of the ribosome as follows: the decoding site on the small subunit and the GTPase-associated center on the large subunit. Both biochemical data and the structural evidence depicted here strengthen the idea of the SmpB molecules forming a protein scaffold that provides a stabilizing framework for the flexible tmRNA molecule on the ribosome, allowing its accurate positioning and tuning of its activity. Regulation of tmRNA Activity by Ribosomal Protein S1—The crucial role played by SmpB in scaffolding tmRNA into an active conformation for aminoacylation and recognition by the ribosome raises the question about the involvement of the other protein partners during the process. Among these, the role of ribosomal protein S1 is still not completely understood despite numerous studies. Two recent studies have suggested that S1 might play a role at a stage prior to the re"

The protein Geminin is thought to prevent a second round of DNA replication by inhibiting the essential replication factor Cdt1. Geminin also affects the development of several different organs by binding and inhibiting transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling proteins. It is not known if the defects in Geminin-deficient organisms are due to overreplication or to effects on cell differentiation. We previously reported that Geminin depletion in Xenopus causes early embryonic lethality due to a Chk1-dependent G2 cell cycle arrest just after the midblastula transition. Here we report that expressing a non-Geminin-binding Cdt1 mutant in Xenopus embryos exactly reproduces the phenotype of geminin depletion. Expressing the same mutant in replication extracts induces a partial second round of DNA replication within a single S phase. We conclude that Geminin is required to suppress a second round of DNA replication in vivo and that the phenotype of Geminin-depleted Xenopus embryos is caused by abnormal Cdt1 regulation. Expressing a nondegradable Cdt1 mutant in embryos also reproduces the Geminin-deficient phenotype. In cell extracts, the nondegradable mutant has no effect by itself but augments the amount of rereplication observed when Geminin is depleted. We conclude that Cdt1 is regulated both by Geminin binding and by degradation. To maintain a stable genome, it is essential that replication origins fire only once per cell cycle.

We conclude that Cdt1 is regulated both by Geminin binding and by degradation. To maintain a stable genome, each origin of replication must initiate DNA synthesis only once in every cell cycle. If even a small number of replication origins were to fire more than once, cells would slowly accumulate more and more DNA every time they divided. Moreover, if the reduplicated region encompassed the centromere, the chromosome would either missegregate or break during mitosis. Rereplication would have such disastrous consequences that cells have evolved multiple redundant mechanisms to ensure that it virtually never occurs. Polyploid cells, such as placental trophoblasts or megakaryocytes, are produced by repeated successive S phases rather than by rereplication within a single S phase (1Edgar B.A. Orr-Weaver T.L. Cell. 2001; 105: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Rereplication is prevented by controlling the assembly of prereplication complex (pre-RC), 2The abbreviations used are: Pre-RC, prereplication complex; BrdUTP, 5′-bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: Pre-RC, prereplication complex; BrdUTP, 5′-bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate; WT, wild type. a collection of essential replication factors that forms on origins of replication during late G1 phase (2Blow J.J. Dutta A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In metazoans, replication is restricted to one round per cell cycle through regulation of a single pre-RC component, Cdt1. Cdt1 is required for incorporation of the Mcm2–7 helicase into pre-RC (3Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The inhibitory protein Geminin is thought to prevent rereplication by regulating Cdt1. Geminin binds tightly to Cdt1 and seems to inhibit it in a stoichiometric fashion (4Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 5Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Geminin accumulates during S and G2 phase and is quickly destroyed at the metaphase/anaphase transition by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (6McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). This pattern suggests that Geminin prevents rereplication during S and G2 phase and then is destroyed during mitosis to allow replication in the next cell cycle. Nevertheless, depletion of Geminin from Xenopus egg replication extracts does not consistently result in a second round of DNA synthesis (6McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 7Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Li A. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cdt1 is also destroyed by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis during S phase in a manner that is dependent upon origin firing (7Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 10Nishitani H. Taraviras S.

Several groups have recently reported that reinitiation of DNA synthesis occurs in Xenopus egg replication extracts when Geminin is depleted and protein degradation is inhibited with proteasome inhibitors, whereas neither treatment by itself has any effect (7Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Li A. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Maiorano D. Krasinska L. Lutzmann M. Mechali M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 146-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was not determined whether stabilization of Cdt1 itself was responsible for rereplication in these experiments. The phenotypes of Geminin-deficient organisms call into question whether Geminin has a physiological role in preventing rereplication in vivo. Neither budding nor fission yeast contain a clear Geminin homolog, yet rereplication is adequately prevented by other mechanisms (13Nguyen V.Q. Co C. Li J.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 1068-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Caenorhabditis elegans embryos treated with Geminin small interfering RNA develop normally to adulthood and do not exhibit a general cell cycle defect (14Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Tsuyama T. Tada S. Iida Y. Sugimoto A. Eki T. Enomoto T. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19689-19694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A few cells show anaphase chromosome bridges that may result from rereplication at the centromere. Drosophila embryos carrying P-element insertions in the Geminin gene die at the third instar larval stage (15Quinn L.M. Herr A. McGarry T.J. Richardson H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2741-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As in C. elegans, there is no generalized cell cycle defect, but there are some indications of aberrant DNA replication, including occasional cells with anaphase chromosome bridges and prolonged DNA replication in cells that normally endoreplicate their DNA and become polyploid. In contrast to these invertebrates, Xenopus embryos that are depleted of Geminin abruptly stop dividing after the 13th cell division (16McGarry T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3662-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The arrest occurs immediately after the midblastula transition, the point in development when the cell cycle slows and zygotic gene expression first begins. The cell cycle arrest is caused by activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk1; inhibition of Chk1 by expressing a dominant negative mutant suppresses the arrest. Although overreplication could cause this phenotype, the amount of DNA in the arrested cells is normal. Mouse embryos homozygous for a targeted deletion of the Geminin gene arrest at the eight-cell stage (17Gonzalez M.A. Tachibana K.E. Adams D.J. van der Weyden L. Hemberger M. Coleman N. Bradley A. Laskey R.A. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1880-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of the cells in Geminin-deficient embryos are of the trophoblast lineage. These normally polyploid cells had a greater DNA content when Geminin was absent, reminiscent of the Drosophila phenotype. In two-hybrid assays, Geminin has recently been found to bind to several different transcription factors and chromatin-remodeling proteins (18Del Bene F. Tessmar-Raible K. Wittbrodt J. Nature. 2004; 427: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19Kroll K.L. Salic A.N. Evans L.M. Kirschner M.W. Development. 1998; 125: 3247-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Luo L.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1723-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Modest increases or decreases in Geminin expression can affect the development of specific tissues, organs, or embryonic segments in ways that suggest that Geminin inhibits these proteins. In light of these studies, Geminin is proposed to inhibit cell differentiation until cell proliferation ceases. In this study, we sought to determine whether Geminin is required to prevent rereplication in Xenopus embryos and whether the phenotype of Geminin depletion is due to abnormal DNA replication or to an effect on cell differentiation. Plasmid Construction—Cdt1 deletion mutants were generated by PCR amplification using pBluescript-Cdt1 as a template (3Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Fragments were inserted between the XhoI and XbaI sites of either pCS2 for untagged constructs or pCS2-MT for Myc-tagged constructs. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). Antibodies—To make anti-Cdt1 antibody, full-length Xenopus Cdt1 was amplified by PCR and inserted between the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET28(a). The product plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 and Cdt1 production was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cdt1 inclusion bodies were purified by centrifugation and used to immunize rabbits (Covance). Anti-Cdt1 antibodies were affinity-purified from crude immune serum using a column of renatured Cdt1 protein covalently bound to cyanogen bromide-Sepharose. To make the affinity resin, Cdt1 was purified from inclusion bodies on nickel-agarose columns under denaturing conditions according to standard techniques (Qiagen). The protein was renatured by diluting it 20-fold into renaturation buffer (55 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 10.56 mm NaCl, 0.44 mm KCl, 550 mm guanidium HCl, 2.2 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 550 mm l-arginine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubating at 4 °C overnight. Renatured Cdt1 was covalently attached to cyanogen bromide-Sepharose using standard techniques (22Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1988; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). Anti-Geminin antibody was described previously (6McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-345 Chk1 antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Immunoblots were performed using standard methods. For quantitative immunoblots, the two samples that were to be compared were serially diluted 1:2, and the relative intensity of the bands was compared visually. DNA Replication Assays—S-phase replication extracts were prepared from ionophore-activated Xenopus eggs as described (23McGarry T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 296: 263-278PubMed Google Scholar). Metaphase extracts were prepared from unactivated eggs. The eggs were incubated in MMR containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 15 min prior to activation. All solutions used thereafter and the final extract were supplemented with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. Extract was prepared fresh for each experiment. Extract was immunodepleted of Cdt1 using one-tenth volume Affiprep beads (Bio-Rad) coated with affinity-purified Cdt1 antibody (1 μg of antibody/1 μl of beads). Extract was immunodepleted of Geminin using one-twentieth volume Affiprep beads coated with anti-Geminin antibody (2 μgof antibody/1 μl of beads). Two sequential depletions were performed at 4 °C for 1 h each with tumbling. Cdt1-depleted extracts were supplemented with one-tenth volume of Cdt1 protein that had been translated in reticulocyte lysate. Replication reactions containing demembranated sperm template and [α-32P]dATP were carried out at room temperature using standard procedures (23McGarry T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 296: 263-278PubMed Google Scholar). Total DNA synthesis was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and scintillation counting of incorporated 32P. Density substitution reactions were carried out in the same way, except that the reaction also contained 400 μm BrdUTP (Sigma). Cesium chloride gradients were performed using published procedures (24Hutchison C.J. Fantes P. Brooks R. The Cell Cycle: A Practical Approach. 1993: 188-189Google Scholar), except that before loading the gradient the samples were digested with RNase A and EcoRI. The percentage of rereplication was calculated as the number of counts in the heavy-heavy peak divided by the number of counts in the heavy-light peak multiplied by 100. We found that the amount of rereplication induced by a given mutant was variable from extract to extract. When two mutants were to be compared, they were always analyzed in the same extract. The experiment was repeated multiple times using different extracts, and the paired Student’s t test was used to calculate p values. Individual experiments were excluded from analysis if the amount of replication was less than 25% of an untreated control reaction. To measure Cdt1 ubiquitylation, replication extracts were supplemented with 4 μm methylated ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), and chromatin was isolated as previously described (7Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Protein Binding Assays—RNAs encoding Myc-tagged Cdt1 proteins were synthesized in vitro using SP6 polymerase and injected into stage VI oocytes. Oocyte maturation was induced with 2 μm water-soluble progesterone (Sigma). Oocytes that underwent germinal vesicle break down were homogenized in Embryo Extract Buffer (80 mm β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 20 mm EGTA), and particulates were removed by centrifugation. Myc-Cdt1 was precipitated from the cleared lysate with Myc antibody-coated protein A beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and the precipitates were washed sequentially with Embryo Extract Buffer and then with Immunoprecipitation Wash Buffer (50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin), all at room temperature. The precipitates were separated on polyacrylamide gels and blotted for Geminin or Myc using standard procedures. Embryo and Oocyte Injection—Stage VI Xenopus oocytes and two-cell embryos were injected with RNA or anti-Geminin oligonucleotide using published procedures (25Heasman J. Holwill S. Wylie C.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 213-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When the injected embryos reached stage 10.5, they were blindly scored for sectors showing a cell cycle arrest and then homogenized in Embryo Extract Buffer for immunoblot analysis. The Phenotype of Geminin-depleted Embryos Is Reproduced by Expressing a Non-Geminin-binding Cdt1 Mutant—If the phenotype of Geminin depletion is caused by increased Cdt1 activity, then it should be reproduced by expressing a Cdt1 mutant that is not regulated by Geminin. To map the site on Xenopus Cdt1 that binds Geminin, we constructed a panel of Myc-tagged Cdt1 deletion mutants (Fig. 1A). RNA encoding each mutant was injected into stage VI Xenopus oocytes, and the synthesis of Geminin and Cdt1 was induced with progesterone. Myc-Cdt1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody, and the amount of Geminin in the precipitate was determined by immunoblotting. Geminin was precipitated from lysates of oocytes expressing full-length Myc-Cdt1 but not from lysates of uninjected oocytes or oocytes co-injected with both Myc-Cdt1 RNA and antisense Geminin oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–4). Geminin also co-precipitated with all Cdt1 deletion mutants that included amino acids 236–253 but not with mutants that lacked this region. These results indicate that the Geminin binding site on Cdt1 lies between amino acids 236 and 253. This region includes the sequence KAPAYQRF (amino acids 241–248), which is highly conserved among Cdt1 orthologs from different species and has been shown to be part of the Geminin binding site in mouse and human Cdt1 (26Lee C. Hong B. Choi J.M. Kim Y. Watanabe S. Ishimi Y. Enomoto T. Tada S. Cho Y. Nature. 2004; 430: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 27Saxena S. Yuan P. Dhar S.K. Senga T. Takeda D. Robinson H. Kornbluth S. Swaminathan K. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 245-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mouse Cdt1 has a secondary Geminin binding site at sequences corresponding to Xenopus amino acids 386–399, but we could not detect binding to this region in our assay (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8). We constructed a non-Geminin-binding mutant, Cdt1NGB, by mutating the KAPAYQRF sequence to AAAAAAAA. Geminin does not bind to Cdt1NGB when both are expressed in oocytes (Fig. 1B, lane 14). To see if Cdt1NGB is active, we immunodepleted endogenous Cdt1 from replication extracts made from Xenopus eggs and added back either Cdt1NGB or Cdt1WT that had been translated in reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 1C). Cdt1-depleted extracts do not show any replication above background, whereas mock-depleted extracts show the same amount of DNA synthesis as untreated extracts. Adding back either Cdt1WT or Cdt1NGB restores replication to normal levels (Fig. 1D). Adding recombinant Geminin to the extract completely inhibits the replication activity of Cdt1WT but does not affect the activity of Cdt1NGB (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that Cdt1NGB is fully active and is not inhibited by Geminin. We next tested to see if expressing Cdt1NGB in early embryos would reproduce the phenotype of Geminin depletion. We previously showed that depleting Geminin with antisense oligonucleotides causes a cell cycle arrest at the last blastula stage (16McGarry T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3662-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When one blastomere of a 2–4-cell embryo is injected, the arrest is manifest as a sector of abnormally large cells at the injection site (Fig. 2A). The arrest is caused by activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk1, which can be detected on immunoblots by increased phosphorylation at serine 345 using a phosphospecific antibody (Fig. 2D) (16McGarry T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3662-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Benjamin J.M. Torke S.J. Demeler B. McGarry T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45957-45968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We injected two-cell Xenopus embryos with 300 pg of RNA encoding either Cdt1WT or the non-Geminin-binding mutant Cdt1NGB. As a positive control, embryos were injected with anti-Geminin morpholino oligonucleotides. Immunoblots confirmed that Cdt1WT and Cdt1NGB were expressed equally (Fig. 2D). When the embryos reached the late blastula stage, we calculated the percentage of injections that produced a sector of abnormally large cells. Expressing Cdt1NGB induced arrested sectors in 59% of injections, whereas expressing Cdt1WT induced arrested sectors in just 3% (Fig. 2B). Embryos injected with Cdt1NGB RNA also showed a high level of Ser345-phosphorylated Chk1, whereas embryos injected with Cdt1WT did not show any increase above background (Fig. 2D). Because expression of a Cdt1 mutant that is not regulated by Geminin reproduces the phenotype caused by Geminin depletion, we conclude that the phenotype of Geminin-depleted embryos is due to improperly regulated Cdt1 activity. Injecting anti-Geminin oligonucleotides induced a cell cycle arrest in 100% of the injected embryos and induced a greater degree of Chk1 phosphorylation than Cdt1NGB. We attribute this difference to the more extensive diffusion of the antisense oligonucleotide throughout all parts of the injected embryo. Injection of RNA encoding the inactive mutant Cdt1C479 (29Ferenbach A. Li A. Brito-Martins M. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) neither caused a cell cycle arrest nor induced Chk1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, B and D). This indicates that the overexpressed proteins are not acting in a dominant-negative fashion. A Nondegradable Cdt1 Mutant Also Reproduces the Phenotype of Geminin Depletion—During S phase, Cdt1 activity is removed both by Geminin binding and by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (7Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 10Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 30807-30816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We next tested to see if expressing a nondegradable Cdt1 mutant would also reproduce the phenotype of Geminin depletion. Degradation of human Cdt1 requires a QXRVTDF sequence near the amino terminus and an RRL sequence located further downstream (9Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 11Senga T. Sivaprasad U. Zhu W. Park J.H. Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6246-6252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Both these sequences are found in the first 150 amino acids of Xenopus Cdt1 (Fig. 1A). We deleted the first 150 amino acids of Xenopus Cdt1 to create a nondegradable mutant, Cdt1N150. Cdt1N150 restores replication to Cdt1-depleted extract and is inhibited by the same concentration of Geminin as Cdt1WT (Fig. 1, C and D). To check its stability, Cdt1N150 was translated in vitro and added back to Cdt1-depleted replication extract containing sperm DNA template. At various times, the amount of Cdt1 remaining was determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). Endogenous Cdt1 is degraded with a half-life of about 40 min, as described previously (7Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In vitro-translated Cdt1WT is degraded with about the same half-life. Cdt1N150 appears to be completely stable, with a half-life longer than 240 min. To test if Cdt1N150 is ubiquitylated, we added methylated ubiquitin to untreated replication extract or to Cdt1-depleted extract supplemented with translated Cdt1WT or Cdt1N150. Methylubiquitin-Cdt1 conjugates cannot be detected in crude replication extracts but are enriched in the fraction of Cdt1 that binds to chromatin (7Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). At different times during incubation at room temperature, we isolated the chromatin by centrifugation and determined the amount of ubiquitylated Cdt1 by immunoblotting with anti-Cdt1 antibody (Fig. 3B). Both endogenous Cdt1 and translated wild-type Cdt1 were ubiquitylated, as indicated by a ladder of bands representing differently sized Cdt1-methylubiquitin conjugates. This ladder did not appear when methylubiquitin was left out of the reaction or when the reaction contained Cdt1N150. These results indicate that Cdt1N150 is neither ubiquitylated nor degraded. To determine if expressing a nondegradable Cdt1 mutant would reproduce the Geminin-deficient phenotype, we injected Xenopus embryos with 300 pg of RNA encoding either Cdt1WT or Cdt1N150. As expected, the nondegradable Cdt1N150 accumulated to about 8 times the level of wild-type Cdt1 (Fig. 2D; data not shown). Cdt1N150 induced arrested sectors in 66% of the injections, and the arrest was accompanied by increased amounts of Ser345-phosphorylated Chk1. As previously noted, Cdt1WT induced an arrest in only 3% of injections, and the amount of Ser345-phosphorylated Chk1 was not increased (Fig. 2, B and D). These results indicate that expressing a nondegradable Cdt1 mutant also reproduces the phenotype of Geminin depletion. When the amount of Cdt1WT RNA was increased to 1000 pg, 59% of the injected embryos showed a cell cycle arrest (Fig. 2C). Quantitative Western blotting indicated that injecting this amount of RNA increases the Cdt1 concentration to about 20 times the normal level (not shown). This indicates that vast overexpression of Cdt1 is sufficient to overwhelm all inhibitory mechanisms. Cdt1 Mutants Induce a Second Round of Replication in Xenopus Egg Extracts—To see if the phenotype induced by expressing Cdt1NGB or Cdt1N150 is due to overreplication of the DNA, we tested if these mutants would cause a second round of DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts. Wild-type or mutant Cdt1 was translated in vitro and added back to Cdt1-depleted replication extracts containing [α-32P]dATP and the density label BrdUTP. After replication was complete, the radioactive product DNA was fragmented with EcoRI, and its density was determined by equilibrium centrifugation on a cesium chloride gradient. If each origin fires only once, the product DNA will be substituted with bromodeoxyuridine on only one strand and will have a heavy-light density. If, however, some origins fire more than once, then some of the product DNA will be substituted with bromodeoxyuridine on both strands and will have a heavy-heavy density. We found in these experiments that the extent of rereplication varied from extract to extract, probably reflecting differences in the quality of the eggs from which they were prepared. To compare two mutants, we tested both in the same extract and repeated the experiment multiple times using different extracts (Tables 1 and 2).TABLE 1Average extent of rereplication in different extractsReplication conditionsPercentage of heavy-heavy DNAnp valueaCompared with untreated extract.

This indicates that in vitro-translated Cdt1WT is regulated normally. When Cdt1NGB was added back, however, a significant amount of heavy-heavy DNA was produced. In direct pairwise comparisons, this amount was significantly greater than the amount produced in untreated extracts (11.9 versus 0.4%, p =<0.001) or extracts containing translated Cdt1WT (10.2 versus 1.2%, p = 0.004). This indicates that Geminin suppresses rereplication by inhibiting Cdt1. To confirm this result, we depleted both Geminin and Cdt1 from extract and added back translated Cdt1WT. This gave the same amount of rereplication as adding back Cdt1NGB (14.3 versus 11.5%, p = 0.24). We also measured the amount of rereplication in extracts that had been depleted of Geminin, without depleting or adding back Cdt1. We found an average of 4.5% heavy-heavy DNA in 22 independent measurements (Fig. 5B). In direct comparisons, this amount is significantly higher than the amount in untreated extracts (4.4 versus 0.3%, p = 0.01) (Table 1). In contrast, depleting Geminin from metaphase-arrested extracts does not induce rereplication above background (0.7% versus 1.1%, p = 0.785), as we previously reported (6McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). This difference seems to be due to the amount of Cdt1 protein remaining in S phase or metaphase extracts after Geminin depletion. Depletion of Geminin from S phase extracts does not affect the Cdt1 concentration appreciably, but depletion of Geminin from metaphase extracts removes almost all of the Cdt1 (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 2 and 4). This suggests that Geminin is not required to prevent rereplication when the Cdt1 concentration is very low. It also indicates that the amount of Cdt1 in extracts is in excess of the amount required for DNA replication. Geminin-depleted S phase extracts exhibit significantly less rereplication than Cdt1NGB-containing extracts (5.1 versus 12.3%, p = 0.01) (Table 2). We attribute this difference to the greater concentration of in vitro-translated Cdt1NGB protein compared with endogenous protein (about 2-fold; data not shown). When Cdt1N150 is added back to Cdt1-depleted replication extract containing BrdUTP, it supports normal amounts of replication and does not result in the production of heavy-heavy DNA above background (Fig. 6). In direct comparisons, the amount of rereplication with Cdt1N150 was not significantly different from untreated extracts (1.3% versus 0.4%, p = 0.13) or extracts containing in vitro-translated wild-type Cdt1 (0.8% versus 0.5%, p = 0.064). These results indicate that preventing Cdt1 degradation is not sufficient to cause rereplication within a single S phase. Although expressing nondegradable Cdt1 in extracts had no effect by itself, it did enhance the amount of rereplication in geminin-depleted extracts. When Cdt1N150 was added back to extract depleted of both Geminin and Cdt1, the amount of rereplication was significantly greater than the amount in Geminin-depleted extracts (7.1 versus 2.6%, p = 0.03) or in extracts containing Cdt1N150 but not depleted of Geminin (7.1 versus 1.2%, p = 0.003) (Fig. 6). These results are consistent with the model that Cdt1 is inhibited both by degradation and by Geminin binding. It also indicates that proteasome inhibitors induce rereplication by stabilizing Cdt1 and not some other protein. In this paper, we report that expressing a mutant of Cdt1 that is not regulated by Geminin exactly reproduces the Geminin-deficient phenotype. This finding indicates that, at least in Xenopus, the phenotype of Geminin depletion is the consequence of excessive Cdt1 activity. We could also reproduce the Geminin-deficient phenotype in embryos by expressing a non-degradable mutant of Cdt1 or by expressing wild-type Cdt1 at 20–30 times the endogenous level. Overexpressing Cdt1 in embryos probably overwhelms the Geminin-dependent regulatory mechanism by titrating all of the available Geminin. Cdt1 is an essential replication factor in organisms as diverse as fission yeast and vertebrates, and the protein has no other known biological function. This strongly implies that the Geminin-deficient phenotype is due to an undetectable amount of overreplicated DNA. In support of this hypothesis, we found that expressing a non-Geminin-binding Cdt1 mutant in replication extracts induced sperm DNA templates to undergo a partial second round of DNA replication. We know that this replication occurs within a single S phase, because the cycloheximide in the extract inhibits cyclin synthesis and prevents the extract from entering mitosis. We also observed a smaller but still significant amount of rereplication in extracts that are simply depleted of Geminin. It has previously been reported, both by ourselves and by others, that depleting Geminin from Xenopus egg extracts does not cause rereplication (6McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 7Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We can offer two explanations for the discrepancy between the previous results and those reported here. First, the amount of rereplication in Geminin-depleted extracts is very small, only a few percent. Because of extract-to-extract variability, in many experiments there is no measurable rereplication above background, and statistical analysis is required to show a significant difference. Second, in our previous experiments, we depleted Geminin from metaphase-arrested extracts instead of S phase extracts. Depletion of Geminin from metaphase-arrested extracts removes most of the Cdt1 as well, whereas depleting Geminin from S phase extracts does not affect the Cdt1 level. We hypothesize that when the Cdt1 concentration is very low, Geminin-independent mechanisms (including Cdt1 degradation) are sufficient to prevent rereplication by themselves. The cause of the increased association between Geminin and Cdt1 in metaphase extract is unknown (33Hodgson B. Li A. Tada S. Blow J.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 678-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We could also reproduce the Geminin-deficient phenotype in embryos by expressing a nondegradable mutant of Cdt1. Expressing this mutant in replication extracts causes no significant rereplication by itself but strongly enhances the amount of rereplication seen when Geminin is absent. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that after the first round of DNA synthesis begins, Cdt1 activity is reduced both by Geminin binding and by degradation. Our results agree with previous reports that the nonspecific proteasome inhibitor MG132 has no effect in untreated extracts but induces a second round of initiation in Geminin-depleted extracts (7Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 8Li A. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Maiorano D. Krasinska L. Lutzmann M. Mechali M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 146-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we extend these results by showing that Cdt1 itself is the critical stabilized protein. The model that Cdt1 is inhibited both by Geminin binding and by degradation explains why expressing Cdt1NGB causes more rereplication than depleting Geminin. We added about twice as much Cdt1NGB as is present endogenously, which has the same effect as inhibiting Cdt1 degradation. Cdt1NGB is ubiquitylated and degraded as efficiently as Cdt1WT (Fig. 3), indicating that Cdt1 degradation and Geminin binding are independent events, as shown previously (7Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To explain why Geminin-depleted Xenopus embryos accumulate little or no excess DNA during the first 12 embryonic cell cycles, we hypothesize that the mechanisms that regulate Cdt1 prevent rereplication during G2 phase but that a Cdt1-independent mechanism prevents rereplication during S phase. During the first 12 cell cycles, S and M phase alternate in rapid succession, and there is no G2 phase. We speculate that under these conditions, rereplication is adequately suppressed by a Cdt1-independent mechanism. Significantly, Geminin-depleted embryos arrest just after the 13th cell cycle, the point in development when G2 phase first appears (34Iwao Y. Uchida Y. Ueno S. Yoshizaki N. Masui Y. Dev. Growth Differ. 2005; 47: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The theory that Cdt1 regulation operates mostly during G2 phase has some direct experimental support. It has been reported that postreplicative (G2-like) nuclei will replicate a second time when transferred to Geminin-depleted extract but not when transferred to control extract (8Li A. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Similarly, we observe significant rereplication when postreplicative nuclei are transferred to fresh extract containing Cdt1NGB but not when transferred to extract containing Cdt1WT (data not shown). These observations indicate that the Geminin is required to inhibit reinitiation after the first round of replication is complete. Moreover, adding excess recombinant Cdt1 to an extract containing postreplicative (G2-like) nuclei induces a second round of DNA synthesis, whereas adding the same amount to an extract with unreplicated (G1-like) nuclei does not (7Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This suggests that a Cdt1-independent mechanism prevents reloading of pre-RC during S phase itself. The extent of rereplication observed in our experiments was rather small, amounting to ∼15% of the genome at most. We also observed marked variability in the amount of rereplication from extract to extract. For example, with Cdt1NGB, the amount of heavy-heavy DNA ranged from 5 to 20% of the heavy-light peak. Assuming that the second round of replication starts after the first round is complete, we can attribute this variability to differences in the quality of the extracts made from different batches of eggs. Lower quality extracts might lose activity before extensive rereplication can occur, and all extracts may lose activity before the second round can be completed. We found much less variability when the same measurement was repeated several times using the same extract. We propose the following model to explain the phenotype of Geminin depletion in Xenopus. Geminin prevents a second round of replication during G2 phase by binding and inhibiting Cdt1. During the first 12 embryonic cell cycles, which lack G2 phase, rereplication is suppressed by mechanisms that do not involve Geminin or Cdt1. At the midblastula transition, when G2 phase is introduced, a small amount of rereplication occurs in the absence of Geminin. This second round of initiation introduces replication forks into the DNA that engage the DNA replication checkpoint machinery, activate Chk1 kinase, and arrest the cells in G2 phase. Since Geminin-depleted or Cdt1NGB-expressing embryos arrest very early in development, we were not able to investigate whether abnormal Cdt1 regulation is responsible for the abnormalities in cell differentiation that have been ascribed to Geminin. Such studies would require eliminating Geminin or expressing Cdt1 at later stages of development. We thank Kathryn Shinnick for technical assistance.

However, direct phosphorylation or activation of CD38 by PKG has not been observed in vitro. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism of PKG-mediated activation of CD38. Nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MHCIIA) was identified as a CD38-associated protein upon IL8 stimulation. The IL8-induced association of MHCIIA with CD38 was dependent on PKG-mediated phosphorylation of MHCIIA. Supporting these observations, IL8- or cell-permeable cGMP analog-induced formation of cADP-ribose, increase in [Ca2+]i, and migration of LAK cells were inhibited by treatment with the MHCIIA inhibitor blebbistatin. Binding studies using purified proteins revealed that the association of MHCIIA with CD38 occurred through Lck, a tyrosine kinase. Moreover, these three molecules co-immunoprecipitated upon IL8 stimulation of LAK cells. IL8 treatment of LAK cells resulted in internalization of CD38, which co-localized with MHCIIA and Lck, and blebbistatin blocked internalization of CD38.

However, the molecular mechanism of ADP-ribosyl cyclase/CD38 activation has not been completely elucidated. The active site of CD38 is located in the extracellular domain, whereas the substrate β-NAD+ and the targets of the metabolite cADPR are present inside cell (18De Flora A. Franco L. Guida L. Bruzzone S. Zocchi E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 28: 45-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This topological paradox of CD38 has been addressed and explained by demonstrating 1) the ligand-induced, vesicle-mediated internalization of CD38, which is followed by an increase in the intracellular cADPR concentration ([cADPR]i) (19Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and 2) the β-NAD+-transporting function of connexin-43 and the cADPR-transporting function of membrane-bound CD38 or an unidentified cADPR transporter (20De Flora A. Zocchi E. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1028: 176-191PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the exact molecular mechanism of CD38 activation remains to be clarified. Recently, we reported that CD38 in lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells is activated by a sequential process involving ligation of the interleukin (IL)-8 receptor, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, and activation of protein kinase G (PKG) (16Rah S-Y.

We also found that PKG does not directly activate or phosphorylate CD38 in vitro. In this study, we investigated the missing link between CD38 and PKG for activation of CD38 in LAK cells. In addition, we also examined whether CD38 is internalized during the activation process of CD38. The results indicate that PKG phosphorylates nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MHCIIA) upon stimulation of the IL8 receptor and that the association of phosphorylated MHCIIA with CD38 through Lck induces the internalization and activation of CD38.

After the sample was loaded, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of the same lysis buffer, eluted with a small volume (100 μl) of 3 m glycine buffer (pH 2.7), and immediately neutralized with 10 μl of 1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.6). The eluted MHCIIA was stored at -80 °C until used. Expression and Purification of GST-fused Lck Domains and FLAG-fused CD38—The construction and preparation of GST-fused Lck domains were performed as described previously (23Joung I. Kim T. Stolz L.A. Payne G. Winkler D.G. Walsh C.T. Strominger J.L. Shin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5778-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Cho Y-S. Han M.-K. Choi Y.B. Yun Y. Shin J. Kim U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1685-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lck domains were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21. Cells were grown to A595 = 0.6–0.8, induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and maintained at 25 °C for 5 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences AB). FLAG-fused human CD38 was prepared as described, expressed in COS-7 cells, and purified using anti-FLAG antibody-agarose (24Cho Y-S. Han M.-K. Choi Y.B. Yun Y. Shin J. Kim U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1685-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were stored at -80 °C until used. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed with ice-cold cell lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Supernatants were obtained after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (800 μg) precleared with protein G-agarose were incubated with anti-CD38 mAb or anti-MHCIIA pAb overnight at 4 °C and then further incubated with protein G-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with cell lysis buffer and boiled for 10 min. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 8 or 10% gel. The protein G-precleared lysate (10 μg/lane) was also subjected to immunoblotting to verify equal amounts of the proteins used for immunoprecipitation. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the blots were incubated in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature and then with primary antibodies (CD38, 1:500 dilution; MHCIIA, 1:2000 dilution; actin, 1:5000 dilution; and Lck, 1:2000 dilution) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The blots were rinsed four times with blocking buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution), anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution), or anti-goat IgG (1:5000 dilution) in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. The immunoreactive proteins with the respective secondary antibodies were determined using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences AB) and exposed to an LAS-1000 ImageReader Lite (Fujifilm, Japan). Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and known concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were used as the standard. Measurement of [cADPR]i—The [cADPR]i was measured using a cyclic enzyme assay as described previously (25Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with 0.5 ml of 0.6 m perchloric acid under sonication. Precipitates were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Perchloric acid was removed by mixing the aqueous sample with a solution containing 3 volumes of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane to 1 volume of tri-n-octylamine. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 × g, the aqueous layer was collected and neutralized with 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0). To remove all contaminating nucleotides, the samples were incubated with the following hydrolytic enzymes over-night at 37 °C: 0.44 unit/ml nucleotide pyrophosphatase, 12.5 units/ml alkaline phosphatase, 0.0625 unit/ml NAD glycohydrolase, and 2.5 mm MgCl2 in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Enzymes were removed by filtration using a Centricon-3 filter (Amicon). To convert cADPR to β-NAD+, the samples (0.1 ml/tube) were incubated with 50 μl of cycling reagent containing 0.3 μg/ml Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase, 30 mm nicotinamide, and 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 30 min. The Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase was purified as described (26Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The samples were further incubated with the cycling reagent (0.1 ml) containing 2% ethanol, 100 μg/ml alcohol dehydrogenase, 20 μm resazurin, 10 μg/ml diaphorase, 10 μm riboflavin 5′-phosphate, 10 mm nicotinamide, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 2 h. An increase in the resorufin fluorescence was measured at an excitation of 544 nm and an emission of 590 nm using a SpectraMax Gemini fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp.). Various known concentrations of cADPR were also included in the cycling reaction to generate a standard curve. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Cells were washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (2 mm CaCl2, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm d-glucose, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3)) containing 1% BSA and incubated in the same solution containing 1% BSA for 6 h. Starved LAK cells were incubated with 5 μm fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Hanks’ balanced salt solution containing 1% BSA at 37 °C for 40 min. The cells were washed three times with Hanks’ balanced salt solution. Changes in [Ca2+]i in LAK cells were determined at an excitation of 488 nm and an emission of 530 nm using an air-cooled argon laser system (27Xie G.H. Rah S-Y. Yi K.S. Han M.-K. Chae S.W. Im M.-J. Kim U.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Rink T.J. Nature. 1982; 295: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The emitted fluorescence at 530 nm was collected using a photomultiplier. One image was scanned every 6 s for 10 min using a Nikon confocal microscope. For the calculation of [Ca2+]i, the method of Tsien et al. d>(F d> is 450 nm for fluo-3 and F is the observed fluorescence level. Each tracing was calibrated for the maximal intensity (Fmax) by the addition of ionomycin (8 μm) and for the minimal intensity (Fmin) by the addition of EGTA (50 mm) at the end of each measurement. In Vivo Phosphorylation—LAK cells were washed with phosphate-free medium and then incubated in phosphate-free medium containing 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate at 37 °C for 6 h. The cells were incubated with various agents, washed twice with 10 mm PBS (pH 7.4), and then lysed with ice-cold cell lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were collected for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-CD38 mAb as described above. Determination of Cell Migration—Cell migration was determined as described previously (22Sebok K. Woodside D. al-Aoukaty A. Ho A.D. Gluck S. Maghazachi A.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1524-1534PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed with RPMI 1640 medium, scrapped using a policeman, and washed with RPMI 1640 medium. Transwells with 8-μm pore size polycarbonate filters were used. Lower chambers contained 500 μl of RPMI 1640 medium and 1% BSA. LAK cells (4 × 105) in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing various agents were placed in the upper chamber and then incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 h. After removal of the unattached cells, the filters were removed, fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol, and stained with 15% Wright-Giemsa stain for 7 min. The cells were counted under a phase-contrast microscope. Confocal Microscopy of Internalized and Co-localized CD38, MHCIIA, and Lck—For localization of CD38 and the cognate proteins, immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (29Han M-K. Kim S.-J. Park Y.-R. Shin Y.-M. Park H.-J. Park K.-J. Park K.-H. Kim H.-K. Jang S.-I. An N.-H. Kim U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5315-5321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, LAK cells were incubated with IL8. At the indicated time points, the suspension cells (100 μl) were transferred into 3.7% paraformaldehyde/PBS (900 μl) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and then washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min and sequentially incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD38 mAb (1:100) and Alexa 633-conjugated anti-Lck (1:1000) and TRITC-conjugated anti-MHCIIA (1:1000) pAbs in the presence of 0.1% BSA at 4 °C for 8 h for each antibody. After being washed three times with PBS, cells were attached to slides precoated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine and visualized with a Zeiss confocal microscope. Statistical Analysis—Data represent the means ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test. A p value <0.05 was considered significant. Treatment of LAK Cells with IL8 Induces Association of MHCIIA with CD38—Stimulation of the IL8 receptor induces CD38 activation via cGMP/PKG in LAK cells, but CD38 is neither directly phosphorylated nor activated by PKG in vitro (16Rah S-Y. Park K.-H. Han M.-K. Im M.-J. Kim U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2888-2895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To identify the protein(s) located between CD38 and PKG, LAK cells metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate were treated with IL8 in the absence or presence of a PKG inhibitor, (Rp)-8-pCPT-cGMP-S, and the cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-CD38 mAb. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment with IL8 significantly increased the phosphorylation level of an ∼200-kDa protein compared with the control. The intensity of the phosphoprotein was decreased in the presence of the PKG inhibitor, suggesting that the IL8-induced phosphorylation of the protein is mediated by PKG. The protein band was excised from the gel and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis. The results revealed that the protein was MHCIIA (Fig. 1B). To further confirm this observation, immunoprecipitation of MHCIIA by anti-CD38 antibody was examined with and without IL8, the PKG inhibitor, or the cell-permeable cGMP analog 8-pCPT-cGMP. The level of MHCIIA in the immunocomplex was increased upon treatment with IL8 compared with the control (Fig. 1C). The IL8-mediated association of MHCIIA with CD38 was substantially reduced in the presence of the PKG inhibitor. Treatment of LAK cells with the cGMP analog also increased the co-immunoprecipitation of MHCIIA compared with the control. Moreover, pretreatment of LAK cells with the specific MHCIIA inhibitor blebbistatin completely inhibited the IL8-induced co-immunoprecipitation of MHCIIA and CD38 (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that PKG phosphorylates MHCIIA in LAK cells upon IL8 stimulation and that phosphorylated MHCIIA is associated with CD38. MHCIIA Is Involved in CD38 Activation—Activation of CD38 by treatment of LAK cells with IL8 results in an increase in [cADPR]i, production of a sustained Ca2+ signal, and an increase in cell migration (16Rah S-Y. Park K.-H. Han M.-K. Im M.-J. Kim U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2888-2895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of MHCIIA in signaling involving CD38, we examined the effects of blebbistatin on these IL8/CD38-induced cellular responses. The increase in [cADPR]i upon treatment with IL8 or the cGMP analog was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of LAK cells with blebbistatin (Fig. 2A). Consistent with these observations, the IL8- or cGMP analog-mediated sustained increase in [Ca2+]i and cell migration was also blocked by blebbistatin pretreatment (Fig. 2, B and C). These data indicate that MHCIIA is involved in IL8-induced CD38 activation. MHCIIA Is Phosphorylated by PKG in IL8-induced LAK Cells— Next, we examined whether MHCIIA is directly phosphorylated by PKG. Indeed, purified MHCIIA was shown to be a good substrate for PKG by in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). To determine which amino acid residues of MHCIIA are phosphorylated upon IL8 stimulation, LAK cells were treated with IL8 in the absence and presence of the PKG inhibitor or cGMP analog. Cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-MHCIIA pAb, and phosphorylated amino acids in MHCIIA were probed with anti-phosphoamino acid antibodies. Treatment with IL8 specifically increased the phosphorylation of the serine residue in MHCIIA, but not the threonine and tyrosine residues (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the IL8-mediated phosphorylation of the serine residue was substantially reduced in the presence of the PKG inhibitor. The cGMP analog increased the phosphorylation of the serine residue compared with the control. PKG-phosphorylated MHCIIA Is Associated with CD38 via the Lck SH3 Domain—To examine whether phospho-MHCIIA interacts directly with CD38, a binding study of phospho-MHCIIA and CD38 was performed in vitro. However, the interaction of CD38 with MHCIIA was not changed before or after the phosphorylation of MHCIIA by PKG (Fig. 4A). We demonstrated previously that the tyrosine kinase Lck directly interacts with CD38 via its SH2 domain (24Cho Y-S. Han M.-K. Choi Y.B. Yun Y. Shin J. Kim U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1685-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The possibility that Lck is required for the interaction of CD38 with phospho-MHCIIA was examined. In the presence of Lck only, the interaction of CD38 with phospho-MHCIIA was significantly increased compared with that observed with non-phosphorylated MHCIIA (Fig. 4A). To further confirm that Lck may lead to the association of phospho-MHCIIA with CD38, various constructs of Lck domains were expressed, purified, and reconstituted with phospho-MHCIIA and FLAG-CD38. Binding of phospho-MHCIIA to CD38 was observed only in the presence of Lck constructs containing both the SH2 and SH3 domains (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that phospho-MHCIIA binds to the SH3 domain of Lck, the SH2 domain of which binds to CD38 (Fig. 4C, fourth lane). To confirm the findings, we examined whether stimulation of LAK cells with IL8 or the cGMP analog increases the association of these three molecules. Consistent with the above observations, the levels of MHCIIA were significantly increased in the immunoprecipitates of anti-CD38 mAb upon treatment of LAK cells with IL8 or the cGMP analog (Fig. 4D). Lck also co-immunoprecipitated with CD38 without changing the level under the various conditions applied. These results suggest that Lck is constitutively associated with CD38 and that phospho-MHCIIA is recruited to the CD38-Lck complex upon IL8 or cGMP stimulation. MHCIIA Is Involved in CD38 Internalization—Because the above data indicate that complex formation of CD38 with MHCIIA and Lck activates CD38 and because MHCII is involved in protein trafficking in the process of vesicle budding (30Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 31Musch A. Cohen D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), localization of these three molecules in LAK cells was examined in the presence of IL8 with and without pretreatment with the MHCIIA inhibitor blebbistatin. A confocal microscope examination revealed that CD38 was internalized as early as 15 s after IL8 treatment and that MHCIIA and Lck co-localized with CD38 at this time point (Fig. 5A). After 60 s, CD38 returned to the initial position. In contrast, pretreatment of LAK cells with blebbistatin resulted in inhibition of CD38 internalization, and the location of MHCIIA and Lck was also unchanged (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5 (C and D) shows the percentage of cells showing CD38 internalization upon treatment with IL8 or with IL8 plus blebbistatin. These results suggest that MHCIIA and Lck are involved in the internalization and activation of CD38 induced by IL8. We demonstrated previously that CD38 in LAK cells is activated through sequential signaling involving the IL8 receptor, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated increase in Ca2+, and activation of PKG (16Rah S-Y. Park K.-H. Han M.-K. Im M.-J. Kim U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2888-2895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, we have extended the molecular mechanism of the activation of CD38 in LAK cells. Our results reveal for the first time that MHCIIA is associated with CD38 through Lck and is involved in the internalization and activation of CD38. In addition, the results indicate that PKG phosphorylates the serine residue in MHCIIA upon stimulation of the IL8 receptor and that the phosphorylation of MHCIIA leads to binding to the CD38-Lck complex via the SH3 domain of Lck. Previous studies demonstrated that CD38 internalization induced by external stimuli such as β-NAD+ and thiol compounds results in an increase in [cADPR]i (19Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Han M-K. Kim S.-J. Park Y.-R. Shin Y.-M. Park H.-J. Park K.-J. Park K.-H. Kim H.-K. Jang S.-I. An N.-H. Kim U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5315-5321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our results reveal that stimulation of the IL8 receptor (a G-protein-coupled receptor) in LAK cells induces CD38 internalization and increases [cADPR]i. These findings suggest that CD38 internalization leads to CD38 activation. Our previous data showing that the level of cADPR increases at ∼30 s after IL8 treatment and reaches a maximal level at ∼90 s (24Cho Y-S. Han M.-K. Choi Y.B. Yun Y. Shin J. Kim U.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1685-1690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) correlate well with the data of CD38 internalization, which occurred as early as 15 s and persisted for up to 30 s (Fig. 5A). However, NAD+- or glutathione-induced internalization of CD38 and increase in [Ca2+]i occur relatively slowly and reach maximal levels at ∼1 h (19Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In our study, the CD38 internalization process was mediated by IL8 receptor signaling. Moreover, the intracellular calcium level was increased immediately after IL8 treatment and was sustained. Therefore, we suggest that the discrepancy is due to the different signaling mechanism of CD38 internalization/activation: IL8 receptor signaling-mediated internalization of CD38 versus direct activation of CD38 with the substrate NAD+. In addition, although it is unclear whether the internalization of CD38 is sufficient to target the substrate β-NAD+, it appears, however, that the internalization of CD38 is the critical step for its activation because pretreatment of LAK cells with blebbistatin not only blocked IL8-induced internalization of CD38, but also inhibited IL8-stimulated cADPR production, sustained Ca2+ increase, and migration of LAK cells. Evidence for involvement of MHCIIA in the internalization of CD38 is that co-localization of CD38 with MHCIIA was found in LAK cells upon activation of the IL8 receptor, and the MHCIIA-specific inhibitor blebbistatin blocked the internalization of CD38. Moreover, our results indicate that the phosphorylation of MHCIIA by PKG is critical for the interaction with Lck: non-phosphorylated MHCIIA did not bind to the CD38-Lck complex, and the PKG inhibitor blocked the IL8-induced phosphorylation of the seine residue in MHCIIA. In eukaryotic cells, there are at least two nonmuscle MHCII genes that encode separate isoforms of the heavy chain, MHCIIA and MHCIIB (32Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). T cells express MHCIIA only (33Maupin P. Phillips C.L. Adelstein R.S. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3077-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are involved in diverse processes, including cytokinesis, cell motility, and protein trafficking in the process of vesicle budding (34Jacobelli J. Chmura S.A. Buxton D.B. Davis M.M. Krummel M.F. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). MHCIIs have been shown to play a role in protein sorting at the plasma membrane level (31Musch A. Cohen D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and in the production of vesicles and association with membrane vesicles (35Linz-McGillem L. Alliegro M.C. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 543-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, an association of MHCIIA with the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in T cell lysates has been reported (36Neel N.F. Schutyser E. Sai J. Fan G.H. Richmond A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 6: 637-658Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Muñoz et al. (37Muñoz P. Navarro M.D. Pavón E.J. Salmerón J. Malavasi F. Sancho J. Zubiaur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50791-50802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) reported that CD38 signaling in T cells is initiated within a subset of membrane rafts containing Lck and the CD3ζ subunit of the T cell receptor. Clustering of T cell plasma membrane proteins into lipid raft microdomains has been suggested to play an important role in signal transduction (38Wulfing C. Davis M.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2266-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Lck is one of eight members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, which are activated by T cell stimulation and required for T cell proliferation, IL2 production, and cytotoxicity of LAK cells (39Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Lck consists of four domains, viz. the N-terminal, SH2, SH3, and catalytic domains. Our study on the complex formation of CD38 with Lck and MHCIIA has revealed that Lck acts as a linker between CD38 and MHCIIA. Moreover, SH3 domain-containing fusion proteins of Lck are able to interact with purified phosphorylated MHCIIA, but the SH2 domain does not. Several studies have demonstrated that SH3 domainligand interaction is critical for activation of members of the Src kinase family, including Lck (40Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 41Gorska M.M. Stafford S.J. Cen O. Sur S. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that Lck kinase activity is not involved in CD38 activation and/or internalization because no phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD38 or MHCIIA upon IL8 stimulation was observed. It appears that Lck is tightly associated with CD38 in LAK cells, forming a complex, because Lck was immunoprecipitated by anti-CD38 mAb without stimulation of the IL8 receptor and because the level of Lck in the immunoprecipitates was not changed by the receptor stimulation. Because these findings are unexpected, further detailed studies are required. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that recruitment of phospho-MHCIIA in the CD38-Lck complex is the critical step for the internalization and activation of CD38 and that IL8-activated PKG phosphorylates MHCIIA directly. In addition, the results suggest that Lck acts as an adaptor for the association of CD38 with MHCIIA in IL8/CD38 signaling in LAK cells. We are very grateful to the volunteers for providing blood.

https://openalex.org/W2071165238,"Ras GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) are negative regulators of Ras that convert active Ras-GTP to inactive Ras-GDP. R-Ras GAP is a membrane-associated molecule with stronger GAP activity for R-Ras, an activator of integrin, than H-Ras. We found that R-Ras GAP is down-regulated during neurite formation in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells by nerve growth factor (NGF), which is blocked by the transient expression of R-Ras gap or dominant negative R-ras cDNA. By establishing a PC12 subclone that stably expresses exogenous R-Ras GAP, it was found that NGF reduced endogenous R-Ras GAP but not exogenous R-Ras GAP, suggesting that down-regulation of R-Ras GAP occurs at the transcription level. To clarify the physiological role of R-Ras GAP, we generated mice that express mutant Ras GAP with knocked down activity. While heterozygotes are normal, homozygous mice die at E12.5-13.5 of massive subcutaneous and intraparenchymal bleeding, probably due to underdeveloped adherens junctions between capillary endothelial cells. These results show essential roles of R-Ras GAP in development and differentiation: its expression is needed for embryonic development of blood vessel barriers, whereas its down-regulation facilitates NGF-induced neurite formation of PC12 cells via maintaining activated R-Ras."
https://openalex.org/W2074010346,"Death-associated protein-related apoptotic kinase-2 (DRAK2), a member of the death-associated protein-like family of serine/threonine kinases, is highly expressed in lymphoid organs and is a negative regulator of T cell activation. To investigate the regulation of DRAK2 activity in primary lymphocytes, we employed mass spectrometry to identify sites of autophosphorylation on DRAK2. These studies have revealed a key site of autophosphorylation on serine 12. Using a phospho-specific antibody to detect Ser12 phosphorylation, we found that autophosphorylation is induced by antigen receptor stimulation in T and B cells. In Jurkat T cells, resting B cells and thymocytes, DRAK2 was hypophosphorylated on Ser12 but rapidly phosphorylated with antigen receptor ligation. This increase in phosphorylation was dependent on intracellular calcium mobilization, because BAPTA-AM blocked DRAK2 kinase activity, whereas the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin promoted Ser12 phosphorylation. Our results show that DRAK2 kinase activity is regulated in a calcium-dependent manner and that Ser12 phosphorylation is necessary for optimal suppression of T cell activation by this kinase, suggesting a potential feedback loop may act to modulate the activity of this kinase following antigen receptor signaling.

This increase in phosphorylation was dependent on intracellular calcium mobilization, because BAPTA-AM blocked DRAK2 kinase activity, whereas the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin promoted Ser12 phosphorylation. Our results show that DRAK2 kinase activity is regulated in a calcium-dependent manner and that Ser12 phosphorylation is necessary for optimal suppression of T cell activation by this kinase, suggesting a potential feedback loop may act to modulate the activity of this kinase following antigen receptor signaling.

The DAP family of pro-apoptotic serine/threonine kinases consists of five members; all are capable of inducing apoptosis upon overexpression in cell culture (1.Kogel D. Prehn J.H. Scheidtmann K.H. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Indeed, the prototype DAP kinase (DAPK1) was identified in a screen for positive mediators of apoptosis. Sequence homology between the five family members is restricted to the N-terminal kinase domain, whereas the C-terminal regions are unique and are required for the regulatory functions of each kinase, linking individual family members to specific signal transduction pathways. The fifth member, DRAK2, is expressed primarily in hematopoietic tissues. DRAK2-deficient mice have no defects in apoptosis, and we have shown that retroviral expression of DRAK2 in NIH3T3 cells does not induce overt apoptosis. Rather, recent data have demonstrated an important role for DRAK2 in negative regulation of T cell activation (2.McGargill M.A. Wen B.G. Walsh C.M. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 2004; 21: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3.Friedrich M.L. Wen B.G. Bain G. Kee B.L. Katayama C. Murre C. Hedrick S.M. Walsh C.M. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In response to suboptimal T cell antigen receptor (TCR) stimulation, T cells from mice deficient in DRAK2 hyperproliferate, produce higher levels of cytokines, and mobilize greater levels of calcium when compared with wild-type T cells. DRAK2 is developmentally regulated, with low levels of expression in immature thymocytes and high levels in mature thymocytes, and analysis of DRAK2 knock-out mice has shown that this kinase negatively regulates the T cell activation threshold in developing thymocytes (3.Friedrich M.L. Wen B.G. Bain G. Kee B.L. Katayama C. Murre C. Hedrick S.M. Walsh C.M. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although double positive (immature) thymocytes from Drak2-/- mice mobilize calcium in a manner similar to thymocytes from wild-type mice, mature, single positive thymocytes from Drak2-/- mice have enhanced calcium responses to suboptimal TCR stimulation. Drak2-/- mice have also been reported to possess B cells with a similarly diminished activation threshold (2.McGargill M.A. Wen B.G. Walsh C.M. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 2004; 21: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent data have also shown that Drak2-/- mice have defective germinal center formation, demonstrating a critical role for DRAK2 in adaptive humoral immunity. 5A. Al-Qahtani and P. Casali, personal communication. Like other members of the DAP kinase family, DRAK2 is capable of both auto- and trans-phosphorylation (4.Sanjo H. Kawai T. Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29066-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Kinase activity is abolished in a C-terminal truncation mutant and when the critical lysine of the ATP-binding site is mutated (4.Sanjo H. Kawai T. Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29066-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The first two members of the DAP kinase family, DAPK1 and DRP-1 kinase, both have autophosphorylation sites at Ser308 (Refs. 5.Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O. Bialik S. Shani G. Berrisi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar and 6.Shani G. Henis-Korenblit S. Jona G. Gileadi O. Eisenstein M. Ziv T. Admon A. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1099-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, respectively). These autophosphorylation sites exist within their calmodulin regulatory domains, a domain absent from DRAK2. Additionally, six autophosphorylation sites have been defined in ZIP kinase (7.Graves P.R. Winkfield K.M. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9363-9374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the third member of the DAP kinase family. In many cases, these sites of autophosphorylation have been shown to play key roles in modulating the function of these DAP kinases (8.Bialik S. Kimchi A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Engagement of the TCR or B cell antigen receptor results in rapid recruitment of various signaling molecules to the receptor complex to transmit signals generated at the cell surface. Importantly, a cascade of early intracellular activation events results in calcium mobilization (9.Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). When inositol trisphosphate is generated subsequent to TCR and B cell antigen receptor stimulation, it binds to receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum and opens Ca2+ channels that release Ca2+ into the cytosol (9.Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Once intracellular stores have been depleted, calcium channels in the plasma membrane (calcium release-activated calcium channel) open, resulting in sustained calcium influx into the cell, facilitating store refilling. Recently, this process has been shown to involve the participation of the endoplasmic reticulum protein Stim1 and the plasma membrane protein Orai1 during T cell activation (10.Zhang S.L. Yu Y.

Because calcium mobilization plays a central role in controlling lymphocyte function, and because DRAK2 modulates thresholds for calcium mobilization in peripheral T cells and post-selection thymocytes, we sought to examine the physiological relevance and the mechanism that regulates DRAK2 function. In an effort to understand the regulation of DRAK2 kinase activity during lymphocyte activation, we have employed mass spectrometry to identify sites of autophosphorylation within the sequence of this kinase. Thus far, two sites have been identified, and one has been analyzed in primary lymphocytes using a phospho-specific Ab. In the present study, we show that DRAK2 autocatalytic activity is induced rapidly following antigen receptor signaling, and that its phosphorylation status is regulated by intracellular calcium mobilization. We further demonstrate that mutation of one of these sites to prevent autophosphorylation diminishes the biological activity of DRAK2 in primary T cells. Plasmid Constructs−pGEX-2TK-DRAK2 (GST-DRAK2) was cloned using the pGEX-2TK vector backbone from Amersham Biosciences. Site-specific mutation at serine 12 to alanine was made using the oligonucleotide (5′-GCCGAACTGTCGCGGGCTTGCTAACT-3′) and to aspartic acid using the oligonucleotide (5′-GCCGAAGTGTCGATGGCTTGCTAAC-3′). The Ser to Ala mutation at AA348 was made using the oligonucleotide (5′-CCCTGAAGATGGCGCCTTAGTTTCTAAA-3′). pEGFP-N1 vector was obtained from Clontech. MSCV-IRES-Thy1.1-DRAK2 was cloned as described (3.Friedrich M.L. Wen B.G. Bain G. Kee B.L. Katayama C. Murre C. Hedrick S.M. Walsh C.M. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Recombinant Protein Purification−GST-tagged recombinant protein was purified from bacterial lysate using GSH-agarose beads (Sigma). Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced BL21 cells were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Tween, 1% Triton X-100. The lysate was subsequently spun for 30 min at 11,000 rpm and subjected to overnight binding with GSH-agarose beads. The beads were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Recombinant GST-DRAK2 was eluted by incubating the beads for 20 min in 10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) diluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. In Vitro Kinase Assays−Eluted GST-DRAK2 was incubated at 30 °C with kinase reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2), 20 μm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). Some reactions included 5 μg of rabbit myosin light chain (Sigma) as a transphosphorylation substrate. Kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. After boiling, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. For analysis of DRAK2 kinase activity in mammalian cells, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with EGFP-tagged DRAK2 (wt or mutants) by the calcium phosphate method. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in high salt buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm Hepes, 1% Triton X-100) containing 300 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm sodium vanadate. EGFP-DRAK2 was isolated from precleared whole cell extracts using anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (BD Bioscience) for immunoprecipitation in IP buffer 3 (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) in the presence of Protein G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Following extensive washing, immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assays as above, in some cases with non-radioactive ATP added for subsequent mass spectrometric characterization. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry−Proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The selected bands were cut, reduced, alkylated, and digested by trypsin (Promega Corp, Madison, WI), and the resulting tryptic digests were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis as described (14.Guerrero C. Tagwerker C. Kaiser P. Huang L. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 366-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Briefly, the experiments were carried out by nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC, Ultimate LC Packings, Dionex) coupled on-line to a quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (QSTAR XL, Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex). The QSTAR MS was operated in an information-dependent mode in which each full MS scan was followed by three MS/MS scans where the three most abundant peptide molecular ions were dynamically selected for collision-induced dissociation that generates tandem mass spectra. Data Base Searching−The acquired MS/MS spectra were subsequently submitted for data base searching and protein identification using the development version of Protein Prospector (14.Guerrero C. Tagwerker C. Kaiser P. Huang L. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2006; 5: 366-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The mass accuracy for parent ions and fragment ions were set as ±100 ppm and 300 ppm, respectively. The cysteine was set as modified by iodoacetamide and phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine was chosen as default modification during Batchtag searching. The Search Compare program within the developmental version of Protein Prospector (15.Chalkley R.J. Baker P.R. Huang L. Hansen K.C. Allen N.P. Rexach M. Burlingame A.L. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1194-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was used to summarize, validate, and compare the results from different experiment samples. The identified phosphorylated peptides were further confirmed by manual inspection of the MS/MS spectra. Protein sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW from the European Bioinformatics Institute (available at www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw). Searches to determine the computed molecular weight and pI ranges of each phosphorylated isoform were conducted using ScanSite (scansite.mit.edu) using an algorithm developed by Hochstrasser and colleagues (16.Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 17.Bjellqvist B. Hughes G.J. Pasquali C. Paquet N. Ravier F. Sanchez J.C. Frutiger S. Hochstrasser D. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Antibody Production−The anti-phospho-Ser12 polyclonal antibodies were produced by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled synthetic peptide corresponding to residues surrounding Ser12 of mouse DRAK2. The antibodies were purified by protein A and peptide affinity chromatography. Western Blotting and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays− Western blotting was performed as described previously (3.Friedrich M.L. Wen B.G. Bain G. Kee B.L. Katayama C. Murre C. Hedrick S.M. Walsh C.M. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Secondary antibody incubation was performed for 1 h at room temperature in TBST plus 5% bovine serum albumin. IL-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were conducted as described previously (18.Arechiga A.F. Bell B.D. Solomon J.C. Chu I.H. Dubois C.L. Hall B.E. George T.C. Coder D.M. Walsh C.M. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7800-7804Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Calf Intestinal Phosphatase Treatment and Peptide Blocking−Splenocytes from C57BL/6J mice were treated with 100 nm Calyculin A (Cell Signaling Technologies) or vehicle only for 30 min. Cells were lysed in 150 mm low salt lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100) followed by incubation with 10–40 units/ml calf intestinal phosphatase (Fisher Scientific) and 1× phosphatase buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. To assess the specificity of the phospho-Ser12 Ab, Western blots were produced using lysates from 293T cells transfected with EGFP-DRAK2 or EGFP only. 1 μg of anti-phospho-Ser12 was incubated with 5, 10, or 30 μg of either non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated Ser12 peptide for 18 h prior to probing Western blots. Western blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-DRAK2 to verify equivalent loading. Mice−Drak2-/- (Stk17btm1Hed) mice have been described previously (2.McGargill M.A. Wen B.G. Walsh C.M. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 2004; 21: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Drak2-/- and C57BL/6J mice were bred and maintained in accordance with the regulation of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Irvine. Mice were used between 8 and 12 weeks of age. Lymphocyte Purification, Stimulation, and Lysis−Jurkat T cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 (clone C305, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for the indicated times followed by lysis and Western blotting. Thymocytes were harvested from 8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice and stimulated with biotinylated anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) plus anti-CD4 (1 μg/ml), followed by cross-linking with streptavidin (1 μg/ml) for the indicated times. Immature and mature B cells were purified from total splenocytes using MACS CD43-conjugated beads to deplete non-B cells (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Typical purity was between 95 and 98%. Stimulation was performed using 20 μg/ml soluble anti-IgM F(ab)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for the times indicated. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Analysis of Calcium Signaling−Purified lymphocytes were stimulated as described above in the presence or absence of 4 mm EGTA (Fisher Scientific), 40 μm BAPTA-AM (Calbiochem), 1 μm thapsigargin (Calbiochem), 1 μm ionomycin, and/or 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma). For experiments with inhibitors or calcium chelators, stimulation was performed following a 20-min pretreatment. Retroviral Transduction and Calcium Mobilization Assays− MiT, MiT-DRAK2, -S12A, and -S12D constructs were transfected into 293T cells, and retroviral supernatants were collected as described (3.Friedrich M.L. Wen B.G. Bain G. Kee B.L. Katayama C. Murre C. Hedrick S.M. Walsh C.M. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Purified T cells from Drak2-/- mice were stimulated for 24 h using plate-bound anti-CD3 (200 ng/ml), soluble anti-CD28 (200 ng/ml), and human recombinant IL-2 (100 units/ml). Plates were spun at 24 and 48 h following primary stimulation using retroviral supernatants in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Specialty Media). Cells were rested in RPMI containing 10 ng/ml each IL-7 and IL-15 (eBioscience). After a 2-day rest, calcium mobilization assays were performed essentially as described (3.Friedrich M.L. Wen B.G. Bain G. Kee B.L. Katayama C. Murre C. Hedrick S.M. Walsh C.M. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1379-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), except that cells were pre-bound with anti-CD3 (0.3 μg/ml) and cross-linked with 40 μg/ml anti-Hamster IgG (Vector Labs). Identification of in Vitro Autophosphorylation Sites−With an interest toward investigating the regulation of DRAK2 kinase activity following antigen receptor stimulation, we sought to determine its sites of autophosphorylation. Our rationale was that such information would aid in the development of reagents to interrogate the phosphorylation status of DRAK2 in primary lymphocytes. Because the known autophosphorylation sites of DAPK1 and DRP-1 are not conserved in the DRAK2 sequence, we employed mass spectrometry to evaluate unique sites of autophosphorylation in DRAK2. We first demonstrated catalytic activity for recombinant DRAK2 by in vitro kinase assays. Recombinant GST-tagged DRAK2 kinase preparations (wild-type, the C-terminal truncation consisting of amino acid residues 1–290, and the kinase-inactive mutant DRAK2-K62A) were purified from BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli using GSH-agarose beads and eluted using reduced glutathione. Catalytic activity was verified using eluted samples subjected to in vitro kinase assays in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 1A). Although the wild-type kinase was highly active, this activity depended upon the presence of the C-terminal regulatory domain (291–372) and the ATP-binding lysine 62 in the ATP-binding loop of the kinase domain. These results concur with previously published data using Myc-tagged protein purified from transiently transfected COS7 cells (4.Sanjo H. Kawai T. Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29066-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19.Matsumoto M. Miyake Y. Nagita M. Inoue H. Shitakubo D. Takemoto K. Ohtsuka C. Murakami H. Nakamura N. Kanazawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine the sites of autophosphorylation using a mass spectrometric approach, GST-tagged wild-type and kinase-inactive DRAK2 were affinity-purified and subjected to in vitro kinase assays using non-radioactive ATP. The protein products were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A), followed by in-gel digestion and subsequent liquid chromatography LC-MS/MS analysis. The identified phosphorylated peptides are summarized in Table 1. Nine phosphorylated peptides were identified in the GST-DRAK2 protein, of which two phosphorylation sites were located in the regions of the GST fusion protein (Ser196) and the linker (Ser226), whereas the other seven sites were present in the DRAK2 protein. An example of the mass spectrometry result is shown in Fig. 1B. A doubly charged ion (MH 2+2 870.39) from the tryptic digest of GST-wild-type DRAK2 was detected and was determined as a phosphorylated form of the peptide (338EDKENIPEDGSLVSK352) based on the fragment ions obtained in the MS/MS spectrum (Fig. 1B). A series of y ions (y1 ∼ y12) was obtained, among which the y5 ∼ y12 ions were identified as phosphorylated (i.e. 80 Da higher than the non-phosphorylated mass), and y1 ∼ y4 ions were observed in a non-phosphorylated state. In addition, a loss of 98 Da (due to the loss of H3PO4) was observed for y5 ∼ y12 ions, the characteristic loss of phosphorylated serine or threonine during collision-induced dissociation analysis. These results clearly demonstrate that the phosphorylation occurred on Ser at position 5 from the C terminus of this peptide, which corresponds to Ser348 in the full-length DRAK2 sequence.TABLE 1Summary of autophosphorylation sites detected in recombinant wild-type and mutant forms of GST-DRAK2 Peptide sequences are shown at the left for peptides derived from GST and murine DRAK2; numbers represent the amino acid residues within the start methionine in each sequence. Columns under wild-type (DRAK2 WT) and mutant forms represent the detection of phosphorylation within the listed peptides for each GST fusion. For each peptide, the phosphorylated serine is designated by “pS” within the sequence listed.Peptides identified by MS/MSDRAK2 WTK62ADeltaCS12AS348APhosphorylation found in GST sequence192YLKSpSK197+––––219SDLVPRGpSRR228+––––Phosphorylation found in DRAK2 sequence10pSVSGLLTTTPQTPIK24+––++10SVpSGLLTTTPQTPIK24+––NAaNA, not applicable for this clone+281RPTAESCLSHSWLQQWDFGSLFHPEETSGpSSQIQDTLR319––NA–+325TSKpSSCNGSCGAR337+–NA––328SSCNGpSCGRR337+–NA––338EDKENIPEDGpSLVSK352+–NA+NA338EDKENIPEDGSLVpSKR353+–NA++354FRFDDSLPpSPHELVPDLFC372+–NA++a NA, not applicable for this clone Open table in a new tab In addition, we have observed two different, singly phosphorylated forms of the same peptide. The non-phosphorylated peptide was detected as MH 2+2 771.92, whereas the two phosphorylated peptides (p-peptides) were observed with the same nominal masses as MH 2+2 811.92. Their MS/MS spectra are illustrated in Fig. 1 (C–E, respectively). As shown in Fig. 1C, a series of y ions (y1, y3, y4, and y6 ∼ y12) and b ions (b2 ∼ b6) were obtained in the MS/MS spectrum of the non-phosphorylated peptide (MH 2+2 771.92), which determined the peptide sequence as 10SVSGLLTTTPQTPIK24. This unambiguously matches the N terminus of the DRAK2 protein. Comparing the three MS/MS spectra in Fig. 1 (C–E), the y ions (y1, y3, y4, and y6 ∼ y11) were the same as the non-phosphorylated form, whereas b ions in these three spectra were different, suggesting that the Thr residues before position 11 from C terminus were not phosphorylated, and phosphorylation most likely occurred close to the N terminus. In Fig. 1D, except for the b2 ion, b3 and b4 ions were 80 Da higher than their corresponding non-phosphorylated b ions shown in Fig. 1C, indicating that these ions were phosphorylated. The detection of a series of bi* ions (i.e. b3* ∼ b7*) due to the neutral loss (-98 Da) of their phosphorylated b ions determined the phosphorylation of Ser at position 3 from N terminus. The unique internal ion (338.14, pSGL) and its neutral loss ion (240.15, pSGL*) further confirmed the identification. In Fig. 1E, all of the observed b ions (b2 ∼ b4) were 80 Da higher than the corresponding b ions in Fig. 1C. The b2 ion in Fig. 1E was 80 Da higher than the b2 in Fig. 1 (C and D), suggesting that phosphorylation occurred before Ser at position 3 from N terminus. In addition, the detection of bi* ions (i.e. b2* ∼ b7*), and the non-phosphorylated internal ion (258.17, SGL) in Fig. 1E established that the Ser at the N terminus, instead of the Ser at position 3 from N terminus, was phosphorylated. Therefore, the phosphorylation of two different Ser (i.e. Ser10 and Ser12 in the full sequence of DRAK2) in the same peptide was identified. As summarized in Table 1, a total of seven phosphorylation sites were found in the full-length sequence of DRAK2: i.e. Ser10, Ser12, Ser328, Ser333, Ser348, Ser351, and Ser362. To confirm these results, LC-MS/MS analysis of a kinase-inactive mutant (K62A) was carried out after an in vitro kinase reaction and in-gel digestion. Data base searches of the MS/MS spectra did not reveal any phosphorylated peptides. To further verify that there was no phosphorylation in the K62A mutant digest after the in vitro assay, we attempted to extract both non-phosphorylated and the corresponding p-peptide ions from the entire LC-MS run and compare the extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) trace of each particular ion in both wild-type and mutant samples. If no phosphorylation occurred in the mutant sample, the non-phosphorylated peptides would be detected, but not the p-peptides. We focused our analysis on Ser10 and Ser12 to discern potential phosphorylation in the mutant sample. The XIC traces of the non-phosphorylated DRAK2 peptide (MH 2+2 771.92, 10SVSGLLTTTPQTPIK24) were first generated from the LC MS runs of both samples to determine its presence (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Due to the presence of another peptide with the same m/z that eluted slightly earlier, there were two peaks present in the XIC traces. Previous MS/MS analysis shown in Fig. 1 identified that the peptide with m/z at 771.92 eluted at 46.5 min was the non-phosphorylated peptide, which is present in both samples. To determine whether Ser10 or Ser12 were phosphorylated in the mutant, we then compared the XIC traces of the p-peptides (MH 2+2 811.92) from both samples (supplemental Fig. S1, C and D). Although these two p-peptides have the same nominal masses, they actually eluted at different times during LC separation. These eluted after the non-phosphorylated peptide and were well separated chromatographically, giving two distinct elution peaks (supplemental Fig. S1C). Based on the MS/MS analyses (Fig. 1, D and E), peak I represents the Ser10 p-peptide and peak II represents Ser12 p-peptides (supplemental Fig. S1, E and F). Although the non-phosphorylated peptide was obtained from the GST-K62A mutant, no visible corresponding phosphorylated peptides were detected in either the XIC or its time-of-flight MS traces (supplemental Fig. S1, D and G). Therefore, we conclude that neither Ser10 nor Ser12 were phosphorylated in the K62A mutant. In addition, no other phosphorylation was detected in this mutant after in vitro phosphorylation, indicating that this mutant indeed completely lacks kinase activity. Similarly, no phosphorylation was found in the c-terminal truncation (Delta-C) mutant (data not shown). To investigate the potential function of two of the identified phosphorylation"

The oxygen tension in vivo is significantly lower than that in the air and can vary widely depending on the tissue as well as on perfusion and oxygen consumption. How oxygen tension affects IRSs and their functions is poorly understood. Our findings indicate that transient hypoxia (1% oxygen) leads to caspase-mediated cleavage of IRS-1 without inducing cell death. The IRS-1 protein level rebounds rapidly upon return to normoxia. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) appear to be important for the IRS-1 cleavage because tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor was decreased in hypoxia and IRS-1 cleavage could be blocked either with H2O2 or with vanadate, each of which inhibits PTPs. Activity of Akt, a downstream effector of insulin and IGF-1 signaling that is known to suppress caspase activation, was suppressed in hypoxia. Overexpression of dominant-negative Akt led to IRS-1 cleavage even in normoxia, and overexpression of constitutively active Akt partially suppressed IRS-1 cleavage in hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia-mediated suppression of Akt may induce caspase-mediated IRS-1 cleavage. In conclusion, our study elucidates a mechanism by which insulin and IGF-1 signaling can be matched to the oxygen level that is available to support growth and energy metabolism.

Phosphorylation of these serine residues has an attenuating effect on insulin/IGF-1 signaling by suppressing IR-IRS interaction and IRS tyrosine phosphorylation after prolonged exposure to insulin or to inflammatory signals.Cellular oxygen tension is governed by a number of factors including the oxygen tension of the blood, the rate of perfusion, the distance from the nearest capillary, and the rate of oxygen consumption by neighboring cells (37Tsai A.G. Johnson P.C. Intaglietta M. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 933-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Although the partial pressure of oxygen in the air at sea level is 149 mm Hg (20%), it is considerably lower in vivo. The oxygen tension in arterioles ranges from 10 to 80 mm Hg depending on the diameter of the arteriole and the location. In capillaries, the tension ranges from 10 to 70 mm Hg and in veins from 10 to 40 mm Hg. The oxygen tension in the tissues decreases exponentially as a function of the distance from the blood vessels and varies depending on the tissue. The mean oxygen tension of the spleen, thymus, and myocardium are ∼20, 10, and 5–15 mm Hg, respectively (38Hale L.P. Braun R.D. Gwinn W.M. Greer P.K. Dewhirst M.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1467-H1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The tissue oxygen tension can be further diminished in pathological conditions. For example, the oxygen tension can be severely reduced in tissues distal to an obstructed blood vessel. These types of severe hypoxia can lead to cell death and to tissue or organ damage. A more subtle fluctuation of cellular oxygen tension can occur in the setting of capillary recruitment and derecruitment. In endothelial cells, Akt phosphorylates and activates endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS), increasing the production of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide, which in turn recruits capillaries and increases the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to cells (39Fulton D.

Although individuals suffering from sleep apnea tend to be obese, hypoxemia is an independent risk factor for insulin resistance (42Harsch I.A. Schahin S.P. Radespiel-Troger M. Weintz O. Jahreiss H.

After 40 h, the confluent transfected cells were placed into a hypoxic chamber (Hypoxia Work Station, Biotrace Inc.) for 6 h or left in the tissue culture incubator. Cells were then harvested by scraping into radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Hypoxic samples were harvested in the hypoxic chamber. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The hypoxic samples from mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF), 3T3L1, and MCF7 cells were produced in the same manner.Antibody and Immunoblotting—β-Actin, phospho-Akt, and phospho-IRS-1 (Ser-302, Ser-612) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. IRS-1 antibody, phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), and PI3K antibody were purchased from Upstate. IRS-2, IR, IGF-IR, hemagglutinin tag, IRS-1(A-19), and actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PTP1B antibody was purchased from Oncogene Research. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and were used at dilutions of 1:5000. ECL-Plus reagent was purchased from Amersham Biosciences.Degradation of IRS-1 in Vitro by Caspases—293T cells were transfected with a human IRS-1 expression vector. After 48 h, IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-IRS-1 antibody (Upstate catalog no. 06-248) and protein A/G beads (Pierce). The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and once with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and divided equally into nine tubes. Digestion with caspases (Calbiochem) was performed according to the manufacturer’s directions using 1 unit of each caspase at 37 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 20 μl. Digested samples were analyzed by electrophoresis using 4–12% acrylamide gels followed by immunoblotting.Treatment of Cells with Caspase 3/7 Inhibitor—293T cells transfected with plasmid expressing human IRS-1 were treated with 20 μm Z-DEVD-fmk (Calbiochem, stock, 2 mm in Me2SO) 30 min prior to hypoxic treatment (2 h). HeLa cells were treated with 17 μm Z-DEVD-fmk beginning 30 min prior to hypoxic treatment (3 h).DNA Fragmentation Assay—Confluent HeLa or 293T cells transfected with human IRS-1 were treated or not with 2 μm staurosporine overnight or for the indicated times and harvested by scraping into phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were divided in two so that both protein and genomic DNA could be extracted. Genomic DNA was harvested by using a DNA ladder kit (Biovision) and was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Simultaneously, confluent HeLa or 293T cells transfected with human IRS-1, which had been incubated in normoxia or 1% oxygen for 5 or 2 h, respectively, as well as untreated controls were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline. Each sample was divided in two and analyzed as above.Soluble and Insoluble Fractionation—293T cells were ∼98% confluent. Following normoxia or hypoxia (6 h), cells were scraped into radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. They were centrifuged for 20 min. The supernatant was the soluble fraction. The pellet was washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and then extracted with urea buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 8 m urea) to obtain the insoluble fraction.Plasmid Constructs—IRS-1 deletion mutants were prepared from a human IRS-1 expression vector (from M. Quon) by using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following oligonucleotides: P1213 (del 1), 5′-CAATGGCCACCGCTGCACCCCCTCCGACTGCTACTACG-3′; P1212 (del 2), 5′-CCTTGCACAGGTGACTACGACTACATGACCATGCAG-3′; P1217 (del 3), 5′-GCTGCTAGCATTTGCAGGCCAGAGGACCGTCAGTAG-3′; P1195 (del 4), 5′-GAGCGATGGCTTCTCGGACCCCCTTGAGAGCTGCTTC-3′; P1196 (del 5), 5′-GCCCCCAAACGCTCGATCAAGGGCCACCACGACGGAG-3′; P1189 (del 6), 5′-CGTGCCCCCAGGACCCGCAGAGTTCCGCCCTCGCAGC-3′; P1197 (del 7), 5′-CATGCGGGCCATGAGTGATCCCTCCGACTGCTACTACGGC-3′; P1198 (del 8), 5′-CCTTGCACAGGTGACTACCCAGAGGACCGTCAGTAG-3′.pG716 is an expression vector consisting of rat IRS-1 in plasmid pMM. pG674 is an expression vector consisting of mouse IRS-2 cDNA in plasmid pCis-2 (from M. Quon). p1206 was generated from plasmid pG716 by destruction of the AflII site by Klenow polymerase fill-in of AflII-digested plasmid. The AflII site was reintroduced at nucleotide 1312 by site-directed mutagenesis, as described above, using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CCGAAGTTCCTTAAGCAGTGTCACCCCAG-3′. IRS-1·IRS-2 fusion proteins were generated by PCR of mouse IRS-2, restriction digest, and exchange with the corresponding rat IRS-1 fragment in p1206. The primers used were as follows: P1209 (ch1), 5′-AATTACCAAGCTTTTATGGCTAGCGCGCCCCTGCCTGGG-3′ and 5′-GTGGCTTAAGGGTCTATCCATGCTC-3′ (PCR products were digested with HindIII and AflII and cloned into HindIII/AflII-digested p1206); P1208 (ch2), 5′-AGACCCTTAAGCCACTGTGGCCGC-3′ and 5′-AATTTGCGGCCGCAACTCTTTCACGACTGTGGCTTC-3′ (PCR products were digested with AflII and NotI and cloned into AflII/NotI-digested p1206); P1207 (ch3), 5′-AATTCGGAATTCGGTGAGGCAGGTACCCGTCTGTCTC-3′ and 5′-AATTTGCGGCCGCAACTCTTTCACGACTGTGGCTTC-3′. The PCR products were digested with EcoR1 and NotI and cloned into EcoR1-NotI-digested p1206.Insulin and IGF-1 Treatment—Unless indicated otherwise, serum-starved cells were treated with 10–5 units/ml insulin (65 pm) or 125 pm IGF-1 for 5 min immediately before harvesting. Cells were treated with 60 nm insulin for 5 min immediately before harvesting (see Fig. 7c).RESULTSAlthough the functions and properties of IRSs have been extensively characterized, virtually nothing is known about how oxygen tension affects the IRS proteins. To study the effect of mild hypoxia on the IRS proteins, we incubated a confluent culture of MEFs in serum-free media overnight, after which they were incubated either in a hypoxic chamber containing 1% oxygen or in a tissue culture incubator in room air (normoxia). To ensure that the oxygen tension did not change during the experiment, the lysate preparation after hypoxia treatment was also performed inside the hypoxic chamber. We discovered that within 1–4 h of hypoxia, the IRS-1 protein level was drastically reduced (Fig. 1a). The protein level of IRS-2 and of the insulin receptor did not change significantly with hypoxia. The IRS-1 level was also drastically reduced in other cell types including 3T3-L1 and MCF7 cells (Fig. 1a). Similar results were seen in other cell lines including NIH3T3, HeLa, and 293T cells (see below), suggesting that hypoxia-induced reduction in IRS-1 levels may be a general phenomenon. However, it was possible that chamber conditions unrelated to the oxygen tension might have been responsible for the reduction in the IRS-1 level. To rule out this possibility, we exposed MEFs to 5% oxygen in the same chamber (Fig. 1b). Whereas IRS-1 was almost undetectable after 4 h in 1% oxygen, the IRS-1 level was only slightly reduced in 5% oxygen, confirming that the reduction of the IRS-1 level was oxygen-dependent. We measured the IRS-1 mRNA level with real-time PCR and detected no significant decrease with hypoxia (data not shown), suggesting that the hypoxia-induced reduction in IRS-1 levels occurred at the level of translation or post-translation.FIGURE 1The protein level of IRS-1, but not IRS-2, is decreased in hypoxia. a, IRS-1 and IRS-2 levels in cells exposed to hypoxia. Confluent MEF (wild-type), 3T3-L1, and MCF7 cell lines in serum-free media were exposed to normoxia (N; atmospheric oxygen) or hypoxia (H; 1% oxygen) in a hypoxic chamber for the indicated lengths of time. Cell extracts from the hypoxic cells were prepared in the hypoxic chamber. After the extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a filter, they were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for IRS-1, IRS-2, or actin. b, IRS-1 level in MEFs exposed to 5 and 1% oxygen for the indicated lengths of time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been shown previously that prolonged treatment with insulin also leads to degradation of IRS-1 protein (43Rice K.M.

Ser/Thr hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 and -2 can be induced with the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid in the absence of insulin treatment, indicating that there is basal Ser phosphorylation. Treatment of cells with okadaic acid resulted in an electrophoretic mobility shift of IRS-1, a consequence of Ser/Thr hyperphosphorylation. Indeed, okadaic acid treatment dramatically increased the phosphorylation of Ser-302 and Ser-612 in IRS-1 (Fig. 2a). If reductions of the IRS-1 level by hypoxia and by chronic insulin treatment were mediated by the same biochemical pathway, phosphorylation of Ser-302 and Ser-612 and gel mobility shift should occur prior to the reduction of IRS-1 level by hypoxia. However, phosphorylation of Ser-302 and Ser-612 and gel mobility shift were not induced by hypoxia. It is possible that Ser-302 and Ser-612 were not phosphorylated because the cells were not exposed to hypoxia long enough. However, this is unlikely to be the case because the presence of okadaic acid during exposure (4 h) to hypoxia prevented reduction of IRS-1 levels (Fig. 2b). Taken together, these results indicate that the reduction of IRS-1 level by hypoxia and by chronic insulin treatment occurs through different pathways.FIGURE 2Hypoxia-induced reduction of IRS-1 level is not mediated by proteasomal degradation. a, After 2 h in hypoxia (H), before the IRS-1 level was decreased, 293T cells were treated with two different doses of okadaic acid for 1 h. Cells exposed to normoxia (N) were used as controls. Cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody specific for IRS-1, phosphorylated Ser-302 and Ser-612 in IRS-1, IRS-2, and actin. b, treatment with okadaic acid restores IRS-1 level in hypoxia. 293T cells exposed to hypoxia for 4 h were treated with okadaic acid for 1 h. Cell extracts were processed as described for panel a. c, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (MG) did not block the reduction of the IRS-1 level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The reduction in IRS-1 level after prolonged insulin (45Sun X.J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1489-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) treatment is mediated by proteasome-dependent degradation. To determine whether proteasome-dependent degradation decreases IRS-1 levels in hypoxia, hypoxic cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. As shown in Fig. 2c, MG132 did not prevent IRS-1 degradation in hypoxia. Taken together, these findings indicate that the hypoxia-induced decrease in IRS-1 levels is not mediated by Ser/Thr hyperphosphorylation and proteasome-mediated degradation and therefore is mechanistically different from the insulin-induced degradation of IRS-1.We then asked whether the caspase pathway (49Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), which is induced by apoptotic signals but suppressed by survival signals, might be responsible for IRS-1 degradation. First, we examined whether transient hypoxia affected caspase 3 activation. As shown in Fig. 3a, cleavage of procaspase 3 to active caspase 3 increased with hypoxia. Then, we tested a panel of recombinant caspases to determine whether caspases are capable of degrading IRS-1 directly (Fig. 3b). IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from cells with IRS-1-specific antibody and incubated with recombinant caspases 1–10. Caspases 3 and 7 had very potent IRS-1-degrading activity, and caspase 10 had significant but weaker IRS-1-degrading activity. To determine whether caspases 3 and 7 mediated hypoxia-induced cleavage of IRS-1 in cells, we incubated hypoxic cells with Z-DEVD-fmk, an inhibitor of caspases 3 and 7 (50Vasilakos J.P. Lynch T.

Among factors that control dendritic development, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to regulate dendritic length and complexity of cortical neurons. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie these effects remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the role of amino acid transport in mediating the effects of BDNF on dendritic development. We show that BDNF increases System A amino acid transport in cortical neurons by selective up-regulation of the sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter (SNAT)1. Up-regulation of SNAT1 expression and System A activity is required for the effects of BDNF on dendritic growth and branching of cortical neurons. Further analysis revealed that induction of SNAT1 expression and System A activity by BDNF is necessary in particular to enhance synthesis of tissue-type plasminogen activator, a protein that we demonstrate to be essential for the effects of BDNF on cortical dendritic morphology.

Together, these data reveal that stimulation of neuronal differentiation by BDNF requires the up-regulation of SNAT1 expression and System A amino acid transport to meet the increased metabolic demand associated with the enhancement of dendritic growth and branching. Development of the nervous system proceeds through a sequence of complex ontogenetic processes that includes cell proliferation, migration, neurite outgrowth, axon guidance, and synapse formation (1Jessel T.M. Sanes J.R. Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Jessel T.M. Principles of Neural Science. 2000: 1019-1113Google Scholar). Neuronal development is determined by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Among the latter, neurotrophic factors play a key role. In particular, BDNF, 2The abbreviations used are: BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; SNAT, sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; MeAIB, (methylamino)isobutyric acid; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; LTP, long term potentiation; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; RT, reverse transcription; Ctrl, control. 2The abbreviations used are: BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; SNAT, sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter; tPA, tissue-type plasminogen activator; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; MeAIB, (methylamino)isobutyric acid; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; LTP, long term potentiation; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; RT, reverse transcription; Ctrl, control. a member of the neurotrophin family, controls the survival and differentiation of specific neuronal populations in the peripheral and central nervous system (2Bibel M. Barde Y.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2919-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). In the developing visual cortex, BDNF has been shown to regulate the dendritic growth and complexity of pyramidal neurons (3McAllister A.K. Lo D.C. Katz L.C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 4McAllister A.K. Katz L.C. Lo D.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 767-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of BDNF in pyramidal neurons of the visual cortex leads to sprouting of basal dendrites and regression of dendritic spines (5Horch H.W. Kruttgen A. Portbury S.D. Katz L.C. Neuron. 1999; 23: 353-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Because dendritic morphology determines the number, pattern, and types of synapses received by a neuron, regulation of cortical dendritic growth and branching by BDNF is likely to play a major role for the proper functioning of the brain and especially the cerebral cortex.Although BDNF regulates cortical dendritic development, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these effects. In particular, the role of amino acid transport in mediating the effects of BDNF on dendritic growth and branching remains unknown.System A is a ubiquitous amino acid transport system that mediates the Na+-dependent transport of short-chain neutral amino acids such as alanine, serine, and glutamine (6Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). In addition, System A is the major amino acid transport system subject to regulation by environmental conditions, proliferative stimuli, developmental changes, hormones, and growth factors (6Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). During gestation, inhibition of System A-mediated amino acid transport is associated with intrauterine growth retardation (7Cramer S. Beveridge M. Kilberg M. Novak D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C153-C160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, three isoforms of the System A family of transporters have been cloned and termed sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter (SNAT)1, SNAT2, and SNAT4 (8Mackenzie B. Erickson J.D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). SNAT1 is found primarily in the brain, SNAT2 is expressed ubiquitously in mammalian tissues, and SNAT4 is restricted almost exclusively to the liver (8Mackenzie B. Erickson J.D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). A role has been proposed for SNAT1 in supplying glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons with glutamine, the preferred precursor for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA (9Armano S. Coco S. Bacci A. Pravettoni E. Schenk U. Verderio C. Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. Matteoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10467-10473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Mackenzie B. Schafer M.K. Erickson J.D. Hediger M.A. Weihe E. Varoqui H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23720-23730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, recent data have revealed that SNAT1 is not observed in axon terminals but is localized almost exclusively to the somatodendritic compartment of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (11Melone M. Quagliano F. Barbaresi P. Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. Conti F. Cereb. Cortex. 2004; 14: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that the physiological role of SNAT1 in the brain remains controversial.In the present study, we examined the role of System A and SNAT1 in the regulation of cortical dendritic development by BDNF. We show that stimulation of cortical neurons by BDNF up-regulates SNAT1 expression and System A amino acid transport. Induction of SNAT1 expression and System A activity is required for the increase in dendritic length and branching of cortical neurons in response to BDNF. We also provide evidence that up-regulation of SNAT1 expression and System A activity by BDNF is necessary to enhance levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), a protease whose secretion is essential for the effects of BDNF on dendritic morphology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—All experiments were performed in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures. Primary cultures of cerebral cortical neurons were prepared from 17-day-old Swiss mice embryos as described previously (12Fiumelli H. Jabaudon D. Magistretti P.J. Martin J.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). If not otherwise indicated, cells were plated at a density of 55,000/cm2 on culture plates or glass coverslips in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) and 500 μm glutamine. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293; Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 25 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin and kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 95% air, 5% CO2.Dendritic Analysis—Cortical neurons were grown at a density of 1400 cells/cm2 to allow morphological analysis of single neurons. After 3 days in culture, cortical neurons were exposed to 10 ng/ml BDNF with or without 20 mm MeAIB or 2 μm tPA stop and immunostained for MAP2. Neurons were traced in a blind manner using a microscope equipped with ×63 and ×100 objectives, epifluorescence, a Lucivid camera system (Micro-BrightField Inc., Williston, VT), and the Neurolucida software (MicroBrightField Inc.). As Sholl analysis of preliminary studies revealed that the effects of BDNF on dendritic length and branching were maximal within a radius of 80 μm from the cell body (not shown), data presented in this study include analysis of dendritic morphology within this radius. When the effects of SNAT1 siRNA and control (Ctrl) siRNA were tested, cortical neurons were cotransfected 2 days after plating with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression vector pEGFP (0.1 μg/well; Clontech, Basel, Switzerland) together with SNAT1 siRNA or Ctrl siRNA (0.5 μg/well). One day after transfection, neurons were treated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml BDNF in Neurobasal/B27 medium and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. EGFP-positive neurons were traced and analyzed using Neurolucida software.RT-PCR and DNA Constructs—4 μg of total RNA extracted from cultured cortical neurons using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) were reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. SNAT1, SNAT2, and SNAT4 cDNA fragments were PCR-amplified using the following primers: SNAT1 forward 5′-ACAGCCATCTGGAGAAAAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGTTCTTCAAGAGACACAGC-3′; SNAT2 forward 5′-CGAACAGTTGGGACATAAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTTGGACACGTTCATCATCC-3′; SNAT4 forward 5′-TGCCGAAAGTCAGAAGTTCC-3′ and reverse 5′-CGGACACAAATAAGACGAGG-3′. The SNAT1 and SNAT2 PCR products were T/A-subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Wallisellen, Switzerland) and used to produce riboprobes for Northern blots. To generate hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged SNAT1 (HA-SNAT1) plasmid, the complete coding sequence of SNAT1 was amplified by RT-PCR using the following primers (SNAT1 forward 5′-GGGGTACCCATTTCAAAAGTGGCCTCGAG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGAATTCTCAGTGGCCTTCGTCGGTGCCA-3′) and then subcloned into the KpnI and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) containing a 5′ HA tag.Small Interfering (si) RNAs—SNAT1 and control (no significant sequence homology to any known mammalian gene) 21-nucleotide duplexes were designed and synthesized by Qiagen (Basel, Switzerland). The target sequence for SNAT1 siRNA was 5′-AACGAACTTCCTTCAGCCATA-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 511–531 of the mouse SNAT1 cDNA sequence.Transfection—Transfection of plasmid as well as cotransfection of plasmid with siRNA were performed using the Transfectin reagent (1 μl/well in 24 well plates; Bio-Rad, Glattbrugg, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. When siRNA duplexes (2.5 μg/35 × 10-mm plate) were transfected alone, GeneSilencer reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Axon Lab, Baden-Daöttwil, Switzerland) was used following the manufacturer’s manual.Immunocytochemistry—Immunostaining was performed as described previously (13Burkhalter J. Fiumelli H. Allaman I. Chatton J.Y. Martin J.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8212-8220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cortical neurons were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde except for double-labeling experiments with GABA and MAP2 antibodies where cortical neurons were fixed in a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Mouse anti-MAP2 antibody (Sigma, Basel, Switzerland), rabbit anti-SNAT1 antibody (J. D. Erickson), rabbit anti-GABA (Sigma), and CY3-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, La Roche, Switzerland) were used at a final dilution of 1/100, 1/2000, 1/15,000, and 1/500, respectively. Glass coverslips were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).[14C]α-(Methylamino)isobutyric Acid ([14C]MeAIB) and [3H]Glutamine Uptake—After 3–6 days in vitro, cortical neurons grown on 35 × 10-mm plates were treated with 10 ng/ml BDNF in HEPES buffer (in mm: 10 HEPES, pH 7.0; 140 NaCl; 7.5 NaHCO3; 2 KCl; 2 CaCl2; 3 MgSO4, 2 KH2PO4; 5 glucose). At the end of the stimulation, uptake was performed for 20 or 3 min at 37 °C in the same medium containing either 0.5 μCi/ml [14C]MeAIB (specific activity, 51.5 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Geneva, Switzerland) or 2 μCi/ml [3H]glutamine (specific activity, 49 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare, Otelfingen, Switzerland), respectively. For [3H]glutamine uptake, the HEPES buffer also included 50 μm unlabeled glutamine and 20 mm 2-aminobicyclo (2, 2, 1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid to inhibit glutamine uptake mediated by System L. Indeed, [3H]glutamine uptake by cortical neurons was primarily mediated by System L (66.3 ± 1.1% of total [3H]glutamine uptake, n = 6), whereas contribution by System A (MeAIB-sensitive uptake) was less than 30% (27.2 ± 1.1% of total [3H]glutamine uptake, n = 6). The uptake was terminated by three washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were lysed in 2 ml of 10 mm NaOH; 0.1% Triton X-100. Aliquots of 500 μl were assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting, and protein content was determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Lausanne, Switzerland). For kinetic analysis, [14C]MeAIB uptake was measured in HEPES buffer containing increasing concentrations of unlabeled MeAIB. For each MeAIB concentration, [14C]MeAIB was adjusted to keep the [14C]MeAIB/MeAIB concentration ratio constant. Nonspecific tracer binding was determined by measuring cell-associated radioactivity in the presence of an excess of unlabeled MeAIB (20 mm) or glutamine (10 mm). Nonspecific binding to cells accounted for 8.47 ± 1% of total [14C]MeAIB uptake (n = 15 from five independent experiments) and for 12 ± 1.2% of total [3H]glutamine uptake (n = 10 from three independent experiments). Nonspecific uptake was subtracted from total uptake to yield specific uptake values.LDH Release—LDH release into the culture supernatant was quantified using a sensitive detection kit (Cytotoxicity Detection kitPlus (LDH), Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).MTT Reduction—Measurement of cellular MTT reduction was performed as described (14Stella N. Pellerin L. Magistretti P.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3307-3317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Protein Synthesis—Analysis of protein synthesis was performed as described previously (13Burkhalter J. Fiumelli H. Allaman I. Chatton J.Y. Martin J.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8212-8220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Zymography—tPA activity was assayed by zymography as described previously (12Fiumelli H. Jabaudon D. Magistretti P.J. Martin J.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Bands of caseinolysis at ∼68 kDa corresponding to the molecular weight of tPA were analyzed using ScionImage Software, version Beta 4.0.2 (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD).Northern Blotting—Northern blots were carried out using a previously described procedure (12Fiumelli H. Jabaudon D. Magistretti P.J. Martin J.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 32P antisense SNAT1 and SNAT2 riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription of a linearized pGEM-T Easy vector containing the corresponding cDNA fragment (see “RT-PCR and DNA Constructs”).Western Blotting—Western blots were performed as described previously (13Burkhalter J. Fiumelli H. Allaman I. Chatton J.Y. Martin J.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8212-8220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunodetection of SNAT1, SNAT2, hemagglutinin, and β-tubulin, blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with an antibody against SNAT1 (1/2000; J. D. Erickson), SNAT2 (1/2000; J. D. Erickson), hemagglutinin (1/1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Bioconcept, Allschwil, Switzerland), or β-tubulin (1/1000; Sigma), respectively.Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed for statistical significance by using one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc test except for time course analysis of MeAIB uptake where one-way analysis of variance was followed by Dunnett post hoc test.RESULTSRegulation of System A Amino Acid Transport by BDNF—System A can be distinguished from the other neutral amino acid transport systems by its ability to transport N-methylated amino acids such as the nonmetabolizable amino acid analog MeAIB (15Christensen H.N. Oxender D.L. Liang M. Vatz K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 3609-3616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of System A amino acid transport activity by BDNF was examined by measuring MeAIB uptake. We found that treatment of cortical neurons with BDNF caused a marked increase in MeAIB uptake (Fig. 1). Time course analysis revealed that MeAIB uptake enhanced significantly after 20 min and reached maximal levels (179.4 ± 7.6% of control) after 5 h of stimulation by BDNF (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that BDNF increases System A activity in cortical neurons. In neurons, System A plays an important role in the Na+-dependent transport of glutamine, the primary precursor for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA (16Su T.Z. Campbell G.W. Oxender D.L. Brain Res. 1997; 757: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This led us to examine the effect of BDNF on glutamine transport, and we found that BDNF also markedly increased glutamine uptake by cortical neurons (Fig. 1B). Regulation of System A activity by BDNF was further characterized by performing kinetic analysis of MeAIB uptake in control and BDNF-treated cortical neurons. The rates of MeAIB uptake in control and BDNF-treated cultures exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 1C). Double-reciprocal plots of MeAIB uptake rate versus extracellular MeAIB concentration revealed that the Vmax of MeAIB uptake increased significantly from 10.5 ± 0.9 to 18.3 ± 2.5 pmol/mg of protein/min when cortical neurons were exposed to BDNF (Fig. 1D). In contrast, no significant effect was observed on the Km value as Km was 447.4 ± 14.2 μm in control neurons and 410.5 ± 65.6 μm in BDNF-treated neurons (Fig. 1D). The increased Vmax value of MeAIB uptake in response to BDNF provides evidence that BDNF enhances the number of functional System A transporters in cortical neurons. Because we have previously shown that treatment of cortical neurons with BDNF increases overall protein synthesis (13Burkhalter J. Fiumelli H. Allaman I. Chatton J.Y. Martin J.L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8212-8220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the role of System A amino acid transport in BDNF-induced protein synthesis. Treatment of cortical neurons with an excess of MeAIB to competitively inhibit System A amino acid transport caused a complete suppression of BDNF-induced protein synthesis (Ctrl = 100 ± 2%, BDNF = 129.8 ± 2.1%, BDNF + MeAIB = 92.45 ± 1.99%, n = 12). These data indicate that up-regulation of System A amino acid transport is necessary for the increased protein synthesis by BDNF.Up-regulation of System A Amino Acid Transport Is Required for the Regulation of Dendritic Morphology by BDNF—Because BDNF regulates dendritic development of cortical neurons (3McAllister A.K. Lo D.C. Katz L.C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 4McAllister A.K. Katz L.C. Lo D.C.

Cortex. 2000; 10: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), we investigated whether up-regulation of System A transport contributes to the effects of BDNF on the dendritic morphology of cortical neurons. To address this issue, cortical neurons were stimulated by BDNF in the presence of the amino acid analog MeAIB, and the dendritic morphology was analyzed. When compared with untreated cultures, neurons exposed to BDNF exhibited an increased number of branch points (Fig. 2, A and B). In marked contrast, treatment of cortical neurons with MeAIB completely suppressed the effect of BDNF on dendritic branching (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that stimulation of System A amino acid transport is required for the regulation of cortical dendritic morphology by BDNF. Suppression of BDNF-induced dendritic development by MeAIB did not result from a decrease in neuronal viability, as determined by LDH release and MTT reduction (Fig. 3, A and B). Further analysis of the regulation of dendritic branching by BDNF showed that BDNF increased the number of branch points in both GABAergic (21.5% of the total neuronal population) and non-GABAergic neurons, although the effect of BDNF was more pronounced in non-GABAergic cells (Table 1). In addition, inhibition of System A amino acid transport by MeAIB suppressed BDNF-induced dendritic branching in both populations of cortical neurons (Table 1).FIGURE 2Regulation of cortical dendritic morphology by BDNF requires stimulation of System A amino acid transport.

Data are the mean ± S.E. percentages of Ctrl values of quadruplicate determinations from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Role of System A amino acid transport in BDNF-induced dendritic branching of cortical GABAergic and non-GABAergic neuronsDendritic branch points in non-GABAergic neuronsDendritic branch points in GABAergic neurons% of Ctrl% of CtrlCtrl100 ± 5.5%100 ± 8.3%BDNF159.5 ± 9.8%***127.8 ± 7.9%*BDNF + MeAIB114.4 ± 12.9%xx86.1 ± 8.1%xx Open table in a new tab BDNF Increases SNAT1 Expression—To investigate further the role of System A in the regulation of neuronal differentiation by BDNF, we examined the System A amino acid transporter isoform involved in the effects of BDNF on the dendritic development of cortical neurons. In agreement with the tissue distribution of SNAT isoforms (8Mackenzie B. Erickson J.D. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), RT-PCR analysis revealed that SNAT1 and SNAT2 mRNAs were expressed in cultured cortical neurons, whereas SNAT4 mRNA was not detected (Fig. 4A). On the basis of these findings, we tested the effect of BDNF on the expression of SNAT1 and SNAT2. Treatment of cortical neurons with BDNF caused an up-regulation of SNAT1 mRNA expression, whereas SNAT2 mRNA levels remained unchanged (Fig. 4, B and C). Consistent with increases in SNAT1 mRNA levels, we found that BDNF enhanced SNAT1 protein expression (Fig. 4, D and E). Immunocytochemical analysis of the cellular distribution of SNAT1 in cortical neurons revealed that, in agreement with previous findings (10Mackenzie B. Schafer M.K. Erickson J.D.

To address this issue, we used RNA interference to prevent the induction of SNAT1 expression by BDNF. A small interfering RNA targeted to mouse SNAT1 mRNA (SNAT1 siRNA) abolished SNAT1 protein expression in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with HA-SNAT1 plasmid (Fig. 5A). We next tested the efficacy of SNAT1 siRNA in cortical neurons. Western blot analysis showed that transfection of cortical neurons with SNAT1 siRNA markedly reduced SNAT1 protein levels in unstimulated (86 ± 4.2% inhibition) and BDNF-stimulated cultures (73.7 ± 5.8% inhibition), indicating that the selected SNAT1 siRNA was effective in decreasing endogenous and BDNF-induced SNAT1 expression in cortical neurons (Fig. 5, B and C). Biochemical studies revealed that application of SNAT1 siRNA to cortical neurons caused a significant reduction of BDNF-induced System A activity (49.2 ± 8% inhibition, n = 9) and protein synthesis (31.4 ± 5.3% inhibition, n = 17). The role of SNAT1 in the regulation of dendritic development by BDNF was tested by transfecting cortical neurons with SNAT1 siRNA together with pEGFP as a marker of transfected neurons. Although in cultures exposed to Ctrl siRNA, BDNF enhanced the dendritic length and branching of cortical neurons, treatment of cortical neurons with SNAT1 siRNA abolished BDNF-induced dendritic length and branching (Fig. 6). Suppression of BDNF-induced dendritic development by SNAT1 siRNA was not due to a reduction of neuronal viability, as measured by LDH release and MTT reduction (Fig. 3, C and D). Together, these results indicate that induction of SNAT1 expression is required for the stimulation of cortical dendritic development by BDNF.FIGURE 5Inhibition of SNAT1 expression by siRNA.
