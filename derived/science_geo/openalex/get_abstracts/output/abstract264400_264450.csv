https://openalex.org/W2005053100,"Pollution effects on ozone raise the question of the significance of turbulence in vertical transport in the stratosphere. The aircraft in situ measurements of velocity fluctuations previously employed to estimate turbulence transport were, it is hypothesized, due to atmospheric waves, despite their classical turbulence spectrum. This new hypothesis implies that previous turbulence estimates are invalid. Experimental tests are suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2038213979,"Closely spaced heat flow surveys at four sites on the flanks of the Central Indian Ridge and the Southeast Indian Ridge delineate a pattern of oscillatory heat flow which can only result from cellular convection of oceanic bottom water through the oceanic crust and overlying sediment. These cells have a wavelength of 5 to 10 kilometers and are presently active in sea floor 18 x 10(6), 25 x 10(6), and 45 x 10(6) years old of the Crozet Basin and in sea floor 55 x 10(6) years old of the Madagascar Basin. The precise measurement of nonlinear temperature profiles makes it possible to calculate the conductive and convective heat transfer components through the sea floor. Even in the oldest sites, geothermal convection is still a major component of heat transfer through both the crust and sedimentary layers. These observations coupled with the results of earlier oceanwide geothermal studies indicate that more than one-third of the entire surface area of the world's ocean floor contains presently active geothermal convection that is cellular in plan form."
https://openalex.org/W1994521117,Analyses of predated butterflies on the forest floor at five monarch overwintering sites in Mexico and observations of birds foraging in mixed flocks indicate that individual birds of several species have learned to penetrate the monarch's cardenolide-based chemical defense. Predation is inversely proportional to colony size and appears to be one evolutionary explanation of the dense aggregations.

Surface condensates, consisting of both solid H(2)O and CO(2), formed at the Viking 2 lander site during the winter. Additional observations suggest that surface erosion rates due to dust redistribution may be substantially less than those predicted on the basis of pre-Viking observations. The Viking 1 lander will continue to acquire and transmit a predetermined sequence of imaging and meteorology data as long as it is operative."
https://openalex.org/W1994218613,"Core Y72 II I (43 degrees 15'N, 126 degrees 22'W) contains sediment of oxygen isotope stages I through 6 (substages 5a through 5e are well developed) and abundant pollen from the nearby continent, enabling us for the first time to obtain a direct marine-continental correlation of events in the last interglacial sensu lato. From stage 6 to substage 5e the vegetational record resembles that during the waning of the last glacial. During substage 5e, after a rapid increase of alder, western hemlock was abundant and significant amounts of redwood, oak, and Douglas fir appeared. These results suggest that vegetation on the adjacent continent during substage 5e was similar to that of the temperate conifer forests which developed in the Pacific Northwest during the Holocene. The vegetation record since that brief episode (which like the Eemian in northwest Europe lasted only afew thousand years) has been complex."

Satellite-like RNA's associated with plant viruses have a disease-regulating function."
https://openalex.org/W2029427578,"It has been suggested that the degree of refinement of trimming seen on Lower Paleolithic bifaces reflects the level of technical sophistication of the toolmaker. This has been tested by a series of experiments carried out at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, and related to some of the archeological assemblages there. It is concluded that advanced ideas and increased mastery over raw materials do not necessarily result in stone tools that are more refined in appearance."
https://openalex.org/W2069916412,"Four dredge hauls from near the crest and from the eastern flank of the seismically active Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge at 23 degrees to 24 degrees S, at depths of 3700 to 4300 meters, produced only low-potassium tholeiitic basalt similar in chemical and mineralogic composition to basalts characteristic of ridges and rises in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. A fifth haul, from a depth of 4000 meters on the lower flank of a seamount on the ocean side of the Indonesian Trench, recovered tholeiitic basalt with higher concentrations of K and Ti and slightly lower amounts of Si and Ca than the typical-oceanic tholeiite of the ridge. The last sample is vesicular, suggesting depression of the area since the basalt was emplaced. Many of the rocks dredged are variously decomposed and hydrated, but there is no evidence of important chemical modification toward conversion of the lava flows to spilite during extrusion or solidification."

They are intracellular rather than extracellular and have been observed between all cells of the diploid carposporophyte plus those specialized cells of the gametophyte suspected of providing nutritive materials to it."
https://openalex.org/W2067805197,"Biological-type alkanes are present in rocks of the Soudan formation that are more than 2.7 x 10(9) years old, but evidence of life in Soudan times is marginal. The distributional patterns of the alkanes from various regions in the Soudan indicate an indigenous origin of these compounds. Isotopic analyses do not confirm the compositional analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2059044515,"It has been suggested that harmonic radiation from the earth's 50- and 60-hertz power transmission lines might significantly influence the distribution of electrons in the radiation belts. On the basis of observations presented here, it seems advisable to accept such a hypothesis with caution. New evidence suggests that power-line radiation does not play any major role in the nonadiabatic dynamics of radiation belt electrons."

But the estrangement that has replaced the earlier relationship of mutual respect, while dangerous to both sides, is a mortal threat to American science."
