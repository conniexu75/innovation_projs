https://openalex.org/W1601113496,"The light-harvesting complex (LHC) of barley photosystem II (PS II) was fractionated by Deriphat-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into five different pigmented components: one subcomplex (LHC IIb) and four pigment-proteins (LHC IIa, -c, -d, and -e). No loss of chorophyll from the components occurred during fractionation, and violaxanthin is the only photosynthetic pigment that apparently occurs in thylakoids free of association with protein. Each LHC II component has a distinct stoichiometry of neoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein, chlorophyll a, and chlorophyll b. LHC IIa, -d, and -e were obtained as monomeric pigment-proteins, each of which contained one apoprotein Mr 31,000, 21,000, and 13,000, respectively. LHC IIc was also isolated as a monomer but it contained two poly-peptides of Mr 29,000 and 26,500, whereas the trimeric LHC IIb subcomplex (Mr 72,000) contained three subunits of Mr 28,000, 27,000, and 25,000, but not in equal stoichiometry. How the LHC II subunits are organized in PS II was examined. We isolated PS II subcomplexes which contained four of the LHC II subunits and the core complex (CC II) in unit stoichiometry; the relative strengths of association of the LHC II subunits with CC II are: LHC IIa greater than LHC IIc greater than LHC IIb greater than LHC IId. The LHC II subunits were associated with the native dimeric and not with the derived monomeric form of CC II. In addition, a multimeric LHC II sub-complex composed of the LHC IIa, LHC IIb, and LHC IId pigment-proteins was isolated. We propose that this LHC II subcomplex, which contained the Mr 28,000 and 25,000 subunits but lacked the Mr 27,000 subunit of LHC IIb and CC II. An LHC IIb pigmented fraction of LHC IIb and CC II. An LHC IIb pigmented fraction of Mr 250,000 was isolated which contained only the Mr 28,000 and 27,000 subunits. The LHC IIb subunits in this complex were the most highly phosphorylated on a protein basis. These data together with analyses of the chlorophyll b-less barley chlorina f2 mutant were used to construct a model for the LHC II pigment-protein arrangement in higher plant PS II."
https://openalex.org/W1578442529,"The Type I (mineralocorticoid) receptor has identical affinities in vitro for cortisol and aldosterone. It has been suggested that the selective role of aldosterone in regulating sodium homeostasis relies on the microsomal enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD). This enzyme converts cortisol to its inactive metabolite, cortisone, preventing cortisol from binding to the Type I receptor. We have isolated human cDNA clones encoding 11-HSD from a human testis cDNA library by hybridization with a previously isolated rat 11-HSD cDNA clone. The cDNA contains an open reading frame of 876 bases, which predicts a protein of 292 amino acids. The sequence is 77% identical at the amino acid level to rat 11-HSD cDNA. The mRNA is widely expressed, but the level of expression is highest in the liver. Hybridization of the human 11-HSD cDNA to a human-hamster hybrid cell panel localized the single corresponding HSD11 gene to chromosome 1. This gene was isolated from a chromosome 1 specific library using the cDNA as a probe. HSD11 consists of 6 exons and is at least 9 kilobases long. The data developed in this study should be applicable to the study of patients with hypertension due to apparent mineralocorticoid excess, a deficiency in 11-HSD activity."
https://openalex.org/W1602266368,"The cytochrome b heavy chain (gp91-phox) is expressed exclusively in terminally differentiating myelomonocytic cells. The human gp91-phox gene spans approximately 30 kilobases, and is divided into 13 exons. A ubiquitous factor that is indistinguishable from the CCAAT-binding factor CP1 interacts in vitro with the distal gp91-phox promoter CCAAT box motif. CP1 binding is prevented, however, by a CCAAT displacement protein (CDP) that binds to the region surrounding the CCAAT box. CDP DNA-binding activity is found in nuclear extracts prepared from cells in which the endogenous gp91-phox gene is transcriptionally inactive, but is absent or reduced in expressing cells, consistent with CDP functioning as a repressor of gp91-phox transcription. Introduction of gp91-phox promoter/reporter constructs into nonexpressing cells yields significantly less expression than that produced by the parental reporter vector alone. The reduction in expression is relieved when the CDP/CP1-binding site is removed from the gp91-phox promoter, confirming that it is a target for repression. No derepression is observed if the CP1-binding site is selectively mutated. Derepression of expression exhibited upon deletion of the CDP/CP1-binding site suggests that, in addition to blocking the interaction of the CCAAT-binding factor with the gp91-phox promoter, CDP may also repress transcription mediated through a distinct cis-element(s). We propose that down-regulation of CDP DNA-binding activity is a necessary step in the induction of myelomonocytic-specific expression of the gp91-phox gene."
https://openalex.org/W1590156932,"A cDNA library constructed from mRNA of rat brain was used to clone the cDNA that encodes the 30-kDa heparin-binding protein (amphoterin) that is developmentally regulated in brain and enhances neurite outgrowth in cerebral neurons. cDNA and peptide sequencing identified a dipolar sequence that has been previously found in studies of high mobility group 1 protein: the 184-amino acid cationic region is followed by a cluster of 30 anionic residues. The mRNA encoding amphoterin is also developmentally regulated; it is strongly reduced in quantity after the rapid perinatal growth phase of the rat brain. Anti-synthetic peptide antibodies raised according to the sequence of amphoterin were shown to bind specifically to the protein isolated from brain, and were used to detect amphoterin in subcellular fractions and in immunostaining of cells. Amphoterin was found in the cytoplasm of the cell soma, in the cell processes, and the substrate-attached material. In cells that are at an active stage of spreading and extending their cytoplasmic processes amphoterin was especially associated with plasma membrane filopodia. The distinct localization to the filopodia of the advancing plasma membrane suggests that endogenous amphoterin has a role in the extension of neurite-type cytoplasmic processes in developing cells. This inference is further supported by the finding that both anti-amphoterin and the anti-synthetic peptide antibodies in the culture media strongly inhibit the outgrowth of cytoplasmic processes."
https://openalex.org/W1604181359,"We screened a cDNA library of germinating rice seeds with a cDNA for aleurain (cysteine proteinase from barley) and obtained three distinct types of cDNA clones encoding three species of cysteine proteinases (oryzains alpha, beta, and gamma). The deduced amino acid sequences are distinct in part, but, on the whole, are similar to one another. The three sequences all contain the catalytic triad Cys25-His159-Asn175 (papain numbering). The three oryzains are similar to one another and also to other known cysteine proteinases such as papain and cathepsin H with respect to the sequences around the active site residues and the COOH-terminal Trp-rich region. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that oryzains alpha and beta are similar not only to each other (70% similarity) but also to actinidin and papain (about 50%), whereas oryzain gamma was rather similar to aleurain (85%) and cathepsin H (60%). Northern blot analysis revealed that the mRNAs for the three oryzains are expressed only in seeds, not in shoots or roots, and show different expression profiles during germination and when the seeds are treated with gibberellic acid. Oryzains alpha and gamma are expressed continuously during germination with a maximum expression 5 days from the start of germination, but are present in neither ripening nor ripened seeds. On the other hand, oryzain beta is expressed not only during germination, but also in ripened seeds before germination. It was noted that the expression of the three oryzain mRNAs is enhanced in different manners by gibberellic acid but is not enhanced by other plant hormones such as auxin. The induction of oryzain beta mRNA is transient, reaching a maximum in 4 h from the addition of giberellic acid and diminishing rapidly thereafter, while the induction of oryzain alpha and gamma mRNAs continues over 5 days. Thus, multiple systems involving cysteine proteinases must be differentially involved in the germination process, probably under hormonal control."
https://openalex.org/W1518294496,"We have cloned a rat cDNA encoding furin which is structurally related to yeast Kex2 protease. Products of 88 and 94 kDa were obtained by in vitro transcription/translation of the cDNA in the absence and presence of microsomes. When the cDNA was transfected into COS-1 cells, furin was expressed as a major glycosylated form of 94 kDa, accompanied by a minor proteolytic form of 86 kDa, and found to be localized in the Golgi complex. Proalbumin and complement pro-C3 are intracellularly processed into their mature forms by cleavage at the dibasic residues Arg-Arg, a common cleavage signal found in many pro-type precursors. In cells transfected with the cDNA of C3 or albumin alone, only about half of each proform expressed was processed by an endogenous activity of the cells. When furin was coexpressed, the proforms of both C3 and albumin were completely processed into their mature forms. In addition, co-expression of rat alpha 1-protease inhibitor mutant (Met352----Arg) resulted in inhibition of the endogenous and exogenous processing activities, as observed for the naturally occurring mutant Pittsburgh which has been identified as a specific inhibitor for the processing enzyme. Taken together, these results indicate that furin is an endoprotease localized to the Golgi complex and capable of processing proalbumin and pro-C3 into the mature forms."
https://openalex.org/W1484073306,"The activity of pyruvate kinase, subtype M2 (PKM2), is known to be increased by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2), one of the metabolites in the glycolytic pathway. Recently, we have shown that in vitro, Fru-1,6-P2 activated the association of monomer to form the tetrameric PKM2. To ascertain whether this mode of regulation also occurs in vivo, we prepared monomer-specific monoclonal antibody and quantified the monomer formation in situ in cultured cells by immunocytochemistry. The intracellular Fru-1,6-P2 was manipulated by the glucose concentration in the media. At the physiological concentration of glucose (4-6 mM), 30-35% of PK existed as a monomer. However, PKM2 was dissociated into monomer within minutes after cells were deprived of glucose. The maximal level of monomer was detected after 1 h at 37 degrees C. Monomer was rapidly (within minutes) converted to tetramer after addition of glucose. Furthermore, when cells cultured in 10 mM of glucose were treated with cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of the glucose transporter, a maximal level of monomer was detected within 20-30 min. Determination of Fru-1,6-P2 indicated that its intracellular concentration decreased concomitantly with the reduction in glucose concentration in the medium. These results indicate that monomer-tetramer inter-conversion is a major in vivo cellular regulatory mechanism in response to changes in the extracellular glucose concentration via Fru-1,6-P2."
https://openalex.org/W1559526379,"Rat liver alpha-mannosidase II, a hydrolase involved in the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, is an integral membrane glycoprotein facing the lumen of Golgi membranes. We have previously shown (Moremen, K. W., and Touster, O. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 10945-10951) that mild chymotrypsin digestion of permeabilized or solubilized Golgi membranes will result in the cleavage of the intact 124,000-dalton alpha-mannosidase II subunit, releasing a 110,000-dalton hydrophilic polypeptide which contains the catalytic site. Consistent with the removal of a membrane binding domain, the chymotrypsin-generated 110,000-dalton peptide was found exclusively in the aqueous phase in Triton X-114 phase separation studies, whereas the intact enzyme was found in the detergent phase. Taking advantage of this conversion in phase partitioning behavior, a purification procedure was developed to isolate the 110,000-dalton proteolytic digestion product as a homogeneous polypeptide for further characterization and protein sequencing at a yield of greater than 65% from a rat liver Golgi-enriched membrane fraction. An improved purification procedure for the intact enzyme was also developed. The two forms of the enzyme were compared yielding the following results. (a) The catalytic activity of the intact and cleaved forms of alpha-mannosidase II were indistinguishable in Km, Vmax, inhibition by the alkaloid, swainsonine, and in their activity toward the natural substrate GlcNAc-Man5GlcNAc. (b) Both the intact and cleaved forms of the enzyme appear to be disulfide-linked dimers. (c) The two forms of the enzyme contain different NH2-terminal sequences suggesting that the cleaved NH2 terminus contains the membrane-spanning domain. (d) Additional peptide sequences were obtained from proteolytic fragments and cyanogen bromide digestion products in order to create a partial protein sequence map of the enzyme. These results are consistent with a model common among Golgi processing enzymes of a hydrophilic catalytic domain anchored to the lumenal face of Golgi membranes through an NH2-terminal hydrophobic membrane-anchoring domain."
https://openalex.org/W2048371396,"Experimental confirmation of Wright's shifting balance theory of evolution, one of the most comprehensive theories of adaptive evolution, is presented. The theory is regarded by many as a cornerstone of modern evolutionary thought, but there has been little direct empirical evidence supporting it. Some of its underlying assumptions are viewed as contradictory, and the existence and efficacy of the theory's fundamental adaptive process, interdemic selection, is the focus of controversy. Interdemic selection was imposed on large arrays of laboratory populations of the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum in the manner described by Wright: the differential dispersion of individuals from demes of high fitness into demes of low fitness. A significant increase in average fitness was observed in the experimental arrays when compared to control populations with equivalent but random migration rates. The response was not proportional to the selection differential: The largest response occurred with interdemic selection every two generations rather than every generation or every three generations. The results indicate that the interdemic phase of Wright's shifting balance theory can increase average fitness and suggest that gene interactions are involved in the observed response."
https://openalex.org/W1572306092,"Several overlapping clones covering the entire mouse type II collagen gene including 10 kilobases (kb) of 5'- and 15 kb of 3'-flanking sequences were isolated from a cosmid library. The overall gene structure was determined by restriction mapping and sequencing. The gene spans 28.9 kb from the start of transcription to the polyadenylation site and contains 54 exons. It codes for a major mRNA species of 4910 bases which translates into a polypeptide of 1419 amino acids. A less abundant RNA species of 5110 bases contains additional sequences corresponding to an alternatively spliced exon 2. Except for the amino-terminal propeptide (N-propeptide) domain the exon-intron organization of the mouse pro alpha 1(II) collagen gene is remarkably similar to genes for other fibrillar collagen types. The overall identity of the coding sequences of the mouse and human type II collagen genes is 89% at the nucleotide level, but only 37 amino acid changes occur within the mature alpha 1(II) collagen chains between mouse and man. Intron sizes are also conserved between the mouse and human genes but not with the chick alpha 1(II) gene. The promoter of the mouse type II collagen gene is similar to those of the rat and human genes containing a TATA box and several G + C-rich elements but no CCAAT box. The 3'-untranslated sequence contains two regions of high homology between chick, mouse, bovine, and human genes preceding the major polyadenylation site. Additional size variation in the mRNA arises from the use of a minor polyadenylation signal. Information on conserved noncoding sequences will help in studies on the regulation of the pro alpha 1(II) collagen gene. Detailed knowledge of the gene is also necessary for site-directed mutagenesis and work with transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1531658692,"A novel Mr 17,000 heparin-binding protein was purified from culture medium conditioned by A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. This protein, designated HBp17, was found to bind the heparin-binding peptide growth factors HBGF-1 and HBGF-2 in a noncovalent, reversible manner. In addition HBp17 was found to inhibit the biological activities of both HBGF-1 and HBGF-2. Both the binding and inactivation of HBGF-1 and HBGF-2 by HBp17 were abolished by heparin. Full-length 1163-base pair HBp17 cDNA was cloned and sequenced by using the polymerase chain reaction technique. The deduced primary structure of HBp17 consisted of 234 amino acids including each of five partial peptide sequences obtained from proteolytic fragments of purified HBp17. The encoded protein included a 33-residue N-terminal signal sequence for secretion and a single potential N-linked glycosylation site. No homology with any known protein was found for the deduced primary structure of HBp17. The expression of HBp17 mRNA was found to occur preferentially in normal human keratinocytes and in squamous cell carcinomas. This pattern of HBp17 gene expression suggests that this binding protein for HBGFs 1 and 2 has a physiological role in squamous epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W54669141,"Pancreatic beta-cell-specific expression of the insulin gene is mediated, at least in part, by an enhancer element termed the rat insulin promoter element 3 (RIPES) found within the rat insulin II gene between positions -126 and -86. Here we identify three distinct factors interacting with RIPE3, namely 3a1, 3a2, and 3b1, which bind to the sequences between -100 to -90, -108 to -99, and -115 to -107, respectively. Factors 3a1 and 3b1 are beta-cell specific whereas 3a2 is ubiquitously distributed. The 3a1 site contains the consensus binding sequence (CANNTG) for a group of DNA-binding proteins called basic-helix-loop-helix proteins. We showed in this study that the 3a1 binding activity contains E12/E47, a member of the basic-helix-loop-helix protein family, or an E12/E47-like protein. Sequence comparison of the 3a2 and 3b1 binding sites suggest that they are unique and may bind to novel transcription factors. Mutation analysis of each individual binding site in transient expression experiments indicates that all of the three binding sites contribute to the enhancer activity of the RIPE3 in beta-cells. Mutation in any one of the three binding sites not only disrupts binding of the corresponding factor but decreases RIPE3 enhancer activity by 4-7-fold. The results suggest that interactions among the 3a1, 3a2, and 3b1 factors are required for maximum enhancer activity of the RIPE3 in insulin-producing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1537206072,"The high water permeability of kidney proximal tubules is of paramount importance for isotonic reabsorption of 70% of the glomerular filtrate, and water channels have been postulated to account for the high water permeability. Target analysis following radiation inactivation was used to probe the molecular size of the water channel. Samples of brush border membranes from rat renal cortex were subjected to 3-MeV electron pulses from the Van de Graaff accelerator at a temperature of -130 degrees C. The inactivation of the renal brush border enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and maltase was used for internal standardization of accumulated dose measurements in target analysis of the water channel. Osmotic water permeability was measured by following the change in scattered light intensity upon rapid mixing of vesicles with a hypertonic solution using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. The vesicle shrinkage response was biphasic and the rate of the fast phase decreased dose dependently by irradiation corresponding to a target size of 30 +/- 3.5 kDa. The total change in scattered light intensity was unaltered, indicating that irradiation did not destroy the lipid barrier. Our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that the high osmotic water permeability of renal proximal tubules results from a water channel-specific protein with a functional unit of 30 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W1576614459,"PSII particles from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were purified according to the protocol of Diner and Wollman (Diner, B.A., and Wollman, F.-A. (1980) Eur. J. Biochem. 110, 521-526) followed by ion-exchange chromatography. They contained the psbA, psbB, psbC, and psbD gene products in a 1/1/1/1 stoichiometry, cytochrome b559, and several small polypeptides, and exhibited electron transfer from donor Z to acceptor QA (40-50 chlorophylls/reducible QA). Upon ultracentrifugation and molecular sieving in the presence of either lauryl maltoside or octaethylene glycol dodecyl ether (C12E8), they behaved as monomers of 440-510 kDa, including the detergent. C12E8 preparations also contained a small proportion of a partially interconvertible dimeric form. Four small subunits were identified by N-terminal sequencing, namely a 6.1-kDa nuclear-encoded subunit and three chloroplast-encoded subunits homologous to psbE, psbK, and psbM gene products. Cytochrome b559 subunit alpha (psbE) of C. reinhardtii, but not subunit beta (psbF), was recognized by an antiserum raised against higher plant cytochrome b559. The products of the psbF, psbI, and psbN genes remained undetected, presumably because of blocked N termini. At least four polypeptides presented both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms (psbC, psbD, and psbH gene products, as well as an unidentified 5-kDa subunit)."
https://openalex.org/W1547743287,"Hepsin, a putative membrane-bound serine protease, was originally identified as a human liver cDNA clone (Leytus, S.P., Loeb, K.R., Hagen, F.S., Kurachi, K., and Davie, E.W. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 1067-1074). In the present study the human hepsin gene was localized to chromosome 19 at q11-13.2. The messenger RNA of hepsin is 1.85 kilobases in size and present in most tissues, with the highest level in liver. Hepsin is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain, and its mature form of 51 kDa was found in various mammalian cells including HepG2 cells and baby hamster kidney cells. It is present in the plasma-membrane in a molecular orientation of type II membrane-associated proteins, with its catalytic subunit (carboxyl-terminal half) at the cell surface, and its amino terminus facing the cytosol. Hepsin is found neither in cytosol nor in culture media. The results obtained suggest that hepsin has an important role(s) in cell growth and function."
https://openalex.org/W1549299892,"Tyrosine sulfate residues were identified in fibromodulin produced by tracheal chondrocytes, by tendon and sclera fibroblasts in primary culture, as well as in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a construct containing fibromodulin cDNA. The tyrosine sulfate residues were located in the N-terminal part of fibromodulin. Thus, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a deleted variant of fibromodulin lacking the N-terminal 52 amino acids following the predicted signal peptide did not contain any tyrosine sulfate residues. The substitution with keratan sulfate chains was not restricted to chondrocytes, but was also identified in fibromodulin synthesized by bovine tendon fibroblasts and sclera fibroblasts, as well as in fibromodulin isolated from tendon. Digestion of fibromodulin with N-glycosidase F reduced the apparent size of fibromodulin to that of the core protein, as predicted from sequence analysis (Oldberg, A., Antonsson, P., Lindblom, K., and Heinegard, D. (1989) EMBO J.8, 2601-2604). Thus fibromodulin from cartilage, tendon, and sclera contains N-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides, some of which are extended to keratan sulfate chains."
https://openalex.org/W1508304246,"Ubiquinone (or coenzyme Q) is a lipid component of the respiratory chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane, in which it functions in electron transport. Recent reports show that ubiquinone and ubiquinone biosynthetic enzymes are present in both mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial membranes of cells (Kalen, A., Appelkvist, E.-L., Chojnacki, T., and Dallner, G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1158-1164) although the functions that ubiquinone may play outside of the mitochondrion are not understood. To study coenzyme Q synthesis and function we cloned the 3,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoate (DHHB) methyltransferase gene by functional complementation of a yeast coenzyme Q mutant strain, defective in the COQ3 gene (Tzagoloff, A., and Dieckmann, C. L. (1990) Microbiol. Rev. 54, 211-225). This gene restores both coenzyme Q synthesis in the mutant strain and the ability to grow on media containing glycerol, a nonfermentable substrate. A one-step in situ gene replacement with the cloned DHHB methyltransferase DNA directs integration to the yeast COQ3 locus on chromosome XV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, establishing that the COQ3 locus encodes the DHHB methyltransferase structural gene. The predicted amino acid sequence of the yeast DHHB methyltransferase contains a methyltransferase consensus sequence and shows a 40% identity with an open reading frame of Escherichia coli, the gyrA5' hypothetical protein. This open reading frame is adjacent to the gyrA gene and close to the mapped location of the ubiG gene at 48 min on the E. coli chromosome. These results suggest that the E. coli gyrA5' open reading frame encodes a methyltransferase and may correspond to the ubiG gene, which is required for ubiquinone biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1499976663,"In this paper we have examined the post-translational modifications of the NH2 terminus of actin from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Like actins examined previously, this actin contains an acetylated NH2 terminus. Actins in other organisms undergo a unique post-translational processing event in which the initial amino acid(s) are removed by an actin-specific processing enzyme in an acetylation-dependent reaction. This is defined as actin processing. In yeast, actin retains its initiator Met in vivo and is thus not processed even though a rat liver actin processing enzyme can process yeast actin in vitro. This lack of actin processing appears to be a general property of fungi, as the actin from three other species, Aspergillus nidulans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Candida albicans are not NH2 terminally processed either. Yeast actin is a class I actin; its initiator Met directly precedes an acidic residue. We converted yeast actin to a class II species by inserting a Cys codon between the Met-1 and Asp-2 codons. In normal class II actins the Cys residue is removed as acetyl-Cys during processing. Neither the mutant actin nor chick beta-actin (a class I actin) are processed when expressed in yeast. S. cerevisiae thus appears to be also incapable of processing exogenous actins. Further study of the mutant actin containing a Cys at position 2 shows that 30-40% of this actin is stably unacetylated. This unacetylated actin does not have a shorter half-life than the acetylated form. From these studies we conclude that 1) NH2-terminal actin-specific processing is not required for actin function in yeast and three other fungi, 2) yeast are apparently incapable of processing any type of actin precursor, and 3) the stability of a yeast pseudo-class II actin is not affected by the acetylation state of the NH2 terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1569244310,"Prostaglandin synthesis in in vitro systems is dependent on glutathione and peroxide concentrations. We tested the effects of glutathione depletion and H2O2 exposure on prostaglandin synthesis in cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells. Depletion of glutathione using buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), diethylmaleate, and 2,4-chlorodinitrobenzene increased prostaglandin synthetic capacity. Production of prostacyclin, but not prostaglandin E2, from exogenous arachidonic acid was significantly greater than in controls. Glutathione depletion also resulted in enhanced production of prostacyclin from exogenous prostaglandin H2. These responses were not due to direct effects of glutathione-depleting agents on prostaglandin synthetic enzymes. Exposure to H2O2 also altered prostaglandin synthetic capacity in endothelial cells. While 5 microM H2O2 stimulated prostaglandin production from exogenous arachidonate, 25 and 50 microM were found to be inhibitory. Prostaglandin synthetic capacity was greater in BSO-treated cells which were exposed to 5 and 10 microM H2O2 than in cells exposed to H2O2 alone. However, prostaglandin synthetic capacity was greatly reduced in BSO-treated cells exposed to 50 microM H2O2. Thus, normal levels of cellular glutathione exert an inhibitory influence on prostaglandin synthesis. However, glutathione depletion increases the sensitivity of prostaglandin synthesis to inhibition by 50 microM H2O2."
https://openalex.org/W1655454104,"Overlapping cDNA clones encoding a low M gamma human nonmuscle caldesmon isoform (HUM 1-CaD) span the entire coding region (538 amino acids) as well as 111 base pairs (bp) of 5'-noncoding and 1249 bp of 3'-noncoding region. Northern blot probes derived from either the coding or 3'-noncoding region hybridized to a 4.3-kilobase mRNA in nonmuscle cells and a 5.2-kilobase mRNA in stomach tissue. Primer extension results indicated that the 5'-noncoding region of the HUM 1-CaD mRNA is approximately 700 bp in length and also suggested that 1-CaD mRNAs with common 5'-noncoding regions are expressed in both liver and fibroblast cells. Comparisons of the human, rat, and chicken 1-CaD amino acids sequences demonstrated that although each isoform has unique characteristics, extensive regions of conservation exist. Amino acids 27-53 and 97-127 are 100% identical in these isoforms while amino acids 297-531 of HUM 1-CaD are 94 and 85% identical to the rat and chicken 1-CaDs, respectively. In addition, the levels of HUM 1-CaD mRNA and protein appeared to be decreased by 2-4 fold in the transformed derivatives of KD and WI38 cell lines as judged by Northern and Western blot analysis. The results suggest that the decrease of 1-CaD protein in these transformed cells is a direct result of decreased 1-CaD mRNA synthesis and/or increased mRNA turnover."

https://openalex.org/W1946018878,"We have analyzed the functional domain structure of rat mammary glucosidase I, an enzyme involved in N-linked glycoprotein processing, using biochemical and immunological approaches. The enzyme contains a high mannose type sugar chain that can be cleaved by endo-beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase H without significantly affecting the catalytic activity. Based on trypsin digestion pattern and the data on membrane topography, glucosidase I constitutes a single polypeptide chain of 85 kDa with two contiguous domains: a membrane-bound domain that anchors the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and a luminal domain. A catalytically active 39-kDa domain could be released from membranes by limited proteolysis of saponin-permeabilized membranes with trypsin. This domain appeared to contain the active site of the enzyme and had the ability to bind to glucosidase I-specific affinity gel. Phase partitioning with Triton X-114 indicated the amphiphilic nature of the native enzyme, consistent with its location as an integral membrane protein, whereas the 39-kDa fragment partitioned in the aqueous phase, a characteristic of soluble polypeptide. These results indicate that glucosidase I is a transmembrane protein with a luminally oriented catalytic domain. Such an orientation of the catalytic domain may facilitate the sequential processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharide, soon after its transfer en bloc by the oligosaccharyl transferase complex in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum."

Chem. 264, 1767-1774) has proposed that the interaction of lipoprotein lipase with a class of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans is necessary for degradation to occur. To test further this hypothesis, the binding capacity of the plasma membrane for the lipase was decreased by inhibiting the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans with sodium chlorate, an inhibitor of sulfate adenyltransferase. Chlorate decreased sulfate incorporation into trypsin-releasable heparan sulfate proteoglycans to 20% of control levels. The amount of uronic acid in the trypsin-releasable heparan sulfate proteoglycans remained constant. Therefore, chlorate decreased sulfation density on heparan sulfate chains by approximately 5-fold. In the same fractions, chlorate increased the median heparan sulfate Mr measured on Sephacryl S-300. Chlorate decreased the maximum binding of 125I-lipoprotein lipase to adipocytes by 4-fold, but no significant effects on the affinity constants were observed. Chlorate increased lipoprotein lipase secretion in a dose-dependent relationship up to 30 mM. Utilizing a pulse-chase protocol, it was shown that lipase synthesis in control and chlorate-treated cells was not significantly different and that the increased secretion could be accounted for by a decreased lipoprotein lipase degradation rate. In control cells 77 +/- 11% of the synthesized enzyme was degraded whereas in chlorate-treated cells degradation was reduced to 42 +/- 9% of the synthesized amount. The present study shows that decreased sulfation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans decreases the maximum binding of the lipase for the adipocyte cell surface. Consistent with the model that binding of lipoprotein lipase to cell surface heparan sulfate is required for lipase degradation, degradation is reduced in chlorate-treated cultures. In this report it is also shown that chlorate inhibits lipoprotein lipase sulfation and that desulfation of the enzyme has no effect on its catalytic efficiency or on its binding to cultured adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1539206076,"Fatty acid ethyl ester synthase-III (FAEES-III), previously purified to homogeneity from human heart, metabolizes ethanol nonoxidatively. Using a derived partial amino acid sequence and corresponding oligonucleotide probes, the cDNA for this enzyme has been cloned from a human heart lambda gtll library. Of the five positive clones obtained, one contained a complete coding region (630 base pairs) and the entire 3'-noncoding region (41 base pairs). From this nucleotide sequence the complete 210 amino acid sequence of FAEES-III (Mr 23,307) is reported. Comparison of its amino acid sequence with that of glutathione S-transferase pi-1 suggests that they belong to the same gene family since they differ in only six nucleotides and four amino acids. The sequence of FAEES-III was also compared with those of placental glutathione S-transferase and the basic glutathione S-transferase. FAEES-III was 84% homologous with placental glutathione S-transferase but only less than 10% homologous with the basic glutathione S-transferase. Northern blots demonstrate expression of FAEES-III mRNA in normal human liver, placenta, and heart. In all cases, the mRNA for the enzyme is 0.7 kilobase in size. MCF-7 cells transfected with FAEES-III cDNA have a 14-fold increase in synthase activity and a 12-fold increase in glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity compared with control cells. MCF-7 cells transfected with GST pi-1 cDNA have a 13-fold increase in GST activity compared with control cells but no increase in synthase activity. When the supernatant of COS-7 cells transfected with FAEES-III cDNA were immunoblotted with rabbit FAEES-III antibody, a band at 24 kilodaltons was demonstrated. Thus, we have obtained the first cDNA and amino acid sequence for a human FAEES-III which also has significant GST activity, and we have identified 4 residues potentially responsible for conferring ethanol recognition to GSTs."
https://openalex.org/W1566159859,"The shift of chick embryo chondrocytes to a fibroblastic phenotype by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) has been used to examine the molecular basis of the switch from type II to type I collagen gene expression. Transcription rates of each of these three collagen genes before and after this shift were measured in nuclear run-on transcription assays with double-stranded 3'-cDNA probes specific for each of these three mRNAs. Degradation rates of each of these RNAs were calculated from the rate of decrease in the concentration of each RNA after the inhibition of synthesis with actinomycin D. The shut-off of the expression of the type II collagen gene during this shift was shown to occur at the transcriptional level, since the transcription rate of this gene decreased dramatically. The decay rate of the type II mRNA (half-life of approximately 15 h) is not significantly faster in BrdUrd-treated cells. The alpha 1(I) gene is transcribed at similar rates in untreated and shifted chondrocytes, but the steady state level of alpha 1(I) RNA in chondrocytes is only 1.5% of that in shifted cells. Although the measured degradation rate of the total alpha 1(I) RNA from untreated chondrocyte cultures is approximately the same as in shifted cells (half-life of approximately 12 h), indirect evidence suggests that this alpha 1(I) RNA is derived from a low level of fibroblast contamination of these chondrocyte cultures. The alpha 1(I) RNA synthesized by untreated chondrocytes is assumed therefore to be broken down very rapidly in the nucleus. The alpha 2(I) gene is also transcribed in untreated chondrocytes at rates similar to shifted cells but, unlike alpha 1(I) RNA, its steady state level in untreated chondrocytes is approximately 30% of its level in shifted chondrocytes. The increased level of alpha 2(I) RNA in shifted cells may be regulated in part by an increase in stability of the alpha 2(I) mRNA, which has half-lives of 5.2 and 10.4 h, respectively, in untreated and shifted chondrocytes. The alpha 2(I) RNA in the untreated chondrocytes was found to have a different 5' end from that present in the BrdUrd-shifted chondrocytes or in chick embryo fibroblasts. The presence of this altered RNA in untreated chondrocytes explains the absence of synthesis of the fibroblastic alpha 2(I) collagen polypeptide chains in these chondrocytes, despite the presence of the alpha 2(I) RNA as measured with 3' probes."
https://openalex.org/W1523804772,"An extracellular metabolite purified from Rhizobium trifolii ANU843 was established as N-acetylglutamic acid (GluNAc) by 1H NMR and Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry of its methylated product, and organic synthesis. TLC analyses indicated that extracellular accumulation of GluNAc by R. trifolii ANU843 grown in defined BIII culture medium was dependent on induction of its bacterial nodulation (nod) genes and the positive regulatory gene nodD on its symbiotic plasmid. 1H NMR analyses showed less GluNAc in fractionated culture supernatants of nodL and nodM mutant derivatives of R. trifolii ANU843. GluNAc induced three morphological responses on axenic roots of white clover seedlings: (i) root hair branching; (ii) tip swelling followed by resumed elongation of root hairs; and (iii) a slight increase in foci of cortical cell divisions, which developed into nodule-like primordia. These biological activities of extracellular GluNAc from R. trifolii ANU843 were confirmed with authentic standards of GluNAc. These results indicate that extracellular accumulation of N-acetylglutamic acid is linked to flavone-dependent metabolism involving nodD, nodL, and nodM in R. trifolii ANU843. This constitutes the first report on the structure of a nod-dependent extracellular signal from R. trifolii that can affect root hair and nodule development in white clover and whose biological activity on this host has been confirmed with authentic standards."

LDL-derived cholesterol accumulates in the lysosomes of U18666A-treated cells causing delayed LDL-mediated regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism and impaired movement of LDL-derived cholesterol to other cell membranes. As a result of impaired LDL-derived cholesterol transport, LDL-dependent growth of CHO cells is also inhibited by U18666A. By selecting for cell growth in the presence of U18666A, we have identified a CHO cell line, designated U18R, that is resistant to U18666A-inhibition of LDL-derived cholesterol trafficking. When compared to parental CHO cells, U18R cells are relatively resistant to U18666A inhibition of LDL-derived cholesterol transport as well as LDL-mediated regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism. In cell fusion experiments, the U18666A resistance observed in U18R cells displays a dominant phenotype. Identification of the U18666A-resistant factor may provide important insights toward the understanding of intracellular LDL-derived cholesterol regulation and trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1581336962,"Steroid response elements (SREs) cooperate with many different cis-acting elements including NF-1 sites, CACCC boxes, and other SREs to induce target gene expression (Schule, R., Muller, M., Otsuka-Murakami, H., and Renkawitz, R. (1988) Nature 332, 87-90; Strahle, U., Schmid, W., and Schutz, G. (1988) EMBO J. 7, 3389-3395). Induction of gene expression can be additive or synergistic with respect to the level of activation by either transactivators. Two mechanisms have been proposed for how synergism occurs: 1) cooperative binding of transcriptional activators to DNA or 2) simultaneous interaction of individually bound activators with a common target protein. We have shown previously that cooperative binding of receptors is important for synergism between two progesterone response elements (PREs). Here we showed that an estrogen response element (ERE) and a PRE can also functionally cooperate and this synergism between an ERE and a PRE is not contributed by cooperative DNA binding. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the activation domains of the progesterone receptor (PR) (C1Act) are required for synergism between two PREs and sufficient for confirming cooperative binding. However these two activation domains of PR are not sufficient for synergism between an ERE and a PRE. Additional regions within the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains are also required for synergistic interaction between two heterologous SREs."
https://openalex.org/W1585894269,"1-Butyrylglycerol (monobutyrin) is a novel angiogenic compound that is synthesized and secreted during the differentiation of 3T3-F442A preadipocytes into adipocytes. To study the regulation of monobutyrin biosynthesis we have developed an assay utilizing the lgycerol kinase enzyme from Cellulomonas to quantitate the levels of this compound in cell-conditioned medium. Analysis of several cultured cell types, including tumor cell lines, indicated that monobutyrin production is detectable only from adipocytes, reaching a steady-state concentration of approximately 1.0 microM in conditioned medium. Monobutyrin synthesis was demonstrated in vitro using [14C]butyryl-CoA with total homogenate or particulate fractions from adipocytes. Similar fractions from non-adipocyte cell lines failed to synthesize monobutyrin. This biosynthetic activity was shown to be distinct by substrate competition studies from the microsomal sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, whose activity is known to increase during adipocyte differentiation. The production of monobutyrin was hormonally regulated, as the addition of epinephrine to adipocytes caused a 10-fold increase in the amount of monobutyrin secreted. These results indicate that monobutyrin synthesis is adipocyte specific, occurs through an apparently novel particulate enzyme system, and is regulated in a hormone-dependent manner. The implications of these results for adipose physiology and angiogenesis are discussed."

(1990) Nature 345, 132-135). In the present work we have investigated the effects of the disulfide on structural properties of TnC48/82 monitored by CD spectroscopy and limited trypsinolysis. The CD spectra of the mutant protein in the oxidized form (oxTnC48/82) with and without Ca2+ are similar to the corresponding ones of the reduced and carboxamidomethylated form (CAMTnC48/82), indicating that the disulfide has essentially no effect on the overall secondary structure. The N-terminal domain of oxTnC48/82 is resistant to thermal unfolding, but that of CAMTnC48/82 is only slightly more stable than the corresponding domain of sTnC. In the presence of Ca2+ oxTnC48/82 is more resistant to trypsinolysis than sTnC whereas the rate of tryptic digestion of CAMTnC48/82 is the same as that of sTnC, indicating that peptide bonds adjacent to lysine residues at position 84 and 88, the sites of tryptic attack, are protected by the disulfide. The disulfide cross-linked N-terminal peptide of TnC48/82 does not bind TnI, unlike its reduced or carboxamidomethylated forms. Our data indicate that the disulfide between Cys48 and Cys82 stabilizes the structure of the N-terminal domain of TnC and blocks its ability to interact with TnI. The effects of the disulfide appear to be restricted to the N-terminal domain of TnC."

https://openalex.org/W1514866723,"Chicken liver mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is inactivated by o-phthalaldehyde. The inactivation followed pseudo first-order kinetics, and the second-order rate constant for the inactivation process was 29 M-1 s-1 at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C. The modified enzyme showed maximal fluorescence at 427 nm upon excitation at 337 nm, consistent with the formation of isoindole derivatives by the cross-linking of proximal cysteine and lysine residues. Activities in the physiologic reaction and in the oxaloacetate decarboxylase reaction were lost in parallel upon modification with o-phthalaldehyde. Plots of (percent of residual activity) versus (mol of isoindole incorporated/mol of enzyme) were biphasic, with the initial loss of enzymatic activity corresponding to the incorporation of one isoindole derivative/enzyme molecule. Complete inactivation of the enzyme was accompanied by the incorporation of 3 mol of isoindole/mol of enzyme. beta-Sulfopyruvate, an isoelectronic analogue of oxaloacetate, completely protected the enzyme from reacting with o-phthalaldehyde. Other substrates provided protection from inactivation, in decreasing order of protection: oxaloacetate greater than phosphoenolpyruvate greater than MgGDP, MgGTP greater than oxalate. Cysteine 31 and lysine 39 have been identified as the rapidly reacting pair in isoindole formation and enzyme inactivation. Lysine 56 and cysteine 60 are also involved in isoindole formation in the completely inactivated enzyme. These reactive cysteine residues do not correspond to the reactive cysteine residue identified in previous iodoacetate labeling studies with the chicken mitochondrial enzyme (Makinen, A. L., and Nowak, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 12148-12157). Protection experiments suggest that the sites of o-phthalaldehyde modification become inaccessible when the oxaloacetate/phosphoenolpyruvate binding site is saturated, and sequence analyses indicate that cysteine 31 is located in the putative phosphoenolpyruvate binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1493659715,"Ovoperoxidase, the enzyme that hardens the sea urchin fertilization envelope, is inserted into the assembling extracellular matrix through the action of an intermediary protein, proteoliaisin (PLN). The domain structure of PLN, a large, rod-shaped protein that binds to ovoperoxidase and the vitelline layer, was examined by limited proteolytic cleavage. Purified proteolytic fragments of PLN were tested for their ability to bind ovoperoxidase, inhibit the binding of 125I-PLN to the vitelline layer, or act as substrates for the hardening reaction. Based on these results, the vitelline layer-binding domain can be placed near the amino terminus, followed by the binding site for ovoperoxidase; the distal two-thirds of the protein contain sites for ovoperoxidase-catalyzed dityrosine formation. The pentapeptide GRGDS (but not RGD) inhibited PLN-vitelline layer binding half-maximally at 0.2 mM. Moreover, PLN promoted adhesion of bovine aortic endothelial cells to plastic dishes, a process inhibited by GRGDS. Thus PLN is a new member of the adhesive protein family, the function of which is to coordinate the morphogenesis of a specific, rapidly assembled extracellular matrix."

Staurosporine and K-252a (0.01-10 microM) did not cause large changes in catecholamine secretion evoked by Ca2+ in digitonin-permeabilized cells whereas these compounds strongly prevented TPA-induced enhancement of catecholamine secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. Incubation of digitonin-permeabilized cells with [gamma-32P]ATP resulted in 32Pi incorporation into a large number of proteins, detected as several major bands and darkened background in autoradiograms. Ca2+ and TPA increased phosphorylation of these proteins. Staurosporine and K-252a markedly inhibited Ca(2+)-induced and TPA-induced increases in protein phosphorylation as well as basal (0 Ca2+) protein phosphorylation in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Long term treatment (24 h) of adrenal medullary cells with 1 microM TPA markedly decreased total cellular protein kinase C activity to about 5.3% of control. Pretreatment of the cells with 1 microM TPA strongly inhibited the TPA-induced enhancement of catecholamine secretion whereas it did not cause large changes in total cellular catecholamine amounts, Ca(2+)-induced catecholamine secretion, and cAMP-induced enhancement of catecholamine secretion from digitonin-permeabilized cells. From these results we conclude that protein kinase C plays a modulatory role in catecholamine secretion rather than being essential for initiating catecholamine secretion."

There is a multiplicity of FF1; the FF1 activity was eluted as at least three major fractions on column chromatographies. FF1 is able to form a stable complex with the enhancer DNA sequence in the presence of another proteinous factor named FF2, which lacks ability to bind DNA molecules by itself. One of FF1 forms, FF1a, was purified with a combination of classical purification techniques without using a sequence-specific affinity column, and identified as a protein with molecular mass 125 kDa using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

FF1a, one type of FF1, has been purified to homogeneity from crude nuclear extracts of posterior silk gland cells and identified as a protein with molecular mass 125 kDa (Suzuki, T., Matsuno, K., Takiya, S., Ohno, K., Ueno, K., and Suzuki, Y. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16935-16941). FF1 is able to recognize and bind a sequence of -205 to -185 in the enhancer I of the fibroin gene in the presence of FF2. The binding sequence of FF1 with FF2 contains two repeats of the derivative of consensus sequence which is recognized by homeobox-containing proteins. Though FF1 activity to construct the major band complex I is specific to posterior silk gland cells, use of a specific antibody raised against FF1a showed that FF1 protein is ubiquitous in Bombyx cells. These results suggest the possibility that FF1 molecules present as multiple proteins might be specifically modified and activated for the binding to enhancer DNA in posterior silk gland cells. Since the FF1a antibody also inhibited a transcriptional enhancement activity governed by the enhancer sequence, we conclude that FF1 is one of the transcriptional factors of the fibroin gene. The functions of FF1 on fibroin gene transcription are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1599194755,"The pseudo EcoRI site GAATTA in the U3 region of the long terminal repeat of human immunodeficiency virus, which is flanked by a 26-base pair oligopurine tract, is readily nicked by either EcoRI or RsrI. The strand-specific nick occurs predominantly between the G and A residues and is independent of negative supercoiling. Other GAATTA sites surrounded by random (non-oligopurine) sequences are not nicked by these restriction endonucleases. However, other types and lengths of oligopurine tracts are effective in inducing the nicking in neighboring GAATTA sites. Hence, we propose that the flanking oligopurine tracts induce an altered DNA conformation on the GAATTA target site which may be similar to the transition state induced by EcoRI when binding to its canonical recognition site. Gel retardation analyses on restriction fragments containing the oligopurine-GAATTA-oligopurine sequences suggest the presence of helical axis distortions which are consistent with this interpretation."

The simplest explanation for this pattern of expression is that transcription occurs during the late G1 and early S phases and does not occur during other stages of the cell cycle. In this report, however, we show that TMP1 is subject to regulation that results in at least three different levels of expression: essentially nondetectable expression during stationary phase (G0), moderate level expression in START-arrested growing cells (START-independent), and a high level of expression in proliferating cells (START-dependent). Our analysis also shows that upstream elements important for START-independent expression and required for START-dependent expression are located within a 37-base region."
