https://openalex.org/W4281688566,"Therapeutics based on short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) delivered to hepatocytes have been approved, but new delivery solutions are needed to target additional organs. Here we show that conjugation of 2′-O-hexadecyl (C16) to siRNAs enables safe, potent and durable silencing in the central nervous system (CNS), eye and lung in rodents and non-human primates with broad cell type specificity. We show that intrathecally or intracerebroventricularly delivered C16-siRNAs were active across CNS regions and cell types, with sustained RNA interference (RNAi) activity for at least 3 months. Similarly, intravitreal administration to the eye or intranasal administration to the lung resulted in a potent and durable knockdown. The preclinical efficacy of an siRNA targeting the amyloid precursor protein was evaluated through intracerebroventricular dosing in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease, resulting in amelioration of physiological and behavioral deficits. Altogether, C16 conjugation of siRNAs has the potential for safe therapeutic silencing of target genes outside the liver with infrequent dosing. Lipophilic siRNA conjugates exert therapeutic activity in the mouse CNS."
https://openalex.org/W4281838146,"Cells in complex organisms undergo frequent functional changes, but few methods allow comprehensive longitudinal profiling of living cells. Here we introduce scission-accelerated fluorophore exchange (SAFE), a method for multiplexed temporospatial imaging of living cells with immunofluorescence. SAFE uses a rapid bioorthogonal click chemistry to remove immunofluorescent signals from the surface of labeled cells, cycling the nanomolar-concentration reagents in seconds and enabling multiple rounds of staining of the same samples. It is non-toxic and functional in both dispersed cells and intact living tissues. We demonstrate multiparameter (n ≥ 14), non-disruptive imaging of murine peripheral blood mononuclear and bone marrow cells to profile cellular differentiation. We also show longitudinal multiplexed imaging of bone marrow progenitor cells as they develop into neutrophils over 6 days and real-time multiplexed cycling of living mouse hepatic tissues. We anticipate that SAFE will find broad utility for investigating physiologic dynamics in living systems. Live cells and tissues are imaged over long time periods using a fast, non-toxic click chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W4281922323,"We tested the hypothesis that single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of human kidney allograft biopsies will reveal distinct cell types and states and yield insights to decipher the complex heterogeneity of alloimmune injury. We selected 3 biopsies of kidney cortex from 3 individuals for scRNA-seq and processed them fresh using an identical protocol on the 10x Chromium platform; (i) HK: native kidney biopsy from a living donor, (ii) AK1: allograft kidney with transplant glomerulopathy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and worsening graft function, and (iii) AK2: allograft kidney after successful treatment of active antibody-mediated rejection. We did not study T-cell-mediated rejections. We generated 7217 high-quality single cell transcriptomes. Taking advantage of the recipient-donor sex mismatches revealed by X and Y chromosome autosomal gene expression, we determined that in AK1 with fibrosis, 42 months after transplantation, more than half of the kidney allograft fibroblasts were recipient-derived and therefore likely migratory and graft infiltrative, whereas in AK2 without fibrosis, 84 months after transplantation, most fibroblasts were donor-organ-derived. Furthermore, AK1 was enriched for tubular progenitor cells overexpressing profibrotic extracellular matrix genes. AK2, eight months after successful treatment of rejection, contained plasmablast cells with high expression of immunoglobulins, endothelial cell elaboration of T cell chemoattractant cytokines, and persistent presence of cytotoxic T cells. In addition to these key findings, our analysis revealed unique cell types and states in the kidney. Altogether, single-cell transcriptomics yielded novel mechanistic insights, which could pave the way for individualizing the care of transplant recipients."
https://openalex.org/W4281965980,"Black and Hispanic/Latinx cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender women, transgender men, and gender nonbinary (TGNB) individuals have been historically underrepresented in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) clinical trials. There is an urgent need for ongoing engagement with communities that have been the most impacted by HIV and diverse representation in clinical trials. Here we describe strategic approaches undertaken in the PURPOSE 2 trial to optimize engagement of underrepresented individuals.PURPOSE 2 is an ongoing Phase 3 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of lenacapavir as PrEP in cisgender MSM and TGNB individuals. In PURPOSE 2, we used a multipronged approach aimed at enriching participation of underrepresented individuals. We conducted a review to identify evidence-informed recommendations from literature, engaged with stakeholders, and established the Global Community Advisory and Accountability Group (GCAG) to represent the needs of the community. Insights from stakeholders and GCAG members resulted in an expansion of the study population to include transgender men, gender nonbinary persons, and adolescents, and evaluation of population-specific outcomes. Feedback from stakeholders and GCAG members also informed investigator and site selection; these were selected based on prior experience working with persons from diverse racial, ethnic and gender identities, and estimates of local HIV incidence. Site selection was also expanded to include community-based clinics with services tailored towards Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and TGNB populations. We established a study-wide recruitment goal of 50% Black MSM and 20% Hispanic/Latinx MSM in US sites and 20% transgender women globally. Site-specific recruitment goals were also developed based on local demographics and HIV incidence. Mandatory trainings included Good Participatory Practice guidelines, gender inclusivity, and antiracism.While further work is needed to achieve equitable representation, the strategies we describe may serve as a framework for future clinical trials.Clinical Trial Number: NCT04925752."
https://openalex.org/W4281695949,"The Covid-19 pandemic posed new issues about vaccination and contagious diseases that had not been the focus of public policy debate in the United States since the tuberculosis pandemic of the late 19th century and the early 20th century. Using a national address-based probability sample of American adults in 2020 and a structural equation model, this analysis seeks to understand the role of education, age, gender, race, education, partisanship, religious fundamentalism, biological literacy, and understanding of the coronavirus to predict individual intention concerning taking the Covid-19 vaccine. Given the substantial changes in the United States since the tuberculosis pandemic, it is important to understand the factors that drive acceptance and hesitancy about Covid-19 vaccination. We find that education, biological literacy, and understanding of the coronavirus were strong positive predictors of willingness to be vaccinated and religious fundamentalism and conservative partisanship were strong negative predictors of intent to vaccinate. These results should be encouraging to the scientific community."
https://openalex.org/W4281848975,"Background During rapidly evolving outbreaks, health services and essential medical care are interrupted as facilities have become overwhelmed responding to COVID-19. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), more than half of countries are affected by emergencies, hospitals face complex challenges as they respond to humanitarian crises, maintain essential services, and fight the pandemic. While hospitals in the EMR have adapted to combat COVID-19, evidence-based and context-specific recommendations are needed to guide policymakers and hospital managers on best practices to strengthen hospitals’ readiness, limit the impact of the pandemic, and create lasting hospital sector improvements towards recovery and resilience. Aim Guided by the WHO/EMR’s “Hospital readiness checklist for COVID-19”, this study presents the experiences of EMR hospitals in combatting COVID-19 across the 22 EMR countries, including their challenges and interventions across the checklist domains, to inform improvements to pandemic preparedness, response, policy, and practice. Methods To collect in-depth and comprehensive information on hospital experiences, qualitative and descriptive quantitative data was collected between May-October 2020. To increase breadth of responses, this comprehensive qualitative study triangulated findings from a regional literature review with the findings of an open-ended online survey (n = 139), and virtual in-depth key informant interviews with 46 policymakers and hospital managers from 18 out of 22 EMR countries. Purposeful sampling supported by snowballing was used and continued until reaching data saturation, measures were taken to increase the trustworthiness of the results. Led by the checklist domains, qualitative data was thematically analyzed using MAXQDA. Findings Hospitals faced continuously changing challenges and needed to adapt to maintain operations and provide essential services. This thematic analysis revealed major themes for the challenges and interventions utilized by hospitals for each of hospital readiness domains: Preparedness, Leadership, Operational support, logistics, supply management, Communications and Information, Human Resources, Continuity of Essential Services and Surge Capacity, Rapid Identification and Diagnosis, Isolation and Case Management, and Infection, Prevention and Control. Conclusion Hospitals are the backbone of COVID-19 response, and their resilience is essential for achieving universal health coverage. Multi-pronged (across each of the hospitals readiness domains) and multi-level policies are required to strengthen hospitals resilience and prepare health systems for future outbreaks and shocks."
https://openalex.org/W4281660892,"The widening gap between the supply and demand for meat products has increased the need to produce plant-based meat analogs as protein sources. Meat analogs are principally composed of soy-based textured vegetable proteins. Despite ongoing technical developments, one of the unresolved challenges for plant-based meat analogs is the off-flavor from soy, which limits their consumer acceptability. Among the various methods developed for overcoming this challenge, masking the beany flavors with cyclodextrins (CDs) is an attractive, cost-effective, and safe strategy. However, the current established CD treatment method does not meet the requirement for a clean-label. This study aimed to develop more acceptable off-flavor-masking technologies for plant-based patties for modern clean-label preferences using enzymatic methods. We used the cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGT), ""Amano,"" as a commercially available food-grade CGT. The CGT-catalyzed reaction in plant-based patties yielded 17.1 g/L CD. As CGT could yield sufficient CD in the patties, we investigated whether CDs produced by CGT could mask the off-flavors released from the plant-based patties. The CGT-treated patties had significantly lower volatilization amounts of the known beany off-flavor-generating compounds compared to the non-treated patties. Moreover, CGT treatment improved the texture of the patties and increased their water- and oil-holding capacity. As CGT is rendered inactive after cooking, it would not be considered an additive. These findings indicated that CDs produced by the CGT reaction could effectively mask off-flavors of meat analogs and improve their physical properties while meeting clean-label requirements."
https://openalex.org/W4281681604,"It is well established that mechanical cues, e.g., tensile- compressive- or shear forces, are important co-regulators of cell and tissue physiology. To understand the mechanistic effects these cues have on cells, technologies allowing precise mechanical manipulation of the studied cells are required. As the significance of cell density i.e., packing on cellular behavior is beginning to unravel, we sought to design an equiaxial cell compression device based on our previously published cell stretching system. We focused on improving the suitability for microscopy and the user-friendliness of the system. By introducing a hinge structure to the substrate stretch generating vacuum chamber, we managed to decrease the z-displacement of the cell culture substrate, thus reducing the focal plane drift. The vacuum battery, the mini-incubator, as well as the custom-made vacuum pressure controller make the experimental setup more flexible and portable. Furthermore, we improved the efficiency and repeatability of manufacture of the device by designing a mold that can be used to cast the body of the device. We also compared several different silicone membranes, and chose SILPURAN ® due to its best microscopy imaging properties. Here, we show that the device can produce a maximum 8.5% radial pre-strain which leads to a 15% equiaxial areal compression as the pre-strain is released. When tested with epithelial cells, upon compression, we saw a decrease in cell cross-sectional area and an increase in cell layer height. Additionally, before compression the cells had two distinct cell populations with different cross-sectional areas that merged into a more uniform population due to compression. In addition to these morphological changes, we detected an alteration in the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of YAP1, suggesting that the cellular packing is enough to induce mechanical signaling in the epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W4281790135,"Objective To examine factors associated with cancer patients’ satisfaction using telehealth during COVID-19, including video conferencing platforms and secure messaging systems. Method Patients with cancer participated in a cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted with patients with cancer. The survey included questions about satisfaction with video-conferencing and secure messaging platforms to interact with clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine predictors of satisfaction for each telehealth platform. Results Participants generally reported positive satisfaction with each telehealth platform. Both platforms were commonly used to review medical results and discuss symptoms or treatment. Participants identifying as a man were most satisfied with their video-conferencing session, especially if they had a comfortable place to sit. Patients were more satisfied with secure messaging because they could ask a question without scheduling an appointment. Discussion When strategically used together, video-conferencing platforms and secure messaging may increase patient satisfaction in cancer care during the remainder of the pandemic and beyond. Attention must be paid to optimizing factors that promote satisfaction for each telehealth platform."
https://openalex.org/W4281669567,"In this study, the purposefulness of using the API20E biochemical identification system as a supportive tool for enhancing the discrimination of environmental bacteria by MALDI-TOF MS method was evaluated. The identification results of MALDI-TOF MS and API20E for 321 Gram-negative strains isolated from the riverine freshwater and its sediment, and from the tissues of fish from the same water body were compared. Of 190 isolates identified with probable to highly probable species-level identification, and secure genus to probable species identification, 14 isolates (7.37%) had identification score over 2.300, and from the same group 19 isolates (10%) had excellent or very good identification to the genus by API20E system. With regard to agreement at genus level, out of 231 strains with genus designation available by API20E at any level of identification reliability, MALDI-TOF MS genus identification agreed in 163 (70.6%) strains. Of these, 135 (82.8%) were Aeromonas species and the remaining isolates belonged to 7 different genera. Although API20E resulted in frequent misidentification due to a limited profile index, its individual biochemical reactions might contribute to overall characterization of isolates. For example, for all reliable A. hydrophila strain identifications with MALDI-TOF MS, ONPG, GLU and OX reactions were unarguably positive for all fish and water/sediment isolates, whereas only fish isolates yielded additional 100% positive TDA and VP reactions. Thus, after initial identification with MALDI-TOF MS, environmental isolates with lower identification scores should be further analyzed. Before commencing confirmatory testing with nucleic acid-based methods, biochemical API20E tests could be applied as a purposeful and inexpensive identification support in targeting better identification accuracy. In this study, this was particularly evident with A. hydrophila, Chryseobacterium sp. and Pseudomonas sp. This identification strategy could significantly resolve methodological and cost-related shortcomings frequently occurring with large number of environmental isolates."
https://openalex.org/W4281700577,"It is important to understand how to frame the formats for promoting HIV self-testing to increase uptake among young people. In this study, we used a culture-centered model to understand the narratives of HIV self-testing preferences among young people in Nigeria. We conducted a crowdsourcing contest to solicit ideas surrounding HIV self-testing promotion among young people (10-24 years) in Nigeria from October to November 2018 as part of the 2018 World AIDS Day event. We received 903 submissions and employed thematic content analysis to evaluate 769 eligible youth narratives. Thematic content analysis of the statements from the youth narratives was guided by the PEN-3 cultural model to examine the positive, existential, and negative perceptions (beliefs and values), enablers (resources), and nurturers (roles of friends and family) of HIV self-testing promotion among young people in Nigeria. Several themes emerged as factors that influence the uptake of HIV self-testing among young people in Nigeria. Specifically, seven themes emerged as perceptions: HIV testing accessibility, stigma reduction, and autonomy (positive); HIV self-testing kit packaging and advertisements (existential); lack of knowledge and increased stigma (negative). Seven themes emerged as enablers: social media, school, and government promotion (positive); gamification and animation (existential); high cost and access to linkage to care services (negative); And seven themes emerged as nurturers: peer, families, and faith-based communities (positive); parents and family-centered approach (existential); and partners and family (negative). Our data suggests that increased awareness around HIV self-testing on current youth-friendly platforms, de-stigmatization of HIV and HIV self-testing, decreased prices for HIV self-testing kits, reliability of testing kits, increased linkage to care services, and promotion of self-testing among family members and the community will be beneficial for HIV self-testing scale-up measures among young people in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W4281770754,"Based on the dualistic model of passion, this study explored the relationship between distinct types of work passion and career commitment, as well as the mediating role of work-family interface and the moderating role of autonomy support. A two-wave study was conducted among South Korean workers (N = 250) over a 5-month time period. Results showed that harmonious work passion was positively associated with career commitment, whereas obsessive work passion was not significantly associated with career commitment. Moreover, work-family enrichment partially mediated the positive effect of harmonious work passion on career commitment, and work-family conflict fully mediated the negative effect of obsessive work passion on career commitment. Results further indicated that autonomy support strengthens the positive effect of harmonious work passion on work-family enrichment. Furthermore, this study expanded the understanding of the underlying psychological mechanisms of effects of work passion. The implications and limitations of the study and potential topics for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4281770943,"Very little is known about the prevalence of refractive errors among children in Kazakhstan. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of refractive errors and risk factors of myopia among schoolchildren in Almaty, Kazakhstan.In the cross-sectional study of 2293 secondary school students (age 6-16), we examined cycloplegic autorefraction and offered a questionnaire in three age groups: 1st grade (N = 769), 5th grade (N = 768) and 9th grade (N = 756). The questionnaire covered main risk factors such as parental myopia, screen time, time outdoors, sports activities, near work, gender, grade, and school shift. Adjusted logistic regression analysis was applied to test the association of risk factors with myopia.The mean spherical equivalent (SER) was -0.54 ± 1.51 diopters (D). The overall prevalence of refractive errors was 31.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 29.7; 33.5); myopia 28.3% (95% CI 26.5; 30.1); hyperopia 3.4% (95% CI 2.7-4.1) and astigmatism 2.8% (95% CI 2.1; 3.5). In the multivariate adjusted regression analysis, higher class level (5th grade (odds ratio (OR) 1.78; 95% CI 1.26; 2.52) and 9th grade (OR 3.34; 95% CI 2.31; 4.82)) were associated with myopia, whereas outdoors activity more than 2 hours a day (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.46; 0.89) and sports (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.52; 0.93) were associated with a lower incidence of myopia.Myopia is a leading refractive error in schoolchildren in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Myopia prevention measures, including more time outdoors, should guide public health interventions in this population."
https://openalex.org/W4281783323,"The preset neurodegenerations in Alzheimer disease (AD) are due to several mechanisms such as amyloidogenic proteolysis, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurofibrillary tangles, cholinergic dysfunction, among others. The aim of this work was to develop multitarget molecules for the treatment of AD. Therefore, a family of 64 molecules was designed based on ligand structure pharmacophores able to inhibit the activity of beta secretase (BACE1) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as well as to avoid amyloid beta (Aβ 1–42 ) oligomerization. The backbone of designed molecules consisted of a trisubstituted aromatic ring, one of the substituents was a heterocyclic amine (piperidine, morpholine, pyrrolidine or N -methyl pyrrolidine) separated from the aromatic system by three carbon atoms. The set of compounds was screened in silico employing molecular docking calculations and chemoinformatic analyses. Based on Gibbs free energy of binding, binding mode and in silico predicted toxicity results, three of the best candidates were selected, synthesized, and evaluated in vitro ; F3S4-m , F2S4-m, and F2S4-p . All three compounds prevented Aβ 1–42 aggregation (F3S4-m in 30.5%, F2S4-p in 42.1%, and F2S4-m in 60.9%). Additionally, inhibitory activity against AChE (ki 0.40 μM and 0.19 μM) and BACE1 (IC 50 15.97 μM and 8.38 μM) was also observed for compounds F2S4-m and F3S4-m , respectively. Despite the BACE IC 50 results demonstrated that all compounds are very less potent respect to peptidomimetic inhibitor (PI-IV IC 50 3.20 nM), we can still say that F3S4-m is capable to inhibit AChE and BACE1."
https://openalex.org/W4281801838,"In spite of continuous development of gene therapy vectors with thousands of drug candidates in clinical drug trials there are only a small number approved on the market today stressing the need to have characterization methods to assist in the validation of the drug development process. The level of packaging of the vector capsids appears to play a critical role in immunogenicity, hence an objective quantitative method assessing the content of particles containing a genome is an essential quality measurement. As transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allows direct visualization of the particles present in a specimen, it naturally seems as the most intuitive method of choice for characterizing recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) particle packaging. Negative stain TEM (nsTEM) is an established characterization method for analysing the packaging of viral vectors. It has however shown limitations in terms of reliability. To overcome this drawback, we propose an analytical method based on CryoTEM that unambiguously and robustly determines the percentage of filled particles in an rAAV sample. In addition, we show that at a fixed number of vector particles the portion of filled particles correlates well with the potency of the drug. The method has been validated according to the ICH Q2 (R1) guidelines and the components investigated during the validation are presented in this study. The reliability of nsTEM as a method for the assessment of filled particles is also investigated along with a discussion about the origin of the observed variability of this method."
https://openalex.org/W4281633521,"NAFLD, regarded as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, is the most common form of liver disease in the United States. The Odd-skipped related 1 (Osr1) gene was previously reported to play a critical role in embryonic development and as a cancer repressor gene, however its role in overnutrition induced fatty liver disease has never been explored. Induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10-week, the development and the progression of NAFLD was evaluated in either Osr1 heterozygote (Osr1 group) or wildtype mice (WT group). The Osr1 mice, regardless of sex, exhibited more severe steatosis compared to WT. Upregulation of lipogenesis protein including Srebp1c was detected in the Osr1 group, together with impaired IRS2 expression and overactivated Akt/mTOR signaling. In addition, the Osr1 mice had decreased bile acid synthesis in the liver with depressed hepatic expression of Cyp7a1 and Cyp27a1. Furthermore, there was more macrophage infiltration with enhanced expression of Il-1β and TNF-α in the Osr1 liver, associated with overactivation of JNK and NF-κB signaling. In summary, our study showed that Osr1 plays an important role in regulating the lipid homeostasis and hepatic inflammation, whose disruption contributes to NAFLD progression."
https://openalex.org/W4281756807,"Among one of the key challenges in dairy production is the management of manure in a way that is beneficial for agricultural production, with minimal environmental and public health impacts. Manure management systems (MMS)-the entire system of handling, storage, and application of manure-are diverse in countries with developed dairy industries such as the United States, enabled by a number of different technologies. The ways in which dairy farmers manage manure is driven by varying tradeoffs, including economic, social, and environmental; however, existing research has not examined the relationships between components of MMS. Here we use data from the National Animal Health Monitoring System's Dairy 2014 study to explore the ways in which manure handling, storage, and application are related, using a series of logistic regression models and network associations. We found significant associations between how manure is handled, stored, and applied, especially driven by the consistency of manure. For solid manure, we found highly heterogeneous systems, where farmers may have a suite of alternative manure management strategies available to them, and substitution is viable. Conversely, farms using liquid manure systems have very few substitutes in their MMS, suggesting greater investment in certain infrastructures, which are not easily changed. Such findings have important implications for shifting farmers towards management practices with minimal environmental and public health impacts, demonstrating that not all farm systems are easily changed. We highlight these results in light of current policies, which may not fully capture the relationships across the MMS, and suggest that greater financing may be necessary to shift MMS on some farms. Furthermore, we suggest that different MMS have varying tradeoffs across environmental, social, and economic aspects, which demonstrates that MMS are highly individualized to a given farm's goals and priorities."
https://openalex.org/W4281788757,"Aims This study established blood group analysis methods using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data and conducted blood group analyses to determine the domestic allele frequency using public data from the Korean whole sequence analysis of the Korean Reference Genome Project conducted by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). Materials and methods We analyzed the differences between the human reference sequences (hg19) and the conventional reference cDNA sequences of blood group genes using the Clustal Omega website, and established blood group analysis methods using WGS data for 41 genes, including 39 blood group genes involved in 36 blood group antigens, as well as the GATA1 and KLF1 genes, which are erythrocyte-specific transcription factor genes. Using CLC genomics Workbench 11.0 (Qiagen, Aarhus, Denmark), variant analysis was performed on these 41 genes in 250 Korean WGS data sets, and each blood group’s genotype was predicted. The frequencies for major alleles were also investigated and compared with data from the Korean rare blood program (KRBP) and the Erythrogene database (East Asian and all races). Results Among the 41 blood group-related genes, hg19 showed variants in the following genes compared to the conventional reference cDNA: GYPA , RHD , RHCE , FUT3 , ACKR1 , SLC14A1 , ART4 , CR1 , and GCNT2 . Among 250 WGS data sets from the Korean Reference Genome Project, 70.6 variants were analyzed in 205 samples; 45 data samples were excluded due to having no variants. In particular, the FUT3 , GNCT2 , B3GALNT1 , CR1 , and ACHE genes contained numerous variants, with averages of 21.1, 13.9, 13.4, 9.6, and 7.0, respectively. Except for some blood groups, such as ABO and Lewis, for which it was difficult to predict the alleles using only WGS data, most alleles were successfully predicted in most blood groups. A comparison of allele frequencies showed no significant differences compared to the KRBP data, but there were differences compared to the Erythrogene data for the Lutheran, Kell, Duffy, Yt, Scianna, Landsteiner-Wiener, and Cromer blood group systems. Numerous minor blood group systems that were not available in the KRBP data were also included in this study. Conclusions We successfully established and performed blood group analysis using Korean public WGS data. It is expected that blood group analysis using WGS data will be performed more frequently in the future and will contribute to domestic data on blood group allele frequency and eventually the supply of safe blood products."
https://openalex.org/W4281852402,"Targeted bisulfite sequencing (TBS) has become the method of choice for the cost-effective, targeted analysis of the human methylome at base-pair resolution. In this study, we benchmarked five commercially available TBS platforms—three hybridization capture-based (Agilent, Roche and Illumina) and two reduced-representation-based (Diagenode and NuGen)—across 11 samples. Two samples were also compared with whole-genome DNA methylation sequencing with the Illumina and Oxford Nanopore platforms. We assessed workflow complexity, on/off-target performance, coverage, accuracy and reproducibility. Although all platforms produced robust and reproducible data, major differences in the number and identity of the CpG sites covered make it difficult to compare datasets generated on different platforms. To overcome this limitation, we applied imputation and show that it improves interoperability from an average of 10.35% (0.8 million) to 97% (7.6 million) common CpG sites. Our study provides guidance on which TBS platform to use for different methylome features and offers an imputation-based harmonization solution that allows comparative, integrative analysis. Differences in CpG coverage of targeted bisulfite sequencing methods can be overcome using imputation."
https://openalex.org/W4281871452,"Longitudinal clinical studies traditionally require in-person study visits which are well documented to pose barriers to participation and contribute challenges to enrolling representative samples. Remote trial models may reduce barriers to research engagement, improve retention, and reach a more representative cohort. As remote trials become more common following the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical evaluation of this approach is imperative to optimize this paradigm shift in research. The TestBoston study was launched to understand prevalence and risk factors for COVID-19 infection in the greater Boston area through a fully remote home-testing model. Participants (adults, within 45 miles of Boston, MA) were recruited remotely from patient registries at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the general public. Participants were provided with monthly and ""on-demand"" at-home SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and antibody testing using nasal swab and dried blood spot self-collection kits and electronic surveys to assess symptoms and risk factors for COVID-19 via an online dashboard. Between October 2020 and January 2021, we enrolled 10,289 participants reflective of Massachusetts census data. Mean age was 47 years (range 18-93), 5855 (56.9%) were assigned female sex at birth, 7181(69.8%) reported being White non-Hispanic, 952 (9.3%) Hispanic/Latinx, 925 (9.0%) Black, 889 (8.6%) Asian, and 342 (3.3%) other and/or more than one race. Lower initial enrollment among Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals required an adaptive approach to recruitment, leveraging connections to the medical system, coupled with community partnerships to ensure a representative cohort. Longitudinal retention was higher among participants who were White non-Hispanic, older, working remotely, and with lower socioeconomic vulnerability. Implementation highlighted key differences in remote trial models as participants independently navigate study milestones, requiring a dedicated participant support team and robust technology platforms, to reduce barriers to enrollment, promote retention, and ensure scientific rigor and data quality. Remote clinical trial models offer tremendous potential to engage representative cohorts, scale biomedical research, and promote accessibility by reducing barriers common in traditional trial design. Barriers and burdens within remote trials may be experienced disproportionately across demographic groups. To maximize engagement and retention, researchers should prioritize intensive participant support, investment in technologic infrastructure and an adaptive approach to maximize engagement and retention."
https://openalex.org/W4281912930,"The current global COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a public health crisis with more than 168 million cases reported globally and more than 4.5 million deaths at the time of writing. In addition to the direct impact of the disease, the economic impact has been significant as public health measures to contain or reduce the spread have led to country wide lockdowns resulting in near closure of many sectors of the economy. Antibodies are a principal determinant of the humoral immune response to COVID-19 infections and may have the potential to reduce disease and spread of the virus. The development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represents a therapeutic option that can be produced at large quantity and high quality. In the present study, a mAb combination mixture therapy was investigated for its capability to specifically neutralize SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that each of the antibodies bind the spike protein and neutralize the virus, preventing it from infecting cells in an in vitro cell-based assay, including multiple viral variants that are currently circulating in the human population. In addition, we investigated the effects of two different mutations in the Fc portion (YTE and LALA) of the antibody on Fc effector function and the ability to alleviate potential antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. These data demonstrate the potential of a combination of two mAbs that target two different epitopes on the SARS-CoV2 spike protein to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans while extending serum half-life and preventing antibody-dependent enhancement of disease."
https://openalex.org/W4281920295,"Automatic estimation of the poses of dairy cows over a long period can provide relevant information regarding their status and well-being in precision farming. Due to appearance similarity, cow pose estimation is challenging. To monitor the health of dairy cows in actual farm environments, a multicow pose estimation algorithm was proposed in this study. First, a monitoring system was established at a dairy cow breeding site, and 175 surveillance videos of 10 different cows were used as raw data to construct object detection and pose estimation data sets. To achieve the detection of multiple cows, the You Only Look Once (YOLO)v4 model based on CSPDarkNet53 was built and fine-tuned to output the bounding box for further pose estimation. On the test set of 400 images including single and multiple cows throughout the whole day, the average precision (AP) reached 94.58%. Second, the keypoint heatmaps and part affinity field (PAF) were extracted to match the keypoints of the same cow based on the real-time multiperson 2D pose detection model. To verify the performance of the algorithm, 200 single-object images and 200 dual-object images with occlusions were tested under different light conditions. The test results showed that the AP of leg keypoints was the highest, reaching 91.6%, regardless of day or night and single cows or double cows. This was followed by the AP values of the back, neck and head, sequentially. The AP of single cow pose estimation was 85% during the day and 78.1% at night, compared to double cows with occlusion, for which the values were 74.3% and 71.6%, respectively. The keypoint detection rate decreased when the occlusion was severe. However, in actual cow breeding sites, cows are seldom strongly occluded. Finally, a pose classification network was built to estimate the three typical poses (standing, walking and lying) of cows based on the extracted cow skeleton in the bounding box, achieving precision of 91.67%, 92.97% and 99.23%, respectively. The results showed that the algorithm proposed in this study exhibited a relatively high detection rate. Therefore, the proposed method can provide a theoretical reference for animal pose estimation in large-scale precision livestock farming."

Around 250 million children of age below five years in low-and middle- income countries (LMICs) are at risk of not attaining their developmental potential. A cross-sectional case study was conducted to assess the early childhood developmental (ECD) status and to investigate the factors influencing the same in Malda, India.Information on 731 pre-school children aged 36 to 59 months was collected in 2018 using a structured questionnaire following a multi-stage, stratified simple random sampling procedure. ECD was measured following the UNICEF's Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, which monitors early child development in LMICs. A path analysis using structural equation modelling was carried out to examine the relationship between possible associated factors and ECD status.It has been found that only about 25% of children are developmentally on track of literacy-numeracy domain of ECD. Although, in the other domains, the situation is better. Results of the path analysis revealed that there are certain proximal factors, i.e., home environment, mother's time for care, having home tuition and attending private pre-school, which are influenced by certain distal factors and subsequently affecting ECD. The total effects revealed that place of residence (urban or rural) affects ECD mostly (Coef. -0.87, p = <0.001) directly or via mothers' time for stimulating activities, home environment and having home tuition for children. Further, it revealed that private pre-schools (Coef. 0.76, p = <0.001) and home tuition (Coef. 0.43, p = <0.001) also play a significant role in ECD.Urgent attention from policymakers or other stakeholders is needed to promote ECD for the betterment of children and society of Malda district. In addition to that, special attention needs to be given to the children who belong to Muslim families, socially deprived communities and living in rural areas."

Previous studies in animal models have reported an association between serum levels of vitamin D and balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. There is insufficient evidence about the effect of vitamin D on mediators of angiogenesis in patients with CKD. We investigated the effect of cholecalciferol supplementation on serum levels of angiogenic markers in non-diabetic patients with CKD stage 3-4. In this secondary analysis on stored samples of our previously published randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, stable patients of either sex, aged 18-70 years, with non-diabetic CKD stage 3-4 and vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ≤20 ng/ml) were randomized to receive either two directly observed oral doses of cholecalciferol (300,000 IU) or matching placebo at baseline and 8 weeks. The primary outcome was change in brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation at 16 weeks. Changes in levels of serum angiogenesis markers (angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, VEGF-A, VEGEF-R, and Tie-2) between groups over 16 weeks were compared. A total 120 patients were enrolled. Supplementation with cholecalciferol led to significant improvement in FMD. Serum 25(OH)D levels were similar in both groups at baseline (13.21±4.78 ng/ml and 13.40±4.42 ng/ml; p = 0.888). At 16 weeks, the serum 25(OH)D levels increased in the cholecalciferol group but not in the placebo group (between-group difference in mean change:23.40 ng/ml; 95% CI, 19.76 to 27.06; p<0.001). Serum levels of angiogenic markers were similar at baseline. At 16 weeks, angiopoietin-2 level decreased in cholecalciferol group (mean difference:-0.73 ng/ml, 95%CI, -1.25 to -0.20, p = 0.002) but not in placebo group (mean difference -0.46 ng/ml, 95%CI, -1.09 to 0.17, p = 0.154), however there was no between-group difference at 16 weeks (between-group difference in mean change: -0.27 ng/ml, 95%CI, -1.09 to 0.55, p = 0.624). Serum angiopoietin-1 level increased [mean change: 5.63 (0.51 to 10.75), p = 0.018] and VEGF-R level decreased [mean change: -87.16 (-131.89 to -42.44), p<0.001] in placebo group but did not show any change in cholecalciferol group. Our data shows the changes in Ang-1, Ang-2 and Ang-1/Ang-2 ratio after high dose oral cholecalciferol supplementation in patients with non-diabetic G3-4 CKD. The data suggests changes in circulating levels of angiogenic markers which needs to be confirmed through an adequately powered study."

The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopaedic and trauma healthcare at the largest university hospital in the Czech Republic. The evaluated periods were in accordance with three waves of the disease and three respective lockdowns. To correlate the results, we evaluated the number of patients (inpatients and outpatients) treated in the same period in the last 3 years before the pandemic. The number of orthopaedic outpatients during the lockdown period decreased by 54.12% (p = 0.002), 42.88% (p <0.001), and 34.53% (p = 0.03) in the first, second, and third lockdowns, respectively. The number of elective surgeries decreased by 69.01% (p <0.001), 87.57% (p <0.001), and 74.89% (p = 0.007) and the number of acute surgeries decreased by 33.15% (p = 0.002), 37.46% (p <0.001), and 27.24% (p = 0.034) in the first, second, and third lockdowns, respectively. This study showed a significant reduction in the healthcare of orthopaedic and trauma patients owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasised the shortcomings of the healthcare system. In our study, there was a reduction in both outpatient (reduction of care by 24-54%) and inpatient care. The elective surgeries were reduced by 69-87% during different lockdown periods compared with the reference period. Based on the results of this study, we can formulate organisational measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on orthopaedic healthcare. Organisational procedures created based on acquired data and experience should maximise the bed capacity of the workplace and work efficiency with regard to the safety of medical staff."

Although International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) put research as one of the midwifery competencies and professional development activity, clinical midwives are poorly involved in research. Therefore, this study is aimed to assess clinical midwives engagement in research and bridge the gap through applicable strategies.Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among clinical midwives working at public health facilities of Central and North Gondar Zone, Ethiopia from September to October, 2020 G.C. A structured and pre-tested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data and entered into Epi-info version 7. Descriptive statistics was used to describe study population. Bi-variable and multi-variable logistic regression analysis was performed using STATA Version 14 and significance level declared at 95% confidence interval, p-value ≤ 0.05 and respective odds ratios.Out of 335 clinical midwives, 314 were participated making the response rate 93.7%. Among the midwives, one hundred seventy two (54.8%) (95% CI: 49.08%, 60.37) have good skill on conducting a research. Clinical midwives with mothers with formal education [AOR: 1.90, 95% CI: (1.03, 3.51), currently work on referral hospitals [AOR: 2.33, 95% CI: (1.19, 4.53)] and having good level of knowledge on research [AOR: 2.19, 95% CI: (1.25, 3.82)] have significant association with having good research skill. Forty eight (15.2%) (95% CI: 11.5%, 19.7%) ever participated in research during their clinical practice. Clinical midwives who have good knowledge on research [AOR: 0.31, 95% CI: (0.14, 0.70)] are about 0.3 times less likely to participate on research than who have poor knowledge [AOR: 0.31, 95% CI: (0.14, 0.70)].Although more than half have good research skill, only a small proportion of midwives were involved in research.

Our research examine who shared climate change research papers on Twitter by looking at the expressions used in profile descriptions. We categorized users in eight categories (academia, communication, political, professional, personal, organization, bots and publishers) associated to specific expressions. Results indicate how diverse publics may be represented in the communication of scholarly documents on Twitter. Supplementing our word detection analysis with qualitative assessments of the results, we highlight how the presence of unique or multiple categorizations in textual Twitter descriptions provides evidence of the publics of research in specific contexts. Our results show a more substantial communication by academics and organizations for papers published in 2016, whereas the general public comparatively participated more in 2015. Overall, there is significant participation of publics outside of academia in the communication of climate change research articles on Twitter, although the extent to which these publics participate varies between individual papers. This means that papers circulate in specific communities which need to be assessed to understand the reach of research on social media. Furthermore, the flexibility of our method provide means for research assessment that consider the contextuality and plurality of publics involved on Twitter."
https://openalex.org/W4281842487,"Histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) is aberrantly expressed in many types of cancer, and such abnormalities are associated with tumor immunity and heterogeneous clinical outcomes. Here, we explore the prognostic value and immunological function of HDAC11 across 33 cancer types. We observe HDAC11 is aberrantly expressed in 25 cancer types and positively or negatively associated with prognosis in different cancers. HDAC11 played a protective prognostic role in KIRP, KIRC, LGG, PCPG, READ, and UVM, which was contrary to the conventional opinion that HDAC11 was an oncogenic gene. Moreover, HDAC11 is negatively associated with tumor immune components, most immune checkpoint genes, and key cytokine expression. HDAC11 is correlated with tumor mutational burden in 11 cancer types and with microsatellite instability in 9 cancer types, suggesting HDAC11 may affect a patient's response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. In addition, HDAC11 is negatively correlated with the drug sensitivity of oxaliplatin, carmustine, ifosfamide, imexon, lomustine, and BN-2629, indicating the potential synergy between HDAC11 inhibitors and these anti-tumor drugs. In vitro assays indicate that HDAC11 inhibitor SIS17 combined with oxaliplatin shows a synergistic cytotoxic role in K562 cells while SIS17 has an antagonistic effect on the cytotoxic role of oxaliplatin in 769P cells. HDAC11 is also associated with hallmark pathways, including epithelial mesenchymal transition, IL-6/JAK/STAT3, and allograft rejection pathways. Overall, we provide clues regarding the key role of HDAC11 in multiple cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4281922034,"Salvia officinalis is one of the most important medicinal and aromatic plants in terms of nutritional and medicinal value because it contains a variety of vital active ingredients. Terpenoid compounds, particularly monoterpenes (C10) and sesquiterpenes, are the most important and abundant among these active substances (C15). Terpenes play a variety of roles and have beneficial biological properties in plants. With these considerations, the current study sought to clone theNAD+-dependent farnesol dehydrogenase (SoFLDH, EC: 1.1.1.354) gene from S. officinalis. Functional analysis revealed that, SoFLDH has an open reading frame of 2,580 base pairs that encodes 860 amino acids.SoFLDH has two conserved domains and four types of highly conserved motifs: YxxxK, RXR, RR (X8) W, TGxxGhaG. However, SoFLDH was cloned from Salvia officinalis leaves and functionally overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate its role in sesquiterpenoid synthases. In comparison to the transgenic plants, the wild-type plants showed a slight delay in growth and flowering formation. To this end, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that SoFLDH transgenic plants were responsible for numerous forms of terpene synthesis, particularly sesquiterpene. These results provide a base for further investigation on SoFLDH gene role and elucidating the regulatory mechanisms for sesquiterpene synthesis in S. offcinalis. And our study paves the way for the future metabolic engineering of the biosynthesis of useful terpene compounds in S. offcinalis."
https://openalex.org/W4282005490,"Abnormal heart rhythm is a common cardiac dysfunction in obese patients, and its pathogenesis is related to systemic lipid accumulation. The cardiomyocyte-derived apoLpp (homologous gene in Drosophila of the human apolipoprotein B) plays an important role in whole-body lipid metabolism of Drosophila under a high-fat diet (HFD). Knockdown of apoLpp derived from cardiomyocytes can reduce HFD-induced weight gain and abdominal lipid accumulation. In addition, exercise can reduce the total amount of apoLpp in circulation. However, the relationship between regular exercise, cardiomyocyte-derived apoLpp and abnormal heart rhythm is unclear. We found that an HFD increased the level of triglyceride (TG) in the whole-body, lipid accumulation and obesity in Drosophila. Moreover, the expression of apoLpp in the heart increased sharply, the heart rate and arrhythmia index increased and fibrillation occurred. Conversely, regular exercise or cardiomyocyte-derived apoLpp knockdown reduced the TG level in the whole-body of Drosophila. This significantly reduced the arrhythmia induced by obesity, including the reduction of heart rate, arrhythmia index, and fibrillation. Under HFD conditions, flies with apoLpp knockdown in the heart could resist the abnormal cardiac rhythm caused by obesity after receiving regular exercise. HFD-induced obesity and abnormal cardiac rhythm may be related to the acute increase of cardiomyocyte-derived apoLpp. Regular exercise and inhibition of cardiomyocyte-derived apoLpp can reduce the HFD-induced abnormal cardiac rhythm."

https://openalex.org/W4282043818,"The arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif is a cell adhesion sequence that binds to integrins. Some RGD-containing peptides promote adhesion of both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); however, not all such RGD-containing peptides are active. In this study, we elucidated the role of RGD-neighboring sequences on iPSC adhesion using diverse synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins. Our results indicate that iPSC adhesion requires RGDX1 X2 sequences, such as RGDVF and RGDNY, and that the X1 X2 residues are essential for the adhesion via integrin αvβ5 but not αvβ3. iPSCs express integrin αvβ5 but not αvβ3; therefore, iPSC adhesion requires the RGDX1 X2 -containing sequences. The importance of the X1 X2 residues was confirmed with both HeLa and A549 cells, which express integrin αvβ5 but not αvβ3. Analysis of RGD-neighboring sequences provides important insights into ligand-binding specificity of integrins. Identification of integrin αvβ5-binding motifs is potentially useful in drug development, drug delivery, cell culture, and tissue engineering."

Simulating three rainfall intensities of 2 mm/h (light rain), 6 mm/h (moderate rain) and 10 mm/h (heavy rain) at different interval times (0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h) to analyze variable regulation of the control effect, the photosynthetic pigment content and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of C. album after spraying mesotrione. With the extension of rainfall time interval, the inhibition rate of plant height, plant control effect and fresh weight control effect of C. album were gradually increased, the inhibition effect of rainfall on the efficacy was gradually decreased, at the same time, the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, the maximum photochemical quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm), the actual photochemical quantum yield (Y (II)) and quantum yield (Y (NO)) production of regular energy consumption of C. album were also increased, while the nonregulatory energy decreased gradually. The results showed that the contents of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b in leaves of C. album increased significantly by 35.63% and 35.38% compared with the control under the condition of simulating 6 mm/h in interval 1 hour. The study suggested that simulating 10 mm/h rainfall intensity had the greatest effect on C. album, the photosynthetic pigment content, Fv/Fm and Y (II) of leaves were significantly higher than those in the control groups under 0.5 h, 1 h and 2 h interval treatments. The carotenoid content was the lowest and Y (NO) was the largest under the 4 h interval treatment. As is displayed that rainfall reduced the weed control effect in the aspect of controlling C. album on mesotrione, which is partly contributed to increase photosynthetic pigment content and enhance the PS II photochemical activity. In conclusion, the rain intensity of ≤2 mm/h did not affect the control effect of mesotrione on C. album. At 6 mm/h within 1 h after treatment, the control effect of fresh weight was significantly reduced by more than 7.14%, and at 10 mm/h within 2 h, the control effect was significantly reduced by more than 14.78%."
https://openalex.org/W4281654566,"Purpose To identify the effects of prolonged type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on the retinal microvasculature of each retinal capillary plexus in patients without clinical diabetic retinopathy (DR). Methods Subjects were divided into three groups: the control group (98 eyes), patients with T2DM &lt; 10 years (DM group 1, 84 eyes), and patients with T2DM ≥ 10 years (DM group 2, 55 eyes). The vessel densities (VD) of the superficial and deep capillary plexus (SCP and DCP) were compared. Linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with the VD. Results The mean VDs of the SCP in the control group, DM group 1, and DM group 2 were 35.9 ± 4.2, 34.9 ± 3.9, and 34.6 ± 5.1, respectively ( P = 0.042). The mean VDs of the DCP in the three groups were 36.1 ± 3.1, 35.9 ± 3.0, and 34.0 ± 3.3, respectively ( P &lt; 0.001). In multivariate analyses, the BCVA was a significant factor associated with both the superficial VD (B = −7.10, P = 0.019) and deep VD (B = −5.70, P = 0.039). Hypertension (B = −1.22, P = 0.021) and DM duration (B = −0.20, P &lt; 0.001) were significant factors associated with deep VD. Conclusions T2DM patients without DR showed decreased VD in the SCP and DCP. The microvascular impairment of the DCP in patients with T2DM ≥ 10 years was in particular, more severe. Additionally, ischemia caused by hypertension and accumulated impairment of microvasculature due to prolonged T2DM would affect the DCP."

The head blight fungus, Fusarium graminearum , causes destructive losses of economically important cereal crops. The recent development of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for use with F . graminearum has enabled more efficient genome editing. In this study, we described a CRISPR-Cas9-based genome-editing tool for the direct delivery of preassembled Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into the protoplasts of F . graminearum . The use of RNPs significantly increased both the number of transformants and percentage of transformants in which the target gene was successfully replaced with a selectable marker. We showed that a single double-strand DNA break mediated by the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein was sufficient for gene deletion. In addition, short-homology recombination required only 50 base pair regions flanking the target gene. The high efficiency of Cas9 RNPs enables large-scale functional analysis, the identification of essential genes, and gene deletion that is difficult with conventional methods. We expect that our approach will accelerate genetic studies of F . graminearum ."

Given the limited data from adolescent populations, the primary objective of this study was to examine the responsiveness of a single item measure (SIM) of PA for adolescents to detect change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) using accelerometer data as the reference measure. A secondary objective was to provide further data on the validity of the measure at one point in time. The validity of the SIM to determine the number of days ≥60 minutes of MVPA was based on data from 200 participants (62% female; age: 14.0 ± 1.6 years) and analysis of change was based on data from 177 participants (65% female; age: 14.0 ± 1.6 years). Validity of change in days ≥60 minutes of MVPA was examined through agreement in classification of change between the SIM and accelerometry as the reference measurement and Spearman's correlation. Cohen's d and standardised response means were used to assess the responsiveness to change of the measure. The responsiveness of the SIM and accelerometer data were comparable and modest (0.27-0.38). The correlation for change in number of days ≥60 minutes MVPA between the SIM and accelerometery was low (r = 0.11) and the accuracy of the SIM for detecting change, using accelerometry as the reference, was only marginally above chance (53%). Therefore, the adolescent version of the SIM is adequate for assessing PA at a single time point but not recommended for assessing change."

In the present study, we investigated the sequence of sucrose binding protein (SBP) as a seed-specific promoter to find the cis -acting elements specific to gene expression in seeds. The 1860 bp SBP sequence was analyzed using Plant Care and PLACE databases to find cis -acting elements, which resulted in a finding of 22 cis -acting elements required for seed expression. In addition, we have discovered cis - acting elements that are indirectly involved in triacylglycerol synthesis (GATABOX, DOFCOREZM, CACGTGMOTIF). The seed specificity of SBP was analyzed by generating a stable transgenic tobacco plant harboring β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under the control of the SBP promoter. Histochemical analysis of these transgenic tobacco plants indicated decreasing GUS activity in the leaves during the vegetative stage. However, the mature seeds of transgenic plants showed GUS activity. Moreover, the SBP promoter function in the seed oil content was evaluated by the expression of DGAT1 . The expression analysis of DGAT1 in SBP-DGAT1 transgenic tobacco seeds using quantitative real-time PCR revealed a 7.8-fold increase in DGAT1 than in non-transgenic plants. Moreover, oil content increased up to 2.19 times more than in non-transgenic plants. And the oil content of the SBP-DGAT1 transgenic tobacco leaves did not change compared to the control plant. Therefore, we suggested that the SBP promoter could be used as a seed-specific promoter for targeted expression of desired genes in the metabolite engineering of oilseed crops."
https://openalex.org/W4281689445,"This study evaluates the association of anthropometric indexes and the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after a 5-year follow-up.

As expected, the participants who developed T2DM after five years (3.8%) had the worst metabolic profile with higher hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity rates. Besides, using mixed-effects logistic regression and adjustment for sex, age, and glucose, we found that one unit increase in body adiposity index (BAI) was associated with an 8% increase in their risk of developing T2DM (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08 [95% CI, 1.02–1.14]) and visceral adiposity index (VAI) was associated with a risk increase of 11% (OR = 1.11 [95% CI, 1.00–1.22]). Moreover, a one-unit increase in the triglycerides-glucose index (TyG) was associated with more than four times the risk of developing T2DM (OR = 4.27 [95% CI, 1.01–17.97]). The interquartile range odds ratio for the continuous predictors showed that TyG had the best discriminating performance. However, when any of them were additionally adjusted for waist circumference (WC) or even body mass index (BMI), all adiposity indexes lost the effect in predicting T2DM. In conclusion, TyG had the most substantial predictive power among all three indexes. However, neither BAI, VAI, nor TyG were superior to WC or BMI for predicting the risk of developing T2DM in a middle-aged normoglycemic sample in this rural Brazilian population."

It can potentially compensate for the negative health influences of low socioeconomic status (SES), rewarding this unwanted behavior. This study aimed to investigate the role of bullying perpetration in the relationship between SES and health among Armenian adolescents. A nationally representative sample of 3679 adolescents aged 11-15 years (mean = 13.1, standard deviation = 1.6) participated in the Health Behavior in School-aged Children 2013/14 survey in Armenia. Complex samples multiple logistic regression were used to estimate the associations between two SES measures (family socioeconomic position [SEP] and material well-being) and three health outcomes (perceived health status, psychosocial well-being, and psychosomatic symptoms). Bullying perpetration was not associated with less than good health or low psychosocial well-being (P > 0.05) but increased the odds of reporting high psychosomatic symptoms (P < 0.05). Perpetration did not change the SES-health gradient substantially. However, in stratified analyses, socioeconomic inequalities in health were consistently weaker among perpetrators. The largest observed difference was in the relationship between low family SEP and less than good health (OR = 3.60, 95% CI = 2.77-4.67 vs. OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.06-3.04), whereas the smallest difference was in the relationship between low family SEP and high psychosomatic symptoms (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.03-1.56 vs. OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.61-1.77). Our findings suggest that bullying perpetration, as an alternative hierarchy, may be looked at as a compensatory but vicious strategy in the face of the negative health influences of low SES in Armenian adolescents. For high-SES adolescents, on the other hand, social, emotional, or psychological problems might contribute to bullying perpetration. Consequently, bullying prevention activities in Armenia should focus on both low and high-SES adolescents, considering SES-specific pathways and mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4281778623,"Wind energy is a growing source of renewable energy with a 3-fold increase in use globally over the last decade. However, wind turbines cause bat mortality, especially for migratory species. The southwest United States has high bat species diversity and is an important area for migratory species, although little is known about their seasonal distribution. To examine potential risk to bats in areas proposed for wind energy development, we characterized bat occupancy spatially and temporally across northern Arizona, identifying use during summer when bats are reproductively active and fall during the migratory season. Our objectives were to determine occupancy of migratory species and species of greatest conservation need and develop a probability of occupancy map for species to identify areas of potential conflict with wind energy development. We selected 92 sites in 10 clusters with potential for development and used acoustic detectors to sample bats in the summer and fall of 2016 and 2017 for 6 nights per site per year. We predicted response of migratory bat species and species of special concern to 9 landscape variables using Program MARK. During summer, higher densities of forest on the landscape resulted in a higher probability of occupancy of migratory species such as hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans), big free-tailed bats (Nyctinomops macrotis), and species of conservation need such as spotted bats (Euderma maculatum). During the fall, higher concentration of valleys on the landscape predicted occupancy of hoary bats, big free-tailed bats, and spotted bats. High bat occupancy in the fall was also associated with higher elevation and close proximity to forests. We recommend that wind turbines be placed in open, flat grasslands away from forested landscapes and concentrations of valleys or other topographic variation."
https://openalex.org/W4281920284,"Comprehensive regular foot self-care is one of the most critical self-management behaviors for people with diabetes to prevent foot ulcer development and related complications. Yet, adequate foot self-care is only practiced by very few of those affected. To improve diabetic foot syndrome prevention, a valid and reliable instrument for measuring daily foot-care routines in patients with diabetes is needed. However, no such instrument is currently available in the German language. This study, therefore, aims to translate and cross-culturally adapt the ""Diabetic Foot Self-Care Behavior Scale"" (DFSBS) into German (DFSBS-D) and evaluate its validity and reliability.The DFSBS was translated from English into German using a forward-backward procedure as per previous recommendations. Factor analysis was used to study structural validity. To establish construct validity, 21 a priori hypotheses were defined regarding the expected correlation between scores on the new German version (i.e., DFSBS-D) and those of the following questionnaires measuring related constructs: (1) German version ""Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure"" (SDSCA-G), (2) ""Frankfurter Catalogue of Foot Self-Care"" (FCFSP), and (3) ""Short Form 36"" (SF-36) and tested in 82 patients. To assess test-retest reliability, patients completed the DFSBS-D again after a 2-week interval. Test-retest reliability was assessed from stable patients' data (n = 48) by calculating two-way random-effects absolute agreement ICCs with 95% CI and Bland and Altman analyses. In addition, Cronbach's alpha was calculated as internal consistency measure.The 7-item DFSBS-D showed good structural validity. Its single factor explains 57% of the total sample variance. Of the 21 predefined hypotheses, 13 (62%) were confirmed. The DFSBS-D's internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.87). Test-retest reliability over a 2-week interval was also good (ICC 0.76).The DFSBS was successfully translated into German. Statistical analyses showed good DFSBS-D structural validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency. Yet, construct validity may be debated."
https://openalex.org/W4281989502,"A service can be an intangible commodity in which no physical goods are transferred from the seller to the buyer. However, traditional trading platforms have many limitations in trading services due to dishonest buyers and brokers. In this paper, we propose a service trading ecosystem based on blockchain, named STEB, which combines blockchain, smart contract, encryption, and digital authentication techniques for service trading. In addition, a dual-chain architecture, which contains two types of blockchains, namely TraChain and SerChain, and a hierarchical encryption scheme of the data on the chain, are proposed to ensure the integrity of transaction data and fine-grained privacy protection of users. Furthermore, we describe a new set of smart contracts to ensure safe transactions for the entire service trading. Security analysis and simulation results confirm that the proposed STEB can achieve more efficient contract execution and enhance service transaction privacy."

Data was obtained using a questionnaire and included information on demographics, ocular and medical history, family history of AMD, lifestyle, and smoking and drinking habits. Genetic evaluations included direct sequencing for the LOC387715 (rs10490924) variant, as well as PCR and enzymatic digestion for the CFH Y402H (rs1061170) and HTRA1 (rs11200638) variants. We performed a risk assessment of environmental risk factors and genetic variants associated with AMD and determined correlations between AMD and the data collected using multiple linear regression analysis.Of the 141 AMD cases, 99 (70%) had advanced AMD in at least one eye (57% neovascular AMD and 13% geographic atrophy), and 42 (30%) had not-advanced AMD. Family history of AMD (OR: 6.58; 95% CI: 1.94-22.31), presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (OR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.08-5.28), low physical activity level (OR: 1.39; 95% CI: 0.82-2.37), and high serum cholesterol (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 0.84-2.65) were associated with an increased risk for AMD. There was a significant association between CVD and incidence of advanced AMD (OR: 2.29; 95% CI 0.81-6.44). The OR for the risk allele of the LOC387715 gene, the CFH gene and the HTRA1 gene were 2.21 (95% CI: 1.47-3.35), 2.27 (95% CI: 1.52-3.37), and 2.76 (95% CI: 1.89-4.03), respectively. In the stepwise multiple linear regression analyses, the HTRA1 and CFH risk alleles, family history of AMD, the LOC387715 risk allele, and CVD were associated with an increased risk of AMD for a total of 25.6% contribution to the AMD phenotype.The analysis correlating environmental and genetic risk factors such as family history of AMD, and CVD and the variants of HTRA1, CFH, and LOC387715 genes showed an expressive contribution for the development of AMD among this admixed population."
https://openalex.org/W4281668001,"The magnitude of subsidies provided to the fishing sector by governments worldwide is immense-an estimated $35.4 billion USD per year. The majority of these subsidies may be impeding efforts to sustainably manage fisheries by incentivizing overfishing and overcapacity. Recognizing the threat these subsidies pose, the World Trade Organization has set a goal of reaching an agreement that would end fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity, overfishing, and illegal fishing. However, negotiations have been hampered by uncertainty around the likely effects of reforming these subsidies. Here we present a novel method for translating a bioeconomic model into an interactive online decision support tool that draws upon real-world data on fisheries subsidies and industrial fishing activity so users can directly compare the relative ambition levels of different subsidy reform options."
https://openalex.org/W4281689492,"Marital status has been proposed as a promising prognostic factor in many malignancies, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its prognostic value is still unclear for individual non-surgical treatments for stage I NSCLC. This study investigated the prognostic value of marital status in patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with SBRT between January 2003 and March 2014 at our institute were enrolled, and marital status at the time of SBRT was investigated. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to reduce potential selection bias between the married and unmarried groups. Two hundred and forty patients (median age 77 years; 152 married, 87 unmarried) were analyzed. The unmarried included higher proportions of the elderly, women, never smokers, and those with decreased pulmonary function compared to the married. PSM identified 53 matched pairs of married and unmarried patients, with no significant difference in patient background parameters. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 52.8% and 46.9% in the married and unmarried groups, respectively ( P = 0.26). There was no significant difference in NSCLC death or non-NSCLC death between the two groups ( P = 0.88 and 0.30, respectively). There was no significant difference in OS between married and unmarried male patients (n = 85, 5-year OS, 52.6% vs. 46.0%; P = 0.42) and between married and unmarried female patients (n = 21, 54.5% vs. 50.0%; P = 0.44). In conclusion, marital status was not associated with OS in patients receiving SBRT for early-stage NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W4281755601,"The quality of urban public spaces affects the emotional response of users; therefore, the emotional data of users can be used as indices to evaluate the quality of a space. Emotional response can be evaluated to effectively measure public space quality through affective computing and obtain evidence-based support for urban space renewal. We proposed a feasible evaluation method for multi-type urban public spaces based on multiple physiological signals and ensemble learning. We built binary, ternary, and quinary classification models based on participants’ physiological signals and self-reported emotional responses through experiments in eight public spaces of five types. Furthermore, we verified the effectiveness of the model by inputting data collected from two other public spaces. Three observations were made based on the results. First, the highest accuracies of the binary and ternary classification models were 92.59% and 91.07%, respectively. After external validation, the highest accuracies were 80.90% and 65.30%, respectively, which satisfied the preliminary requirements for evaluating the quality of actual urban spaces. However, the quinary classification model could not satisfy the preliminary requirements. Second, the average accuracy of ensemble learning was 7.59% higher than that of single classifiers. Third, reducing the number of physiological signal features and applying the synthetic minority oversampling technique to solve unbalanced data improved the evaluation ability."
https://openalex.org/W4281765820,"Ship target detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is an important application field. Due to the existence of sea clutter, especially the SAR imaging in huge wave area, SAR images contain a lot of complex noise, which brings great challenges to the effective detection of ship targets in SAR images. Although the deep semantic segmentation network has been widely used in the detection of ship targets in recent years, the global information of the image cannot be fully utilized. To solve this problem, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) method based on wavelet and attention mechanism was proposed in this paper, called the WA-CNN algorithm. The new method uses the U-Net structure to construct the network, which not only effectively reduces the depth of the network structure, but also significantly improves the complexity of the network. The basic network of WA-CNN algorithm consists of encoder and decoder. Dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) is introduced into the pooling layer of the encoder to smooth the speckle noise in SAR images, which is beneficial to preserve the contour structure and detail information of the target in the feature image. The attention mechanism theory is added into the decoder to obtain the global information of the ship target. Two public SAR image datasets were used to verify the proposed method, and good experimental results were obtained. This shows that the method proposed in this article is effective and feasible."
https://openalex.org/W4281975169,"Most natural ecosystems contain animals feeding on many different types of food, but it is difficult to predict what will be eaten when food availabilities change. We present a method that estimates food preference over many study sites, even when number of food types vary widely from site to site. Sampling variation is estimated using bootstrapping. We test the precision and accuracy of this method using computer simulations that show the effects of overall number of food types, number of sites, and proportion of missing prey items per site. Accuracy is greater with fewer missing prey types, more prey types and more sites, and is affected by the number of sites more than the number of prey types. We present a case study using lion (Panthera leo) feeding data and show that preference vs prey size follows a bell-curve. Using just two estimated parameters, this curve can be used as a general way to describe predator feeding patterns. Our method can be used to: test hypotheses about what factors affect prey selection, predict preferences in new sites, and estimate overall prey consumed in new sites."
