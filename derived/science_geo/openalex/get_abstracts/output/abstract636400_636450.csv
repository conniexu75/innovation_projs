https://openalex.org/W2960351153,"Early growth response-1 (EGR1) is a transcription factor correlated with prostate cancer (PC) progression in a variety of contexts. For example, EGR1 levels increase in response to suppressed androgen receptor signaling or loss of the tumor suppressor, PTEN. EGR1 has been shown to regulate genes influencing proliferation, apoptosis, immune cell activation, and matrix degradation, among others. Despite this, the impact of EGR1 on PC metastatic colonization is unclear. We demonstrate using a PC model (DU145/RasB1) of bone and brain metastasis that EGR1 expression regulates angiogenic and osteoclastogenic properties of metastases. We have shown previously that FN14 (TNFRSF12A) and downstream NF-κB signaling is required for metastasis in this model. Here we demonstrate that FN14 ligation also leads to NF-κB-independent, MEK-dependent EGR1 expression. EGR1-depletion in DU145/RasB1 cells reduced both the number and size of metastases but did not affect primary tumor growth. Decreased EGR1 expression led to reduced blood vessel density in brain and bone metastases as well as decreased osteolytic bone lesion area and reduced numbers of osteoclasts at the bone–tumor interface. TWEAK (TNFSF12) induced several EGR1-dependent angiogenic and osteoclastogenic factors (e.g., PDGFA, TGFB1, SPP1, IL6, IL8, and TGFA, among others). Consistent with this, in clinical samples of PC, the level of several genes encoding angiogenic/osteoclastogenic pathway effectors correlated with EGR1 levels. Thus, we show here that EGR1 has a direct effect on prostate cancer metastases. EGR1 regulates angiogenic and osteoclastogenic factors, informing the underlying signaling networks that impact autonomous and microenvironmental mechanisms of cancer metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2960623898,"Missense mutations in the TP53 gene are frequent in human cancers, giving rise to mutant p53 proteins that can acquire oncogenic properties. Gain of function mutant p53 proteins can enhance tumour aggressiveness by promoting cell invasion, metastasis and chemoresistance. Accumulating evidences indicate that mutant p53 proteins can also modulate cell homeostatic processes, suggesting that missense p53 mutation may increase resistance of tumour cells to intrinsic and extrinsic cancer-related stress conditions, thus offering a selective advantage. Here we provide evidence that mutant p53 proteins can modulate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to increase cell survival upon Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress, a condition to which cancer cells are exposed during tumour formation and progression, as well as during therapy. Mechanistically, this action of mutant p53 is due to enhanced activation of the pro-survival UPR effector ATF6, coordinated with inhibition of the pro-apoptotic UPR effectors JNK and CHOP. In a triple-negative breast cancer cell model with missense TP53 mutation, we found that ATF6 activity is necessary for viability and invasion phenotypes. Together, these findings suggest that ATF6 inhibitors might be combined with mutant p53-targeting drugs to specifically sensitise cancer cells to endogenous or chemotherapy-induced ER stress."

We aimed to quantify the future health gain, health-sector cost-savings, and change in greenhouse gas emissions that could be achieved by switching short vehicle trips to walking and cycling in New Zealand.We used unit-level survey data to estimate changes in physical activity, distance travelled by mode, and air pollution for: (a) switching car trips under 1km to walking and (b) switching car trips under 5km to a mix of walking and cycling. We modelled uptake levels of 25%, 50%, and 100%, and assumed changes in transport behaviour were permanent. We then used multi-state life table modelling to quantify health impacts as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and changes in health system costs over the rest of the life course of the NZ population alive in 2011 (n = 4.4 million), with 3% discounting.The modelled scenarios resulted in health gains between 1.61 (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 1.35 to 1.89) and 25.43 (UI 20.20 to 30.58) QALYs/1000 people, with total QALYs up to 112,020 (UI 88,969 to 134,725) over the remaining lifespan. Healthcare cost savings ranged between NZ$127million (UI $101m to 157m) and NZ$2.1billion (UI $1.6b to 2.6b). Greenhouse gas emissions were reduced by up to 194kgCO2e/year, though changes in emissions were not significant under the walking scenario.Substantial health gains and healthcare cost savings could be achieved by switching short car trips to walking and cycling. Implementing infrastructural improvements and interventions to encourage walking and cycling is likely to be a cost-effective way to improve population health, and may also reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2961820827,"Oro-facial fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma;SSc) has a major impact on mouth function, facial appearance, and patient quality of life. Lipotransfer is a method of reconstruction that can be used in the treatment of oro-facial fibrosis. The effect of this treatment not only restores oro-facial volume but has also been found to reverse the effects of oro-facial fibrosis. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) within the engrafted adipose tissue have been shown to be anti-fibrotic in SSc and are proposed as the mechanism of the anti-fibrotic effect of lipotransfer. A cohort of 62 SSc patients with oro-facial fibrosis were assessed before and after stem cell enriched lipotransfer treatment. Clinical evaluation included assessment of mouth function using a validated assessment tool (Mouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis Scale-MHISS), validated psychological measurements and pre and post-operative volumetric assessment. In addition, to understand the mechanism by which the anti-fibrotic effect of ADSCs occur, SSc derived fibroblasts and ADSCs from this cohort of patients were co-cultured in direct and indirect culture systems and compared to monoculture controls. Cell viability, DNA content, protein secretion of known fibrotic mediators including growth factor- β1 (TGF β-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) using ELISA analysis and fibrosis gene expression using a fibrosis pathway specific qPCR array were evaluated. Mouth function (MHISS) was significantly improved (6.85±5.07) (p<0.0001) after treatment. All psychological measures were significantly improved: DAS 24 (12.1±9.5) (p<0.0001); HADS-anxiety (2.8±3.2) (p<0.0001), HADS-depression (2.0±3.1) (p<0.0001); BFNE (2.9 ± 4.3) (p<0.0001); VAS (3.56±4.1) (p<0.0001). Multiple treatments further improved mouth function (p<0.05), DAS (p<0.0001) and VAS (p = 0.01) scores. SSc fibroblast viability and proliferation was significantly reduced in co-culture compared to monoculture via a paracrine effect over 14 days (p < 0.0001). Protein secretion of transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was significantly reduced in co-culture compared to monoculture (p < 0.0001). Multiple fibrosis associated genes were down regulated in SSc co-culture compared to monoculture after 14 days including Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMMP-8), Platelet derived growth factor-β (PDGF-β) and Integrin Subunit Beta 6 (ITG-β6). Autologous stem cell enriched lipotransfer significantly improved the effects of oro-facial fibrosis in SSc in this open cohort study. Lipotransfer may reduce dermal fibrosis through the suppression of fibroblast proliferation and key regulators of fibrogenesis including TG-β1 and CTGF. Our findings warrant further investigation in a randomised controlled trial."
https://openalex.org/W2957088476,"Introduction In the United States, gonadectomy is common and widely promoted as a component of responsible pet ownership. The recent publication of several studies examining the effect of gonadectomy on future health has challenged long-held assumptions and recommendations for gonadectomy in companion animals. The purpose of this study was to characterize the associations between gonadectomy and two outcomes: overweight/obesity and orthopedic injuries, in a large prospective study of Golden Retrievers. Methods Age at gonadectomy was divided into four categories: intact (reference), ≤ 6 months, > 6 months ‒ ≤ 12 months, and > 12 months. Dogs with a Purina Body Condition Score of 7 or greater were classified as overweight or obese. Orthopedic injuries considered were the first instance of veterinary-reported cranial cruciate ligament injury and clinically evident osteoarthritis. We performed survival analyses on a cohort of Golden Retrievers to estimate the associations of interest using proportional hazards. We adjusted for age at study enrollment, owner-reported activity level, and dog’s sex. Results Compared to intact dogs, all gonadectomy age categories showed increased risk for the development of overweight/obesity. (≤ 6 months, HR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.36–2.40), p-value: <0.0001; 6 months to ≤ 12 months, HR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.77–2.73, p-value: < 0.0001; > 12 months, HR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.24–1.96, p-value: 0.0001). Compared to intact dogs, dogs who were ≤ 6 months at gonadectomy had increased risk for orthopedic injury (HR: 4.06, 95% CI: 2.15–7.67, p-value: <0.00001). Discussion This study presents prospectively acquired data demonstrating that gonadectomy is a risk factor for both overweight/obesity and chronic non-traumatic orthopedic injuries in a prospective cohort of Golden Retrievers. Our data suggest that gonadectomy at any age is a risk factor for overweight or obesity, but delaying gonadectomy until dogs are at least 6–12 months of age may help to decrease the risk for orthopedic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2959622004,"Although second-line immunotherapy obtained better outcomes than chemotherapy for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), it is expensive and only a minority of patients seem to benefit, based on early tumor progression post-immunotherapy. Notable host inflammation, characterized by biomarkers (e.g. neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR])), prolongs overall survival (OS) of surgery-, chemotherapy- and immunotherapy-treated patients. To our knowledge, no previous studies used biomarker evolution to analyze the immunotherapy impact on host inflammation. Immunotherapy mainly exerts its activity by lymphocyte reactivation.This retrospective study was conducted on patients, selected by their progression status just before their 4th nivolumab injection, and treated at Bordeaux and Limoges University Hospitals. A comparative group of at least 1-year responders was also selected. Clinical parameters and hematological data just before the 1st (baseline) and 4th nivolumab infusions were collected to calculate the NLR change (ΔNLR) between those two infusions. The combined impact of the different known prognostic factors was also analyzed with multivariable analyses.Fifty-nine patients were included. The 29 early progressors had significantly more frequent ΔNLR > 1 (p = 0.0007), OR 18.08 [95% CI 2.96-246.24] with progressive disease as best response to prior treatment line (p = 0.0014). ΔNLR < 1 prolonged OS (HR 0.001 [0.0007-0.18], p = 0.001); as did a partial response to prior line of systemic treatment (HR 0.14 [0.03--0.56], p = 0.005).Based on selected early progressors given second-line immunotherapy for advanced NSCLC, progression as best response to prior treatment and ΔNLR > 1 characterized the early progressors and shortened OS after starting nivolumab. This phenomenon questions nivolumab utility in patients with a major host neutrophil inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2960495050,"Characterizing the developmental trajectories of cognitive functions such as learning, memory and decision making across the lifespan faces fundamental challenges. Cognitive functions typically encompass several processes that can be differentially affected by age. Methodological issues also arise when comparisons are made across age groups that differ in basic performance measures, such as in average response times (RTs). Here we focus on procedural learning–a fundamental cognitive function that underlies the acquisition of cognitive, social, and motor skills–and demonstrate how disentangling subprocesses of learning and controlling for differences in average RTs can reveal different developmental trajectories across the human lifespan. Two hundred-seventy participants aged between 7 and 85 years performed a probabilistic sequence learning task that enabled us to separately measure two processes of procedural learning, namely general skill learning and statistical learning. Using raw RT measures, in between-group comparisons, we found a U-shaped trajectory with children and older adults exhibiting greater general skill learning compared to adolescents and younger adults. However, when we controlled for differences in average RTs (either by using ratio scores or focusing on a subsample of participants with similar average speed), only children (but not older adults) demonstrated superior general skill learning consistently across analyses. Testing the relationship between average RTs and general skill learning within age groups shed light on further age-related differences, suggesting that general skill learning measures are more affected by average speed in some age groups. Consistent with previous studies of learning probabilistic regularities, statistical learning showed a gradual decline across the lifespan, and learning performance seemed to be independent of average speed, regardless of the age group. Overall, our results suggest that children are superior learners in various aspects of procedural learning, including both general skill and statistical learning. Our study also highlights the importance to test, and control for, the effect of average speed on other RT measures of cognitive functions, which can fundamentally affect the interpretation of group differences in developmental, aging and clinical psychology and neuroscience studies."
https://openalex.org/W2957887686,"We describe the development and validation of a new instrument, the Classroom Discourse Observation Protocol (CDOP), which quantifies teacher discourse moves (TDMs) from observational data in undergraduate STEM classrooms. TDMs can be conceptualized as epistemic tools that can mediate classroom discussions. Through an inductive–deductive coding process, we identified commonly occurring TDMs among a group of biology instructors (n = 13, 37 class session) teaching in Active Learning Environments. We describe the CDOP coding scheme and its associated matrix that allows observers to reliably characterize TDMs in 2-min time intervals over the course of a class period. We present the protocol, discuss how it differs from existing classroom observation protocols, and describe the process by which it was developed and validated. Also, we show how this protocol is able to discriminate the discursive practices of instructors teaching in undergraduate STEM learning environments with sample qualitative and quantitative results that illustrate its utility for assessing and improving STEM instructional practices."
https://openalex.org/W2956197386,"Over the last two years, awareness about the sexual mistreatment of women has stunned the world. According to analysis by the New York Times, the defeat of Hilary Clinton and election of Donald Trump spurred a women's movement in the US that began in November of 2016 and resulted in protests across the country, including the largest single-day protest in history on January 21, 2017. Later that year, the #MeToo movement (starting in October 2017) and subsequent #TimesUp movement (starting in January 2018) galvanized women to unite against sexual assault and sexual harassment, which has become the hallmark of the current women's movement. But has anything changed over this time period in regard to the sexual harassment of women? Using a repeat cross-sectional survey from over 500 women collected at two points in time (September 2016 and September 2018), we found reduced levels of the most egregious forms of sexual harassment (unwanted sexual attention and sexual coercion) but increased levels of gender harassment in 2018. More importantly, sexual harassment had a weaker relationship with women's negative self-views (lower self-esteem, higher self-doubt) in 2018 compared to 2016. Qualitative interviews collected from women in the fall of 2016 and in the fall of 2018 from the same women, support the quantitative data. They suggest that the changes in sexual harassment are due to the increased scrutiny on the topic. The interviewees also emphasize that they feel better supported and empowered and are not ashamed to speak up about sexual harassment."
https://openalex.org/W2961368723,"During endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions, an adaptive signaling network termed the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated. The UPR's function is to increase ER protein-folding capacity in order to attenuate ER stress, restore ER homeostasis, and, most importantly, promote cell survival. X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) is one component of the UPR and is a proadaptive transcription factor that is subject to transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational control. In the present study, we identified a post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by miR-34c-5p that governs the expression of both the spliced (active) and unspliced (latent) forms of XBP1 mRNAs. We showed that miR-34c-5p directly attenuates spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) mRNA levels during ER stress and thus regulates the proadaptive component of the UPR that is mediated by XBP1s without interfering with the induction of apoptotic responses.-Bartoszewska, S., Cabaj, A., Dąbrowski, M., Collawn, J.

https://openalex.org/W2961402519,"Fructose consumption is rising globally, but maternal high fructose intake might adversely affect offspring. Our previous report demonstrated that excess maternal fructose intake impairs hippocampal function in offspring, indicating that the hippocampi of offspring are highly sensitive to maternal fructose. Here, we examined the effect of maternal high fructose on mitochondrial physiology and uncoupling protein (UCP) expression. Rat dams received a 20% fructose solution during gestation and lactation. Immediately after weaning, offspring hippocampi were isolated. Maternal high fructose consumption attenuated the mitochondrial O2 consumption rate and stimulated lipid hydroperoxide production in the hippocampi of offspring. Reduced Ucp5 and mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) mRNA levels were also observed after maternal exposure to fructose. We assessed the promoter regions of both genes and found that this treatment enhanced DNA methylation levels. In addition, luciferase assays showed that this DNA methylation could reduce the transcription of both genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that specificity protein 1 binding to the Ucp5 promoter regions was reduced by DNA methylation. In addition, Ucp5 knockdown induced the up-regulation of reactive oxygen species levels in a rat brain glioma cell line, whereas reduced O2 consumption was observed with Tfam knockdown. Maternal high fructose intake thus induces reduced O2 oxygen consumption and increases oxidative stress in offspring, at least partly through epigenetic mechanisms involving Ucp5 and Tfam.—Yamada, H., Munetsuna, E., Yamazaki, M., Mizuno, G., Sadamoto, N., Ando, Y., Fujii, R., Shiogama, K., Ishikawa, H., Suzuki, K., Shimono, Y., Ohashi, K., Hashimoto, S.

https://openalex.org/W2957833861,"Introduction Little is known on how the domain and intensity of physical activity (PA) associates with metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of this study was to examine associations between PA domains (leisure-time, domestic, active transport, total walking and total PA), PA intensities (light, moderate and vigorous) and PA levels with MetS in the general adult population. Methods Cross-sectional study. Anthropometry, blood biochemistry, 79-item PA-questionnaire, lifestyle and medical history were evaluated in a representative sample of Canary Island adults (n = 6,729). MetS was diagnosed using the harmonized IDF-NHLBI-AHA criteria. T-test and multivariable logistic regression was used to analyse associations between PA domains and intensities with MetS vs. no MetS, controlling for socio-demographic, lifestyle, family antecedents and body mass index (BMI). Results For each MET-h/day spent in moderate-vigorous PA intensities, as well as in recreational domain, active transport, total walking and total PA, the odds of MetS decreased between 3–10%. Energy expenditure exclusively in light and domestic PAs was not associated with MetS, however it was important to achieve a total PA level of 3 MET-h/day, which reduced the odds of MetS by 23%. This reduction was blunted in those with more than 2 h/d of TV watching time. A PA level of 3 MET-h/d also nullified the risk of MetS in those with low PA and high TV consumption. Conclusions Some types of leisure time PAs may contribute more than others to reducing MetS. Light and domestic PA play a complementary role in enhancing energy expenditure in the general population. TV watching time above 2 h/d counteracted the MetS risk reduction associated with PA level, but PA level also reduced the risk of METs presented by those with a low level of PA and an excess TV watching time. Physical activity explains a greater amount of the variance of MetS than any other factors of lifestyle, education, sex and family history, and substantially mitigates the strong association of age and BMI with MetS."
https://openalex.org/W2958488348,"Land cover change is a dynamic phenomenon driven by synergetic biophysical and socioeconomic effects. It involves massive transitions from natural to less natural habitats and thereby threatens ecosystems and the services they provide. To retain intact ecosystems and reduce land cover change to a minimum of natural transition processes, a dense network of protected areas has been established across Europe. However, even protected areas and in particular the zones around protected areas have been shown to undergo land cover changes. The aim of our study was to compare land cover changes in protected areas, non-protected areas, and 1 km buffer zones around protected areas and analyse their relationship to climatic and socioeconomic factors across Europe between 2000 and 2012 based on earth observation data. We investigated land cover flows describing major change processes: urbanisation, afforestation, deforestation, intensification of agriculture, extensification of agriculture, and formation of water bodies. Based on boosted regression trees, we modelled correlations between land cover flows and climatic and socioeconomic factors. The results show that land cover changes were most frequent in 1 km buffer zones around protected areas (3.0% of all buffer areas affected). Overall, land cover changes within protected areas were less frequent than outside, although they still amounted to 18,800 km2 (1.5% of all protected areas) from 2000 to 2012. In some parts of Europe, urbanisation and intensification of agriculture still accounted for up to 25% of land cover changes within protected areas. Modelling revealed meaningful relationships between land cover changes and a combination of influencing factors. Demographic factors (accessibility to cities and population density) were most important for coarse-scale patterns of land cover changes, whereas fine-scale patterns were most related to longitude (representing the general east/west economic gradient) and latitude (representing the north/south climatic gradient)."
https://openalex.org/W2959272908,"Coffee berry borer (CBB, Hypothenemus hampei) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) is the most destructive pest of coffee worldwide. Information on CBB development times can be used to predict the initiation of new infestation cycles early in the coffee-growing season and thus inform the timing of insecticide applications. While laboratory estimates of CBB development under constant conditions exist, they have not been applied under the heterogeneous environmental conditions that characterize many coffee-growing regions. We measured CBB development times and abundance in commercial coffee farms across an elevational gradient on Hawai‘i Island and applied thermal accumulation models from previous laboratory studies to test their fit to field data. Artificial lures were used to infest coffee berries at five farms ranging in elevation from 279–792 m, and weather variables were monitored at macro (farm-level) and micro (branch-level) scales. CBB development was followed in the field from the time of initial berry infestation by the founding female through the development of F1 mature adults. Mean development time from egg to adult across all sites was 38.5 ± 3.46 days, while the mean time required for the completion of a full life cycle (from time of infestation to presence of mature F1 females) was 50.9 ± 3.35 days. Development time increased with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. Using macro-scale temperature data and two different estimates for the lower temperature threshold (14.9°C and 13.9°C), we estimated a mean requirement of 332 ± 14 degree-days and 386 ± 16 degree-days, respectively, from the time of berry infestation to the initiation of a new reproductive cycle in mature coffee berries. Similar estimates were obtained using micro-scale temperature data, indicating that macro-scale temperature monitoring is sufficient for life-cycle prediction. We also present a model relating elevation to number of CBB generations per month. Our findings suggest that CBB development times from laboratory studies are generally applicable to field conditions on Hawai‘i Island and can be used as a decision support tool to improve IPM strategies for this worldwide pest of coffee."
https://openalex.org/W2960591641,"Environmental DNA is increasingly being used for assessing the presence and relative abundance of fish in freshwater, but existing protocols typically rely on filtering large volumes of water which is not always practical. We compared the effects of water volume, filtration type and eDNA extraction procedures in the detection of fish in three freshwater bodies (pond, lake and river) using a short fragment of the 12s rRNA mtDNA gene. Quantification of eDNA capture efficiency after DNA extraction, as well as amplification efficiency, were evaluated by conventional PCR and quantitative PCR. No significant differences on eDNA capture yield were found among freshwater bodies, but increasing water volume had a positive effect on eDNA capture and amplification efficiency. Although highest eDNA capture rates were obtained using 2 L of filtered water, 100 mL syringe filtration in combination with ethanol- sodium acetate precipitation proved to be more practical and increased quantitative PCR amplification efficiency by 6.4%. Our results indicate that such method may be optimal to detect fish species effectively across both lotic and lentic freshwater environments."
https://openalex.org/W2960864739,"Background The link between inflammation and carcinogenesis is indisputable. In trying to understand key factors at play, cancer research has developed an interest in the toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have shown signs of having prognostic value in various adenocarcinomas. We began investigating the expression of toll-like receptors 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 to evaluate their prognostic value of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Methods We collected tumor biopsies from 154 stage I-III PDAC patients surgically treated at Helsinki University Hospital between 2002 and 2011, excluding patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. We used tissue microarray slides and immunohistochemistry to assess expression of TLRs 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 in PDAC tissue. Immunopositivity scores and clinicopathological characteristics were subjected to Fisher’s exact test or the linear-by-linear association test. For the survival analysis, we applied the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, and the Cox regression proportional hazard model served for univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Strong TLR1 expression was observable in 60 (39%), strong TLR3 in 48 (31%), strong TLR5 in 58 (38%), strong TLR7 in 14 (9%), and strong TLR9 in 22 (14%) patients. The multivariate analysis showed strong TLR1 expression to associate with better survival than moderate, low, or negative expression (HR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.47–0.99; p = 0.044). Additionally, those few patients with tumors negative for TLR1, TLR3, TLR7, or TLR9 fared poorly (HR = 2.41; 95% CI 1.31–4.43; p = 0.005; n = 13). Conclusion Strong TLR1 expression suggested better prognosis in PDAC patients, whereas negative expression of TLR1, TLR3, TLR7, or TLR9 was a sign of poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2956619578,"Women coping with female sexual interest/arousal disorder (FSIAD) report lower sexual and relationship satisfaction compared to healthy controls. In community samples, high sexual communal strength (i.e., the motivation to meet a partner’s sexual needs) is associated with higher sexual desire and satisfaction, but high unmitigated sexual communion (i.e., the prioritization of a partner’s needs to the exclusion of one’s own needs) is associated with lower sexual satisfaction. People higher in sexual communal strength report engaging in sex for approach goals (i.e., to enhance intimacy in their relationship), but not for avoidance goals (i.e., to avert conflict or a partner’s disappointment) and this is one reason why they report greater sexual desire. In the current sample of 97 women diagnosed with FSIAD and their partners we investigated the association between sexual communal strength and unmitigated sexual communion and sexual well-being (i.e., sexual desire, sexual satisfaction and sexual distress) and sexual goals (i.e., approach and avoidance goals). Women who reported higher sexual communal strength were more likely to pursue sex for approach goals and their partner reported greater sexual satisfaction. When partners reported higher sexual communal strength, they reported higher sexual desire, but when they reported higher unmitigated sexual communion, they reported higher sexual distress. Additional associations emerged for couples who engage in sex more (compared to less) frequently. Our findings demonstrate that being motivated to meet a partner’s sexual needs is associated with greater sexual well-being for couples coping with FSIAD, but when this motivation involves neglecting one’s own needs, people do not report greater sexual well-being and instead, partners report higher sexual distress."
https://openalex.org/W2961596567,"Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) are ad-hoc networks which are deployed at rivers, seas and oceans to explore and monitor the phenomena such as pollution control, seismic activities and petroleum mining etc. The sensor nodes of UWSNs have limited charging capabilities. UWSNs networks are generally operated under two deployment mechanisms i.e localization and non-localization based. However, in both the mechanisms, balanced energy utilization is a challenging issue. Inefficient usage of energy significantly affects stability period, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, path loss and throughput of a network. To efficiently utilize and harvest energy, this paper present a novel scheme called EH-ARCUN (Energy Harvesting Analytical approach towards Reliability with Cooperation for UWSNs) based on cooperation with energy harvesting. The scheme employs Amplify-and-Forward (AF) technique at relay nodes for data forwarding and Fixed Combining Ratio (FCR) technique at destination node to select accurate signal. The proposed technique selects relay nodes among its neighbor nodes based on harvested energy level. Most cooperation-based UWSN routing techniques do not exhibit energy harvesting mechanism at the relay nodes. EH-ARCUN deploys piezoelectric energy harvesting at relay nodes to improve the working capabilities of sensors in UWSNs. The proposed scheme is an extension of our previously implemented routing scheme called ARCUN for UWSNs. Performance of the proposed scheme is compared with ARCUN and RACE (Reliability and Adaptive Cooperation for efficient Underwater sensor Networks) schemes in term of stability period, packet delivery ratio, network throughput and path loss. Extensive simulation results show that EH-ARCUN performs better than both previous schemes in terms of the considered parameters."

SPART encodes for Spartin, a protein linked to endosomal trafficking and mitochondrial membrane potential maintenance. Here, we identified with whole exorne sequencing (WES) a novel frameshift mutation in the SPART gene in 2 brothers presenting an uncharacterized developmental delay and short stature. Functional characterization in an SH-SY5Y cell model shows that this mutation is associated with increased neurite outgrowth. These cells also show a marked decrease in mitochondrial complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) activity, coupled to decreased ATP synthesis and defective mitochondrial membrane potential. The cells also presented an increase in reactive oxygen species, extracellular pyruvate, and NADH levels, consistent with impaired complex I activity. In concordance with a severe mitochondrial failure, Spartin loss also led to an altered intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis that was restored after transient expression of wild-type Spartin. Our data provide for the first time a thorough assessment of Spartin loss effects, including impaired complex I activity coupled to increased extracellular pyruvate. In summary, through a WES study we assign a diagnosis of Troyer syndrome to otherwise undiagnosed patients, and by functional characterization we show that the novel mutation in SPART leads to a profound bioenergetic imbalance.—Diquigiovanni, C., Bergamini, C., Diaz, R., Liparulo, I., Bianco, F., Masin, L., Baldassarro, V.

https://openalex.org/W2960952240,"Objectives To determine the prevalence of polypharmacy prescription among type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients at a tertiary care department in Ningbo, China, and to determine factors that independently predict this polypharmacy prescription. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using an existing computerised medical records database. This database was screened from 2012 to 2017 for adult patients with T2DM and parameters like prescribed medicines and socio-demographic, behavioural and other medical information. Polypharmacy prescription was defined as the simultaneous prescription of ≥5 medicines by the clinician at the time of discharge for daily usage by the patient as part of his/her long-term treatment plan. Results The study inclusion criteria were satisfied by 3370 T2DM patients. Over a 5-year period, 72.2% (n = 2432) of T2DM patients were prescribed polypharmacy. On an average, eight medicines were prescribed to them. The odds of polypharmacy prescription increased with patients’ age (18–39 years: 1; 40–59 years: OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.28–2.71; and ≥60 years: 2.42, 1.65–3.55), duration of T2DM (≤1 year: 1; >5–10 years: 1.70, 1.10–2.62; and >10 years: 2.55, 1.68–3.89), and length of hospital stay (≤5 days: 1; >5–10 days: 2.43, 1.86–3.17; and >10 days: 2.99, 2.24–3.99), and were higher in those with poor blood glucose level (2.09, 1.67–2.62) and with comorbidities like other endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (2.24, 1.76–2.85), circulatory system diseases (4.35, 3.62–5.23), skin and subcutaneous tissue diseases (1.64, 1.04–2.59), and musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases (1.61, 1.27–2.03). The odds of polypharmacy prescription were lower in those with comorbidities like neoplasms (0.51, 0.36–0.70) and during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (0.06, 0.01–0.49). Conclusions Around three fourth of T2DM patients at the tertiary care department were prescribed polypharmacy, and the predictors were identified. The study findings could be taken into consideration in future interventional studies aimed at supporting medicines optimisation (and deprescribing) among these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2961072086,"The entrance of new males into non-human primate groups bears high social risk, yet migration is necessary to prevent inbreeding. Males are not always accepted in their new group. In the wild, males may increase the likelihood of successful group entry by choosing a new group based on their own and the group's characteristics. Understanding whether these characteristics also determine a male's ability to enter captive groups is crucial to improve introduction management. This study aims to identify which factors determine male introduction success (i.e. male stays in the group for at least 4 weeks) and long-term stability (i.e. the male does not cause considerable behavioural problems after success) after male introductions in captive groups of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), creating one-male groups. We studied 64 male introductions at the breeding colony of the Biomedical Primate Research Centre in Rijswijk, The Netherlands. 49 (77%) introductions were successful, with the male obtaining a long-term stable social position in the group in 38 (59%) introductions. Introductions of males that reached at least prime age, into groups with more adult females, but without pregnant females were most successful. Moreover, long-term stability was highest when males were heavier, were at least 3.5 years old when they were first removed from their natal group, and groups had few matrilines and no pregnant females were present. Males should be introduced at the time they would naturally immigrate, when they are strongest. Moreover, groups should consist of few large matrilines, as observed in the wild, with philoatric females and males that are removed at natural age. Our study highlights the importance of composing naturalistic groups and mimicking natural migration patterns to maintain long-term stable breeding groups in captivity."
https://openalex.org/W2958654545,"Progression of prostate cancer to lethal forms is marked by emergence of hormone-independent proliferation of the cancer cells. Nutritional and epidemiological studies have indicated that prostate cancer progression is correlated with the consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). To shed additional light on the cell-level mechanisms of the observed correlation, we compared the sensitivity of hormone-dependent and hormone-independent prostate cancer cells to growth medium supplementation with free PUFAs in a cell proliferation and viability assay. Our data show that the hormone-dependent cells are comparatively insensitive to various PUFAs, at the same time as the growth and viability of hormone-independent cells lines are strongly inhibited by most of the tested PUFAs, whether n–3 or n–6. We speculate that this difference may be at least partially responsible for the observed effects of specific dietary lipids in prostate cancer. The new data strengthen the case for dietary intervention as part of potential new therapeutic strategies seeking to impede prostate cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2959548011,"The Western Ghats are well known as a biodiversity hotspot, but the full extent of its snake diversity is yet to be uncovered. Here, we describe a new genus and species of vine snake Proahaetulla antiqua gen. et sp. nov., from the Agasthyamalai hills in the southern Western Ghats. It was found to be a member of the Ahaetuliinae clade, which currently comprises the arboreal snake genera Ahaetulla, Dryophiops, Dendrelaphis and Chrysopelea, distributed in South and Southeast Asia. Proahaetulla shows a sister relationship with all currently known taxa belonging to the genus Ahaetulla, and shares ancestry with Dryophiops. In addition to its phylogenetic position and significant genetic divergence, this new taxon is also different in morphology from members of Ahaetuliinae in a combination of characters, having 12–13 partially serrated keels on the dorsal scale rows, 20 maxillary teeth and 3 postocular scales. Divergence dating reveals that the new genus is ancient, dating back to the Mid-Oligocene, and is one of the oldest persisting monotypic lineages of snakes in the Western Ghats. This discovery adds to the growing list of ancient lineages endemic to the Agasthyamalai hills and underscores the biogeographic significance of this isolated massif in the southern Western Ghats."
https://openalex.org/W2960161594,"C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) is essential for migration of dendritic cells (DCs) to draining lymph nodes. PU.1/Spi1 is a transcription factor playing a critical role in the gene regulation of DCs. PU.1 knockdown decreased the expression of CCR7 in bone marrow-derived DCs and subsequently attenuated migration in vitro and in vivo. Reporter assays, EMSA, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PU.1 binds to the most proximal Ets motif of the Ccr7 promoter, which is involved in transcriptional activation. The CCR7 expression level, which was higher in the programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2)+ population than in the PD-L2- population and was markedly suppressed by TGF-β treatment, coincided with the binding level of PU.1 to the Ccr7 promoter. The PU.1 binding level in CCR7high mesenteric lymph nodes DCs was higher than in other DC subtypes. The involvement of PU.1 in the expression of the CCR7 gene was also observed in human DCs. We conclude that PU.1 plays a pivotal role in DC migration by transactivating the CCR7 gene via the Ets motif in the promoter in both humans and mice.-Yashiro, T., Takeuchi, H., Nakamura, S., Tanabe, A., Hara, M., Uchida, K., Okumura, K., Kasakura, K., Nishiyama, C.

https://openalex.org/W2960273638,"Generalized seizures engage bilateral networks from their onset at a low temporal scale. Previous studies findings have demonstrated focal/local brain activity abnormalities in the patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows the detection of aberrant spontaneous brain activity in GTCS. Little is known, however, about alterations of dynamics (temporal variability) of spontaneous brain activity. It also remains unclear whether temporal variability of spontaneous brain activity is associated with disease severity. To address these questions, the current study assessed patients with GTCS (n = 35), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs, n = 33) who underwent resting state fMRI. We first assessed the dynamics of spontaneous brain activity using dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (dALFF). Furthermore, the temporal variability of brain activity was quantified as the variance of dALFF across sliding window. Compared to HCs, patients with GTCS showed hyper-temporal variability of dALFF in parts of the default mode network, whereas they showed hypo-temporal variability in the somatomotor cortex. Furthermore, dynamic ALFF in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex was positively correlated with duration of disease, indicating that disease severity is associated with excessive variability. These results suggest both an excessive variability and excessive stability in patients with GTCS. Overall, the current findings from brain activity dynamics contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of generalized seizure."
https://openalex.org/W2959472121,"Evidence using well-established imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrocorticography, suggest that speech-specific cortical responses can be functionally localised by contrasting speech responses with an auditory baseline stimulus, such as time-reversed (TR) speech or signal-correlated noise (SCN). Furthermore, these studies suggest that SCN is a more effective baseline than TR speech. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a relatively novel, optically-based imaging technique with features that make it ideal for investigating speech and language function in paediatric populations. However, it is not known which baseline is best at isolating speech activation when imaging using fNIRS. We presented normal speech, TR speech and SCN in an event-related format to 25 normally-hearing children aged 6-12 years. Brain activity was measured across frontal and temporal brain areas in both cerebral hemispheres whilst children passively listened to the auditory stimuli. In all three conditions, significant activation was observed bilaterally in channels targeting superior temporal regions when stimuli were contrasted against silence. Unlike previous findings in infants, we found no significant activation in the region of interest over superior temporal cortex in school-age children when normal speech was contrasted against either TR speech or SCN. Although no statistically significant lateralisation effects were observed in the region of interest, a left-sided channel targeting posterior temporal regions showed significant activity in response to normal speech only, and was investigated further. Significantly greater activation was observed in this left posterior channel compared to the corresponding channel on the right side under the normal speech vs SCN contrast only. Our findings suggest that neither TR speech nor SCN are suitable auditory baselines for functionally isolating speech-specific processing in an experimental set up involving fNIRS with 6-12 year old children."
https://openalex.org/W2961593078,"Considering the essential role of chemotaxis of adherent, slow-moving cells in processes such as tumor metastasis or wound healing, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms and cues that direct migration of cells through tissues is highly desirable. The state-of-the-art chemotaxis instruments (e.g. microfluidic-based devices, bridge assays) can generate well-defined, long-term stable chemical gradients, crucial for quantitative investigation of chemotaxis in slow-moving cells. However, the majority of chemotaxis tools are designed for the purpose of an in-depth, but labor-intensive analysis of migratory behavior of single cells. This is rather inefficient for applications requiring higher experimental throughput, as it is the case of e.g. clinical examinations, chemoattractant screening or studies of the chemotaxis-related signaling pathways based on subcellular perturbations. Here, we present an advanced migration assay for accelerated and facilitated evaluation of the chemotactic response of slow-moving cells. The revised chemotaxis chamber contains a hydrogel microstructure–the migration arena, designed to enable identification of chemotactic behavior of a cell population in respect to the end-point of the experiment. At the same time, the assay in form of a microscopy slide enables direct visualization of the cells in either 2D or 3D environment, and provides a stable and linear gradient of chemoattractant. We demonstrate the correctness of the assay on the model study of HT-1080 chemotaxis in 3D and on 2D surface. Finally, we apply the migration arena chemotaxis assay to screen for a chemoattractant of primary keratinocytes, cells that play a major role in wound healing, being responsible for skin re-epithelialization and a successful wound closure. In direction of new therapeutic strategies to promote wound repair, we identified the chemotactic activity of the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands EGF and TGFα (transforming growth factor α)."

In this paper, we present results of 2014–17 aerial nest surveys of the major orangutan populations in Sabah and compare them with baseline data produced during surveys conducted in 2002–03 using similar methods. Our results show three important points: a) by increasing the survey effort (estimated at 15–25% cover), sparsely scattered orangutan sub-populations not recorded in the previous aerial surveys were located and the accuracy of the nest count estimates is expected to improve; b) large populations in the interior forests of Sabah, occupying sustainably managed logged and unlogged forests, have been stable over 15 years and are of vital importance for the species’ conservation; c) fragmented populations located in eastern Sabah, that are surrounded by extensive oil palm plantations, have declined at varying rates."
https://openalex.org/W2960660378,"Background As population health and well-being are influenced by multiple factors that cut across sectoral boundaries, an intersectoral approach that acknowledges and leverages the multiple determinants, actors and sectors at play is increasingly seen as critical for achieving meaningful and lasting improvements. In this study, we utilize social network analysis (SNA) to characterize the intersectoral collaboration between the organizations working on maternal & child health (MCH) and water & sanitation (WASH) before and immediately after the implementation of HCL Foundation (HCLF)-funded HCL Samuday Project (2015–2017) in a rural block of Uttar Pradesh state, India. While SNA has been used to examine public health issues, few have used it monitor stakeholder relationships, intervene, improve and facilitate project implementation involving intersectoral partnerships, particularly in the context of a low-and middle-income countries. Method An organization-level SNA was conducted with 31 key informants from 24 organizations working on MCH and/or WASH in Kachhauna, Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured interviews between June and September 2017. Density, centrality and homophily were calculated to describe the network and a qualitative analysis was also conducted to identify the strengths and weaknesses of collaboration between organizations working on MCH and WASH. Results Overall, our findings showed that the network of organizations working on MCH and WASH in Kachhauna grew in number since the implementation of Samuday. HCLF rapidly achieved centrality, thus positioning the organization to serve as a gatekeeper of information and enabling it to play a coordinator role within the network. Direct collaboration between other organizations working on MCH and WASH was low at both time points. Interviews with key informants indicated widespread interest in increasing interorganizational interactions and engagement throughout the network. Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility and practical application of SNA for projects like Samuday that involve intersectoral collaboration. It also provides lessons about the use of SNA with organizations as the unit of analysis and in the context of rural India, including challenges, practical considerations, and limitations."
https://openalex.org/W2956418427,"Wide crosses between genetically diverged parents may reveal novel loci for crop improvement that are not apparent in crosses between elite cultivars. The landrace Chevallier was a noted malting barley first grown in 1820. To identify potentially novel alleles for agronomic traits, Chevallier was crossed with the modern malting cultivar NFC Tipple generating two genetically diverse recombinant inbred line populations. Genetic maps were produced using genotyping-by-sequencing and 384-SNP genotyping, and the populations were phenotyped for agronomic traits to allow the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Within the semi-dwarf 1 (sdw1) region on chromosome 3H Chevallier conferred increased plant height and reduced tiller number, with QTL for these traits explaining 79.4% and 35.2% of the phenotypic variance observed, respectively. Chevallier was also associated with powdery mildew susceptibility, with a QTL on 1H accounting for up to 19.1% of the variance and resistance at this locus most likely resulting from an Mla variant from Tipple. Two novel QTL for physiological leaf spotting were identified on 3H and 7H, explaining up to 17.1% of the variance and with the Chevallier allele reducing symptom severity on 7H. Preliminary micromalting analysis was also undertaken to compare the malting characteristics of Chevallier and Tipple. Chevallier malt contained significantly lower levels of both α-amylase and wort β-glucan than Tipple malt, however no significant differences were observed for the remaining malting parameters measured. This suggests that the most obvious improvements in barley since the introduction of Chevallier are for agronomic traits such as height, yield and lodging resistance rather than for malting characteristics. Overall, our results demonstrate that this wide cross between Chevallier and Tipple may provide a source of novel QTL for barley breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2957746782,"Climate-related studies have generally focussed upon physiologically well-defined ‘mechanistic’ traits rather than ‘functional’ ones relating indirectly to resource capture. Nevertheless, field responses to climate are likely to typically include both ‘mechanistic’ specialization to climatic extremes and ‘functional’ strategies that optimize resource acquisition during less climatically-severe periods. Here, this hypothesis was tested. Seventeen traits (six ‘functional’, six ‘mechanistic’ and five ‘intermediate’) were measured from 19 populations of oleaster (wild olive) along a climatic gradient in Morocco. Principal components analysis of the trait dataset identified size and the ‘worldwide leaf economics spectrum’ as PCA axes 1 and 2. However, contrary to our prediction, these axes, and commonly-measured ‘functional’ traits, were little correlated with climate. Instead, PCA 3, perhaps relating to water-use and succulence, together stomatal density, specific leaf water content and leaf shape, patterned with altitude, aridity, rainfall and temperature. We concluded that, at least for slow-growing species, such as oleaster, ‘mechanistic’ traits are key to identifying mechanisms of climatic restriction. Meaningful collaboration between ‘mechanistic’ and ‘functional’ disciplines provides the best way of improving our understanding of the global impacts of climate change on species distribution and performance."
https://openalex.org/W2957517665,"Earlier work by one of us examined a historical corpus of portraits and found that artists often paint the subject such that one eye is centred horizontally. If due to psychological mechanisms constraining artistic composition, this eye-centring bias should be detectable also in portraits by non-professionals. However, this finding has been questioned both on theoretical and empirical grounds. Here we tested eye-centring in a larger (N ~ = 4000) and more representative set of selfies spontaneously posted on Instagram from six world cities. In contrast with previous selfie results, the distribution of the most-centred eye position peaked almost exactly at the horizontal centre of the image and was statistically different from predictions based on realistic Monte-Carlo predictions. In addition, we observed a small but statistically reliable pseudoneglect effect as well as a preference for centring the left-eye. An eye-centring tendency appears to exist in self-portraits by non-artists."
https://openalex.org/W2959796218,"Development of a healthy musculoskeletal system is of high concern for horse breeders and users. A longitudinal field study was performed in order to: (i) evaluate growth patterns and long-term changes on bone quality, bone metabolism, growth factors and metabolic variables in the Lusitano horse; and (ii) retrospectively assess whether these changes were related with radiographic findings regarding osteochondrosis-like lesions (OC) at the onset of training. Thirty-four Lusitano foals born and raised at four stud-farms, were periodically weighed (BW), and measured (withers height-WH) from birth to 36 months of age. On the same days, blood samples were collected for determination of osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), leptin, insulin, glucose, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus and magnesium plasma concentrations, and quantitative ultrasound measurements were performed on the right third metacarpal bone (McIII). At the end of the study horses underwent radiographic examination of the four fetlocks, hocks and stifles. According to their radiographic status (OC negative vs. OC positive), Richards growth function was adjusted to BW and WH data. Instantaneous BW and WH growth rates (BW IADG and WH IADG) were calculated for each foal, from the resolution of the first derivative of growth models for seven age-classes. The presence of radiographic findings compatible with OC at the onset of training was associated with changes in BW and WH growth rates. Positive horses presented higher BW IADG from six to 18 months of age and lower WH IADG before 45 days of age (P<0.001). Speed of sound measurements (SOS), bone markers, growth factors and other metabolic variables change markedly with age (P<0.01). OC positive horses tended to have lower SOS values at the lateral region of McIII, lower IGF-I, and higher insulin and PTH concentrations (P<0.1). This study provides indirect evidence that monitoring foals’ growth during the first year of life may be of assistance in managing the occurrence of OC. Further studies with a higher number of animals and a controlled feed intake should be pursued."

Although the effects of altitude on cardiorespiratory and hematological quantities on athletics performances are well known, but there is little information about its underlying effect on chronotype orientations.In this cross-sectional study 60 male college students with mean age 20±1.3 years from high and low altitude regions living in a tropical setting in Ethiopia were included. The participants' chronotype was determined using the self-administered Horne and Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaires (MEQ). Measurements and estimations of hematological and cardiorespiratory parameters were performed from 7:00-9:00 AM, East African time zone, in order to minimize any variations that might occur in the course of the day. A multivariate binary logistic regression model was fitted to analyze the underlying chronotype predictors.28 (93.9%) of participants from high altitude were mainly intermediate type (I-type) dominant with (MEQ = 42-58). While, 16 (55.2%) of participants from low altitudes were morning type (M-type) dominant chronotype with (MEQ = 59-69). Our main finding confirmed that altitude is an independent predictor of chronotype orientations of the participants (p<0.015). Thus, the results of the multivariate analysis seem to indicate that, participants from low and high altitudes may be uniquely oriented towards either M-type or I-type chronotype respectively (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 4.772, 95% CI = 3.748-4618458). However, no significant difference on cardiorespiratory and hematological quantities between I-type and M-type chronotype of students from low altitude living in the same setting was reported (p > 0.05).Our finding, reported for the first time that, the human chronotype varies according to the altitude, with no underlying effect of cardiorespiratory and hematological quantities."

Using this we extracted nuclear morphometric and chromatin texture based features and were able to discriminate between normal and cancer cells with similar accuracy as wide-field fluorescence microscopy. We were also able to detect subtle changes in nuclear and chromatin features in cells subjected to compressive forces, cytoskeletal perturbations and cytokine stimulation, thereby highlighting the sensitivity of the portable microscope.

In addition, three new species of Neodon (N. linzhiensis, N. medogensis, and N. nyalamensis) have recently been described from Tibet. Analyses of concatenated mitochondrial (Cytb, COI) and nuclear (Ghr, Rbp3) genes recovered Neodon as a well-supported monophyletic clade including all the recently described and relocated species. Kimura-2-parameter distance between Neodon from western Nepal compared to N. sikimensis (K2P = 13.1) and N. irene (K2P = 13.4) was equivalent to genetic distances observed between recognized species of this genus. The specimens sampled from western Nepal were recovered sister to N. sikimensis in the concatenated analysis. However, analyses conducted exclusively with mitochondrial loci did not support this relationship. The occlusal patterns of the first lower (m1) and third upper (M3) molars were simpler in specimens from western Nepal in comparison to N. sikimensis from eastern Nepal and India. Twelve craniodental characters and four external field measurements were examined from specimens of N. sikimensis from eastern Nepal and India, N. irene, and Neodon from western Nepal. Neodon from western Nepal were significantly different from N. sikimensis from eastern Nepal and India in ten out of 16 characters measured and from N. irene for all characters except ear height. Specimens from western Nepal were smaller in size than N. sikimensis from Eastern Nepal and India and larger than N. irene.

https://openalex.org/W2959317549,"Cortical thickness (cTh) is one of the main factors determining a bone's mechanical properties, and its quantification is therefore critical for understanding and monitoring bone pathologies such as osteoporosis. Axial quantitative acoustics (ax-QA) offers a non-radiative, non-invasive method to measure cTh. Even though previous works have ascertained ax-QA's ability to measure azimuthally varying cTh, the effect of axially varying cTh remains unclear. Furthermore, previous experiments and theoretical predictions indicate that measurement of the fundamental flexural mode at low frequencies in the kHz range could increase sensitivity to cTh. However, due to the associated long wavelengths, the approximation of bone geometry as a tube could break down at such frequencies. The presented study therefore investigates a) the sensitivity of ax-QA measurements to cTh in the kHz-regime, b) the applicability of tube theory in this regime, and c) the effect of varying cTh along the long axis on the bone.Axial-transmission acoustic measurements were performed at 3kHz on 14 bone phantoms with a femur-like cross-section and a) axially varying cortical thickness or b) axially and azimuthally varying cortical thickness (cTh-range: 1.5mm-7.5mm). Experimental results were compared to theoretical predictions based on an exact elastic tube theory.Phase velocity measurements using low-frequency ax-QA exhibited a high sensitivity to local cTh less than 4mm, albeit with a complex, not yet understood pattern. Tube theory failed to predict the wave's behavior in the kHz range, indicating that due to the corresponding long wavelengths the bone can no longer be approximated by a tube, thus requiring more faithful modelling of the bone geometry. The fact that results from both types of phantoms were similar (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.94) further indicates that the slowly varying cTh along the bone's long axis did not strongly affect wave propagation as measured by ax-QA measurements."

Although it has been reported that the use of a feedback device is effective, the effects of feedback timing and frequency on CPR training have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to clarify the influence of feedback frequency and timing on the acquisition of CPR skills.Sixty-eight undergraduates were first divided into female (n = 32) and male (n = 36) groups, and randomly assigned to one of four groups for each sex: concurrent-100%, concurrent-50%, terminal-100%, and terminal-50% feedback groups. The randomization was performed using a lottery method. This study consisted of a pre-test, practice sessions, a post-test, and a follow-up test. In the practice sessions, the participants performed six 2-minute CPR sessions in accordance with the condition assigned using mannequins and feedback devices. The post-test was conducted 24 hours after the completion of the practice sessions and the follow-up test was conducted 3 months after the completion of the practice sessions. The primary outcome of the study was the overall score at the follow-up test.The results of the overall score at the follow-up test for each group were 88.2 ± 9.6% for concurrent-100%, 92.2 ± 6.4% for concurrent-50%, 82.6 ± 16.4% for terminal-100%, and 85.2 ± 16.9% for terminal-50%. We did not find any statistically significant difference for the overall score at the follow-up test among the four groups (p = 0.173). The ANOVA for the test sessions revealed that there were no significant main effects of feedback timing (p = 0.135) or frequency (p = 0.765), and no significant interaction between timing and frequency (p = 0.997).The present study reveals that the use of feedback devices is an important factor for higher quality CPR training, regardless of the timing and frequency with which they are used."

Secondly, the formulas for the queue size distribution, loss ratio and mean duration of the busy period, are derived. Thirdly, numerical examples are given, including optimizations of the shape of the dropping function with regard to the combined cost of the queue size and loss ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2957874855,"Attitudes towards aging are often negative, a phenomenon known as ageism. However, personal contact with older adults and intergenerational exchange in the context of close families may mitigate such negative tendencies. So far, these effects have been studied in Western and industrialized contexts. The present study extended this work to the Cook Islands archipelago, a group of islands in the South Pacific characterized by low levels of industrialization and relative isolation from foreign influences. We tested the hypothesis that attitudes toward aging in the Cook Islands would be more positive than in the world at large, and that, within the archipelago, attitudes towards aging would be more positive in smaller, less industrialized communities with closer family ties. Participants (n = 70), were recruited from three islands varying in community size and strength of the family ties among inhabitants. They rated their aging attitudes on four dimensions. Contrary to our hypotheses, attitudes in the Cook Islands did not differ from those reported in industrialized nations and did not vary significantly across islands, even after controlling for personal contact to older adults. Potential limitations and implications for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2958232366,"Background The literature regarding diverticular disease of the intestines (DDI) almost entirely concerns hospital-based care; DDI managed in primary care settings is rarely addressed. Aim To estimate how often DDI is managed in primary care, using antibiotics dispensing data. Design and setting Hospitalisation records of New Zealand residents aged 30+ years during 2007–2016 were individually linked to databases of community-dispensed oral antibiotics. Method Patients with an index hospital admission 2007–2016 including a DDI diagnosis (ICD-10-AM = K57) were grouped by acute/non-acute hospitalisation. We compared use of guideline-recommended oral antibiotics for the period 2007–2016 for these people with ten individually-matched non-DDI residents, taking the case’s index date. Multivariable negative binomial models were used to estimate rates of antibiotic use. Results From almost 3.5 million eligible residents, data were extracted for 51,059 index cases (20,880 acute, 30,179 non-acute) and 510,581 matched controls; mean follow-up = 8.9 years. Dispensing rates rose gradually over time among controls, from 47 per 100 person-years (/100py) prior to the index date, to 60/100py after 3 months. In comparison, dispensing was significantly higher for those with DDI: for those with acute DDI, rates were 84/100py prior to the index date, 325/100py near the index date, and 141/100py after 3 months, while for those with non-acute DDI 75/100py, 108/100py and 99/100py respectively. Following an acute DDI admission, community-dispensed antibiotics were dispensed at more than twice the rate of their non-DDI counterparts for years, and were elevated even before the index DDI hospitalisation. Conclusion DDI patients experience high use of antibiotics. Evidence is needed that covers primary-care and informs self-management of recurrent, chronic or persistent DDI."
https://openalex.org/W2958736249,"Embryoid bodies (EBs) are three dimensional aggregates of pluripotent stem cells primarily used to investigate morphogenesis and cell toxicity, are also attractive tools in regenerative medicine. While embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent cells (IPSCs) have been shown to form EBs in mouse, primate and humans, EB formation have not been previously demonstrated in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Here we show that rat MSCs form EBs; which express regulatory T cell (Treg) marker Foxp3 and CC chemokine CCL1 receptor CCR8. We show a novel method for formation of EBs from MSCs under stress and demonstrate that the induction of FoxP3+ CCR8+ EBs is dependent upon CCL1 gradients which mediate cell proliferation, migration and invasion of mTregs. The identification of EBs and novel FoxP3+ CCR8+ regulatory T cells (mTregs) for selective conversion and isolation of bone marrow derived MSCs offers novel avenues for research, diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2961947716,"Albeit osteoporosis is one of the most prevalent disorders in the aged population, treatment options stimulating the activity of bone-forming osteoblasts are still limited. We and others have previously identified sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) as a bone remodeling coupling factor, which is released by bone-resorbing osteoclasts to stimulate bone formation. Moreover, S1pr3, encoding one of the five known S1P receptors (S1P3), was found differentially expressed in osteoblasts, and S1P3 deficiency corrected the moderate high bone mass phenotype of a mouse model (deficient for the calcitonin receptor) with increased S1P release from osteoclasts. In the present study we addressed the question, if S1P3 deficiency would also influence the skeletal phenotype of mice lacking S1P-lyase (encoded by Sgpl1), which display markedly increased S1P levels due to insufficient degradation. Consistent with previous reports, the majority of Sgpl1-deficient mice died before or shortly after weaning, and this lethality was not influenced by additional S1P3 deficiency. At 3 weeks of age, Sgpl1-deficient mice displayed increased trabecular bone mass, which was associated with enhanced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, but also with increased bone formation. Most importantly however, none of the skeletal parameters assessed by μCT, histomorphometry and serum analyses were significantly influenced by additional S1P3 deficiency. Taken together, our findings fully support the concept that S1P is a potent osteoanabolic molecule, although S1P3 is not the sole receptor mediating this influence. Since S1P receptors are considered excellent drug targets, it is now required to screen for the impact of other family members on bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2962519191,"Evidence suggests that people with disabilities are the most marginalised and vulnerable group within any population. However, little is known about the extent of inequality between people with and without disabilities in contexts where the majority of persons experience extreme poverty and hardship. This includes in Liberia, where very little is understood about the lives of disabled people in general. This study uses a multidimensional wellbeing framework to understand perceived relative inequality associated with disability by assessing several facets of wellbeing across and within households containing disabled members (N = 485) or households with no disabled members (N = 538) in Liberian communities (Total individuals surveyed, N = 2020). Statistical comparisons (adjusted for age, sex, education and wealth differences and clustered at the household, village and county level) reveal that disabled Liberians are managing similarly to non-disabled Liberians in terms of income and education, but experience many perceived relative inequalities including in life satisfaction, transport access, political participation and social inclusion. Our results further suggest that disability may lead to perceived relative inequality at the household level in terms of trust held in neighbours. However, they also show that being the head of a household may protect against perceived relative inequality in certain dimensions (e.g. healthcare and transport access, political participation) irrespective of disability status. Results are discussed in terms of practical implications for development efforts in Liberia and for disabled people in other low- and middle-income settings."
https://openalex.org/W2960518639,"To investigate the cost differences between magnetic resonance-guided focussed ultrasound (MRgFUS) and unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of medication-refractory essential tremor (ET) in Japan using a cost-minimisation model.A cost-minimisation model estimated total costs for MRgFUS and unilateral DBS by summing the pre-procedure, procedure, and post-procedure costs over a 12-month time horizon, using data from published sources and expert clinical opinion. The model base case considered medical costs from fee-for-service tariffs. Scenario analyses investigated the use of Diagnosis Procedure Combination tariffs, a diagnosis-related group-based fixed-payment system, and the addition of healthcare professional labour costs healthcare professionals using tariffs from the Japanese Health Insurance Federation for Surgery. One-way sensitivity analyses altered costs associated with tremor recurrence after MRgFUS, the extraction rate following unilateral DBS, the length of hospitalisation for unilateral DBS and the procedure duration for MRgFUS. The impact of uncertainty in model parameters on the model results was further explored using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.Compared to unilateral DBS, MRgFUS was cost saving in the base case and Diagnosis Procedure Combination cost scenario, with total savings of JPY400,380 and JPY414,691, respectively. The majority of savings were accrued at the procedural stage. Including labour costs further increased the cost differences between MRgFUS and unilateral DBS. Cost savings were maintained in each sensitivity analysis and the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, demonstrating that the model results are highly robust.In the Japanese healthcare setting, MRgFUS could be a cost saving option versus unilateral DBS for treating medication-refractory ET. The model results may even be conservative, as the cost of multiple follow-ups for unilateral DBS and treatment costs for adverse events associated with each procedure were not included. This model is also consistent with the results of other economic analyses of MRgFUS versus DBS in various settings worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2956686336,"A crucial factor in U.S. energy infrastructure development is the degree to which citizens that reside near a development support or oppose the project. While the literature offers several explanations about what shapes individuals’ perceptions of energy projects, few have considered the importance of cognitive heuristics and the law of contagion. Here, we employ a survey experiment on a nationally-representative sample of 2,000 respondents to test whether knowing which energy resources connect to a high-voltage transmission line dictate support for the line. Results reveal that information about the source of electricity is fundamentally important. If a transmission line is said to carry electricity from a solar and wind development, a respondent is significantly more likely to support development of the line. If the line instead is said to carry electricity from a natural gas or coal plant, respectively, respondents are significantly less likely to support it. This study has implications for energy infrastructure development, messaging, and public acceptance of energy projects."
https://openalex.org/W2959974431,"The aim of this study was to investigate the predictors of long-term clinical outcome of heart failure (HF) patients who survived first year after initiation of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).This was a single-center observational cohort study of CRT patients implanted because of symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction between 2005 and 2013. Left ventricle (LV) diameters and ejection fraction, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and level of N-terminal fragment of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were assessed at baseline and 12 months after CRT implantation. Their predictive power for long-term HF hospitalization and mortality, and cardiac and all-cause mortality was investigated.A total of 315 patients with left bundle branch block or intraventricular conduction delay who survived >1 year after CRT implantation were analyzed in the current study. During a follow-up period of 4.8±2.1 years from CRT implantation, 35.2% patients died from cardiac (19.3%) or non-cardiac (15.9%) causes. Post-CRT LV ejection fraction and LV end-systolic diameter (either 12-month value or the change from baseline) were equally predictive for clinical events. For NT-proBNP, however, the 12-month level was a stronger predictor than the change from baseline. Both reverse LV remodeling and 12-month level of NT-proBNP were independent and comparable predictors of CRT-related clinical outcome, while NT-proBNP response had the strongest association with all-cause mortality. When post-CRT relative change of LV end-systolic diameter and 12-month level of NT-proBNP (dichotomized at -12.3% and 1230 ng/L, respectively) were combined, subgroups of very-high and very-low risk patients were identified.The level of NT-proBNP and reverse LV remodeling at one year after CRT are independent and complementary predictors of future clinical events. Their combination may help to improve the risk stratification of CRT patients."
