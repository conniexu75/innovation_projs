https://openalex.org/W2595087345,"The human brain contains approximately 60 billion cerebellar granule cells, which outnumber all other brain neurons combined. Classical theories posit that a large, diverse population of granule cells allows for highly detailed representations of sensorimotor context, enabling downstream Purkinje cells to sense fine contextual changes. Although evidence suggests a role for the cerebellum in cognition, granule cells are known to encode only sensory and motor context. Here, using two-photon calcium imaging in behaving mice, we show that granule cells convey information about the expectation of reward. Mice initiated voluntary forelimb movements for delayed sugar-water reward. Some granule cells responded preferentially to reward or reward omission, whereas others selectively encoded reward anticipation. Reward responses were not restricted to forelimb movement, as a Pavlovian task evoked similar responses. Compared to predictable rewards, unexpected rewards elicited markedly different granule cell activity despite identical stimuli and licking responses. In both tasks, reward signals were widespread throughout multiple cerebellar lobules. Tracking the same granule cells over several days of learning revealed that cells with reward-anticipating responses emerged from those that responded at the start of learning to reward delivery, whereas reward-omission responses grew stronger as learning progressed. The discovery of predictive, non-sensorimotor encoding in granule cells is a major departure from the current understanding of these neurons and markedly enriches the contextual information available to postsynaptic Purkinje cells, with important implications for cognitive processing in the cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W2602561729,"Longden et al. demonstrate that brain capillaries function as a vast sensory web, monitoring neuronal activity by sensing K+ and translating this into a KIR-channel-mediated regenerative retrograde hyperpolarizing signal that propagates to upstream arterioles to drive vasodilation and an increase in blood flow into the capillary bed. Blood flow into the brain is dynamically regulated to satisfy the changing metabolic requirements of neurons, but how this is accomplished has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate a central role for capillary endothelial cells in sensing neural activity and communicating it to upstream arterioles in the form of an electrical vasodilatory signal. We further demonstrate that this signal is initiated by extracellular K+ —a byproduct of neural activity—which activates capillary endothelial cell inward-rectifier K+ (KIR2.1) channels to produce a rapidly propagating retrograde hyperpolarization that causes upstream arteriolar dilation, increasing blood flow into the capillary bed. Our results establish brain capillaries as an active sensory web that converts changes in external K+ into rapid, 'inside-out' electrical signaling to direct blood flow to active brain regions."

https://openalex.org/W2598373555,"Neural cultures derived from Huntington's disease (HD) patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells were used for 'omics' analyses to identify mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration. RNA-seq analysis identified genes in glutamate and GABA signaling, axonal guidance and calcium influx whose expression was decreased in HD cultures. One-third of gene changes were in pathways regulating neuronal development and maturation. When mapped to stages of mouse striatal development, the profiles aligned with earlier embryonic stages of neuronal differentiation. We observed a strong correlation between HD-related histone marks, gene expression and unique peak profiles associated with dysregulated genes, suggesting a coordinated epigenetic program. Treatment with isoxazole-9, which targets key dysregulated pathways, led to amelioration of expanded polyglutamine repeat-associated phenotypes in neural cells and of cognitive impairment and synaptic pathology in HD model R6/2 mice. These data suggest that mutant huntingtin impairs neurodevelopmental pathways that could disrupt synaptic homeostasis and increase vulnerability to the pathologic consequence of expanded polyglutamine repeats over time."
https://openalex.org/W2597662796,"Cerebellar granule cells, which constitute half the brain's neurons, supply Purkinje cells with contextual information necessary for motor learning, but how they encode this information is unknown. Here we show, using two-photon microscopy to track neural activity over multiple days of cerebellum-dependent eyeblink conditioning in mice, that granule cell populations acquire a dense representation of the anticipatory eyelid movement. Initially, granule cells responded to neutral visual and somatosensory stimuli as well as periorbital airpuffs used for training. As learning progressed, two-thirds of monitored granule cells acquired a conditional response whose timing matched or preceded the learned eyelid movements. Granule cell activity covaried trial by trial to form a redundant code. Many granule cells were also active during movements of nearby body structures. Thus, a predictive signal about the upcoming movement is widely available at the input stage of the cerebellar cortex, as required by forward models of cerebellar control."
https://openalex.org/W2595623140,"The enteric nervous system of jawed vertebrates arises primarily from vagal neural crest cells that migrate to the foregut and subsequently colonize and innervate the entire gastrointestinal tract. Here we examine development of the enteric nervous system in the basal jawless vertebrate the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) to gain insight into its evolutionary origin. Surprisingly, we find no evidence for the existence of a vagally derived enteric neural crest population in the lamprey. Rather, labelling with the lipophilic dye DiI shows that late-migrating cells, originating from the trunk neural tube and associated with nerve fibres, differentiate into neurons within the gut wall and typhlosole. We propose that these trunk-derived neural crest cells may be homologous to Schwann cell precursors, recently shown in mammalian embryos to populate post-embryonic parasympathetic ganglia, including enteric ganglia. Our results suggest that neural-crest-derived Schwann cell precursors made an important contribution to the ancient enteric nervous system of early jawless vertebrates, a role that was largely subsumed by vagal neural crest cells in early gnathostomes."
https://openalex.org/W2599638002,"Chemotherapy aided by opening of the blood-brain barrier with intra-arterial infusion of hyperosmolar mannitol improves the outcome in primary central nervous system lymphoma. Proper opening of the blood-brain barrier is crucial for the treatment, yet there are no means available for its real-time monitoring. The intact blood-brain barrier maintains a mV-level electrical potential difference between blood and brain tissue, giving rise to a measurable electrical signal at the scalp. Therefore, we used direct-current electroencephalography (DC-EEG) to characterize the spatiotemporal behavior of scalp-recorded slow electrical signals during blood-brain barrier opening. Nine anesthetized patients receiving chemotherapy were monitored continuously during 47 blood-brain barrier openings induced by carotid or vertebral artery mannitol infusion. Left or right carotid artery mannitol infusion generated a strongly lateralized DC-EEG response that began with a 2 min negative shift of up to 2000 μV followed by a positive shift lasting up to 20 min above the infused carotid artery territory, whereas contralateral responses were of opposite polarity. Vertebral artery mannitol infusion gave rise to a minimally lateralized and more uniformly distributed slow negative response with a posterior-frontal gradient. Simultaneously performed near-infrared spectroscopy detected a multiphasic response beginning with mannitol-bolus induced dilution of blood and ending in a prolonged increase in the oxy/deoxyhemoglobin ratio. The pronounced DC-EEG shifts are readily accounted for by opening and sealing of the blood-brain barrier. These data show that DC-EEG is a promising real-time monitoring tool for blood-brain barrier disruption augmented drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2600431307,"Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of bupropion in the treatment of apathy in Huntington’s disease (HD). Methods In this phase 2b multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, individuals with HD and clinical signs of apathy according to the Structured Clinical Interview for Apathy—Dementia (SCIA-D), but not depression (n = 40) were randomized to receive either bupropion 150/300mg or placebo daily for 10 weeks. The primary outcome parameter was a significant change of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) score after ten weeks of treatment as judged by an informant (AES-I) living in close proximity with the study participant. The secondary outcome parameters included changes of 1. AES scores determined by the patient (AES-S) or the clinical investigator (AES-C), 2. psychiatric symptoms (NPI, HADS-SIS, UHDRS-Behavior), 3. cognitive performance (SDMT, Stroop, VFT, MMSE), 4. motor symptoms (UHDRS-Motor), 5. activities of daily function (TFC, UHDRS-Function), and 6. caregiver distress (NPI-D). In addition, we investigated the effect of bupropion on brain structure as well as brain responses and functional connectivity during reward processing in a gambling task using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results At baseline, there were no significant treatment group differences in the clinical primary and secondary outcome parameters. At endpoint, there was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups for all clinical primary and secondary outcome variables. Study participation, irrespective of the intervention, lessened symptoms of apathy according to the informant and the clinical investigator. Conclusion Bupropion does not alleviate apathy in HD. However, study participation/placebo effects were observed, which document the need for carefully controlled trials when investigating therapeutic interventions for the neuropsychiatric symptoms of HD.

https://openalex.org/W2607653182,"Whole-genome re-sequencing, alignment and annotation analyses were undertaken for 12 sires representing four important cattle breeds in Brazil: Guzerat (multi-purpose), Gyr, Girolando and Holstein (dairy production). A total of approximately 4.3 billion reads from an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer generated for each animal 10.7 to 16.4-fold genome coverage. A total of 27,441,279 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 3,828,041 insertions/deletions (InDels) were detected in the samples, of which 2,557,670 SNVs and 883,219 InDels were novel. The submission of these genetic variants to the dbSNP database significantly increased the number of known variants, particularly for the indicine genome. The concordance rate between genotypes obtained using the Bovine HD BeadChip array and the same variants identified by sequencing was about 99.05%. The annotation of variants identified numerous non-synonymous SNVs and frameshift InDels which could affect phenotypic variation. Functional enrichment analysis was performed and revealed that variants in the olfactory transduction pathway was over represented in all four cattle breeds, while the ECM-receptor interaction pathway was over represented in Girolando and Guzerat breeds, the ABC transporters pathway was over represented only in Holstein breed, and the metabolic pathways was over represented only in Gyr breed. The genetic variants discovered here provide a rich resource to help identify potential genomic markers and their associated molecular mechanisms that impact economically important traits for Gyr, Girolando, Guzerat and Holstein breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2601242398,"In the asexual stages, Toxoplasma gondii stage converts between acute phase rapidly replicating tachyzoites and chronic phase slowly dividing bradyzoites. Correspondingly, T. gondii differentially expresses two distinct genes and isoforms of the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, expressing LDH1 exclusively in the tachyzoite stage and LDH2 preferentially in the bradyzoite stage. LDH catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate in anaerobic growth conditions and is utilized for energy supply, however, the precise role of LDH1 and LDH2 in parasite biology in the asexual stages is still unclear. Here, we investigated the biological role of LDH1 and LDH2 in the asexual stages, and the vaccine strain potential of deletion mutants lacking LDH1, LDH2, or both genes (Δldh1, Δldh2 and Δldh1/2). Deletion of LDH1 reduced acute parasite virulence, impaired bradyzoite differentiation in vitro, and markedly reduced chronic stage cyst burdens in vivo. In contrast, deletion of LDH2 impaired chronic stage cyst burdens without affecting virulence or bradyzoite differentiation. Deletion of both LDH1 and LDH2 induced a more severe defect in chronic stage cyst burdens. These LDH mutant phenotypes were not associated with any growth defect. Vaccination of mice with a low dose of mutants deleted for LDH elicited effective protective immunity to lethal challenge infection, demonstrating the vaccine potential of LDH deletion mutants. These results suggest that lactate dehydrogenase in T. gondii controls virulence, bradyzoite differentiation, and chronic infection and reveals the potential of LDH mutants as vaccine strains."
https://openalex.org/W2598604814,"Japan has been known as a low HIV-prevalence country with a concentrated epidemic among high-risk groups. However, it has not been determined whether Japan meets the 90-90-90 goals set by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)/World Health Organization (WHO). Moreover, to date, the HIV care cascade has not been examined. We estimated the total number of diagnosed people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) (n = 22,840) based on legal reports to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare by subtracting the number of foreigners who left Japan (n = 2,273) and deaths (n = 2,321) from the cumulative diagnosis report (n = 27,434). The number of total undiagnosed PLWHA was estimated by age and sex specific HIV-positive rates observed among first-time blood donors between 2011–2015 in Japan. Our estimates show that 14.4% (n = 3,830) of all PLWHA (n = 26,670) were undiagnosed in Japan at the end of 2015. The number of patients retained in care (n = 20,615: 77.3% of PLWHA), the percentage of those on antiretroviral therapy (n = 18,921: 70.9% of PLWHA) and those with suppressed viral loads (<200 copies/mL; n = 18,756: 70.3% of PLWHA) were obtained through a questionnaire survey conducted in the AIDS Core Hospitals throughout the country. According to these estimates, Japan failed to achieve the first two of the three UNAIDS/WHO targets (22,840/26,670 = 85.6% of HIV-positive cases were diagnosed; 18,921/22,840 = 82.8% of those diagnosed were treated; 18,756/18,921 = 99.1% of those treated experienced viral suppression). Although the antiretroviral treatment uptake and success after retention in medical care appears to be excellent in Japan, there are unmet needs, mainly at the surveillance level before patients are retained in care. The promotion of HIV testing and treatment programs among the key affected populations (especially men who have sex with men) may contribute to further decreasing the HIV epidemic and achieving the UNAIDS/WHO targets in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2601179977,"The natural sex reversal severely affects the sex ratio and thus decreases the productivity of the rice field eel (Monopterus albus). How to understand and manipulate this process is one of the major issues for the rice field eel stocking. So far the genomics and transcriptomics data available for this species are still scarce. Here we provide a comprehensive study of transcriptomes of brain and gonad tissue in three sex stages (female, intersex and male) from the rice field eel to investigate changes in transcriptional level during the sex reversal process.Approximately 195 thousand unigenes were generated and over 44.4 thousand were functionally annotated. Comparative study between stages provided multiple differentially expressed genes in brain and gonad tissue. Overall 4668 genes were found to be of unequal abundance between gonad tissues, far more than that of the brain tissues (59 genes). These genes were enriched in several different signaling pathways. A number of 231 genes were found with different levels in gonad in each stage, with several reproduction-related genes included. A total of 19 candidate genes that could be most related to sex reversal were screened out, part of these genes' expression patterns were validated by RT-qPCR. The expression of spef2, maats1, spag6 and dmc1 were abundant in testis, but was barely detected in females, while the 17β-hsd12, zpsbp3, gal3 and foxn5 were only expressed in ovary.This study investigated the complexity of brain and gonad transcriptomes in three sex stages of the rice field eel. Integrated analysis of different gene expression and changes in signaling pathways, such as PI3K-Akt pathway, provided crucial data for further study of sex transformation mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2598298188,"Ceramide and more complex sphingolipids constitute a diverse group of lipids that serve important roles as structural entities of biological membranes and as regulators of cellular growth, differentiation, and development. Thus, ceramides are vital players in numerous diseases including metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, as well as neurological disorders. Here we show that acyl-coenzyme A-binding protein (ACBP) potently facilitates very-long acyl chain ceramide synthesis. ACBP increases the activity of ceramide synthase 2 (CerS2) by more than 2-fold and CerS3 activity by 7-fold. ACBP binds very-long-chain acyl-CoA esters, which is required for its ability to stimulate CerS activity. We also show that high-speed liver cytosol from wild-type mice activates CerS3 activity, whereas cytosol from ACBP knock-out mice does not. Consistently, CerS2 and CerS3 activities are significantly reduced in the testes of ACBP−/− mice, concomitant with a significant reduction in long- and very-long-chain ceramide levels. Importantly, we show that ACBP interacts with CerS2 and CerS3. Our data uncover a novel mode of regulation of very-long acyl chain ceramide synthesis by ACBP, which we anticipate is of crucial importance in understanding the regulation of ceramide metabolism in pathogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2600234877,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is produced endogenously in vivo and has multiple effects on signaling pathways and cell function. Mitochondria can be both an H2S source and sink, and many of the biological effects of H2S relate to its interactions with mitochondria. However, the significance of mitochondrial H2S is uncertain, in part due to the difficulty of assessing changes in its concentration in vivo Although a number of fluorescent H2S probes have been developed these are best suited to cells in culture and cannot be used in vivo To address this unmet need we have developed a mitochondria-targeted H2S probe, MitoA, which can be used to assess relative changes in mitochondrial H2S levels in vivo MitoA comprises a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation coupled to an aryl azide. The TPP cation leads to the accumulation of MitoA inside mitochondria within tissues in vivo There, the aryl azido group reacts with H2S to form an aryl amine (MitoN). The extent of conversion of MitoA to MitoN thus gives an indication of the levels of mitochondrial H2S in vivo Both compounds can be detected sensitively by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of the tissues, and quantified relative to deuterated internal standards. Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of MitoA and show that it can be used to assess changes in mitochondrial H2S levels in vivo As a proof of principle we used MitoA to show that H2S levels increase in vivo during myocardial ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2601512469,"Polls examining public opinion on the subject of climate change are now commonplace, and one-off public opinion polls provide a snapshot of citizen's opinions that can inform policy and communication strategies. However, cross-sectional polls do not track opinions over time, thus making it impossible to ascertain whether key climate change beliefs held by the same group of individuals are changing or not. Here we examine the extent to which individual's level of agreement with two key beliefs (""climate change is real"" and ""climate change is caused by humans"") remain stable or increase/decrease over a six-year period in New Zealand using latent growth curve modelling (n = 10,436). Data were drawn from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, a probabilistic national panel study, and indicated that levels of agreement to both beliefs have steadily increased over the 2009–2015 period. Given that climate change beliefs and concerns are key predictors of climate change action, our findings suggest that a combination of targeted endeavors, as well as serendipitous events, may successfully convey the emergency of the issue."
https://openalex.org/W2602660447,"Background Risk of natalizumab-related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is associated with the presence of anti-JC-virus (JCV) antibodies. Objective To investigate the longitudinal evolution of anti-JCV antibody index and to determine the predictive value of baseline anti-JCV antibody index for long-term stability of anti-JCV antibody status. Methods MS patients from the MS centre of Medical University of Innsbruck, who had serum sampling for a time period of 4–6 years at intervals of 6±3 months, were included in this retrospective, longitudinal study. Anti-JCV antibody serological status and index were determined by 2-step second-generation anti-JCV antibody assay. Results 154 patients were included in this study. Median follow-up time was 63.7 months, with median 11 samples available per patient. At baseline, 111 (72.1%) patients were anti-JCV antibody positive. Baseline anti-JCV antibody index significantly correlated with age (R = 0.22, p = 0.005); there was no difference with respect to sex, disease duration or previously used disease-modifying treatment. During follow-up anti-JCV antibody status changed from negative to positive or vice versa in 17% of patients. In seronegative patients at baseline, baseline anti-JCV antibody index was significantly lower in those remaining seronegative at follow-up compared to those converting to seropositivity (median 0.16 vs. 0.24, p = 0.002). In seropositive patients at baseline, index was higher in those remaining seropositive compared to those reverting to seronegativity (2.6 vs. 0.45, p<10−7). Baseline anti-JCV antibody index >0.90 predicted stable positive serostatus (sensitivity 88.7%, specificity 96.5%) and <0.20 stable negative serostatus (sensitivity 61.3%, specificity 97.6%). Conclusions Anti-JCV antibody index remained relatively stable over 6-year follow-up with annual serostatus change of ~3%. Baseline anti-JCV antibody index predicted stable negative and stable positive JCV serostatus."

Recently, endocannabinoids have been implicated in cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms involving endocannabinoid signaling, glucose uptake, and IR in cardiomyocytes are understudied. Here we report that the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), via stimulation of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase β, activates AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), leading to increased glucose uptake. Interestingly, we have observed that the mRNA expression of CB1 and CB2 receptors was decreased in diabetic mice, indicating reduced endocannabinoid signaling in the diabetic heart. We further establish that TNFα induces IR in cardiomyocytes. Treatment with 2-AG suppresses TNFα-induced proinflammatory markers and improves IR and glucose uptake. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of AMPK attenuates the anti-inflammatory effect and reversal of IR elicited by 2-AG. Additionally, in human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes challenged with TNFα or FFA, we demonstrate that 2-AG improves insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake.

https://openalex.org/W2602131064,"In recent years there has been much interest in investigating the social structure of group living animals using social network analysis. Many studies so far have focused on the social networks of adults, often excluding younger, immature group members. This potentially may lead to a biased view of group social structure as multiple recent studies have shown that younger group members can significantly contribute to group structure. As proof of the concept, we address this issue by investigating social network structure with and without juveniles in wild olive baboons (Papio anubis) at Gashaka Gumti National Park, Nigeria. Two social networks including all independently moving individuals (i.e., excluding dependent juveniles) were created based on aggressive and grooming behaviour. We used knockout simulations based on the random removal of individuals from the network in order to investigate to what extent the exclusion of juveniles affects the resulting network structure and our interpretation of age-sex specific social roles. We found that juvenile social patterns differed from those of adults and that the exclusion of juveniles from the network significantly altered the resulting overall network structure. Moreover, the removal of juveniles from the network affected individuals in specific age-sex classes differently: for example, including juveniles in the grooming network increased network centrality of adult females while decreasing centrality of adult males. These results suggest that excluding juveniles from the analysis may not only result in a distorted picture of the overall social structure but also may mask some of the social roles of individuals belonging to different age-sex classes."

Natural variations in the patterns, noise, and artefacts affect the evaluation accuracy as well as experts' agreement. The knowledge of predictive posterior distribution allows experts to estimate confidence intervals within which decisions are distributed. Bayesian approach to probabilistic inference has provided accurate estimates of intervals of interest. In this paper we propose a new feature extraction technique for Bayesian assessment and estimation of predictive distribution in a case of newborn brain development assessment. The new EEG features are verified within the Bayesian framework on a large EEG data set including 1,100 recordings made from newborns in 10 age groups. The proposed features are highly correlated with brain maturation and their use increases the assessment accuracy."

To examine the roles of autophagy in cellular metabolism, we generated autophagy-defective (atg) mutants in the X2180-1B strain background. We compared the growth of wild-type (WT) and atg cells in minimal (synthetic dextrose, SD) and rich (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose, YEPD) medium, and we found that mutations in the core autophagy machinery result in defects in the diauxic shift, the transition from fermentation to respiratory growth upon glucose depletion, specifically in SD. Furthermore, we confirmed that autophagy was induced prior to the diauxic shift, implying that it plays a role in this process. In YEPD, atg mutants grew normally, so we assumed that the insufficiency of certain nutrients in SD was responsible for the defects. We ultimately identified iron, which is a necessary cofactor for respiratory activity, as the nutrient required for the diauxic shift in atg mutants. Indeed, atg mutants exhibited defects in respiration, which was rescued by supplementation with iron. Based on these data, we hypothesized that autophagy is involved in iron recycling during the diauxic shift. smf3Δfet5Δ or smf3Δftr1Δ cells, which are unable to export iron from the vacuole, also exhibit defects in the diauxic shift, so iron released from the vacuole is important for the shift in SD medium.

The purposes of this study were to assess the ability of ASL imaging to detect crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) in patients with their first unilateral supratentorial hyperacute stroke and to identify imaging or clinical factors significantly associated with CCD.We reviewed 204 consecutive patients who underwent MRI less than 8 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms. The inclusion criteria were supratentorial abnormality in diffusion-weighted images in the absence of a cerebellar or brain stem lesion, bilateral supratentorial infarction, subacute or chronic infarction, and MR angiography showing vertebrobasilar system disease. For qualitative analysis, asymmetric cerebellar hypoperfusion in ASL images was categorized into 3 grades. Quantitative analysis was performed to calculate the asymmetric index (AI). The patients' demographic and clinical features and outcomes were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were also performed.A total of 32 patients met the inclusion criteria, and 24 (75%) presented CCD. Univariate analyses revealed more frequent arterial occlusions, higher diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion volumes and higher initial NIHSS and mRS scores in the CCD-positive group compared with the CCD-negative group (all p < .05). The presence of arterial occlusion and the initial mRS scores were related with the AI (all p < .05). Multivariate analyses revealed that arterial occlusion and the initial mRS scores were significantly associated with CCD and AI.ASL imaging could detect CCD in 75% of patients with hyperacute infarction. We found that CCD was more prevalent in patients with arterial occlusion, larger ischemic brain volumes, and higher initial NIHSS and mRS scores. In particular, vessel occlusion and initial mRS score appeared to be significantly related with CCD pathophysiology in the hyperacute stage."

Transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 (RacET) develop an age-dependent phenotype with atrial dilatation, fibrosis, and atrial fibrillation. Expression of MR was similar in RacET and WT mice. The expression of 11β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) was age-dependently up-regulated in the atria and the left ventricles of RacET mice on mRNA and protein levels. Statin treatment inhibiting Rac1 geranylgeranylation reduced 11β-HSD2 up-regulation. Samples of human left atrial myocardium showed a positive correlation between Rac1 activity and 11β-HSD2 expression (r = 0.7169). Immunoprecipitation showed enhanced Rac1-bound 11β-HSD2 relative to Rac1 expression in RacET mice that was diminished with statin treatment. Both basal and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced NADPH oxidase activity were increased in RacET and correlated positively with 11β-HSD2 expression (r = 0.788 and r = 0.843, respectively). In cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes, Rac1 activation with l-buthionine sulfoximine increased; Rac1 inhibition with NSC23766 decreased 11β-HSD2 mRNA and protein expression. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) up-regulation induced by aldosterone was prevented with NSC23766. Cardiomyocyte transfection with 11β-HSD2 siRNA abolished the aldosterone-induced CTGF up-regulation. Aldosterone-stimulated MR nuclear translocation was blocked by the 11β-HSD2 inhibitor carbenoxolone. In cardiac fibroblasts, nuclear MR translocation induced by aldosterone was inhibited with NSC23766 and spironolactone. NSC23766 prevented the aldosterone-induced proliferation and migration of cardiac fibroblasts and the up-regulation of CTGF and fibronectin. In conclusion, Rac1 GTPase regulates 11β-HSD2 expression, MR activation, and MR-mediated pro-fibrotic signaling."

We find that the helical TM5i conformation is associated with a higher propensity for Na2 release, which leads to the repositioning of the N terminus and transition to an inward-open state. By using comparative interaction network analysis, we also identify allosteric pathways connecting TM5i and the Na2 binding site to the extracellular and intracellular regions. Based on our combined computational and mutagenesis studies of MhsT and LeuT, we propose that TM5i plays a key role in Na2 binding and release associated with the conformational transition toward the inward-open state, a role that is likely to be shared across the NSS family.

Two crystal structures of another prokaryotic NSS homolog, the multihydrophobic amino acid transporter (MhsT) from Bacillus halodurans, have also been resolved (15Malinauskaite L. Quick M.

One was obtained using a high lipid-detergent mix (HiLiDe) and another with lipid-cubic-phase crystallization (LCP) (MhsTHiLiDe and MhsTLCP; PDB codes 4US3 and 4US4, respectively). Both structures are bound with a substrate l-tryptophan in the central substrate binding (S1) site and two sodium ions (Na+) in the nearby Na1 and Na2 sites, similar to LeuT structures. However, in these two MhsT structures, the extracellular vestibule is in a closed state similar to the inward-open LeuT structure (PDB code 3TT3), whereas the intracellular portion of TM5 (TM5i; see “Experimental procedures” for the definition of intracellular, middle, and extracellular subsegments) is in either an unwound or a helical (structured) configuration. These structures thus present transporter states that have not been identified in the multiple LeuT structures that have been solved to date. In the outward-facing crystal structures of LeuT (PDB codes 3TT1 and 2A65), the Na2 site is formed by residues from TM1 and TM8; the Na2 (the Na+ bound in the Na2 site) coordination is trigonal-bipyramidal; and bound Na2 does not have direct access to water (3Singh S.K.

Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the crystal structures of MhsT, dDAT, and hSERT, the Na2 coordination is octahedral, with the sixth ligand being a water molecule in close vicinity to TM5i. Of note, in the MhsTHiLiDe structure with the unwound TM5i, there is a continuous water pathway from the Na2 site to the intracellular milieu, and we proposed that the unwinding and flexibility of TM5i facilitates the formation of such a solvation pathway in a step prior to full inward opening of the transporter (15Malinauskaite L. Quick M. Reinhard L. Lyons J.A. Yano H. Javitch J.A. Nissen P. A mechanism for intracellular release of Na by neurotransmitter/sodium symporters.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 1006-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, simulations of dDAT and a hDAT homology model (16Khelashvili G. Stanley N. Sahai M.A. Medina J. LeVine M.V. Shi L. De Fabritiis G. Weinstein H. Spontaneous inward opening of the dopamine transporter is triggered by PIP2-regulated dynamics of the N-terminus.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2015; 6: 1825-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and of MhsTLCP (see “Results”) indicate that such a water pathway can readily form with a helical TM5i. In addition, the absence of the N terminus (NT) in MhsTLCP but not MhsTHiLiDe suggests that the dynamics of the NT may be coupled to that of TM5, which is in direct contact with the NT. A detailed analysis of the mechanism of Na2 release is therefore warranted, with a focus on the coordinated rearrangements of TM5 and the NT in such a mechanism. In the structures of ApcT (17Shaffer P.L. Goehring A. Shankaranarayanan A. Gouaux E. Structure and mechanism of a Na+-independent amino acid transporter.Science. 2009; 325: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) from the amino acid-polyamine-organocation transporter family and in the structures of BetP (18Ressl S. Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C. Vonrhein C. Ott V. Ziegler C. Molecular basis of transport and regulation in the Na+/betaine symporter BetP.Nature. 2009; 458: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) from the BCCT family, both of which share the LeuT-fold, TM5i also contributes to the aligned Na2 sites. In particular, the protonation and deprotonation of Lys-158 in TM5 of ApcT, in which the role of Na+ is replaced by a proton, is believed to mimic Na+ binding and dissociation, respectively (17Shaffer P.L. Goehring A. Shankaranarayanan A. Gouaux E. Structure and mechanism of a Na+-independent amino acid transporter.Science. 2009; 325: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed how Na+ or proton binding couples to the transport process by analyzing the results of comparative MD simulations of LeuT and ApcT: specifically, we identified a lead role of TM1i in coordination with TM5i in the transition to an inward-open conformation, when the Na2 site is neither occupied by Na+ nor positively charged (19Shi L. Weinstein H. Conformational Rearrangements to the Intracellular open states of the LeuT and ApcT transporters are modulated by common mechanisms.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: L103-L105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Based on our homology modeling of DAT and SERT (19Shi L. Weinstein H. Conformational Rearrangements to the Intracellular open states of the LeuT and ApcT transporters are modulated by common mechanisms.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: L103-L105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we predicted that a conserved Thr from TM5i makes an H-bond interaction with a conserved Na2-coordinating Asp from TM8, and this interaction is likely involved in the reconfiguration of the Na2 site associated with binding and dissociation of Na+. This predicted H-bond was later confirmed by the dDAT and hSERT structures with Na2 bound (e.g. PDB codes 4M48 for dDAT and 5I71 for hSERT) (10Penmatsa A. Wang K.H. Gouaux E. X-ray structure of dopamine transporter elucidates antidepressant mechanism.Nature. 2013; 503: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 13Coleman J.A. Green E.M. Gouaux E. X-ray structures and mechanism of the human serotonin transporter.Nature. 2016; 532: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the MhsTLCP structure, Asn-176 from TM5i, which is one turn above Thr-269 in hDAT but is conserved in bacterial NSS except for LeuT (see the sequence alignment in Fig. 1), is in close vicinity to Ser-323 (the Na2 coordinating residue that aligns to Asp-421 in hDAT), whereas in the MhsTHiLiDe structure, Asn-176 faces outwards. The potential involvement of TM5i in Na2 binding and exit suggests that it may play a role in coordinating intracellular conformational changes in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic NSSs. In this study, using molecular dynamics and energy calculations, we investigate the role of TM5 in these Na+-coupled conformational transitions. Using the LeuT structures as references, we compared the degree of open versus occluded character between the MhsT and LeuT structures and between the two MhsT structures (MhsTHiLiDe and MhsTLCP). For each comparison, we evaluated the structural differences by measuring distances among the ends of TMs on either the extracellular or intracellular side (see “Experimental procedures”). Unlike our previous comparison, which relied upon a structural superposition to identify the relative rearrangements of TMs, the current analysis focused on direct measurements of openness. On the extracellular side, the three LeuT structures in outward-open (PDB code 3TT1), outward-occluded (PDB code 2A65), and inward-open (PDB code 3TT3) states, which will be referred to as LeuTOO, LeuTOC, LeuTIO below, clearly present three different levels of openness (Figure 2, Figure 3). With respect to these structures, MhsTHiLiDe and MhsTLCP, which are similarly occluded on the extracellular side, can be considered as intermediates between LeuTOC and LeuTIO (Fig. 3). These intermediates are much more similar to LeuTIO than to LeuTOC, yet remain slightly more open than LeuTIO near the extracellular portion of TM10 (TM10e). On the intracellular side, MhsTHiLiDe is similarly occluded as LeuTOO and LeuTOC, with the exception of the unwinding of the TM5i region that opens a water tunnel to the Na2 site (15Malinauskaite L. Quick M. Reinhard L. Lyons J.A. Yano H. Javitch J.A. Nissen P. A mechanism for intracellular release of Na by neurotransmitter/sodium symporters.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 1006-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The intracellular gating network surrounding Tyr-245 (which aligns to Tyr-268 of LeuT) is in the same configuration as in LeuTOO/LeuTOC, e.g. the backbone atoms of Tyr-245 and Trp-12 interact directly, just like Tyr-268 and Trp-8 in LeuTOO/LeuTOC. In contrast, MhsTLCP, in which TM1i is slightly more tilted toward the membrane, is more inward-facing than MhsTHiLiDe and opens at a region that has been implicated as the substrate permeation pathway (20Zhao Y. Terry D. Shi L. Weinstein H. Blanchard S.C. Javitch J.A. Single-molecule dynamics of gating in a neurotransmitter transporter homologue.Nature. 2010; 465: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) (circle in Fig. 2C). This difference between the two MhsT structures results from the altered conformational coupling between TM5i-IL2 and TM1i-NT, which is propagated to the ends of the other TMs (Fig. 2C). Taken together, the findings show that MhsTHiLiDe and MhsTLCP are similarly occluded on the extracellular side, whereas on the intracellular side MhsTLCP is more open than MhsTHiLiDe (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we propose that the MhsTHiLiDe represents an earlier intermediate and MhsTLCP represents a later intermediate in the transport cycle that leads to full inward opening (Fig. 3B, and see below). To investigate the different impacts that the unwound and structured conformations of TM5i have on the dynamics of the transporter, we carried out both conventional (cMD) and replica-exchange molecular dynamics (reMD) simulations in an explicit lipid bilayer environment. To differentiate the simulation results obtained by starting from the different crystal structures, we refer to the simulated conditions as MhsTU (where U indicates unwound TM5i) and MhsTS (where S indicates structured/helical TM5i), which start from the MhsTHiLiDe and MhsTLCP structures, respectively. Because the NT was not resolved in the MhsTLCP structure, we started the MhsTS simulations from a model of the MhsTLCP structure in which the NT was built according to the MhsTHiLiDe structure (see “Experimental procedures” and Table 1).Table 1List of cMD trajectoriesConditionNumber of replicasTotal simulation timeNsMhsTU23000MhsTS and MhsTifS610,200Total813,200 Open table in a new tab In our prolonged cMD simulations (Table 1), we observed that the Na+ ion can gradually dissociate from the Na2 binding site in the MhsTS state (3 of 5 simulations; Fig. 4), whereas in the MhsTU state, it always remains stably bound. In the simulations in which Na2 dissociates from its binding site, TM1i consistently swings out toward the lipids, so that the MhsT transitions into an inward-facing conformational state (MhsTifS), which emerged from our hierarchical clustering analysis (see “Experimental procedures”). The dynamics of such a transition are revealed by the principal component analyses (PCA) we performed on the MhsTU, MhsTS, and MhsTifS simulation trajectories (Fig. 5): along the first dominant principal component of the MhsTifS simulations (shown as blue arrows in Fig. 5C), a helical TM5i rearranges so that TM1i can dissociate from the TM domain. Such remarkable conformational changes are not observed in any PCA eigenmode of the Na2-bound MhsTU and MhsTS simulations (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that the impact of the TM5i conformation on the overall transporter conformation is tightly associated with Na2 binding and unbinding. Interestingly, the helical or unwound TM5i conformations result in the polar Asn-176 of TM5i facing either toward the protein interior or the lipid membrane, respectively. We propose that Asn-176 plays an important role in Na2 dissociation (Figure 4, Figure 7) by destabilizing Na2 binding when it faces the Na2 site: when Na2 is bound in the MhsTS state, Asn-176 is in close proximity and forms interactions with Na2 through one or two water molecules; it may also transiently form an H-bond with the side chain of the Na2-coordinating residue Ser-323 in TM8, which may facilitate its rotation away from Na2. Notably, when Na2 leaves its site, an H-bond between Ser-323 and Asn-176 is stably formed (see Fig. 7D). Similarly, in our reMD simulations (24 replicas each; Table 2), Na2 dissociates from its binding site in seven replicas in MhsTS (and significantly weakens its binding in many others), but Na2 is always stably bound in the MhsTU state (Fig. 4B). Furthermore the reMD revealed a similar role of the dynamics of Asn-176 and its stable interaction with Ser-323 after Na2 dissociation, as observed in the cMD simulations.Figure 5Intracellular release of Na2 is associated with overall conformational changes of TM1i and TM5i. Representative conformations of the MhsTU (A), MhsTS (B), and MhsTS-to-MhsTifS (C) simulations are shown as gray ribbons and distinguished by different colors for the NT/TM1i and TM5i/TM5m regions; the Trp substrate is rendered as sticks, and the Na1 and Na2 ions are shown as yellow spheres; in the MhsTifS state (C) Na2 has left its binding site. These conformations are overlaid with blue arrows indicating the first principal components of each simulation set (see “Experimental procedures”). For a qualitative comparison between the three principal components, the lengths of these arrows (and thus of the first principle components) are scaled by the total dynamic content (∑λi, with eigenvalues λi) of the MhsTU simulations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Conformational changes associated with the intracellular release of Na2.

To this end, we alchemically transformed the bound Na+ in the Na2 site into a water molecule. Indeed, the energy of this transformation is 106.2 ± 2.0 kcal/mol in the MhsTU state, ∼5 kcal/mol higher than that in the MhsTS state (101.7 ± 1.8 kcal/mol). In addition, we calculated the energy of the transformation in the MhsTS state when Ser-323 rotates away from the Na2 site to transiently form an H-bond with Asn-176 and found the Na2 affinity to be decreased by an additional ∼5 kcal/mol (94.9 ± 2.6 kcal/mol). Taken together, our results indicate that the TM5i conformation and intracellular Na2 dissociation are coupled to a conformational transition of the transporter to an inward-facing state. We next pursued a systematic characterization of how molecular changes related to the different TM5i conformations can allosterically propagate throughout the entire transporter via an intramolecular interaction network. To this end, we applied the pairwise interaction analysis (PIA) approach adapted from our previous study on allosteric propagation in LeuT (21Stolzenberg S. Quick M. Zhao C. Gotfryd K. Khelashvili G. Gether U. Loland C.J. Javitch J.A. Noskov S. Weinstein H. Shi L. Mechanism of the association between Na+ binding and conformations at the intracellular gate in neurotransmitter:sodium symporters.J.

Computational approaches to detect allosteric pathways in transmembrane molecular machines.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1858: 1652-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PIA detects pairwise interactions between molecular components, at either the atomic, residue, or subsegment level throughout the entire protein, which are significantly affected by a perturbation—in this case the unwound versus helical conformation of TM5i. The identities of the affected interactions are then used to assemble networks that form coherent pathways. At the subsegment level, our analysis revealed coordinated rearrangements in the form of heterogeneous interaction changes as a consequence of the different TM5i conformations. As shown in Figure 6, Figure 7, the significant changes in the interaction network originate from the TM5i and TM5m regions pivoting around Pro-181 and propagate to the NT, TM1i, IL2, TM6i, and IL3 regions on the intracellular side and to the TM1e, TM10e, and EL4b regions on the extracellular side. In the MhsTifS state, the absence of Na2 leads to the dissociation of the NT from the TM domain and a drastic outward tilting of TM1i on the intracellular side, the impact of which propagates to TM1m and TM1e (Figs. 6B and 7, C and F); such changes result in a much more inward-facing conformation than the MhsTHiLiDe and MhsTLCP structures, with TM1i tilted to a similar extent to that observed in the LeuTIO state (Fig. 8).Figure 8MhsTifS is an inward-facing state. In A and B, the ends of the transmembrane segments on the intracellular (A) and extracellular (B) sides are connected with edges colored coded to indicate significant distance differences between the simulated MhsTifS state and the MhsTHiLiDe structure. The representations and color scheme are the same as Fig. 2. C demonstrates that the TM1i in the MhsTifS swings out and tilts toward lipids in a similar extent as observed in the LeuTIO structure (PDB code 3TT3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At the residue level, by comparing the simulation results of the MhsTU and MhsTS states, we found on the intracellular side that the rearrangement of TM5i triggers reconfiguration of the packing between Trp-12 of the NT, Phe-18 of TM1i, and Tyr-242 and Tyr-245 of TM6i (Fig. 7, C and F). Trp-12, Phe-18, and Tyr-245 are highly conserved among NSSs, and the residues aligned to Tyr-245 in LeuT and DAT had been found to play a critical role in intracellular gating (21Stolzenberg S.

Compared with the stable interactions in this aromatic cluster seen in the MhsTU state, a reconfiguration of this cluster in MhsTS weakens the association between the NT and TM domain (Figure 6, Figure 7). Thus, consistent with the MhsTLCP structure in which the NT was not resolved, our simulation results revealed a highly flexible NT in the MhsTS condition.

https://openalex.org/W2602115013,"γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and disturbances in the GABAergic system have been implicated in numerous neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. The GABAB receptor is a heterodimeric class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) consisting of GABAB1a/b and GABAB2 subunits. Two GABAB receptor ligand binding sites have been described, namely the orthosteric GABA binding site located in the extracellular GABAB1 Venus fly trap domain and the allosteric binding site found in the GABAB2 transmembrane domain. To date, the only experimentally solved three-dimensional structures of the GABAB receptor are of the Venus fly trap domain. GABAB receptor allosteric modulators, however, show great therapeutic potential, and elucidating the structure of the GABAB2 transmembrane domain may lead to development of novel drugs and increased understanding of the allosteric mechanism of action. Despite the lack of x-ray crystal structures of the GABAB2 transmembrane domain, multiple crystal structures belonging to other classes of GPCRs than class A have been released within the last years. More closely related template structures are now available for homology modelling of the GABAB receptor. Here, multiple homology models of the GABAB2 subunit of the GABAB receptor have been constructed using templates from class A, B and C GPCRs, and docking of five clusters of positive allosteric modulators and decoys has been undertaken to select models that enrich the active compounds. Using this ligand-guided approach, eight GABAB2 homology models have been chosen as possible structural representatives of the transmembrane domain of the GABAB2 subunit. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to describe homology modelling of the transmembrane domain of the GABAB2 subunit and the docking of positive allosteric modulators in the receptor."

Although IRS-1 and IRS-2 share significant homology, they regulate distinct cellular responses downstream of these receptors and play divergent roles in breast cancer. To investigate the mechanism by which signaling through IRS-1 and IRS-2 results in differential outcomes, we assessed the involvement of the microtubule cytoskeleton in IRS-dependent signaling. Treatment with drugs that either stabilize or disrupt microtubules reveal that an intact microtubule cytoskeleton contributes to IRS-2- but not IRS-1-mediated activation of AKT by IGF-1.

In contrast to IRS-1, IRS-2 is absent from the nucleus in normal breast and breast tumors and is expressed either in the cytoplasm or at the cell membrane (13Clark J.L. Dresser K. Hsieh C.C. Sabel M. Kleer C.G. Khan A. Shaw L.M. Membrane localization of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) is associated with decreased overall survival in breast cancer.Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2011; 130: 759-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Diffuse cytoplasmic IRS-2 staining is associated with better overall survival of breast cancer patients, whereas membrane localization of IRS-2 in breast tumors is associated with decreased overall survival, particularly in patients with progesterone receptor-negative tumors (13Clark J.L. Dresser K. Hsieh C.C. Sabel M. Kleer C.G. Khan A. Shaw L.M.

The localization pattern of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in human tumors suggests that their trafficking to distinct subcellular compartments contributes to their ability to elicit unique signaling responses. However, the mechanism by which the intracellular localization of IRS-1 and IRS-2 is determined is not known. The microtubule cytoskeleton, which plays an important role in intracellular trafficking, has been implicated in insulin-dependent regulation of glucose uptake, and this role for microtubules occurs distal to IRS phosphorylation (20Olson A.L.

These observations support a role for microtubules in IRS-mediated downstream signaling, potentially through targeting of these adaptor proteins to unique subcellular compartments. We examined the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton in determining differential signaling and functional outcomes for IRS-1 and IRS-2. The data we obtained in this study reveal that IRS-2 co-localizes with microtubules and that the microtubule cytoskeleton contributes to IRS-2- but not IRS-1-dependent signaling to AKT. The differential involvement of the microtubule cytoskeleton in IRS-1- and IRS-2-mediated AKT signaling influences the apoptotic sensitivity of breast carcinoma cells to microtubule-disrupting drugs. To investigate the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton in IRS-dependent IGF-1R signaling, MDA-MB-231 cells were stimulated with IGF-1 after short-term (30 min to 1 h) treatment with paclitaxel (Taxol) or nocodazole. Taxol, a taxane drug commonly used in cancer treatment, stabilizes microtubules, whereas nocodazole causes depolymerization of the tubulin cytoskeleton (23Dumontet C.

IRS signaling was measured by assessing the phosphorylation status of AKT, a downstream signaling effector of PI3K, because the IRS proteins are required for the recruitment and activation of PI3K by the IGF-1R (4Myers Jr, M.G.

Although microtubule stabilization by Taxol treatment did not alter the level of AKT activation (Fig. 1A), disruption of the microtubule cytoskeleton in response to nocodazole treatment significantly reduced phosphorylation of AKT at both threonine 308 and serine 473 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the activation of ERK1/2 by IGF-1, which can occur independently of the IRS proteins (5Landis J. Shaw L.M. Insulin receptor substrate 2-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling selectively inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3β to regulate aerobic glycolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 18603-18613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was not decreased by nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1B). IGF-1-dependent AKT activation was also reduced when cells were treated with the Vinca alkaloid drug vinblastine, which also disrupts microtubules and is used clinically in chemotherapy regimens (Fig. 1C) (23Dumontet C. Jordan M.A. Microtubule-binding agents: a dynamic field of cancer therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 790-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that an intact microtubule cytoskeleton contributes to IRS-dependent activation of AKT by the IGF-1R. To investigate the mechanism by which nocodazole inhibits AKT activation, phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and IRS proteins and IRS/PI3K association were examined. Treatment with nocodazole did not decrease IRS-1 or IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation or association with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K in response to IGF-1 stimulation, indicating that activation of PI3K upstream of AKT was not inhibited by microtubule disruption (Fig. 1D). Of note, expression of the IGF-1R β subunit and its IGF-1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation were increased following nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1D). We attribute this increase to the accumulation of the activated receptor at the cell surface or in early endosomes, resulting in sustained expression and activation (27Rohatgi R.A. Janusis J. Leonard D. Bellvé K.D. Fogarty K.E. Baehrecke E.H. Corvera S. Shaw L.M. Beclin 1 regulates growth factor receptor signaling in breast cancer.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 5352-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine whether there is a selective role for the microtubule cytoskeleton in IRS-1- or IRS-2-mediated signaling, mammary tumor cells derived from PyMT:WT, PyMT:Irs-1−/−, or PyMT:Irs-2−/− tumors were treated with nocodazole and stimulated with IGF-1 (Fig. 2A). WT cells that express both Irs-1 and Irs-2 demonstrated a 40% reduction in Akt activation after treatment with nocodazole. PyMT:Irs-1−/− cells, which signal exclusively through Irs-2, exhibited a further reduction in IGF-1-dependent Akt activation (˜50%) following treatment with nocodazole. In contrast, Akt activation was equivalent in PyMT:Irs-2−/− cells, which signal exclusively through Irs-1, in response to IGF-1 stimulation following DMSO or nocodazole treatment. The role of IRS-2 in the sensitivity of cells to microtubule disruption was explored further using PyMT:Irs-1−/− and PyMT:Irs-2−/− cells that were derived from PyMT:Irs-1fl/fl and PyMT:Irs-2fl/fl cell lines, respectively, after acute adenoviral-Cre infection. PyMT:Irs-2fl/fl cells with or without restored IRS-2 expression were stimulated with IGF-1 after treatment with nocodazole and vinblastine. An additional Vinca alkaloid drug, vinorelbine, which is used to treat breast cancer patients (23Dumontet C. Jordan M.A. Microtubule-binding agents: a dynamic field of cancer therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 790-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar, 28Sangai T. Akcakanat A. Chen H. Tarco E. Wu Y. Do K.A. Miller T.W. Arteaga C.L. Mills G.B. Gonzalez-Angulo A.M.

Finek J. Oral vinorelbine in metastatic breast cancer: a review of current clinical trial results.Cancer Treat. Rev. 2012; 38: 120-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As observed previously (Fig. 2A), disruption of microtubules did not decrease Akt activation in cells lacking Irs-2 expression (Irs2−/−), whereas the increase in Akt activation that was observed upon restoration of IRS-2 expression was eliminated by microtubule disruption (Irs2−/−:IRS2) (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the -fold change reduction in Akt activation observed in Irs1−/− cells after nocodazole treatment (50%) was diminished (30%) upon restoration of IRS-1 expression (Irs−/−:IRS1) (Fig. 2C). Taxol treatment did not inhibit Akt activation in mouse mammary tumor cells (Fig. 2C), as was observed for MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1A). To assess the role of microtubules in IRS-2-mediated signaling in human breast carcinoma cells, IRS2 expression was suppressed by shRNA targeting in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2D). Total AKT activation in response to IGF-1 stimulation was reduced in shIRS-2 cells compared with shGFP cells (Fig. 2D, second and sixth lanes). Treatment of shGFP cells with either nocodazole or vinblastine significantly reduced AKT activation (Fig. 2D, third and fourth lanes), as was observed for the parental cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, no significant reduction in AKT phosphorylation occurred in the shIRS2 cells, which signal predominantly through IRS-1, upon treatment with either nocodazole or vinblastine (Fig. 2D, seventh and eighth lanes). The -fold difference in AKT activation observed in shGFP and shIRS2 cells upon microtubule disruption increased with time of stimulation, indicating that microtubules are required to sustain IRS2-dependent signaling (Fig. 2E). Taken together with the mouse cell line data, these results support the hypothesis that an intact microtubule cytoskeleton contributes to IGF-1 signaling through IRS-2 but not IRS-1. The dependence of IRS2 signaling to Akt on an intact microtubule cytoskeleton indicates a potential interaction of IRS-2 with microtubules. To investigate this possibility, the localization of IRS-1, IRS-2, and tubulin was examined by immunofluorescent staining and confocal imaging. For these experiments, SUM-159 breast carcinoma cells were used because they express both IRS-1 and IRS-2, spread well on coverslips, and retain their spread morphology upon treatment with Taxol and nocodazole, which facilitates detection of co-localization. Both IRS-1 and IRS-2 were expressed in a punctate manner throughout the cytoplasm, with a modest enhancement in the perinuclear region (Fig. 3; left panels). Although no specific pattern of staining was observed for IRS-1, the punctate staining for IRS-2 was more organized, with some apparent alignment along microtubules. To assess further the association of IRS-2 with microtubules, cells were stained after short-term incubation with either Taxol or nocodazole to evaluate their impact on IRS localization. The organized, linear pattern of IRS-2 staining was more apparent upon Taxol stabilization of the microtubules, and a subset of IRS-2 puncta co-localized with tubulin under these conditions (Fig. 3B, center panels). IRS-2 was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm with no tubulin co-localization upon disruption of microtubules by nocodazole (Fig. 3B, right panels). In contrast, IRS-1 staining was not modified in response to Taxol or nocodazole treatment (Fig. 3A). Drugs that target the microtubule cytoskeleton are used clinically for the treatment of cancer (23Dumontet C. Jordan M.A. Microtubule-binding agents: a dynamic field of cancer therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 790-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). To investigate how IRS-2 may impact the response of tumors to microtubule-stabilizing or -disrupting drugs, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 48 h with either nocodazole or Taxol and then analyzed for viability by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis. A significant increase in the sub-G1 population occurred in response to both nocodazole and Taxol treatment in shGFP control cells (Fig. 4A), consistent with an induction of cell death. Compared with shGFP cells, cell death was significantly diminished in shIRS-2 cells in response to nocodazole treatment (Fig. 4A). In contrast, when cells were treated with Taxol, which does not inhibit IRS2-mediated AKT signaling (Figs. 1A and 2C), cell death levels were similar for shGFP and shIRS2 cells. To further investigate the clinical relevance of the IRS2-dependent sensitivity of breast carcinoma cells to microtubule disruption, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with vinblastine or vinorelbine, both of which are used in the treatment of solid tumors, including breast cancer (23Dumontet C. Jordan M.A. Microtubule-binding agents: a dynamic field of cancer therapeutics.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 790-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). As was observed for nocodazole treatment, cell death was significantly diminished in shIRS2 cells treated with either vinblastine or vinorelbine compared with shGFP-treated cells (Fig. 4B). A similar resistance to cell death upon treatment with nocodazole was observed for PyMT:Irs2−/− cells compared with parental cells (PyMT:Irs2fl/fl) or Irs2−/− cells in which WT Irs-2 expression was restored (Irs2−/−:IRS2) (Fig. 5A). In contrast, restoration of IRS1 expression to PyMT:Irs1−/− cells reduced cell death in response to nocodazole treatment (Fig. 5B). Similar to MDA-MB-231 cells, cell death in response to Taxol treatment was not dependent upon Irs expression in PyMT mammary tumor cells (Fig. 5, A and B). As has been reported previously, cells undergo a G2/M arrest in response to microtubule disruption or stabilization (30Tishler R.B. Lamppu D.M. Park S. Price B.D. Microtubule-active drugs Taxol, vinblastine, and nocodazole increase the levels of transcriptionally active p53.Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6021-6025PubMed Google Scholar). The cell cycle profiles of cells treated with nocodazole or Taxol were analyzed to determine whether IRS2 expression influences the cell cycle response to microtubule-targeting drugs. MDA-MB-231:shGFP cells exhibited an increase in G2/M arrest when treated with nocodazole (Fig. 4C). In contrast, a significantly higher percentage of MDA-MB-231:shIRS2 cells remained in G1/G0 upon disruption of microtubules (Fig. 4D). This increase in G1/G0 cells was also observed in PyMT:Irs2−/− cells (Fig. 5D), and rescue of IRS-2 expression restored the G2/M arrest profile to that of the parental PyMT:Irs2fl/fl cells (Fig. 5, C and E). In contrast, PyMT:Irs1−/− cells exhibited G2/M arrest, and restoration of IRS-1 expression promoted an increase in G1/G0 cells (Fig. 5, F and G), similar to the profile of the IRS2-deficient cells that signal only through IRS1. All cells treated with Taxol exhibited a similar G2/M arrest profile (Figure 4, Figure 5). These data indicate that breast carcinoma cells that express and signal through IRS-2 are more sensitive to drugs that depolymerize microtubules and respond by undergoing cell cycle arrest and increased cell death, whereas the Taxol response is not determined by IRS-2 expression. Given that AKT signaling is selectively resistant to microtubule disruption in cells deficient for IRS2 expression, we hypothesized that the resistance of these cells to nocodazole-mediated cell death was the result of sustained AKT signaling in these cells. To test this hypothesis, cells were treated with nocodazole for 48 h in the presence or absence of an AKT-specific inhibitor, MK2206. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 shGFP and shIRS2 cells with MK2206 alone did not alter the percentage of sub-G1 cells (Fig. 6A) or cell cycle profile (Fig. 6, B and C), as has been reported previously for parental MDA-MB-231 cells at the concentration of inhibitor used in these assays (28Sangai T. Akcakanat A. Chen H. Tarco E. Wu Y. Do K.A. Miller T.W. Arteaga C.L. Mills G.B. Gonzalez-Angulo A.M. Meric-Bernstam F. Biomarkers of response to Akt inhibitor MK-2206 in breast cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2012; 18: 5816-5828Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This concentration of MK2206 was, however, sufficient to inhibit AKT activation (Fig. 6D). Combined treatment of the MDA-MB-231:shGFP cells with MK2206 and nocodazole did not increase cell death (Fig. 6A) or alter cell cycle progression (Fig. 6B). In contrast, addition of MK2206 to the nocodazole-treated MDA-MB-231:shIRS2 cells increased the percentage of sub-G1 cells to that observed for shGFP cells treated with nocodazole alone (Fig. 6A). Combined treatment with MK2206 and nocodazole also promoted G2/M arrest in these cells, restoring the cell cycle profile to that of the nocodazole-treated, IRS2-expressing cells (Fig. 6C). To investigate the mechanism of cell death in response to microtubule disruption, cell extracts from MDA-MB-231 cells treated with nocodazole for 48 h in the presence or absence of MK2206 were immunoblotted for cleaved caspase 3. Caspase 3 cleavage increased significantly upon treatment of shGFP cells with nocodazole, confirming that these cells undergo apoptotic cell death (Fig. 7A) (31Taylor R.C. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. Apoptosis: controlled demolition at the cellular level.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Cleaved caspase 3 levels were significantly lower in shIRS2 nocodazole-treated cells. However, combined treatment of shIRS2 cells with both nocodazole and MK2206 increased caspase 3 cleavage, supporting a role for AKT signaling in the enhanced viability of these cells. Analysis of upstream apoptotic effectors identified the BCL2 homology 3 (BH3)-only protein BIM as a potential regulator of caspase 3 activation in response to microtubule disruption (31Taylor R.C. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. Apoptosis: controlled demolition at the cellular level.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Specifically, the BIM-EL and BIM-L isoforms of BIM were expressed at elevated levels in shGFP cells compared"
https://openalex.org/W2598870852,"Background The positive relationship between lean mass (LM) and bone health is well known, but a positive association between insulin and LM has also been described. Insulin has some anabolic properties on bone through the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation, yet the role of LM as a confounder or mediator in this relationship remains uncertain. Objective To examine whether the association between insulin levels and bone health is mediated by LM. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Castilla La Mancha University (Spain) involving 466 young adults (113 young men; 19.5±2.3 years). LM and total-body bone mineral content (BMC) were measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, and insulin was measured in fasting serum samples. Results Young adults with high total LM had higher values of total-body BMC than their peers after controlling for age and sex, this relationship persisted after adjusting for insulin levels (p<0.001). In mediation analyses, insulin levels were positively associated with total-body BMC (b = 0.05; p<0.001) and total LM acted as an intermediate variable, attenuating the association between insulin levels and total-body BMC (b = -31.98; p>0.05) as indicated by Sobel test values for indirect effect (z = 4.43; p<0.001). Conclusions LM plays an important role in the relationship between insulin levels and bone health, in such a way that while increases in LM have a positive influence on bone health, they are also negatively associated with insulin levels."
https://openalex.org/W2602176577,"Objective Very short acquisition times and the use of low-kV protocols in CTA demand modifications in the contrast media (CM) injection regimen. The aim of this study was to optimize the use of CM delivery parameters in thoraco-abdominal CTA in a porcine model. Materials and methods Six pigs (55–68 kg) were examined with a dynamic CTA protocol (454 mm scan length, 2.5 s temporal resolution, 70 s total acquisition time). Four CM injection protocols were applied in a randomized order. 120 kV CTA protocol: (A) 300 mg iodine/kg bodyweight (bw), IDR = 1.5 g/s (flow = 5 mL/s), injection time (ti) 12 s (60 kg bw). 70 kV CTA protocols: 150 mg iodine/kg bw: (B) IDR = 0.75 g/s (flow = 2.5 mL/s), ti = 12 s (60 kg bw); (C) IDR = 1.5 g/s (flow = 5 mL/s), ti = 12 s (60 kg bw); (D) IDR = 3.0 g/s (flow = 10 mL/s), ti = 3 s (60 kg bw). The complete CM bolus shape was monitored by creating time attenuation curves (TAC) in different vascular territories. Based on the TAC, the time to peak (TTP) and the peak enhancement were determined. The diagnostic window (relative enhancement > 300 HU), was calculated and compared to visual inspection of the corresponding CTA data sets. Results The average relative arterial peak enhancements after baseline correction were 358.6 HU (A), 356.6 HU (B), 464.0 HU (C), and 477.6 HU (D). The TTP decreased with increasing IDR and decreasing ti, protocols A and B did not differ significantly (systemic arteries, p = 0.843; pulmonary arteries, p = 0.183). The delay time for bolus tracking (trigger level 100 HU; target enhancement 300 HU) for single-phase CTA was comparable for protocol A and B (3.9, 4.3 s) and C and D (2.4, 2.0 s). The scan window time frame was comparable for the different protocols by visual inspection of the different CTA data sets and by analyzing the TAC. Conclusions All protocols provided sufficient arterial enhancement. The use of a 70 kV CTA protocol is recommended because of a 50% reduction of total CM volume and a 50% reduced flow rate while maintaining the bolus profile. In contrast to pulmonary arterial enhancement, the systemic arterial enhancement improved only slightly increasing the IDR from 1.5 g/s to 3 g/s because of bolus dispersion of the very short bolus (3s) in the lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2598668093,"Observing moving body parts can automatically activate topographically corresponding motor representations in the primary motor cortex (M1), the so-called direct matching. Novel neurophysiological findings from social contexts are nonetheless proving that this process is not automatic as previously thought. The motor system can flexibly shift from imitative to incongruent motor preparation, when requested by a social gesture. In the present study we aim to bring an increase in the literature by assessing whether and how diverting overt spatial attention might affect motor preparation in contexts requiring interactive responses from the onlooker. Experiment 1 shows that overt attention—although anchored to an observed biological movement—can be captured by a target object as soon as a social request for it becomes evident. Experiment 2 reveals that the appearance of a short-lasting red dot in the contralateral space can divert attention from the target, but not from the biological movement. Nevertheless, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over M1 combined with electromyography (EMG) recordings (Experiment 3) indicates that attentional interference reduces corticospinal excitability related to the observed movement, but not motor preparation for a complementary action on the target. This work provides evidence that social motor preparation is impermeable to attentional interference and that a double dissociation is present between overt orienting of spatial attention and neurophysiological markers of action observation."
https://openalex.org/W2603459612,"The structure and state of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) oligomers often need to be checked by reliable experimental methods. Electrophoresis is a commonly applied measurement method. However, due to the presence of detergents, oligomers are easily broken during electrophoresis, which makes it very hard to accurately assess Aβ aggregate states. In the current study, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) was used to cross-link Aβ1–42 oligomers prior to electrophoresis. When compared to a previously reported Aβ cross-linking agent, glutaraldehyde, it was quite apparent that BS3 is more suitable for detecting intra-membrane Aβ oligomers and extra-membrane Aβ oligomers states. As such, our findings provide an efficient method for analyzing Aβ proteins or other proteins that are easily aggregated in solution and in phospholipid membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2603648904,"Shati/Nat8L significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice after repeated methamphetamine (METH) treatment. We reported that Shati/Nat8L overexpression in mouse NAc attenuated METH-induced hyperlocomotion, locomotor sensitization, and conditioned place preference. We recently found that Shati/Nat8L overexpression in NAc regulates the dopaminergic neuronal system via the activation of group II mGluRs by elevated N-acetylaspartylglutamate following N-acetylaspartate increase due to the overexpression. These findings suggest that Shati/Nat8L suppresses METH-induced responses. However, the mechanism by which METH increases the Shati/Nat8L mRNA expression in NAc is unclear. To investigate the regulatory mechanism of Shati/Nat8L mRNA expression, we performed a mouse Shati/Nat8L luciferase assay using PC12 cells. Next, we investigated the response of METH to Shati/Nat8L expression and CREB activity using mouse brain slices of NAc, METH administration to mice, and western blotting for CREB activity of specific dopamine receptor signals in vivo and ex vivo. We found that METH activates CREB binding to the Shati/Nat8L promoter to induce the Shati/Nat8L mRNA expression. Furthermore, the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390, but not the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride, inhibited the upregulation of Shati/Nat8L and CREB activities in the mouse NAc slices. Thus, the administration of the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 increased the Shati/Nat8L mRNA expression in mouse NAc. These results showed that the Shati/Nat8L mRNA was increased by METH-induced CREB pathway via dopamine D1 receptor signaling in mouse NAc. These findings may contribute to development of a clinical tool for METH addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2598297252,"Background The relation of a single risk factor with atherosclerosis is established. Clinically we know of risk factor clustering within individuals. Yet, studies into the magnitude of the relation of risk factor clusters with atherosclerosis are limited. Here, we assessed that relation. Methods Individual participant data from 14 cohorts, involving 59,025 individuals were used in this cross-sectional analysis. We made 15 clusters of four risk factors (current smoking, overweight, elevated blood pressure, elevated total cholesterol). Multilevel age and sex adjusted linear regression models were applied to estimate mean differences in common carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) between clusters using those without any of the four risk factors as reference group. Results Compared to the reference, those with 1, 2, 3 or 4 risk factors had a significantly higher common CIMT: mean difference of 0.026 mm, 0.052 mm, 0.074 mm and 0.114 mm, respectively. These findings were the same in men and in women, and across ethnic groups. Within each risk factor cluster (1, 2, 3 risk factors), groups with elevated blood pressure had the largest CIMT and those with elevated cholesterol the lowest CIMT, a pattern similar for men and women. Conclusion Clusters of risk factors relate to increased common CIMT in a graded manner, similar in men, women and across race-ethnic groups. Some clusters seemed more atherogenic than others. Our findings support the notion that cardiovascular prevention should focus on sets of risk factors rather than individual levels alone, but may prioritize within clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2950025653,"Equity, defined as reward according to contribution, is considered a central aspect of human fairness in both philosophical debates and scientific research. Despite large amounts of research on the evolutionary origins of fairness, the evolutionary rationale behind equity is still unknown. Here, we investigate how equity can be understood in the context of the cooperative environment in which humans evolved. We model a population of individuals who cooperate to produce and divide a resource, and choose their cooperative partners based on how they are willing to divide the resource. Agent-based simulations, an analytical model, and extended simulations using neural networks provide converging evidence that equity is the best evolutionary strategy in such an environment: individuals maximize their fitness by dividing benefits in proportion to their own and their partners’ relative contribution. The need to be chosen as a cooperative partner thus creates a selection pressure strong enough to explain the evolution of preferences for equity. We discuss the limitations of our model, the discrepancies between its predictions and empirical data, and how interindividual and intercultural variability fit within this framework."
https://openalex.org/W2602829699,"Individuals with autism-spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit impairments in response to others' pain. Evidence suggests that features of autism are not restricted to individuals with ASD, and that autistic traits vary throughout the general population. To investigate the association between autistic traits and the responses to others' pain in typically developing adults, we employed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) to quantify autistic traits in a group of 1670 healthy adults and explored whether 60 participants (30 males and 30 females) with 10% highest AQ scores (High-AQ) would exhibit difficulties in the responses to others' pain relative to 60 participants (30 males and 30 females) with 10% lowest AQ scores (Low-AQ). This study included a Visual Task and an Auditory Task to test behavioral differences between High-AQ and Low-AQ groups' responses to others' pain in both modalities. For the Visual Task, participants were instructed to respond to pictures depicting others' pain. They were instructed to judge the stimuli type (painful or not), judge others' pain intensity, and indicate the unpleasantness they personally felt. For the Auditory Task, experimental procedures were identical to the Visual Task except that painful voices were added. Results showed the High-AQ group was less accurate than the Low-AQ group in judging others' pain. Moreover, relative to Low-AQ males, High-AQ males had significantly longer reaction times in judging others' pain in the Auditory Task. However, High-AQ and Low-AQ females showed similar reaction times in both tasks. These findings demonstrated identification of others' pain by healthy adults is related to the extent of autistic traits, gender, and modality."
https://openalex.org/W2598983257,"Chronic sleep restriction (SR) increases sleepiness, negatively impacts mood, and impairs a variety of cognitive performance measures. The vast majority of work establishing these effects are tightly controlled in-lab experimental studies. Examining commonly-experienced levels of SR in naturalistic settings is more difficult and generally involves observational methods, rather than active manipulations of sleep. The same is true for analyzing behavioral and cognitive outcomes at circadian unfavorable times. The current study tested the ability of an at-home protocol to manipulate sleep schedules (i.e., impose SR), as well as create a mismatch between a subject’s circadian preference and time of testing. Viability of the protocol was assessed via completion, compliance with the SR, and success at manipulating sleepiness and mood. An online survey was completed by 3630 individuals to assess initial eligibility, 256 agreed via email response to participate in the 3-week study, 221 showed for the initial in-person session, and 184 completed the protocol (175 with complete data). The protocol consisted of 1 week at-home SR (5-6 hours in bed/night), 1 week wash-out, and 1 week well-rested (WR: 8-9 hours in bed/night). Sleep was monitored with actigraphy, diary, and call-ins. Risk management strategies were implemented for subject safety. At the end of each experimental week, subjects reported sleepiness and mood ratings. Protocol completion was 83%, with lower depression scores, higher anxiety scores, and morning session assignment predicting completion. Compliance with the sleep schedule was also very good. Subjects spent approximately 2 hours less time in bed/night and obtained an average of 1.5 hours less nightly sleep during SR, relative to WR, with 82% of subjects obtaining at least 60 minutes less average nightly sleep. Sleepiness and mood were impacted as expected by SR. These findings show the viability of studying experimental chronic sleep restriction outside the laboratory, assuming appropriate safety precautions are taken, thus allowing investigators to significantly increase ecological validity over strictly controlled in-lab studies."
https://openalex.org/W2597685273,"The potential immunomodulatory role of microRNAs in small intestine of patients with acute watery diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae O1 or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection was investigated. Duodenal biopsies were obtained from study-participants at the acute (day 2) and convalescent (day 21) stages of disease, and from healthy individuals. Levels of miR-146a, miR-155 and miR-375 and target gene (IRAK1, TRAF6, CARD10) and 11 cytokine mRNAs were determined by qRT-PCR. The cellular source of microRNAs in biopsies was analyzed by in situ hybridization. The ability of V. cholerae bacteria and their secreted products to cause changes in microRNA- and mRNA levels in polarized tight monolayers of intestinal epithelial cells was investigated. miR-146a and miR-155 were expressed at significantly elevated levels at acute stage of V. cholerae infection and declined to normal at convalescent stage (P<0.009 versus controls; P = 0.03 versus convalescent stage, pairwise). Both microRNAs were mainly expressed in the epithelium. Only marginal down-regulation of target genes IRAK1 and CARD10 was seen and a weak cytokine-profile was identified in the acute infected mucosa. No elevation of microRNA levels was seen in ETEC infection. Challenge of tight monolayers with the wild type V. cholerae O1 strain C6706 and clinical isolates from two study-participants, caused significant increase in miR-155 and miR-146a by the strain C6706 (P<0.01). One clinical isolate caused reduction in IRAK1 levels (P<0.05) and none of the strains induced inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, secreted factors from these strains caused markedly increased levels of IL-8, IL-1β, and CARD10 (P<0.001), without inducing microRNA expression. Thus, miR-146a and miR-155 are expressed in the duodenal epithelium at the acute stage of cholera. The inducer is probably the V. cholerae bacterium. By inducing microRNAs the bacterium can limit the innate immune response of the host, including inflammation evoked by its own secreted factors, thereby decreasing the risk of being eliminated."

Insights into these problems are essential for developing adequate policies which address the needs of the increasing population of dual sensory impaired older adults in long-term care.A qualitative study was conducted in parallel with a cluster randomized controlled trial. Dual sensory impaired older adults in the intervention group (n = 47, age range 82-98) were invited by a familiar nurse to identify the problems they wanted to address. Data were taken from the semi-structured intervention diaries in which nurses noted the older adults' verbal responses during a five-month intervention period in 17 long-term care homes across the Netherlands. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis based on the Grounded Theory.The 47 dual sensory impaired older adults identified a total of 122 problems. Qualitative content analysis showed that the older adults encountered participation problems and problems controlling what happens in their personal environment. Three categories of participation problems emerged: (1) existential concerns of not belonging or not being able to connect with other people, (2) lack of access to communication, information and mobility, and (3) the desire to be actively involved in care delivery. Two categories of control-in-personal-space problems emerged: (1) lack of control of their own physical belongings, and (2) lack of control regarding the behavior of nurses providing daily care in their personal environment.The invasive problems identified indicate that dual sensory impaired older adults experience great existential pressures on their lives. Long-term care providers need to develop and implement policies that identify and address these problems, and be aware of adverse consequences of usual care, in order to improve dual sensory impaired residents' autonomy and quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2598095298,"Despite the strong association between Cryptococcus neoformans infection and the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status of patients globally, most cryptococcosis cases in Far East Asia occur in non-HIV individuals. Molecular epidemiological studies, using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), have shown that more than 95% of cryptococcal strains belong to a specific subtype of VNI. However, this association has never been specifically examined in other parts of Asia. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the VNIc/ST5 genotype distribution among cryptococcosis patients in Thailand. Fifty-one C. neoformans isolates were collected from clinical samples in Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. The strains were predominantly isolated from HIV-positive patients (88.57%) and all were molecular type VNI MATα. An MLST analysis identified five sequence types (ST) in Siriraj Hospital, of which ST4 (45.10%) and ST6 (35.29%) were most common, and ST5 (15.69%), ST32 (1.96%), and ST93 (1.96) were less common. Contrary to reports from Far East Asia, ST5 was predominantly (83.33%) found in HIV patients (P = 0.657), and there was no significant change in the prevalence of ST5 over the past 10 years (P = 0.548). A further analysis of comorbidities showed higher morbidity and delays in the cryptococcal diagnosis in patients with tuberculosis coinfection or without HIV. Our study suggests that although the Thai population is genetically closely related to the Far East Asian population, ST5 is not associated with non-HIV status in Thailand. Therefore, this association may not be related to the host's genetic background. However, its mechanism remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2602849199,"Objectives To explore the relationship between the MAPKs/TGF-β1/TRAF6 signaling pathway and atrial fibrosis in patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and its role in atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery on the basis of our previous animal study of the MAPKs/TGF-β1/TRAF6 signaling pathway in atrial fibrosis. Methods A total of 57 patients with RHD without a history of AF consented to left atrial biopsy. Histopathology quantified the percentage of fibrosis, and real-time PCR and western blot assessed the mRNA and protein expression of TGF-β1, TRAF6, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), respectively. Western blot was also used to measure the protein expression of phosphorylated MAPKs and TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). Serum angiotensin II (Ang II) levels were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results Eighteen patients developed AF, whereas 39 remained in sinus rhythm (SR). The severity of atrial fibrosis was significantly higher in patients who developed AF versus those who remained in SR; the mRNA and protein expression of TGF-β1, TRAF6 and CTGF were significantly higher in patients with AF. The protein expression of phosphorylated MAPKs and TAK1 was significantly increased in patients who developed AF compared with the patients who remained in SR. Serum Ang II levels were significantly higher in patients who developed AF versus those who remained in SR. Conclusion The MAPKs/TGF-β1/TRAF6 signaling pathway is involved in atrial fibrosis in patients with RHD, which results in the occurrence of AF after cardiac surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2598255572,"We investigated effects of 7-oxygenated cholesterol derivatives present in atherosclerotic lesions, 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7αOHChol), 7β-hydroxycholesterol (7βOHChol), and 7-ketocholesterol (7K), on IL-8 expression. Transcript levels of IL-8 and secretion of its corresponding gene product by monocytes/macrophages were enhanced by treatment with 7αOHChol and, to a lesser extent, 7K, but not by 7βOHChol. The 7-oxygenated cholesterol derivatives, however, did not change transcription of the IL-8 gene in vascular smooth muscle cells. 7αOHChol-induced IL-8 gene transcription was inhibited by cycloheximide and Akt1 downregulation, but not by OxPAPC. Expression of C5a receptor was upregulated after stimulation with 7αOHChol, but not with 7K and 7βOHChol, and a specific antagonist of C5a receptor inhibited 7αOHChol-induced IL-8 gene expression in a dose dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and MEK almost completely inhibited expression of both IL-8 and cell-surface C5a receptor induced by 7αOHChol. These results indicate that 7-oxygenated cholesterol derivatives have differential effects on monocyte/macrophage expression of IL-8 and C5a receptor and that C5a receptor is involved in 7αOHChol-induced IL-8 expression via PI3K and MEK."
https://openalex.org/W2602005387,"Sortase A (SrtA) has long been recognized as an ideal drug target for therapeutic agents against Gram-positive pathogens. However, the SrtA of Streptococcus suis (Ss-SrtA), an important zoonotic agent, has not been studied. In this study, the enzymatic properties of Ss-SrtA were investigated, and inhibition of Ss-SrtA by natural products was evaluated. Ss-SrtA was expressed and purified. The purified recombinant Ss-SrtA had maximal activity at pH 6.0–7.5, 45°C, and showed a Km of 6.7 μM for the hydrolysis of substrate abz-LPATG-dnp. Different from Staphylococcus aureus SrtA (Sa-SrtA) which is stimulated by Ca2+, Ss-SrtA was observed to be Ca2+ independent. Structural analysis showed that salt bridges formed between K111 and D180 in Ss-SrtA replaced the function of Ca2+ in Sa-SrtA to stabilize the substrate-binding cleft. Site-directed mutagenesis identified H126, C192 and R200 as the key residues of Ss-SrtA active site. To discover potential inhibitors, the percent inhibition of sortase activity by natural products was measured. Among these selected natural products, acteoside, isoquercitrin and baicalin were discovered as novel SrtA inhibitors, with IC50 values of 36.3 ± 1.3 μM, 100.0 ± 1.3 μM and 85.4 ± 1.5 μM, respectively. The inhibitory effects of these three natural products were further confirmed on endogenous Sa-SrtA. Using a previously established S. aureus model with a fluorescent-labeled Sa-SrtA substrate, acteoside, isoquercitrin, and baicalin showed 86%, 28% and 45% inhibition on endogenous Sa-SrtA activity, respectively. Overall, these findings shed new light on enzymatic properties, Ca2+-independent catalytic mechanism and potential inhibitors of Ss-SrtA."
https://openalex.org/W2603192771,"The effects of climate change on animal populations may be shaped by habitat characteristics at both micro- and macro-habitat level, however, empirical studies integrating these two scales of observation are lacking. As analyses of the effects of climate change commonly rely on data from a much larger scale than the microhabitat level organisms are affected at, this mismatch risks hampering progress in developing understanding of the details of the ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms and, ultimately, effective actions to preserve their populations. Cavity nesters, often with a conservation status of concern, are an ideal model because the cavity is a microenvironment potentially different from the macroenvironment but nonetheless inevitably interacting with it. The lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) is a cavity nester which was until recently classified by as Vulnerable species. Since 2004, for nine years, we collected detailed biotic and abiotic data at both micro- and macro-scales of observation in a kestrel population breeding in the Gela Plain (Italy), a Mediterranean area where high temperatures may reach lethal values for the nest content. We show that macroclimatic features needed to be integrated with both abiotic and biotic factors recorded at a microscale before reliably predicting nest temperatures. Among the nest types used by lesser kestrels, we detected a preferential occupation of the cooler nest types, roof tiles, by early breeders whereas, paradoxically, late breeders nesting with hotter temperatures occupied the overheated nest holes. Not consistent with such a suggested nest selection, the coolest nest type did not host a higher reproductive success than the overheated nests. We discussed our findings in the light of cavity temperatures and nest types deployed within conservation actions assessed by integrating selected factors at different observation scales."

https://openalex.org/W2602474821,"Microtubules are polar cytoskeleton filaments that extend via growth at their plus ends. Microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPs) accumulate at these growing plus ends to control microtubule dynamics and attachment. The +TIP end-binding protein 1 (EB1) and its homologs possess an autonomous plus-end-tracking mechanism and interact with other known +TIPs, which then recruit those +TIPs to the growing plus ends. A major +TIP class contains the SXIP (Ser-X-Ile-Pro, with X denoting any amino acid residue) motif, known to interact with EB1 and its homologs for plus-end tracking, but the role of SXIP in regulating EB1 activities is unclear. We show here that an interaction of EB1 with the SXIP-containing +TIP CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 2 (CDK5RAP2) regulates several EB1 activities, including microtubule plus-end tracking, dynamics at microtubule plus ends, microtubule and α/β-tubulin binding, and microtubule polymerization. The SXIP motif fused with a dimerization domain from CDK5RAP2 significantly enhanced EB1 plus-end-tracking and microtubule-polymerizing and bundling activities, but the SXIP motif alone failed to do so. An SXIP-binding-deficient EB1 mutant displayed significantly lower microtubule plus-end tracking than the wild-type protein in transfected cells. These results suggest that EB1 cooperates with CDK5RAP2 and perhaps other SXIP-containing +TIPs in tracking growing microtubule tips. We also generated plus-end-tracking chimeras of CDK5RAP2 and the adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) and found that overexpression of the dimerization domains interfered with microtubule plus-end tracking of their respective SXIP-containing chimeras. Our results suggest that disruption of SXIP dimerization enables detailed investigations of microtubule plus-end-associated functions of individual SXIP-containing +TIPs."
https://openalex.org/W2600024648,"Peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) is an indicator of cardiovascular health and a useful tool for risk stratification. Direct measurement of VO2peak is resource-demanding and may be contraindicated. There exist several non-exercise models to estimate VO2peak that utilize easily obtainable health parameters, but none of them includes lung function measures or hemoglobin concentrations. We aimed to test whether addition of these parameters could improve prediction of VO2peak compared to an established model that includes age, waist circumference, self-reported physical activity and resting heart rate. We included 1431 subjects aged 69-77 years that completed a laboratory test of VO2peak, spirometry, and a gas diffusion test. Prediction models for VO2peak were developed with multiple linear regression, and goodness of fit was evaluated. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide and blood hemoglobin concentration significantly improved the ability of the established model to predict VO2peak. The explained variance of the model increased from 31% to 48% for men and from 32% to 38% for women (p<0.001). FEV1, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide and hemoglobin concentration substantially improved the accuracy of VO2peak prediction when added to an established model in an elderly population."
https://openalex.org/W2600361947,"Studies have suggested a potential role of patient's co-morbidity in determining the survival outcomes of breast cancer. In this study, we examined the long-term oncologic outcomes in breast cancer patients who underwent curative surgery according to their pre-existing comorbid conditions and analyzed the association between the co-morbidity and the use of adjuvant therapies.The medical records of 2,501 patients who underwent surgery for primary breast cancer from June 2006 to June 2010 were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were classified into three groups according to preoperative ASA status determined by the anesthesiologists. Clinico-pathologic characteristics and survival outcomes of the patients were compared among the different co-morbidity groups.There were 1,792 (71.6%), 665 (26.6%), and 44 (1.8%) patients in ASA I, II, and III, respectively. Total 95 (3.8%) deaths and 269 (10.8%) recurrences (loco-regional and distant) occurred during the median follow-up period of 71 months. Patients with high comorbidity showed significantly higher rate of deaths (51 (2.8%), 38 (5.7%) and 6 (13.6%) deaths in ASA I, II and III group, respectively, p<0.001). The ASA 3 patients also showed significantly higher rate of breast cancer recurrence when compared to other groups (180 (10.0%), 80 (12.0%) and 9 (20.5%) in ASA I, II, and III, respectively, p = 0.041). Significantly fewer patients in the high co-morbidity group received adjuvant therapies (77 (4.3%), 44 (6.6%) and 8 (18.2%) in ASA I, II, and III, respectively, p<0.001). The increased recurrence of breast cancer in the high morbidity group was mostly seen in patients who did not receive adjuvant therapies. The incidence of serious adverse effect during the adjuvant therapy did not differ according to the co-morbidity conditions.In this study, high comorbidity was related to increased risk of death and recurrence in breast cancer. The increased risk of recurrence in high co-morbidity group was mostly seen in patients who did not receive adjuvant therapies. Considering the relatively low rates of serious adverse effects in high co-morbidity patients who received adjuvant therapies, active use of adjuvant therapies in selected patients may improve survival outcomes in breast cancer patients with severe co-morbidities."
https://openalex.org/W2603735558,"Objective The brain’s functional architecture of interconnected network-related oscillatory patterns in discrete cortical regions has been well established with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies or direct cortical electrophysiology from electrodes placed on the surface of the brain, or electrocorticography (ECoG). These resting state networks exhibit a robust functional architecture that persists through all stages of sleep and under anesthesia. While the stability of these networks provides a fundamental understanding of the organization of the brain, understanding how these regions can be perturbed is also critical in defining the brain’s ability to adapt while learning and recovering from injury. Methods Patients undergoing an awake craniotomy for resection of a tumor were studied as a unique model of an evolving injury to help define how the cortical physiology and the associated networks were altered by the presence of an invasive brain tumor. Results This study demonstrates that there is a distinct pattern of alteration of cortical physiology in the setting of a malignant glioma. These changes lead to a physiologic sequestration and progressive synaptic homogeneity suggesting that a de-learning phenomenon occurs within the tumoral tissue compared to its surroundings. Significance These findings provide insight into how the brain accommodates a region of “defunctionalized” cortex. Additionally, these findings may have important implications for emerging techniques in brain mapping using endogenous cortical physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2949330293,"Polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in regulatory proteins are extremely polymorphic. As functional elements under selection for length, triplet repeats are prone to DNA replication slippage and indel mutations. Many polyQ tracts are also embedded within intrinsically disordered domains, which are less constrained, fast evolving, and difficult to characterize. To identify structural principles underlying polyQ tracts in disordered regulatory domains, here I analyze deep evolution of metazoan Notch polyQ tracts, which can generate alleles causing developmental and neurogenic defects. I show that Notch features polyQ tract turnover that is restricted to a discrete number of conserved ""polyQ insertion slots"". Notch polyQ insertion slots are: (i) identifiable by an amphipathic ""slot leader"" motif; (ii) conserved as an intact C-terminal array in a 1-to-1 relationship with the N-terminal solenoid-forming ankyrin repeats (ARs); and (iii) enriched in carboxamide residues (Q/N), whose sidechains feature dual hydrogen bond donor and acceptor atoms. Correspondingly, the terminal loop and β-strand of each AR feature conserved carboxamide residues, which would be susceptible to folding interference by hydrogen bonding with residues outside the ARs. I thus suggest that Notch polyQ insertion slots constitute an array of AR interference elements (ARIEs). Notch ARIEs would dynamically compete with the delicate serial folding induced by adjacent ARs. Huntingtin, which harbors solenoid-forming HEAT repeats, also possesses a similar number of polyQ insertion slots. These results suggest that intrinsically disordered interference arrays featuring carboxamide and polyQ enrichment may constitute coupled proteodynamic modulators of solenoids."
https://openalex.org/W2602274054,"Although several proteins have been implicated in secretory vesicle tethering, the identity and mechanical properties of the components forming the physical vesicle-plasma membrane link remain unknown. Here we present the first experimental measurements of nanomechanical properties of secretory vesicle-plasma membrane tethers using combined AFM force clamp and TIRF microscopy on membrane sheets from PC12 cells expressing the vesicle marker ANF-eGFP. Application of pulling forces generated tether extensions composed of multiple steps with variable length. The frequency of short (<10 nm) tether extension events was markedly higher when a fluorescent vesicle was present at the cantilever tip and increased in the presence of GTPγS, indicating that these events reflect specifically the properties of vesicle-plasma membrane tethers. The magnitude of the short tether extension events is consistent with extension lengths expected from progressive unfolding of individual helices of the exocyst complex, supporting its direct role in forming the physical vesicle-plasma membrane link."
https://openalex.org/W2600380574,"Sparse coding performs well in image classification. However, robust target recognition requires a lot of comprehensive template images and the sparse learning process is complex. We incorporate sparsity into a template matching concept to construct a local sparse structure matching (LSSM) model for general infrared target recognition. A local structure preserving sparse coding (LSPSc) formulation is proposed to simultaneously preserve the local sparse and structural information of objects. By adding a spatial local structure constraint into the classical sparse coding algorithm, LSPSc can improve the stability of sparse representation for targets and inhibit background interference in infrared images. Furthermore, a kernel LSPSc (K-LSPSc) formulation is proposed, which extends LSPSc to the kernel space to weaken the influence of the linear structure constraint in nonlinear natural data. Because of the anti-interference and fault-tolerant capabilities, both LSPSc- and K-LSPSc-based LSSM can implement target identification based on a simple template set, which just needs several images containing enough local sparse structures to learn a sufficient sparse structure dictionary of a target class. Specifically, this LSSM approach has stable performance in the target detection with scene, shape and occlusions variations. High performance is demonstrated on several datasets, indicating robust infrared target recognition in diverse environments and imaging conditions."
