https://openalex.org/W2155024327,"Background Population aging is closely related to high prevalence of chronic conditions in developed countries. In this context, health care policies aim to increase life span cost-effectively while maintaining quality of life and functional ability. There is still, however, a need for further understanding of how chronic conditions affect these health aspects. The aim of this paper is to assess the individual and combined impact of chronic physical and mental conditions on quality of life and disability in Spain, and secondly to show gender trends. Methods Cross-sectional data were collected from the COURAGE study. A total of 3,625 participants over 50 years old from Spain were included. Crude and adjusted multiple linear regressions were conducted to detect associations between individual chronic conditions and disability, and between chronic conditions and quality of life. Separate models were used to assess the influence of the number of diseases on the same variables. Additional analogous regressions were performed for males and females. Results All chronic conditions except hypertension were statistically associated with poor results in quality of life and disability. Depression, anxiety and stroke were found to have the greatest impact on outcomes. The number of chronic conditions was associated with substantially lower quality of life [β for 4+ diseases: −18.10 (−20.95,−15.25)] and greater disability [β for 4+ diseases: 27.64 (24.99,30.29]. In general, women suffered from higher rates of multimorbidity and poorer results in quality of life and disability. Conclusions Chronic conditions impact greatly on quality of life and disability in the older Spanish population, especially when co-occurring diseases are added. Multimorbidity considerations should be a priority in the development of future health policies focused on quality of life and disability. Further studies would benefit from an expanded selection of diseases. Policies should also deal with gender idiosyncrasy in certain cases."
https://openalex.org/W2099238523,"Understanding the ecological and anthropogenic drivers of population dynamics requires detailed studies on habitat selection and spatial distribution. Although small pelagic fish aggregate in large shoals and usually exhibit important spatial structure, their dynamics in time and space remain unpredictable and challenging. In the Gulf of Lions (north-western Mediterranean), sardine and anchovy biomasses have declined over the past 5 years causing an important fishery crisis while sprat abundance rose. Applying geostatistical tools on scientific acoustic surveys conducted in the Gulf of Lions, we investigated anchovy, sardine and sprat spatial distributions and structures over 10 years. Our results show that sardines and sprats were more coastal than anchovies. The spatial structure of the three species was fairly stable over time according to variogram outputs, while year-to-year variations in kriged maps highlighted substantial changes in their location. Support for the McCall's basin hypothesis (covariation of both population density and presence area with biomass) was found only in sprats, the most variable of the three species. An innovative method to investigate species collocation at different scales revealed that globally the three species strongly overlap. Although species often co-occurred in terms of presence/absence, their biomass density differed at local scale, suggesting potential interspecific avoidance or different sensitivity to local environmental characteristics. Persistent favourable areas were finally detected, but their environmental characteristics remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2062594530,"Background In spite of the salt iodization, iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) have not been sustainably eliminated in China. There are coastal areas with low iodized salt coverage rates (iodine nutrition is inadequate) and other areas with excessive amounts of iodine in the drinking water. Objective This study aimed to clarify the association of iodine deficiencies resulting from a low coverage rate of iodized salt, excess iodine intake from drinking water with thyroid function and disease in adults. Design A cross-sectional study was conducted in adults in different iodine nutrition areas in three provinces in China. Results The prevalence of thyroid nodules was 15.52%, 8.66% and 22.17% in the iodine excess, sufficient and deficient groups, respectively. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism was 20.09%, 10.41%, and 2.25% in the excess, sufficient and deficient iodine groups, respectively. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism and overt hyperthyroidism in the iodine deficient group was higher than that in the iodine excess group ( = 9.302, p = 0.002) and iodine sufficient group ( = 7.553, p = 0.006). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was significantly correlated with excess iodine intake (β = 1.764,P = 0.001) and deficient iodine intake (β = −1.219, P = 0.028). Conclusions Thyroid nodules are more likely to be present in the iodine excess and deficient areas than in the iodine sufficient areas. Subclinical hyperthyroidism and overt hyperthyroidism are more likely to be prevalent in the iodine deficient areas than in the iodine excess or sufficient areas. Subclinical hypothyroidism is more likely to be prevalent in the high iodine intake areas than in the iodine deficient or sufficient areas. Median TSH may be deemed as an alternative indicator for monitoring the iodine nutrition status of the adult population in iodine excess and deficient areas."
https://openalex.org/W2006784816,"Nitroxyl (HNO), the protonated one-electron reduction product of NO, remains an enigmatic reactive nitrogen species. Its chemical reactivity and biological activity are still not completely understood. HNO donors show biological effects different from NO donors. Although HNO reactivity with molecular oxygen is described in the literature, the product of this reaction has not yet been unambiguously identified. Here we report that the decomposition of HNO donors under aerobic conditions in aqueous solutions at physiological pH leads to the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) as a major intermediate. We have specifically detected and quantified ONOO− with the aid of boronate probes, e.g. coumarin-7-boronic acid or 4-boronobenzyl derivative of fluorescein methyl ester. In addition to the major phenolic products, peroxynitrite-specific minor products of oxidation of boronate probes were detected under these conditions. Using the competition kinetics method and a set of HNO scavengers, the value of the second order rate constant of the HNO reaction with oxygen (k = 1.8 × 104 m−1 s−1) was determined. The rate constant (k = 2 × 104 m−1 s−1) was also determined using kinetic simulations. The kinetic parameters of the reactions of HNO with selected thiols, including cysteine, dithiothreitol, N-acetylcysteine, captopril, bovine and human serum albumins, and hydrogen sulfide, are reported. Biological and cardiovascular implications of nitroxyl reactions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2022656343,"The Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly) is one of the world's most economically damaging pests. It displays highly seasonal population dynamics, and the environmental conditions suitable for its abundance are not constant throughout the year in most places. An extensive literature search was performed to obtain the most comprehensive data on the historical and contemporary spatio-temporal occurrence of the pest globally. The database constructed contained 2328 unique geo-located entries on Medfly detection sites from 43 countries and nearly 500 unique localities, as well as information on hosts, life stages and capture method. Of these, 125 localities had information on the month when Medfly was recorded and these data were complemented by additional material found in comprehensive databases available online. Records from 1980 until present were used for medfly environmental niche modeling. Maximum Entropy Algorithm (MaxEnt) and a set of seasonally varying environmental covariates were used to predict the fundamental niche of the Medfly on a global scale. Three seasonal maps were also produced: January-April, May-August and September-December. Models performed significantly better than random achieving high accuracy scores, indicating a good discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the presence of the species."
https://openalex.org/W1996396973,"There is ample literature available on the association between both time to antibiotics and appropriateness of antibiotics and clinical outcomes from sepsis. In fact, the current state of debate surrounds the balance to be struck between prompt empirical therapy and care in the choice of appropriate antibiotics (both in terms of the susceptibility of infecting organism and minimizing resistance arising from use of broad-spectrum agents). The objective of this study is to determine sepsis bundle compliance and the appropriateness of antimicrobial therapy in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock and its impact on outcomes.This study was conducted in the ICU of a tertiary care, private hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from July 2005 to December 2012 in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.A total of 1,279 patients were identified with severe sepsis and septic shock, of which 358 (32.1%) had bloodstream infection (BSI). The inpatient mortality rate was 29%. In evaluation of the sepsis bundle, over time there was a progressive increase in serum arterial lactate collection, obtaining blood cultures prior to antibiotic administration, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour, and administration of appropriate antimicrobials, with statistically significant differences in the later years of the study. We also observed a significant decrease in mortality. In patients with bloodstream infection, after adjustment for other covariates the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy was associated with a decrease in mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock (p = 0.023).The administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy was independently associated with a decline in mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock due to bloodstream infection. As protocol adherence increased over time, the crude mortality rate decreased, which reinforces the need to implement institutional guidelines and monitor appropriate antimicrobial therapy compliance."
https://openalex.org/W1999056435,"Within the bone marrow, the endosteal niche plays a crucial role in B-cell differentiation. Because spaceflight is associated with osteoporosis, we investigated whether changes in bone microstructure induced by a ground-based model of spaceflight, hind limb unloading (HU), could affect B lymphopoiesis. To this end, we analyzed both bone parameters and the frequency of early hematopoietic precursors and cells of the B lineage after 3, 6, 13, and 21 d of HU. We found that limb disuse leads to a decrease in both bone microstructure and the frequency of B-cell progenitors in the bone marrow. Although multi-potent hematopoietic progenitors were not affected by HU, a decrease in B lymphopoiesis was observed as of the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) stage with a major block at the progenitor B (pro-B) to precursor B (pre-B) cell transition (5- to 10-fold decrease). The modifications in B lymphopoiesis were similar to those observed in aged mice and, as with aging, decreased B-cell generation in HU mice was associated with reduced expression of B-cell transcription factors, early B-cell factor (EBF) and Pax5, and an alteration in STAT5-mediated IL-7 signaling. These findings demonstrate that mechanical unloading of hind limbs results in a decrease in early B-cell differentiation resembling age-related modifications in B lymphopoiesis.—Lescale, C., Schenten, V., Djeghloul, D., Bennabi, M., Gaignier, F., Vandamme, K., Strazielle, C., Kuzniak, I., Petite, H., Dosquet, C., Frippiat, J.-P., Goodhardt, M.

https://openalex.org/W2059661088,"Some tick populations have increased dramatically in the past several decades leading to an increase in the incidence and emergence of tick-borne diseases. Management strategies that can effectively reduce tick populations while better understanding regional tick phenology is needed. One promising management strategy is prescribed burning. However, the efficacy of prescribed burning as a mechanism for tick control is unclear because past studies have provided conflicting data, likely due to a failure of some studies to simulate operational management scenarios and/or account for other predictors of tick abundance. Therefore, our study was conducted to increase knowledge of tick population dynamics relative to long-term prescribed fire management. Furthermore, we targeted a region, southwestern Georgia and northwestern Florida (USA), in which little is known regarding tick dynamics so that basic phenology could be determined. Twenty-one plots with varying burn regimes (burned surrounded by burned [BB], burned surrounded by unburned [BUB], unburned surrounded by burned [UBB], and unburned surrounded by unburned [UBUB]) were sampled monthly for two years while simultaneously collecting data on variables that can affect tick abundance (e.g., host abundance, vegetation structure, and micro- and macro-climatic conditions). In total, 47,185 ticks were collected, of which, 99% were Amblyomma americanum, 0.7% were Ixodes scapularis, and fewer numbers of Amblyomma maculatum, Ixodes brunneus, and Dermacentor variabilis. Monthly seasonality trends were similar between 2010 and 2011. Long-term prescribed burning consistently and significantly reduced tick counts (overall and specifically for A. americanum and I. scapularis) regardless of the burn regimes and variables evaluated. Tick species composition varied according to burn regime with A. americanum dominating at UBUB, A. maculatum at BB, I. scapularis at UBB, and a more even composition at BUB. These data indicate that regular prescribed burning is an effective tool for reducing tick populations and ultimately may reduce risk of tick-borne disease."
https://openalex.org/W1981738343,"Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS) is the first pathway-specific enzyme in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins, the most widely used plant-derived pesticide. CDS catalyzes c1′-2-3 cyclopropanation reactions of two molecules of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) to yield chrysanthemyl diphosphate (CPP). Three proteins are known to catalyze this cyclopropanation reaction of terpene precursors. Two of them, phytoene and squalene synthase, are bifunctional enzymes with both prenyltransferase and terpene synthase activity. CDS, the other member, has been reported to perform only the prenyltransferase step. Here we show that the NDXXD catalytic motif of CDS, under the lower substrate conditions prevalent in plants, also catalyzes the next step, converting CPP into chrysanthemol by hydrolyzing the diphosphate moiety. The enzymatic hydrolysis reaction followed conventional Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a Km value for CPP of 196 μm. For the chrysanthemol synthase activity, DMAPP competed with CPP as substrate. The DMAPP concentration required for half-maximal activity to produce chrysanthemol was ∼100 μm, and significant substrate inhibition was observed at elevated DMAPP concentrations. The N-terminal peptide of CDS was identified as a plastid-targeting peptide. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing CDS emitted chrysanthemol at a rate of 0.12–0.16 μg h−1 g−1 fresh weight. We propose that CDS should be renamed a chrysanthemol synthase utilizing DMAPP as substrate.Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS) is known to catalyze the formation of the irregular terpenoid, chrysanthemyl diphosphate (CPP).ResultsCDS also catalyzes the next step from CPP to chrysanthemol.ConclusionCDS is actually a chrysanthemol synthase (CHS) with bifunctional enzyme activity.SignificanceIdentification of CHS increases our understanding in terpene biosynthesis and paves the way for engineering biosynthesis of the most widely used natural pesticide, pyrethrins.

https://openalex.org/W2071520231,"Fos-related antigen 2 (FRA-2/FOSL2) belongs to the AP-1 transcription factor family. Although FOSL2 has been shown to be involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes, very little is known about the signalling pathways that regulate FOSL2 expression and the mechanisms of FOSL2 function. Here, we show that FOSL2 expression is regulated by TGF-β1 and that FOSL2 is required for TGF-β1-induced migration. We demonstrate that FOSL2 interacts with Smad3 in vitro and in vivo and thus up-regulates TGF-β1-induced signalling responses. Mechanistically, FOSL2 promotes P300 binding to Smad3 and the acetylation of Smad3 by P300. Furthermore, we show that the expression of FOSL2 correlates with activated Smad3 expression in clinical non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples. In summary, the present study indicates that FOSL2 facilitates TGF-β1-induced migration by interaction with Smad3 in NSCLC and suggests FOSL2 as a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2028413210,"It was reported that TNF receptor type II signaling, which has the capacity to stimulate CD4+ fork-head box P3+ (Foxp3+) regulatory T cells (Tregs), activated the noncanonical NF-κB pathway in an IKKα-dependent manner. Therefore, we studied the role of IKKα in the homeostasis of Treg population. To this end, we generated a mouse strain with conditional knockout of IKKα in CD4 cells (Ikkaαf/f:CD4.Cre) that showed a >60% reduction in the number of Tregs in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid tissues, whereas the number of Foxp3- effector T cells (Teffs) remained at a normal level. The function of Tregs deficient in IKKα was examined using Rag1-/- mice cotransferred with naive CD4 cells (nCD4s). Although wild-type (WT) Tregs inhibited colitis induced by transfer of WT nCD4s, IKKα-deficient Tregs failed to do so, which was associated with their inability to reconstitute Rag1-/- mice. Furthermore, nCD4s deficient in IKKα also failed to reconstitute Rag1-/- mice and were defective in proliferative responses in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our study reveals a novel role of IKKα in the maintenance of a normal Treg population and in the control of expansion of CD4 T cells. These properties of IKKα may be exploited as therapeutic strategies in the treatment of major human diseases.—Chen, X., Willette-Brown, J., Wu, X., Hu, Y., Howard, O. M. Z., Hu, Y., Oppenheim, J. J.

https://openalex.org/W2008406184,"Triploidy can occur in many animal species but is often lethal. Among invertebrates, amphibians and fishes, triploids are viable although often sterile or infertile. Most triploids of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas are almost sterile (named ""3nβ"") yet a low but significant proportion show an advanced gametogenesis (named ""3nα""). These oysters thus constitute an interesting model to study the effect of triploidy on germ cell development. We used microarrays to compare the gonad transcriptomes of diploid 2n and the abovementioned triploid 3nβ and 3nα male and female oysters throughout gametogenesis.All triploids displayed an upregulation of genes related to DNA repair and apoptosis and a downregulation of genes associated with cell division. The comparison of 3nα and 3nβ transcriptomes with 2n revealed the likely involvement of a cell cycle checkpoint during mitosis in the successful but delayed development of gonads in 3nα individuals. In contrast, a disruption of sex differentiation mechanisms may explain the sterility of 3nβ individuals with 3nβ females expressing male-specific genes and 3nβ males expressing female-specific genes.The disruption of sex differentiation and mitosis may be responsible for the impaired gametogenesis of triploid Pacific oysters. The function of the numerous candidate genes identified in our study should now be studied in detail in order to elucidate their role in sex determination, mitosis/meiosis control, pachytene cell cycle checkpoint, and the control of DNA repair/apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2008740305,"Neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons, can be observed in the adult brain of many mammalian species, including humans. Despite significant progress in our understanding of adult neurogenesis, we are still missing data about the extent and location of production of neural precursors in the adult mammalian brain. We used 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) to map the location of proliferating cells throughout the entire adult mouse brain and found that neurogenesis occurs at two locations in the mouse brain. The larger one we define as the main proliferative zone (MPZ), and the smaller one corresponds to the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. The MPZ can be divided into three parts. The caudate migratory stream (CMS) occupies the middle part of the MPZ. The cable of proliferating cells emanating from the most anterior part of the CMS toward the olfactory bulbs forms the rostral migratory stream. The thin layer of proliferating cells extending posteriorly from the CMS forms the midlayer. We have not found any additional aggregations of proliferating cells in the adult mouse brain that could suggest the existence of other major neurogenic zones in the adult mouse brain."
https://openalex.org/W2091213099,"Background Does poor language ability in early childhood increase the likelihood of physical aggression or is language ability delayed by frequent physical aggression? This study examined the longitudinal associations between physical aggression and language ability from toddlerhood to early childhood in a population sample while controlling for parenting behaviours, non-verbal intellectual functioning, and children’s sex. Methods Children enrolled in the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD) (N = 2, 057) were assessed longitudinally from 17 to 72 months via parent reports and standardized assessments. Results The cross-lagged models revealed modest reciprocal associations between physical aggression and language performance from 17 to 41 months but not thereafter. Conclusions Significant associations between physical aggression and poor language ability are minimal and limited to the period when physical aggression and language performance are both substantially increasing. During that period parenting behaviours may play an important role in supporting language ability while reducing the frequency of physical aggression. Further studies are needed that utilize multiple assessments of physical aggression, assess multiple domains of language abilities, and that examine the potential mediating role of parenting behaviours between 12 and 48 months."

The species was identified by the DNA sequence matching of rpoD. Clinically, the patients with A. dhakensis bacteremia had a higher sepsis-related mortality rate than those with other species (37.5% vs. 0%, P = 0.028). Virulence of different Aeromonas species were tested in C. elegans, mouse fibroblast C2C12 cell line and BALB/c mice models. C. elegans fed with A. dhakensis and A. caviae had the lowest and highest survival rates compared with other species, respectively (all P values <0.0001). A. dhakensis isolates also exhibited more cytotoxicity in C2C12 cell line (all P values <0.0001). Fourteen-day survival rate of mice intramuscularly inoculated with A. dhakensis was lower than that of other species (all P values <0.0001). Hemolytic activity and several virulence factor genes were rarely detected in the A. caviae isolates.Clinical data, ex vivo experiments, and animal studies suggest there is virulence variation among clinically important Aeromonas species."

Our previous studies indicated the potential roles of TIFY10/11 proteins in plant responses to alkaline stress. In the current study, we focused on the regulatory roles and possible physiological and molecular basis of the TIFY10 proteins in plant responses to alkaline stress. We demonstrated the positive function of TIFY10s in alkaline responses by using the AtTIFY10a and AtTIFY10b knockout Arabidopsis, as evidenced by the relatively lower germination rates of attify10a and attify10b mutant seeds under alkaline stress. We also revealed that ectopic expression of GsTIFY10a in Medicago sativa promoted plant growth, and increased the NADP-ME activity, citric acid content and free proline content but decreased the MDA content of transgenic plants under alkaline stress. Furthermore, expression levels of the stress responsive genes including NADP-ME, CS, H+-ppase and P5CS were also up-regulated in GsTIFY10a transgenic plants under alkaline stress. Interestingly, GsTIFY10a overexpression increased the jasmonate content of the transgenic alfalfa. In addition, we showed that neither GsTIFY10a nor GsTIFY10e exhibited transcriptional activity in yeast cells. However, through Y2H and BiFc assays, we demonstrated that GsTIFY10a, not GsTIFY10e, could form homodimers in yeast cells and in living plant cells. As expected, we also demonstrated that GsTIFY10a and GsTIFY10e could heterodimerize with each other in both yeast and plant cells.

https://openalex.org/W2069295886,"This study examines the relative impact of canonical hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha- (HIF-1α and Na+i/K+i-mediated signaling on transcriptomic changes evoked by hypoxia and glucose deprivation. Incubation of RASMC in ischemic conditions resulted in ∼3-fold elevation of [Na+]i and 2-fold reduction of [K+]i. Using global gene expression profiling we found that Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition by ouabain or K+-free medium in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (RASMC) led to the differential expression of dozens of genes whose altered expression was previously detected in cells subjected to hypoxia and ischemia/reperfusion. For further investigations, we selected Cyp1a1, Fos, Atf3, Klf10, Ptgs2, Nr4a1, Per2 and Hes1, i.e. genes possessing the highest increments of expression under sustained Na+,K+-ATPase inhibition and whose implication in the pathogenesis of hypoxia was proved in previous studies. In ouabain-treated RASMC, low-Na+, high-K+ medium abolished amplification of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio as well as the increased expression of all tested genes. In cells subjected to hypoxia and glucose deprivation, dissipation of the transmembrane gradient of Na+ and K+ completely eliminated increment of Fos, Atf3, Ptgs2 and Per2 mRNAs and sharply diminished augmentation expression of Klf10, Edn1, Nr4a1 and Hes1. In contrast to low-Na+, high-K+ medium, RASMC transfection with Hif-1a siRNA attenuated increments of Vegfa, Edn1, Klf10 and Nr4a1 mRNAs triggered by hypoxia but did not impact Fos, Atf3, Ptgs2 and Per2 expression. Thus, our investigation demonstrates, for the first time, that Na+i/K+i-mediated, Hif-1α- -independent excitation-transcription coupling contributes to transcriptomic changes evoked in RASMC by hypoxia and glucose deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W2120717657,"Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the second most important cause of death in the first year of life, and early RSV infections are associated with the development of asthma. Breastfeeding and serum IgG have been shown to protect against RSV infection. Yet, many infants depend on bovine milk-based nutrition, which at present lacks intact immunoglobulins. Objective To investigate whether IgG purified from bovine milk (bIgG) can modulate immune responses against human RSV. Methods ELISAs were performed to analyse binding of bIgG to human respiratory pathogens. bIgG or hRSV was coated to plates to assess dose-dependent binding of bIgG to human Fcγ receptors (FcγR) or bIgG-mediated binding of myeloid cells to hRSV respectively. S. Epidermidis and RSV were used to test bIgG-mediated binding and internalisation of pathogens by myeloid cells. Finally, the ability of bIgG to neutralise infection of HEp2 cells by hRSV was evaluated. Results bIgG recognised human RSV, influenza haemagglutinin and Haemophilus influenza. bIgG bound to FcγRII on neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages, but not to FcγRI and FcγRIII, and could bind simultaneously to hRSV and human FcγRII on neutrophils. In addition, human neutrophils and dendritic cells internalised pathogens that were opsonised with bIgG. Finally, bIgG could prevent infection of HEp2 cells by hRSV. Conclusions The data presented here show that bIgG binds to hRSV and other human respiratory pathogens and induces effector functions through binding to human FcγRII on phagocytes. Thus bovine IgG may contribute to immune protection against RSV."

The quantitative parameters of ONH structure were compared using the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph 2 (HRT2) and Spectralis optical coherence tomography with an enhanced depth imaging method.The mean and maximum cup depths of CON were significantly smaller than those with GON (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The distance between Bruch's membrane opening and anterior surface of the lamina cribrosa (BMO-anterior LC) of CON was also significantly smaller than that of glaucoma but was similar to that of the healthy group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.47, respectively). Based on Moorfields regression analysis of the glaucoma classification of HRT2, 15 eyes with CON were classified with a glaucoma-like disc. The cup/disc area ratio did not differ between cases of CON with a glaucoma-like disc and cases of GON (P = 0.16), but the BMO-anterior LC and mean and maximum cup depths of CON cases with a glaucoma-like disc were smaller than those in GON (P = 0.005, P = 0.003, and P = 0.001, respectively).Measurements of the cup depths and the LC depth had good ability to differentiate between CON with a glaucoma-like disc and glaucoma. There was no laminar remodeling detected by laminar surface position in the patients with CON compared to those with GON."
https://openalex.org/W1996725747,"Induction of autophagy and the integrated stress response is important for amino acid homeostasis. It remains unknown whether the autophagy coregulates both mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and the integrated stress response. In mouse C2C12 myotubes, we found that amino acid limitation induced autophagy and that the subsequent release of amino acid is required to sustain mTORC1 signaling. Inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine treatment during amino acid scarcity abolished mTORC1 signaling, an effect that could be rescued by inhibiting protein synthesis or amino acid supplementation, respectively. Autophagy is required to sustain the balance of both essential and nonessential amino acids during amino acid starvation, and it has a predominant role over the ubiquitinproteasome system in the regulation of mTORC1. Inhibition of autophagy was found to activate the integrated stress response, as well as eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and its target genes independent of amino acid availability. Conversely, autophagy induction via mTOR inhibition is sufficient to reduce eIF2α phosphorylation. Thus, autophagy protects the eIF2α-mediated stress response independent of amino acid supply in cultured myotubes. Our results showed that autophagy uniquely modulates mTORC1 and the integrated stress response in an amino acid-dependent and -independent manner, respectively.—Yu, X., Long, Y. C.

To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 clients waiting for surgical circumcision at clinics in Zambia. Based on Stages of Change behavioral theory, men were asked to recount how they learned about adult circumcision, why they decided it was right for them, what they feared most, how they overcame their fears, and the steps they took to make it to the clinic that day. Thematic analysis across all cases allowed us to identify key behavior change triggers while within-case analysis elucidated variants of one predominant behavior change pattern. Major stages included: awareness and critical belief adjustment, norming pressures and personalization of advantages, a period of fear management and finally VMMC-seeking. Qualitative comparative analysis of ever-married and never-married men revealed important similarities and differences between the two groups. Unprompted, 17 of the men described one to four failed prior attempts to become circumcised. Experienced more frequently by older men, failed VMMC attempts were often due to service-side barriers. Findings highlight intervention opportunities to increase VMMC uptake. Reaching uncircumcised men via close male friends and female sex partners and tailoring messages to stage-specific concerns and needs would help accelerate men's movement through the behavior change process. Expanding service access is also needed to meet current demand. Improving clinic efficiencies and introducing time-saving procedures and advance scheduling options should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2335625640,"Influenza virus infection is a common reason for visits to the emergency department (ED) during the influenza season. A rapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza virus infection is important to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescription and to improve patient care. The aim of this study was to examine whether using the Influenza Virus Rapid Antigen Test (IVRAT) in the ED affects the decision to prescribe antibiotics or the length of hospital stay (LOS).Data from patients suffering from an influenza-like illness (ILI) and who were discharged after visiting the ED at Chungbuk National University Hospital were reviewed over two influenza seasons: 2010-2011, when IVRAT was not used in the ED, and 2011-2012, when it was. The numbers of antibiotic prescriptions issued and the ED LOS during these two seasons were then compared.The number of antibiotic prescriptions was significantly lower in 2011-2012 (54/216, 25.0%) than in 2010-2011 (97/221, 43.9%; P<0.01). However, the median ED LOS for patients in 2011-2012 was much longer than that of patients in 2010-2011 (213 minutes vs. 257 minutes; P<0.01). During the 2011-2012 influenza season, 73 ILI patients showed a positive IVRAT result whereas 123 showed a negative result. Upon discharge, antibiotics were given to 42/123 (34.1%) ILI patients with a negative IVRAT result, but to only 7/73 (9.6%) patients with a positive IVRAT result (P<0.01).Performing IVRAT in the ED reduced the prescription of antibiotics to ILI patients discharged after ED care. However, the ED LOS for patients who underwent IVRAT was longer than that for patients who did not. Thus, performing IVRAT in the ED reduces the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics to ILI patients during the influenza season."
https://openalex.org/W2042969229,"Fronto-striatal circuits are hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Within this circuitry, ventral frontal regions project fibers to the ventral striatum (VS) and dorsal frontal regions to the dorsal striatum. Resting state fMRI research has shown higher functional connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the dorsal part of the VS in OCD patients compared to healthy controls (HC). Therefore, we hypothesized that in OCD the OFC predominantly project fibers to the more dorsal part of the VS, and that the structural connectivity between the OFC and VS is higher compared to HC. A total of 20 non-medicated OCD patients and 20 HC underwent diffusion-weighted imaging. Connectivity-based parcellation analyses were performed with the striatum as seed region and the OFC, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex as target regions. Obtained connectivity maps for each frontal region of interest (ROI) were normalized into standard space, and Z-component (dorsal–ventral) coordinate of center-of-gravity (COG) were compared between two groups. Probabilistic tractography was performed to investigate diffusion indices of fibers between the striatum and frontal ROIs. COG Z-component coordinates of connectivity maps for OFC ROI were located in the more dorsal part of the VS in OCD patients compared to HC. Fractional anisotropy of fibers between the OFC and the striatum was higher in OCD patients compared to HC. Part of the pathophysiology of OCD might be understood by altered topography and structural connectivity of fibers between the OFC and the striatum."
https://openalex.org/W2101316765,"We re-isolated in China a relative of the nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans that was previously referred to informally as C. sp. 5. In spite of its importance for comparative biology, C. sp. 5 has remained morphologically uncharacterized. Therefore, we now provide detailed description of morphology and anatomy, assigning the name of Caenorhabditis sinica sp. n. to this nematode that is found frequently in China. C. sinica sp. n. belongs to the Elegans group in the genus Caenorhabditis, being phylogenetically close to C. briggsae although differing in reproductive mode. The gonochoristic C. sinica sp. n. displays two significantly larger distal parts of uteri filled with sperms in the female/hermaphroditic gonad than does the androdioecious C. briggsae. The new species can be differentiated morphologically from all known Caenorhabditis species within the Elegans group by presenting a uniquely shaped, three-pointed hook structure on the male precloacal lip. The lateral field of C. sinica sp. n. is marked by three ridges that are flanked by two additional incisures, sometimes appearing as five ridges in total. This study ends the prolonged period of the ‘undescribed’ anonymity for C. sinica sp. n. since its discovery and use in comparative biological research. Significant and crossing-direction dependent hybrid incompatibilities in F1 and F2 crossing progeny make C. sinica sp. n. an excellent model for studies of population and speciation genetics. The abundance of nematode species lacking detailed taxonomic characterization deserves renewed attention to address the species description gap for this important yet morphologically ‘difficult’ group of animals."
https://openalex.org/W1985430081,"Although both an active form of the vitamin D metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D3, and the vitamin D analogue, ED71 have been used to treat osteoporosis, anti-bone resorbing activity is reportedly seen only in ED71- but not in 1,25(OH)2D3 -treated patients. In addition, how ED71 inhibits osteoclast activity in patients has not been fully characterized. Recently, HIF1α expression in osteoclasts was demonstrated to be required for development of post-menopausal osteoporosis. Here we show that ED71 but not 1,25(OH)2D3, suppress HIF1α protein expression in osteoclasts in vitro. We found that 1,25(OH)2D3 or ED71 function in osteoclasts requires the vitamin D receptor (VDR). ED71 was significantly less effective in inhibiting M-CSF and RANKL-stimulated osteoclastogenesis than was 1,25(OH)2D3 in vitro. Downregulation of c-Fos protein and induction of Ifnβ mRNA in osteoclasts, both of which reportedly block osteoclastogenesis induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in vitro, were both significantly higher following treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 than with ED71. Thus, suppression of HIF1α protein activity in osteoclasts in vitro, which is more efficiently achieved by ED71 rather than by 1,25(OH)2D3, could be a reliable read-out in either developing or screening reagents targeting osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2032001137,"In aquatic ecosystems, predation is affected both by turbulence and visibility, but the combined effects are poorly known. Both factors are changing in lakes in the Northern Hemisphere; the average levels of turbulence are predicted to increase due to increasing wind activities, while water transparency is decreasing, e.g., due to variations in precipitation, and sediment resuspension. We explored experimentally how turbulence influenced the effects of planktivorous fish and invertebrate predators on zooplankton when it was combined with low visibility caused by high levels of water color. The study was conducted as a factorial design in 24 outdoor ponds, using the natural zooplankton community as a prey population. Perch and roach were used as vertebrate predators and Chaoborus flavicans larvae as invertebrate predators. In addition to calm conditions, the turbulent dissipation rate used in the experiments was 10−6 m2 s−3, and the water color was 140 mg Pt L−1. The results demonstrated that in a system dominated by invertebrates, predation pressure on cladocerans increased considerably under intermediate turbulence. Under calm conditions, chaoborids caused only a minor reduction in the crustacean biomass. The effect of fish predation on cladocerans was slightly reduced by turbulence, while predation on cyclopoids was strongly enhanced. Surprisingly, under turbulent conditions fish reduced cyclopoid biomass, whereas in calm water it increased in the presence of fish. We thus concluded that turbulence affects fish selectivity. The results suggested that in dystrophic invertebrate-dominated lakes, turbulence may severely affect the abundance of cladocerans. In fish-dominated dystrophic lakes, on the other hand, turbulence-induced changes in planktivory may considerably affect copepods instead of cladocerans. In lakes inhabited by both invertebrates and fish, the response of top-down regulation to turbulence resembles that in fish-dominated systems, due to intraguild predation. The changes in planktivorous predation induced by abiotic factors may possibly cascade to primary producers."

However, transcriptomic and genomic data for Jerusalem artichoke remain scarce. In this study, Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on samples from Jerusalem artichoke leaves, roots, stems and two different tuber tissues (early and late tuber development). Data were used for de novo assembly and characterization of the transcriptome. In total 206,215,632 paired-end reads were generated. These were assembled into 66,322 loci with 272,548 transcripts. Loci were annotated by querying against the NCBI non-redundant, Phytozome and UniProt databases, and 40,215 loci were homologous to existing database sequences. Gene Ontology terms were assigned to 19,848 loci, 15,434 loci were matched to 25 Clusters of Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups classifications, and 11,844 loci were classified into 142 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. The assembled loci also contained 10,778 potential simple sequence repeats. The newly assembled transcriptome was used to identify loci with tissue-specific differential expression patterns. In total, 670 loci exhibited tissue-specific expression, and a subset of these were confirmed using RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. Gene expression related to inulin biosynthesis in tuber tissue was also investigated. Exsiting genetic and genomic data for H. tuberosus are scarce. The sequence resources developed in this study will enable the analysis of thousands of transcripts and will thus accelerate marker-assisted breeding studies and studies of inulin biosynthesis in Jerusalem artichoke."
https://openalex.org/W2004481403,"Microcystins LR (MC-LR) are hepatotoxic cyanotoxins that have been shown to induce reproductive toxicity, and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis (HPG) is responsible for the control of reproductive functions. However, few studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of MC-LR on HPG axis. This study aimed to investigate the MC-LR-induced toxicity in the reproductive system of mouse and focus on the HPG axis.Adult male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to various concentrations of MC-LR (0, 3.75, 7.50, 15.00 and 30.00 µg/kg body weight per day) for 1 to 14 days, and it was found that exposure to different concentrations of MC-LR significantly disturbed sperm production in the mice testes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To elucidate the associated possible mechanisms, the serum levels of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were assessed. Meanwhile, PCR assays were employed to detect alterations in a series of genes involved in HPG axis, such as FSH, LH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and their complement receptors. Furthermore, the effect of MC-LR on the viability and testosterone production of Leydig cells were tested in vitro.MC-LR significantly impaired the spermatogenesis of mice possibly through the direct or indirect inhibition of GnRH synthesis at the hypothalamic level, which resulted in reduction of serum levels of LH that lead to suppression of testosterone production in the testis of mice.MC-LR may be a GnRH toxin that would disrupt the reproductive system of mice."
https://openalex.org/W2063022312,"Electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in multiple frequency bands can be observed during functional activity of the cerebral cortex. An important question is whether activity of focal areas of cortex, such as during finger movements, is tracked by focal oscillatory EEG changes. Although a number of studies have compared EEG changes to functional MRI hemodynamic responses, we can find no previous research that relates the fMRI hemodynamic activity to localization of the multiple EEG frequency changes observed in motor tasks. In the present study, five participants performed similar thumb and finger movement tasks in parallel EEG and functional MRI studies. We examined changes in five frequency bands (from 5-120 Hz) and localized them using 256 dense-array EEG (dEEG) recordings and high-resolution individual head models. These localizations were compared with fMRI localizations in the same participants. Results showed that beta-band (14-30 Hz) desynchronizations (power decreases) were the most robust effects, appearing in all individuals, consistently localized to the hand region of the primary motor cortex, and consistently aligned with fMRI localizations."

This new type of inhibition may have widespread utility in targeting neuropeptidases. Zinc metallopeptidases are one of the largest classes of enzymes that hydrolyze peptide bonds, with members widely distributed throughout all the kingdoms of life (1.Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. MEROPS: the peptidase database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D160-D164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They play vital roles in both development and maintenance of the mature organism and are of considerable interest as therapeutic targets for a range of human disorders. Recently, there have been extensive efforts to develop inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases, which degrade collagen and other components of connective tissue, because of their role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis as well as inflammatory processes associated with arthritis and cardiovascular disease (2.Ketelhuth D.F.

A key function of ACE and other members of the specialized group of metallopeptidases termed neuropeptidases is to regulate and metabolize the hundreds of known bioactive peptides that act as signaling molecules in the central nervous system and periphery (5.Konkoy C.S. Davis T.P. Ectoenzymes as sites of peptide regulation.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 288-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These enzymes are restricted to oligopeptide substrates, and they can be either exo- or endopeptidases. The group includes neurolysin (E.C. 3.4.24.16), a 78-kDa enzyme widely distributed in mammalian tissues and found in various subcellular compartments depending on cell type (6.Barrett A.J.

This fold therefore appears to be a widespread adaptation of the thermolysin domain that restricts these enzymes to short oligopeptide substrates. Comparison of the known crystal structures of enzymes with the neurolysin/TOP-fold suggests that a substantial conformational change is stabilized by substrate or substrate-analog binding (21.Comellas-Bigler M.

A conformational change associated with the catalytic cycle thus may be inherent to this group of metallopeptidases. Inhibition of neuropeptidases is an effective approach for modulating the levels of their neuropeptide substrates or products, as demonstrated by the ACE inhibitors (4.Meier P. Maillard M. Burnier M.

These compounds, like nearly all known metallopeptidase inhibitors, bind at the catalytic site and coordinate the zinc ion cofactor. As such, they carry phosphinic or carboxylic acid moieties that result in little or no brain penetration with oral administration. Conversion of these types of inhibitors into effective therapeutics has been problematic, and new classes of compounds are needed to expand the targeting of neuropeptidases and metallopeptidases in general. We report here the characterization of an inhibitor of neurolysin that binds remotely from the catalytic site and reduces enzyme activity by an allosteric mechanism. This and related compounds represent a promising new class of inhibitors that should prove useful with other members of this zinc metallopeptidase group. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on 600 or 300 MHz instruments using CDCl3 as solvent with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Chemical shifts are given in parts per million (ppm) (d scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane. Coupling constants (J) are expressed in hertz (Hz). Flash chromatography was performed using Silica Gel 60 (0.040–0.063 mm, Merck). Mass spectra were recorded on a Micromass QTOF-2 instrument with MassLynx application software for acquisition and reconstruction of the data. Exact mass measurement by HRMS was done of the quasimolecular ion [M + H]+. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 2-chlorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride (R4) (20.0 g, 111.7 mmol) was added to a mixture of water (5.0 ml) and acetic acid (60 ml) at 0 °C. Then 12.3 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was added. 2-Chlorostyrene (R3) (15.4 g, 111.4 mmol) and paraformaldehyde (3.4 g, 113 mmol) were added to the mixture portionwise. After 1 h at 0 °C the mixture was left overnight with stirring at ambient temperature. Then the reaction mixture was poured onto water (∼200 ml) at 0 °C, and the whole mixture was extracted with Et2O (2 × 100 ml). Layers were separated and the water layer was brought to pH > 10 (50% NaOH) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 100 ml). The combined organic fractions were dried on MgSO4. Removal of the drying agent by filtration and concentration in vacuo of the filtrate yielded 25 g of a yellow oil containing R5. This was used in the next step without further purification as R5 is unstable. Pyrazolidine (R5) (5.0 g, 17.1 mmol) and Boc-glycine (R6) (3.0 g, 17.1 mmol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (65 ml). Dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (4.6 g, 22.2 mmol, 1.3 eq) was added. After stirring overnight the suspension was filtered and the residue was washed with acetonitrile. The combined organic fractions were concentrated in vacuo and the residue was subjected to flash column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: CH2Cl2, then CH2Cl2/MeOH, 9:1). CH2Cl2 elution gave apolar fractions containing byproducts, during CH2Cl2/MeOH, 9:1, elution pure fractions containing R7 were obtained. After concentration in vacuo, 6.0 g of R7 was isolated as a glass. The Boc protected R7 (6.0 g, 13.3 mmol) was dissolved in dry CH3CN (35 ml) under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then Me3SiCl (2.53 ml, 20 mmol, 1.5 eq) was added followed by KI (3.3 g, 20 mmol, 1.5 eq). The mixture was stirred for 16 h after which 200 ml of 5% NaHCO3/H2O and 350 ml of EtOAc were added. Vigorous stirring was continued for 1.5 h. Solid material was removed by filtration, and the organic layer dried on MgSO4. Removal of the drying agent by filtration and concentration in vacuo of the filtrate yielded 4.6 g of the desired product R8. This was used in the next step without further purification. 4.6 g (13.1 mmol) of R8 was dissolved with slight heating in CH3CN (65 ml). At room temperature, a suspension of isocyanate R9 (2.33 g, 13.1 mmol, 1 eq) in CH3CN (20 ml) was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was stirred overnight and filtered to yield 4.3 g of a white solid that was subjected to column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: EtOAc). This gave 2.7 g of a white solid that was recrystallized from CH3CN (175 ml), yielding 1.9 g of pure R1 melting point 163–6 °C. 2-Fluorophenylhydrazine hydrochloride R10 (25 g, 153.8 mmol) was added to a mixture of water (3.8 ml), acetic acid (31 ml), and sulfuric acid (12.5 ml) at 0 °C. 2-Chlorostyrene (R3) (21.3 g, 153.8 mmol) and 90% paraformaldehyde (5.1 g, 153.8 mmol) were added to the mixture. After 1 h at 0 °C the mixture was left overnight with stirring at ambient temperature. The resulting dark brown solution was diluted with water (100 ml), while maintaining the temperature below 5 °C with an ice-water bath. Non-acid soluble side products were extracted with diethyl ether (150 ml). The aqueous layer was made alkaline with sodium hydroxide solution (33%, 100 ml) and the liberated pyrazolidine (R11) was extracted with TBME (1 × 200 ml, 2 × 100 ml). Combined extracts were washed with water (50 ml) and brine (50 ml). After drying with sodium sulfate the solvent was evaporated to leave a brownish oil (38.9 g, 85%). HPLC-MS: (M35Cl + H)+ 277.1, (M37Cl + H)+ 279.2, 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz, δ ppm): 1.8–2.0 (1H, m), 2.9–3.0 (1H, m), 3.0–3.1 (1H, m), 3.2–3.4 (2H, m), 5.0 (1H, d), 6.8–7.7 (8H, m). The oil was used in the next step without purification. Storage at −20 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere was used to slow down the oxidation of the pyrazolidine nucleus. Pyrazolidine (R11) (4.44 g, 16.1 mmol) and Boc-l-alanine (R12, 3.05 g, 16.1 mmol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (50 ml). Dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (4.2 g, 20.4 mmol) was added. A colorless solid (dicyclohexylurea) was immediately precipitated. After stirring overnight the suspension was filtered and the residue was washed with acetonitrile. The combined filtrates were concentrated in vacuo to yield 8.87 g of a sticky amber mass. Solvent gradient chromatography (ethyl acetate/heptane, 1:4) yielded two fractions (fraction 1: 2.7 g (S)-R13, fraction 2: 1.4 g (R)-R13). HPLC-MS: (M35Cl + H)+ 448.2, (M37Cl + H)+ 450.2. The latter fraction ((R)-R13) was used in the next step. 1.25 g (3.6 mmol) of Boc-amine (R)-R13 was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane/water (70:25:5, v/v/v) and stirred for 2.5 h. Evaporation of the solvents yielded the crude amine (R)-R14 (0.69 g, 37%). HPLC-MS: (M35Cl + H)+ 348.2, (M37Cl + H)+ 350.3. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz, δ ppm): 1.3 (3H, d), 1.7 (s(br), 2H), 2.2–2.3 (1H, m), 2.7–2.8 (1H, m), 3.7–3.9 (1H, m), 3.9–4.3 (2H, m), 5.0 (1H, d), 6.9–7.5 (8H, m). 0.65 g (1.86 mmol) of (R)-R14 was suspended in acetonitrile (15 ml). 2-Adamantane isocyanate (R9) (0.33 g, 1.86 mmol) was added in one portion to the suspension and stirring was continued for 4 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness and the residue was purified via solvent gradient chromatography yielding a colorless product containing R2 (0.61 g, 62%). HPLC-MS: (M35Cl + H)+ 525.2, (M37Cl + H)+ 527.3. 1H NMR (CDCl3/dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 1:5 (v/v), 600 MHz, δ ppm): 1.34 (d, J = 6 Hz, 3H), 1.4–1.9 (m, 14H), 2.20 + 2.62(2m, 2H), 3.61 (m, 1H), 4.02(m, 2H), 4.53 (m, 1H), 4.90 (m, 1H), 7.02 (2m, 1H), 7.10 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), 7.16 (m, 1H), 7.19 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), 7.29 (t, J = 7.5, 1H), 7.44 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), 7.53 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H). 13C NMR(CDCl3/dimethyl sulfoxide-d6, 1:5, 150 MHz, δ ppm): 19.3, 27.5, 27.6, 32.0(3), 33.0(2), 37.7(2), 38.1, 45.5, 47.5, 53.7, 67.2, 117.1 (JCF = 21 Hz), 118.4, 124.4 (JCF = 8 Hz), 125.3 Hz, 127.8, 128.3, 129.5, 129.9, 131.5, 138.7 (JCF = 8 Hz), 139.7, 153.3 (JCF = 244 Hz), 157.6, 171.0. HRMS (C29H35N4O235ClF) [M + H]+: found m/z 525.2447, calculated 525.2433. Note: the amide bond gives rise to two rotamers, and the 1H NMR data belong to the most abundant rotamer. Both NMR experiments were conducted at 10 °C. The rat neurolysin used is a point variant of the construct employed in previous studies (18.Brown C.K. Madauss K. Lian W. Beck M.R. Tolbert W.D.

Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1644-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In this variant, which was expressed in Escherichia coli using a pBAD/His vector (Invitrogen), a surface histidine (His-160) involved in a divalent cation-mediated lattice contact in the original neurolysin crystals was converted to an alanine during attempts to obtain new crystal forms. The H160A mutation, as well as the E475A mutation of the catalytic glutamate residue, were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Primers for generating neurolysin mutant constructs were obtained from Operon Biotechnologies, Inc. and diluted with distilled water to 100 ng/ml. Reactions consisted of 5 ml of 3.5 ng/ml of template, 1.25 ml of each primer at 100 ng/ml, 1.0 ml of 20 mm dNTP mixture, 5 ml of 10× Pfu Reaction Buffer, 35.5 ml of distilled water, and 1 ml of Pfu DNA polymerase at 2.5 units/ml. Methylated template DNA was then digested by adding 1 ml of DpnI to the reaction tube and incubating at 37 °C for 2 h. The product was run at the expected linearized size of 6.1 kb on an agarose gel. PCR DNA was ligated overnight at room temperature (5 ml of DNA, 1 ml of reaction buffer, 3 ml of distilled water, and 1 ml of T4 DNA ligase) then transformed into TOP10 E. coli competent cells (Invitrogen). The pBAD/His neurolysin H160A and E475A constructs were sequenced (University of California Davis DNA Sequencing Facility) to confirm the desired mutations and the absence of any unwanted substitutions. Protein expression and purification were performed as described previously (18.Brown C.K. Madauss K. Lian W. Beck M.R. Tolbert W.D. Rodgers D.W.

Optimized crystals were produced by hanging drop vapor diffusion, mixing 2 ml of 48 mm protein in the presence of 5-fold stoichiometric excess of inhibitor R2 with 1 ml of well solution containing 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 m LiSO4, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 12–15% polyethylene glycol 4000. The stock solution of R2 was 5 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide. Crystals were grown at 4 °C and formed as individual, rhombohedral plates with dimensions ∼100 mm × 200 mm × 10 mm. Crystals were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen after soaking for about 5 s in a solution having the same composition as the well solution plus 20% polyethylene glycol 400. Data were collected at −160 °C at the Structural Biology Center (SBC) beamline 19-ID and the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) beamline 22-ID of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, and reduced using HKL2000 (33.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38555) Google Scholar). Data were integrated to 2.8 Å with an overall Rsym of 14.7% (Table 1). The two molecules of neurolysin in the asymmetric unit were built and refined independently using CNS (34.Brünger A.T.

https://openalex.org/W2064927819,"Amniotic membrane-based tissue-engineered corneal epithelium has been widely used in the reconstruction of the ocular surface. However, it often degrades too early to ensure the success of the transplanted corneal epithelium when treating patients with severe ocular surface disorders. In the present study, we investigated the preparation of xenogeneic acellular conjunctiva matrix (aCM) and evaluated its efficacy and safety as a scaffold of tissue-engineered corneal epithelium. Native porcine conjunctiva was decellularized with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 12 h at 37°C and sterilized via γ-irradiation. Compared with native conjunctiva, more than 92% of the DNA was removed, and more than 90% of the extracellular matrix components (glycosaminoglycan and collagen) remained after the decellularization treatment. Compared with denuded amniotic membrane (dAM), the aCM possessed favorable optical transmittance, tensile strength, stability and biocompatibility as well as stronger resistance to degradation both in vitro and in vivo. The corneal epithelial cells seeded on aCM formed a multilayered epithelial structure and endured longer than did those on dAM. The aCM-based tissue-engineered corneal epithelium was more effective in the reconstruction of the ocular surface in rabbits with limbal stem cell deficiency. These findings support the application of xenogeneic acellular conjunctiva matrix as a scaffold for reconstructing the ocular surface."
https://openalex.org/W2092098513,"As part of our drug discovery program for anti-filarial agents from Indian medicinal plants, leaves of Eucalyptus tereticornis were chemically investigated, which resulted in the isolation and characterization of an anti-filarial agent, ursolic acid (UA) as a major constituent. Antifilarial activity of UA against the human lymphatic filarial parasite Brugia malayi using in vitro and in vivo assays, and in silico docking search on glutathione-s-transferase (GST) parasitic enzyme were carried out. The UA was lethal to microfilariae (mf; LC100: 50; IC50: 8.84 µM) and female adult worms (LC100: 100; IC50: 35.36 µM) as observed by motility assay; it exerted 86% inhibition in MTT reduction potential of the adult parasites. The selectivity index (SI) of UA for the parasites was found safe. This was supported by the molecular docking studies, which showed adequate docking (LibDock) scores for UA (−8.6) with respect to the standard antifilarial drugs, ivermectin (IVM −8.4) and diethylcarbamazine (DEC-C −4.6) on glutathione-s-transferase enzyme. Further, in silico pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness studies showed that UA possesses drug-like properties. Furthermore, UA was evaluated in vivo in B. malayi-M. coucha model (natural infection), which showed 54% macrofilaricidal activity, 56% female worm sterility and almost unchanged microfilaraemia maintained throughout observation period with no adverse effect on the host. Thus, in conclusion in vitro, in silico and in vivo results indicate that UA is a promising, inexpensive, widely available natural lead, which can be designed and developed into a macrofilaricidal drug. To the best of our knowledge this is the first ever report on the anti-filarial potential of UA from E. tereticornis, which is in full agreement with the Thomson Reuter's ‘Metadrug’ tool screening predictions."
https://openalex.org/W2045396550,"Purpose This study analyzed the clinicopathologic characteristics of typical medullary breast carcinoma (TMBC) in a cohort of Chinese patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of clinical data including general information, pathologic results, treatment regimens, and patient survival in cases of TMBC diagnosed between February 2004 and April 2011. Results A total of 117 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 52 years (range, 28∼92 years). Stage I and II disease accounted for 31.6% and 61.6% of the cases, respectively. Hormonal receptor negative disease (estrogen receptor negative, 68.4%; progestogen receptor negative, 86.3%) was more prevalent in this population. Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) positivity was 20.5%, while equivocal and HER-2 negative cases represented 16.2% and 63.2% of the cohort. The triple-negative, luminal, and HER-2 overexpressing subtypes constituted 44.4%, 31.6%, and 15.4% of the cases, respectively. The various TMBC subtypes showed no differences regarding tumor size, rates of lymph node(s) metastasis, TNM staging, treatment regimens, and 2-year recurrence rates. However, patients with triple-negative disease were more likely to be younger, when compared to those with luminal disease (P = 0.002). At a median follow-up of 56 months (range, 2–112 months), the 2-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 99.1% and 98.2%, respectively. Conclusion Early stage disease dominated the study cohort, and at two years after surgery, recurrence was extremely low. The heterogeneity of molecular subtypes was clearly shown, and no apparent differences were found among the clinicopathologic characteristics of the triple-negative, luminal, and HER-2 overexpressing subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W2035726238,"Objective To determine the clinical manifestations and outcomes, the reliability of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S ser. Typhi) IgM and IgG rapid tests, and the susceptibility patterns and the response to treatment during the 2009–2011 typhoid outbreak in Songkhla province in Thailand. Method The medical records of children aged <15 years with S ser. Typhi bacteremia were analysed. The efficacy of the typhoid IgM and IgG rapid tests and susceptibility of the S ser. Typhi to the current main antibiotics used for typhoid (amoxicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, co-trimoxazole, and ciprofloxacin), were evaluated. Results S ser. Typhi bacteremia was found in 368 patients, and all isolated strains were susceptible to all 6 antimicrobials tested. Most of the patients were treated with ciprofloxacin for 7–14 days. The median time (IQR) of fever before treatment and duration of fever after treatment were 5 (4, 7) days and 4 (3, 5) days, respectively. Complications of ascites, lower respiratory symptoms, anemia (Hct <30%), and ileal perforation were found in 7, 7, 22, and 1 patients, respectively. None of the patients had recurrent infection or died. The sensitivities of the typhoid IgM and IgG tests were 58.3% and 25.6% respectively, and specificities were 74.1% and 50.5%, respectively. Conclusion Most of the patients were diagnosed at an early stage and treated with a good outcome. All S ser. Typhi strains were susceptible to standard first line antibiotic typhoid treatment. The typhoid IgM and IgG rapid tests had low sensitivity and moderate specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2044542343,"Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a potent oxidant generated by myeloperoxidase (MPO), which is an abundant enzyme used for defense against microbes. We examined the potential role of HOCl in corrin ring destruction and subsequent formation of cyanogen chloride (CNCl) from dicyanocobinamide ((CN)2-Cbi). Stopped-flow analysis revealed that the reaction consists of at least three observable steps, including at least two sequential transient intermediates prior to corrin ring destruction. The first two steps were attributed to sequential replacement of the two cyanide ligands with hypochlorite, while the third step was the destruction of the corrin ring. The formation of (OCl)(CN)-Cbi and its conversion to (OCl)2-Cbi was fitted to a first order rate equation with second order rate constants of 0.002 and 0.0002 µM(-1) s(-1), respectively. The significantly lower rate of the second step compared to the first suggests that the replacement of the first cyanide molecule by hypochlorite causes an alteration in the ligand trans effects changing the affinity and/or accessibility of Co toward hypochlorite. Plots of the apparent rate constants as a function of HOCl concentration for all the three steps were linear with Y-intercepts close to zero, indicating that HOCl binds in an irreversible one-step mechanism. Collectively, these results illustrate functional differences in the corrin ring environments toward binding of diatomic ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2162216930,"The field of health literacy continues to evolve and concern public health researchers and yet remains a largely overlooked concept elsewhere in the healthcare system. We conducted focus group discussions in England UK, about the concept of health literacy with older patients with chronic musculoskeletal conditions (mean age = 73.4 years), carers and health professionals. Our research posed methodological, intellectual and practical challenges. Gaps in conceptualisation and expectations were revealed, reiterating deficiencies in predominant models for understanding health literacy and methodological shortcomings of using focus groups in qualitative research for this topic. Building on this unique insight into what the concept of health literacy meant to participants, we present analysis of our findings on factors perceived to foster and inhibit health literacy and on the issue of responsibility in health literacy. Patients saw health literacy as a result of an inconsistent interactive process and the implications as wide ranging; healthcare professionals had more heterogeneous views. All focus group discussants agreed that health literacy most benefited from good inter-personal communication and partnership. By proposing a needs-based approach to health literacy we offer an alternative way of conceptualising health literacy to help improve the health of older people with chronic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1992744122,"A critical step in the analysis of images is identifying the area of interest e.g. nuclei. When the nuclei are brighter than the remainder of the image an intensity can be chosen to identify the nuclei. Intensity thresholding is complicated by variations in the intensity of individual nuclei and their intensity relative to their surroundings. To compensate thresholds can be based on local rather than global intensities. By testing local thresholding methods we found that the local mean performed poorly while the Phansalkar method and a new method based on identifying the local background were superior. A new colocalization coefficient, the Hcoef, highlights a number of controversial issues. (i) Are molecular interactions measurable (ii) whether to include voxels without fluorophores in calculations, and (iii) the meaning of negative correlations. Negative correlations can arise biologically (a) because the two fluorophores are in different places or (b) when high intensities of one fluorophore coincide with low intensities of a second. The cases are distinct and we argue that it is only relevant to measure correlation using pixels that contain both fluorophores and, when the fluorophores are in different places, to just report the lack of co-occurrence and omit these uninformative negative correlation. The Hcoef could report molecular interactions in a homogenous medium. But biology is not homogenous and distributions also reflect physico-chemical properties, targeted delivery and retention. The Hcoef actually measures a mix of correlation and co-occurrence, which makes its interpretation problematic and in the absence of a convincing demonstration we advise caution, favouring separate measurements of correlation and of co-occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2057184329,"Pyramidal neurons in the mammalian forebrain receive their synaptic inputs through their dendritic trees, and dendritic spines are the sites of most excitatory synapses. Dendritic spine structure is important for brain development and plasticity. Kalirin-7 is a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for the small GTPase Rac1 and is a critical regulator of dendritic spine remodeling. The subcellular localization of kalirin-7 is thought to be important for regulating its function in neurons. A yeast two-hybrid screen has identified the adaptor protein X11α as an interacting partner of kalirin-7. Here, we show that kalirin-7 and X11α form a complex in the brain, and this interaction is mediated by the C terminus of kalirin-7. Kalirin-7 and X11α co-localize at excitatory synapses in cultured cortical neurons. Using time-lapse imaging of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we show that X11α is present in a mobile fraction of the postsynaptic density. X11α also localizes to Golgi outposts in dendrites, and its overexpression induces the removal of kalirin-7 from spines and accumulation of kalirin-7 in Golgi outposts. In addition, neurons overexpressing X11α displayed thinner spines. These data support a novel mechanism of regulation of kalirin-7 localization and function in dendrites, providing insight into signaling pathways underlying neuronal plasticity. Dissecting the molecular mechanisms of synaptic structural plasticity will improve our understanding of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, as kalirin-7 has been associated with schizophrenia and Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2133418005,"Many animals copy the choices of others but the functional and mechanistic explanations for copying are still not fully resolved. We relied on novel behavioral protocols to quantify the value of patch-choice copying in fruit flies. In a titration experiment, we quantified how much nutritional value females were willing to trade for laying eggs on patches already occupied by larvae (social patches). Females were highly sensitive to nutritional quality, which was positively associated with their offspring success. Females, however, perceived social, low-nutrition patches (33% of the nutrients) as equally valuable as non-social, high-nutrition ones (100% of the nutrients). In follow-up experiments, we could not, however, either find informational benefits from copying others or detect what females' offspring may gain from developing with older larvae. Because patch-choice copying in fruit flies is a robust phenomenon in spite of potential costs due to competition, we suggest that it is beneficial in natural settings, where fruit flies encounter complex dynamics of microbial communities, which include, in addition to the preferred yeast species they feed on, numerous harmful fungi and bacteria. We suggest that microbial ecology underlies many cases of copying in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1992082031,"Worldwide, fishery managers strive to maintain fish stocks at or above levels that produce maximum sustainable yields, and to rebuild overexploited stocks that can no longer support such yields. In the United States, rebuilding overexploited stocks is a contentious issue, where most stocks are mandated to rebuild in as short a time as possible, and in a time period not to exceed 10 years. Opponents of such mandates and related guidance argue that rebuilding requirements are arbitrary, and create discontinuities in the time and fishing effort allowed for stocks to rebuild due to differences in productivity. Proponents, however, highlight how these mandates and guidance were needed to curtail the continued overexploitation of these stocks by setting firm deadlines on rebuilding. Here we evaluate the statements made by opponents and proponents of the 10-year rebuilding mandate and related guidance to determine whether such points are technically accurate using a simple population dynamics model and a database of U.S. fish stocks to parameterize the model. We also offer solutions to many of the issues surrounding this mandate and its implementation by recommending some fishing mortality based frameworks, which meet the intent of the 10-year rebuilding requirement while also providing more flexibility."
https://openalex.org/W2022671073,"Urethral stricture, a frequent source of lower urinary tract disorders in men, is still a difficult problem for urologists. Based the anti-restenosis effect of paclitaxel on coronary artery, the role of docetaxel, a semi-synthetic analogue of paclitaxel, in limiting urethral stricture formation was studied.Forty adult New Zealand male rabbits were involved in this study, which were randomly assigned into 3 groups, namely a high dose docetaxel (DH, 0.1 mg/d), a low dose docetaxel (DL, 0.01 mg/d) and a control (C) group, with 16, 16, 8 rabbits in each group, respectively. All animals underwent a 10 mm-long circumferential electrocoagulation of the bulbar urethra with a 13Fr pediatric resectoscope. Drugs were given by urethral irrigation daily and continuous for 28 days. Stricture formation was assessed by retrograde urethrography and videourethroscopy. Urethra pathology was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining and Sirius red staining.At the end of this study, 15, 14 and 7 rabbits remained for evaluation in DH, DL and C group, respectively. Urethral diameters in DH, DL and C group were (7.17±1.63) mm, (6.55±0.62) mm, (3.23±1.36) mm, with a normal urethral diameter of (9.08±1.29) mm. Lumen reduction in DH, DL and C group were (36.93±11.58)%, (48.03±7.89)% and (84.66±14.95)%, respectively. Statistically difference could be found between every two groups (p<0.05) both in urethral diameters and in lumen reduction, except for compare of urethral diameters between DH and DL group. Histological examination confirmed mass fibrous tissue and collagen content at the stricture sit in C group, whereas less in docetaxel treated rabbits.Docetaxel could limit urethral stricture formation, which may be due to inhibition of fibrous tissue and collagen expression. Docetaxel may become a new choice in the prevention of urethral stricture formation."
https://openalex.org/W2108011857,"The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the inner mitochondrial membrane is one of many fundamental processes governing the balance between health and disease. It is well known that ROS are necessary signaling molecules in gene expression, yet when expressed at high levels, ROS may cause oxidative stress and cell damage. Both hypoxia and hyperoxia may alter ROS production by changing mitochondrial Po2 (). Because depends on the balance between O2 transport and utilization, we formulated an integrative mathematical model of O2 transport and utilization in skeletal muscle to predict conditions to cause abnormally high ROS generation. Simulations using data from healthy subjects during maximal exercise at sea level reveal little mitochondrial ROS production. However, altitude triggers high mitochondrial ROS production in muscle regions with high metabolic capacity but limited O2 delivery. This altitude roughly coincides with the highest location of permanent human habitation. Above 25,000 ft., more than 90% of exercising muscle is predicted to produce abnormally high levels of ROS, corresponding to the “death zone” in mountaineering."
https://openalex.org/W2142053769,"Nimesulide is a COX-2 inhibitor used for symptomatic relief of rheumatoid arthritis. Leflunomide is an anti-pyrimidine used to manage the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. Herein we studied the influence of nimesulide and leflunomide combination in terms of disease symptoms and progression using collagen-induced arthritis model in mice, as a model for rheumatoid arthritis. Collagen induced arthritis was induced by immunization with type II collagen. Assessment of joint stiffness and articular hyperalgesia were evaluated using a locomotor activity cage and the Hargreaves method, respectively. Disease progression was assessed via arthritic index scoring, X-ray imaging, myeloperoxidase enzyme activity and histopathologic examination. Nimesulide induced only transient symptomatic alleviation on the top of decreased leucocytic infiltration compared to arthritis group. However, nimesulide alone failed to induce any significant improvement in the radiological or pathological disease progression. Leflunomide alone moderately alleviates the symptoms of arthritis and moderately retarded the radiological and pathological disease progression. Combination of nimesulide and leflunomide significantly improved symptomatic (analgesia and joint stiffness) and arthritic disease progression (radiological, pathological and Myeloperoxidase enzyme activity) in collagen induced arthritis animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2031048338,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the origin and function of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily as enzymes involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics. We used the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 as a model organism and sequence alignments to find bacterial AKRs with highest identity to human enzymes. Disappearance of NADPH was monitored spectrophotometrically to calculate enzymatic activity. The molecular weight of the native protein was determined by size exclusion chromatography. Substrate docking was performed by SwissDock. Sequence alignments identified the NADPH-dependent AKR3G1 having 41.5 and 40% identity with the human enzymes AKR1B1 and AKR1B10, respectively. Highest enzymatic efficiency was observed with 4-oxonon-2-enal (4-ONE; kcat/Km, 561 s-1 mM-1) and 4-hydroxynonenal (kcat/Km, 26.5 s-1 mM-1), respectively. P74308 is the most efficient enzyme for 4-ONE discovered until now. Cooperativity of this monomeric enzyme was observed with some substrates. Enzyme inactivation or oligomerization as possible explanations for nonhyperbolic enzyme kinetics were ruled out by Selwyn's test and gel filtration. The role of the little investigated carbonyl-reducing enzymes in detoxification seems to be in fact a very old process with rarely observed nonhyperbolic enzyme kinetics as an adaptation mechanism to higher concentrations of reactive oxygen species—Hintzpeter, J., Martin, H.-J., Maser, E.

https://openalex.org/W2058729475,"Platelet activating factor (PAF) has long been associated with acute edema and inflammatory responses. PAF acts by binding to a specific G-protein coupled receptor (PAF-R, Ptafr). However, the role of chronic PAF-R activation on sustained inflammatory responses has been largely ignored. We recently demonstrated that mice lacking the PAF-R (Ptafr-/- mice) exhibit increased cutaneous tumorigenesis in response to a two-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Ptafr-/- mice also exhibited increased chronic inflammation in response to phorbol ester application. In this present study, we demonstrate that topical application of the non-hydrolysable PAF mimetic (carbamoyl-PAF (CPAF)), exerts a potent, dose-dependent, and short-lived edema response in WT mice, but not Ptafr -/- mice or mice deficient in c-Kit (c-KitW-sh/W-sh mice). Using an ear inflammation model, co-administration of topical CPAF treatment resulted in a paradoxical decrease in both acute ear thickness changes associated with a single PMA application, as well as the sustained inflammation associated with chronic repetitive PMA applications. Moreover, mice treated topically with CPAF also exhibited a significant reduction in chemical carcinogenesis. The ability of CPAF to suppress acute and chronic inflammatory changes in response to PMA application(s) was PAF-R dependent, as CPAF had no effect on basal or PMA-induced inflammation in Ptafr-/- mice. Moreover, c-Kit appears to be necessary for the anti-inflammatory effects of CPAF, as CPAF had no observable effect in c-KitW-sh/W-sh mice. These data provide additional evidence that PAF-R activation exerts complex immunomodulatory effects in a model of chronic inflammation that is relevant to neoplastic development."
https://openalex.org/W1997438222,"Circulating lipid molecules reflect biological processes in the body and, thus, are useful tools for preclinical estimation of the efficacy and safety of newly developed drugs. However, background information on profiles of circulating lipid molecules in preclinical animal models is limited. Therefore, we examined the effects of multiple factors such as sex (fasted male vs. female), age (fasted 10 vs. 30 weeks old), and feeding conditions (feeding vs. fasting, 16 vs. 22 hr fasting, 10 AM vs. 4 PM blood collection), on the global profiles of lipid molecules in plasma from Sprague-Dawley rats by using a lipidomic approach. Our assay platform determined 262 lipid molecules (68 phospholipids, 20 sphingolipids, 138 neutral lipids, and 36 polyunsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites) in rat plasma. Multivariate discriminant analysis (orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis) and heat maps of statistically significant lipid molecules revealed that the plasma lipid profiles in rats are predominantly influenced by feeding conditions, followed by sex and age. In addition, the fasting duration (16 vs. 22 hr fasting) or the time of blood collection (10 AM vs. 4 PM blood collection) has limited or no contribution on the profiles of lipid molecules in rat plasma. Our results provide useful, fundamental information for exploring and validating biomarkers in future preclinical studies and may help to establish regulatory standards for such studies."
https://openalex.org/W2026066306,"The biological diversity among Stramenopiles is striking; they range from large multicellular seaweeds to tiny unicellular species, they embrace many ecologically important autothrophic (e.g., diatoms, brown algae), and heterotrophic (e.g., oomycetes) groups. Transcription factors (TFs) and other transcription regulators (TRs) regulate spatial and temporal gene expression. A plethora of transcriptional regulatory proteins have been identified and classified into families on the basis of sequence similarity. The purpose of this work is to identify the TF and TR complement in diverse species belonging to Stramenopiles in order to understand how these regulators may contribute to their observed diversity. We identified and classified 63 TF and TR families in 11 species of Stramenopiles. In some species we found gene families with high relative importance. Taking into account the 63 TF and TR families identified, 28 TF and TR families were established to be positively correlated with specific traits like number of predicted proteins, number of flagella and number of cell types during the life cycle. Additionally, we found gains and losses in TF and TR families specific to some species and clades, as well as, two families with high abundance specific to the autotrophic species and three families with high abundance specific to the heterotropic species. For the first time, there is a systematic search of TF and TR families in Stramenopiles. The attempts to uncover relationships between these families and the complexity of this group may be of great impact, considering that there are several important pathogens of plants and animals, as well as, important species involved in carbon cycling. Specific TF and TR families identified in this work appear to be correlated with particular traits in the Stramenopiles group and may be correlated with the high complexity and diversity in Stramenopiles."
https://openalex.org/W1995958191,"High-quality mapping of genomic regions and genes between two organisms is an indispensable prerequisite for evolutionary analyses and comparative genomics. Existing approaches to this problem focus on either delineating orthologs or finding extended sequence regions of common evolutionary origin (syntenic blocks). We propose SyntenyMapper, a novel tool for refining predefined syntenic regions. SyntenyMapper creates a set of blocks with conserved gene order between two genomes and finds all minor rearrangements that occurred since the evolutionary split of the two species considered. We also present TrackMapper, a SyntenyMapper-based tool that allows users to directly compare genome features, such as histone modifications, between two organisms, and identify genes with highly conserved features. We demonstrate SyntenyMapper's advantages by conducting a large-scale analysis of micro-rearrangements within syntenic regions of 25 eukaryotic species. Unsurprisingly, the number and length of syntenic regions is correlated with evolutionary distance, while the number of micro-rearrangements depends only on the size of the harboring region. On the other hand, the size of rearranged regions remains relatively constant regardless of the evolutionary distance between the organisms, implying a length constraint in the rearrangement process. SyntenyMapper is a useful software tool for both large-scale and gene-centric genome comparisons."
https://openalex.org/W2024417188,"Anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex (dACC/mFC) response to negative feedback represents the actions of a generalized error-monitoring system critical for the management of goal-directed behavior. Magnitude of dACC/mFC response to negative feedback correlates with levels of post-feedback behavioral change, and with proficiency of operant learning processes. With this in mind, it follows that an ability to alter dACC/mFC response to negative feedback may lead to representative changes in operant learning proficiency. To this end, the present study investigated the extent to which healthy individuals would show modulation of their dACC/mFC response when instructed to try to either maximize or minimize their neural response to the presentation of contingent negative feedback. Participants performed multiple runs of a standard time-estimation task, during which they received feedback regarding their ability to accurately estimate a one-second duration. On Watch runs, participants were simply instructed to try to estimate as closely as possible the one second duration. On Increase and Decrease runs, participants performed the same task, but were instructed to ""try to increase [decrease] their brain's response every time they received negative feedback"". Results indicated that participants showed changes in dACC/mFC response under these differing instructional conditions: dACC/mFC activity following negative feedback was higher in the Increase condition, and dACC activity trended lower in the Decrease condition, compared to the Watch condition. Moreover, dACC activity correlated with post-feedback performance adjustments, and these adjustments were highest in the Increase condition. Potential implications for neuromodulation and facilitated learning are discussed."
