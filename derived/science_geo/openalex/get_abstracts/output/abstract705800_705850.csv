https://openalex.org/W4311218943,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection and death in young infants and the elderly. With no effective prophylactic treatment available, current vaccine candidates aim to elicit neutralizing antibodies. However, binding and neutralization have poorly predicted protection in the past, and accumulating data across epidemiologic cohorts and animal models collectively point to a role for additional antibody Fc-effector functions. To begin to define the humoral correlates of immunity against RSV, here we profiled an adenovirus 26 RSV-preF vaccine-induced humoral immune response in a group of healthy adults that were ultimately challenged with RSV. Protection from infection was linked to opsonophagocytic functions, driven by IgA and differentially glycosylated RSV-specific IgG profiles, marking a functional humoral immune signature of protection against RSV. Furthermore, Fc-modified monoclonal antibodies able to selectively recruit effector functions demonstrated significant antiviral control in a murine model of RSV."

https://openalex.org/W4311439692,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been repeatedly associated with poor mental health. Previous studies have mostly focused on short time frames such as around the first lockdown periods, and the majority of research is based on self-report questionnaires. Less is known about the fluctuations of psychological states over longer time frames across the pandemic. Twitter timelines of 4,735 users from London and New York were investigated to shed light on potential fluctuations of several psychological states and constructs related to the pandemic. Moving averages are presented for the years 2020 and 2019. Further, mixed negative binomial regression models were fitted to estimate monthly word counts for the time before and during the pandemic. Several psychological states and constructs fluctuated heavily on Twitter during 2020 but not during 2019. Substantial increases in levels of sadness, anxiety, anger, and concerns about home and health were observed around the first lockdown periods in both cities. The levels of most constructs decreased after the initial spike, but negative emotions such as sadness, anxiety, and anger remained elevated throughout 2020 compared to the year prior to the pandemic. Tweets from both cities showed remarkably similar temporal patterns, and there are similarities to reactions found on Twitter following other previous traumatic events."
https://openalex.org/W4311458224,"Agroinfiltration is a method used in biopharming to support plant-based biosynthesis of therapeutic proteins such as antibodies and viral antigens involved in vaccines. Major advantages of generating proteins in plants is the low cost, massive scalability and the rapid yield of the technology. Herein, we report the agroinfiltration-based production of glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein. We show that it exhibits high-affinity binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and displays folding similar to antigen produced in mammalian expression systems. Moreover, our plant-expressed RBD was readily detected by IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies from the serum of SARS-CoV-2 infected and vaccinated individuals. We further demonstrate that binding of plant-expressed RBD to ACE2 is efficiently neutralized by these antibodies. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that recombinant RBD produced via agroinfiltration exhibits suitable biochemical and antigenic features for use in serological and neutralization assays, and in subunit vaccine platforms."
https://openalex.org/W4311263342,"Professionals in the healthcare sector are a particularly vulnerable group for occupational strain due to high work-related psychological stress. For the implementation of targeted stress-prevention interventions as an important part of a workplace health management programme for all occupational groups and hierarchy levels, information about the current state of their mental health is mandatory. Hence, this study investigated the association of general well-being and different leadership styles among employees in a German tertiary hospital.Via an online survey, 10,101 employees were contacted. The final sample consisted of 1137 employees. Of these, 27.7% described themselves as leaders and 72.3% as followers. Most participants were female (74.8%), more than half were under 41 years old. Besides control variables, general well-being (WHO-5) and leadership style (transactional and transformational, laissez-faire and destructive leadership) were assessed.Leaders reported higher well-being scores than followers. Physicians without leadership responsibilities had the lowest scores for well-being. Practitioners of both transformational and transactional leadership were associated with higher well-being scores, while those practicing laissez-faire and destructive leadership had lower scores for almost every professional group.Results highlight the necessity for future multimodal health-preventive leadership interventions feature behavioural and organizational intervention modules specifically tailored to hospital professionals at different hierarchical and functional levels to foster the mental health of employees."

https://openalex.org/W4311327236,"The rapid growth of China's economy has greatly accelerated the process of urbanization during China's reform periods. Urbanization has significantly caused land use and land cover (LULC) changes and thus has impacts on the local climate and ecosystem. This study chooses Quanzhou, a fast-developing city of southeast China, as an example to detect and quantify the LULC and ecological changes from 1989 to 2018 by using the remotely sensed technique. The LULC of Quanzhou was derived from the four Landsat images taken in 1989, 1999, 2007 and 2018, and the land-use-degree ratio index and land-use-change method were used to estimate the change of land use. The remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) was used to detect the ecological changes of the city. The built-up land expansion intensity and annual built-up land expansion rate were carried out for seven districts of Quanzhou. The results show that the urban area of Quanzhou has drastically grown by 192.99 km2 at the expense of forest, water, and cropland land during the 1989~2018 period. Moreover, the built-up land of seven districts had expanded at the average rate of 0.027~0.154 per year and the built-up expansion intensity was higher than 0.59. The average RSEI value of Quanzhou city dropped from 0.78 in 1989 to 0.34 in 2018, which suggested an overall decline in ecological quality. The proportion of areas with an RSEI rating good decreased from 30.84% to 11.52% while the proportion of areas with rating bad increased from 4.73% to 19.11% during the past 29 years. This study has shown the built-up land expansion intensity is negatively correlated with the ecological quality change, and the increase in built-up land can greatly accelerate the decline of the ecological quality. Government policies play a profound impact on land use changes, urbanization and eco-environment changes. Therefore, the policy decision-makers should take enough action and consider integrating the concept of ecology to enable the healthy and sustainable development of the city."
https://openalex.org/W4311439262,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of corticospinal tract motor neurons. Previous studies showed that adenosine-mediated neuromodulation is disturbed in ALS and that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a neuroprotective function in ALS mouse models. We evaluated how adenosine (A1R and A2AR) and VEGF (VEGFA, VEGFB, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) system markers are altered in the cortex and spinal cord of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic SOD1G93A mice. We then assessed if/how chronic treatment of SOD1G93A mice with a widely consumed adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine, modulates VEGF system and/or the levels of Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), known to be under control of A2AR. We found out decreases in A1R and increases in A2AR levels even before disease onset. Concerning the VEGF system, we detected increases of VEGFB and VEGFR-2 levels in the spinal cord at pre-symptomatic stage, which reverses at the symptomatic stage, and decreases of VEGFA levels in the cortex, in very late disease states. Chronic treatment with caffeine rescued cortical A1R levels in SOD1G93A mice, bringing them to control levels, while rendering VEGF signaling nearly unaffected. In contrast, BDNF levels were significantly affected in SOD1G93A mice treated with caffeine, being decreased in the cortex and increased in spinal the cord. Altogether, these findings suggest an early dysfunction of the adenosinergic system in ALS and highlights the possibility that the negative influence of caffeine previously reported in ALS animal models results from interference with BDNF rather than with the VEGF signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W4311486273,"In response to the problems of low fertilizer application efficiency, poor operation quality, and uneven application of fertilizer by domestic tea garden trenching and fertilizing machines, an automatic depth-adjusting double screw trenching and fertilizing machine was designed. The machine uses a double spiral furrowing and fertilizer application method, which can complete the integrated operation of furrowing, fertilizer application, and mulching at one time. The key components of the machine such as the screw-type fertilizer discharger, trenching, and fertilizer application mechanism are designed using theoretical analysis, and the trenching depth is automatically adjusted through the hydraulic control system to maintain a consistent depth. A single-factor test and a quadratic regression rotary orthogonal test were conducted to select the diameter of the spiral fertilizer discharger, the rotational speed of the spiral fertilizer discharger, and the rotational speed of the trenching and fertilizer application mechanisms. Based on these tests, the fertilizer application performance of the fertilizer machine was evaluated, and a mathematical model of the fertilizer application volume and coefficient of variation was established. The influence of the test factors on the coefficient of variation was also analyzed. In the study, 58.36 and 480.35 r/min were found to be the optimal rotational speeds for spiral fertilizer discharge and trenching and fertilizer application, respectively, while 88.90 mm was found to be the optimal diameter for spiral fertilizer discharge. The coefficient of variation for the spiral fertilizer discharge was 3.95%, which meets the tea plantation's fertilizer application requirements."
https://openalex.org/W4311263346,"The fungus Candida glabrata and the bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis are important biofilm-forming microorganisms responsible of nosocomial infections in patients. In addition to causing single-species disease, these microorganisms are also involved in polymicrobial infections leading to an increased antimicrobial resistance. To expand knowledge about polymicrobial biofilms, in this study we investigate the formation of single- and dual-species biofilms of these two opportunistic pathogens employing several complementary approaches. First, biofilm biomass, biofilm metabolic activity and the microbial composition in single- and dual-species biofilms were assessed and compared. Then, the expression of three genes of C. glabrata and three genes of S. epidermidis positively related to the process of biofilm formation was evaluated. Although S. epidermidis is a stronger biofilm producer than C. glabrata, both biological and genetic data indicate that S. epidermidis growth is inhibited by C. glabrata which dominates the dual-species biofilms. To better understand the mechanisms of the interactions between the two microorganisms, a broad GC-MS metabolomic dataset of extracellular metabolites for planktonic, single- and dual-species biofilm cultures of C. glabrata and S. epidermidis was collected. As demonstrated by Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) of GC-MS metabolomic data, planktonic cultures, single- and dual-species biofilms can be sharply differentiated from each other by the nature and levels of an assortment of primary and secondary metabolites secreted in the culture medium. However, according to our data, 2-phenylethanol (secreted by C. glabrata) and the synergistically combined antifungal activity of 3-phenyllactic acid and of the cyclic dipeptide cyclo-(l-Pro-l-Trp) (secreted by S. epidermidis) play a major role in the race of the two microorganisms for predominance and survival."
https://openalex.org/W4311327003,"Introduction Seasonal influenza is a significant public health challenge worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiological characteristics and spatial patterns of severe hospitalized influenza cases confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in Iran. Methods Data were obtained from Iran’s Ministry of Health and Medical Education and included all hospitalized lab-confirmed influenza cases from January 1, 2016, to December 30, 2018 (n = 9146). The Getis-Ord Gi* and Local Moran’s I statistics were used to explore the hotspot areas and spatial cluster/outlier patterns of influenza. We also built a multivariable logistic regression model to identify covariates associated with patients’ mortality. Results Cumulative incidence and mortality rate were estimated at 11.44 and 0.49 (per 100,000), respectively, and case fatality rate was estimated at 4.35%. The patients’ median age was 40 (interquartile range: 22–63), and 55.5% (n = 5073) were female. The hotspot and cluster analyses revealed high-risk areas in northern parts of Iran, especially in cold, humid, and densely populated areas. Moreover, influenza hotspots were more common during the colder months of the year, especially in high-elevated regions. Mortality was significantly associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01–1.02), infection with virus type-A (aOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.27–2.15), male sex (aOR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.44–2.18), cardiovascular disease (aOR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.33–2.20), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aOR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.40–2.34), malignancy (aOR: 4.77, 95% CI: 2.87–7.62), and grade-II obesity (aOR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.09–3.74). Conclusions We characterized the spatial and epidemiological heterogeneities of severe hospitalized influenza cases confirmed by PCR in Iran. Detecting influenza hotspot clusters could inform prioritization and geographic specificity of influenza prevention, testing, and mitigation resource management, including vaccination planning in Iran."
https://openalex.org/W4311439493,"Introduction This study explores how tutors and tutees perceived their teaching and learning experience in a near-peer teaching programme within a formal undergraduate medical-education curriculum. Methods This mixed-methods study was conducted in an Asian medical school. First, a survey was administered to two groups of students, one that had been tutored by near-peers, and another with faculty tutors. Then, the near-peer tutors were interviewed and wrote reflection essays that the researchers collected. Quantitative analysis was used to analyse the survey responses, and qualitative analysis to analyse the interview and reflection data. Results Our study found no difference between near-peer tutees’ and faculty tutees’ perceptions of either tutor facilitation or tutor behaviours. Also, when near-peer tutors explained how their experience of delivering tutoring had influenced their professional-identity formation, they highlighted that they had gained skills important to their future careers as medical educators. Conclusion Integrating near-peer teaching into undergraduate medical curricula could be beneficial to both tutors and tutees because of the social, cognitive, and professional congruence between these two groups, and due to its likely positive influence on their professional-identity formation."
https://openalex.org/W4311258061,"Air-conducted ultrasound (> 17.8 kHz; US) is produced by an increasing number of technical devices in our daily environment. While several studies indicate that exposure to US in public spaces can lead to subjective symptoms such as 'annoyance' or 'difficulties in concentration', the effects of US on brain activity are poorly understood. In the present study, individual hearing thresholds (HT) for sounds in the US frequency spectrum were assessed in 21 normal-hearing participants. The effects of US were then investigated by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 15 of these participants underwent three resting-state acquisitions, two with a 21.5 kHz tone presented monaurally at 5 dB above (ATC) and 10 dB below (BTC) the HT and one without auditory stimulation (NTC), as well as three runs of an n-back working memory task involving similar stimulus conditions (n-ATC, n-BTC, n-NTC). Comparing data gathered during n-NTC vs. fixation, we found that task performance was associated with the recruitment of regions within the cognitive control network, including prefrontal and parietal areas as well as the cerebellum. Direct contrasts of the two stimulus conditions (n-ATC & n-BTC) vs. n-NTC showed no significant differences in brain activity, irrespective of whether a whole-brain or a region of interest approach with primary auditory cortex as the seed was used. Likewise, no differences were found when the resting-state runs were compared. However, contrast analysis (n-BTC vs. n-ATC) revealed a strong activation in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, triangular part) only when US was presented below the HT (p < 0.001, cluster > 30). In addition, IFG activation was also associated with faster reaction times during n-BTC (p = 0.033) as well as with verbal reports obtained after resting-state, i.e., the more unpleasant sound was perceived during BTC vs. ATC, the higher activation in bilateral IFG was and vice versa (p = 0.003). While this study provides no evidence for activation of primary auditory cortex in response to audible US (even though participants heard the sounds), it indicates that US can lead to changes in the cognitive control network and affect cognitive performance only when presented below the HT. Activation of bilateral IFG could reflect an increase in cognitive demand when focusing on task performance in the presence of slightly unpleasant and/or distracting US that may not be fully controllable by attentional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W4311306067,"Current clinical therapies targeting receptor tyrosine kinases including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) have had limited or no effect on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Unlike esophageal adenocarcinomas, ESCC acquire glucose in excess of their anabolic need. We recently reported that glucose-induced growth factor-independent proliferation requires the phosphorylation of FAKHis58. Here, we confirm His58 phosphorylation in FAK immunoprecipitates of glucose-stimulated, serum-starved ESCC cells using antibodies specific for 3-phosphohistidine and mass spectrometry. We also confirm a role for the histidine kinase, NME1, in glucose-induced FAKpoHis58 and ESCC cell proliferation, correlating with increased levels of NME1 in ESCC tumors versus normal esophageal tissues. Unbiased screening identified glucose-induced retinoblastoma transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) binding to FAK, mediated through a ""LxCxE"" RB1-binding motif in FAK's FERM domain. Importantly, in the absence of growth factors, glucose increased FAK scaffolding of RB1 in the cytoplasm, correlating with increased ESCC G1→S phase transition. Our data strongly suggest that this glucose-mediated mitogenic pathway is novel and represents a unique targetable opportunity in ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W4311326792,"The list-level proportion congruency effect (PCE) and the context-specific PC (CSPC) effect are typical findings in experimental conflict protocols, which competing explanations attribute to different mechanisms. Of these mechanisms, stimulus-unspecific conflict-induced selectivity adjustments have attracted the most interest, from various disciplines. Recent methodological advances have yielded an experimental procedure for entirely ruling out all stimulus-specific alternatives. However, there is a stimulus-unspecific alternative-temporal learning-which cannot even be ruled out as the sole cause of either effect with any established experimental procedure. That is because it is very difficult to create a scenario in which selectivity adjustments and temporal learning make different predictions-with traditional approaches, it is arguably impossible. Here, we take a step towards solving this problem, and experimentally dissociating the two mechanisms. First, we present our novel approach which is a combination of abstract experimental conditions and theoretical assumptions. As we illustrate with two computational models, given this particular combination, the two mechanisms predict opposite modulations of an as yet unexplored hybrid form of the list-level PCE and the CSPC effect, which we term context-dependent PCE (CDPCE). With experimental designs that implement the abstract conditions properly, it is therefore possible to rule out temporal learning as the sole cause of stimulus-unspecific adaptations to PC, and to unequivocally attribute the latter, at least partially, to selectivity adjustments. Secondly, we evaluate methodological and theoretical aspects of the presented approach. Finally, we report two experiments, that illustrate both the promise of and a potential challenge to this approach."
https://openalex.org/W4311326796,"Countries around the world have become concerned about their responsibility to protect the environment and resources. In this paper, we established a model of multi-period PSW-DID (weighted propensity score matching- differences-in-differences) to test the effect of China’s audit of natural resource. We found that: (1) local governments had a strategic incentive to reduce pollution, they paid more attention to environmental performance linked to individual promotion than to green innovation and development. (2) Compared with the long-term and complexity of water pollution control, they paid more attention to air pollution treatment. (3) In the long run, the environmental audit was indeed beneficial to the improvement of environmental quality, but the time of taking effect was the second year (one-year lag). (4) In addition, because of the contradiction between the neglect of human capital and the timeliness of environmental supervision, the local government did not show substantial pollution reduction. Therefore, local officials should foster the long-term responsibility consciousness of green innovation and pay more attention to the integration of human capital. The audit of natural resources should establish a long-term mechanism, which could establish a complete accountability system or change off-office audit to interim audit. The construction of audit big data platforms should pay more attention to substantive characteristic data, such as data on population inflow, which is not only a paper score of air pollution. This study can reveal the dilemma of pollution prevention and control in China, urge local governments to promote the rational flow of human resources, improve the innovation level, and achieve substantive pollution control and efficiency enhancement of green development."
https://openalex.org/W4311326827,"This study examined the association of smoking with ovarian reserve in a cross-sectional study of 207 women enrolled in the Louisville Tobacco Smoke Exposure, Genetic Susceptibility, and Infertility (LOUSSI) Study and assessed effect modification by NAT2 acetylator phenotype.Information on current smoking status was collected using a structured questionnaire and confirmed by cotinine assay. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels were used to assess ovarian reserve. Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) was defined as AMH <1ng/mL. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the NAT2 gene, which metabolizes toxins found in cigarette smoke, were analyzed to determine NAT2 acetylator status. Linear and logistic regression were used to determine the effects of smoking on ovarian reserve and evaluate effect modification by NAT2. Regression analyses were stratified by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) status and adjusted for age.Current smoking status, either passive or active as measured by urinary cotinine assay, was not significantly associated with DOR. For dose-response assessed using self-report, the odds of DOR increased significantly for every additional cigarette currently smoked (Odds ratio, OR:1.08; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI:1.01-1.15); additionally, every 1 pack-year increase in lifetime exposure was associated with an increased odds of DOR among women without PCOS (OR: 1.08 95%CI: 0.99-1.18). These trends appear to be driven by the heavy or long-term smokers. Effect modification by NAT2 genotype was not established.A history of heavy smoking may indicate increased risk of diminished ovarian reserve."

The observational period from the matched early program cohort starts from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2017 and includes 7181 DMP participants and 21543 non-participants. In the established matched program cohort, 3087 DMP participants and 9261 non-participants were observed within January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017.In the early program cohort, 22.1% of the patients in the DMP-group and 29.7% in the control-group died after 8 years follow-up (HR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.66-0.73). A difference of € 1070 (95% bootstrap-T interval: € 723 - € 1412) in mean total costs per year was observed. In the established program cohort, 10.4% DMP participants died 4 years after enrollment, whereas in the control-group 11.9% of the patients died (HR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.78-0.99). Healthcare utilization is higher in the DMP-group (75%-96%) compared to the control-group (63%-90%).The 8-year long-term follow up of the DMP program showed a relevant improvement of survival and healthcare costs of patients with type 2 diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W4311439358,"Chronic diseases constitute a major public health problem in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Chronic diseases have been found to be associated with an increased prevalence of depression and depressive symptoms. Depression can have detrimental effect on the prognosis of the disease and quality of life in patients.This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and correlates of depression in a sample of patients suffering from chronic disease in Al-Ain city, UAE.A cross-sectional survey based study was conducted with 417 participants recruited from seven primary health care centers of Al-Ain city. Men and women aged 18 years and above suffering from chronic disease filled the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were performed on the collected data to investigate correlates of different factors with depression. Data was analyzed using SPSS (version 26). The study was approved by Ambulatory Healthcare Services (AHS) Human Ethics Research Committee.The majority 62.41% (n = 254) of the sample were females, 57.97% (n = 240) aged above 55 years and with a median (Q25, Q75) duration of chronic disease of 8 (4, 15) years. The prevalence of depression was 21.1% (95% CI: 17.5%-25.3%). With severe depression was in 1.7% and mild-moderate in 34.7% of the participants. Depression severity was statistically significantly associated with increasing age (p = 0.006), low level of education (p<0.001), presence of asthma (p = 0.007) and heart disease (p = 0.013). Unadjusted logistic regression reported that presence of depression was significantly associated with female gender (cOR = 1.8, [95% CI; 1.1-3.1], p = 0.025), and presence of chronic kidney disease (cOR = 4.9, [95% CI; 1.3-20.2], p = 0.020) and heart disease (cOR = 2.9, [95% CI; 1.6-5.4], p = 0.001) longer duration of disease in years (cOR = 1.04, [95% CI; 1.01-1.07], p = 0.003). However, in the adjusted logistic regression analysis, participants with heart disease (aOR = 2.8, [95% CI; 1.4-5.5], p = 0.004), and with longer duration of disease (aOR = 1.04, [1.01-1.07], p = 0.014) remained significantly associated statistically with higher chance of having depression.The prevalence of depression was quite high and the study highlights for health care professionals and policy makers, the importance of mental health support as part of a comprehensive management plan for patients with chronic diseases. A multidisciplinary comprehensive program will improve the long-term outcomes of these patients. Patients with chronic diseases may need more support and counseling at primary health care levels."
https://openalex.org/W4311439362,"Objectives People with bipolar disorder (BD) spend more time depressed than manic/hypomanic, and depression is associated with greater impairments in psychosocial functioning and quality of life than mania/hypomania. Emerging evidence suggests psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in “magic mushrooms,” is a promising treatment for unipolar depression. Clinical trials of psilocybin therapy have excluded people with BD as a precaution against possible adverse effects (e.g., mania). Our study centered the experiences of adults living with BD who consumed psilocybin-containing mushrooms, and aimed to (1) understand its subjective impacts on BD symptoms, (2) deepen understanding of Phase I survey results, and (3) elucidate specific contextual factors associated with adverse reactions in naturalistic settings. Methods Following an international survey (Phase I), follow-up interviews were conducted with 15 respondents (Phase II) to further understand psilocybin use among adults with BD. As part of a larger mixed-methods explanatory sequential design study, reflexive thematic analysis was used to elaborate findings. Results Three major themes containing sub-themes were developed. (1) Mental Health Improvements: (1.1) decreased impact and severity of depression, (1.2) increased emotion processing, (1.3) development of new perspectives, and (1.4) greater relaxation and sleep. (2) Undesired Mental Health Impacts: (2.1) changes in sleep, (2.2) increased mania severity, (2.3) hospitalization, and (2.4) distressing sensory experiences. (3) Salient Contextual Factors for psilocybin use included: (3.1) poly-substance use and psilocybin dose, (3.2) solo versus social experiences, and (3.3) pre-psilocybin sleep deprivation. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate both benefits and risks of psilocybin use in this population. Carefully designed clinical trials focused on safety and preliminary efficacy are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4311439461,"Background Excessive self-disclosure online may risk the reputations, mental health problems, and professional lives of nursing students. This study investigated nursing students’ usage of social media, their attitudes towards social media, mental health problems and self-disclosures, and the relationships of these variables. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted online (n = 1054) with questionnaires of Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), Social Media Fatigue (SMF), Students’ Uses and Views of Social Media (SUVSM) and self-disclosure in social media which included self-information shown on social media and information viewed by others. Results Although most of them held positive attitudes towards social media, 17.4% of the participants acknowledged that they had posted inappropriate contents online and 37.6% witnessed improper posts from schoolmates or teachers online. SMF was affected by familiar with relevant regulations on the social media usage ( β = -.10, p &lt; .001), FoMO ( β = .41, p &lt; .001), and SUVSM ( β = .17, p &lt; .001). Additionally, nearly 1/3 participants reported their net-friends could view following information: gender, age, occupation, education level and location. Self- disclosure in social media was positively influenced by education ( β = .10, p &lt; .001), sharing moments or Weibo, etc. ( β = .009, P = 0.009), time spent on social media daily ( β = .11, p &lt; .001), accepting stranger’s “friend request” ( β = .06, P = 0.047), FoMO ( β = .14, p &lt; .001) and SMF ( β = .19, p &lt; .001). Furthermore, effect of SUVSM on self-disclosure in social media was mediated by FoMO and SMF. Conclusion Inappropriate contents are posted and witnessed by appreciable proportions of nursing students. Positive attitude towards social media may strengthen FoMO and SMF, which may increase self-disclosure in social media in turn."
https://openalex.org/W4311439503,"Routine use of chlorhexidine or octenidine for antiseptic bathing may have unintended consequences. Our analysis aimed to assess the phenotypic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from clinical samples to chlorhexidine and octenidine collected from intensive care units (ICU) that routinely used 2% chlorhexidine-impregnated wash cloths or 0.08% octenidine wash mitts (intervention) or water and soap (control) for daily patient care.This study was conducted within the context of a three armed cluster-randomised controlled decolonisation trial (Registration number DRKS00010475, registration date August 18, 2016). Bacterial isolates were collected prior to and at the end of a 12-month-intervention period from patients with ≥ 3 days length of stay at an ICU assigned to one of two intervention groups or the control group. Phenotypic susceptibility to chlorhexidine and octenidine was assessed by an accredited contract research laboratory determining minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) as percentage of extraction solutions used. MIC were reported as estimated concentrations in μg/ml derived from the chlorhexidine and octenidine extraction solutions. Statistical analyses including generalized estimating equation models were applied.In total, 790 ICU-attributable bacterial isolates from clinical samples (e.g. blood, urine, tracheal aspirate) were eligible for all analyses. Pathogens included were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 155), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS, n = 122), Escherichia coli (n = 227), Klebsiella spp. (n = 150) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 136). For all species, chlorhexidine and octenidine MIC did not increase from baseline to intervention period in the antiseptic bathing groups. For proportions of bacterial isolates with elevated chlorhexidine / octenidine MIC (≥ species-specific chlorhexidine / octenidine MIC50), adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) showed no differences between the intervention groups and the control group (intervention period).We found no evidence for reduced phenotypic susceptibilities of bacterial isolates from clinical samples to chlorhexidine or octenidine in ICUs 12 months after implementation of routine antiseptic bathing with the respective substances."
https://openalex.org/W4311441604,"Asthma is a prevalent chronic respiratory condition and remains a common cause for hospitalization. However, contemporary data on asthma hospitalization rates, comorbidity burden, and in-hospital outcomes are lacking.Survey-weighted analysis of hospitalization records with a primary diagnosis of asthma using data from the US National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample between 2004 and 2017. Outcomes were number of hospitalizations per 100,000 population and in-hospital outcomes including receipt of ventilation, length of stay, and hospital costs. Patient and admission characteristics and comorbidity burden were examined over time. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were fitted for over-time risks of the outcomes.Among 3,098,863 asthma admissions between 2004 and 2017, mean (±SD) age was 29 (±25), 57% females, 36% White, 40% had Medicaid as primary payer. During 2004-2017, asthma hospitalizations declined from 89 to 56 per 100,000 population; length of stay remained overall stable; median (interquartile range IQR) inflation-adjusted hospital costs doubled from $8,446 (9,227) in 2004 to $17,756 (19,434) in 2017. Common comorbidities in patients admitted with asthma were hypertension and diabetes in adults, but gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, anemia, and obesity in children. Over time, the prevalence of mental illness increased by >50%. Severe asthma (IRR, 2.48; 95%CI: 2.27-2.72) and psychoses (IRR, 1.10; 1.05-1.14) were predictors of prolonged hospitalization. Asian/Pacific Islanders were more likely to receive ventilation (OR: 2.35; 1.73-3.20) than White patients. Hospital costs were significantly higher in females and adults with hypertension (coefficient, 1405.2; 283.1-2527.4) or psychoses (coefficient, 1978.4; 674.9-3282.0).US asthma hospitalization rates fluctuated in earlier years but declined over time, which may reflect improvements in community care and declining asthma prevalence. Comorbidity burden, including mental illness, increased over time and is associated with in-hospital outcomes. This highlights the changing landscape of asthma admissions which may inform redesigning services to support pre-hospitalization asthma care and help further reduce admissions, particularly among patients with multimorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W4311458214,"The paradigm shifts of conventional office spaces for virtual workspaces which practiced Work from Home (WFH) due to Covid-19, created a serious change in the lifestyles of employees, due to the overlap of 'work' and 'life' domains in one's life. Since software engineers have a possibility of permanently adapting into WFH, the objective of this study is to unveil factors which would have a significant impact on the work-life balance of software engineers in Sri Lanka, while WFH. Only a very limited researches have shed light on this context, thereby this study would contribute to fill the empirical gap. The study undertook a quantitative approach by collecting primary data through a questionnaire from 384 participants, based on simple random sampling, and analyzing collected data based on Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), using Smart PLS 3.3.9 software. Study results revealed that 'supervisor's trust and support' and the 'individual workspace,' have a significant impact on work-life balance, while 'working conditions,' 'possibility to access the organization's networks' and 'number of children' have no such significant impact. Thereby the study infers that, sound support and trust extended by supervisors and a designated distraction-free workspace; as measures to demarcate the boundary of work and life. Distinctive findings of this study would primarily be fruitful for software engineers to dive into a balanced state of work and life not only during Covid-19 but in future too. Study findings will also contribute to software industry personnel and policymakers in Sri Lanka as well as other developing countries, to establish effective strategies in favor of software engineers who WFH. Further, considering IT industry's significant contribution towards Sri Lanka's economic growth amidst Covid-19, results of this study would be high-yielding to indirectly succor IT-services-supported economic growth amidst the pandemic-driven hardships in Sri Lanka."
https://openalex.org/W4311458222,"Smell and taste alteration are closely linked to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and may be associated with a more indolent disease course. Serologic response rates among individuals with mild disease remains limited. We sought to identify whether chemosensory changes associated with COVID-19 were predictive of a serologic response.Cross-sectional study.The sample consisted of 306 adults (≥18 years old) volunteering for convalescent plasma donation following perceived COVID-19 illness from April-June 2020. Documentation of COVID-19 PCR status, clinical symptoms at time of illness, and treatment course occurred at the time of serologic analysis, where we assessed chemosensory function using patient-perceived deficits. We implemented previously validated ELISA screening to determine serologic status regarding anti-Spike immunoglobulins. Statistical analysis using stepwise logistic models were employed to identify predictive factors of serologic response.Of 306 patients undergoing serologic and chemosensory evaluation, 196 (64.1%) and 195 (63.7%) reported subjective olfactory and taste dysfunction, respectively, during the first two weeks of COVID-19 infection. In unadjusted models, the odds of developing suprathreshold IgG antibody titers were 1.98 times higher among those who reported altered smell (95% CI 1.14-3.42, p = 0.014) and 2.02 times higher among those with altered taste (95% CI 1.17-3.48, p = 0.011) compared to those with normal smell and taste. Multivariable logistic models adjusting for sex, age, race/ethnicity, symptom duration, smoking status and comorbidities index demonstrated that altered smell and taste remained significant predictors of positive anti-spike IgG response (smell OR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.05-3.44, p = 0.033; taste OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.12-3.61, p = 0.019).Subjective chemosensory dysfunction, as self-reported smell or taste deficiency, is highly predictive of serologic response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This information may be useful for patient counseling. Additional longitudinal research should be performed to better understand the onset and duration of the serologic response in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W4311458314,"By September 2021 an estimated 32% of the global population was fully vaccinated for COVID-19 but the global distribution of vaccines was extremely unequal, with 72% or more vaccinated in the ten countries with the highest vaccination rates and less than 2% in the ten countries with the lowest vaccination rates. Given that governments need to secure public support for investments in global vaccine sharing, it is important to understand the levels and drivers of public support for international vaccine solidarity. Using a factorial experiment administered to more than 10,000 online survey respondents in Germany in 2021, we demonstrate that the majority of German citizens are against global inequalities in vaccine distribution. Respondents are supportive of substantive funding amounts, on the order of the most generous contributions provided to date, though still below amounts that are likely needed for a successful global campaign. Public preferences appear largely to be driven by intrinsic concern for the welfare of global populations though are in part explained by material considerations-particularly risks of continued health threats from a failure to vaccinate globally. Strategic considerations are of more limited importance in shaping public opinion; in particular we see no evidence for free riding on contributions by other states. Finally, drawing on an additional survey experiment, we show that there is scope to use information campaigns highlighting international health externalities to augment public support for global campaigns."
https://openalex.org/W4311472318,"Quantitative grading and classification of the severity of facial paralysis (FP) are important for selecting the treatment plan and detecting subtle improvement that cannot be detected clinically. To date, none of the available FP grading systems have gained widespread clinical acceptance. The work presented here describes the development and testing of a system for FP grading and assessment which is part of a comprehensive evaluation system for FP. The system is based on the Kinect v2 hardware and the accompanying software SDK 2.0 in extracting the real time facial landmarks and facial animation units (FAUs). The aim of this paper is to describe the development and testing of the FP assessment phase (first phase) of a larger comprehensive evaluation system of FP. The system includes two phases; FP assessment and FP classification. A dataset of 375 records from 13 unilateral FP patients was compiled for this study. The FP assessment includes three separate modules. One module is the symmetry assessment of both facial sides at rest and while performing five voluntary facial movements. Another module is responsible for recognizing the facial movements. The last module assesses the performance of each facial movement for both sides of the face depending on the involved FAUs. The study validates that the FAUs captured using the Kinect sensor can be processed and used to develop an effective tool for the automatic evaluation of FP. The developed FP grading system provides a detailed quantitative report and has significant advantages over the existing grading scales. It is fast, easy to use, user-independent, low cost, quantitative, and automated and hence it is suitable to be used as a clinical tool."

In harsh conditions in which marine renewable energy is harvested, integrated monitoring platforms comprising multibeam imaging sonar systems coupled with other sensors can provide multiparametric data of the marine environment surrounding marine renewable energy installations. The aim of this study was to test the possibilities of observing the occurrence of fish and marine mammals using a multibeam imaging sonar system deployed at a wave power test site. The results obtained from a ten-day data set proved the platform as suitable for long time underwater monitoring and also revealed that the occurrence of fish and marine mammals was distributed across characteristic time and space domains. Large fish [&gt;0.4 m] frequently occurred at night-time and near the benthic zone. Small fish [&lt;0.2 m] frequently occurred during daylight and within the pelagic zone. The occurrence of seals was periodically distributed along a daily cycle, with intervals of 1–2 hours between maxima and minima. In conclusion, the use of multibeam imaging sonar can be a reliable technique for the qualitative and quantitative observations of fish and marine mammals in general and at marine renewable energy sites specifically, including protected and economically important species."
https://openalex.org/W4311263350,"The dosage of evocalcet required to control serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels varies among secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) patients. This post hoc analysis evaluated the dose-dependent efficacy of evocalcet on serum intact PTH (iPTH) levels, corrected calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) levels, and safety, in an evaluation period (week 28 to week 30) by stratifying the previous phase 3 data with the final evocalcet dosages (low 1–2 mg [131 patients], medium 3–4 mg [90 patients], high 5–8 mg [92 patients]), and identified pre-treatment patient characteristics predicting the use of higher final evocalcet dosages via univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. At the end of the study at week 30, the median serum iPTH level was higher and the achievement ratio for the target range of Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy (60–240 pg/mL) was lower in the final high-dose subgroup (216 pg/mL and 58%, respectively) than in the other subgroups (low: 149 pg/mL and 79%; medium: 149 pg/mL and 73%, respectively). Among the three subgroups, the mean serum corrected Ca and P levels demonstrated similar trends, and similar ratio of patients achieved the target range (corrected Ca, 8.4–10 mg/dL; P, 3.5–6.0 mg/dL) from week 28 to week 30. No dose-dependent safety concerns were identified. Younger age, prior cinacalcet use, higher serum levels of iPTH and corrected Ca, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide, intact fibroblast growth factor-23, and larger maximum parathyroid gland volume were significantly associated with final high-dose evocalcet ( p &lt; 0.05 in all cases). Patients requiring final high-dose evocalcet had pre-treatment characteristics indicating severe SHPT, leading to a lower final achievement rate for the target PTH levels of Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy. Therefore, the early initiation of evocalcet treatment for SHPT is critical. Trial registration : This trial was registered as follows: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02549391 and JAPIC: JapicCTI-153013 ."
https://openalex.org/W4311314373,"Background Stillbirth is an unfavorable outcome of pregnancy, which is still prevalent in many countries despite remarkable efforts made to improve the care of pregnant women. While producing estimates consistent with other national reports, all are hindered by limited data and important causes of death are likely to be missed. However; there is a scarcity of data on stillbirth in Ethiopia particularly in the Wolaita zone. Objective To assess the prevalence and associated factors of stillbirth among women giving birth at public hospitals in the Wolaita zone, southern Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in public hospitals in the Wolaita zone. A stratified sampling technique was used to select 737 women. A pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were entered using Epidata version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were used and the crude and adjusted odds ratios at a 95% confidence interval with P-value &lt;0.05 were considered to declare the result as statistically significant. Result This study reported an 8.7% [95% CI: 6.5–10.8] prevalence of stillbirth. Women who lived in rural areas, had pregnancy and labor complications, a high number of pregnancies, a prior history of stillbirth, and a complicated delivery were associated with stillbirth. When compared to urban residents, being a rural resident increased the risk of stillbirth by 2.57 fold [adjusted OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.23, 5.40]. When compared to their counterparts, women who experienced complications during pregnancy and labor increased 6.23 fold [AOR = 6.23, 95% CI: 2.67–14.58], having a previous history of stillbirth increased 6.89 fold [AOR = 6.89, 95% CI: 2.57–13.57], and the type of delivery increased 7.13 fold the risk of stillbirth [AOR = 7.13, 95% CI: 2.71–18.73]. Conclusion and recommendation The prevalence of stillbirth among women who gave birth in public hospitals in the Wolaita zone was found to be high compared to national and regional figures. Therefore, the federal and regional governments should strengthen inter-sectoral collaboration with health facilities to promote the maternal and health care services utilization. The zonal health department and other concerned bodies should focus on the implementation of the strategies and policies that address and reduce the causes of stillbirth."
https://openalex.org/W4311314404,"Objectives The aim of this study was to assess return to work following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and compare working status after open surgical clipping and endovascular treatment. Methods This nationwide registry-based study included all adult patients in working age treated for a ruptured intracranial aneurysm in Norway between 2008 and 2018 who had a record of sickness leave on the day of treatment. Data from The Norwegian Patient Registry and The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration were linked on an individual level. Daily sickness and disability benefits recipiency one year preoperatively to one year postoperatively was analysed. Return to work after endovascular treatment and surgical clipping was compared. Results 183 patients were included in the study. Among patients who worked at one year preoperatively, 57% had returned to work one year after treatment. Mean number of days from treatment to the first day back at work in a continuous 3-month working period was 298 (95% CI: 276–321) vs. 319 (95% CI: 299–339) for patients who underwent endovascular treatment compared to patients treated with clipping ( p = 0.365). Older patients were less likely to return to work after treatment (hazard ratio 0.977 per year of age, 95% CI 0.956–1.000, p = 0.046). There was no significant association between return to work and patient sex or location of the aneurysm. Conclusions Aneurysmal SAH profoundly affects patient working status. This study found no significant difference in time to return to work after treatment between patients treated with endovascular techniques compared to patients undergoing open surgery."

Limitations in cost, time, sample size, and control across current in-vitro and in-vivo methods limit future exploration of novel treatments. Presented is the verification of a novel reciprocating positive displacement pump aimed at resolving these issues through the simulation of human ocular, human fingertip and skin surface, human cerebral, and rodent spleen organ systems. A range of pulsatile amplitudes, frequencies, and flow rates were simulated using pumps made of 3D printed parts incorporating a tubing system, check valve and proprietary software. Volumetric analysis of 430 total readings across a flow range of 0.025ml/min to 16ml/min determined that the pump had a mean absolute error and mean relative error of 0.041 ml/min and 1.385%, respectively. Linear regression analysis compared to expected flow rate across the full flow range yielded an R 2 of 0.9996. Waveform analysis indicated that the pump could recreate accurate beat frequency for flow ranges above 0.06ml/min at 70BPM. The verification of accurate pump output opens avenues for the development of novel long-term in-vitro benchtop models capable of looking at fluid flow scenarios previously unfeasible, including low volume-high shear rate pulsatile flow."

Meanwhile, the threshold effect model test results reveal that basic research investment plays a more significant role in promotion when the per capita income level exceeds a certain threshold. (2) The test results of the mediating effect model indicate that the improvement of the level of human capital is the intermediate channel through which the investment in basic research affects regional economic growth efficiency, while the mediating effect of the increase of knowledge storage on the process of the investment in basic research affecting regional economic growth efficiency is not supported by data.

https://openalex.org/W4311326791,"Most of the studies on functional outcomes in pediatric survivors of cancers and bone marrow failure disorders have been conducted in North American, European, and Oceanian populations, with few studies having been performed in China. The objective of this study was to evaluate psychosocial outcomes in a cohort of Chinese pediatric survivors diagnosed with cancer or conditions requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and to identify clinical and behavioral factors associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes.This was a cross-sectional survey study. We recruited pediatric survivors of cancer or inherited disorder requiring HSCT at ≤18 years old and were ≥6 months post-treatment. Parents completed the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital After Completion of Therapy questionnaire to report their child's emotional functioning, social functioning, attention/concentration and behavior. Multivariable general linear modeling was used to identify clinical, treatment and behavioral factors associated with psychosocial outcomes, adjusting for sex, age and cancer diagnoses.Ninety-five pediatric survivors were recruited (62.1% male; mean [standard deviation] age 9.7 [3.4] years; 4.1 [2.6] years post-diagnosis). They were diagnosed with bone marrow failure disorders (23.2%), hematological malignancies (45.3%) or solid tumors (23.2%). Compared with survivors with no current health problems, those with more than one current health problem performed worse in emotional functioning (Estimate = 2.42, SE = 0.88, P = 0.008) and social functioning (Estimate = 2.90, SE = 1.64, P = 0.03). Higher pain interference was significantly associated with worse emotional functioning (Estimate = 0.19, SE = 0.08, P = 0.03) and attention functioning (Estimate = 0.26, SE = 0.11, P = 0.03). Compared with survivors who reported less sleep problems, those who had more sleep problems demonstrated poorer emotional functioning (Estimate = 0.30, SE = 0.08, P = 0.001). Survivors who had a longer duration of screen usage per day reported more impairment on attention and behavior functioning than those who had a shorter duration of screen usage per day (both P<0.5).Survivors who were diagnosed at a younger age or had unaddressed/untreated health problems may require additional psychological evaluation. The implementation of psychosocial assessments during routine long-term follow-up care may help to identify high-risk patients during the early phase of survivorship. Rehabilitation interventions should address modifiable behavioral factors (e.g. sleep habits, screen time and chronic pain)."
https://openalex.org/W4311326795,"The growing issue of demand-supply management between the prosumers and the local energy market requires an efficient and reliable energy management model. The microlayers, such as prosumers, energy districts, and macro players, namely retail dealers and wholesale dealers play a pivotal role in achieving mutual benefits. The stochastic nature of renewable energy generation in energy districts requires an effective model that can contemplate all stochastic complexities. Therefore, this paper proposes a mutual trade model between energy districts and smart grid to authorize the prosumers for mutual energy transactions under the stochastic adaptive-service level agreement. Moreover, multiple smart contacts are developed between the stakeholders to design adaptability and stochastic behavior of wind speed and solar irradiance. The real-time adaptations of the stochastic adaptive-service level agreement are based on technical beneficial feasibility and achieved through stochastic and adaptive functions. The optimized solution based on a genetic algorithm is proposed for the energy cost and energy surplus of prosumers and output parameters of the mutual trade model (grid revenue). In the context of mutual benefits associated with balanced demand and supply, the economic load dispatch and simplex method maximization are used for optimized demand-supply energy management. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive and stochastic mutual trade model is validated through simulation and statistical analysis."

Considering breeding methods, on average our respondents were willing to pay a small premium for table grapes developed using conventional breeding rather than gene editing (e.g., CRISPR). Results from a latent class model identify four different groups of consumers with distinct preferences for grape quality attributes and breeding technologies. The group of consumers most likely to reject gene editing considers both genetic engineering and gene editing to be breeding technologies that produce foods that are morally unacceptable and not safe to eat."
https://openalex.org/W4311327454,"Introduction This study was conducted with the objective to analyze the out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare expenditure and catastrophic healthcare expenditure (CHE) on chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCD) among the elderly population, and the association of CHE on CNCD with associated factors among the same population. Materials and methods We collected data from the elderly population of Dharan Sub-metropolitan city of the Eastern Nepal via door-to-door survey and face-to-face interview. The ten wards out of twenty were chosen by lottery method, and the equal proportion out of 280 samples was purposively chosen from each of ten wards (28 participants from each selected ward). The data were entered in Microsoft Excel 2019 v16.0 and statistical analysis was performed by using statistical package for social sciences, IBM SPSS® v21. The chi-square test was used to test the group differences. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine independent factors associated with CHE (all variables with P &lt; 0.20), and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were calculated at 95% confidence interval (CI). Results The median household, food and health expenditures were 95325 (72112.50–126262.50), 45000 (33000–60000) and 2100 (885.00–6107.50) NPR respectively. The proportion of the participants with CHE was 14.6%. The single living participants had 3.4 times higher odds of catastrophic health expenditure (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.2–9.6, P-value = 0.022) than those who are married. Similarly, those who had cancer had 0.1 times lower odds of CHE (AOR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.0–0.2, P-value = &lt;0.001) than those without cancer. Conclusion The elder population had significant financial health shocks due to chronic health ailments. There should be the provision of mandatory health insurance programmes for elderly to cut down the catastrophic healthcare expenditure. Similarly, there should be the provision of exemption scheme for vulnerable elderly who are more likely to face catastrophic expenditure from all available health facilities."
https://openalex.org/W4311439357,"The vast majority of reports mainly focus on the steady-state performance of parameter estimation. Few findings are reported for the instantaneous performance of parameter estimation because the instantaneous performance is difficult to quantify by using the design algorithm, for example, in the initial stage of parameter estimation, the error of parameter estimation varies in a specific region on the basis of the user’s request. With that in mind, we design an identification algorithm to address the transient performance of the parameter estimations. In this study, the parameter estimation of nonlinear sandwich system is studied by using the predefined constraint technology and high-effective filter. To achieve the above purpose, the estimation error information reflecting the transient performance of parameter estimation is procured using the developed some intermediate variables. Then, a predefined constraint function is used to prescribe the error convergence boundary, in which the convergence rate is lifted. An error equivalent conversion technique is then employed to obtain the transformed error data for establishing an parameter adaptive update law, in which the estimation error convergence and the predefined domain can be achieved. In comparison with the available estimation schemes, the good instantaneous performance is obtained on the basis of the numerical example and practical process results."
https://openalex.org/W4311439360,"Human economic decision-making sometimes appears to be irrational. Partly, this is due to cognitive biases that can lead to suboptimal economic choices and context-dependent risk-preferences. A pertinent question is whether such biases are part of our evolutionary heritage or whether they are culturally acquired. To address this, we tested gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and orang-utans (Pongo abelii) with two risk-assessment experiments that differed in how risk was presented. For both experiments, we found that subjects increased their preferences for the risky options as their expected gains increased, showing basic understanding of reward contingencies and rational decision-making. However, we also found consistent differences in risk proneness between the two experiments, as subjects were risk-neutral in one experiment and risk-prone in the other. We concluded that gorillas and orang-utans are economically rational but that their decisions can interact with pre-existing cognitive biases which modulates their risk-preference in context-dependent ways, explaining the variability of their risk-preference in previous literature."
https://openalex.org/W4311439460,"Background The National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) and the European Society of Cardiology recommend using low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as a treatment target for cholesterol lowering therapy. The Friedewald formula underestimates LDL-C in non-fasted and hypertriglyceridemia patients. This study aimed to compare measured LDL-C to calculated LDL-C in diabetic patients using the Friedewald and Martin-Hopkins formulae. Methods The data of 1 247 adult diabetes patients were retrospectively evaluated, and included triglycerides (TG), LDL-C, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol that were measured on the Roche Cobas® c702. Passing-Bablok regression analysis was used to determine the degree of agreement between measured LDL-C and calculated LDL-C using both formulae. The Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the bias at medical decision limits based on the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice. Results Both formulae showed a good linear relationship against measured LDL-C. However, the Martin-Hopkins formula outperformed the Friedewald formula at LDL-C treatment target &lt;1.4mmol/L. The Friedewald formula and the Martin-Hopkins formula had 14.9% and 10.9% mean positive bias, respectively. At TG-C ≥1.7 mmol/L, the Martin-Hopkins formula had a lower mean positive bias of 4.2% (95% CI 3.0–5.5) compared to the Friedewald formula, which had a mean positive bias of 21.8% (95% CI 19.9–23), which was higher than the NCEP ATP III recommended total allowable limit of 12%. Conclusion The Martin-Hopkins formula performed better than the Friedewald formula at LDL-C of 1.4 mmol/L and showed the least positive bias in patients with hypertriglyceridemia."

Low male involvement in preventative MTCT (PMTCT) in Burkina Faso is partially associated with increased MTCT rates in the country. Male involvement is at the intersection of individual experiences, social locations, organizational and systemic forces. It is crucial that PMTCT interventions are co-designed with all stakeholders, using approaches which account for such interconnected elements. This study, aims to provide a deeper understanding of male involvement using an intersectionality framework.We used an intersectional theoretical approach as it positions male involvement at the intersection of social location, systemic forces, individual experiences, and dynamics within couples. We applied an interpretative qualitative description design. The study was performed at St-Camille's hospital in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Our sample was theoretical to contrast for individual experiences and socioeconomic characteristics. Eligible women were identified via chart review and invited to participate with their male partners. We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with 12 couples. We performed a semantic thematic analysis using QDA Miner to identify themes and patterns among subjective perspectives, while accounting for variations between individuals.We interviewed 12 couples; 6 were serodiscordant. All women were HIV-positive. Participant ages ranged from 23 to 48 years. We found male involvement to be multidimensional and multifaceted, covering a large spectrum (from rejection to true partnership) and diverse involvement. Male involvement was limited by competing priorities, contradictory expectations, organizational opportunities and societal beliefs. We found interactions with caregivers impacted male involvement.This study contributed to enhancing our understanding of male involvement in PMTCT of HIV as a dynamic result of the interconnected individual, organizational and systemic experiences. Increasing male involvement will require implementation of coordinated interventions. Such interventions must strive to simultaneously integrate individual, organizational and systemic actions together."

In the 30 patients, bacteria were detected by reverse transcription- quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 19 blood samples (detection rate, 63%) and in 11 aneurysmal wall samples (detection rate, 37%). In the gut microbiota analysis, the Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes ratio was increased. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was higher (2.94 ± 1.77 vs 1.96 ± 0.61, P &lt; 0.05) and the lymphocyte-monocyte ratio was lower (4.02 ± 1.25 vs 5.86 ± 1.38, P &lt; 0.01) in the bacterial carrier group than in the bacterial non-carrier group in blood samples. The volume of intraluminal thrombus was significantly higher in the bacterial carrier group than in the bacterial non-carrier group in aneurysmal wall samples (64.0% vs 34.7%, P &lt; 0.05). We confirmed gut dysbiosis and bacterial translocation to the blood and aneurysmal wall in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm. There appears to be a relationship between the gut microbiota and abdominal aortic aneurysm."

Specifically, local seed sourcing has been extensively promoted, based on the expected adaptation of the populations to local conditions, but there are some limitations for the application. We analyzed Strict-sense local and Wide-sense local (based on climatic similarity) seed sourcing strategies. We determined species and genetic pools based on these strategies for 40 species and deployment zones in Spain. We also obtained the total number of seed sources and stands for these species in the EU countries. We analyzed the richness of the pools, the relationship with variables related to the use of the species in afforestation, and the availability of seed production areas approved for the production of reproductive material destined to be marketed. This study confirms the existence of extensive species and genetic local pools. Also, that the importance of these pools differs for different species, limitations being derived from the use of forest reproductive material and the existence of approved basic materials. Strategies derived from local seed sourcing approaches are the basis for the use of forest reproductive material because a large number of the species in the area considered in the study are under regulation. However, despite the extensive work done to approve basic materials, limitations based on the availability of seed production areas to provide local material for sustainable forestry are found in those species. Considering a Wide-sense local seed sourcing strategy we provide alternative pools in order to meet social demands under the actual regulations on marketing of reproductive materials."
https://openalex.org/W4311439693,"Engineered bacteria could perform many functions in the environment, for example, to remediate pollutants, deliver nutrients to crops or act as in-field biosensors. Model organisms can be unreliable in the field, but selecting an isolate from the thousands that naturally live there and genetically manipulating them to carry the desired function is a slow and uninformed process. Here, we demonstrate the parallel engineering of isolates from environmental samples by using the broad-host-range XPORT conjugation system ( Bacillus subtilis mini-ICE Bs 1) to transfer a genetic payload to many isolates in parallel. Bacillus and Lysinibacillus species were obtained from seven soil and water samples from different locations in Israel. XPORT successfully transferred a genetic function (reporter expression) into 25 of these isolates. They were then screened to identify the best-performing chassis based on the expression level, doubling time, functional stability in soil, and environmentally-relevant traits of its closest annotated reference species, such as the ability to sporulate and temperature tolerance. From this library, we selected Bacillus frigoritolerans A3E1, re-introduced it to soil, and measured function and genetic stability in a contained environment that replicates jungle conditions. After 21 months of storage, the engineered bacteria were viable, could perform their function, and did not accumulate disruptive mutations."
https://openalex.org/W4311441332,"Surveillance of antimicrobial administration in livestock production is an important factor in global policies to reduce spreading of antimicrobial resistance. In recent years, many studies have been carried out concerning the usage of antimicrobials in animal production and in some countries recording of antimicrobial quantities dispensed to famers is mandatory. On cattle farms, antimicrobial treatments are recorded for fattening calves under 8 months of age and for fattening cattle older than 8 months in Germany and treatment frequencies are then calculated. However, with the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2019/6 on 01/28/2022, antimicrobial monitoring will gradually be extended to all animal species and age groups. Therefore, an effective, fast and accurate transfer of data on the use of antimicrobials, especially in the field of livestock farming, into corresponding databases is required to determine the treatment frequencies for the individual animal species or types of use. For this purpose, an electronic interface was programmed to transfer the data on antimicrobial use in dairy cattle farms from a herd management software program directly into a database. To test the practicability and effectiveness of this interface, 10 dairy cattle farms from Saxony were initially selected. Based on an in-depth analysis of the treatment frequencies of antimicrobial administration of 7 different age groups of animals after a two-year observation period, the functionality of the electronic interface could be established. The greatest potential for reduction of antimicrobials is in newborn calves, as they represent the age group with the highest treatment frequency."
https://openalex.org/W4311441346,"Human mobility datasets collected from personal mobile device locations are integral to understanding how states, counties, and cities have collectively adapted to pervasive social disruption stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, while indigenous tribal communities in the United States have been disproportionately devastated by the pandemic, the relatively sparse populations and data available in these hard-hit tribal areas often exclude them from mobility studies. We explore the effects of sparse mobility data in untangling the often inter-correlated relationship between human mobility, distancing orders, and case growth throughout 2020 in tribal and rural areas of California. Our findings account for data sparsity imprecision to show: 1) Mobility through legal tribal boundaries was unusually low but still correlated highly with case growth; 2) Case growth correlated less strongly with mobility later in the the year in all areas; and 3) State-mandated distancing orders later in the year did not necessarily precede lower mobility medians, especially in tribal areas. It is our hope that with more timely feedback offered by mobile device datasets even in sparse areas, health policy makers can better plan health emergency responses that still keep the economy vibrant across all sectors."
https://openalex.org/W4311441735,"We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess whether disclosing elements of uncertainty in an initial public health statement will change the likelihood that participants will accept new, different advice that arises as more evidence is uncovered. Proportional odds models were fit, stratified by the baseline likelihood to agree with the final advice. 298 participants were randomized to the treatment arm and 298 in the control arm. Among participants who were more likely to agree with the final recommendation at baseline, those who were initially shown uncertainty had a 46% lower odds of being more likely to agree with the final recommendation compared to those who were not (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.27-1.03). Among participants who were less likely to agree with the final recommendation at baseline, those who were initially shown uncertainty have 1.61 times the odds of being more likely to agree with the final recommendation compared to those who were not (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.15-2.25). This has implications for public health leaders when assessing how to communicate a recommendation, suggesting communicating uncertainty influences whether someone will adhere to a future recommendation."
https://openalex.org/W4311458220,"As the aging of China's population continues to deepen, a number of elderly care facilities relying on community platforms to provide home care services have been established in urban communities, effectively alleviating the problem of difficult community elderly care, while a spatial mismatch between the facilities and the elderly population has also emerged. To solve this problem, this paper analyzes the equity in walking access to community home care facilities for elderly people with different mobility abilities in Lianhu District of Xi'an City, taking the resources of community home care facilities as the research object. Firstly, the coverage rate of the facilities was calculated based on the 15-minute walking range of the elderly with different mobility, and the accessibility of the facilities was measured using the Kernel Density-type two-step moving search method. Then, Gini coefficient, Lorenz curve and location entropy were used to analyze the spatial matching pattern of facilities and elderly population. The results show that there is a serious spatial mismatch between the resources of community home care facilities and the elderly population with mobility restriction. In addition, the available facility area per capita is low for more than 80% of the elderly with mobility restriction, and the road network density has a significant impact on the access of the elderly with mobility restriction to the community home care facility resources. These research results indicate that the spatial layout and configuration of community home care facilities are unfair to the elderly with poor mobility, and that these elderly care facility configurations do not favor the disadvantaged groups."
https://openalex.org/W4311458245,"Firearms cause the most suicides (60%) and homicides (36%) in the US. The high lethality and availability of firearms make them a particularly dangerous method of attempted violence. The aim of this study was to study US trends in firearm suicide and homicide mortality and years of potential life lost before age 75 (YPLL-75) between 1981 and 2020.Data in this cross-sectional study were collected between 1981 and 2020 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s WISQARS database for fatal injury and violence. Data from the US population were considered for all age groups and were divided by racial groups and sex for analysis.Those most heavily impacted by firearm homicide were Black, with homicide age-adjusted death rates almost seven times higher than White people. A spike in firearm homicide deaths occurred between 2019 and 2020, with Black people having the largest increase (39%). White people had the highest rates of firearm suicide, and suicide death rates increased between 2019 and 2020. Increases in homicide and suicide YPLL-75 between 2011 and 2020 had most heavily impacted minority populations. Men had a firearm suicide rate that was seven times higher than women, and a firearm homicide rate that was five times higher than women.This study demonstrated that Black and White men were most impacted by firearm deaths, and that firearm homicide and suicide rates increased between 2019 and 2020 for all racial groups except Asian/Pacific Islander. Our results suggest that prevention efforts should focus on specific demographic factors and articulate the urgency to mitigate firearm-related deaths in the US."
https://openalex.org/W4311486342,"We apply a heterogeneous graph convolution network (GCN) combined with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) denoted by GCNMLP to explore the potential side effects of drugs. Here the SIDER, OFFSIDERS, and FAERS are used as the datasets. We integrate the drug information with similar characteristics from the datasets of known drugs and side effect networks. The heterogeneous graph networks explore the potential side effects of drugs by inferring the relationship between similar drugs and related side effects. This novel in silico method will shorten the time spent in uncovering the unseen side effects within routine drug prescriptions while highlighting the relevance of exploring drug mechanisms from well-documented drugs. In our experiments, we inquire about the drugs Vancomycin, Amlodipine, Cisplatin, and Glimepiride from a trained model, where the parameters are acquired from the dataset SIDER after training. Our results show that the performance of the GCNMLP on these three datasets is superior to the non-negative matrix factorization method (NMF) and some well-known machine learning methods with respect to various evaluation scales. Moreover, new side effects of drugs can be obtained using the GCNMLP."
