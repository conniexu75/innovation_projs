https://openalex.org/W2036176224,"Analyses of the determinants of the specificity of Cas9 nuclease provide rules for selecting optimal target sites. The Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) nuclease can be efficiently targeted to genomic loci by means of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to enable genome editing1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here, we characterize SpCas9 targeting specificity in human cells to inform the selection of target sites and avoid off-target effects. Our study evaluates >700 guide RNA variants and SpCas9-induced indel mutation levels at >100 predicted genomic off-target loci in 293T and 293FT cells. We find that SpCas9 tolerates mismatches between guide RNA and target DNA at different positions in a sequence-dependent manner, sensitive to the number, position and distribution of mismatches. We also show that SpCas9-mediated cleavage is unaffected by DNA methylation and that the dosage of SpCas9 and sgRNA can be titrated to minimize off-target modification. To facilitate mammalian genome engineering applications, we provide a web-based software tool to guide the selection and validation of target sequences as well as off-target analyses."
https://openalex.org/W1977213877,"The lack of therapies for progressive multiple sclerosis highlights the need to understand the regenerative process of remyelination that can follow CNS demyelination. This involves an innate immune response consisting of microglia and macrophages, which can be polarized to distinct functional phenotypes: pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory or immunoregulatory (M2). We found that a switch from an M1- to an M2-dominant response occurred in microglia and peripherally derived macrophages as remyelination started. Oligodendrocyte differentiation was enhanced in vitro with M2 cell conditioned media and impaired in vivo following intra-lesional M2 cell depletion. M2 cell densities were increased in lesions of aged mice in which remyelination was enhanced by parabiotic coupling to a younger mouse and in multiple sclerosis lesions that normally show remyelination. Blocking M2 cell-derived activin-A inhibited oligodendrocyte differentiation during remyelination in cerebellar slice cultures. Thus, our results indicate that M2 cell polarization is essential for efficient remyelination and identify activin-A as a therapeutic target for CNS regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2047964244,"Visual cortical neurons fire at higher rates to visual stimuli during locomotion than during immobility, while maintaining orientation selectivity. The mechanisms underlying this change in gain are not understood. We performed whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 and layer 4 visual cortical excitatory neurons and from parvalbumin-positive and somatostatin-positive inhibitory neurons in mice that were free to rest or run on a spherical treadmill. We found that the membrane potential of all cell types became more depolarized and (with the exception of somatostatin-positive interneurons) less variable during locomotion. Cholinergic input was essential for maintaining the unimodal membrane potential distribution during immobility, whereas noradrenergic input was necessary for the tonic depolarization associated with locomotion. Our results provide a mechanism for how neuromodulation controls the gain and signal-to-noise ratio of visual cortical neurons during changes in the state of vigilance."
https://openalex.org/W2117737648,"The dynamics of adaptation determine which mutations fix in a population, and hence how reproducible evolution will be. This is central to understanding the spectra of mutations recovered in the evolution of antibiotic resistance, the response of pathogens to immune selection, and the dynamics of cancer progression. In laboratory evolution experiments, demonstrably beneficial mutations are found repeatedly, but are often accompanied by other mutations with no obvious benefit. Here we use whole-genome whole-population sequencing to examine the dynamics of genome sequence evolution at high temporal resolution in 40 replicate Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations growing in rich medium for 1,000 generations. We find pervasive genetic hitchhiking: multiple mutations arise and move synchronously through the population as mutational 'cohorts'. Multiple clonal cohorts are often present simultaneously, competing with each other in the same population. Our results show that patterns of sequence evolution are driven by a balance between these chance effects of hitchhiking and interference, which increase stochastic variation in evolutionary outcomes, and the deterministic action of selection on individual mutations, which favours parallel evolutionary solutions in replicate populations."
https://openalex.org/W2078311582,"Connie Bezzina, Richard Redon and colleagues show that common variants at SCN5A-SCN10A and HEY2 are associated with Brugada syndrome, a rare disorder with high risk of sudden cardiac death. The newly discovered loci have a large cumulative effect on disease risk and illustrate how common variants can have a strong impact on predisposition to rare diseases. Brugada syndrome is a rare cardiac arrhythmia disorder, causally related to SCN5A mutations in around 20% of cases1,2,3. Through a genome-wide association study of 312 individuals with Brugada syndrome and 1,115 controls, we detected 2 significant association signals at the SCN10A locus (rs10428132) and near the HEY2 gene (rs9388451). Independent replication confirmed both signals (meta-analyses: rs10428132, P = 1.0 × 10−68; rs9388451, P = 5.1 × 10−17) and identified one additional signal in SCN5A (at 3p21; rs11708996, P = 1.0 × 10−14). The cumulative effect of the three loci on disease susceptibility was unexpectedly large (Ptrend = 6.1 × 10−81). The association signals at SCN5A-SCN10A demonstrate that genetic polymorphisms modulating cardiac conduction4,5,6,7 can also influence susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia. The implication of association with HEY2, supported by new evidence that Hey2 regulates cardiac electrical activity, shows that Brugada syndrome may originate from altered transcriptional programming during cardiac development8. Altogether, our findings indicate that common genetic variation can have a strong impact on the predisposition to rare diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2113000896,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly with type 16, causes a growing fraction of oropharyngeal cancers, whose incidence is increasing, mainly in developed countries. In a double-blind controlled trial conducted to investigate vaccine efficacy (VE) of the bivalent HPV 16/18 vaccine against cervical infections and lesions, we estimated VE against prevalent oral HPV infections 4 years after vaccination.A total of 7,466 women 18-25 years old were randomized (1∶1) to receive the HPV16/18 vaccine or hepatitis A vaccine as control. At the final blinded 4-year study visit, 5,840 participants provided oral specimens (91·9% of eligible women) to evaluate VE against oral infections. Our primary analysis evaluated prevalent oral HPV infection among all vaccinated women with oral and cervical HPV results. Corresponding VE against prevalent cervical HPV16/18 infection was calculated for comparison. Oral prevalence of identifiable mucosal HPV was relatively low (1·7%). Approximately four years after vaccination, there were 15 prevalent HPV16/18 infections in the control group and one in the vaccine group, for an estimated VE of 93·3% (95% CI = 63% to 100%). Corresponding efficacy against prevalent cervical HPV16/18 infection for the same cohort at the same visit was 72·0% (95% CI = 63% to 79%) (p versus oral VE = 0·04). There was no statistically significant protection against other oral HPV infections, though power was limited for these analyses.HPV prevalence four years after vaccination with the ASO4-adjuvanted HPV16/18 vaccine was much lower among women in the vaccine arm compared to the control arm, suggesting that the vaccine affords strong protection against oral HPV16/18 infection, with potentially important implications for prevention of increasingly common HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2067829962,"The genome of the asexual rotifer Adineta vaga lacks homologous chromosomes; instead, its allelic regions are rearranged and sometimes found on the same chromosome in a palindromic fashion, a structure reminiscent of the primate Y chromosome and of other mitotic lineages such as cancer cells. Bdelloid rotifers are thought to have persisted and diversified asexually for millions of years, which is odd because loss of sexual reproduction is widely considered to be an evolutionary dead end for metazoans. The suspicion remained that they might engage in sex on rare occasions. But here Olivier Jaillon and colleagues sequence the genome of a bdelloid rotifer, Adineta vaga, and show that its structure is incompatible with conventional meiosis, the type of cell division associated with sexual reproduction. The genome has undergone abundant gene conversion, which may limit the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the absence of meiosis. Up to 8% of the genes are of probable non-metazoan origin, probably acquired through horizontal gene transfer. These findings demonstrate positive evidence for asexual evolution, supporting the hypothesis of ancient asexuality among bdelloid rotifers. Loss of sexual reproduction is considered an evolutionary dead end for metazoans, but bdelloid rotifers challenge this view as they appear to have persisted asexually for millions of years1. Neither male sex organs nor meiosis have ever been observed in these microscopic animals: oocytes are formed through mitotic divisions, with no reduction of chromosome number and no indication of chromosome pairing2. However, current evidence does not exclude that they may engage in sex on rare, cryptic occasions. Here we report the genome of a bdelloid rotifer, Adineta vaga (Davis, 1873)3, and show that its structure is incompatible with conventional meiosis. At gene scale, the genome of A. vaga is tetraploid and comprises both anciently duplicated segments and less divergent allelic regions. However, in contrast to sexual species, the allelic regions are rearranged and sometimes even found on the same chromosome. Such structure does not allow meiotic pairing; instead, we find abundant evidence of gene conversion, which may limit the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the absence of meiosis. Gene families involved in resistance to oxidation, carbohydrate metabolism and defence against transposons are significantly expanded, which may explain why transposable elements cover only 3% of the assembled sequence. Furthermore, 8% of the genes are likely to be of non-metazoan origin and were probably acquired horizontally. This apparent convergence between bdelloids and prokaryotes sheds new light on the evolutionary significance of sex."
https://openalex.org/W2127173397,"Genome sequences of the Chinese hamster and six Chinese hamster ovary cell lines provide a resource to aid in improving production of recombinant proteins. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, first isolated in 1957, are the preferred production host for many therapeutic proteins. Although genetic heterogeneity among CHO cell lines has been well documented, a systematic, nucleotide-resolution characterization of their genotypic differences has been stymied by the lack of a unifying genomic resource for CHO cells. Here we report a 2.4-Gb draft genome sequence of a female Chinese hamster, Cricetulus griseus, harboring 24,044 genes. We also resequenced and analyzed the genomes of six CHO cell lines from the CHO-K1, DG44 and CHO-S lineages. This analysis identified hamster genes missing in different CHO cell lines, and detected >3.7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 551,240 indels and 7,063 copy number variations. Many mutations are located in genes with functions relevant to bioprocessing, such as apoptosis. The details of this genetic diversity highlight the value of the hamster genome as the reference upon which CHO cells can be studied and engineered for protein production."
https://openalex.org/W1982237578,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a food allergy-associated inflammatory disease characterized by esophageal eosinophilia. Current management strategies for EoE are nonspecific, and thus there is a need to identify specific immunological pathways that could be targeted to treat this disease. EoE is associated with polymorphisms in the gene that encodes thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine that promotes allergic inflammation, but how TSLP might contribute to EoE disease pathogenesis has been unclear. Here, we describe a new mouse model of EoE-like disease that developed independently of IgE, but was dependent on TSLP and basophils, as targeting TSLP or basophils during the sensitization phase limited disease. Notably, therapeutic TSLP neutralization or basophil depletion also ameliorated established EoE-like disease. In human subjects with EoE, we observed elevated TSLP expression and exaggerated basophil responses in esophageal biopsies, and a gain-of-function TSLP polymorphism was associated with increased basophil responses in patients with EoE. Together, these data suggest that the TSLP-basophil axis contributes to the pathogenesis of EoE and could be therapeutically targeted to treat this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2021724765,"Irreversible blindness caused by loss of photoreceptors may be amenable to cell therapy. We previously demonstrated retinal repair and restoration of vision through transplantation of photoreceptor precursors obtained from postnatal retinas into visually impaired adult mice. Considerable progress has been made in differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro toward photoreceptor lineages. However, the capability of ESC-derived photoreceptors to integrate after transplantation has not been demonstrated unequivocally. Here, to isolate photoreceptor precursors fit for transplantation, we adapted a recently reported three-dimensional (3D) differentiation protocol that generates neuroretina from mouse ESCs. We show that rod precursors derived by this protocol and selected via a GFP reporter under the control of a Rhodopsin promoter integrate within degenerate retinas of adult mice and mature into outer segment-bearing photoreceptors. Notably, ESC-derived precursors at a developmental stage similar to postnatal days 4-8 integrate more efficiently compared with cells at other stages. This study shows conclusively that ESCs can provide a source of photoreceptors for retinal cell transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W1996212779,"Heymut Omran, Joseph LoTurco and colleagues show that mutations in the dyslexia susceptibility candidate gene DYX1C1 cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. Their functional studies suggest that DYX1C1 is required for the cytoplasmic preassembly of axonemal dynein complexes. DYX1C1 has been associated with dyslexia and neuronal migration in the developing neocortex. Unexpectedly, we found that deleting exons 2–4 of Dyx1c1 in mice caused a phenotype resembling primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by chronic airway disease, laterality defects and male infertility. This phenotype was confirmed independently in mice with a Dyx1c1 c.T2A start-codon mutation recovered from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen. Morpholinos targeting dyx1c1 in zebrafish also caused laterality and ciliary motility defects. In humans, we identified recessive loss-of-function DYX1C1 mutations in 12 individuals with PCD. Ultrastructural and immunofluorescence analyses of DYX1C1-mutant motile cilia in mice and humans showed disruptions of outer and inner dynein arms (ODAs and IDAs, respectively). DYX1C1 localizes to the cytoplasm of respiratory epithelial cells, its interactome is enriched for molecular chaperones, and it interacts with the cytoplasmic ODA and IDA assembly factor DNAAF2 (KTU). Thus, we propose that DYX1C1 is a newly identified dynein axonemal assembly factor (DNAAF4)."
https://openalex.org/W2042967115,"The basic determinant of chromosome inheritance, the centromere, is specified in many eukaryotes by an epigenetic mark. Using gene targeting in human cells and fission yeast, chromatin containing the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A is demonstrated to be the epigenetic mark that acts through a two-step mechanism to identify, maintain and propagate centromere function indefinitely. Initially, centromere position is replicated and maintained by chromatin assembled with the centromere-targeting domain (CATD) of CENP-A substituted into H3. Subsequently, nucleation of kinetochore assembly onto CATD-containing chromatin is shown to require either the amino- or carboxy-terminal tail of CENP-A for recruitment of inner kinetochore proteins, including stabilizing CENP-B binding to human centromeres or direct recruitment of CENP-C, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1970581324,"In this study, Mazzoni et al. describe the mechanism behind the combinatorial action of transcription factors in cell type specification. Specifically, the authors reveal that Isl1 cooperates with Phox2a or Lhx3 in programming modules that regulate differential specification of spinal motor neurons vs. cranial motor neurons. Efficient transcriptional programming promises to open new frontiers in regenerative medicine. However, mechanisms by which programming factors transform cell fate are unknown, preventing more rational selection of factors to generate desirable cell types. Three transcription factors, Ngn2, Isl1 and Lhx3, were sufficient to program rapidly and efficiently spinal motor neuron identity when expressed in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells. Replacement of Lhx3 by Phox2a led to specification of cranial, rather than spinal, motor neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing analysis of Isl1, Lhx3 and Phox2a binding sites revealed that the two cell fates were programmed by the recruitment of Isl1-Lhx3 and Isl1-Phox2a complexes to distinct genomic locations characterized by a unique grammar of homeodomain binding motifs. Our findings suggest that synergistic interactions among transcription factors determine the specificity of their recruitment to cell type–specific binding sites and illustrate how a single transcription factor can be repurposed to program different cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2024049038,"Although oxytocin is generally thought to exert anxiolytic, prosocial and antistress effects, reports of anxiogenic effects in humans have recently emerged. Here the authors show that oxytocin receptors in the lateral septum mediate the stress-induced enhancement of fear conditioning in mice in a process involving MAPK-ERK signaling. The nonapeptide oxytocin is considered beneficial to mental health due to its anxiolytic, prosocial and antistress effects, but evidence for anxiogenic actions of oxytocin in humans has recently emerged. Using region-specific manipulations of the mouse oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) gene (Oxtr), we identified the lateral septum as the brain region mediating fear-enhancing effects of Oxtr. These effects emerge after social defeat and require Oxtr specifically coupled to the extracellular signal–regulated protein kinase pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2036615809,"A population of multipotent cardiopulmonary mesoderm progenitors (CPPs) within the posterior pole of the heart expresses Wnt2, Gli1 and Isl1; these CPPs arise from cardiac progenitors before lung development, generate the mesoderm lineages within the cardiac inflow tract and lung, and are regulated by hedgehog expression from the foregut endoderm. The cardiovascular and respiratory systems require precise co-development to form the gas exchange interface for oxygenation of blood, but how do the heart and lung develop together? Using a series of mouse models to perform both cell-fate and loss-of-function analyses, Edward Morrisey and colleagues have now identified a population of multipotent cardiopulmonary progenitors within the posterior pole of the heart that coordinates heart and lung co-development. The authors propose that the heart and lung have evolved an intricate and precise co-developmental process to ensure postnatal viability of terrestrial animals. Co-development of the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems is a recent evolutionary adaption to terrestrial life that couples cardiac output with the gas exchange function of the lung1. Here we show that the murine pulmonary vasculature develops even in the absence of lung development. We have identified a population of multipotent cardiopulmonary mesoderm progenitors (CPPs) within the posterior pole of the heart that are marked by the expression of Wnt2, Gli1 and Isl1. We show that CPPs arise from cardiac progenitors before lung development. Lineage tracing and clonal analysis demonstrates that CPPs generate the mesoderm lineages within the cardiac inflow tract and lung including cardiomyocytes, pulmonary vascular and airway smooth muscle, proximal vascular endothelium, and pericyte-like cells. CPPs are regulated by hedgehog expression from the foregut endoderm, which is required for connection of the pulmonary vasculature to the heart. Together, these studies identify a novel population of multipotent cardiopulmonary progenitors that coordinates heart and lung co-development that is required for adaptation to terrestrial existence."
https://openalex.org/W2041992457,"Acquired chromosomal instability and copy number alterations are hallmarks of cancer. Enzymes capable of promoting site-specific copy number changes have yet to be identified. Here, we demonstrate that H3K9/36me3 lysine demethylase KDM4A/JMJD2A overexpression leads to localized copy gain of 1q12, 1q21, and Xq13.1 without global chromosome instability. KDM4A-amplified tumors have increased copy gains for these same regions. 1q12h copy gain occurs within a single cell cycle, requires S phase, and is not stable but is regenerated each cell division. Sites with increased copy number are rereplicated and have increased KDM4A, MCM, and DNA polymerase occupancy. Suv39h1/KMT1A or HP1γ overexpression suppresses the copy gain, whereas H3K9/K36 methylation interference promotes gain. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of a chromatin modifier results in site-specific copy gains. This begins to establish how copy number changes could originate during tumorigenesis and demonstrates that transient overexpression of specific chromatin modulators could promote these events."

https://openalex.org/W2167994245,"We compared the human and mouse X chromosomes to systematically test Ohno's law, which states that the gene content of X chromosomes is conserved across placental mammals. First, we improved the accuracy of the human X-chromosome reference sequence through single-haplotype sequencing of ampliconic regions. The new sequence closed gaps in the reference sequence, corrected previously misassembled regions and identified new palindromic amplicons. Our subsequent analysis led us to conclude that the evolution of human and mouse X chromosomes was bimodal. In accord with Ohno's law, 94-95% of X-linked single-copy genes are shared by humans and mice; most are expressed in both sexes. Notably, most X-ampliconic genes are exceptions to Ohno's law: only 31% of human and 22% of mouse X-ampliconic genes had orthologs in the other species. X-ampliconic genes are expressed predominantly in testicular germ cells, and many were independently acquired since divergence from the common ancestor of humans and mice, specializing portions of their X chromosomes for sperm production."
https://openalex.org/W2119374287,"During translation initiation in eukaryotes, the small ribosomal subunit binds messenger RNA at the 5′ end and scans in the 5′ to 3′ direction to locate the initiation codon, form the 80S initiation complex and start protein synthesis. This simple, yet intricate, process is guided by multiple initiation factors. Here we determine the structures of three complexes of the small ribosomal subunit that represent distinct steps in mammalian translation initiation. These structures reveal the locations of eIF1, eIF1A, mRNA and initiator transfer RNA bound to the small ribosomal subunit and provide insights into the details of translation initiation specific to eukaryotes. Conformational changes associated with the captured functional states reveal the dynamics of the interactions in the P site of the ribosome. These results have functional implications for the mechanism of mRNA scanning. Three structures of the eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit in complex with initiator tRNA, mRNA and the initiation factors eIF1 and eIF1A have been solved; these structures offer insight into the contributions of the initiation factors, the mechanism by which mRNA is scanned, and the interactions that occur in the ribosome’s P site. When translation is initiated, only the small subunit of the ribosome binds to the messenger RNA. Once the initiation codon has been identified, by translocating or 'scanning' along the mRNA, the large subunit combines with the small subunit to reconstitute a full ribosome. Ivan Lomakin and Thomas Steitz have solved three structures of the eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit in complex with initiator tRNA, mRNA, and the initiation factors eIF1 and eIF1A. These structures offer insight into the contributions of the initiation factors, the mechanism by which mRNA is scanned, and the interactions that occur in the ribosome's P site."
https://openalex.org/W2077569666,"Monitoring the half-life of mutant huntingtin protein reveals how specific neurons are more susceptible to its toxic effects and to Huntington's disease. In polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, only certain neurons die, despite widespread expression of the offending protein. PolyQ expansion may induce neurodegeneration by impairing proteostasis, but protein aggregation and toxicity tend to confound conventional measurements of protein stability. Here, we used optical pulse labeling to measure effects of polyQ expansions on the mean lifetime of a fragment of huntingtin, the protein that causes Huntington's disease, in living neurons. We show that polyQ expansion reduced the mean lifetime of mutant huntingtin within a given neuron and that the mean lifetime varied among neurons, indicating differences in their capacity to clear the polypeptide. We found that neuronal longevity is predicted by the mean lifetime of huntingtin, as cortical neurons cleared mutant huntingtin faster and lived longer than striatal neurons. Thus, cell type–specific differences in turnover capacity may contribute to cellular susceptibility to toxic proteins, and efforts to bolster proteostasis in Huntington's disease, such as protein clearance, could be neuroprotective."
https://openalex.org/W2026860604,"Autophagy is a conserved process that delivers components of the cytoplasm to lysosomes for degradation. The E1 and E2 enzymes encoded by Atg7 and Atg3 are thought to be essential for autophagy involving the ubiquitin-like protein Atg8. Here, we describe an Atg7- and Atg3-independent autophagy pathway that facilitates programmed reduction of cell size during intestine cell death. Although multiple components of the core autophagy pathways, including Atg8, are required for autophagy and cells to shrink in the midgut of the intestine, loss of either Atg7 or Atg3 function does not influence these cellular processes. Rather, Uba1, the E1 enzyme used in ubiquitylation, is required for autophagy and reduction of cell size. Our data reveal that distinct autophagy programs are used by different cells within an animal, and disclose an unappreciated role for ubiquitin activation in autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2041108404,"Recent studies have demonstrated direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into a range of somatic cell types, but to date stem or progenitor cells have only been reprogrammed for the blood and neuronal lineages. We previously reported generation of induced hepatocyte-like (iHep) cells by transduction of Gata4, Hnf1α, and Foxa3 in p19 Arf null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Here, we show that Hnf1β and Foxa3, liver organogenesis transcription factors, are sufficient to reprogram MEFs into induced hepatic stem cells (iHepSCs). iHepSCs can be stably expanded in vitro and possess the potential of bidirectional differentiation into both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic lineages. In the injured liver of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah)-deficient mice, repopulating iHepSCs become hepatocyte-like cells. They also engraft as cholangiocytes into bile ducts of mice with DDC-induced bile ductular injury. Lineage conversion into bipotential expandable iHepSCs provides a strategy to enable efficient derivation of both hepatocytes and cholangiocytes for use in disease modeling and tissue engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2084856165,"Actin networks drive many essential cellular processes, including cell migration, cytokinesis and tissue morphogenesis. However, how cells organize and regulate dynamic actin networks that consist of long, unbranched actin filaments is only poorly understood. This study in mouse oocytes reveals that cells can use vesicles as adaptable, motorized network nodes to regulate the dynamics and density of intracellular actin networks. In particular, Rab11a-positive vesicles drive the network dynamics in a myosin-Vb-dependent manner, and modulate the network density by sequestering and clustering the network's actin nucleators. We also report a simple way by which networks of different densities can be generated, namely by adjusting the number and volume of vesicles in the cell. This vesicle-based mechanism of actin network modulation is essential for asymmetric positioning of the meiotic spindle in mouse oocytes, a vital step in the development of a fertilizable egg in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2059270106,"Since the initial discovery that OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC overexpression sufficed for the induction of pluripotency in somatic cells, methodologies replacing the original factors have enhanced our understanding of the reprogramming process. However, unlike in mouse, OCT4 has not been replaced successfully during reprogramming of human cells. Here we report on a strategy to accomplish this replacement. Through a combination of transcriptome and bioinformatic analysis we have identified factors previously characterized as being lineage specifiers that are able to replace OCT4 and SOX2 in the reprogramming of human fibroblasts. Our results show that it is possible to replace OCT4 and SOX2 simultaneously with alternative lineage specifiers in the reprogramming of human cells. At a broader level, they also support a model in which counteracting lineage specification networks underlies the induction of pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W1999513543,"This study shows that TMEM16C facilitates Slack potassium channel activity in the dorsal root ganglia in rats. By generating a gene knockout rat and using electrophysiology, the authors show that TMEM16C modulates mechanical and thermal pain processing by associating with Slack to enhance sodium-activated potassium channel activity. TMEM16C belongs to the TMEM16 family, which includes the Ca2+-activated Cl− channels TMEM16A and TMEM16B and a small-conductance, Ca2+-activated, nonselective cation channel (SCAN), TMEM16F. We found that in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) TMEM16C was expressed mainly in the IB4-positive, non-peptidergic nociceptors that also express the sodium-activated potassium (KNa) channel Slack. Together these channel proteins promote KNa channel activity and dampen neuronal excitability. DRG from TMEM16C knockout rats had diminished Slack expression, broadened action potentials and increased excitability. Moreover, the TMEM16C knockout rats, as well as rats with Slack knockdown by intrathecal injection of short interfering RNA, exhibited increased thermal and mechanical sensitivity. Experiments involving heterologous expression in HEK293 cells further showed that TMEM16C modulated the single-channel activity of Slack channels and increased its sodium sensitivity. Our study thus reveals that TMEM16C enhances KNa channel activity in DRG neurons and regulates the processing of pain messages."
https://openalex.org/W1981197649,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed treatment using trastuzumab has shown clinical benefit in HER2-positive gastric cancer. Clinical trials using lapatinib in HER2-positive gastric cancer are also currently underway. As with other molecularly targeted agents, the emergence of acquired resistance to HER2-directed treatment is an imminent therapeutic problem for HER2-positive gastric cancer. In order to investigate the mechanisms of acquired resistance to HER2-directed treatment in gastric cancer, we generated lapatinib-resistant gastric cancer cell lines (SNU216 LR) in vitro by chronic exposure of a HER2-positive gastric cancer cell line (SNU216) to lapatinib. The resultant SNU216 LR cells were also resistant to gefitinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab, afatinib and dacomitinib. Interestingly, SNU216 LR cells displayed an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and maintained the activation of MET, HER3, Stat3, Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the presence of lapatinib. Using gene expression arrays, we identified the upregulation of a variety of EMT-related genes and extracellular matrix molecules, such as Testican-1, in SNU216 LR cells. We showed that the inhibition of Testican-1 by small interfering RNA decreased Testican-1-induced, MET-dependent, downstream signaling, and restored sensitivity to lapatinib in these cells. Furthermore, treatment with XAV939 selectively inhibited β-catenin-mediated transcription and Testican-1-induced EMT signaling, leading to G1 arrest. Taken together, these data support the potential role of EMT in acquired resistance to HER2-directed treatment in HER2-positive gastric cancer, and provide insights into strategies for preventing and/or overcoming this resistance in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2030583095,"The discovery and characterization of blood-based disease biomarkers are clinically important because blood collection is easy and involves relatively little stress for the patient. However, blood generally reflects not only targeted diseases, but also the whole body status of patients. Thus, the selection of biomarkers may be difficult. In this study, we considered miRNAs as biomarker candidates for several reasons. First, since miRNAs were discovered relatively recently, they have not yet been tested extensively. Second, since the number of miRNAs is relatively limited, selection is expected to be easy. Third, since they are known to play critical roles in a wide range of biological processes, their expression may be disease specific. We applied a newly proposed method to select combinations of miRNAs that discriminate between healthy controls and each of 14 diseases that include 5 cancers. A new feature selection method is based on principal component analysis. Namely this method does not require knowledge of whether each sample was derived from a disease patient or a healthy control. Using this method, we found that hsa-miR-425, hsa-miR-15b, hsa-miR-185, hsa-miR-92a, hsa-miR-140-3p, hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-486-5p, hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-191, hsa-miR-106b, hsa-miR-19b, and hsa-miR-30d were potential biomarkers; combinations of 10 of these miRNAs allowed us to discriminate each disease included in this study from healthy controls. These 12 miRNAs are significantly up- or downregulated in most cancers and other diseases, albeit in a cancer- or disease-specific combinatory manner. Therefore, these 12 miRNAs were also previously reported to be cancer- and disease-related miRNAs. Many disease-specific KEGG pathways were also significantly enriched by target genes of up-/downregulated miRNAs within several combinations of 10 miRNAs among these 12 miRNAs. We also selected miRNAs that could discriminate one disease from another or from healthy controls. These miRNAs were found to be largely overlapped with miRNAs that discriminate each disease from healthy controls."
https://openalex.org/W2084054884,"Metastatic breast cancer cannot be treated successfully. Currently, the targeted therapies for metastatic disease are limited to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and hormone receptor antagonists. Understanding the mechanisms of breast cancer growth and metastasis is therefore crucial for the development of new intervention strategies. Here, we show that FER kinase (FER) controls migration and metastasis of invasive human breast cancer cell lines by regulating α6- and β1-integrin-dependent adhesion. Conversely, the overexpression of FER in non-metastatic breast cancer cells induces pro-invasive features. FER drives anoikis resistance, regulates tumour growth and is necessary for metastasis in a mouse model of human breast cancer. In human invasive breast cancer, high FER expression is an independent prognostic factor that correlates with high-grade basal/triple-negative tumours and worse overall survival, especially in lymph node-negative patients. These findings establish FER as a promising target for the prevention and inhibition of metastatic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2067549328,"The loss of function of the basolateral K channels in the distal nephron causes electrolyte imbalance. The aim of this study is to examine the role of Src family protein tyrosine kinase (SFK) in regulating K channels in the basolateral membrane of the mouse initial distal convoluted tubule (DCT1). Single-channel recordings confirmed that the 40-picosiemen (pS) K channel was the only type of K channel in the basolateral membrane of DCT1. The suppression of SFK reversibly inhibited the basolateral 40-pS K channel activity in cell-attached patches and decreased the Ba(2+)-sensitive whole-cell K currents in DCT1. Inhibition of SFK also shifted the K reversal potential from -65 to -43 mV, suggesting a role of SFK in determining the membrane potential in DCT1. Western blot analysis showed that KCNJ10 (Kir4.1), a key component of the basolateral 40-pS K channel in DCT1, was a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. LC/MS analysis further confirmed that SFK phosphorylated KCNJ10 at Tyr(8) and Tyr(9). The single-channel recording detected the activity of a 19-pS K channel in KCNJ10-transfected HEK293T cells and a 40-pS K channel in the cells transfected with KCNJ10+KCNJ16 (Kir.5.1) that form a heterotetramer in the basolateral membrane of the DCT. Mutation of Tyr(9) did not alter the channel conductance of the homotetramer and heterotetramer. However, it decreased the whole-cell K currents, the probability of finding K channels, and surface expression of KCNJ10 in comparison to WT KCNJ10. We conclude that SFK stimulates the basolateral K channel activity in DCT1, at least partially, by phosphorylating Tyr(9) on KCNJ10. We speculate that the modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of KCNJ10 should play a role in regulating membrane transport function in DCT1."
https://openalex.org/W2015949811,"Regulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) is crucial in normal synaptic function and neurological disease states. Although transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs) such as stargazin (γ-2) modulate the properties of calcium-impermeable AMPARs (CI-AMPARs) and promote their synaptic targeting, the TARP-specific rules governing CP-AMPAR synaptic trafficking remain unclear. We used RNA interference to manipulate AMPAR-subunit and TARP expression in γ-2-lacking stargazer cerebellar granule cells--the classic model of TARP deficiency. We found that TARP γ-7 selectively enhanced the synaptic expression of CP-AMPARs and suppressed CI-AMPARs, identifying a pivotal role of γ-7 in regulating the prevalence of CP-AMPARs. In the absence of associated TARPs, both CP-AMPARs and CI-AMPARs were able to localize to synapses and mediate transmission, although their properties were altered. Our results also establish that TARPed synaptic receptors in granule cells require both γ-2 and γ-7 and reveal an unexpected basis for the loss of AMPAR-mediated transmission in stargazer mice."
https://openalex.org/W2018408305,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded, noncoding RNAs that function as negative regulators of gene expression. They are transcribed from endogenous DNA and form hairpin structures (termed as pre-miRNAs) that are processed to form mature miRNAs. It remains largely unknown as to the molecular consequences of the natural genetic variation in pre-miRNAs. Here, we report that an A→G polymorphism (rs71428439) is located in Homo sapiens miR-149 stem-loop region. This polymorphism results in a change in the structure of the miR-149 precursor. Our results showed that the genotype distribution of this polymorphism in myocardial infarction cases was significantly different from that in the control subjects. We examined the biological significance of this polymorphism on the production of mature miR-149, and we observed that the G-allelic miR-149 precursor displayed a lower production of mature miR-149 compared with the A-allelic one. Further investigations disclosed that miR-149 could withstand mitochondrial fission and apoptosis through targeting the pro-apoptotic factor p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (Puma). Enforced expression of miR-149 promoted cell survival, whereas knockdown of miR-149 rendered cells to be sensitive to apoptotic stimulation. Intriguingly, the A to G variation led pre-miR-149 to elicit an attenuated effect on the inhibition of mitochondrial fission and apoptosis. Finally, this polymorphism exerts its influence on cardiac function in the mouse model of myocardial infarction. These data suggest that this polymorphism in the miR-149 precursor may result in important phenotypic traits of myocardial infarction. Our findings warrant further investigations on the relationship between miR-149 polymorphism and myocardial infarction."

Herein, we demonstrate that skeletal muscle mitochondria are indeed capable of lactate oxidation. In skeletal muscle, mitochondrial-associated LDH is located outside of the mitochondrial matrix. Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River and housed in a climate controlled environment with appropriate light:dark cycles. Rats were allowed to eat standard chow and drink water ad libitum. For experiments involving permeabilized fibers, rats were >110 days old and weighed 500–600 g at the time of sacrifice. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committees of St. Francis Xavier University and Dalhousie University and conformed to the standards of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. For experiments involving isolated mitochondria, rats were 6–10 weeks old at the time of sacrifice. Rats were sacrificed via an intraperitoneal injection of 250 mg/ml of sodium pentobarbital (Vetoquinol, QC; permeabilized fibers) or isofluorane/CO2 chamber (isolated mitochondria). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The stock concentration of l-lactate dehydrogenase (from rabbit muscle) used in the mitochondrial studies was 1850 units/ml in 75 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The following antibodies were used: anti-LDH (catalog number ab47010, Abcam); MitoProfile Total OXPHOS mixture (catalog number ab110411, Mitosciences); anti-Bcl-2 (catalog number 7382, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); Dylight549-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (catalog number 711-505-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories); Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (catalog number A11001, Invitrogen). Alexa Fluor® 680 goat anti-mouse IgG (catalog number A21057, Invitrogen); Alexa Fluor® 750 goat anti-rabbit IgG (catalog number A21039, Invitrogen). Immediately following the confirmed death of the rat, the hindlimb was dissected and the gastrocnemius was removed and placed in ice-cold relaxing buffer X, consisting of (in mm): 50 MES, 7.23 K2EGTA, 2.77 CaK2EGTA, 20 imidazole, 0.5 DTT, 20 taurine, 5.7 ATP, 14.3 PCr, and 6.56 MgCl2·6 H2O (pH 7.1, 290 mOsmol). Two fiber bundles from each red and white portion of the gastrocnemius were gently separated along the longitudinal axis with needle tipped forceps (FST, Inc.) in ice-cold buffer X under magnification (Discovery V8, Carl Zeiss). Fiber bundles were then transferred to separate vials containing saponin (50 μg/ml) dissolved in 1.5 ml of buffer X for 30 min at 4 °C and frequently inverted. Following permeabilization, each fiber bundle was transferred to a separate vial containing a wash solution, buffer Z, consisting of (in mm): 105 K-MES, 30 KCl, 10 KH2PO4, 5 MgCl2·6H2O, 5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.1. Fibers were kept in buffer Z for 20–40 min with frequent inversion until experimental testing. Similar procedures were performed for muscle extraction for isolated mitochondria, with the exception being that muscle was immediately placed in ice-cold isolation buffer (see “Mitochondrial Isolation” below). Additionally, liver was harvested in these rats, and placed directly in ice-cold mitochondrial isolation buffer. Skeletal muscle mitochondria were isolated as described previously (3.Yoshida Y. Holloway G.P. Ljubicic V. Hatta H. Spriet L.L. Hood D.A. Bonen A. Negligible direct lactate oxidation in subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar mitochondria obtained from red and white rat skeletal muscle.J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 1317-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, red gastrocnemius muscle was dissected away, and minced for 10 min on ice in isolation buffer consisting of (in mm): 50 Tris-HCl, 5 MgSO4·7 H2O, 5 EDTA, 100 KCl, 1.19 ATP, pH 7.4. Minced muscle was homogenized briefly with a Teflon pestle in a glass vial. Homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant, containing subsarcolemmal (SS) mitochondria, was removed and kept on ice. The pellet, containing intermyofibrillar mitochondria (IMF), was resuspended in isolation buffer without protease. We excluded protease in the isolation of IMF mitochondria, which has been the practice in previous studies, to address concerns about degradation of mitochondrial-bound LDH with protease treatment (6.Brooks G.A. Hashimoto T. Investigation of the lactate shuttle in skeletal muscle mitochondria.J. Physiol. 2007; 584: 705-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The resuspension was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min, after which, the supernatant was removed and discarded. The pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant, containing IMF mitochondria was removed, and kept on ice. Both suspensions of SS and IMF mitochondria were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, their pellets were resuspended in isolation buffer, and centrifuged once more at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting SS and IMF pellets were resuspended in MiR05 respiration assay buffer, consisting of (in mm): 0.5 EGTA, 10 KH2PO4, 3 MgCl2·6 H2O, 60 K-lactobionate, 20 HEPES, 110 sucrose, and 1 mg/ml of fatty acid free BSA, pH 7.1. All isolated mitochondrial suspensions were kept on ice until respirometric analysis. Isolated mitochondria were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer, consisting of (in mm): 50 Tris, 150 NaCl, 50 Na2HPO4, 1 Na3VO4, 1 NaF, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate. The lysis buffer also contained 1 μl of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, catalog number P8340). Samples were homogenized and incubated at 4 °C with constant agitation for 30 min, then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentration was determined in the supernatant of each sample with a modified Lowry method (Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay, catalog number 500-0116). Mitochondrial respiratory oxygen flux (JO2) was measured in high resolution using the Oxygraph-2k (OROBOROS Instruments, Innsbruck, AT). All mitochondrial samples were assessed in 2 ml of respiration assay buffer, consisting of buffer Z for the permeabilized fiber experiments, and MiR05 for experiments involving isolated mitochondria. Buffer Z was supplemented with 20 mm creatine to saturate the creatine kinase reaction (7.Kuznetsov A.V. Veksler V. Gellerich F.N. Saks V. Margreiter R. Kunz W.S.

The concentration of O2 in the experimental chambers was maintained between 100 and 300 μm for permeabilized fibers, and between 10 and 200 μm for experiments involving isolated mitochondria. All experiments were conducted at 37 °C. Instrumental background O2 consumption was corrected using equations determined under the same parameters used for experimental data collection. Four respirometric protocols, involving sequential addition of substrates and inhibitors and/or titration of substrates, were used: 1) 5 mm ADP, 4 mm malate, 5 mm lactate, 250 μm NAD+ (permeabilized fibers), 500 μm NAD+, 10 mm lactate (isolated mitochondria), 10 μm cytochrome c, 250 μm α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (CHC; permeabilized fibers only), 500 μm CHC, 1 mm CHC (isolated liver mitochondria), 10 mm glutamate (isolated mitochondria); 2) in permeabilized fibers only: 5 mm ADP, 4 mm malate, titration of pyruvate (50–1000 μm), 250 μm NAD+, 500 μm NAD+, 10 μm cytochrome c, 250 μm CHC, 500 μm CHC; 3) in permeabilized fibers only: 5 mm ADP, 4 mm malate, 500 μm NAD+, titration of lactate 0.5–15 mm, 500 μm CHC; 4) in permeabilized fibers: 5 mm ADP, 4 mm malate, 10 mm lactate, 1 mm NAD+, 9.25 units/ml of LDH, 10 μm cytochrome c, 5 μm CHC, 10 mm glutamate. For permeabilized fibers, JO2 was expressed as picomol O2 × s−1 × mg−1 tissue wet weight or as a percentage of glutamate-stimulated respiration. JO2 in isolated mitochondria was expressed as picomol O2 × s−1 × mg−1 of protein and presented as a percentage of glutamate-stimulated JO2 to better compare the two mitochondrial subpopulations. For the lactate titrations (Fig. 2), basal JO2 with ADP + malate + NAD+ was subtracted from each subsequent JO2 elicited by addition of lactate (i.e., net JO2). For tests involving protease treatment (FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8), 10 μm trypsin was added to the oxygraph chambers containing buffer at 37 °C for 15 min prior to substrate (ADP + malate). 20 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to both treatment and control chambers immediately after the 15-min typsin treatment.FIGURE 8Immunoblot for LDH and IMM protein complex II in permeabilized muscle fibers. Red gastrocnemius fibers permeabilized with 30 μg/ml of saponin and treated with 10 μm trypsin for 15 min revealed that LDH remains present even after trypsin treatment (lane 2).

Samples were homogenized in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5). Following protein quantification (DC Protein Assay, Bio-Rad, catalog number 500-0116), 100 μg of protein was separated in 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (catalog number IPFL00010 Immobilon® FL, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were stained with Ponceau red to assess loading; after they were rinsed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST; 20 mm Tris base, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6), the blots were blocked in 5% skim milk/TBST for 1 h. Blots were incubated with antibodies for LDH (catalog number ab47010, Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), and MitoProfile Total OXPHOS Human WB Antibody Mixture (catalog number ab110411, Abcam Inc.) overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation. Following 3 washes with TBST, immunoblots were incubated with either Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse IgG (catalog number A21057, Invitrogen) or Alexa Fluor 750 goat anti-rabbit IgG (catalog number A21039, Invitrogen) depending on the primary antibody used. The bands were detected with Odyssey version 3.0, and multiple exposures were generated to ensure the linearity of the fluorescent signal. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures were carried out to determine whether an interaction between the levels of variables exists. Additional within groups one-way analysis of variances with repeated measures (Bonferroni post hoc analyses) were performed to examine differences among fiber types or isolated mitochondrial subpopulations. The software package SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences 15.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical calculations. The α-level for statistical significance was set a priori at 0.05. Enzyme kinetic curves were fit to the Michaelis-Menten model (i.e. Y = Vmax × X/(Km + X), where X = [substrate], and Y = JO2) using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Before examining possible lactate oxidation in either the red gastrocnemius (RG) or white gastrocnemius (WG), respiration in the two muscle types was compared (Fig. 1A). Respiration in permeabilized red fibers was greater than white muscle fibers. This is in agreement with previous studies and is due to greater mitochondrial content in red muscle. Subsequent experiments were therefore conducted in RG fibers. Using RG presented an additional advantage of responding to exogenous cytochrome c, suggesting damage to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) of at least some fibers in the sample. The heterogeneous permeabilization pattern that we subsequently confirmed using confocal imaging would allow us to examine mitochondrial LDH localization in instances in which mitochondria appear to have lost the OMM. Contrary to many (e.g. (10.Cogswell A.M. Stevens R.J. Hood D.A. Properties of skeletal muscle mitochondria isolated from subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar regions.Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C383-C389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), but not all (11.Koves T.R. Noland R.C. Bates A.L. Henes S.T. Muoio D.M. Cortright R.N.

Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C1074-C1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) previous studies, we observed greater respiration in SS mitochondria compared with IMF mitochondria. This was likely due to the exclusion of protease in the isolation of IMF mitochondria, unlike other studies examining lactate oxidation in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria (3.Yoshida Y. Holloway G.P. Ljubicic V. Hatta H. Spriet L.L. Hood D.A. Bonen A. Negligible direct lactate oxidation in subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar mitochondria obtained from red and white rat skeletal muscle.J.

Physiol. 2002; 541: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As mentioned, protease was excluded to address concerns about potential degradation of mitochondrial-bound LDH with protease treatment (6.Brooks G.A. Hashimoto T. Investigation of the lactate shuttle in skeletal muscle mitochondria.J. Physiol. 2007; 584: 705-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To better compare the two subpopulations in the present study, respiration is expressed as a percentage of glutamate-stimulated JO2 (glutamate added at the end of the protocol; Fig. 3). To test whether mitochondria in situ are capable of oxidizing lactate, 5 mm lactate was added to both permeabilized red and white fibers atop 5 mm ADP + 4 mm malate. Addition of lactate resulted in no change to JO2 in either RG or WG (Fig. 1). As hypothesized, addition of 500 μm NAD+ resulted in a significant increase in JO2 in both RG and WG (p < 0.001), suggesting that extramitochondrial NAD+ is a requisite cofactor for the mitochondrial LDH reaction in both muscle fiber types. This increase in NAD+-dependent JO2 represented a 74.6 and 94.7% increase in RG and WG, respectively, above JO2 prior to NAD+ addition. To further determine whether this lactate oxidation occurred outside of the mitochondrial matrix, 500 μm CHC, an inhibitor of mitochondrial pyruvate transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (13.Halestrap A.P. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier. Kinetics and specificity for substrates and inhibitors.Biochem. J. 1975; 148: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), was added. As expected, the NAD+-induced increase in JO2 was abolished to pre-NAD+ rates by CHC in RG and WG (p < 0.001; Fig. 1A). However, 500 μm CHC is high enough to raise concerns about whether MCT1, the lactate transporter, may have been inhibited as well. Therefore, a 100-fold lower concentration (5 μm) was used in another set of experiments (Fig. 1B). Similar, robust inhibition of lactate + NAD+-supported JO2 was observed in RG and WG (p < 0.001). This implies that lactate was first oxidized to pyruvate, and then transported across the IMM for subsequent oxidation. As a positive control, the lactate protocol was repeated in permeabilized fibers, with the exception that pyruvate was added in place of lactate (data not shown). As with the lactate experiment (Fig. 1), addition of CHC inhibited respiration to pre-pyruvate rates. This further supports that pyruvate, but not lactate per se, enters the mitochondrial matrix. To determine the sensitivity to lactate (Km,app), and capacity (Vmax) of lactate-supported JO2 in RG versus WG permeabilized fibers, lactate was titrated (0.5–15 mm) atop 5 mm ADP + 4 mm malate + 500 μm NAD+. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, respiration tended to be greater in RG mitochondria for a given concentration of lactate. Indeed, the Km,app for lactate (Fig. 2B) was significantly lower, and the Vmax for JO2 supported by lactate (Fig. 2C) significantly greater (p < 0.05) in RG versus WG. Thus, RG exhibited both greater sensitivity to lactate, as well as a greater capacity for lactate-stimulated respiration. To further explore which subpopulations of skeletal muscle mitochondria may be responsible for lactate-stimulated JO2, the lactate protocol was replicated in SS and IMF mitochondria isolated from rat RG. During ADP + malate-supported respiration in IMF mitochondria, addition of either lactate or lactate + NAD+ did not increase JO2 (Fig. 3). However, SS mitochondria recapitulated the results of permeabilized fiber experiments. More specifically, whereas addition of lactate did not increase JO2 in SS mitochondria, subsequent addition of NAD+ significantly increased JO2 (p < 0.001; Fig. 3). Moreover, as in the permeabilized fiber experiments, CHC effectively abolished JO2 to pre-NAD+ rates. The results of the functional assays are consistent with the notion of close spatial positioning of LDH with mitochondria. To further investigate the potential colocalization between LDH and mitochondria, immunofluorescent labeling of LDH and mitochondrial membrane proteins were performed in RG fibers. The RG fibers used for immunostaining were prepared in parallel with the functional assay to ensure identical conditions for both experiments. In intact fibers, scanning laser confocal microscopic imaging of antibodies specific for IMM proteins (mixture of antibodies against proteins of the respiratory chain, Mitosciences®) and LDH confirmed mitochondrial LDH colocalization (Figs. 4A and 5A, a–c). In an attempt to discern whether LDH was associated with the OMM or IMM, we studied with immunofluorescence the relative localization of LDH with respect to Bcl-2, which is bound to the OMM. In intact fibers, LDH colocalized strongly with Bcl-2 (Figs. 4B and 6A, a–c). Colocalization of LDH with Bcl-2 was largely preserved upon membrane permeabilization (Fig. 6B, a–c). There were rarely cells in which the Bcl-2 signal was lost (presumably due to compromised OMM integrity), but the LDH signal remained (Fig. 6C, a–c). This phenomenon is illustrated by the orange pseudo-color of the overlay image in Fig. 6C, c, a result of the markedly reduced Bcl-2 (green) signal. These observations suggest an association between LDH and mitochondria that is independent of the OMM. We observed essentially three phases of intactness among the muscle fibers permeabilized with 50 μg/ml of saponin: 1) completely intact mitochondria (Fig. 6B, a–c); 2) a transitional phase, in which Bcl-2 is gone, but LDH remains colocalized to the IMM (orange signal; Fig. 6C, a–c); and 3) loss of LDH, with IMM still present (Fig. 5B). Indeed, in Fig. 5B, a–c, there are regions where the LDH signal was diminished, but the IMM signal remained. This pattern is consistent with the idea that LDH binding sites are on the outer side of the IMM. This was further confirmed by restoration of the LDH signal when the exogenous enzyme was added to the permeabilized fibers (Fig. 5C, a–c). Furthermore, in fibers with damaged OMM, the LDH signal was markedly lower in some of the fibers in samples treated with trypsin (Fig. 5D, a–c), suggesting that LDH in skeletal muscle mito"

The abundance of cysteines in this isoform is particularly fascinating, as hVDAC-1 cysteines have no associated functional role. We report a detailed biophysical examination of a Cys-less mutant of hVDAC-2, and its behavioral comparison with the wild type protein. Our findings suggest that cysteine mutation results in the formation of a better barrel at the expense of weakened protein-lipid interactions. The wild type protein displays stronger lipid association, despite being less structured. A reversal in behavior of both proteins is observed in the case of chemical denaturation, with the Cys-less mutant exhibiting lowered unfolding free energies. In bicellar systems comprising 14-C phosphocholines, we observe that protein-lipid interactions are weakened in both constructs, resulting in barrel structure destabilization. Our biochemical and biophysical studies together reveal key structural roles for the cysteine residues. We find that minor conformational variations in local residues are sufficient to define the membrane protein dynamics in hVDAC-2. Such subtle sequence variations contribute to differential stability of VDACs and may have implications in their in vivo regulation and recycling."
https://openalex.org/W2008354511,"Secondary adaptation to aquatic life occurred independently in several amniote lineages, including reptiles during the Mesozoic and mammals during the Cenozoic. These evolutionary shifts to aquatic environments imply major morphological modifications, especially of the feeding apparatus. Mesozoic (250-65 Myr) marine reptiles, such as ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurid squamates, crocodiles, and turtles, exhibit a wide range of adaptations to aquatic feeding and a broad overlap of their tooth morphospaces with those of Cenozoic marine mammals. However, despite these multiple feeding behavior convergences, suction feeding, though being a common feeding strategy in aquatic vertebrates and in marine mammals in particular, has been extremely rarely reported for Mesozoic marine reptiles.A relative of fossil protostegid and dermochelyoid sea turtles, Ocepechelon bouyai gen. et sp. nov. is a new giant chelonioid from the Late Maastrichtian (67 Myr) of Morocco exhibiting remarkable adaptations to marine life (among others, very dorsally and posteriorly located nostrils). The 70-cm-long skull of Ocepechelon not only makes it one of the largest marine turtles ever described, but also deviates significantly from typical turtle cranial morphology. It shares unique convergences with both syngnathid fishes (unique long tubular bony snout ending in a rounded and anteriorly directed mouth) and beaked whales (large size and elongated edentulous jaws). This striking anatomy suggests extreme adaptation for suction feeding unmatched among known turtles.The feeding apparatus of Ocepechelon, a bony pipette-like snout, is unique among tetrapods. This new taxon exemplifies the successful systematic and ecological diversification of chelonioid turtles during the Late Cretaceous. This new evidence for a unique trophic specialization in turtles, along with the abundant marine vertebrate faunas associated to Ocepechelon in the Late Maastrichtian phosphatic beds of Morocco, further supports the hypothesis that marine life was, at least locally, very diversified just prior to the Cretaceous/Palaeogene (K/Pg) biotic crisis."
https://openalex.org/W2017673888,"The mechanisms that coordinate the final mitotic divisions of terminally differentiated bone marrow (BM) erythroid cells with components of their structural and functional maturation program remain largely undefined. We previously identified phenotypes resembling those found in early-stage myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including ineffective erythropoiesis, morphologic dysplasia and BM hyper-cellularity, in a knock-in mouse model in which cyclin E mutations were introduced at its two Cdc4 phosphodegrons (CPDs) to ablate Fbw7-dependent ubiquitination and degradation. Here, we have examined the physiologic consequences of cyclin E dysregulation in BM erythroid cells during terminal maturation in vivo. We found that cyclin E protein levels in BM erythroid cells are dynamically regulated in a CPD-dependent manner and that disruption of Fbw7-dependent cyclin E regulation impairs terminal erythroid cell maturation at a discrete stage before enucleation. At this stage of erythroid cell maturation, CPD phosphorylation of cyclin E regulates both cell-cycle arrest and survival. We also found that normal regulation of cyclin E restrains mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and expression of genes that promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism during terminal erythroid maturation. In the setting of dysregulated cyclin E expression, p53 is activated in BM erythroid cells as part of a DNA damage response-type pathway, which mitigates ineffective erythropoiesis, in contrast to the role of p53 induction in other models of dyserythropoiesis. Finally, cyclin E dysregulation and ROS accumulation induce histone H3 lysine 9 hyper-methylation and disrupt components of the normal terminal erythroid maturation gene expression program. Thus, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway control of G1-to-S-phase progression is intrinsically linked to regulation of metabolism and gene expression in terminally differentiating BM erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W2108005267,"Many tumours harbour mutations in the p53 tumour-suppressor gene that result in the expression of a mutant p53 protein. This mutant p53 protein has, in most cases, lost wild-type transcriptional activity and can also acquire novel functions in promoting invasion and metastasis. One of the mechanisms underlying these novel functions involves the ability of the mutant p53 to interfere with other transcription factors, including the p53 family protein TAp63. To investigate whether simultaneous depletion of both p53 and TAp63 can recapitulate the effect of mutant p53 expression in vivo, we used a mouse model of pancreatic cancer in which the expression of mutant p53 resulted in the rapid appearance of primary tumours and metastases. As shown previously, loss of one allele of wild-type (WT) p53 accelerated tumour development. A change of one WT p53 allele into mutant p53 did not further accelerate tumour development, but did promote the formation of metastasis. By contrast, loss of TAp63 did not significantly accelerate tumour development or metastasis. However, simultaneous depletion of p53 and TAp63 led to both rapid tumour development and metastatic potential, although the incidence of metastases remained lower than that seen in mutant p53-expressing tumours. TAp63/p53-null cells derived from these mice also showed an enhanced ability to scatter and invade in tissue culture as was observed in mutant p53 cells. These data suggest that depletion of TAp63 in a p53-null tumour can promote metastasis and recapitulate—to some extent—the consequences of mutant p53 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2018084039,"Melanoma cells facilitate endothelial gap formation, the first step during tumor transendothelial migration, which is mediated by both adhesion and endogenously produced chemokines (in particular, interleukin-8 (IL-8)). Tetraspanins are localized to the cell surface in cancer and participate in various functions including invasion of tissues mediated by secretion of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases. However, little is known about the role of CD82 tetraspanins in malignant melanomas during cancer cell invasion. In this study, we investigated the functional importance of CD82 expression in melanoma-mediated gap formation by using cDNAs to induce CD82 expression in highly invasive melanoma cell lines. Results showed that CD82 expression inhibited melanoma cell-induced gap formation, melanoma cell extravasation in vitro and subsequent lung metastasis development in vivo. Mechanistic studies showed that inducible expression of CD82 in highly metastatic melanoma cells significantly increased p21 expression upon binding of Duffy antigen receptor group (DARC), inducing tumor cell senescence and interrupting IL-8-mediated vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin disassembly. Taken together, these studies provide a rationale for using drug therapies that restore CD82 expression and inhibit IL-8 production to inhibit late-stage melanoma cell extravasation and subsequent metastasis development."
https://openalex.org/W1997725315,"PRDM proteins are tissue-specific transcription factors often deregulated in diseases, particularly in cancer where different members have been found to act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. PRDM5 is a poorly characterized member of the PRDM family for which several studies have reported a high frequency of promoter hypermethylation in cancer types of gastrointestinal origin. We report here the characterization of Prdm5 knockout mice in the context of intestinal carcinogenesis. We demonstrate that loss of Prdm5 increases the number of adenomas throughout the murine small intestine on an ApcMin background. By using the genome-wide ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by DNA sequencing) and transcriptome analyses we identify loci encoding proteins involved in metabolic processes as prominent PRDM5 targets and characterize monoacylglycerol lipase (Mgll) as a direct PRDM5 target in human colon cancer cells and in Prdm5 mutant mouse intestines. Moreover, we report the downregulation of PRDM5 protein expression in human colon neoplastic lesions. In summary, our data provide the first causal link between Prdm5 loss and intestinal carcinogenesis, and uncover an extensive and novel PRDM5 target repertoire likely facilitating the tumor-suppressive functions of PRDM5."
https://openalex.org/W2045543081,"Heterotrimeric G proteins contain a switch III motif that regulates enzyme function. Structural and biochemical studies now identify a similar switch III loop in a nonheterotrimeric G-protein chaperone that explains the debilitating effects of mutations linked to methylmalonic aciduria. Fidelity during cofactor assembly is essential for the proper functioning of metalloenzymes and is ensured by specific chaperones. MeaB, a G-protein chaperone for the coenzyme B12-dependent radical enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM), uses the energy of GTP binding, hydrolysis or both to regulate cofactor loading into MCM, protect MCM from inactivation and rescue MCM that is inactivated during turnover. Typically, G proteins signal to client proteins using the conformationally mobile switch I and II loops. Crystallographic snapshots of MeaB reported herein reveal a new switch III element that has substantial conformational plasticity. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the switch III motif is critical for bidirectional signal transmission of the GTPase-activating protein activity of MCM and the chaperone functions of MeaB in the MeaB–MCM complex. Mutations in the switch III loop identified in patients corrupt this interprotein communication and lead to methylmalonic aciduria, an inborn error of metabolism."

In this study, we investigated the inhibitory mechanism of ApoLp on S. aureus hemolysin gene expression. ApoLp bound to lipoteichoic acids (LTA), an S. aureus cell surface component. The addition of purified LTA to liquid medium abolished the inhibitory effect of ApoLp against S. aureus hemolysin production. In an S. aureus knockdown mutant of ltaS encoding LTA synthetase, the inhibitory effects of ApoLp on saeQ expression and hemolysin production were attenuated. Furthermore, the addition of anti-LTA monoclonal antibody to liquid medium decreased the expression of S. aureus saeQ and hemolysin genes. In S. aureus strains expressing SaeS mutant proteins with a shortened extracellular domain, ApoLp did not decrease saeQ expression. These findings suggest that ApoLp binds to LTA on the S. aureus cell surface and inhibits S. aureus hemolysin gene expression via a two-component regulatory system, SaeRS."
https://openalex.org/W2136288698,"Heterozygous germline mutations in PHOX2B, a transcriptional regulator of sympathetic neuronal differentiation, predispose to diseases of the sympathetic nervous system, including neuroblastoma and congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). Although the PHOX2B variants in CCHS largely involve expansions of the second polyalanine repeat within the C-terminus of the protein, those associated with neuroblastic tumors are nearly always frameshift and truncation mutations. To test the hypothesis that the neuroblastoma-associated variants exert their effects through loss or gain of protein–protein interactions, we performed a large-scale yeast two-hybrid screen using both wild-type (WT) and six different mutant PHOX2B proteins against over 10 000 human genes. The neuronal calcium sensor protein HPCAL1 (VILIP-3) exhibited strong binding to WT PHOX2B and a CCHS-associated polyalanine expansion mutant but only weakly or not at all to neuroblastoma-associated frameshift and truncation variants. We demonstrate that both WT PHOX2B and the neuroblastoma-associated R100L missense and the CCHS-associated alanine expansion variants induce nuclear translocation of HPCAL1 in a Ca2+-independent manner, while the neuroblastoma-associated 676delG frameshift and K155X truncation mutants impair subcellular localization of HPCAL1, causing it to remain in the cytoplasm. HPCAL1 did not appreciably influence the ability of WT PHOX2B to transactivate the DBH promoter, nor did it alter the decreased transactivation potential of PHOX2B variants in 293T cells. Abrogation of the PHOX2B–HPCAL1 interaction by shRNA knockdown of HPCAL1 in neuroblastoma cells expressing PHOX2B led to impaired neurite outgrowth with transcriptional profiles indicative of inhibited sympathetic neuronal differentiation. Our results suggest that certain PHOX2B variants associated with neuroblastoma pathogenesis, because of their inability to bind to key interacting proteins such as HPCAL1, may predispose to this malignancy by impeding the differentiation of immature sympathetic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2043662498,"TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in cancer. In breast cancer, it is mutated in about 40% of primary clinical tumors and is associated with poor survival. The mammotrophic hormone, prolactin (PRL), and/or its receptor are also expressed in many breast cancers, and accumulating epidemiologic data link PRL to breast cancer development and progression. Like TP53 mutations, evidence for PRL activity is evident across several molecular cancer subtypes, and elevated PRL expression and loss of p53 have been observed in some of the same clinical tumors. In order to examine the interaction of these factors, we used genetically modified mouse models of mammary-specific p53 loss and local overexpression of PRL. We demonstrated that mammary PRL decreased the latency of tumors in the absence of p53, and increased the proportion of triple-negative claudin-low carcinomas, which display similarities to human clinical metaplastic carcinomas. Moreover, PRL/p53(-/-) carcinomas displayed higher rates of proliferation and more aggressive behavior. Transcripts associated with cell cycle progression, invasion and stromal reactivity were differentially expressed in carcinomas that developed in the presence of elevated PRL. PRL/p53(-/-) carcinomas also exhibited selectively altered expression of activating protein-1 components, including higher levels of c-Jun and FosL1, which can drive transcription of many of these genes and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The ability of PRL to promote claudin-low carcinomas demonstrates that PRL can influence this subset of triple-negative breast cancers, which may have been obscured by the relative infrequency of this cancer subtype. Our findings suggest novel therapeutic approaches, and provide a preclinical model to develop possible agents."

The accuracy of our method is over 99.5% in 10-fold cross-validation. Based on the annotation data in Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), we studied the coding capacity of all 1744 ORFs which lack experimental results and suggested that the overall number of chromosomal ORFs encoding proteins in yeast should be 6091 by removing 488 spurious ORFs. The importance of the present work lies in at least two aspects. First, cross-validation and retrospective examination showed the fidelity of our method in recognizing ORFs that likely encode proteins. Second, we have provided a web service that can be accessed at http://cobi.uestc.edu.cn/services/yeast/, which enables the prediction of protein-coding ORFs of the genus Saccharomyces with a high accuracy."

G-protein-coupled activation of human neutrophils by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF) is mediated not only by FPR1 but also by the lower affinity FPR2, also known as FPRL1, LXA4R, and ALX (17Ye R.D.

The current thinking is that phosphorylation of FPR not only reduces its ability to bind fMLF and G-proteins (28Key T.A. Foutz T.D. Gurevich V.V. Sklar L.A. Prossnitz E.R.

Maestas D.C. Cimino D.F. Prossnitz E.R. Regulation of N-formyl peptide receptor signaling and trafficking by individual carboxyl-terminal serine and threonine residues.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 5418-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is likely that all of the individual steps that modulate activity are linked sequentially and spatially and that the entire system is required to control FPR accessibility to G-proteins in a process that may be important in controlling the inflammatory milieu. Receptor phosphorylation appears to play a role in most of these sensitivity modulation processes (27Fu H. Karlsson J. Bylund J. Movitz C. Karlsson A. Dahlgren C. Ligand recognition and activation of formyl peptide receptors in neutrophils.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 79: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). FPR phosphorylation has been implicated as the controlling process for desensitization of FPR action in neutrophils (30Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. Didsbury J.R. Snyderman R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In visual rhodopsin, C-tail phosphorylation is believed to be essential for visual response termination (31Arshavsky V.Y. Rhodopsin phosphorylation. From terminating single photon responses to photoreceptor dark adaptation.Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 124-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), by controlling rhodopsin interactions with arrestin, and similarly phosphorylation in the C-terminal tail of the β-adrenergic receptor is required for down-regulation and desensitization (32Nobles K.N.

Distinct phosphorylation sites on the β2-adrenergic receptor establish a barcode that encodes differential functions of β-arrestin.Sci. Signal. 2011; 4: ra51Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). We described two monoclonal antibodies in 2007 that recognized two different regions of the C-terminal tail of FPR1 and FPR2 and showed that these mAbs could differentiate between different states of FPR1 in intact neutrophils, both by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. We also showed that the sensitivity of one of the antibodies, NFPRb (also known as NFPR2), to the fMLF-induced activation of recombinant FPR1 expressed in CHO cells was probably due to phosphorylation of its C-terminal tail (33Riesselman M. Miettinen H.M. Gripentrog J.M. Lord C.I. Mumey B. Dratz E.A. Stie J. Taylor R.M. Jesaitis A.J. C-terminal tail phosphorylation of N-formyl peptide receptor. Differential recognition of two neutrophil chemoattractant receptors by monoclonal antibodies NFPR1 and NFPR2.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2520-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the phosphorylation state of FPR1 in whole cell dodecyl maltoside extracts of control and cytochalasin B-exposed neutrophils, stimulated with fMLF at different concentrations. We show that mAb NFPRb, immunoblotting to a Mr 50,000–70,000 molecular species by SDS-PAGE, depends inversely and saturably on prior exposure of neutrophils to fMLF. In contrast, NFPRa recognizes two species consistent with FPR1 and FPR2 that appear nearly invariant after exposure to fMLF. We also partially immunopurified both FPR1 and FPR2 from whole cell detergent extracts as well as from cell membranes of unstimulated (U) and fMLF + cytochalasin B (CB)-treated (S) cells and analyzed their deglycosylated forms by trypsin digestion followed by mass spectrometry. Our results suggest that phosphorylation occurs individually at seven different sites of the FPR1 C terminus only in the S samples without evidence of any phosphorylation of FPR2. These observations demonstrate the potential for analyzing receptor regulation, association, modification, and potentially, the interplay between the two chemoattractant receptors FPR1 and FPR2 in their native stimulated and unstimulated cellular environments.

All other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell resuspension and stimulation buffers were as follows: DPBS(+) (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, Na2HPO4, supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% dextrose) and RPMI without phenyl red made as directed by the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich). Relaxation buffer (Relax) contained 10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.4; Relax(+) contained 10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, fresh 1 mm PMSF, 1:1000 diluted Sigma P8340 protease inhibitor mixture, and 1:1000 Sigma phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 2 and 3, pH 7.4. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contained 137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4. Cell lysis buffer was as follows: Relax(+) plus 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, 2.5 μm latrunculin, 1 unit/ml benzoase, with or without the nonionic detergent, 2% DDM.

Special FPR electrotransfer buffer contained 0.19 m sodium/glycine, 20% methanol, 25 mm Tris-base, 0.02% SDS, pH 8.5. Human neutrophils were prepared as described by Henson and Oades (34Henson P.M. Oades Z.G. Stimulation of human neutrophils by soluble and insoluble immunoglobulin aggregates.J. Clin. Invest. 1975; 56: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and by the low LPS dextran method described by DeLeo et al. (35DeLeo F.R. Renee J. McCormick S. Nakamura M. Apicella M.

The latter cells were used for preparation of unstimulated cells because they were unprimed and minimally perturbed. Maximal stimulation was carried out on the former primed cell preparation essentially as described previously by Parkos et al. (37Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. Purified cytochrome b from human granulocyte plasma membrane is composed of two polypeptides with relative molecular weights of 91,000 and 22,000.J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, after resuspension in DPBS(+) containing +10 μm CB, 80 μg/ml catalase, and 50 units/ml superoxide dismutase, a 7-min preincubation at 37 °C was followed by the addition of 1 μm fMLF and continued incubation for 10 min with brief gentle mixing. The stimulated cells were then diluted 5-fold with ice-cold DPBS(+) and placed on ice followed by resuspension, maintaining the cells at 0–4 °C in homogenization buffer for preparation of membranes or in Relax(+) buffer for direct solubilization. For analysis of cellular FPR1 phosphorylation by immunoblotting with NFPRb, neutrophils were resuspended in RPMI at a density of 1.1 × 107/ml and divided into 500-μl aliquots into individual 1.5–2-ml polyethylene tubes. These suspensions were pre-exposed to vehicle or cytochalasin B for 10 min and mixed by agitation occasionally, after which 1500 volume of the appropriately diluted stock fMLF/vehicle was added to each tube. After 10 min, the reaction was quenched on ice, after the addition of 1 ml of iced RPMI. Cells were then pelleted at 500 × g for 2 min at 2 °C and carefully aspirated, discarding the supernatants. 300 μl of DDM lysis buffer (plus PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitors) was then added and mixed by vortexing to remove the pellets from the side of the tubes. The tubes were capped and tumbled for 45 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged in a table top centrifuge for 30 min at 17,000 rpm at 4 °C. 200 μl of the supernatant was placed into a new tube, avoiding the pellet. FPR1 and FPR2 in the pellet as measured by NFPRa binding was negligible. This sample was then reduced and alkylated as follows: 1) the addition of 200 μl of 18 mm DTT (final concentration 9 mm DTT) in TS buffer, mixed and incubated at 60 °C for 5 min and then cooled for 5 min at room temperature; 2) the addition of 100 μl of 300 mm N-ethylmaleimide (final concentration 60 mm NEM) in TS buffer, mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min; 3) the addition of 500 μl of 2-fold concentrated SB followed by mixing, incubation at room temperature for 10 min, and then freezing at −20 °C. After 24–72 h, the sample was thawed, and 40 μl/lane containing ∼1.5 × 105 cell equivalents/lane was loaded and then separated on a 9% polyacrylamide gel containing 28 lanes. The gels were run as described previously (33Riesselman M. Miettinen H.M. Gripentrog J.M. Lord C.I. Mumey B. Dratz E.A. Stie J. Taylor R.M. Jesaitis A.J. C-terminal tail phosphorylation of N-formyl peptide receptor. Differential recognition of two neutrophil chemoattractant receptors by monoclonal antibodies NFPR1 and NFPR2.J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2520-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and then electroeluted onto Immobilon PVDF membranes in special FPR electrotransfer buffer (see above). The transfer was carried out at 100 V to 0.2 V-h at a maximum of 0.5 A for ∼2 h. The Immobilon was then washed in milliQ deionized water for 15 min and then dried overnight between two sheets of Whatman filter paper. The next day, the PVDF was re-wet for 15 s in 100% methanol (HPLC grade) and then rinsed twice in deionized water, followed by soaking in PBS for ∼2 min. The blot was blocked by soaking in undiluted Odyssey blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h on a gently oscillating rocker. The blot was subsequently transferred into the NFPRa or NFPRb primary antibody, diluted to 1.2 and 3.0 μg/ml, respectively, in Odyssey blocking buffer with 0.2% Tween nonionic detergent, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with rocking. The blot was then removed from the primary mAb and washed five times for 10 min each in PBS plus 0.1% Tween with rocking. Incubation of the washed blot in secondary mAb was accomplished at room temperature with gentle rocking in Odyssey blocking buffer containing 0.2% Tween, 0.01% SDS, with goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) DyLight 800-conjugated antibody at a dilution of 1:10,000. The incubation was shielded from light by Al foil. This incubation was followed by five washes of 10-min duration in PBS plus 0.1% Tween while shielded from ambient light. The blots were scanned in a LI-COR Odyssey infrared fluorescence digital scanner using the 780-nm excitation while wet and subsequently stored dry between two sheets of Whatman filter paper, protected from light. Scans were quantified in two ways. For routine assays, 8-bit tif images from Odyssey scans of wet transfers were saved to files and analyzed using GE Life Sciences ImageQuant by inverting images, rotating 90°, and analyzing individual bands in a 28-lane gel as a single virtual lane in ImageQuant, allowing up and down quantitation for any chosen molecular weight range for all conditions of the experiment. The integrated signals minus background and corresponding ratios of background-subtracted signals for FPR1, measured with NFPRb and NFPRa, were calculated and plotted, after normalizing for maximum range, or against the control as indicated. The normalized data were then analyzed by GraphPad Prism version 3.03 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) using a one- or two-site nonlinear regression fit and plotted as sigmoidal inhibition curves on a logarithmic abscissa, as shown, for example, in Fig. 2. Pellets containing up to 1–3 × 109 S or U neutrophils, prepared as above, were resuspended in at least 5–15 ml of lysis buffer without detergent, followed by 1:1 dilution in the same buffer with 2% DDM, and then tumbled at room temperature for 45 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman Ti-60 rotor at 22 °C. The soluble extract or supernatant was used for further purification of FPR except for two 50-μl aliquots used for quantitation. To clear the extract of Sepharose-binding components and flavocytochrome b, needed for other purposes, the extract was mixed with a 500-μl wet-packed bead volume of CNBr-Sepharose covalently coupled to mAb CS9 that recognizes p22phox (36Taylor R.M.

Any IgG1 mAb, however, would achieve the clearing, and other mAbs can be substituted. The suspension was tumbled in a rotator (∼4 rpm) at room temperature for 40 min and then poured into a plastic fritted column, drained, and washed"
https://openalex.org/W2057274347,"In this study we describe a previously unreported function for NFκB2, an NFκB family transcription factor, in antiviral immunity. NFκB2 is induced in response to poly(I:C), a mimic of viral dsRNA. Poly(I:C), acting via TLR3, induces p52-dependent transactivation of a reporter gene in a manner that requires the kinase activity of IκB kinase ε (IKKε) and the transactivating potential of RelA/p65. We identify a novel NFκB2 binding site in the promoter of the transcription factor Sp1 that is required for Sp1 gene transcription activated by poly(I:C). We show that Sp1 is required for IL-15 induction by both poly(I:C) and respiratory syncytial virus, a response that also requires NFκB2 and IKKε. Our study identifies NFκB2 as a target for IKKε in antiviral immunity and describes, for the first time, a role for NFκB2 in the regulation of gene expression in response to viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1997762873,"The genes encoding a family of proteins termed proline-rich γ-carboxyglutamic acid (PRRG) proteins were identified and characterized more than a decade ago, but their functions remain unknown. These novel membrane proteins have an extracellular γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) protein domain and cytosolic WW binding motifs. We screened WW domain arrays for cytosolic binding partners for PRRG4 and identified novel protein-protein interactions for the protein. We also uncovered a new WW binding motif in PRRG4 that is essential for these newly found protein-protein interactions. Several of the PRRG-interacting proteins we identified are essential for a variety of physiologic processes. Our findings indicate possible novel and previously unidentified functions for PRRG proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1982048708,"CD20 is a B cell surface marker that is expressed in various stages in B lymphocytes and certain lymphomas. Clinical administration of CD20 antibody, such as rituximab, is used widely to treat human B-cell lymphomas and other diseases. However, CD20 antibody failed to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus). The reason for the failure is currently unknown. Type I interferons (IFN) are a major component for the host innate immunity, and a key pathogenic factor in lupus. We found that CD20 antibody potentiated human B cells for its production of IFNs in vitro. This function was specific to CD20-expressing cells and the potentiation function seems to be instant. In addition, ectopic expression of CD20 in non-B-lymphocytes increased the IFN promoter reporter activities. Because IFNs are a key pathogenic factor in lupus, our data suggest that, in the presence of virus infection, the CD20-antibody-mediated enhancement of IFN production might be related to its failure in lupus treatments. This work may provide new insights for CD20-Ab therapeutic applications."
