https://openalex.org/W1993933078,"Programming the behaviour of molecules in time and space is a big challenge in nanotechnology. Traditional robots can be given a memory in which to store internal representations of their goals and environment, and coordinate their response. Individual molecules are limited in their ability to store information and programs, but robotic behaviour can still be realized by exploiting the interaction of simple single-molecule robots with a precisely defined environment. This has now been demonstrated with spider-shaped DNA 'walkers', which sense and modify tracks of substrate molecules laid out on a two-dimensional DNA origami landscape. The robots carry out actions such as 'start', 'follow', 'turn', and 'stop' programmed into the DNA landscape, with more complex robotic behaviour expected once secondary levels of control can be introduced. Traditional robots need to store internal representations of their goals and environment, and to coordinate sensing and the movement of components required in response. Individual molecules are limited in their ability to store complex information, but robotic behaviour can still be realized — as has now been shown with DNA walkers, which can carry out a sequence of actions such as 'start', 'follow', 'turn' and 'stop' that are programmed into the DNA landscape on which the walkers move. Traditional robots1 rely for their function on computing, to store internal representations of their goals and environment and to coordinate sensing and any actuation of components required in response. Moving robotics to the single-molecule level is possible in principle, but requires facing the limited ability of individual molecules to store complex information and programs. One strategy to overcome this problem is to use systems that can obtain complex behaviour from the interaction of simple robots with their environment2,3,4. A first step in this direction was the development of DNA walkers5, which have developed from being non-autonomous6,7 to being capable of directed but brief motion on one-dimensional tracks8,9,10,11. Here we demonstrate that previously developed random walkers12—so-called molecular spiders that comprise a streptavidin molecule as an inert ‘body’ and three deoxyribozymes as catalytic ‘legs’—show elementary robotic behaviour when interacting with a precisely defined environment. Single-molecule microscopy observations confirm that such walkers achieve directional movement by sensing and modifying tracks of substrate molecules laid out on a two-dimensional DNA origami landscape13. When using appropriately designed DNA origami, the molecular spiders autonomously carry out sequences of actions such as ‘start’, ‘follow’, ‘turn’ and ‘stop’. We anticipate that this strategy will result in more complex robotic behaviour at the molecular level if additional control mechanisms are incorporated. One example might be interactions between multiple molecular robots leading to collective behaviour14,15; another might be the ability to read and transform secondary cues on the DNA origami landscape as a means of implementing Turing-universal algorithmic behaviour2,16,17."
https://openalex.org/W2032813700,"Our ability to synthesize nanometre-scale chemical species, such as nanoparticles with desired shapes and compositions, offers the exciting prospect of generating new functional materials and devices by combining them in a controlled fashion into larger structures. Self-assembly can achieve this task efficiently, but may be subject to thermodynamic and kinetic limitations: reactants, intermediates and products may collide with each other throughout the assembly time course to produce non-target species instead of target species. An alternative approach to nanoscale assembly uses information-containing molecules such as DNA to control interactions and thereby minimize unwanted cross-talk between different components. In principle, this method should allow the stepwise and programmed construction of target products by linking individually selected nanoscale components-much as an automobile is built on an assembly line. Here we demonstrate that a nanoscale assembly line can be realized by the judicious combination of three known DNA-based modules: a DNA origami tile that provides a framework and track for the assembly process, cassettes containing three independently controlled two-state DNA machines that serve as programmable cargo-donating devices and are attached in series to the tile, and a DNA walker that can move on the track from device to device and collect cargo. As the walker traverses the pathway prescribed by the origami tile track, it sequentially encounters the three DNA devices, each of which can be independently switched between an 'ON' state, allowing its cargo to be transferred to the walker, and an 'OFF' state, in which no transfer occurs. We use three different types of gold nanoparticle species as cargo and show that the experimental system does indeed allow the controlled fabrication of the eight different products that can be obtained with three two-state devices."

https://openalex.org/W2003258297,"Many proteins form fibrillar structures at high concentrations, but spider silk proteins, with highly repetitive segments flanked by non-repetitive (NR) terminal domains, behave differently. They are remarkably soluble when stored at high concentration yet can convert to extremely sturdy fibres on demand. The molecular mechanism that makes this possible is not yet clear, but two structural studies in this issue provide new clues. Askarieh et al. present the 1.7 Å X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of a dragline spidroin from the nursery web spider Euprosthenops australis. The structure shows how this highly conserved domain can regulate silk assembly by preventing premature aggregation of spidroins and triggering polymerization as the pH falls along the silk extrusion duct. Hagn et al. determined the solution structure of the C-terminal NR domain of the dragline silk protein fibroin 3 from the common orb-weaver Araneus diadematus. They observe a conformational switch, activated by chemical or mechanical stimuli, between storage and assembly forms of the protein. Spider silk proteins are remarkably soluble when stored at high concentration and yet can be converted to extremely sturdy fibres, through unknown molecular mechanisms. Here, the structure of the evolutionarily conserved carboxy-terminal domain of a silk protein is presented. The results provide evidence that the structural state of this domain is essential for controlled switching between the storage and assembly forms of silk proteins. Such molecular switches might see application in the design of versatile fibrous materials. A huge variety of proteins are able to form fibrillar structures1, especially at high protein concentrations. Hence, it is surprising that spider silk proteins can be stored in a soluble form at high concentrations and transformed into extremely stable fibres on demand2,3. Silk proteins are reminiscent of amphiphilic block copolymers containing stretches of polyalanine and glycine-rich polar elements forming a repetitive core flanked by highly conserved non-repetitive amino-terminal4,5 and carboxy-terminal6 domains. The N-terminal domain comprises a secretion signal, but further functions remain unassigned. The C-terminal domain was implicated in the control of solubility and fibre formation7 initiated by changes in ionic composition8,9 and mechanical stimuli known to align the repetitive sequence elements and promote β-sheet formation10,11,12,13,14. However, despite recent structural data15, little is known about this remarkable behaviour in molecular detail. Here we present the solution structure of the C-terminal domain of a spider dragline silk protein and provide evidence that the structural state of this domain is essential for controlled switching between the storage and assembly forms of silk proteins. In addition, the C-terminal domain also has a role in the alignment of secondary structural features formed by the repetitive elements in the backbone of spider silk proteins, which is known to be important for the mechanical properties of the fibre."

https://openalex.org/W2152459216,"Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is a quantum interference phenomenon that enables the transmission of a laser pulse through an optically dense medium to be manipulated by means of a control beam. Mücke et al. have scaled the technique down to just a single atom interacting with single photons, able to act as a quantum-optical transistor with the ability to coherently control the transmission of light through a cavity. This may lead to novel quantum applications, such as dynamic control of the photon statistics of propagating light fields in computers and other devices. Electromagnetically induced transparency enables the transmission of a laser pulse through an optically dense medium to be manipulated using a control beam. Here this technique is scaled down to a single atom, which acts as a quantum-optical transistor with the ability to coherently control the transmission of light through a cavity. This may lead to novel quantum applications, such as dynamic control of the photon statistics of propagating light fields. Optical nonlinearities offer unique possibilities for the control of light with light. A prominent example is electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), where the transmission of a probe beam through an optically dense medium is manipulated by means of a control beam1,2,3. Scaling such experiments into the quantum domain with one (or just a few) particles of light and matter will allow for the implementation of quantum computing protocols with atoms and photons4,5,6,7, or the realization of strongly interacting photon gases exhibiting quantum phase transitions of light8,9. Reaching these aims is challenging and requires an enhanced matter–light interaction, as provided by cavity quantum electrodynamics10,11,12. Here we demonstrate EIT with a single atom quasi-permanently trapped inside a high-finesse optical cavity. The atom acts as a quantum-optical transistor with the ability to coherently control13 the transmission of light through the cavity. We investigate the scaling of EIT when the atom number is increased one-by-one. The measured spectra are in excellent agreement with a theoretical model. Merging EIT with cavity quantum electrodynamics and single quanta of matter is likely to become the cornerstone for novel applications, such as dynamic control of the photon statistics of propagating light fields14 or the engineering of Fock state superpositions of flying light pulses15."

https://openalex.org/W2021317870,"Neurotransmitter:Na(+) symporters (NSS) remove neurotransmitters from the synapse in a reuptake process that is driven by the Na(+) gradient. Drugs that interfere with this reuptake mechanism, such as cocaine and antidepressants, profoundly influence behaviour and mood. To probe the nature of the conformational changes that are associated with substrate binding and transport, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence imaging assay and combined it with functional and computational studies of the prokaryotic NSS homologue LeuT. Here we show molecular details of the modulation of intracellular gating of LeuT by substrates and inhibitors, as well as by mutations that alter binding, transport or both. Our direct observations of single-molecule transitions, reflecting structural dynamics of the intracellular region of the transporter that might be masked by ensemble averaging or suppressed under crystallographic conditions, are interpreted in the context of an allosteric mechanism that couples ion and substrate binding to transport."
https://openalex.org/W2033013069,"The main reason why tumours are not controlled by the immune system is that, unlike pathogens, they do not express potent tumour rejection antigens (TRAs). Tumour vaccination aims at stimulating a systemic immune response targeted to, mostly weak, antigens expressed in the disseminated tumour lesions. Main challenges in developing effective vaccination protocols are the identification of potent and broadly expressed TRAs and effective adjuvants to stimulate a robust and durable immune response. Here we describe an alternative approach in which the expression of new, and thereby potent, antigens are induced in tumour cells by inhibiting nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay (NMD). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of NMD in tumour cells led to the expression of new antigenic determinants and their immune-mediated rejection. In subcutaneous and metastatic tumour models, tumour-targeted delivery of NMD factor-specific siRNAs conjugated to oligonucleotide aptamer ligands led to significant inhibition of tumour growth that was superior to that of vaccination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-expressing irradiated tumour cells, and could be further enhanced by co-stimulation. Tumour-targeted NMD inhibition forms the basis of a simple, broadly useful, and clinically feasible approach to enhance the antigenicity of disseminated tumours leading to their immune recognition and rejection. The cell-free chemically synthesized oligonucleotide backbone of aptamer-siRNAs reduces the risk of immunogenicity and enhances the feasibility of generating reagents suitable for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2025688309,"Background Many drug delivery systems are based on the ability of certain macrocyclic compounds – such as cyclodextrins (CDs) – to act as molecular containers for pharmaceutical agents in water. Indeed β-CD and its derivatives have been widely used in the formulation of hydrophobic pharmaceuticals despite their poor abilities to act as a molecular container (e.g., weak binding (Ka<104 M−1) and their challenges toward chemical functionalization. Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]) are a class of molecular containers that bind to a variety of cationic and neutral species with high affinity (Ka>104 M−1) and therefore show great promise as a drug delivery system. Methodology In this study we investigated the toxicology, uptake, and bioactivity of two cucurbit[n]urils (CB[5] and CB[7]) and three CB[n]-type containers (Pentamer 1, methyl hexamer 2, and phenyl hexamer 3). All five containers demonstrated high cell tolerance at concentrations of up to 1 mM in cell lines originating from kidney, liver or blood tissue using assays for metabolic activity and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the CB[7] molecular container was efficiently internalized by macrophages indicating their potential for the intracellular delivery of drugs. Bioactivity assays showed that the first-line tuberculosis drug, ethambutol, was as efficient in treating mycobacteria infected macrophages when loaded into CB[7] as when given in the unbound form. This result suggests that CB[7]-bound drug molecules can be released from the container to find their intracellular target. Conclusion Our study reveals very low toxicity of five members of the cucurbit[n]uril family of nanocontainers. It demonstrates the uptake of containers by cells and intracellular release of container-loaded drugs. These results provide initial proof-of-concept towards the use of CB[n] molecular containers as an advanced drug delivery system."
https://openalex.org/W2042148950,"The intestinal epithelium is a barrier that composes one of the most immunologically active surfaces of the body due to constant exposure to microorganisms as well as an infinite diversity of food antigens. Disruption of intestinal barrier function and aberrant mucosal immune activation have been implicated in a variety of diseases within and outside of the gastrointestinal tract. With this model in mind, recent studies have shown a link between diet, composition of intestinal microbiota, and type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. In the BioBreeding rat model of type 1 diabetes, comparison of the intestinal microbial composition of diabetes prone and diabetes resistant animals found Lactobacillus species were negatively correlated with type 1 diabetes development. Two species, Lactobacillus johnsonii and L. reuteri, were isolated from diabetes resistant rats. In this study diabetes prone rats were administered pure cultures of L. johnsonii or L. reuteri isolated from diabetes resistant rats to determine the effect on type 1 diabetes development.Findings Results Rats administered L. johnsonii, but not L. reuteri, post-weaning developed type 1 diabetes at a protracted rate. Analysis of the intestinal ileum showed administration of L. johnsonii induced changes in the native microbiota, host mucosal proteins, and host oxidative stress response. A decreased oxidative intestinal environment was evidenced by decreased expression of several oxidative response proteins in the intestinal mucosa (Gpx1, GR, Cat). In L. johnsonii fed animals low levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFNgamma were correlated with low levels of iNOS and high levels of Cox2. The administration of L. johnsonii also resulted in higher levels of the tight junction protein claudin.It was determined that the administration of L. johnsonii isolated from BioBreeding diabetes resistant rats delays or inhibits the onset of type 1 diabetes in BioBreeding diabetes prone rats. Taken collectively, these data suggest that the gut and the gut microbiota are potential agents of influence in type 1 diabetes development. These data also support therapeutic efforts that seek to modify gut microbiota as a means to modulate development of this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2160958037,"White dwarfs are the most common endpoint of stellar evolution, so they convey important information about the structure and evolution of a galaxy — its age for instance. NGC 6791 is a metal-rich open cluster that is so close to us that it can be imaged down to the very faint luminosities of white dwarfs. Its age determined from turn-off ages of its main sequence stars is estimated at ∼8 billion years, but its 'white dwarf luminosity' age, reflecting termination of the white dwarf cooling sequence, is ∼6 billion years. This apparent inconsistency casts doubts on the reliability of white dwarfs as galactic chronometers. One possible explanation is that as white dwarfs cool, 22Ne produced as helium burns sinks into the star's interior, causing crystallization and phase separation of 12C and 16O, which delays cooling. García-Berro et al. use numerical modelling of the entire white dwarf evolution process to show that physical separation does occur in the core of NGC 6791. This confirms 8 billion years as the cluster's age, and restores the reputation of white dwarfs as reliable chronometers. NGC 6791 is a well studied open cluster that is so close to us that it can be imaged down to very faint luminosities. Two different ages have been proposed for this cluster, one based on the white dwarf luminosity function and one derived from its main-sequence stars. The discrepancy in age is now resolved by the finding that, as theoretically anticipated, physical separation processes occur in the core of white dwarfs. NGC 6791 is a well studied open cluster1 that it is so close to us that can be imaged down to very faint luminosities2. The main-sequence turn-off age (∼8 Gyr) and the age derived from the termination of the white dwarf cooling sequence (∼6 Gyr) are very different. One possible explanation is that as white dwarfs cool, one of the ashes of helium burning, 22Ne, sinks in the deep interior of these stars3,4,5. At lower temperatures, white dwarfs are expected to crystallize and phase separation of the main constituents of the core of a typical white dwarf (12C and 16O) is expected to occur6,7. This sequence of events is expected to introduce long delays in the cooling times8,9, but has not hitherto been proven. Here we report that, as theoretically anticipated5,6, physical separation processes occur in the cores of white dwarfs, resolving the age discrepancy for NGC 6791."

https://openalex.org/W1966758310,"Background Cells of the oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage play a vital role in the production and maintenance of myelin, a multilamellar membrane which allows for saltatory conduction along axons. These cells may provide immense therapeutic potential for lost sensory and motor function in demyelinating conditions, such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and transverse myelitis. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling OL differentiation are largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are considered the “micromanagers” of gene expression with suggestive roles in cellular differentiation and maintenance. Although unique patterns of miRNA expression in various cell lineages have been characterized, this is the first report documenting their expression during oligodendrocyte maturation from human embryonic stem (hES) cells. Here, we performed a global miRNA analysis to reveal and identify characteristic patterns in the multiple stages leading to OL maturation from hES cells including those targeting factors involved in myelin production. Methodology/Principal Findings We isolated cells from 8 stages of OL differentiation. Total RNA was subjected to miRNA profiling and validations preformed using real-time qRT-PCR. A comparison of miRNAs from our cultured OLs and OL progenitors showed significant similarities with published results from equivalent cells found in the rat and mouse central nervous system. Principal component analysis revealed four main clusters of miRNA expression corresponding to early, mid, and late progenitors, and mature OLs. These results were supported by correlation analyses between adjacent stages. Interestingly, the highest differentially-expressed miRNAs demonstrated a similar pattern of expression throughout all stages of differentiation, suggesting that they potentially regulate a common target or set of targets in this process. The predicted targets of these miRNAs include those with known or suspected roles in oligodendrocyte development and myelination including C11Orf9, CLDN11, MYTL1, MBOP, MPZL2, and DDR1. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate miRNA profiles during distinct stages in oligodendroglial differentiation that may provide key markers of OL maturation. Our results reveal pronounced trends in miRNA expression and their potential mRNA target interactions that could provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanisms of differentiation."

Here, we assessed the possibility that angiotensin-1 (AT1R) or angiotensin-2 (AT2R) receptors on the nuclear envelope mediate effects on cardiomyocyte gene expression. Immunoblots of nucleus-enriched fractions from isolated cardiomyocytes indicated the presence of AT1R and AT2R proteins that copurified with the nuclear membrane marker nucleoporin-62 and histone-3, but not markers of plasma (calpactin-I), Golgi (GRP-78), or endoplasmic reticulum (GM130) membranes. Confocal microscopy revealed AT1R and AT2R proteins on nuclear membranes. Microinjected Ang-II preferentially bound to nuclear sites of isolated cardiomyocytes. AT1R and AT2R ligands enhanced de novo RNA synthesis in isolated cardiomyocyte nuclei incubated with [α-32P]UTP (e.g. 36.0 ± 6.0 cpm/ng of DNA control versus 246.4 ± 15.4 cpm/ng of DNA Ang-II, 390.1 ± 15.5 cpm/ng of DNA L-162313 (AT1), 180.9 ± 7.2 cpm/ng of DNA CGP42112A (AT2), p < 0.001). Ang-II application to cardiomyocyte nuclei enhanced NFκB mRNA expression, a response that was suppressed by co-administration of AT1R (valsartan) and/or AT2R (PD123177) blockers. Dose-response experiments with Ang-II applied to purified cardiomyocyte nuclei versus intact cardiomyocytes showed greater increases in NFκB mRNA levels at saturating concentrations with ∼2-fold greater affinity upon nuclear application, suggesting preferential nuclear signaling. AT1R, but not AT2R, stimulation increased [Ca2+] in isolated cardiomyocyte nuclei. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor blockade by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate prevented AT1R-mediated Ca2+ release and attenuated AT1R-mediated transcription initiation responses.

Despite the fundamental role of Ang-II in the regulation of heart function and gene expression, direct demonstrations of functional ATRs inside cardiac cells are lacking. Accordingly, the current study investigated the subcellular distribution of type 1 and 2 ATRs (AT1R and AT2R, respectively) in native ventricular cardiomyocytes, with particular attention to the nuclear envelope, and assessed evidence for coupling of such intracellular receptors to Ang-II-mediated transcriptional responses. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: AT1R and AT2R from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) and Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel); calpactin-I, GM130, and GRP-78 from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ); histone from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); and nucleoporin 62 from ABCAM (Cambridge, MA) (see supplemental Table S1 for more details). All secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Candesartan was kindly provided by AstraZeneca (Mississauga, Ontario) and valsartan by Novartis (Dorval, Quebec). The primers for quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were purchased from SuperArray (Frederick, MD)/Invitrogen. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were of molecular biology grade and obtained from Fisher or Sigma. Male Wistar adult rats (200–300 g) were anesthetized with a combination of ketamine/xylazine (10 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneally) and treated with heparin (1.0 units/kg of body weight). All animal handling procedures were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of the Montreal Heart Institute and the procedures complied with guidelines established in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication 65-23, revised 1996). Hearts were exposed via sternotomy, rapidly excised, and immersed in ice-cold Tyrode solution containing: 140 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm dextrose, 5 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH. Left ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated using a Langendorff perfusion system. The hearts were cannulated via the ascending aorta and in situ retrograde perfusion of the coronary arteries was started with 200 μm Ca2+ in modified Tyrode solution (140 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm HEPES, and 10 mm dextrose adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH). After perfusion for 3 min at 6 ml/min, the hearts were perfused with calcium-free Tyrode solution for an additional 5 min. Subsequently, hearts were enzymatically digested by perfusion with Ca2+-free Tyrode solution containing 0.5 mg/ml of type II collagenase for ∼45 min. When the heart was softened, the left ventricle was minced into small pieces in Kraftbruhe medium (20 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 40 mm mannitol, 70 mm l-glutamic acid, 10 mm β-hydroxybutyric acid, 20 mm taurine, 10 mm EGTA, and 0.1% albumin, pH 7.5, NaOH). To promote cell dissociation, the solution and tissue fragments were resuspended with a transfer pipette and the suspension was filtered through a 200-μm nylon mesh. Cardiomyocytes were separated from non-cardiomyocyte cells by sedimentation (3 × 200 g, 3 min), the supernatant was discarded or used for fibroblast isolation, and the final cardiomyocyte pellet was resuspended in Joklik's minimal essential medium (25 mm NaHCO2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dl-carnitine, 1 mm CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH). All solutions were constantly aerated with 5% CO2, 95% O2, and solutions and cells were kept at 37 °C throughout the isolation process. Ca2+ tolerant, rod-shaped ventricular cardiomyocytes (75–90% of all cells) were used on the day of isolation or snap frozen at −80 °C for subsequent biochemical studies. Nuclei from total cardiac tissue were isolated in a similar general fashion, details are provided in supplemental data. Cardiomyocytes, isolated as described above, were washed 4 times with phosphate buffer before the isolation of myocardial nuclei. Cells were suspended in a hypo-osmotic buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were sedimented at 1000 × g for 10 min and then resuspended in 20 ml of hypo-osmotic buffer and sonicated for 90 s in a Branson 3200 sonifier. Triton X-100 was added to the sonicated preparation to a final concentration of 0.1% and then the preparation was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions was kept as a control for biochemical analysis. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of MC buffer (2.2 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl). This suspension was transferred to high resistance centrifugation tubes underlaid with 2.5 ml of MC buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet containing the nuclear fraction was resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Na-HEPES, 25% (volume/volume) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml of leupeptin, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, with a final pH of 7.4 (NaOH) or 1× transcription buffer (see below), and either used freshly or aliquoted, snap frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Membrane proteins were separated from cytoplasmic proteins by centrifugation at 100,000 × g (Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor) for 60 min. The membrane protein containing pellets were re-suspended in extraction buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml of pepstatin, supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay using a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Wilmington, DE). The purity of isolated cardiomyocytes was assessed by Western blot, using protein extracts prepared from cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and rat brain homogenates. For the isolation of fibroblasts, the supernatant obtained from the cardiomyocyte isolation was centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and plated on 58-cm2 dishes. Four hours later, the medium was changed and adherent cells were washed free of debris and non-attached cells. Smooth muscle and endothelial cells were obtained by a previously described method (13.Battle T. Arnal J.F. Challah M. Michel J.B. Tissue Cell. 1994; 26: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The rat brain homogenate protein fraction was a gift from Dr. Ling Xiao. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% (w/v) acrylamide running gels with 4% (w/v) acrylamide stacking gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 300 mA and 4 °C for 60 min in a transfer buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris base, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) ethanol. Membranes were blocked for 120 min with a solution of 5% skimmed milk powder (w/v) and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS at ambient temperature. Following blocking, membranes were incubated with the primary antibody (supplemental Table S1) overnight at 4 °C with continuous mixing. The following day, membranes were washed (4 × 12 min) with a solution containing 0.5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS, then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (60 min at room temperature). Membranes were thoroughly washed with PBS containing Tween 20 (4 × 12 min) and immunoreactive bands were revealed using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Reagent in conjunction with Bio-Max MR film (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Preliminary experiments were performed to establish exposure times that avoided film saturation and permitted quantification. To ensure equal protein loading, blots were stripped and stained using Ponceau S (0.5% Ponceau S, 1% glacial acetic acid, in deionized water). Immunoblots were scanned (1200 dpi) and band intensities quantified with Quantity One 1D analysis software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Freshly isolated cardiomyocytes were plated on 18-mm laminin (10 μg/ml)-coated coverslips for 60 min (37 °C, 95% O2, 5% CO2), fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized with blocking buffer comprising 2% normal donkey serum and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 60 min. After extensive washing to remove the excess serum, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 1% normal donkey serum and 0.05% Triton X-100. Coverslips were then rinsed several times with PBS and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with secondary antibody (Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody or Alexa 555-conjugated anti-mouse antibody diluted in 1% normal donkey serum and 0.05% Triton X-100). After a final wash with PBS, coverslips were mounted and fixed on glass slides with a drop of a mixture containing 0.1% diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane (DABCO)/glycerol. Fluorescence images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Composite images were created using Zeiss LSM510 software. For every secondary antibody, control experiments were performed omitting the primary antibody to confirm the specificity of the primary antibody. Nuclei were visualized using Hoechst 33342 or DRAQ5 nucleic acid stain. Image stacks were digitally deconvolved (0.01% threshold, lowest background and real signal/noise values) for 25 iterations to reduce out-of-focus light using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation algorithm and the appropriate experimentally determined point spread function with Huygens Professional software (version 3.1.0p1, Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, The Netherlands). Files were stored in ICS format and exported to PowerPoint (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Transcription initiation assays were performed using freshly isolated cardiomyocyte nuclei as previously described (14.Boivin B. Chevalier D. Villeneuve L.R. Rousseau E. Allen B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29153-29163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture of nuclei (treated with ligand where indicated), 1× transcription buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 unit/μl of RNase inhibitor, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) and [α-32P]UTP were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. CTP and GTP were omitted to prevent chain elongation. Following treatment with DNase (10 units/μl), nuclei were solubilized (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS), aliquots transferred onto Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada), washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid, and air dried. 32P incorporation was measured by Cerenkov counting in a β-counter. The DNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically and 32P incorporation is expressed as dpm/ng of DNA. Total RNA was extracted from cardiomyocyte nuclei using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) after homogenization with a motor-driven mixer. The concentration, quality, and purity of total RNA were determined using a BioAnalyzer (Genome Innovation Center, Montreal, Quebec). Total RNA was treated with DNase I (10 units for 15 min at 37 °C) to remove potential contamination by genomic DNA. cDNA templates for PCR amplification were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with a reverse transcriptase kit (SuperArray). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using SuperArray SYBR Green PCR kits and a Stratagene MX3000P qPCR system. Quantitative measurements were performed in triplicate and normalized to the average of three housekeeping internal controls (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, β2-macroglobin, and heat shock protein 90-kDa α, class B member 1). All reactions included 2 μl of cDNA and 0.5 μm primers. Standard curves were made from 10-fold serial dilutions of cDNA pools containing high concentrations of the gene of interest. Data were collected and analyzed using MX3000P software. Relative gene expression was calculated using the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method (15.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121148) Google Scholar). The sequences of primers used for qPCR are shown in supplemental Table S2. Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) was measured in isolated nuclei with the ratiometric calcium indicator Fura-2/AM (Sigma). Fura-2/AM was prepared daily as a 5 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. Right after the isolation, freshly isolated cardiomyocyte nuclei were resuspended in 0.5 ml of loading buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm K2HPO4, and 4 mm MgCl2. Fura-2/AM was added to the suspension of isolated nuclei for a final concentration of 7.5 μm and incubated on ice for 45 min. After an initial loading period, nuclei were washed of extracellular Fura-2/AM by centrifugation (2700 × g for 5 min, 4 °C) to remove non-incorporated Fura-2/AM and were then added with 1000 μl of loading buffer containing 800 nm CaCl2 onto the fluorodish. Ang-II, the AT1 agonist L162313, the AT2 agonist CGP42112A, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) were added, directly in the bath, close to a single nucleus, pre-treated or free of selective blockers (candesartan, PD123177, or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB)) to produce a final concentration of 10 μm. A microspectrofluorimeter (IonOptix, Milton, MA) was used for fluorescence measurements. Excitation wavelengths were 340 and 380 nm. Fluorescence emission was detected at 509 nm and expressed as the ratio of the two excitation wavelengths (F340/F380). The amplitudes of [Ca2+] responses were calculated by subtraction of the baseline F340/F380 ratio from peak values. Ca2+ concentrations were determined by calibrating the fluorescent signal by sequential addition of 9 μm ionomycin plus 1 mm CaCl2 to obtain the maximal fluorescence ratio (Rmax) and 4 mm EGTA to obtain the minimum fluorescence ratio (Rmin). Autofluorescence was determined by subtracting fluorescence from non-loaded nuclei and from the fluorescence produced by Fura-2-loaded nuclei. Cardiomyocytes were lysed by sonication in ice-cold 1 m acetic acid containing a protease/inhibitor mixture (Sigma S8820). The lysate was sedimented at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was dried in a vacufuge, followed by reconstitution in 1% acetic acid. The samples were applied to a conditioned DSC-18 column (Supelco), washed, and eluted with methanol. The eluted samples were dried and reconstituted in PBS for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Peninsula Labs). Ang-II was measured by quantitative competitive ELISA, using a specific anti-Ang-II antibody (Peninsula Labs), which was previously validated by high-performance liquid chromatography chip/mass spectrometric analysis (7.Singh V.P. Le B. Bhat V.B. Baker K.M. Kumar R. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 293: H939-H948Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). ELISA was performed on anti-Ang-II antibody-coated 96-well dishes. Competitive binding of synthetic biotinylated Ang-II, in the presence of the extracted peptide, was detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. A standard curve, generated from binding of a constant amount of biotinylated Ang-II with increasing concentrations of non-biotinylated synthetic Ang-II, was used to calculate the concentration of the peptide in the sample. The concentration of Ang-II in the cell lysates is expressed as femtomoles per milligram of protein. Components of the Ang-II biosynthetic pathway (angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin converting enzyme, and cathepsin) were quantified in cardiomyocyte lysates by qRT-PCR, as described above. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Analysis of variance with Tukey's post-hoc test was used for statistical comparison. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To examine the intracellular localization of AT1 and AT2 receptors, we isolated membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear fractions from isolated cardiac myocytes and from whole adult rat hearts. In initial studies, we characterized nuclear AT1 and AT2 receptors from intact cardiac tissue preparations. However, to be sure that biochemical results applied specifically to cardiomyocytes, we developed a nucleus-enriched preparation from isolated cardiomyocytes. All results shown in this paper were obtained from cardiomyocyte nuclei, whereas the results from cardiac tissue preparations are provided under supplemental data. The specificity of the isolated cardiomyocyte preparation was characterized by immunoblot with antibodies to various tissue-selective protein markers and cell populations (supplemental Fig. S1A). Isolated cardiomyocytes showed strong immunoreactive signals for myosin heavy chains, and no signals for Van Willebrand factor, neuron-specific enolase, discoidin domain receptor 2, or α-smooth muscle actin, which were found in the expected non-cardiomyocyte samples. Cellular fractionations were validated by Western blots for calpactin-I (cell membrane, 38 kDa), GRP-78 (endoplasmic reticulum, 78 kDa), Nup62 (nuclear pore central plug, 62 kDa), histone-3 (cell nuclei, 17 kDa), and GM130 (Golgi cisternae, 130 kDa), respectively (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 2A). Both AT1R (∼43 kDa) and AT2R (∼47 kDa) immunoreactivity was detected in the membrane or crude cell fraction A, as were calpactin I, GRP-78, and GM130. After further purification steps, the final nuclear fraction or fraction D was enriched in nucleoporin 62 (Nup62), histone-3, AT1R, and AT2R immunoreactivity. In contrast, fraction D was significantly depleted of calpactin-I, GRP-78, and GM130 immunoreactivity. Both N (Alomone) and C (Santa Cruz) terminal antibodies recognized AT1R and AT2R in the nuclear fraction (D); results shown are with the Santa Cruz antibody. Fig. 1B shows mean intensities of the various bands in cytosolic (fraction B) and nuclear (fraction D) fractions as a ratio of calpactin-I immunoreactivity in the membrane (fraction A), and demonstrates a substantial reduction in non-nuclear markers (GRP-78 and GM130) and increase in nuclear markers (Nup62 and histone-3), along with AT1R/AT2R, in nuclear-enriched preparations. The morphological properties of rat cardiomyocyte nuclei were analyzed as shown in Fig. 1C, and similar to those of nuclei obtained from cardiac tissue (supplemental Fig. S2C). Phase-contrast microscopic imaging (lower panel) reveals the integrity of the nuclei, with an intact nuclear envelope surrounding each nucleus. The freshly isolated nuclei were stained by DNA interactive agents DRAQ5 (Fig. 1C) or Hoechst 33342 dye (supplemental Fig. S2C). Finally, very high concentrations of DNA were found in the isolated nuclei (e.g. nuclear 909 ± 46 μg/ml, versus cytoplasmic supernatant 114 ± 17 μg/ml, p < 0.001, n = 8/group; Fig. 1D). The data in Fig. 1 confirm that both AT1R and AT2R are present in cardiomyocyte nuclei. To further investigate the subcellular localization of ATRs, we used confocal immunofluorescence microscopy with deconvolution to image isolated adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes decorated with antibodies against AT1R and AT2R, as illustrated in Fig. 2. AT1R and AT2R antibodies revealed a striated pattern consistent with the presence at the T-tubular network (Fig. 2, Aa and Ba). Immunofluorescence was also observed around the nucleus. Fig. 2, Ab and Bb, show the same cardiomyocytes stained for Nup62. Fig. 2, Ac and Bc, indicate extensive colocalization, more clearly evident in the higher magnification images in the insets. Phase-contrast reference images of the same cells are shown in Fig. 2, Ad and Bd. Similar results to those shown in Fig. 2 were obtained in all 40 cardiac cells from 10 rats examined for AT1R and all 30 cells from 10 rats studied for AT2R. No signal was observed in cells where the primary antibodies were omitted. Fig. 3 shows in vitro fluorescence imaging of intracellular Ang-II distribution after extracellular administration of Ang-II labeled with FITC to freshly isolated cardiomyocytes. High resolution images were then acquired by confocal microscopy at 5-min intervals. A 60-min time course confirmed the trafficking of Ang-II inside the cell, without any clear specificity for the nucleus. FITC-labeled Ang-II trafficking was significantly changed by the AT1R antagonist valsartan (10 μm), indicating that binding to cell membrane AT1R receptors is important for Ang-II internalization (Fig. 3B). (For corresponding dark-field images, see supplemental Fig. S3.) The absence of nuclear Ang-II in Fig. 3A argues against endocytosis as the mechanism for ATR localization and suggest that ATRs in the nuclear membrane are most likely a result of intracellular synthesis and trafficking. We then microinjected fluorescently labeled Ang-II into the cytoplasm of single cardiomyocytes to analyze the intracellular distribution of Ang-II (Eppendorf Femtojet; 1 nm Ang-II in 50 to 75 fl per cell), as shown in Fig. 4A. Although FITC-Ang-II rapidly diffused throughout the cytoplasm, the fluorescence was enriched or sequestered in the perinuclear region of injected cells 10–20 s after microinjection. The fluorescence decreased rapidly after 20 s but a clear signal at the nucleus (colocalization with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) remained at 30 s and disappeared within 30 s thereafter. At no time was fluorescence detected in cells neighboring the microinjected cell, suggesting that the distribution observed in injected cells was due to intracellula"
https://openalex.org/W1987811475,"Background The opioid system is involved in reward and pain mechanisms and consists in mammals of four receptors and several peptides. The peptides are derived from four prepropeptide genes, PENK, PDYN, PNOC and POMC, encoding enkephalins, dynorphins, orphanin/nociceptin and beta-endorphin, respectively. Previously we have described how two rounds of genome doubling (2R) before the origin of jawed vertebrates formed the receptor family. Methodology/Principal Findings Opioid peptide gene family members were investigated using a combination of sequence-based phylogeny and chromosomal locations of the peptide genes in various vertebrates. Several adjacent gene families were investigated similarly. The results show that the ancestral peptide gene gave rise to two additional copies in the genome doublings. The fourth member was generated by a local gene duplication, as the genes encoding POMC and PNOC are located on the same chromosome in the chicken genome and all three teleost genomes that we have studied. A translocation has disrupted this synteny in mammals. The PDYN gene seems to have been lost in chicken, but not in zebra finch. Duplicates of some peptide genes have arisen in the teleost fishes. Within the prepropeptide precursors, peptides have been lost or gained in different lineages. Conclusions/Significance The ancestral peptide and receptor genes were located on the same chromosome and were thus duplicated concomitantly. However, subsequently genetic linkage has been lost. In conclusion, the system of opioid peptides and receptors was largely formed by the genome doublings that took place early in vertebrate evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1997009285,"Background The world is currently confronting the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Influenza vaccination is an effective preventive measure, but the unique epidemiological features of swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) (pH1N1) introduce uncertainty as to the best strategy for prioritization of vaccine allocation. We sought to determine optimal prioritization of vaccine distribution among different age and risk groups within the Canadian population, to minimize influenza-attributable morbidity and mortality. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a deterministic, age-structured compartmental model of influenza transmission, with key parameter values estimated from data collected during the initial phase of the epidemic in Ontario, Canada. We examined the effect of different vaccination strategies on attack rates, hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality. In all scenarios, prioritization of high-risk individuals (those with underlying chronic conditions and pregnant women), regardless of age, markedly decreased the frequency of severe outcomes. When individuals with underlying medical conditions were not prioritized and an age group-based approach was used, preferential vaccination of age groups at increased risk of severe outcomes following infection generally resulted in decreased mortality compared to targeting vaccine to age groups with higher transmission, at a cost of higher population-level attack rates. All simulations were sensitive to the timing of the epidemic peak in relation to vaccine availability, with vaccination having the greatest impact when it was implemented well in advance of the epidemic peak. Conclusions/Significance Our model simulations suggest that vaccine should be allocated to high-risk groups, regardless of age, followed by age groups at increased risk of severe outcomes. Vaccination may significantly reduce influenza-attributable morbidity and mortality, but the benefits are dependent on epidemic dynamics, time for program roll-out, and vaccine uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2082615163,"Background The regenerative capacity of the skin, including the continuous replacement of exfoliated cells and healing of injuries relies on the epidermal stem cells and their immediate cell descendants. The relative contribution of the hair follicle stem cells and the interfollicular stem cells to dermal wound healing is an area of active investigation. Recent studies have revealed that the small GTPase Rac1, which regulates cell migration and nuclear gene expression, is required for hair follicle stem function but not for the normal homeostasis of the interfollicular skin. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we explored whether Rac1 contributes to wound healing in the skin and in the oral mucosa, the latter an anatomical site that presents similar architecture to that of the skin but is devoid of any hair follicle structures, and hence lacks hair follicle stem cells. Epidermal Rac1 gene excision led to the clearly delayed closure of cutaneous wounds. Remarkably, genetic ablation of Rac1 from the oral mucosa resulted in the complete inability of oral wounds to heal. We present evidence that the lack of oral mucosal re-epithelization may result from the reduced migratory capacity of cells lacking Rac1 together with altered expression of injury-induced proliferative and cellular stress-related expression programs. Conclusions/Significance Together, these observations support that while the normal development and homeostasis of the interfollicular skin and oral mucosa do not require Rac1 function, the interfollicular and oral epithelial stem cells may require a Rac1-dependent program to orchestrate the tissue response to injury and ultimate for wound closure. Ultimately, these findings may enable the molecular characterization of the acute tissue regenerative response of these stem cell populations, thus facilitating the identification of novel molecular-targeted strategies aimed at accelerating wound closure."
https://openalex.org/W2007859640,"Background Phenotypic differences among species have long been systematically itemized and described by biologists in the process of investigating phylogenetic relationships and trait evolution. Traditionally, these descriptions have been expressed in natural language within the context of individual journal publications or monographs. As such, this rich store of phenotype data has been largely unavailable for statistical and computational comparisons across studies or integration with other biological knowledge. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe Phenex, a platform-independent desktop application designed to facilitate efficient and consistent annotation of phenotypic similarities and differences using Entity-Quality syntax, drawing on terms from community ontologies for anatomical entities, phenotypic qualities, and taxonomic names. Phenex can be configured to load only those ontologies pertinent to a taxonomic group of interest. The graphical user interface was optimized for evolutionary biologists accustomed to working with lists of taxa, characters, character states, and character-by-taxon matrices. Conclusions/Significance Annotation of phenotypic data using ontologies and globally unique taxonomic identifiers will allow biologists to integrate phenotypic data from different organisms and studies, leveraging decades of work in systematics and comparative morphology."
https://openalex.org/W1999299765,"Hydrogen gas is a major biofuel and is metabolized by a wide range of microorganisms. Microbial hydrogen production is catalyzed by hydrogenase, an extremely complex, air-sensitive enzyme that utilizes a binuclear nickel-iron [NiFe] catalytic site. Production and engineering of recombinant [NiFe]-hydrogenases in a genetically-tractable organism, as with metalloprotein complexes in general, has met with limited success due to the elaborate maturation process that is required, primarily in the absence of oxygen, to assemble the catalytic center and functional enzyme. We report here the successful production in Escherichia coli of the recombinant form of a cytoplasmic, NADP-dependent hydrogenase from Pyrococcus furiosus, an anaerobic hyperthermophile. This was achieved using novel expression vectors for the co-expression of thirteen P. furiosus genes (four structural genes encoding the hydrogenase and nine encoding maturation proteins). Remarkably, the native E. coli maturation machinery will also generate a functional hydrogenase when provided with only the genes encoding the hydrogenase subunits and a single protease from P. furiosus. Another novel feature is that their expression was induced by anaerobic conditions, whereby E. coli was grown aerobically and production of recombinant hydrogenase was achieved by simply changing the gas feed from air to an inert gas (N2). The recombinant enzyme was purified and shown to be functionally similar to the native enzyme purified from P. furiosus. The methodology to generate this key hydrogen-producing enzyme has dramatic implications for the production of hydrogen and NADPH as vehicles for energy storage and transport, for engineering hydrogenase to optimize production and catalysis, as well as for the general production of complex, oxygen-sensitive metalloproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1984603937,"Melanoma is the major cause of skin cancer death worldwide. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by mutation of alpha-synuclein or other genes. Importantly, epidemiological studies have reported co-occurrence of melanoma and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that these two diseases could share common genetic components.Recently, we found that human melanoma cell lines highly express alpha-synuclein, whereas the protein is undetectable in the non-melanoma cancer cell lines tested. To investigate the expression of alpha-synuclein in human melanoma tissues, we immunostained sections of melanoma, nevus, non-melanocytic cutaneous carcinoma, and normal skin. alpha-Synuclein was positively detected in 86% of the primary and 85% of the metastatic melanoma sections, as well as in 89% of nevus sections. However, alpha-synuclein was undetectable in non-melanocytic cutaneous carcinoma and normal skin.The Parkinson's disease-related protein, alpha-synuclein, is expressed in both malignant and benign melanocytic lesions, such as melanomas and nevi. Although alpha-synuclein cannot be used to distinguish between malignant and benign melanocytic skin lesions, it might be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2020486147,"Salmonella infection is a common public health problem that can become chronic and increase the risk of inflammatory bowel diseases and cancer. AvrA is a Salmonella bacterial type III secretion effector protein. Increasing evidence demonstrates that AvrA is a multi-functional enzyme with critical roles in inhibiting inflammation, regulating apoptosis, and enhancing proliferation. However, the chronic effects of Salmonella and effector AvrA in vivo are still unknown. Moreover, alive, mutated, non-invasive Salmonella is used as a vector to specifically target cancer cells. However, studies are lacking on chronic infection with non-pathogenic or mutated Salmonella in the host.We infected mice with Salmonella Typhimurium for 27 weeks and investigated the physiological effects as well as the role of AvrA in intestinal inflammation. We found altered body weight, intestinal pathology, and bacterial translocation in spleen, liver, and gallbladder in chronically Salmonella-infected mice. Moreover, AvrA suppressed intestinal inflammation and inhibited the secretion of cytokines IL-12, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. AvrA expression in Salmonella enhanced its invasion ability. Liver abscess and Salmonella translocation in the gallbladder were observed and may be associated with AvrA expression in Salmonella.We created a mouse model with persistent Salmonella infection in vivo. Our study further emphasizes the importance of the Salmonella effector protein AvrA in intestinal inflammation, bacterial translocation, and chronic infection in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2049491117,"Despite the apparent cross-disciplinary interactions among scientific fields, a formal description of their evolution is lacking. Here we describe a novel approach to study the dynamics and evolution of scientific fields using a network-based analysis. We build an idea network consisting of American Physical Society Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme (PACS) numbers as nodes representing scientific concepts. Two PACS numbers are linked if there exist publications that reference them simultaneously. We locate scientific fields using a community finding algorithm, and describe the time evolution of these fields over the course of 1985-2006. The communities we identify map to known scientific fields, and their age depends on their size and activity. We expect our approach to quantifying the evolution of ideas to be relevant for making predictions about the future of science and thus help to guide its development."
https://openalex.org/W2070403587,"Whether or not animals habituate to repeated exposure to predator scents may depend upon whether there are predators associated with the cues. Understanding the contexts of habituation is theoretically important and has profound implication for the application of predator-based herbivore deterrents. We repeatedly exposed a mixed mob of macropod marsupials to olfactory scents (urine, feces) from a sympatric predator (Canis lupus dingo), along with a control (water). If these predator cues were alarming, we expected that over time, some red kangaroos (Macropus rufous), western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) and agile wallabies (Macropus agilis) would elect to not participate in cafeteria trials because the scents provided information about the riskiness of the area.We evaluated the effects of urine and feces independently and expected that urine would elicit a stronger reaction because it contains a broader class of infochemicals (pheromones, kairomones). Finally, we scored non-invasive indicators (flight and alarm stomps) to determine whether fear or altered palatability was responsible for the response. Repeated exposure reduced macropodid foraging on food associated with 40 ml of dingo urine, X = 986.75+/-3.97 g food remained as compared to the tap water control, X = 209.0+/-107.0 g (P<0.001). Macropodids fled more when encountering a urine treatment, X = 4.50+/-2.08 flights, as compared to the control, X = 0 flights (P<0.001). There was no difference in effect between urine or feces treatments (P>0.5). Macropodids did not habituate to repeated exposure to predator scents, rather they avoided the entire experimental area after 10 days of trials (R(2) = 83.8; P<0.001).Responses to urine and feces were indistinguishable; both elicited fear-based responses and deterred foraging. Despite repeated exposure to predator-related cues in the absence of a predator, macropodids persistently avoided an area of highly palatable food. Area avoidance is consistent with that observed from other species following repeated anti-predator conditioning, However, this is the first time this response has been experimentally observed among medium or large vertebrates - where a local response is observed spatially and an area effect is revealed over time."
https://openalex.org/W2046711233,"The Ohr (organic hydroperoxide resistance) family of 15-kDa Cys-based, thiol-dependent peroxidases is central to the bacterial response to stress induced by organic hydroperoxides but not by hydrogen peroxide. Ohr has a unique three-dimensional structure and requires dithiols, but not monothiols, to support its activity. However, the physiological reducing system of Ohr has not yet been identified. Here we show that lipoylated enzymes present in the bacterial extracts of Xylella fastidiosa interacted physically and functionally with this Cys-based peroxidase, whereas thioredoxin and glutathione systems failed to support Ohr peroxidase activity. Furthermore, we could reconstitute in vitro three lipoyl-dependent systems as the Ohr physiological reducing systems. We also showed that OsmC from Escherichia coli, an orthologue of Ohr from Xylella fastidiosa, is specifically reduced by lipoyl-dependent systems. These results represent the first description of a Cys-based peroxidase that is directly reduced by lipoylated enzymes. The Ohr (organic hydroperoxide resistance) family of 15-kDa Cys-based, thiol-dependent peroxidases is central to the bacterial response to stress induced by organic hydroperoxides but not by hydrogen peroxide. Ohr has a unique three-dimensional structure and requires dithiols, but not monothiols, to support its activity. However, the physiological reducing system of Ohr has not yet been identified.

These results represent the first description of a Cys-based peroxidase that is directly reduced by lipoylated enzymes. Release of oxidants is one of the main responses of a host against pathogens. During host-pathogen interactions, in an attempt to kill the pathogen, plant or animal hosts generate various oxidants by enzymatic systems (1.Tenhaken R. Levine A. Brisson L.F. Dixon R.A. Lamb C.

For instance, organic hydroperoxides are oxidants that can be formed by the reaction of molecular oxygen with unsaturated fatty acids catalyzed by lipoxygenases in response to pathogen infection (4.Jalloul A. Montillet J.L. Assigbetsé K. Agnel J.P. Delannoy E. Triantaphylidès C. Daniel J.F. Marmey P. Geiger J.P. Nicole M. Plant J. 2002; 32: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5.Gobel C.

Microbiol. 2006; 61: 847-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9.Poole L.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 240-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Ohr (organic hydroperoxide resistance) protein is a Cys-based, thiol-dependent peroxidase that plays a central role in the response of bacteria against organic peroxide-induced insult (10.Atichartpongkul S. Loprasert S. Vattanaviboon P. Whangsuk W. Helmann J.D. Mongkolsuk S. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ohr is exclusively present in bacteria (most of them pathogenic) and possesses a unique α/β fold that is not observed in the structures of peroxiredoxins and glutathione peroxidases (11.Oliveira M.A. Guimarães B.G. Cussiol J.R. Medrano F.J. Gozzo F.C. Netto L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12.Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Ohr peroxidase activity requires reduction of the enzyme's disulfide group formed upon catalytic reduction of the organic hydroperoxide (13.Cussiol J.R. Alves S.V. de Oliveira M.A. Netto L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11570-11578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme's physiological reducing agent has not yet been identified. Ohr belongs to a family of proteins that also comprise osmotically inducible protein (OsmC). These proteins were initially identified as part of the bacterial response to osmotic stress (14.Gutierrez C. Devedjian J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence analysis, Atichartpongkul et al. (10.Atichartpongkul S. Loprasert S. Vattanaviboon P. Whangsuk W. Helmann J.D. Mongkolsuk S. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1775-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) proposed Ohr and OsmC homologues as two protein subfamilies. Later, it was demonstrated that OsmC enzymes also possess thiol-dependent peroxidase activity and share the same structural fold with Ohr proteins (15.Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Nikolov D.B. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2838-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16.Shin D.H. Choi I.G. Busso D. Jancarik J. Yokota H. Kim R. Kim S.H. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2004; 60: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because only dithiols, and not monothiols, can be utilized by Ohr, we and others hypothesized that lipoate may act as a natural reducing agent of Ohr (11.Oliveira M.A. Guimarães B.G. Cussiol J.R. Medrano F.J. Gozzo F.C. Netto L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13.Cussiol J.R. Alves S.V. de Oliveira M.A. Netto L.E. J. Biol.

Lipoate is a dithiol/disulfide redox compound well known to play important roles in metabolic pathways due to its capacity to serve as a cofactor in the multienzyme complexes that catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of α-keto acids (18.Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38329-38336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Besides lipoylated E2 subunits, 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes also contain Lpd (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, subunit E3 from α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex) activity that can catalyze the redox processes between lipoylated E2 enzymes and NADH/NAD+ in both reductive and oxidative directions (19.Bunik V.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Free dihydrolipoate, the reduced form of lipoate, has also been reported to scavenge free radicals and other oxidants (20.Moini H. Packer L. Saris N.E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2002; 182: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). However, the cellular availability of free lipoate is significantly lower than that of other endogenous low molecular weight antioxidants, such as GSH and ascorbic acid (21.Schupke H. Hempel R. Peter G. Hermann R. Wessel K. Engel J. Kronbach T. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 855-862PubMed Google Scholar). Xylella fastidiosa is a Gram-negative, xylem-limited phytopathogenic bacterium that is the causative agent of several economically important diseases, such as citrus variegated chlorosis and Pierce disease in citrus and grapes, among other plants (22.Purcell A.H. Hopkins D.L. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1996; 34: 131-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Here, we show that peroxidase activity of Ohr from X. fastidiosa is supported by lipoylated proteins but not by thioredoxin and glutathione systems. Therefore, these data represent a previously undescribed enzymatic activity. We also showed that OsmC from Escherichia coli is specifically reduced by lipoyl-dependent systems. All reagents purchased had the highest degree of purity. Lipoic acid was purchased from Sigma in its oxidized form. It was solubilized in a phosphate-buffered solution through the high pH method (23.Suzuki Y.J. Tsuchiya M. Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 454-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Lipoamide was purchased from Sigma in its oxidized form. A stock solution was prepared by diluting lipoamide to 100 mm in absolute methanol. Lipoamide (purchased from Sigma; catalog no. T5875) was reduced through the addition of sodium borohydride (purchased from Sigma; catalog no. S9125) as described previously (24.Reed L.J. Koike M. Levitch M.E. Leach F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 143-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All commercial enzymes utilized in this paper were purchased from Sigma (glutaredoxin 1 (catalog no. G3531), glutathione reductase (catalog no. G3664), glutathione peroxidase (catalog no. G6137), thioredoxin (catalog no. T0910), and thioredoxin reductase (catalog no. T7915)). Reduced lipoamide was quantified using Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) 2The abbreviations used are: DTNB5, 5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)t-BHPtert-butyl hydroperoxidePBSphosphate-buffered salineDTPAdiethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. (25.Ellman G. Lysko H. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membrane was obtained from Bio-Rad. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from GE Healthcare. The anti-lipoic antibody was obtained in the laboratory of Dr. Luke Szweda (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation) as described previously (26.Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The anti-Ohr antibody was obtained by immunization of rabbits with recombinant Ohr. Briefly, in the first immunization, an Ohr solution (1 mg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was mixed with Freund's adjuvant (Sigma, catalog no. F5506) (1:1, v/v). The Bench MarkTM protein ladder was purchased from Invitrogen. The rabbits were immunized three times, with 2-week intervals between immunizations. After the third immunization, the rabbits were sedated, and the blood was collected with a syringe. The serum from the samples was recovered and stored at −80 °C. 5, 5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) tert-butyl hydroperoxide phosphate-buffered saline diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. The lpd, lpdA (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, subunit E3 from pyruvate dehydrogenase complex), PDHB (dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase, subunit E2 from pyruvate dehydrogenase complex), and sucB (dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase, subunit E2 from α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex) genes were PCR-amplified from X. fastidiosa 9a5c strain genomic DNA. The following primers were used: lpdforw (5′-GGGAATTCCATATGACGTTGC-3′), lpdrev (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGTTTGCTTTATG-3′), lpdAforw (5′-GGGAATTCCATATGACGGTGATTG-3′), and lpdArev (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTACTTTGCTGAAG-3′) (the underlined bases denote the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, for Lpd and LpdA genes); sucBforw (5′-CTAGCTAGCATGACCATCGAAG-3′) and sucBrev (5′-CGCGGATCCTTATAAGCC-3′) (the underlined bases represent the NheI and BamHI restriction sites, relative to the forward and reverse primers, respectively); PDHBforw (5′-GGGAATTCCATATGACCGAAATCAAGGAAG-3′) and PDHBrev (5′-CGGGATCCTCAACGGGCCTTAC-3′) (the underlined bases represent the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, relative to the forward and reverse primers, respectively). The osmC gene was PCR-amplified from Escherichia coli DH5-α strain genomic DNA. The following primers were used: osmCforw (5′-CGATCCATATGACAATCCATAAGAAAGG-3′ and osmCrev (5′-CGCGGATCCTTACGATTTCAACTGGTAATCC-3′) (the underlined bases represent the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, relative to the forward and reverse primers, respectively). PCR products were double-digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into digested pET15b (for Lpd, LpdA, and PDHB), pET28a (for sucB), and pPROEX (for osmC) expression vectors. The sequences of the resulting pET15b/Lpd, PET15b/LpdA, PET15b/PDHB, pET28a/sucB, and pPROEX/osmC plasmids were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. E. coli DH5-α strain was transformed by electroporation (Gene Pulser® II, Bio-Rad) with the expression vectors and cultured to increase plasmid production. Plasmid extraction was performed using Perfectprep® plasmid mini (Eppendorf). BL21(DE3) and AD494(DE3) strains were transformed by electroporation. sucB and PDHB genes were transformed into Bl21(DE3) cells, and lpd and lpdA genes were transformed into AD494(DE3) cells. The resulting strains were used for expression and purification of the Lpd, LpdA, SucB, and PDHB recombinant proteins. The osmC gene was expressed in the E. coli DH5-α strain. Cloning, expression, and purification of Ohr were performed as described previously (13.Cussiol J.R. Alves S.V. de Oliveira M.A. Netto L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11570-11578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Bl21(DE3) strains transformed with pET15b/PDHB and pET28a/sucB, AD494 strains transformed with pET15b/lpd and pET15b/lpdA were cultured (50 ml) overnight in LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics. Each culture was transferred to 1 liter of fresh LB plus antibiotics and grown until the OD reached 0.6–0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The cells were grown overnight at 20 °C and were then harvested by centrifugation. For the expression of lipoylated enzymes from the strains containing pET15b/lpdA, pET15b/PDHB, and pET15b/sucB, 300 μg/ml lipoic acid was added to the culture medium to ensure maximum lipoylation of these proteins. For the DH5-α strain transformed with pPROEX/osmC, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were grown for 3 h at 37 °C and were then harvested by centrifugation. The pellets were washed and resuspended in start buffer (phosphate buffer, 20 mm, pH 7.4). Eight cycles of 25 s of sonication (40% amplitude) followed by 50 s on ice were applied to cell suspensions. Cell extracts were kept on ice during 1% streptomycin sulfate treatment for 20 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 31,500 × g for 40 min to remove nucleic acid precipitates. Finally, the cell extracts were each applied to a nickel affinity column (Hi-Trap from GE Healthcare). The conditions of protein purification were optimized using the gradient procedure for imidazole concentration described by the manufacturer. All recombinant proteins were quantified by A280 through in silico prediction of extinction coefficients (ExPASy; available on the World Wide Web). Lipoylated enzymes SucB and LpdA possess 1 mol of lipoate per 1 mol of enzyme, and PDHB possesses 2 mol of lipoate per 1 mol of enzyme. Cell pellets from X. fastidiosa J1A12 and E. coli DH5α (OD ∼0.6–1.0) were resuspended in phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing NaCl (50 mm) and disrupted by sonication. Cell extracts were kept on ice during 1% streptomycin sulfate treatment for 20 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 31,500 × g for 40 min to remove nucleic acid precipitates. Total protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (27.Kruger N.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 32: 9-15PubMed Google Scholar). For immunodetection, the samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were electroblotted onto a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane in Tris-glycine buffer at 50 V for 90 min. Blotted membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) with 5% skim milk (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times for 5 min with PBS-T and incubated with an anti-lipoic acid (1:5000 in PBS-T) or anti-Ohr (1:1000 in PBS-T) antibody for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing. The membrane was subsequently incubated with an anti-phosphatase rabbit antibody (1:1000) for 1 h (purchased from the Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After washing, the proteins were detected following incubation with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate. The levels of lipoylated proteins were quantitated by densitometry using ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). Immunoprecipitation was performed as follows. 1 mg of X. fastidiosa lysate (previously incubated for 30 min with Protein A-Sepharose) was incubated with anti-lipoic acid (1:50) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then incubated with Protein A-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation. The immunoprecipitate was washed five times with Tris-HCl buffer (20 mm), NaCl (300 mm) and boiled with 40 μl of sample buffer containing dithiothreitol (10 mm). Electrophoresis and transfer were performed. Blotted membranes were incubated with an anti-Ohr antibody (1:1000 in PBS-T) overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was subsequently incubated with an anti-phosphatase rabbit antibody for one hour and proteins were detected following incubation with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium phosphatase substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). To isolate secreted proteins as well as proteins weakly attached to the cell surface, we use a modified protocol from Smolka et al. (28.Smolka M.B. Martins D. Winck F.V. Santoro C.E. Castellari R.R. Ferrari F. Brum I.J. Galembeck E. Della Coletta Filho H. Machado M.A. Marangoni S. Novello J.C. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 ml of X. fastidiosa was centrifuged, and the pellet was washed twice with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 3 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The supernatant from each washing step was precipitated with a cold ethanol/acetone/acetic acid (50:50:0.1, v/v/v) solution on ice for 30 min and solubilized in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 0.5% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After the washing steps, the pelleted cells were then lysed with 200 μl of the following solution: 10 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After the addition of 100 mm dithiothreitol, the proteins (from the supernatant and cellular fraction) were boiled for 3 min and loaded onto a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Following electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with an anti-Ohr antibody (1:1000) or an anti-lipoic acid antibody (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature. The disulfide reductase activities of the reducing systems were determined using the DTNB (Ellman's reagent) assay (29.Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), 0.5 mm DTNB, and 0.2 mm NAD(P)H and were carried out at 37 °C and were initiated by the addition of NADH. The peroxidase activities of Cys-based, thiol peroxidases were measured using recombinant Lpd or LpdA from X. fastidiosa and lipoamide or recombinant E2 enzymes from X. fastidiosa (PDHB or SucB). Decay due to NADH consumption was measured by A340 (ϵ = 6290 m−1.cm−1). The reaction mixtures contained 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTPA (pH 7.4), and 0.2 mm NADH. All reactions were performed at 37 °C and were initiated by the addition of peroxide at various concentrations. The peroxidase activities of Cys-based thiol peroxidases were measured using recombinant thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase (TSNC and TRR, respectively) from X. fastidiosa or commercial thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase from E. coli. Decay due to NADPH consumption was measured by A340 (ϵ = 6220 m−1·cm−1). The reaction mixtures contained 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTPA (pH 7.4), and 0.2 mm NADPH. All reactions were performed at 37 °C and were initiated by the addition of t-BHP at various concentrations. The peroxidase activity of Ohr from X. fastidiosa, OsmC from E. coli, and human glutathione peroxidase were measured using reduced glutathione and commercial glutathione reductase from bakers' yeast. Decay due to NADPH consumption was measured by A340 (ϵ = 6220 m−1·cm−1). The reaction mixtures contained 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTPA (pH 7.4), and 0.2 mm NADPH. All reactions were performed at 37 °C and were initiated by the addition of t-BHP at various concentrations. Lipoylated proteins from X. fastidiosa, a bacterial phytopathogen, were immunoprecipitated utilizing a polyclonal antibody specific for lipoic acid (anti-lipoic acid). Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that Ohr co-precipitated with lipoylated enzymes (Fig. 1A). Moreover, we observed that Ohr is present in the extracellular fraction (or weakly attached to the cell surface) along with a protein reactive to anti-lipoic acid that co-migrated with SucB, the E2 subunit of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (Fig. 1B, lanes 3, 4, 9, and 10). Furthermore, another study detected Ohr and LpdA in the extracellular environment through proteomic analyses of X. fastidiosa (28.Smolka M.B. Martins D. Winck F.V. Santoro C.E. Castellari R.R. Ferrari F. Brum I.J. Galembeck E. Della Coletta Filho H. Machado M.A. Marangoni S. Novello J.C. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). LpdA is an enzyme harboring its own substrate, a lipoyl group (30.Håkansson A.P. Smith A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29521-29530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ohr was also found in the intracellular fraction of X. fastidiosa (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Therefore, we investigated whether any other lipoylated proteins were present in this compartment. Immunochemical evidence indicated that all three lipoylated enzymes (LpdA, PDHB, and SucB) predicted by the annotation of the X. fastidiosa genome (see the X. fastidiosa Comparative Genome Project Web site from Laboratório Nacional de Computação Científica) are present in the cell lysates (Fig. 1C). Thus, in principle, all of these proteins could support Ohr peroxidase activity in the intracellular compartment. If this is the case, then the ability of X. fastidiosa lysates to support Ohr activity should be decreased if lipoylated proteins were immunodepleted. In fact, the removal of lipoylated proteins from X. fastidiosa and E. coli lysates reduced the rate of NADH oxidation compared with the same preparation that was not immunodepleted with anti-lipoic acid (Fig. 1D). The residual activity detected in the immunodepleted lysates correlated with the presence of lipoylated proteins that were not completely removed during the immunoprecipitation step (supplemental Fig. 1). Next, we investigated the ability of Lpd from X. fastidiosa to alternatively function as a physiological reductant of Ohr instead of their classical function as oxidants during α-keto acid oxidative decarboxylation. Initially, the disulfide reductase activity of recombinant Lpd from X. fastidiosa in the presence of free lipoamide was demonstrated (Fig. 2A). We then showed that this lipoamide-dependent system supported the peroxidase activity of Ohr (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, only Ohr and not the other two Cys-based peroxidases from X. fastidiosa (PrxQ (peroxiredoxin Q) and AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, subunit C)) presented lipoyl-dependent peroxidase activity (Fig. 2B). Parallel lines were obtained in Lineweaver-Burk plots, indicating a ping-pong reaction mechanism (Fig. 2C), as expected for other Cys-based peroxidases (31.Trujillo M. Ferrer-Sueta G. Thomson L. Flohé L. Radi R. Subcell. Biochem. 2007; 44: 83-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32.Tosatto S.C. Bosello V. Fogolari F. Mauri P. Roveri A. Toppo S. Flohé L. Ursini F. Maiorino M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1515-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Using a bisubstrate kinetic approach (33.Segel H.I. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. Wiley Interscience, New York1993: 606-612Google Scholar), Km values in the micromolar range for lipoamide and t-BHP were obtained (Table 1, first lane, and supplemental Fig. 2). In contrast, millimolar amounts of H2O2 are required to saturate Ohr (Fig. 2D) under non-limiting amounts of lipoamide. Therefore, Ohr reduced t-BHP at least 10,000 times more efficiently than H2O2 (Table 1). The Ohr active site pocket is surrounded by several hydrophobic residues (11.Oliveira M.A. Guimarães B.G. Cussiol J.R. Medrano F.J. Gozzo F.C. Netto L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12.Lesniak J. Barton W.A. Nikolov D.B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which may explain the very high Km value for H2O2. This large difference in affinities for hydroperoxides has never been described before for other Cys-based peroxidases. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of Ohr to detoxify t-BHP (106 m−1·s−1) is similar or even higher than other Cys-based thiol peroxidases (9.Poole L.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 240-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 34.Fourquet S. Huang M.E. D'Autreaux B. Toledano M.B. Antioxid.

Open table in a new tab Initially, we cloned and expressed enzymes from X. fastidiosa predicted to have lipoyl binding domains (supplemental Fig. 3), which include SucB (the E2 component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex), PDHB (the E2 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex), and LpdA. The physiological role of LpdA is still unclear. Because its gene is located close to genes encoding proteins of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, it was annotated as its E3 component. However, LpdA in Streptococcus pneumonia is not associated with any two oxo-acid dehydrogenase complexes (30.Håkansson A.P. Smith A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29521-29530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In any case, recombinant SucB, PDHB, and LpdA presented disulfide reductase activity (Fig. 2A). Then we tested whether these lipoyl-dependent reducing systems were capable of supporting Ohr peroxidase activity. Both SucB and PDHB promoted Ohr-dependent peroxide removal in the presence of Lpd. Besides that, LpdA alone or in combination with SucB or PDHB also supported Ohr peroxidase activity (Fig. 3A). Therefore, we have reconstituted three possible pathways involved in the decomposition of organic hydroperoxides. We also investigated whether other classical thiol-containing systems, well known reductants for other thiol peroxidases (peroxiredoxins and glutathione peroxidases), could act as alternative electron donors to Ohr. Recombinant TSNC and TRR from X. fastidiosa were obtained, and they presented disulfide reductase activity (Fig. 3B). However, Ohr presented no peroxidase activity, even with the use of high concentrations of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase (Fig. 3C). Under the same conditions, PrxQ from X. fastidiosa was active (Fig. 3C). In fact, taking into account data from the literature, it is evident that the concentrations of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase employed here were high enough to support the enzymatic activity of other Cys-based peroxidases (36.Munhoz D.C.

https://openalex.org/W2068589328,"Development of lung granulomata is a hallmark of infections caused by virulent mycobacteria, reflecting both protective host response that restricts infection spreading and inflammatory pathology. The role of host genetics in granuloma formation is not well defined. Earlier we have shown that mice of the I/St strain are extremely susceptible to Mycobacterium tuberculosis but resistant to M. avium infection, whereas B6 mice show a reversed pattern of susceptibility. Here, by directly comparing: (i) characteristics of susceptibility to two infections in vivo; (ii) architecture of lung granulomata assessed by immune staining; and (iii) expression of genes encoding regulatory factors of neutrophil influx in the lung tissue, we demonstrate that genetic susceptibility of the host largely determines the pattern of lung pathology. Necrotizing granuloma surrounded by hypoxic zones, as well as a massive neutrophil influx, develop in the lungs of M. avium-infected B6 mice and in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-infected I/St mice, but not in the lungs of corresponding genetically resistant counterparts. The mirror-type lung tissue responses to two virulent mycobacteria indicate that the level of genetic susceptibility of the host to a given mycobacterial species largely determines characteristics of pathology, and directly demonstrate the importance of host genetics in pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2157592943,"Background Binding of chemokines to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is classically described as initiating inflammatory cell migration and creating tissue chemokine gradients that direct local leukocyte chemotaxis into damaged or transplanted tissues. While chemokine-receptor binding has been extensively studied during allograft transplantation, effects of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interactions with chemokines on transplant longevity are less well known. Here we examine the impact of interrupting chemokine-GAG interactions and chemokine-receptor interactions, both locally and systemically, on vascular disease in allografts. Methodology/Principal Findings Analysis of GAG or CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) deficiency were coupled with the infusion of viral chemokine modulating proteins (CMPs) in mouse aortic allograft transplants (n = 239 mice). Inflammatory cell invasion and neointimal hyperplasia were significantly reduced in N-deacetylase-N-sulfotransferase-1 (Ndst1f/fTekCre+) heparan sulfate (GAG)-deficient (Ndst1−/−, p<0.044) and CCR2-deficient (Ccr2−/−, p<0.04) donor transplants. Donor tissue GAG or CCR2 deficiency markedly reduced inflammation and vasculopathy, whereas recipient deficiencies did not. Treatment with three CMPs was also investigated; Poxviral M-T1 blocks CC chemokine receptor binding, M-T7 blocks C, CC, and CXC GAG binding, and herpesviral M3 binds receptor and GAG binding for all classes. M-T7 reduced intimal hyperplasia in wild type (WT) (Ccr2+/+, p≤0.003 and Ccr2−/−, p≤0.027) aortic allografts, but not in Ndst1−/− aortic allografts (p = 0.933). M-T1 and M3 inhibited WT (Ccr2+/+ and Ndst1+/+, p≤0.006) allograft vasculopathy, but did not block vasculopathy in Ccr2−/− (p = 0.61). M-T7 treatment alone, even without immunosuppressive drugs, also significantly prolonged survival of renal allograft transplants (p≤0.001). Conclusions/Significance Interruption of chemokine-GAG interactions, even in the absence of chemokine-receptor blockade, is a highly effective approach to reduction of allograft rejection, reducing vascular inflammation and prolonging allograft survival. Although chemokines direct both local and systemic cell migration, interruption of inherent chemokine responses in the donor tissue unexpectedly had a greater therapeutic impact on allograft vasculopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2163647339,"The TRPM group of cation channels plays diverse roles ranging from sensory signaling to Mg2+ homeostasis. In most metazoan organisms the TRPM subfamily is comprised of multiple members, including eight in humans. However, the Drosophila TRPM subfamily is unusual in that it consists of a single member. Currently, the functional requirements for this channel have not been reported. Here, we found that the Drosophila TRPM protein was expressed in the fly counterpart of mammalian kidneys, the Malpighian tubules, which function in the removal of electrolytes and toxic components from the hemolymph. We generated mutations in trpm and found that this resulted in shortening of the Malpighian tubules. In contrast to all other Drosophila trp mutations, loss of trpm was essential for viability, as trpm mutations resulted in pupal lethality. Supplementation of the diet with a high concentration of Mg2+ exacerbated the phenotype, resulting in growth arrest during the larval period. Feeding high Mg2+ also resulted in elevated Mg2+ in the hemolymph, but had relatively little effect on cellular Mg2+. We conclude that loss of Drosophila trpm leads to hypermagnesemia due to a defect in removal of Mg2+ from the hemolymph. These data provide the first evidence for a role for a Drosophila TRP channel in Mg2+ homeostasis, and underscore a broad and evolutionarily conserved role for TRPM channels in Mg2+ homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2039593499,"Mussels are conspicuous and often abundant members of rocky shores and may constitute an important site for the nitrogen cycle due to their feeding and excretion activities. We used shotgun metagenomics of the microbial community associated with the surface of mussels (Mytilus californianus) on Tatoosh Island in Washington state to test whether there is a nitrogen-based microbial assemblage associated with mussels. Analyses of both tidepool mussels and those on emergent benches revealed a diverse community of Bacteria and Archaea with approximately 31 million bp from 6 mussels in each habitat. Using MG-RAST, between 22.5–25.6% were identifiable using the SEED non-redundant database for proteins. Of those fragments that were identifiable through MG-RAST, the composition was dominated by Cyanobacteria and Alpha- and Gamma-proteobacteria. Microbial composition was highly similar between the tidepool and emergent bench mussels, suggesting similar functions across these different microhabitats. One percent of the proteins identified in each sample were related to nitrogen cycling. When normalized to protein discovery rate, the high diversity and abundance of enzymes related to the nitrogen cycle in mussel-associated microbes is as great or greater than that described for other marine metagenomes. In some instances, the nitrogen-utilizing profile of this assemblage was more concordant with soil metagenomes in the Midwestern U.S. than for open ocean system. Carbon fixation and Calvin cycle enzymes further represented 0.65 and 1.26% of all proteins and their abundance was comparable to a number of open ocean marine metagenomes. In sum, the diversity and abundance of nitrogen and carbon cycle related enzymes in the microbes occupying the shells of Mytilus californianus suggest these mussels provide a node for microbial populations and thus biogeochemical processes."
https://openalex.org/W2073731658,"Background Megaloolithid eggs have long been associated with sauropod dinosaurs. Despite their extensive and worldwide fossil record, interpretations of egg size and shape, clutch morphology, and incubation strategy vary. The Pinyes locality in the Upper Cretaceous Tremp Formation in the southern Pyrenees, Catalonia provides new information for addressing these issues. Nine horizons containing Megaloolithus siruguei clutches are exposed near the village of Coll de Nargó. Tectonic deformation in the study area strongly influenced egg size and shape, which could potentially lead to misinterpretation of reproductive biology if 2D and 3D maps are not corrected for bed dip that results from tectonism. Methodology/Findings Detailed taphonomic study and three-dimensional modelling of fossil eggs show that intact M. siruguei clutches contained 20–28 eggs, which is substantially larger than commonly reported from Europe and India. Linear and grouped eggs occur in three superimposed levels and form an asymmetric, elongate, bowl-shaped profile in lateral view. Computed tomography data support previous interpretations that the eggs hatched within the substrate. Megaloolithid clutch sizes reported from other European and Indian localities are typically less than 15 eggs; however, these clutches often include linear or grouped eggs that resemble those of the larger Pinyes clutches and may reflect preservation of incomplete clutches. Conclusions/Significance We propose that 25 eggs represent a typical megaloolithid clutch size and smaller egg clusters that display linear or grouped egg arrangements reported at Pinyes and other localities may represent eroded remnants of larger clutches. The similarity of megaloolithid clutch morphology from localities worldwide strongly suggests common reproductive behaviour. The distinct clutch geometry at Pinyes and other localities likely resulted from the asymmetrical, inclined, and laterally compressed titanosaur pes unguals of the female, using the hind foot for scratch-digging during nest excavation."

Using an interdisciplinary approach, we confirmed the potential of plant KATs to be regulated by the redox environment in the peroxisome within a physiological range. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest an interaction between KAT and the multifunctional protein that is responsible for the preceding two steps in β-oxidation, which would allow a route for substrate channeling.

https://openalex.org/W2126521960,"Background Photosystem II (PSII) is the most thermally sensitive component of photosynthesis. Thermal acclimation of this complex activity is likely to be critically important to the ability of photosynthetic organisms to tolerate temperature changes in the environment. Methodology/Findings We have analysed gene expression using whole-genome microarrays and monitored alterations in physiology during acclimation of PSII to elevated growth temperature in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. PSII acclimation is complete within 480 minutes of exposure to elevated temperature and is associated with a highly dynamic transcriptional response. 176 genes were identified and classified into seven distinct response profile groups. Response profiles suggest the existence of an early transient phase and a sustained phase to the acclimation response. The early phase was characterised by induction of general stress response genes, including heat shock proteins, which are likely to influence PSII thermal stability. The sustained phase consisted of acclimation-specific alterations that are involved in other cellular processes. Sustained responses included genes involved in phycobillisome structure and modification, photosynthesis, respiration, lipid metabolism and motility. Approximately 60% of genes with sustained altered expression levels have no known function. The potential role of differentially expressed genes in thermotolerance and acclimation is discussed. We have characterised the acclimation physiology of selected gene ‘knockouts’ to elucidate possible gene function in the response. Conclusions/Significance All mutants show lower PSII rates under normal growth conditions. Basal PSII thermotolerance was affected by mutations in clpB1, cpcC2, hspA, htpG and slr1674. Final PSII thermotolerance was affected by mutations in cpcC2, hik34, hspA and hypA1, suggesting that these gene products play roles in long-term thermal acclimation of PSII."
https://openalex.org/W1968189087,"Abnormal fatty acid composition (FA) in plasma and tissue lipids frequently occurs in homozygous and even in heterozygous carriers of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations. The mechanism(s) underlying these abnormalities remained, however, poorly understood despite the potentially CFTR contributing role.The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of CFTR depletion on FA uptake, composition and metabolism using the intestinal Caco-2/15 cell line. shRNA-mediated cftr gene silencing induced qualitative and quantitative modifications in FA composition in differentiated enterocytes as determined by gas-liquid chromatography. With the cftr gene disruption, there was a 1,5 fold increase in the total FA amount, largely attributable to monounsaturated and saturated FA compared to controls. The activity of delta-7 desaturase, estimated by the 16:1(n-7)/16:0, was significantly higher in knockdown cells and consistent with the striking elevation of the n-7 FA family. When incubated with [14C]-oleic acid, CFTR-depleted cells were capable of quick incorporation and export to the medium concomitantly with the high protein expression of L-FABP known to promote intracellular FA trafficking. Accordingly, lipoprotein vehicles (CM, VLDL, LDL and HDL), isolated from CFTR knockdown cells, exhibited higher levels of radiolabeled FA. Moreover, in the presence of [14C]-acetate, knockdown cells exhibited enhanced secretion of newly synthesized phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesteryl esters and free FA, thereby suggesting a stimulation of the lipogenic pathway. Conformably, gene expression of SREBP-1c, a key lipogenic transcription factor, was increased while protein expression of the phosphorylated and inactive form of acetylCoA carboxylase was reduced, confirming lipogenesis induction. Finally, CFTR-depleted cells exhibited lower gene expression of transcription factors (PPARalpha, LXRalpha, LXRbeta and RXRalpha).Collectively, our results indicate that CFTR depletion may disrupt FA homeostasis in intestinal cells through alterations in FA uptake and transport combined with stimulation of lipogenesis that occurs by an LXR/RXR-independent mechanism. These findings exclude a contributing role of CFTR in CF-associated fat malabsorption."
https://openalex.org/W2006040538,"Background In 2009 a new pandemic disease appeared and spread globally. The recent emergence of the pandemic influenza virus H1N1 first isolated in Mexico and USA raised concerns about vaccine availability. We here report our development of an adenovirus-based influenza H1N1 vaccine tested for immunogenicity and efficacy to confer protection in animal model. Methods We generated two adenovirus(Ad5)-based influenza vaccine candidates encoding the wildtype or a codon-optimized hemagglutinin antigen (HA) from the recently emerged swine influenza isolate A/California/04/2009 (H1N1)pdm. After verification of antigen expression, immunogenicity of the vaccine candidates were tested in a mouse model using dose escalations for subcutaneous immunization. Sera of immunized animals were tested in microneutalization and hemagglutination inhibition assays for the presence of HA-specific antibodies. HA-specific T-cells were measured in IFNγ Elispot assays. The efficiency of the influenza vaccine candidates were evaluated in a challenge model by measuring viral titer in lung and nasal turbinate 3 days after inoculation of a homologous H1N1 virus. Conclusions/Significance A single immunization resulted in robust cellular and humoral immune response. Remarkably, the intensity of the immune response was substantially enhanced with codon-optimized antigen, indicating the benefit of manipulating the genetic code of HA antigens in the context of recombinant influenza vaccine design. These results highlight the value of advanced technologies in vaccine development and deployment in response to infections with pandemic potential. Our study emphasizes the potential of an adenoviral-based influenza vaccine platform with the benefits of speed of manufacture and efficacy of a single dose immunization."
https://openalex.org/W1980079918,"Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFalpha) is a pleiotropic cytokine extensively studied for its role in the pathogenesis of a variety of disease conditions, including in inflammatory diseases. We have recently shown that, in vitro, that TNFalpha utilizes PLD1 to mediate the activation of NFkappaB and ERK1/2 in human monocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate the role(s) played by phospholipase D1 (PLD1) in TNFalpha-mediated inflammatory responses in vivo.Studies were performed in vivo using a mouse model of TNFalpha-induced peritonitis. The role of PLD1 was investigated by functional genomics, utilizing a specific siRNA to silence the expression of PLD1. Administration of the siRNA against PLD1 significantly reduced PLD1 levels in vivo. TNFalpha triggers a rapid pyrogenic response, but the in vivo silencing of PLD1 protects mice from the TNFalpha-induced rise in temperature. Similarly TNFalpha caused an increase in the serum levels of IL-6, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta: this increase in cytokine/chemokine levels was inhibited in mice where PLD1 had been silenced. We then induced acute peritonitis with TNFalpha. Intraperitoneal injection of TNFalpha triggered a rapid increase in vascular permeability, and the influx of neutrophils and monocytes into the peritoneal cavity. By contrast, in mice where PLD1 had been silenced, the TNFalpha-triggered increase in vascular permeability and phagocyte influx was substantially reduced. Furthermore, we also show that the TNFalpha-mediated upregulation of the cell adhesion molecules VCAM and ICAM1, in the vascular endothelium, were dependent on PLD1.These novel data demonstrate a critical role for PLD1 in TNFalpha-induced inflammation in vivo and warrant further investigation. Indeed, our results suggest PLD1 as a novel target for treating inflammatory diseases, where TNFalpha play key roles: these include diseases ranging from sepsis to respiratory and autoimmune diseases; all diseases with considerable unmet medical need."
https://openalex.org/W1977689520,"The crystal structure of the full-length rat peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme, type 1 (rpMFE1), has been determined at 2.8 A resolution. This enzyme has three catalytic activities and two active sites. The N-terminal part has the crotonase fold, which builds the active site for the Delta(3),Delta(2)-enoyl-CoA isomerase and the Delta(2)-enoyl-CoA hydratase-1 catalytic activities, and the C-terminal part has the (3S)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase fold and makes the (3S)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase active site. rpMFE1 is a multidomain protein having five domains (A-E). The crystal structure of full-length rpMFE1 shows a flexible arrangement of the A-domain with respect to the B-E-domains. Because of a hinge region near the end of the A-domain, two different positions of the A-domain were observed for the two protein molecules (A and B) of the asymmetric unit. In the most closed conformation, the mode of binding of CoA is stabilized by domains A and B (helix-10), as seen in other crotonase fold members. Domain B, although functionally belonging to the N-terminal part, is found tightly associated with the C-terminal part, i.e. fixed to the E-domain. The two active sites of rpMFE1 are approximately 40 A apart, separated by a tunnel, characterized by an excess of positively charged side chains. Comparison of the structures of rpMFE1 with the monofunctional crotonase and (3S)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase superfamily enzymes, as well as with the bacterial alpha(2)beta(2)-fatty acid oxidation multienzyme complex, reveals that this tunnel could be important for substrate channeling, as observed earlier on the basis of the kinetics of rpMFE1 purified from rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1992553683,"Bacterial infections occur when the natural host defenses are overwhelmed by invading bacteria. The main component of the host defense is impaired when neutrophil count or function is too low, putting the host at great risk of developing an acute infection. In people with intact immune systems, neutrophil count increases during bacterial infection. However, there are two important clinical cases in which they remain constant: a) in patients with neutropenic-associated conditions, such as those undergoing chemotherapy at the nadir (the minimum clinically observable neutrophil level); b) in ex vivo examination of the patient's neutrophil bactericidal activity. Here we study bacterial population dynamics under fixed neutrophil levels by mathematical modelling. We show that under reasonable biological assumptions, there are only two possible scenarios: 1) Bacterial behavior is monostable: it always converges to a stable equilibrium of bacterial concentration which only depends, in a gradual manner, on the neutrophil level (and not on the initial bacterial level). We call such a behavior type I dynamics. 2) The bacterial dynamics is bistable for some range of neutrophil levels. We call such a behavior type II dynamics. In the bistable case (type II), one equilibrium corresponds to a healthy state whereas the other corresponds to a fulminant bacterial infection. We demonstrate that published data of in vitro Staphylococcus epidermidis bactericidal experiments are inconsistent with both the type I dynamics and the commonly used linear model and are consistent with type II dynamics. We argue that type II dynamics is a plausible mechanism for the development of a fulminant infection."

It has been assumed that ""receptorless"" DT cannot bind to and kill cells. In the present study, we report that ""receptorless"" recombinant DT385 is in fact cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell lines.In vitro cytotoxicity of DT385 was measured by cell proliferation, cell staining and apoptosis assays. For in vivo studies, the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) system was used to evaluate the effect of DT385 on angiogenesis. The CAM and mouse model system was used to evaluate the effect of DT385 on HEp3 and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor growth, respectively.Of 18 human cancer cell lines tested, 15 were affected by DT385 with IC(50) ranging from 0.12-2.8 microM. Furthermore, high concentrations of DT385 failed to affect growth arrested cells. The cellular toxicity of DT385 was due to the inhibition of protein synthesis and induction of apoptosis. In vivo, DT385 diminished angiogenesis and decreased tumor growth in the CAM system, and inhibited the subcutaneous growth of LLC tumors in mice.DT385 possesses anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity and may have potential as a therapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2022866679,"Conventional supervised classification of satellite images uses a single multi-band image and coincident ground observations to construct spectral signatures of land cover classes. We compared this approach with three alternatives that derive signatures from multiple images and time periods: (1) signature generalization: spectral signatures are derived from multiple images within one season, but perhaps from different years; (2) signature expansion: spectral signatures are created with data from images acquired during different seasons of the same year; and (3) combinations of expansion and generalization. Using data for northern Laos, we assessed the quality of these different signatures to (a) classify the images used to derive the signature, and (b) for use in temporal signature extension, i.e., applying a signature obtained from data of one or several years to images from other years. When applying signatures to the images they were derived from, signature expansion improved accuracy relative to the conventional method, and variability in accuracy declined markedly. In contrast, signature generalization did not improve classification. When applying signatures to images of other years (temporal extension), the conventional method, using a signature derived from a single image, resulted in very low classification accuracy. Signature expansion also performed poorly but multi-year signature generalization performed much better and this appears to be a promising approach in the temporal extension of spectral signatures for satellite image classification."
https://openalex.org/W2054429547,"Does specific immunity, innate immunity or resource (red blood cell) limitation control the first peak of the blood-stage parasite in acute rodent malaria infections? Since mice deficient in specific immunity exhibit similar initial dynamics as wild-type mice it is generally viewed that the initial control of parasite is due to either limitation of resources (RBC) or innate immune responses. There are conflicting views on the roles of these two mechanisms as there is experimental evidence supporting both these hypotheses. While mathematical models based on RBC limitation are capable of describing the dynamics of primary infections, it was not clear whether a model incorporating the key features of innate immunity would be able to do the same. We examine the conditions under which a model incorporating parasite and innate immunity can describe data from acute Plasmodium chabaudi infections in mice. We find that innate immune response must decay slowly if the parasite density is to fall rather than equilibrate. Further, we show that within this framework the differences in the dynamics of two parasite strains are best ascribed to differences in susceptibility to innate immunity, rather than differences in the strains' growth rates or their propensity to elicit innate immunity. We suggest that further work is required to determine if innate immunity or resource limitation control acute malaria infections in mice."

https://openalex.org/W1984795213,"Fusion of placental villous cytotrophoblasts with the overlying syncytiotrophoblast is essential for the maintenance of successful pregnancy, and disturbances in this process have been implicated in pathological conditions such as pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth retardation. Caveolin-1 has been shown to be expressed in human villous cytotrophoblast and to be downregulated during fusion into syncytiotrophoblast but it is unclear whether it plays a role in this process.We used RNA interference to determine whether caveolin-1 plays a role in differentiation and fusion in the BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line, a model of villous cytotrophoblast fusion. Assessment of cell fusion by desmosomal protein immunostaining revealed that cells transfected with caveolin-1 siRNA showed significantly enhanced fusion in response to treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP compared with cells transfected with a non-silencing control. Furthermore, caveolin-1 knockdown alone was sufficient to promote spontaneous fusion. In addition, biochemical differentiation, assessed by expression of placental alkaline phosphatase, was upregulated in caveolin-1 siRNA-transfected cells, with or without dbcAMP treatment. Assessment of Akt phosphorylation showed that caveolin-1 knockdown resulted in a significant reduction in phosphorylation at Thr(308).Taken together, these results suggest that caveolin-1 regulates BeWo cell differentiation and fusion, possibly through a mechanism involving modulation of Akt activity."

Tremendous efforts have been made to identify new anti-mitosis compounds for developing more effective and less toxic anti-cancer drugs. We have identified LJK-11, a synthetic analog of 5, 8-disubstituted quinazolines, as a novel mitotic blocker. LJK-11 inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of many different types of tumor cells. It prevented mitotic spindle formation and arrested cells at early phase of mitosis. Detailed in vitro analysis demonstrated that LJK-11 inhibited microtubule polymerization. In addition, LJK-11 had synergistic effect with another microtubule inhibitor colchicine on blocking mitosis, but not with vinblastine or nocodazole. Therefore, LJK-11 represents a novel anti-microtubule structure. Understanding the function and mechanism of LJK-11 will help us to better understand the action of anti-microtubule agents and to design better anti-cancer drugs."
