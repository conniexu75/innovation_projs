It also regulates cellular responses to stress and intracellular Ca2+ levels. A variety of toxic insults can result in ER stress that ultimately leads to apoptosis. Apoptosis is initiated by the activation of members of the caspase family and serves as a central mechanism in the cell death process. The present study was carried out to determine the role of caspases in triggering ER stress-induced cell death. Treatment of cells with ER stress inducers such as brefeldin-A or thapsigargin induces the expression of caspase-12 protein and also leads to translocation of cytosolic caspase-7 to the ER surface. Caspase-12, like most other members of the caspase family, requires cleavage of the prodomain to activate its proapoptotic form. Caspase-7 associates with caspase-12 and cleaves the prodomain to generate active caspase-12, resulting in increased cell death. We propose that any cellular insult that causes prolonged ER stress may induce apoptosis through caspase-7-mediated caspase-12 activation. The data underscore the involvement of ER and caspases associated with it in the ER stress-induced apoptotic process.

However, the central role of the ER in initiating cell death, following prolonged stress, is not well understood. Activation of caspases, a family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases, is a central mechanism in the apoptotic cell death process (17Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2147) Google Scholar). The localization of caspases and translocation of their active products appear to be critical for the development of the apoptotic process (18Zhivotovsky B. Samali A. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although studies have demonstrated the presence of caspase-7 as an unprocessed p35 proform both in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions (19Pai J.T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5437-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Chandler J.M. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10815-10818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), caspase-12 in neurons, and other cells, is primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (21Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 22Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Caspase-12 is specifically involved in apoptosis that results from stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (21Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 22Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J.

Caspase-12, whose activation may be mediated by calpain, participates in ER stress-induced apoptosis that is blocked by zVAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor (21Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 22Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Apoptosis triggered through pathways that do not involve the endoplasmic reticulum, such as serum deprivation or Fas activation, does not result in activation of caspase-12 (21Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 22Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The present study was performed to determine whether ER stress-induced cell death requires the interaction and subsequent activation of caspases, and if so, which ones. We demonstrate that ER stress not only induces the expression of caspase-12 but also causes translocation of cytosolic caspase-7 to the ER surface. We further show that caspase-7 is required for caspase-12 activation. Prolonged ER stress also facilitates movement of active caspase-12 into the cytoplasm where it interacts with caspase-9 and thus may set in motion the cytosolic component of the ER stress-induced apoptotic cascade. Our findings suggest that the ER plays a pivotal role in the activation of a subset of caspases during ER stress-mediated cell death that is induced by an array of insults. The human embryonic kidney 293T cell line was used for transient transfection using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Typically 2 × 106 and 4 × 106 cells were seeded in 10- or 15-cm dishes, respectively, and transfected 1 day later with 6 or 12 μg of the specified construct using a ratio of 1 μg:5 μl of DNA:LipofectAMINE. The transfection efficiency using these conditions was about 65–75%. Mouse caspase-12 cDNA was amplified via PCR using primers flanking the start and stop codons (mouse caspase-12-F: agcggcacgagcacagccatg and mouse caspase-12-R: gcatgagagttgcctgtgcta). PCR parameters were 2.5 μl of 4-fold-diluted cDNA reaction products, 25 pmprimers, 0.5 mm dNTPs, and 2 units of Taqpolymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) with 2.5 μl of 10× buffer. Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 65 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. The 1.2-kb PCR product was gel-purified and ligated into the pCDNA 3.1 expression vector. Using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the following caspase catalytic mutants were generated: caspase-7 (C186A) and caspase-9 (C287A) (25Lu D.C. Rabizadeh S. Chandra S. Shayya R.F. Ellerby L.M. Ye X. Salvesen G.S. Koo E.H. Bredesen D.E. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Mutants of caspase-12 were obtained by a similar procedure. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed, and Western blot analyses were performed to verify protein expression. His-tagged caspase-7 (gift of Dr. Guy Salvesen) was purified by nickel affinity chromatography as described previously (26Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28476-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Untreated and 2.5 μmthapsigargin-treated (24 h) 293T human renal epithelial cells were resuspended in ice-cold fractionation buffer, pH 7.4 (20 mmHEPES, 10 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture). After cell lysis, nuclei were pelleted by a 10-min, 750-g spin. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in the above buffer, and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant contained the soluble cytoplasmic fraction, and the pellet constituted the microsomal fraction. The purity of each fraction was assessed by the presence of specific marker proteins: PARP for nuclei, cytochrome c for mitochondria, and SREBP-1 for ER. Equal amounts of protein from normal and thapsigargin-treated cells were analyzed by electrophoresis. In our fractionation procedures, the low salt lysis buffer used for the isolation procedure did not lead to nonspecific binding of proteins to organelles based on the presence of the marker proteins only in their specific compartments. Control, 2.5 μm thapsigargin-treated, and 2.5 μm brefeldin-A-treated cell extracts were subfractionated into microsomal fractions. The purity of the microsomal fraction was assessed by the presence of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an ER lumen protein. Isolated microsomes were digested by 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 30 min at 35 °C. At the end of the reaction, samples were detected by Western blotting by loading equal amounts of total microsomal protein. Cell-free cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as previously described (29Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano C.A. Cashman N.R. Green D.R. Bredesen D.E.

Briefly, cells were lifted gently, pelleted at 200 ×g, and the resulting pellet was washed in 50 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube with 10 ml of hypotonic extraction buffer (HEB; containing 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g (4 °C) to form a tight pellet, and the volume of the cell pellet was approximated. The supernatant was aspirated, and HEB was added to a volume between 0.5 and 1× the pellet volume. The cells were transferred to a 2-ml Dounce homogenizer and allowed to swell for 20–30 min on ice. Cells were lysed with 20–100 gentle strokes of a B-type pestle. The desired extent of lysis (>90%) was monitored under the microscope by trypan blue staining. The cell lysate was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 ×g (4 °C). The clarified supernatant was removed carefully and either was used immediately or stored in aliquots at −84 °C. For reactions activated by cytochrome c and dATP, cell free extract (100–200 μg of protein) was incubated with cytochromec (10 μm) and dATP (1 mm) at 37 °C for 1 h. Electrophoresis of equal amounts of total protein was performed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes at 4 °C for Western blot analysis. Membranes were probed with a 1:50 dilution of anti-caspase-12 antibody (gift of Dr. Junying Yuan), a 1:1000 dilution of the anti-CPP32 monoclonal antibody, 1:1000 dilution of anti-caspase-9 polyclonal antibody, 1:500 dilution of anti-caspase-7 monoclonal antibody (all from Transduction/PharMingen Laboratories, San Diego, CA). The anti-caspase-12 antibody was capable of recognizing human caspase-12 protein. The blots were incubated in a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 1 h followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection of the proteins with Hyperfilm ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL). Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (31Sperandio S. de Belle I. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14376-14381Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 32Ye X. Mehlen P. Rabizadeh S. VanArsdale T. Zhang H. Shin H. Wang J.J. Leo E. Zapata J. Hauser C.A. Reed J.C. Bredesen D.E. J.

Briefly, 293T cells treated with an ER stress inducer, were harvested, washed, and resuspended in cell lysis buffer (500 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA). A total of 500–1000 μg of protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation. The lysate was first pre-cleared with an appropriate control IgG corresponding to the host species of the primary antibody. The pre-cleared cell lysate was incubated with 0.5–5 μg of primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Later, 20 μl of resuspended volume of the appropriate agarose conjugate was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h to overnight. After extensive washes, proteins bound to protein A-Sepharose or protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were analyzed by immunoblotting. In a typical IP experiment we loaded 2.5-fold more starting protein in the IP lane than in the lysate lane. The presence of the interacting protein was detected by Western blot analysis using the respective antibody. Control and treated cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 as previously described (29Ellerby H.M. Martin S.J. Ellerby L.M. Naiem S.S. Rabizadeh S. Salvesen G.S. Casiano C.A. Cashman N.R. Green D.R.

Cells were scored as apoptotic if their nuclei exhibited margination and condensation of chromatin and/or nuclear fragmentation. A minimum of 100 cells from three different areas of each plate was evaluated for quantification of apoptosis. Brefeldin-A, a fungal metabolite, blocks protein folding and export and induces ER stress and cell death (9Guo H. Tittle T.V. Allen H. Maziarz R.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,15Shao R.G. Shimizu T. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the ER Ca-ATPase, also causes ER stress and induces apoptosis in many cell types (13McCormick T.S. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6087-6092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 16Yu Z. Luo H. Fu W. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 155: 302-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). We used both of these compounds to induce ER stress and to investigate the role of caspases in mediating cell death. Cell extracts prepared from cells treated with 2.5 μm brefeldin or 2.5 μmthapsigargin showed increased caspase-12 protein expression (Fig.1, a and b), with attenuation of expression at 48 h after thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 1 b). Prolonged treatment of cells with brefeldin also caused a decrease in caspase-12 protein expression (data not shown). Such a regulated caspase-12 protein expression was not seen when cells were treated with tamoxifen (Fig. 1 a), which causes apoptosis without inducing ER stress as confirmed by the GRP78 expression pattern. A high level of GRP78 protein expression is indicative of ER stress (8Chatterjee S. Cheng M.F. Berger S.J. Berger N.A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4405-4411PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li L.J. Li X.

Similarly, no change in caspase-3, -8, or -9 protein expression was seen in cell extracts treated with brefeldin or thapsigargin (Fig. 1 c), suggesting that ER stress specifically induces caspase-12 protein expression. Recent studies have demonstrated the association of caspase-7 and caspase-12 to the ER compartment (18Zhivotovsky B. Samali A. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 19Pai J.T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine the subcellular localization of caspase-7 and caspase-12 before and after ER stress induction, cell lysates from control and thapsigargin-treated 293T cells were fractionated into nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble fractions and analyzed by Western blotting. The quality of the fractionation experiments was controlled by assessing the distribution of standard marker proteins in the different fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures”. As shown in Fig.2, caspase-12 was predominantly found in the microsomal fraction in control extracts. Thapsigargin treatment resulted in increased caspase-12 protein expression in the microsomal fraction. In addition, the active form of caspase-12 (42 kDa) was also detected in the soluble fraction after thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 2). Caspases-3, -8, and -9 were exclusively seen in the soluble fraction before and after treatment. In contrast, caspase-7, which was detected only in the soluble fraction before treatment, co-fractionated with the ER compartment following thapsigargin treatment. Similar results were also seen with cellular fractions from other cell types treated with brefeldin or thapsigargin (data not shown). This suggests that ER stress induction causes translocation of (a) cytosolic caspase-7 to the ER compartment and (b) active caspase-12 out of the ER.Figure 2Caspases-12 and -7 have different localizations during ER stress. Western blots of nuclear (N), mitochondrial (M), microsomal (ER), and cytoplasmic (S) fractions of 293T human renal epithelial cells before and after treatment with 2.5 μm thapsigargin for 24 h. Membranes were probed with anti-caspase-12, anti-caspase-8, anti-caspase-9, anti-caspase-7, and anti-caspase-3 antibodies. Cellular fractions were also probed for standard marker proteins, namely PARP (nuclei), cytochrome c(mitochondria), and SREBP (ER). The low salt lysis buffer that we used for the isolation procedure did not cause any leakage of proteins, nor did it lead to any nonspecific binding of proteins to organelles as indicated by the presence of SREBP, PARP, cytochrome c, and caspases-9, -8, and -3 that were present only in their specific compartments. Each Western blot is representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To understand the topology of caspases-7 and -12 in the ER compartment before and after ER stress, we isolated the microsomal fraction from untreated, brefeldin-A-treated, and thapsigargin-treated 293T cells and subjected them to limited trypsin digestion. The purity of microsomes was assessed by staining for PDI, an ER lumen protein. As shown in Fig. 3, caspase-7 is not detected in microsomes isolated from normal cells but is present in microsomes prepared from thapsigargin- and brefeldin-treated cells. Addition of trypsin resulted in complete digestion of caspase-7. Similarly, caspase-12 was completely digested by trypsin in microsomes isolated from control and treated cells. In contrast, PDI under similar conditions was resistant to trypsin treatment. These data indicate that, although caspase-12 is localized on the cytoplasmic side of the ER, ER stress also causes translocation of a subpopulation of cytosolic caspase-7 to the surface of the ER compartment. There was no evidence of localization of caspases-3, -8, and -9 on the cytoplasmic side of the ER before or after ER stress (data not shown). The subcellular location of caspase-12 and its active form has already been demonstrated and confirmed by us (21Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 22Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Similarly, caspase-7 is known to associate with the ER compartment following apoptotic stimuli (18Zhivotovsky B. Samali A. Gahm A. Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 644-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 19Pai J.T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5437-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20Chandler J.M. Cohen G.M. MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10815-10818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and ER stress (Fig. 2). Given these established subcellular locations for caspases-7 and -12, we proceeded to investigate possible interactions between them. The interaction of caspase-12 and caspase-7 was evaluated in cells treated with thapsigargin for 24 h, by which time caspase-7 was demonstrated to have translocated to the ER surface (Fig. 2). Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-caspase-12 antibody, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using antisera specific for caspase-7. Association of caspase-7 and caspase-12 was seen only in cell extracts treated with thapsigargin (Fig.4 a). Because prolonged ER stress induces activation and movement of caspase-12 into the cytoplasm (Fig. 2), we sought to determine whether caspase-12 associates with any components of the apoptosome or other caspases. As shown in Fig.4 b, caspase-9 co-immunoprecipitated with caspase-12, providing evidence of interaction between caspase-9 and caspase-12. Immunoprecipitation of caspase-12 from thapsigargin-treated lysates did not reveal any association with Apaf-1, cytochrome c, caspase-8, or caspase-3 (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction of caspase-12 with caspase-7 and caspase-9 is specific. Similar results were seen following treatment with brefeldin (data not shown). If the mechanism of ER stress-induced apoptosis does indeed involve caspase-7 and caspase-9 (in addition to the ER resident caspase-12), we reasoned that catalytic mutants of these caspases, which function as dominant negatives, should inhibit ER stress-induced apoptosis. This was found to be the case: 293T-cell survival, following exposure to thapsigargin for 36 h, was increased in cultures overexpressing a dominant negative catalytic mutant of caspase-7 (C7DN) and of caspase-9 (C9DN) (25Lu D.C.

Although we do not rule out the induction of a mild stress response during transfection leading to some protection from a subsequent shock, we did not observe such protection in the pcDNA3-transfected cells treated with thapsigargin (Fig.4 c). To determine whether caspase-7 might regulate caspase-12 activation, cell lysates from untreated and thapsigargin-treated cells were incubated with purified active caspase-7 protein. As shown in Fig.5 a, caspase-7 effectively cleaved caspase-12, giving rise to more of a 42-kDa cleavage product than in control lysates. In addition to this 42-kDa band, caspase-7-treated samples also showed a specific caspase-12 product in the 35-kDa range, which could arise from the cleavage of the prodomain and both the prodomain and the intersubunit region, respectively (see Fig. 6 a).Figure 6Potential caspase cleavage sites in caspase-12. a, caspase-12 has at least two additional potential caspase sites, Asp-94 and Asp-341, in addition to the calpain sites (Thr-132, Lys-158) and one caspase site (Asp-318) reported earlier (22Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Calpain cleavage followed by autocatalytic processing of caspase-12 generates nearly similar fragment sizes as seen with the cleavage at Asp-94 and Asp-341. Although Asp-94 is closer to the N terminus and may represent the COOH terminus of the prodomain, Asp-341 is located downstream of the active site cysteine, possibly between the large and small subunits. b, cell-free extracts were made from 293T cells transfected with wild type caspase-12, D94N and D341N constructs. Samples (200 μg of protein) were incubated with 10 μm cytochrome c and 1 mm dATP at 35 °C for 1 h. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting for caspase-12. Although the 42-kDa product was seen only in the WT- and D341N-transfected samples, both D94N- and D341N-transfected samples failed to yield the active 32-kDa band. The data shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further elucidate the role of caspase-7 in the activation of caspase-12, we cloned caspase-12 from thapsigargin-treated mouse fibroblast cells. Overexpression of caspase-12 did not induce apoptosis in 293T cells (Fig. 5 b). Western blot analysis of cell lysates transfected with caspase-12 revealed a 60-kDa procaspase-12 band and another band (45 kDa) that may represent an autocleavage product (23Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Cells cotransfected with caspase-7 and caspase-12 expression vectors showed an additional 42- and a 35-kDa caspase-12 band. This was also associated with increased cell death suggesting that the 42-kDa band may represent the active form of caspase-12, which may cleave itself to generate the additional 35-kDa band. Caspase-7 was transfected in amounts that by themselves did not induce any significant cell death. Co-transfection of cells with caspase-12 and the catalytic mutant of caspase-7 (C7DN) not only blocked the cleavage and formation of the active 42- and 35-kDa caspase-12 products, but also attenuated the cell death process (Fig. 5 b). This suggests that caspase-7 may be an upstream regulator of caspase-12. Because cytochrome c, dATP, and Apaf-1-mediated caspase-9 activation also result in activation of caspase-7 (35Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 36Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether this process also activated caspase-12. When cell free extracts from capsase-12-transfected 293T cells were incubated with cytochrome c and dATP, caspase-12 was cleaved to its active 42-kDa band and 35-kDa products (Fig. 5 c), suggesting that caspase-12 can also be activated by the cytochrome cinitiated caspase cascade involving active caspase-9 or active caspase-7. Caspase-12 has two predicted caspase cleavage sites in addition to the calpain sites and one caspase site reported earlier (22Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The DEDD(94)G site lies closer to the N terminus, presumably representing the COOH terminus of the prodomain. The VETD(341)F site lies downstream from the QACRG active site, between the large and small subunits (Fig. 6 a). We generated two mutants of caspase-12, D94N and D341N. Overexpression of the caspase-12 mutants did not induce apoptosis in 293T cells. Addition of cytochrome c and dATP to cell-free extracts, made from 293T cells overexpressing the WT, D94N, and D341N constructs, resulted in the generation of the active 42-kDa fragment only from WT- and D341N-expressing cells and not from the D94N cells. This suggests that the Asp-94 site is required to generate the active form of caspase-12 (Fig. 6 b). Interestingly, both mutant forms of caspase-12 also failed to generate the active 35-kDa band that arises out of the 42-kDa band. This suggests that the activation of caspase-12 proceeds first by a cleavage at Asp-94 to generate the active 42 kDa, which in turn undergoes a self cleavage at Asp-341 position to generate both the small and large subunit (Fig. 6 a). The ER is a principal site for protein synthesis and folding and also serves as a cellular storage site for calcium (2Rapoport T.A. Science. 1992; 258: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 3Sambrook J.F. Cell. 1990; 61: 197-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Agents that block protein folding or export, inhibitors of protein glycosylation, and agents that affect calcium uptake and release from the ER can all lead to ER stress and ultimately cell death (8Chatterjee S.

Although the roles of the plasma membrane with its plethora of death receptors and the mitochondria in initiating cell death have been well studied (37Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar), the involvement of the ER in the apoptotic process is still not clear. Our studies suggest that ER stress-induced cell death may proceed through caspase-7-mediated caspase-12 activation. Caspase-12, which belongs to the interleukin-1β converting enzyme subfamily of caspases (21Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar), has some unique properties that are not shared by other family members. Apoptosis, triggered through pathways that do not involve the endoplasmic reticulum, does not result in activation of caspase-12 (21Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 22Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 24Bitko V. Barik S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 80: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our data, as shown in Fig. 1, confirm these earlier observations. Addition of tamoxifen, which induces cell death predominantly via the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, did not up-regulate or activate caspase-12 protein (Fig. 1). Incidentally, translocation and activation of caspase-7 is seen in Fas and etoposide-induced cell death as well as following ER stress. Thus the specificity of the ER stress-induced cell death pathway is associated with the up-regulation and activation of only caspase-12 protein. Human caspase-12 exists on the cytoplasmic side of the ER, and this may be a mechanism to prevent its activation in normal cells (21Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-12 may therefore require its cleavage from the ER membrane surface by proteases that may be present on the ER surface or may warrant a translocation of cytoplasmic proteases to the ER surface. Recent studies have indicated that elevation of intracellular calcium levels causes activation and movement of calpain to the ER surface where it activates caspase-12 (22Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Our results describe an alternative mode of caspase-12 activation during ER stress that involves movement of caspase-7 to the ER surface. Our studies show that caspase-7 can cleave and activate caspase-12 resulting in increased cell death that is attenuated by the catalytic mutant of caspase-7. Further studies will also determine whether caspase-7 undergoes modifications during ER stress causing its translocation to the ER surface, because this type of a specific recruitment to the ER surface is not observed with other caspases. Caspase-12 activation by caspase-7 may also require additional ER stress components that serve as adaptor molecules whose expression may not be induced by non-ER stress signals. A possible mechanism may involve binding of caspases-7 and -12 to GRP78 at the ER surface resulting in their autoactivation. 2R. V. Rao, A. Peel, A. Logvinova, G. del Rio, E. Hermel, T. Yokota, P. C. Goldsmith, L. M. Ellerby, H. M. Ellerby, and D. E. Bredesen, submitted for publication. This would be similar to the activation of caspase-8 and -9, both of which are thought to be activated by “induced proximity” brought about by adaptor molecules. In support of this possibility, ER stress has recently been shown to cause clustering of caspase-12 with TRAF2 and IRE1 (23Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Once active, caspase-7 cleaves caspase-12 at Asp-94 and Asp-341 sites that are different from the calpain cleavage sites (22Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) to generate active caspase-12. Earlier studies (38Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) on caspase-9 suggest that cleavage site mutants would not act as dominant negative inhibitors because full-length caspase-9 is active when complexed with Apaf-1, cytochrome c, and (d)ATP. Caspases that lack the active site cysteine (QAC XG sequence that is conserved among all caspases, including caspase-12) act as dominant negatives. Based on the above finding and our preliminary studies on the in vitro expression of the C12D94N protein, we believe that caspase-12 D94N is very likely to be catalytically active. Cleavage of the caspase-12 prodomain either by calpain or by caspase-7 may somehow disrupt the membrane association of caspase-12, resulting in its activation. Although caspase-7 is highly related to caspase-3 and shows the same synthetic substrate specificity in vitro, it is possible that they may have distinct roles in ER-stress-induced apoptosis. The significance of caspase-12 translocation to the cytosol and its downstream targets is yet to be understood. Our studies demonstrating the interaction of caspase-12 and caspase-9 and the attenuation of ER-stress-induced cell death by the catalytic mutant of caspase-9 (C9DN) suggest a role for caspase-12 in caspase-9-mediated processes. In conclusion, these studies highlight the relationship between caspases and ER stress responses leading to cell death and the role of the ER in modulating the cell death process through the activation of caspases.

https://openalex.org/W1966431705,"Human multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) has recently been determined to confer resistance to the antiviral purine analog 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine and methotrexate. However, neither its substrate selectivity nor physiological functions have been determined. Here we report the results of investigations of the<i>in vitro</i> transport properties of MRP4 using membrane vesicles prepared from insect cells infected with MRP4 baculovirus. It is shown that expression of MRP4 is specifically associated with the MgATP-dependent transport of cGMP, cAMP, and estradiol 17-β-d-glucuronide (E<sub>2</sub>17βG). cGMP, cAMP, and E<sub>2</sub>17βG are transported with<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> values of 9.7 ± 2.3 μm and 2.0 ± 0.3 pmol/mg/min, 44.5 ± 5.8 μm and 4.1 ± 0.4 pmol/mg/min, and 30.3 ± 6.2 μm and 102 ± 16 pmol/mg/min, respectively. Consistent with its ability to transport cyclic nucleotides, it is demonstrated that the MRP4 drug resistance profile extends to 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine, two anticancer purine analogs that are converted in the cell to nucleotide analogs. On the basis of its capacity to transport cyclic nucleotides and E<sub>2</sub>17βG, it is concluded that MRP4 may influence diverse cellular processes regulated by cAMP and cGMP and that its substrate range is distinct from that of any other characterized MRP family member."
https://openalex.org/W2013782445,"Hyaluronan (HA), an important glycosaminoglycan constituent of the extracellular matrix, has been implicated in angiogenesis. It appears to exert its biological effects through binding interactions with at least two cell surface receptors: CD44 and receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM). Recent in vitrostudies have suggested potential roles for these two molecules in various aspects of endothelial function. However, the relative contribution of each receptor to endothelial functions critical to angiogenesis and their roles in vivo have not been established. We therefore investigated the endothelial expression of these proteins and determined the effects of antibodies against RHAMM and CD44 on endothelial cell (EC) function and in vivoangiogenesis. Both receptors were detected on vascular endotheliumin situ, and on the surface of cultured EC. Further studies with active blocking antibodies revealed that anti-CD44 but not anti-RHAMM antibody inhibited EC adhesion to HA and EC proliferation, whereas anti-RHAMM but not CD44 antibody blocked EC migration through the basement membrane substrate, Matrigel. Although antibodies against both receptor inhibited in vitro endothelial tube formation, only the anti-RHAMM antibody blocked basic fibroblast growth factor-induced neovascularization in mice.

Molema G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 237-268PubMed Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). During this process endothelial cells (EC)1 in an established vessel initially sever their normal associations with adjacent endothelial cells, migrate, and proliferate into the surrounding tissue, where they reestablish their cell-to-cell attachments to form new capillaries. Given this understanding, the interactions of endothelial cells with the extracellular matrix, and the receptors that mediate these interactions, are of critical importance to the formation of new blood vessels. Hyaluronan (HA), an important constituent of the extracellular matrix, is a glycosaminoglycan composed of repeating disaccharide units ofd-glucuronic acid andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine (3Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). This ubiquitously distributed molecule regulates cellular events such as cell proliferation and locomotion that are required for a variety of biological processes including tumorigenesis, morphogenesis, inflammation and host response to injury (reviewed in Ref. 4Savani R.C. Bagli D.J. Harrison R.E. Turley E.A. Garg H.G. Longaker M.T. Scarless Wound Healing. Marcel Dekker, New York2000: 115-142Google Scholar). HA has also been implicated in the formation of vessels. However, its effects on in vivo angiogenesis and EC function are complex and have been reported to depend on HA concentration and molecular size (5Rooney P. Kumar S. Ponting J. Wang M. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). High molecular weight HA (at concentrations > 100 μg/ml) inhibits EC proliferation and disrupts confluent endothelial monolayers (6West D.C. Kumar S. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 183: 179-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings are the observations in chick embryo limb buds that avascular regions are rich in native high molecular weight HA and that expression of this form of HA in normally vascular areas results in decreased vascularity (7Feinberg R.N. Beebe D.C. Science. 1983; 220: 1177-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In contrast, low molecular weight HA stimulates EC proliferation (6West D.C. Kumar S. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 183: 179-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), induces in vitro endothelial tube formation (8Rahmanian M. Pertoft H. Kanda S. Christofferson R. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin P.

HA appears to exert its biological effects through binding interactions with specific cell-associated receptors (12Sherman L. Sleeman J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). A number of HA-binding proteins have been identified, and two molecularly distinct cell-surface receptors for HA have been characterized, namely CD44 and RHAMM (for receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility) (12Sherman L.

Specifically, preliminary in vitro studies have suggested potential roles for these two molecules in aspects of HA-dependent endothelial function (17Trochon V. Mabilat C. Bertrand P. Legrand Y.

However, the relative contributions of each receptor to endothelial functions critical to angiogenesis and their roles in vivo have not been established. In this paper, we therefore investigated the contribution of the HA-binding receptors, RHAMM and CD44, to EC functions and to angiogenesis in vivo. Both receptors were noted to be present on vascular endothelium in situ and on the surface of cultured EC. Using blocking antibodies specific to each receptor, we show that CD44 is the major determinant of EC adhesion to HA and EC proliferation, whereas RHAMM regulates EC migration through the basement membrane substrate Matrigel. Further, although antibodies against each receptor inhibited in vitro endothelial tube formation, only the anti-RHAMM antibody blocked bFGF-induced neovascularization in mice. Together, these data provide evidence for the involvement endothelial HA-binding receptors in specific endothelial cell functions and angiogenesis and suggest that they may represent new targets for anti-angiogenic therapy. Human endothelial cells (HUVEC) and a murine endothelial cell line (H5V), were cultured as described previously (20Christofidou-Solomidou M. Nakada M. Williams J. Muller W. DeLisser H. J.

Confocal microscopic images were obtained using a computer-interfaced, laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS 4D) in the Confocal Core Facility at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Simultaneous wavelength scanning allowed superimposition of fluorescent labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red fluorophores at wavelengths of 488 nm and 568 nm respectively. Laser power was fixed at 75% for all image acquisition. Image output was at 1024 × 1024 pixels. Endothelial cells were treated with various anti-human or anti-murine PECAM-1 mAbs for 1 h at 4 °C. The primary antibody was then removed, the cells washed with PBS, and a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse or anti-rat secondary antibody (Cappell) was added for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, flow cytometry was performed using an Ortho Cytofluorograph 50H cell sorter equipped with a 2150 data handling system (Ortho Instruments, Westwood, MA). HUVEC, cultured in T-75 flasks, were washed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS and then incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 15 min with 3 ml of 1 mmEDTA in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS. Cells were then scraped with a rubber policeman. The resulting lysates were transferred to 15-ml tubes, centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm, washed once with cold PBS, and then centrifuged. The residual pellets were sonicated several times in 1-s bursts on ice in 5 ml of membrane preparation buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.05 mm, 0.5 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, pH 7.1) followed by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min. After the supernatants were removed, the tubes were ultracentrifuged at 40,5000 rpm for 45 min and the pellet resuspended in 125 μl of membrane preparation buffer. Samples were stored at −80 °C. HUVEC, cultured in T-75 flasks, were washed with cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS. The cells were then incubated for 10 min with 500 μl of lysis buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and Sigma protease inhibitor at 1:20 dilution). Cells were then scraped, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant collected and stored at −80 °C. HUVEC cultured in T-75 flasks were washed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS. The cells were then harvested by scraping the flasks with 1 ml of PBS and the resulting lysates transferred to microcentrifuge tubes that were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The pellets were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended in 1 ml of fresh Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2% Igepal, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated for 5 min on ice with occasional stirring, and then centrifuged at 300 rpm for 5 min. Nuclear extracts were then released by resuspending the pellets in Buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 MgCl, 25% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0 μg/liter leupeptin and pepstatin) and incubating the tubes on ice for 10 min with intermittent gentle shaking. Nuclear extracts were stored at −80 °C. Western blot analysis was performed using the NOVEX NuPAGE electrophoresis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 1 mm 4–15% BisTris gels according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 10 μg of lysate was loaded to each well and gels were run at 200 V at 4 °C for 50 min in NuPAGE MOPS SDS running buffer under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 30 V for 60 min at room temperature. The membrane was then blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tween/Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) (100 mm Tris base, 1.5 m NaCl adjusted to pH 7.4 with 0.1% Tween 20). The primary antibody was then applied overnight at 4 °C. On the following day, the membrane was washed with TTBS four times, for 10 min each time. A horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature. Following this, the membrane was washed with TTBS followed by two 15-min washes with TBS. The blots were developed using a chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HUVEC were cultured for 24 h in 96-well plates and the number of viable cells determined using a commercially available non-radioactive colorimetric assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Titer 96® AQueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay, Promega, Madison WI). HA (as Healon) at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in water containing N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide at 0.184 mg/ml, was mixed with an equal volume of 1-ethyl-3-(dimethyaminopropyl)carbodiimide HCl (1.23 mg/ml). 100 μl of the resulting solution was then added to each well of a 96-well plate for 2 h at room temperature, followed by washing of the wells with PBS. In other experiments 100 μl of Matrigel (25 μg/ml; Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) was added to the well and allowed to dry overnight at 37 °C. The wells with HA or Matrigel coupled to the plate were then blocked with 2% BSA and washed with PBS. EC (20,000 cells) labeled overnight with 3[H]thymidine and resuspended in serum-free media containing BSA or antibody were added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Following incubation, lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 and 1% SDS in PBS) was added to each and the radioactivity counts of the lysate determined. Matrigel-coated transwell inserts (Costar; 8-mm pore filter) were prepared by twice adding 100 μl of Matrigel (250 μg/ml) to the transwell and allowing the Matrigel to dry at 37 °C in a non-humidified oven for 24 h. EC (100,000 cells) labeled overnight with 3[H]thymidine and resuspended in media (with 10% serum) containing BSA or antibody were added to the transwells and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The EC pass through the pores of the filter and adhere on the lower surface of the filter (27Ito Y. Iwamoto Y. Tanaka K. Okuyama K. Sugioka Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 67: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After incubation with BSA or antibody, the wells were removed and washed, and the top surface of the filter wiped with a cotton swab. The filters were then carefully cut out, placed in scintillation fluid, and counted in a β-counter. For each antibody condition, migration was expressed as percentage of BSA control. In vitro tube formation was studied using previously described procedures (28Zhou Z. Christofidou-Solomidou M. Garlanda C. DeLisser H.M. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Matrigel was diluted with cold serum-free medium to 10 mg/ml. 50 μl of the solution were added to each well of a 96-well plate and allowed to form a gel at 37 °C for 30 min. HUVEC (150,00 cells/ml) were initially incubated for 15 min with IgG or antibody in complete medium. Two hundred μl of the cell/antibody suspension (30,000 cells) were then subsequently added to each well and incubated for 6–8 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Under these conditions EC form delicate networks of tubes that are detectable within 2–3 h and are fully developed after 8–12 h. After incubation with IgG or antibody, the wells were washed and the Matrigel and its endothelial tubes fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. The total tube length per well was determined by computer-assisted image analysis with the Image-Pro Plus program (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). This model has been extensively characterized by Passaniti et al.(29Passaniti A. Taylor R.M. Pili R. Guo Y. Long P.V. Haney J.A. Pauly R.R. Grant D.S. Martin G.R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly C57Bl/6 mice were injected subcutaneously with 0.5 ml of Matrigel supplemented with bFGF (500 ng/ml) to induce the growth of vessels into the gel. There were three experimental groups: IgG, antiCD44 (KM81), and anti-RHAMM (R36). For each, the following amounts of IgG or antibody were added to the Matrigel plugs: IgG and KM81, 200 μg; R36, 500 μg. Animals were then injected with IgG (200 μg), KM81 (200 μg), or R36 (400 μg) daily via the intraperitoneal route for 5 days. The dosing of the antibodies was based on previous studies (28Zhou Z. Christofidou-Solomidou M. Garlanda C. DeLisser H.M. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and reflected concentrations of each antibody that result in saturable binding to murine EC by FACS analysis (data not shown). After 5 days, the animals were sacrificed and the gels processed for hemoglobin analysis. Differences among groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. When statistically significant differences were found (p < 0.05), individual comparisons were made using the Bonferroni/Dunn test. Although CD44 is present on endothelial cells (17Trochon V.

Selzer M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27641-27649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Endothelial surface expression of these receptors was therefore assessed initially by immunofluorescence staining of human skin (neonatal foreskin) using the J-173 and R36 antibodies against CD44 (17Trochon V. Mabilat C. Bertrand P. Legrand Y. Smadja-Joffe F. Soria C. Delpech B. Lu H. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and RHAMM (22Savani R.C. Wang C. Yang B. Zhang S. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Stern R. Nance D.M. Turley E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1158-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), respectively. Antibodies against RHAMM and CD44 not only stained the smooth muscle of the dermis and the vessel wall, but both were also noted to bind to the vascular endothelium as identified by PECAM-1 (Fig. 1,A–F). Surface expression of RHAMM and CD44 on cultured HUVEC was subsequently demonstrated with these antibodies by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1, G–I) and by FACS analysis (Fig. 2A). The presence of RHAMM on the cell surface of HUVEC was further confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-RHAMM antibody that demonstrated the presence of RHAMM (∼80 kDa) in membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear fractions of HUVEC cell lysates (Fig. 2B). Further, the binding of biotinylated HA to HUVEC was inhibited by the either anti-CD44 or anti-RHAMM antibody (Fig. 2C).Figure 2Expression of HA-binding receptors on EC and their binding of biotinylated HA. A, the expression of PECAM-1, RHAMM, and CD44 on HUVEC and H5V was assessed by FACS analysis. The following antibodies were used: anti-human PECAM-1 (4G6), anti-murine PECAM-1 (390), anti-human CD44 (J-173), anti-murine CD44 (KM81), and anti-RHAMM (R36). Filled and unfilled tracings represent the background staining and staining for the antibodies, respectively. The HUVEC and H5V lines were recognized by the species-specific PECAM-1 antibodies (a andd). Antibody J-173 bound to HUVEC (b), whereas KM81 bound to the H5V line (e). R36 bound to both cell lines (c and f). B, endothelial cell lysates were partitioned into nuclear (N), cytoplasmic (C), and membrane (M) fractions and then blotted with anti-RHAMM antibody. RHAMM (∼80 kDa) was detected in all three fractions. C, the binding in solution of biotinylated HA to HUVEC in the absence or presence of anti-RHAMM or anti-CD44 antibody was determined by FACS analysis. The binding of biotinylated HA to HUVEC, as assessed by the mean fluorescence intensity, was reduced by both antibodies. Data are representative of two experiments in which similar results were obtained.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A number of important aspects of EC function relevant to angiogenesis including cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation are regulated in part by endothelial adhesive interactions with the ECM (30Brooks P.C.

Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of anti-RHAMM and anti-CD44 antibodies on the adhesion of cultured EC to plastic surfaces coated with HA. Although both antibodies inhibited the binding of biotinylated HA to EC in solution (Fig. 2C), antibody against CD44 (20 μg/ml), but not RHAMM (300 μg/ml), inhibited EC adhesion to HA immobilized on plastic (Fig.3A). This suggests that EC adhesion to HA is largely mediated by CD44, and not RHAMM. Antibody against CD44 (J-173) has been shown previously to inhibit EC proliferation (17Trochon V. Mabilat C. Bertrand P. Legrand Y. Smadja-Joffe F. Soria C. Delpech B. Lu H. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18Lokeshwar V.B. Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23853-23864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine if antagonism of RHAMM also had a similar effect, HUVEC were cultured for 24 h in the presence of control (anti-MHC1), anti-CD44 (J-173), or anti-RHAMM (R36) antibodies (all antibody concentrations = 100 μg/ml). Compared with cells cultured in media alone, J-173 but not R36 significantly inhibited EC proliferation (Fig. 3C), suggesting that engagement of CD44, but not RHAMM, transduces signals that trigger the proliferation of these cells. HA has been implicated in cell motility, including endothelial cell migration (17Trochon V. Mabilat C. Bertrand P. Legrand Y. Smadja-Joffe F. Soria C. Delpech B. Lu H. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of anti-RHAMM antibody on the ability of single endothelial cells to migrate through polycarbonate filters coated with Matrigel. Antibody against RHAMM, but not CD44, inhibited migration through Matrigel-coated filters in a dose-dependent manner (data shown for 100 μg/ml antibody concentration) (Fig. 3B). This inhibition is unlikely to be due to antagonism of cell-matrix adhesion, as neither antibody decreased the adhesion of EC to Matrigel-coated surfaces (Fig.3A), indicating that there are other constituents of Matrigel that allow for EC adhesion to this substrate independent of HA. These data are consistent with a role for RHAMM in the migration of EC through the matrix of the basement membrane. The differentiation and organization of EC into vascular tubes is a critical step in the process of angiogenesis, which has been reproduced in vitro by a number of models (33Mousa S.A. Mousa S.A. Angiogenesis Inhibitors and Stimulators: Potential Therapeutic Implications. 20. Lances Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2000: 1-12Google Scholar). Using a model of endothelial tube formation on Matrigel, we noted that both anti-RHAMM and anti-CD44 antibodies inhibited tube formation by HUVEC on this substrate in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4, A and B). Tube formation in the presence of control antibody (anti-MHC1) did not inhibit tube formation (data not shown). Of note, when tube formation was allowed to occur in the presence of both antibodies at concentrations that were individually not inhibitory (anti-CD44 = 5 μg/ml; anti-RHAMM = 50 μg/ml), the inhibition of tube formation was additive (Fig. 4C), suggesting that, with respect to this process, RHAMM and CD44 may act in a cooperative or synergistic fashion. The finding that various aspects of EC function required for angiogenesis were inhibited by antagonism of RHAMM or CD44 activity suggested that these two HA binding receptors might also be involved in the formation of vessels in vivo. To investigate this hypothesis, we studied the effect of anti-RHAMM (R36) and anti-murine CD44 (KM81) antibodies in a model of murine angiogenesis in which vessels form over 5 days within subcutaneously implanted Matrigel plugs containing bFGF. Non-immune IgG or antibody was incorporated in the plug and administered daily (days 0–4) via the intraperitoneal route (see “Experimental Procedures” for details on dosing). Both antibodies bound murine EC as determined by FACS analysis (Fig. 2A), and KM81 has been shown previously to be a functionally active CD44 blocking antibody (24Miyake K. Medina K.L. Hayashi S. Ono S. Hamaoka T. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 25Miyake K. Underhill C.B. Lesley J. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Compared with animals treated with KM81 or control animals treated with non-immune rabbit IgG, R36 inhibited the angiogenic response to bFGF (Fig. 5, A–D). As assessed by the hemoglobin concentration in the recovered Matrigel plugs, R36 significantly reduced the vascularization of the plugs whereas the effect of the KM81 was similar to non-immune IgG (Fig.5E). To investigate the involvement of the HA receptors, RHAMM and CD44, in blood vessel formation, the endothelial expression of these proteins was determined and the effects of antibodies against RHAMM and CD44 on EC function and in vivo angiogenesis w"

In this study, homocysteine induced programmed cell death in human umbilical vein endothelial cells as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay, DNA ladder formation, induction of caspase 3-like activity, and cleavage of procaspase 3. Homocysteine-induced cell death was specific to homocysteine, was not mediated by oxidative stress, and was mimicked by inducers of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a signal transduction pathway activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Dominant negative forms of the endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein kinases IRE1α and -β, which function as signal transducers of the UPR, prevented the activation of glucose-regulated protein 78/immunoglobulin chain-binding protein and C/EBP homologous protein/growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 in response to homocysteine. Furthermore, overexpression of the point mutants of IRE1 with defective RNase more effectively suppressed the cell death than the kinase-defective mutant. These results indicate that homocysteine induces apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by activation of the UPR and is signaled through IRE1. The studies implicate that the UPR may cause endothelial cell injury associated with severe hyperhomocysteinemia."

Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Members of this supergene family form Na+-selective ion channels (PNa/PK: 8–40), which can be blocked by amiloride (IC50, 0.2–10 μm) (2Horisberger J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 3Fyfe G.K. Quinn A. Canessa C.M. Semin. Nephrol. 1998; 18: 138-151PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the ASIC subfamily share only about 20–25% identity with the subunits of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) but show all the hallmarks of the supergene family including two hydrophobic domains, short N and C termini and a large loop containing conserved cysteines between the hydrophobic domains. Therefore, they share very likely also the topology with two transmembrane spanning domains and intracellular termini, which has been experimentally shown for ENaC subunits (4Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12981-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Canessa C.M. Merillat A.M. Rossier B.C. Am. J.

There is good evidence for ENaC that amino acids preceding the second transmembrane domain (preM2 segment) and within the second transmembrane (M2) domain form the amiloride-binding site and the selectivity filter of this channel (7Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 8Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, it is likely that the pre-M2 and M2 domains of ASICs, which show considerable homology to ENaC subunits, also form part of the outer mouth of the pore. One likely function of ASICs is the modulation of neuronal activity by extracellular pH (1Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). So far six different members of this subfamily have been cloned (ASIC1a, ASIC-β, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3, and ASIC4), which are encoded by four genes. ASIC-β and ASIC2b are splice variants of ASIC1a and ASIC2a, respectively (11Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In both variants a similar part comprising about the first third of the protein is exchanged, whereas the C-terminal two-thirds are identical. ASIC1a is expressed throughout the brain and in sensory neurons from the dorsal root ganglion (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar), whereas ASIC-β is specifically expressed in sensory neurons (12Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Both subunits form rapidly activating and completely desensitizing ion channels with activation through H+ in the physiological range (pH0.5 = 5.9–6.4). They form Na+-selective channels; ASIC1a but not ASIC-β is also permeable to Ca2+ (12Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). As big parts of these proteins including pre-M2 and M2 domains are identical, other parts of the channel protein must be involved in determining ion selectivity. Difference in Ca2+ selectivity may be a major functional difference of these splice variants and may provide a means to control Ca2+ entry pathways in sensory neurons. Here we show that ASIC-β has an unusually long N terminus; we call this new variant ASIC1b. ASIC1a and ASIC1b have similar activation and inactivation kinetics. Moreover we show that ASIC1a is characterized by a lower Ca2+ permeability than previously reported, and that a pre-M1 domain controls Ca2+ permeability of ASIC1. The properties of ASIC1a match well the properties of proton-gated channels, which had been described in isolated neurons, whereas the significance of ASIC1b remains to be established. We used conserved regions of the Mec/ENaC gene family to design PCR primers G95B-u (5′-GCCARCASCWCCACIMTSCAYGG-3′) and P153-l (5′-GAKRTTGCASABRGTSACRGCIGG-3′). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated with QuickPrepMicro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) from organ of Corti, stria vascularis, maculae, ampullae of semicircular canals, and the spiral ganglion of 3-day-old rats and reverse transcribed using SuperScript (Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany). PCR was performed for 40 cycles as follows: 94 °C for 45 s, 54 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 15 s. A 220-base pair PCR product showing homology to other members of the gene family was random primed 32P-labeled and used to screen a vestibular system-specific cDNA library. Positive clones were isolated and the longest one (V10–1I; 3.5 kilobases) was entirely sequenced on both strands (accession numberAJ309926). Using the marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed with poly(A)+ RNA from organ of Corti of 4–6-day-old rats or ampullae of 4–7-day-old mice. Primers used were ASIC1b-5′-RACE 5′-CTGGCACAGGAAGGCACCCAGTGC-3′ and for the nested PCR reaction ASIC1b-5′NRACE 5′-GCCACTGCCCATAAGGCCTGCC-3′. PCR products were subcloned using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) and sequenced. For expression studies, the entire coding sequence of ASIC1b was amplified from cDNA clone V10-1I by PCR using Expand High Fidelity (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) to yield clone ASIC1b. PCR primers were ASIC1b-5′ 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCGGGGACAGATGCCG-3′ and ASIC1b-3′ 5′-GGGGTAACCTAGCAAGCAAAGTCTTCAAAG-3′. Using terminal restriction endonuclease recognition sequences (SacI andKpnI), the PCR product was ligated in the oocyte expression vector pRSSP containing the 5′-untranslated region fromXenopus β globin and a poly(A) tail. The resulting clone was verified by sequencing. Clone ASIC1b-M3 was obtained by ligating anEcoRV/EcoRI fragment of cDNA clone V10-1I in pRSSP. In this clone the first two methionines are missing. ASIC1a was cloned from rat brain cDNA by PCR using Expand High Fidelity (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Primers had been deduced from the published sequence for ASIC1a (13Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar) and were ASIC1a-5′ 5′-CCGGAGCTCCCCTTGGCAAGGATGGAATTG-3′ and ASIC1a-3′ 5′-GGGGATCCTTAGCAGGTAAAGTCCTCAAACG-3′. Using terminal restriction sites (SacI and KpnI), the PCR product was ligated in pRSSP and entirely sequenced on both strands. Chimeric molecules between ASIC1a and ASIC1b were constructed by recombinant PCR using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Briefly, two fragments were amplified with primers containing an overlapping region, joined by recombinant PCR, digested by appropriate restriction endonucleases (chimeras C1-C6,BamHI/EcoRI; chimeras C7-C9,SacI/EcoNI; chimeras C10 and C11,SacI/Van91I), and ligated into the corresponding cDNA in the vector pRSSP. All PCR-derived fragments were entirely sequenced. Using mMessage mMachine (Ambion, Austin, TX), capped cRNA was synthesized by SP6 RNA polymerase from ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC1b-M3, and chimeric cDNA, which had been linearized bySapI. 0.1–10 ng of cRNA was injected into stage V to VI oocytes of Xenopus laevis and oocytes kept in OR-2 medium (concentrations in mm: 82.5 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.0 Na2HPO4, 5.0 HEPES, 1.0 MgCl2, 1.0 CaCl2, and 0.5 g/liter polyvinylpyrrolidone) for 1–5 days. The bath solution for two electrode voltage clamp contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 2.0 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (standard measurements) or 50 BaCl2, 2.0 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (measurements determining permeability to divalent cations). pH was either 7.4 or 5.0 and adjusted using NaOH or Ba(OH)2. For pH 5.0, HEPES was replaced by MES buffer. Rapid pH changes in the outside-out configuration were achieved by placing the patch in front of a piezo-driven double-barreled application pipette. Time constant for complete solution exchange was <2 ms. Leak currents in outside-out patches were estimated by running the fast voltage ramp also before and after activation by low pH. A mean value of both control measurements was then subtracted from the value measured during activation. Patch-pipettes contained (in mm): 140 KCl, 2.0 MgCl2, 5.0 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4; pH was adjusted using KOH. Bath solution for patch clamp experiments contained (in mm): 140 NaCl or LiCl, 2.0 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. Application solutions for bi-ionic conditions contained (in mm): 140 NaCl or LiCl or 70 CaCl2, 2.0 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2(except the 70 CaCl2 solution), and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 or 6.0. pH was adjusted using HCl, NaOH, LiOH, or Ca(OH)2. Whole cell currents were recorded with a TurboTec 01C amplifier (npi electronics, Tamm, Germany) and data analyzed using IgorPro software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Currents from outside-out patch were recorded with an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data were sampled at 0.1 ms, filtered at 1 kHz and analyzed using Igor Pro. Holding potential was −100 mV. Time constants for activation and desensitization were best fitted using a single exponential function. We analyzed measurements with Na+ as well as with Li+ in the application pipette. Permeability ratio PNa/PKwas calculated from the reversal potential using the Goldmann-Hodgkin-Katz equation: Erev = (RT/F)ln(PNa[Na+]o/PK[K+]i), where T is absolute temperature, R the gas constant, and F the Faraday constant. We considered the effect of Mg2+ in the pipette and Ca2+ in the application solution negligible.PNa/PLi was calculated from the change in reversal potential when Na+ was replaced by Li+ in the application solution (ΔErev = Erev, Na −Erev,Li = (RT/F)ln(PNa[Na+]o /PLi[Li+]o)).PNa/PCa was calculated from the change in reversal potential when Na+ was replaced by Ca2+ in the application solution using the following equation: ΔErev =Erev,Na − Erev,Ca = (RT/F)ln(PNa[Na+]o /4P′Ca[Ca2+]o) with P′Ca = PCa/(1 + eEF/RT) (14Lewis C.A. J. Physiol. 1979; 286: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Activity coefficient fi of single ions i of valence z was calculated for Na+ and Ca2+ using the equation: log10 fi = −0.509z2(I0.5/(1 +I0.5) − 0.2I) (15Favre I. Moczydlowski E. Schild L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3110-3125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The ionic strength I is defined as I = 0.5 Σci zi 2. In whole cell measurements with BaCl2 in the bath we determined the current amplitude in 10-mV steps between −30 and −100 mV. Mean of inward currents from uninjected oocytes was subtracted and reversal potentials were then calculated using a linear fit of the two current values between which current reversed its sign. Values are reported as mean ± S.D. We isolated a cDNA clone for ASIC1b from a vestibular system-specific cDNA library. This clone contains a long open reading frame of 559 amino acids. The C-terminal part of the open reading frame is identical to the sequence of ASIC1a but the first 218 amino acids are different. Thus, this clone represents a splice variant of ASIC1a. ASIC1b is identical to ASIC-β described by Chen et al. (12Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) except that our clone is 46 amino acids longer at the N terminus. ASIC1b contains three methionines, which might initiate translation (Fig. 1). The third methionine corresponds to the first methionine of ASIC1a and is the initiator methionine described by Chen et al. (12Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) for ASIC-β. Sequence alignment of ASIC1b (accession number AJ309926) and ASIC-β (accession number AJ006519) reveals that there are two frameshifts, which can fully account for the different N termini, ruling out that both are independent splice variants. Therefore, we confirmed the 5′-sequence containing the two additional upstream methionines in ASIC1b by 5′-RACE. Several RACE products corresponded well to our cDNA clone extending it by only 26 base pairs (Fig. 1). They contained all three methionines in a single frame. Moreover, RACE analysis showed that the 5′ end of ASIC1b including the first and second but not third methionine is very well conserved in mice (Fig.1). Human genomic sequences containing the gene for ASIC1 were identified by a BLAST search against the draft version of the human genome (accession number AC025154). The N terminus of ASIC1b has an uninterrupted orthologous mate on human chromosome 12. Again, the 5′ end of ASIC1b including the first methionine is well conserved. In contrast, the second methionine is replaced by a leucine and the third methionine is replaced by a lysine (Fig. 1). Although we did not verify the human sequence for ASIC1b, it suggests that the long N terminus of ASIC1b is conserved in humans. In addition, the first methionine of ASIC1b is in a good surrounding for initiation of translation (“AAGATGC” in rat and mouse). Altogether, this methionine most likely represents the initiator methionine and ASIC1b represents the real splice variant of ASIC1a. We refer to the longer form using the first in-frame methionine as ASIC1b, and to the shorter form corresponding to ASIC-β as ASIC1b-M3. In addition to the different N termini, we found a threonine instead of a serine at position 82 of ASIC-β, a difference that had previously been noticed by others (16Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). We investigated functional characteristics of ASIC1b by expression inXenopus oocytes. ASIC1b expressing oocytes show full expression of proton-gated currents only after 4–5 days, whereas ASIC1b-M3 and ASIC1a expressing oocytes show full expression already 1–2 days after injection of cRNA, suggesting differences in assembly and/or targeting to the plasma membrane. Maximal expression level was in the order of 5–20 μA at pH 6.0 for ASIC1b, and up to 50 μA for ASIC1b-M3 and ASIC1a. Since proton-gated currents, which had been described in isolated neurons, show different kinetics, we first investigated activation kinetics of ASIC1a and ASIC1b. Using outside-out patches from oocytes, channels were rapidly activated by pH 6.0 (Fig.2). Activation kinetics was well fitted by a single exponential function. No significant differences were found in the time constants of activation (τact of 5.8 ± 0.9 ms (n = 16) for ASIC1a, 9.9 ± 4.8 ms (n = 6) for ASIC1b, and 6.5 ± 0.9 ms (n = 3) for ASIC1b-M3; Fig. 2). Similarly, time constants for inactivation were virtually identical for ASIC1a (τinact = 1.15 ± 0.6 s, n = 17), ASIC1b (τinact = 1.2 ± 0.77 s,n = 9), and ASIC1b-M3 (τinact = 0.6 ± 0.2 s, n = 4). We then investigated ion selectivity under bi-ionic conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) in outside-out patches. Channels were activated by a solution of pH 6.0. After complete activation, reversal potentials were determined running a fast voltage ramp from −100 to +100 mV and back to −100 mV. As is shown in Fig.3, ASIC1b discriminates stronger between monovalent cations than ASIC1a (PNa/PK = 14.0 compared with 7.8), but most notably shows no permeability to Ca2+. Ca2+ permeability of ASIC1a is low (PNa/PCa = 18.5). We did not systematically investigate ion selectivity for ASIC1b-M3, but did not notice any major difference to ASIC1b. Most notably, we did not observe Ca2+ permeability of ASIC1b-M3. To qualitatively estimate permeability for divalent cations in whole oocytes, we used 50 mm BaCl2 in the extracellular solution and activated channels by pH 5.0. The endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− channel of oocytes is less sensitive to Ba2+, thereby reducing artifacts. As is shown in Fig. 4 a, proton-activated currents of ASIC1b expressing oocytes reversed under these conditions at −84.6 ± 3.6 mV (mean ± S.D.;n = 3), indicating that these are mainly carried by K+. Currents of ASIC1a expressing oocytes in contrast reversed at −65.0 ± 5.4 mV (n = 6), demonstrating a significant contribution of Ba2+ to the total current in ASIC1a expressing oocytes. We used this differential permeability to Ba2+ in whole oocytes to determine the amino acids that are responsible for the permeability differences between ASIC1a and ASIC1b. First, we constructed a series of chimeric channels, in which we replaced increasing parts of the N terminus of ASIC1a by the corresponding part of ASIC1b. In order to obtain high expression levels, we used the N terminus of ASIC1b-M3. Chimeras were all functional and showed current amplitude comparable to wild type ASIC1a. As is shown in Fig.5, currents through chimeras, in which up to 19 amino acids were replaced, reversed around −65 mV, indicating that they are permeable to Ba2+. A chimera, in which the first 25 amino acids were replaced, however, showed a significant shift in the reversal potential to −74.6 ± 5.8 mV (n = 3), indicating that this chimera was only poorly permeable to Ba2+. For chimeras with even more distal junctions the reversal potential took values around −85 mV like for ASIC1b, indicating that these chimeras were mainly permeable to K+. This identifies the region comprising amino acids 20–25 as being crucial for determining permeability to divalent cations. Only two amino acids in this region are different between ASIC1a and ASIC1b, highlighting their importance. Since complete shift of the reversal potential to −85 mV was only observed with chimera C5, where 43 amino acids are exchanged, permeability to divalents is, though, not controlled by a single amino acid. We did not further investigate the effect of single amino acid substitutions. Next, we made a similar series of chimeras, this time replacing increasing parts of the N terminus of ASIC1b by the corresponding part of ASIC1a. Chimera 7, in which the first 62 amino acids of ASIC1b were replaced, showed a reversal potential of −84.7 ± 2.9 mV (n = 3) like ASIC1b wild type. Chimera 9, with 88 replaced amino acids showed a reversal potential of −64.3 ± 4.0 mV (n = 6) like ASIC1a wild type. Chimera 8, in which the first 70 amino acids of ASIC1b were replaced, and chimeras more distal to amino acid 99 showed very low level of expression and were therefore not further analyzed. Thus, these chimeras identify the same pre-M1 domain as the opposite chimeras, confirming that this domain controls permeability to divalent cations in ASIC1. We cloned a splice variant of ASIC1a from inner ear. A similar variant has previously been cloned from dorsal root ganglia by Chen et al. (12Chen C.C. England S. Akopian A.N. Wood J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10240-10245Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). We provide strong evidence that this variant has a longer N terminus than previously reported, extending the sequence divergence between ASIC1a and ASIC1b. The first 17 amino acids of this long N terminus of ASIC1b show significant similarity to the N terminus of ASIC4 (almost 50% identity) (17Gründer S. Geissler H.S. Bässler E.L. Ruppersberg J.P. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). They are followed by a stretch of repetitive amino acids. Such stretches often serve as flexible hinge regions in proteins. It might thus very well be that the N terminus of ASIC1b and ASIC4 constitutes a domain with so far unknown function. As ASICs have recently been implicated in the formation of mechanosensitive ion channels (18Price M.P. Lewin G.R. McIlwrath S.L. Cheng C. Xie J. Heppenstall P.A. Stucky C.L. Mannsfeldt A.G. Brennan T.J. Drummond H.A. Qiao J. Benson C.J. Tarr D.E. Hrstka R.F. Yang B. Williamson R.A. Welsh M.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and as such channels are generally believed to be associated with the cytoskeleton, one may speculate that this domain may mediate such interactions. Sequences of ASIC2a and ASIC2b diverge at the same position as ASIC1a and 1b, suggesting that evolution of the alternative splice form had occurred before the gene doubling that gave rise to ASIC1 and -2. Various proton-gated currents, which differ with respect to their kinetics, ionic selectivity, threshold for activation by protons, and rate of recovery, have been described in isolated neurons (19Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I. Neuroscience. 1981; 6: 2599-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol. 1991; 433: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 21Konnerth A. Lux H.D. Morad M. J. Physiol. 1987; 386: 603-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Davies N.W. Lux H.D. Morad M. J. Physiol. 1988; 400: 159-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Akaike N. Krishtal O.A. Maruyama T. J. Neurophysiol. 1990; 63: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is only beginning to emerge which of the cloned receptors underlie these currents. Of the cloned ASICs, ASIC2a is characterized by pH activation only in an unphysiologic range (24Champigny G. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15418-15422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and ASIC2b and ASIC4 are inactive by itself (11Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29778-29783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 17Gründer S. Geissler H.S. Bässler E.L. Ruppersberg J.P. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, if these subunits contribute to the formation of proton-gated channels, they will do so only through the formation of heteromeric channels with other ASIC subunits. Recently, detailed investigation of the properties of ASIC3 showed that this receptor underlies the proton-gated current in cardiac afferents (16Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This current is characterized by a fast kinetics (τact, <5 ms; τinact, 0.32 s) and very low Ca2+ permeability (PNa/PCa > 100). Moreover, ASIC3 is more sensitive to protons than ASIC1a or ASIC1b (16Sutherland S.P. Benson C.J. Adelman J.P. McCleskey E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). pH activation of ASIC1a and ASIC1b, though, resembles that of ASIC3. Our study suggests that ASIC1a as well as ASIC1b have slower inactivation kinetics than ASIC3. In one of the initial studies by Krishtal and Pidoplichko (19Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I. Neuroscience. 1981; 6: 2599-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), 25 neurons out of 67 isolated from the trigeminal ganglion showed a fast and completely desensitizing proton-gated current (τinact, 0.5–1 s), 2 neurons showed slower desensitizing currents (τinact, 3–4 s), and 5 neurons showed slowly and incompletely desensitizing currents. Later it was shown that the completely desensitizing current includes a Ca2+ component (PNa/PCa ≈ 3) (25Kovalchuk Yu N. Krishtal O.A. Nowycky M.C. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 115: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although these data do not exactly match the properties of any recombinant ASIC, they suggest that channels formed by ASIC1a underlie some of the native currents in sensory neurons. Proton-gated currents (threshold of current activation, pH 6.5) described in hypothalamic neurons show a kinetic very similar to ASIC1 (τact, 6.48 ms; τinact, 1.28 s) (26Ueno S. Nakaye T. Akaike N. J. Physiol. 1992; 447: 309-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Since ASIC1b and ASIC3 are not significantly expressed in the central nervous system this suggests that ASIC1a underlies this current. More recently it has been found that similar channels in mouse cortical neurons have no significant Ca2+ component and show a large cell-to-cell variation with respect to half-effective proton concentration (27Varming T. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This shows that proton-gated currents are heterogeneous also in central neurons. Ca2+ permeability of ASIC1a is low (PNa/PCa = 18.5). Given that the extracellular Ca2+ concentration is much lower than the Na+ concentration, Ca2+ in-flow through ASIC1a will be very small under physiological conditions and will probably not lead to significant rise in intracellular [Ca2+]. It is therefore questionable whether the rather small difference in ion permeability between ASIC1a and ASIC1b will be of physiological significance. Also time constants of activation or inactivation show only minor differences between the two splice variants. As synaptic transmission takes place in a few milliseconds, small differences in activation time constants as observed for ASIC1a and ASIC1b will not be of functional significance. Together, the significance of ASIC1b cannot be explained by its functional properties. It thus may constitute a component of a heteromeric channel. Since the pore structure of ASICs and related channels is much less understood than that of other channel types, we addressed the structural basis for the observed difference in permeability for divalent cations. The pore structure of the related ENaC has been elucidated in some detail by detailed analysis of targeted mutations. This has identified amino acids in the pre-M2 and M2 segment as being important for block by amiloride (7Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and formation of the selectivity filter (8Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Kellenberger S. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The corresponding amino acids are conserved in ASICs, suggesting that the overall pore geometry is similar. ENaC, though, is impermeable to Ca2+ and shows only a very low permeability to K+(PNa/PK > 40). Moreover, pre-M2 and M2 domains are identical between ASIC1a and ASIC1b and cannot account for the differences in ionic selectivity between these splice variants. For ASIC2a and ASIC2b, which are also identical in their C terminus including pre-M2 and M2, but which show different permeability ratiosPNa/PK, the difference in ion selectivity could be attributed to a short stretch of amino acids preceding the first transmembrane domain M1 (pre-M1 domain) (28Coscoy S. de Weille J.R. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10129-10132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the same pre-M1 domain controls Ca2+ permeability of ASIC1. Strikingly, mutations of the pre-M1 segment in ENaC do not change ionic selectivity but, rather, change the gating pattern of this channel leading to a gating mode characterized by a low Po (29Gründer S. Firsov D. Chang S.S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 30Gründer S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 438: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Several models can be envisaged to explain the role of the pre-M1 domain. The outer vestibule of the ion pore is very likely formed by the pre-M2 domain (7Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and the selectivity filter by amino acids in the M2 domain (8Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Schild L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 9Kellenberger S. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The pre-M1 domain could form part of the inner mouth of the ion pore. In ENaC, the size of this inner mouth could be significantly larger compared with that of its selectivity filter, which would explain why mutations in this region do not change ionic selectivity in ENaC. In ASICs, however, this region may contribute to the selectivity filter. In a second model, based on the observation that mutations at the pre-M1 domain of ENaC have an effect primarily on the gating of this channel (29Gründer S. Firsov D. Chang S.S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 30Gründer S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 438: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the pre-M1 domain of ASICs could also be involved in gating. In this model the pre-M1 domain would have an indirect effect on ion selectivity and would not line the ion pore. There are some observations, which speak in favor of such a model: (i) not a single amino acid controls Ca2+permeability as may be expected for a Ca2+-binding site within the pore, and (ii) the pre-M1 segment is most likely situated distal to the selectivity filter, which is located around halfway of the M2 segment. It is difficult to imagine how a region distal of the selectivity filter may directly control ion permeation. A deeper understanding of the contribution of the pre-M1 domain to the pore of this ion channel family will rely on characterizing the structure of the inner mouth of the ion pore, for example, using inside-out patches. The conformation of the open pore may not be fixed for ASICs. Conformational changes in the outer vestibule of the open pore have already been demonstrated for ASIC2 (31Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and ENaC (32Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ASIC3/ASIC2b heteromer shows a dynamic selectivity filter (11Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F.

Thus it seems possible that regions, which do not directly line the ion pore, control ion selectivity of a channel by controlling the conformation the pore adopts. Although such a model is hypothetical at the moment, it seems clear that the pore structure of ASICs and probably ENaC is more complicated than previously anticipated. We thank A.

We have used an in vitro wound healing migration model and newly generated anti-membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to characterize the role of MT1-MMP during this process. First, the expression and shedding of MT1-MMP are up-regulated upon induction of migration in endothelial cells, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, MT1-MMP is concentrated at discrete areas in migrating endothelial cells, in contrast to the diffuse pattern observed in confluent cells. Interestingly, migration of endothelial cells results in the stimulation of MT1-MMP activity, as shown by its ability to process pro-MMP-2 and to degrade fibrinogen assessed by zymography. Moreover, MT1-MMP-mediated gelatin degradation is enriched at migration sites. mAbs generated against the MT1-MMP catalytic domain are shown to inhibit MT1-MMP enzymatic activity and to impair both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced endothelial migration and invasion of collagen and fibrin gels. Furthermore, a reduction in the formation of capillary tubes in Matrigel is also observed when endothelial cells are pretreated with the blocking anti-MT1-MMP mAbs. Altogether, these data demonstrate that MT1-MMP plays an important role during endothelial cell migration, and its activity can modulate endothelial migration, invasion, and formation of capillary tubes during the angiogenic response.

Endothelial cells are normally quiescent and form a tight monolayer by interacting with the extracellular matrix beneath and with surrounding endothelial cells (1Bazzoni G. Dejana E. Lampugnani M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, this situation is broken during the angiogenic response,i.e. the formation of new vessels from preexisting capillaries. Angiogenesis is critical for different physiologic and pathologic processes including wound healing, tissue remodeling, chronic inflammatory diseases, and tumorigenesis (2Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7284) Google Scholar). During angiogenesis, endothelial cells go through several steps including the loosening of matrix and intercellular adhesion, degradation of subendothelial matrix, migration, proliferation, and formation of new tubes (3Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4755) Google Scholar). The receptors likely involved in one of the first critical steps, endothelial migration, are not well characterized yet. However, it is known that αvβ3 localizes at the tip of growing vessel sprouts and at the lamellipodia of migrating endothelial cells (4Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 5Kiosses W.B. Shattil S.J. Pampori N. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). α3β1 integrin/tetraspanin complexes also play an important role in regulating endothelial motility, and in angiotensin-induced angiogenesis (6Yáñez-Mó M. Alfranca A. Cabañas C. Marazuela M. Tejedor R. Ursa M.A. Ashman L.K. de Landázuri M.O. Sánchez-Madrid F. J.

He C.Z. Al-Barazi H. Krutzsch H.C. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Roberts D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2885-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The advancing front of the migrating endothelial cells presumably focuses proteolytic activity to create a defect in the vascular basement membrane, and this degradation is associated with migration of endothelial cells out of the vascular channel toward the angiogenic stimulus (9Kalebic T. Garbisa S. Glaser B. Liotta L.A. Science. 1983; 221: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 10Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). During this process, the subendothelial basement membrane, a dense meshwork of collagen, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, must be proteolytically disrupted to allow formation of new capillaries (11Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Migrating endothelial cells elaborate a battery of enzymes that mainly belong to the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1 family to degrade this extracellular matrix (ECM) (10Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). MMPs are multidomain zinc-dependent endopeptidases that, with a few exceptions, share a basic structural organization comprising a propeptidic, catalytic, hinge, and hemopexin-like domains and that have been largely involved in tissue remodeling and tumor invasion (12Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3827) Google Scholar). Although most MMPs are secreted, a subfamily of MMPs associated to the cell membrane has recently been described, with membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) the first member characterized (13Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar). Its catalytic activity includes ECM components such as fibronectin, laminin, collagens, gelatin, vitronectin, and others (14Pei D. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar,15Ohuchi E. Imai K. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. J. Biol.

Its localization makes this protein particularly suited to function in pericellular proteolysis (16Hiraoka N. Allen E. Apel I.J. Gyetko M.R. Weiss S.J.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3827) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that MT1-MMP serves as activator of pro-MMP-13 (18Knauper V. Will H. López-Otı́n C. Smith B. Atkinson S.J. Stanton H. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. J. Biol.

However, recent reports have shown that MT1-MMP might play a role during migration of glioma and epithelial cells independently of MMP-2 activation (22Beliën A.T.J. Paganetti P.A. Schwab M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 23Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The role that MT1-MMP plays during endothelial cell motility has not been characterized yet. However, different studies suggest that MT1-MMP might be important in the physiology of the endothelium. Thus, it acts as the most potent fibrinolysin in endothelial cells (16Hiraoka N. Allen E. Apel I.J. Gyetko M.R. Weiss S.J. Cell. 1998; 95: 365-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice deficient in MT1-MMP display defects in cartilage maturation likely due to both defects in collagen turnover and in vascularization at these sites, and they also exhibit a hampered response to angiogenic factors in the mouse corneal model (24Holmbeck K. Bianco P. Caterina J. Yamada S. Kromer M. Kuznetsov S.A. Mankani M. Robey P.G. Poole A.R. Pidoux I. Ward J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H.

These reports demonstrate that MT1-MMP participates in the angiogenic response, but the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. Herein, we have characterized the role that MT1-MMP plays during the migration of human endothelial cells and its putative relevance for the angiogenic process. BALB/c mice were immunized with the peptides REVPYAYIREGHEK (LEM-1) and the modified CAEPWTVRNEDLNGNDIC (LEM-2) located within two exposed loops of the MT1-MMP catalytic domain (19Fernández-Catalán C.

Hybridoma culture supernatants were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the immunogenic peptides. The specificity of these mAbs was confirmed by analysis of COS-1 cells transfected with the MT1-MMP cDNA by electroporation. LEM-2/15, LEM-2/63, and LEM-1/58 mAbs are IgG1,κ, IgG2b,κ, and IgG2a,κ, respectively. mAbs were purified from ascitic fluid by affinity chromatography on a protein-A-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). mAbs, anti-β1integrins TS2/16 (26Arroyo A.G.

The monoclonal Ig (IgG1,κ) from the P3X63 myeloma cell line was used as negative control. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Human endothelial cells from umbilical vein (HUVEC) were obtained as described previously (26Arroyo A.G. Sánchez-Mateos P. Campanero M.R. Martı́n-Padura I. Dejana E. Sánchez-Madrid F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded on tissue culture dishes coated with 0.5% gelatin and grown in 199 medium from Bio Whittaker (Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone. After the first passage, cells were supplemented with 50 μg/ml growth supplement prepared from bovine brain and 100 μg/ml heparin. Cells up to the third passage were used in all the assays. Endothelial cells were detached with PBS plus 5 mm EDTA on ice, washed, and resuspended in PBS. Approximately 2 × 105 cells were incubated with 100 μl of hybridoma culture supernatant for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with 100 μl of the proper dilution of a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig. Finally, fluorescent samples were analyzed in a FACSCalibur® flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ). HUVEC were stimulated to migrate by disrupting the monolayer with 3 by 3 injuries, 20 ng/ml PMA, or both. Culture supernatants were collected, filtered in 0.22-μm pore Spin-X microtubes (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA), and mixed with 2× cold Laemmli buffer. Cells were washed twice with PBS and directly lysed in Laemmli buffer on ice. Lysates and supernatants were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Pierce). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk or bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with anti-MT1-MMP LEM-2/15 mAb culture supernatant, and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). HUVEC were grown on glass coverslips coated with 1% gelatin to confluence. Then, they were stimulated to migrate by disrupting the monolayer with 3 by 3 injuries, 20 ng/ml PMA, or both. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde plus 2% sacarose in PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. Then, nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with TNB (0.5% blocking reagent; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) for 30 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were first incubated with the primary antibodies, and then labeled simultaneously with a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Serotec, Oxford, United Kingdom) and Texas Red-phalloidin (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Samples were examined in a Leica DMR photomicroscope with a 63× oil immersion objective, and images were recorded using a CCD camera from Leica. HUVEC were changed to serum-free medium (HE-SFM; Life Technologies GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) 24 h prior to the assay. HUVEC were then stimulated to migrate by disrupting the monolayer with 3 by 3 injuries, 20 ng/ml PMA, or both. Lysates and supernatants, prepared as described for Western blot analysis, were then resolved under nonreducing conditions on 9% SDS-PAGE gels embedded with 1 mg/ml gelatin or fibrinogen (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Co., Darmstadt, Germany). Gels were rinsed three times in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, and 200 mm NaCl for 12 h at 37 °C. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and areas of gelatinolytic or fibrinolytic activity were visualized as transparent bands. To test the effect of the anti-MT1-MMP mAbs, HUVEC were preincubated with the different mAbs before stimulation, and cell lysates were analyzed by zymography as described. Gelatin was coupled to FITC by incubation with a freshly prepared solution of FITC at 1 mg/ml for 1 h at 4 °C in a 0.25 mcarbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The reaction mixture was filtered in a G25-Sephadex column from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. HUVEC were grown on coverslips coated with FITC-gelatin (cross-linked by fixing with 0.5% glutaraldehyde), stimulated by wounding with 3 by 3 injuries, 20 ng/ml PMA, or both, and then fixed and stained with Texas Red phalloidin. For inhibition experiments, HUVEC on FITC-gelatin were pretreated with different mAbs before stimulation and then processed as described. MT1-MMP recombinant catalytic domain (0.05 μg) from Calbiochem was incubated with 10 μg of fibrinogen in 20 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 12 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of different mAbs, or 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. Samples were analyzed under reducing conditions by 10% SDS-PAGE. HUVEC were grown to confluence on gelatin-coated 24-well plates. Cells were changed to serum-free medium 24 h prior to the assay. Cells were preincubated with different purified mAbs 30 min before the injury. The monolayer was then stimulated with 20 ng/ml PMA, disrupted with a cell scraper of ∼1 mm, and filmed at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h in a phase contrast videomicroscope (Nikon ELWD 0.3) with a 10× objective. Experiments were done in duplicate, and four fields of each well were recorded. Migrated area was calculated by subtracting the area in μm2 between the wound edges at different time points from the area measured at time 0. HUVEC transmigration assays were performed in 8-μm pore Transwell chambers (Costar Corp.). Cells were resuspended in serum-free medium plus 20 ng/ml PMA and seeded at 15,000 cells/well on gelatin-coated filters in the absence or presence of different purified mAbs on the upper chamber. Transmigrated cells onto the lower surface of the filter were stained with toluidine blue and counted after 8 h of migration. Experiments were done in duplicate, and four fields of each transwell were counted with a 40× objective in an Eclipse E400 microscope (Nikon). Collagen or fibrin gels were prepared by diluting type I collagen (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) in 199 medium to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml or by adding 0.1 units of thrombin to a 3 mg/ml fibrinogen solution in 199 medium, respectively. Then, 500 μl of each solution were dispensed in 24-well plates and allowed to solidify for 1 h at 37 °C. HUVEC were grown to confluence in serum-free medium on top of type I collagen or fibrin gels. Cells were then stimulated with 20 ng/ml PMA (29Montesano R. Orci L. Cell. 1985; 42: 469-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and incubated for 24 h in the absence or presence of different purified mAbs. Invasive cells (dendritic shaped cells, whose plane of focus was beneath the surface monolayer) were counted in four 10× randomly selected fields on a phase contrast videomicroscope (Nikon ELWD 0.3). Experiments were performed in duplicate. Matrigel basement membrane matrix (Becton Dickinson) was diluted 1:2 in cold 199 medium. Diluted Matrigel (80 μl) was plated into flat-bottomed 96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to gel for 20 min at 37 °C before cell seeding. Then, 4 × 104 cells were added atop the Matrigel in the absence or presence of different purified mAbs. After 8 h of incubation, images were taken on TMAX 400 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with a phase contrast microscope (Nikon ELWD 0.3) using a 4× objective. Capillary tubes were defined as cellular extensions linking cell masses or branch points. Experiments were done in duplicate. Densitometric analysis was performed on scanned images with the Multi-Analyst software from Bio-Rad. Tested and control samples in the functional assays were compared for statistical significance by using Student's t test. To analyze the role that MT1-MMP might have during endothelial cell migration, a wound healing migration model was used. For this purpose, novel mAbs against the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP were generated and their specificity assessed by both flow cytometry and Western blot analysis of MT1-MMP-transiently transfected COS-1 cells (Fig.1A). MT1-MMP expression was then analyzed on the surface of endothelial cells under different migratory stimuli by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1B, basal expression of MT1-MMP on resting confluent endothelial cells increased when cells were stimulated to migrate by wound healing, whereas no significant changes in the expression of other endothelial receptors like PECAM-1 were observed under the same conditions (data not shown). The increase is similar to that obtained on cells stimulated with PMA or tumor necrosis factor-α (Fig. 1B, and data not shown). Stimulation of endothelial cells with both the wound and PMA usually resulted in an additive effect (Fig. 1B). The kinetics of the up-regulation of MT1-MMP expression by wound healing started at ∼6 h, and it was more consistently observed 24 h after stimulation (Fig. 1B). Moreover, MT1-MMP wound-induced up-regulation depended on de novo protein synthesis, since it was largely prevented in the presence of cycloheximide as it happened with PMA-induced increased expression (Fig. 1B). The effect of migration in MT1-MMP expression was also analyzed by Western blot of endothelial cell lysates. As shown in Fig.1C, mature MT1-MMP (60 kDa) was up-regulated ∼2-fold in response to the injury at 6 and 24 h. This increase in expression was greater upon stimulation with either PMA or a combination of both stimuli. Interestingly, a major MT1-MMP soluble form of 53 kDa was detected in the supernatant of endothelial cells stimulated to migrate with wound healing, PMA, or both for 6 or 24 h compared with quiescent cells, in which it was barely observed, suggesting an induction of MT1-MMP shedding under these conditions (Fig.1C). All these data show that endothelial cell response to injury includes the induction of MT1-MMP synthesis, resulting in an increase of MT1-MMP expression on the cell membrane as well as in the supernatant, and suggest that MT1-MMP might be playing a role in the cell migration associated to wound healing. We next investigated the localization of MT1-MMP in endothelial cells that are migrating during wound repair. As shown in Fig. 2, cells migrating to repair the wound acquired a migratory phenotype with an expansion of lamellipodia and cytoplasmic projections in contrast to the polygonal shape of cells within the confluent monolayer. By immunofluorescence, MT1-MMP was observed as a diffuse staining on confluent quiescent endothelium (Fig. 2). However, 6 h after the monolayer was injured, a variable but consistent percentage of migratory endothelial cells within or nearby the wound concentrated MT1-MMP at discrete areas along their motility-associated structures and different staining patterns were observed among these migrating cells. (Fig. 2). This clustered staining was never observed in confluent quiescent endothelium but it was also present in sparse, unstimulated endothelial cells (data not shown). The relocalization of MT1-MMP was even more evident when endothelial cells were stimulated to migrate with a combination of an injury and PMA (Fig. 2). This pattern was noticeable as early as 6 h, and it persisted up to 24 h after wound induction of migration (data not shown). Moreover, filamentous actin also seemed to be rearranged at the MT1-MMP-enriched areas (Fig. 2), suggesting that relocalization might be related to cytoskeletal interactions. The localization of MT1-MMP at sites of active endothelial migration suggested a function for this protease during endothelial motility. One of the most relevant catalytic activities of MT1-MMP is the processing of pro-MMP-2 (pro-gelatinase A) to MMP-2 (13Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2361) Google Scholar). In our model, activation of MMP-2 during endothelial migration was analyzed by gelatin zymography. The 62-kDa active form of MMP-2 was induced in the cell lysate and usually in the culture supernatant of endothelial cells stimulated to migrate by wound healing for 6 or 24 h (Fig.3, A and C, and data not shown). The intrinsic enzymatic activity of MT1-MMP was also analyzed by zymography of fibrinogen-embedded gels. Endothelial cells stimulated to migrate during 6 or 24 h degraded fibrinogen more efficiently than resting endothelial cells similarly to the effect of PMA (Fig. 3, B and D, and not shown). In both cases, the induction was more clearly observed in the cell lysates according to the anchorage of MT1-MMP to the membrane and an additive effect in MT1-MMP activation was usually observed when both the wound and PMA were used in combination (Fig. 3, A andB). The molecular masses of the proteolytic activities detected in fibrinogen-embedded gels were 60 kDa for the lysate and 53 kDa for the supernatant, which correlated with the MT1-MMP species revealed on endothelial cells by Western blot (see Fig. 1C). The activation of pro-MMP-2 as well as the fibrinogen degradation induced by injuring were partially dependent on the increase in MT1-MMP expression since they were largely inhibited in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 3, C and D). However, a faint proteolytic activity remained, suggesting that other factors such as relocalization of MT1-MMP might also be playing a role in MT1-MMP activation. To investigate whether relocalized MT1-MMP to the motility-associated structures of migrating endothelial cells might be related to MMP-2 (gelatinase A) activation and to migration of endothelial cells, we analyzed the in situ gelatinolytic activity in the wound healing model. Endothelial cells were grown on fluorescein-labeled gelatin, and degradation of this matrix was tested upon stimulation with different migratory stimuli. In confluent quiescent endothelial cells, degradation areas were barely observed (Fig.4A). However, an increase in gelatin degradation was detected in areas nearby the wound where endothelial cells were actively migrating to repair the injury (Fig.4A). This effect was more noticeable when endothelial cells were stimulated with both the wound and PMA for 6 or 24 h (Fig.4A, and data not shown). Altogether, these data demonstrate that migration of endothelial cells induced the activity of MT1-MMP and subsequently of MMP-2 in areas nearby the wound, suggesting that this proteolytic activity might be directly involved in the migration process. The enrichment of gelatinolytic areas around migratory sites suggested a relation between proteolysis and endothelial migration. We therefore tested the ability of the anti-MT1-MMP mAbs generated against the catalytic domain to modulate MT1-MMP activity. As shown in Fig.5A, anti-MT1-MMP mAbs LEM-2/15, LEM-2/63, and LEM-1/58 inhibited by an average of 34, 41, and 85% pro-MMP-2 processing and by an average of 20, 40, and 75% fibrinogen degradation induced by wounding and PMA on endothelial cells, compared with no effect of the control anti-VE-cadherin TEA1/31 mAb. Furthermore, the anti-MT1-MMP LEM-1/58 mAb largely prevented the induction of gelatinolytic areas around the wound compared with no effect of the same control mAb (Fig. 4B, and data not shown). To determine whether the inhibitory effect was directly exerted on the MT1-MMP catalytic activity, the anti-MT1-MMP mAbs were tested in enzymatic assays using the recombinant catalytic domain of MT1-MMP. As shown in Fig. 5B, the anti-MT1-MMP mAbs LEM-2/15, LEM-2/63, and LEM-1/58 significantly decreased the degradation of the Aα and Bβ chains of fibrinogen (by 50 and 87% for LEM-2/15, 30 and 90% for LEM-2/63, and 75 and 99% for LEM-1/58, respectively) compared with no effect of the control mAb anti-β1 integrins TS2/16. These data demonstrate that the anti-MT1-MMP mAbs directly interfered with the enzymatic activity of the metalloproteinase, constituting very useful tools to investigate the role of MT1-MMP proteolytic activity during distinct cellular processes. The role of MT1-MMP-activity in endothelial cell motility was directly assessed using the inhibitory anti-MT1-MMP mAbs in different migration assays. As shown in Fig.6A, anti-MT1-MMP mAbs LEM-2/15, LEM-2/63, and LEM-1/58 consistently retarded the kinetics of migration and subsequent repair of the wound in PMA-treated endothelial cells by an average of 22, 24, and 35% at 8 h, respectively. The role of MT1-MMP in endothelial cell migration was also determined by using transwell chamber assays. Again, PMA-induced transmigration of human endothelial cells through gelatin-coated filters was consistently inhibited by anti-MT1-MMP mAbs LEM-2/15, LEM-2/63, and LEM-1/58 by an average of 30, 27, and 47%, respectively (Fig. 6B).

We report here that c-Cbl also mediates the ubiquitination of another protooncogene, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src, as well as of itself. The c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination of Src and c-Cbl requires c-Cbl's RING finger, Src kinase activity, and c-Cbl's tyrosine phosphorylation, probably on Tyr-371. In vitro, c-Cbl forms a stable complex with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7, but active Src destabilizes this interaction. In contrast, Src inhibition stabilizes the c-Cbl· UbcH7·Src complex. Finally, c-Cbl reduces v-Src protein levels and suppresses v-Src-induced STAT3 activation. Thus, in addition to mediating the ubiquitination of activated receptor tyrosine kinases, c-Cbl also acts as a ubiquitin ligase for the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src, thereby down-regulating Src.

The domains of c-Cbl that are most directly involved in the ubiquitination process are the RING domain (17Tyers M. Willems A.R. Science. 1999; 284: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and a linker region that lies between the RING domain and the N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain (also termed tyrosine kinase binding or TKB domain 2We prefer the term PTB, which indicates that it binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues. The term TKB fails to confer that information and also suggests that this domain binds to all or only to tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, as shown here for Src, Cbl can bind to tyrosine kinases through domains other than the TKB. ) (16Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R.

Deletion of all or part of these residues, as in the oncogenic v-Cbl and 70Z-Cbl, abolishes the ability of c-Cbl to mediate ubiquitination of growth factor receptors, generating dominant negative versions of c-Cbl (17Tyers M. Willems A.R. Science. 1999; 284: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Crystal structure analysis of the evolutionarily conserved N-terminal half of the c-Cbl molecule revealed that the PTB domain comprises three subdomains: a four-helix bundle, an EF-hand, and a divergent SH2 domain, all of which contribute residues necessary for the binding of phosphotyrosine-containing target proteins (21Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The C-terminal-half of c-Cbl has a proline-rich region and several tyrosines, which are phosphorylated in response to various stimuli, as well as a leucine zipper domain that mediates the formation of c-Cbl homodimers (22Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As yet, there is no evidence that the C-terminal domains play a role in the ubiquitination-related function of c-Cbl. The ubiquitin system, in which the recruitment of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) to specific proteins leads to their subsequent ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome, selectively terminates the activity of many proteins in cells (23Weissman A.M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 25Hershko A.

This pathway generally involves the sequential action of three types of molecules: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). We and others (10Joazeiro C.A.P. Wing S.S. Huang H.-K. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.-C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 12Levkowitz G. Waterman H.

It is not known if c-Cbl also plays a more active role in the actual transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to the receptor. Thus, it is becoming clear that the molecular mechanism by which c-Cbl exerts its negative regulation of RTKs involves both direct binding to the activated receptor via c-Cbl's PTB domain and the recruitment of the ubiquitin system via the RING finger. c-Cbl is, however, known to bind to numerous other proteins (20Thien C.B.F. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 28Miyake S. Lupher M.L. Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Ota S. Douillard P. Rao N. Band H. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 189-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and, of particular interest here, it is also a negative regulator of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (29van Leeuwen J.E.M. Paik P.K. Samelson L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6652-6664Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,30Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The Src family of tyrosine kinases is involved in a variety of cellular signaling pathways, leading to the induction of DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and cytoskeletal reorganization (31Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 32Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Src tyrosine kinase activity is tightly regulated, and its dysregulation leads to constitutive activation and cellular transformation. Src kinase activity is regulated by the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of a specific tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail (tyrosine 527 in avian c-Src), which binds intramolecularly to the SH2 domain, as well as via an interaction between the SH3 domain and the linker region that connects the SH2 and kinase domains (34Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 35Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of tyrosine 527 leads to the release of the intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain and the consequent activation of Src. Reciprocally, phosphorylation of tyrosine 527 by cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases such as CSK allows re-binding of phosphorylated tyrosine 527 to Src SH2, favoring the inactive conformation (36Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 37Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Src activity can also be regulated by intermolecular interactions. The binding of other proteins to Src's SH2 or SH3 domains favors the open, active conformation of Src (35Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), although the proteins that bind to the Src domains could then inhibit Src by some other mechanism. For example, we have recently shown that the binding of the c-Cbl proline-rich region to the Src SH3 domain, which may initially promote Src activation, also leads to the inhibition of Src kinase activity via the direct interaction between the c-Cbl PTB domain and Src phosphotyrosine 416, the autophosphorylated tyrosine in the activation loop of the kinase domain (30Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Finally, recent studies have shown that Src kinase activity can also be down-regulated by ubiquitin-dependent degradation (38Hakak Y. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 39Harris K.F. Shoji I. Cooper E.M. Kumar S. Oda H. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13738-13743Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but the possible role of c-Cbl in this process has not been explored. Given that Cbl is known to interact with Src (30Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 40Tanaka S.

Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and is capable of recruiting the ubiquitin system to specific substrates (10Joazeiro C.A.P. Wing S.S. Huang H.-K. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.-C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar,12Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that, like the RTKs, Src's interaction with c-Cbl may lead to its ubiquitination. In this report, we show that c-Cbl acts as an E3 for Src and that their interaction leads to the ubiquitination not only of active Src but also of c-Cbl itself. Furthermore, we found that the phosphorylation of c-Cbl by Src is necessary for the ubiquitination of both Src and c-Cbl. Thus, activation of Src also activates the machinery responsible for its own c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination as well as the ubiquitination of c-Cbl itself, presumably leading to the degradation of both proteins. Antibodies to c-Cbl and UbcH7 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Src and avian-specific anti-Src antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Anti-histidine antibodies were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99), anti-c-Myc (clone 9E10) and anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) (clone B-14) antibodies were obtained Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were obtained from Fisher Scientific. Src−/− fibroblasts and NIH3T3 cell lines stably expressing the avian c-Src, avian Src Y416F/Y527F, and avian Src Y527F were kind gifts from Dr. P. Schwartzberg (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). To obtain the stable transformants of c-Src K295M/Y527F, a retroviral vector encoding avian-Src K295M/Y527F was generated by subcloning theBamHI-SalI fragment into the pBabe vector (also a gift from Dr. P. Schwartzberg). The plasmid was introduced into NIH3T3 cells using retroviral infection, and stable transformants were selected with 1.0 μg/ml puromycin. All cell lines were maintained in minimal essential medium, with α-modification containing 10% fetal calf serum. c-Cbl (codon 2–906) and 70Z-Cbl (codon 2–906, lacking 366–382) were subcloned into His-tagged pBluebacHis2 vector (Invitrogen) in-frame, and the proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells by using BaculoGold baculovirus DNA (PharMingen). c-Cbl mutants c-Cbl G306E and c-Cbl Y371F were created by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit obtained from Stratagene) using pcDNA3.1-c-Cbl as template. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing and then subcloned into the pBluebacHis2 vector. Wild type avian Src was subcloned into pVL1393 vector (PharMingen). Standard procedures were used for the recombinant DNA manipulations (42Sambrooke J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1989Google Scholar, 43). The myc-tagged c-Cbl mutants have been previously described (22Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were transfected with c-Cbl and Src constructs according to the manufacturer's protocol (PharMingen). Cells expressing c-Cbl and mutant Cbl proteins were washed twice with PBS and incubated in a buffer containing 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm MG132 for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The His-tagged proteins were purified from the clarified lysate by using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. To obtain purified phosphorylated proteins, Sf9 cells were treated with 0.1 mm of sodium vanadate as described elsewhere (44Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Masuhara M. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The purification of the phosphorylated proteins was carried out as described above. To obtain cell extracts from NIH3T3 cells expressing various avian Src constructs or Sf9 cells expressing various recombinant avian Src proteins, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm MG132, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described above. Lysates were sonicated for two cycles of 30 s and subsequently clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. E1 and Src were expressed in Sf9 cells, whereas GST-E2 (UbcH7) was expressed in Escherichia coli. Both E1 and E2 were purified as described elsewhere (16Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A.

The standard ubiquitination reaction mixture (50 μl) contained the 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 25 μm MG132 (to inhibit the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins), 2.5 μg of GST-ubiquitin, 100–400 ng of purified c-Cbl or mutant Cbl protein and 20–1000 μg of cell extracts containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. In some experiments, cell extracts were pretreated with the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 (Biomol) for 15 min before adding the ubiquitination reaction mixture. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.5 μg of GST-ubiquitin, incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, and terminated by adding 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. The ubiquitinated proteins in the reaction mixture were pulled down with GSH-Sepharose. The GSH-Sepharose beads were washed with 0.5% IGEPAL CA 630 (Sigma) in PBS three times, then boiled in 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer, and the samples were electrophoresed on 8% Tris-glycine gels (Novex). Western blotting was performed using 1:1000 dilutions of the appropriate antibody, and the blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained the 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μmMG132, and 1 mm ATP. 400 ng of recombinant GST-UbcH7, 30 μg of non-transfected Sf9 cell extracts or Src-expressing Sf9 cell extracts, and 400 ng of purified c-Cbl was added, and incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. At the end of the incubation, proteins that were associated with the GST-UbcH7 were isolated using GSH-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed with the reaction buffer without ATP but including the protease inhibitors. Immobilized proteins were electrophoresed and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. For some experiments, cell extracts were derived from Src-expressing Sf9 cells pretreated with PP1 for 15 min. A luciferase reporter gene construct containing the acute phase response element promotor, a cDNA encoding β-galactosidase and plasmids encoding v-Src and/or myc-tagged c-Cbl or mutant Cbl constructs were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells using the calcium-phosphate method as described elsewhere (16Yokouchi M.

After 36 h, cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase and β-galactosidase (a control for transfection efficiency) activities were measured as described previously (46Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that ubiquitination of the EGFR was mediated by c-Cbl (16Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We have also established in osteoclasts and other cell types that c-Cbl is a substrate of Src (40Tanaka S. Neff L. Baron R. Levy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14347-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 41Tanaka S. Amling M. Neff L. Peyman A. Uhlmann E. Levy J.B. Baron R. Nature. 1996; 383: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Cbl could induce the ubiquitination of Src, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay using extracts from Src−/− cells, untransfected NIH3T3 cells, or NIH3T3 cells that overexpressed wild type avian-Src or various avian Src mutants and GST-tagged ubiquitin. At the end of the assay, ubiquitinated proteins were isolated using glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose beads and immunoblotted with anti-Src antibody (Fig.1 A). Only the constitutively active SrcY527F, in which the regulatory tyrosine 527 residue has been mutated to phenylalanine, was extensively polyubiquitinated and only in the presence of c-Cbl (Fig. 1 A, lane 10). Because the molecular mass of GST-ubiquitin is 36 kDa, the predicted molecular mass of a single Src molecule conjugated to a single GST-ubiquitin is 96 kDa (arrow). Higher molecular mass species detected with anti-Src are therefore multi-ubiquitinated forms of Src. In the absence of c-Cbl, we could not detect any of the higher molecular mass bands representing ubiquitinated Src (Fig.1 A, lanes 3, 5, 7, and9). Not surprisingly, the oncogenic form of c-Cbl in which the RING finger and linker region is disrupted (70Z-Cbl), which we previously found to be unable to induce the ubiquitination of the EGF receptor (16Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), was also unable to induce the ubiquitination of activated Src Y527F (Fig. 1 A, lane 11). Thus, c-Cbl is capable of inducing the ubiquitination of Src when Src is constitutively active and in an open conformation, and this event is dependent upon the integrity of c-Cbl's RING finger domain. We then asked whether the Src kinase activity was necessary for this c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination event. We had detected no ubiquitination of Src K295M/Y527F, a Src molecule that is in the same “open” conformation as SrcY527F but is catalytically inactive (Fig. 1 B), indicating that an open conformation is not sufficient for Src polyubiquitination and that catalytic activity is required (Fig. 1 B). To further determine whether the c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of Src is kinase-dependent, we examined the effect of the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 on the Src ubiquitination (Fig. 1 C). Addition of PP1 to the assay inhibited the c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination of SrcY527F in a dose-dependent manner. These results clearly showed that c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of active Src not only requires the c-Cbl RING finger but is also dependent upon the kinase activity of Src. We also failed to detect ubiquitination of SrcY416F/Y527F, in which the autophosphorylated tyrosine 416 is replaced by phenylalanine and the molecule is in the open configuration (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7 and 8). Autophosphorylation of tyrosine 416 is required for full Src kinase activity (47Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 48Piwnica-Worms H. Saunders K.B. Roberts T.M. Smith A.E. Cheng S.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 75-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and the absence of detectable ubiquitination could therefore have been due to the reduced kinase activity. However, we recently demonstrated that Src phosphotyrosine 416 could directly bind to the c-Cbl PTB domain (30Sanjay A. Houghton A. Neff L. Didomenico E. Bardelay C. Antoine E. Levy J. Gailit J. Bowtell D. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 181-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and we therefore considered the possibility that our failure to detect ubiquitinated Src Y416F/Y527F indicated that the autophosphorylation of Src tyrosine 416 serves as Src's degradation signal, perhaps as a result of the interaction with c-Cbl's PTB domain. However, c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination of Src Y416F/Y527F was clearly detected when the amount of Src Y416F/Y527F in the assay was increased (Fig. 1 D), indicating that phosphorylation of tyrosine 416 is not required for c-Cbl-mediated Src ubiquitination. In contrast, Src K295M/Y527F, which has entirely lost its kinase activity, failed to be ubiquitinated, even when present at high concentrations (data not shown). These results confirmed that, whereas the kinase activity of Src is required for the c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination of Src, the phosphorylation of tyrosine 416 is not essential per se. We then considered the possibility that c-Cbl itself could become ubiquitinated in the process, potentially leading to the degradation of both components of the Src·c-Cbl complex. To address this question, we performed the same ubiquitination assay as described in Fig. 1 but immunoblotted the ubiquitinated proteins with anti-c-Cbl antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, c-Cbl was extensively polyubiquitinated in the presence of constitutively active SrcY527F (lanes 10 and 14). In contrast, there was little or no detectable ubiquitination of c-Cbl when extracts from Src−/− or 3T3 cells (which express little endogenous Src, data not shown), or the catalytically inactive Src K295M were used in the assay (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2, 4, and 12). Low to moderate levels of ubiquitination of c-Cbl were seen in the presence of overexpressed c-Src, or Src Y416F/Y527F Src cell extracts (Fig. 2 A,lanes 6 and 8). As previously observed for Src itself, the ubiquitination of c-Cbl required catalytically active Src (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 12 and 14) and was dramatically inhibited as the amount of Src Y527F was decreased (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–7) or as the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 was added (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8–10). Thus, the kinase activity of Src is required not only for its own, c-Cbl-dependent, ubiquitination (Fig. 1, A andB) but also for the ubiquitination of c-Cbl. We previously showe"

We have developed a lipid-mediated delivery system that can deliver functional proteins or other bioactive molecules into living cells. This delivery system is composed of a new trifluoroacetylated lipopolyamine (TFA-DODAPL) and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE). This cationic formulation successfully delivered antibodies, dextran sulfates, phycobiliproteins, albumin, and enzymes (β-galactosidase and proteases) into the cytoplasm of numerous adherent and suspension cells.

Second, the delivery system mediated delivery of several caspases (caspase 3, caspase 8, and granzyme B) into cultured cell lines and primary cells triggering apoptosis. Mechanistic studies showed that up to 100% of the protein mixed with the lipid formulation was captured into a lipid-protein complex, and up to 50% of the input protein associated with cells.

Often, the primary reason for performing DNA transfection is to express a desired protein in the transfected cell to investigate its function. In this respect DNA transfection technology can be considered an indirect protein delivery system. New methodologies to deliver functional proteins into cells are presently being evaluated, but are still lacking in convenience and effectiveness. The most actively studied approach uses a class of peptides that are 10–35 amino acids long and called “protein transduction domains” (PTD)1 (5Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F.

This study was aimed at generating an alternate method using a cationic lipid formulation (TFA-DODAPL:DOPE) that enables recombinant proteins, peptides, or antibodies to enter viable cells. We demonstrate that this approach is remarkably effective for delivering a number of different macromolecules into the cytoplasm of numerous cell types. Fluorescently labeled antibodies, high and low molecular weight dextrans, phycoerythrin, caspase 3, caspase 8, granzyme B, and β-galactosidase have been successfully delivered. Furthermore, apoptotic mediators such as granzyme B, caspase 3, or caspase 8 delivered to cells with TFA-DODAPL:DOPE remained functional and capable of inducing apoptosis. This innovative protein delivery system represents a powerful tool for functional genomics and may have potential for therapeutic applications. Monoclonal TRF2-FITC was obtained from IMGENEX (San Diego, CA). Unlabeled and FITC-labeled goat IgG, β-galactosidase, BSA, and cytochrome c were purchased from Sigma. Caspase 8 and caspase 3 were obtained from BioVision (Palo Alto, CA). Inactive mutant caspase 3 was a generous gift from Guy Salvesen (The Burnham Institute). Granzyme B was a generous gift from Jennifer Harris (Novartis Genomics, San Diego, CA). Dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Oregon Green 488-labeled dextran sulfate and phycoerythrin were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). NIH-3T3 (mouse fibroblast), HeLa-S3 (human carcinoma), BHK-21 (hamster kidney), CHO-K1 (hamster ovary), B16-F0 (mouse melanoma), 293 (human kidney), MDCK, P19 (mouse embryonal carcinoma), and Jurkat (human T cell leukemia) were obtained from ATCC. Ki-Ras 267β1 cells were a kind gift of Dr. John S. Rim (Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Biology, NCI, National Institutes of Health). Chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) were isolated from patients diagnosed with CD5+/CD19+ B-CML or CD34+myeloblasts, respectively, and isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. All cell lines were grown according to ATCC recommendation. Ki-Ras 267β1 were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum. CML and AML were grown in α-minimal essential medium, 10% fetal calf serum. The cationic lipid formulation is composed of a 2:1 mixture of a cationic lipid, TFA-DODAPL, and a neutral lipid, DOPE (US and international patents pending). TFA-DODAPL consists of 2 saturated C-18 alkyl chains linked to a core lysine residue through 1,3-dipropylamine. ε-Linked dilysine residues were added to this core lysine to produce DODAPL (2,6-diamino-hexanoic acid {5-amino-5-[5-[2-amino-6-(2,6-diamino-hexanoylamino)-hexanoylamino]-1-(3-dioctadecylamino-propylcarbamoyl)-pentylcarbamoyl]-pentyl}-amide). TFA-DODAPL:DOPE (called BioPORTER) has been used according to the manufacturers instructions (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Briefly, the BioPORTER dry film is re-suspended with 250 μl of methanol or chloroform and vortex for 10–20 s. Then, the desired amount of BioPORTER (depending on the type of experiment) is transferred into an Eppendorf tube and the solvent is evaporated under a hood for at least 2 h at room temperature. The molecule to be delivered is diluted in HBS (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) or PBS (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na phosphate, pH 7.4). The antibody, dextran sulfate 10 and 70 kDa, phycoerythrin, β-galactosidase, cytochrome c, and BSA solutions were diluted at 80–160 μg/ml in HBS or PBS (β-galactosidase). Caspase 3 and caspase 8 solutions were diluted at 165 to 1000 pg/μl and granzyme B solution was diluted at 7.5 to 60 ng/μl. The diluted protein solutions (10 to 25 μl) were then used to hydrate the dried BioPORTER formulation. The solution was pipetted up and down, incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and vortexed gently and briefly. Finally serum-free medium was added to the complexes according to the final transfection volume (250 μl for the 24-well plate). The molecules were seeded 0.5–1 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate (or on coverslips). The next day, the medium was aspirated from the cells (for coverslip, blot it dry and place it in a 35-mm dish) and then transfered the TFA-DODAPL:DOPE/protein mixture directly onto the cells. 2 μg of FITC-labeled antibody, 1 μg of Oregon Green 488-dextran, and 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase were delivered by TFA-DODAPL:DOPE (2.5 μl) to the cells in the serum free condition. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h (for longer incubation time 10% serum was added to the cells after 4 h). The cells were washed twice with PBS and coverslips were mounted directly onto a hanging drop slide. Living cells were directly examined with a fluorescent microscope (NIKON E-600) equipped with a ×60 objective and a 3-CCD camera or a confocal microscope (Axiovert 100, Zeiss). For β-galactosidase, cells were washed, fixed, and stained for β-galactosidase activity with a X-gal staining kit (Gene Therapy Systems). Cells such as Ki-Ras-267β1 were seeded at 0.5 × 105/well in 24-well and grown overnight. The diluted solutions of proteins were used to react with the TFA-DODAPL:DOPE formulation as described above. For adherent cells (Ki-Ras-267β1) the final volume of the TFA-DODAPL:DOPE/protein mixture was brought to 200 μl with serum-free medium. The culture medium was then aspirated from the cells and the TFA-DODAPL:DOPE/protein mixtures were transferred directly onto the cells. For suspension cells (Jurkat, AML) the cells were counted, centrifuged, and re-suspended in serum-free medium at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. 200 μl of the cell suspension were added to the TFA-DODAPL:DOPE·protein complexes, and then transferred to a 24-well plate. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and then 1 ml of serum-containing medium was added directly to each well and incubated overnight. The apoptosis assays were monitored with CaspaTag Fluorescein Caspase Activity Kit (Intergen Co., New York) and annexin V-FITC/propidium iodine Apoptotic Detection Kit (BioVision). The protein of interest (4 μg) was diluted in 20 μl of HBS and complexed or not to various amounts of TFA-DODAPL:DOPE (1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μl). Samples were loaded onto the native 4–20% Tris glycine gel and run at 125 V constant with Tris glycine running buffer (Novex, San Diego, CA). Then, gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad). 0.5 × 106 NIH-3T3 cells/well were plated in a 6-well plate. 10 μg of FITC-labeled IgG, 5 μg of FITC-labeled BSA, or 10 μg of a monoclonal antibody were diluted to 80 μg/ml in HBS and complexed to TFA-DODAPL:DOPE (12.5 μl). After formation of the TFA-DODAPL:DOPE·protein complexes, 875 μl of serum-free medium was added to the mixture. The culture medium was aspirated from the cells and the mixture was directly added onto the cells. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS, and medium + washes were pooled for fluorescence measurement. Cells were lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS, protease inhibitors mixture, and 50 mmdithiothreitol) for 10 min on ice. The cytosol and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. An aliquot of the samples were used to determine the protein concentration with the Bio-Rad DC protein assay Kit. Fluorescent samples were analyzed with a fluorometer (FluoroMax-2TM; Instruments S.A., Edison, NJ). For Western blot, samples were run in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose Hybond ECL membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Immunodetection was done with a mouse alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat antibody IgG F(ab′) (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated substrate kit (Bio-Rad). We investigated whether cationic lipid formulations effective for DNA transfection would also be useful for the delivery of functional proteins into cells. Twenty-five new cationic lipids were synthesized, formulated, and tested for their ability to deliver fluorescently labeled antibody (FITC-Ab) and β-galactosidase into NIH-3T3 cells. Among the lipids tested, a new trifluoroacetylated lipopolyamine (TFA-DODAPL) mixed with DOPE was the only formulation able to deliver both proteins into 70–75% NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 1). Seven commercial transfection reagents (DOTAP, DMRIE, Trans-IT, FuGene 6, Transfast, LipofectAMINE, and Lipofectin) were also tested and all were inefficient (<5% delivery efficiency) for FITC-Ab and β-galactosidase delivery (not shown). Other lipid formulations, negatively charged (DOPG ± DOPE, DOPC, or cholesterol) and neutral (DOPC ± DOPE or cholesterol), were also analyzed and no proteins were successfully delivered (data not shown). The formulation of TFA-DODAPL was optimized by testing multiple helper lipids (DOPC, DOPE, and cholesterol) at different cationic lipid/neutral lipid ratios. In this way the optimized TFA-DODAPL:DOPE formulation (BioPORTER) composed of a 2:1 mixture of TFA-DODAPL and DOPE was selected. When the dried cationic TFA-DODAPL:DOPE lipid formulation is hydrated with a solution of the protein to be delivered, a complex between the lipid and protein spontaneously forms. These complexes when applied to cultured cells to deliver the protein into the cells (Fig. 1). TFA-DODAPL:DOPE-mediated delivery of FITC-Ab, fluorescently labeled dextrans, and β-galactosidase into NIH-3T3 cells is shown in Fig. 1. Nearly all NIH-3T3 cells contained FITC-Ab (Fig. 1 B) or β-galactosidase activity (Fig.1 D) after treatment with these TFA-DODAPL:DOPE·protein complexes. In contrast, without the delivery agent, neither antibody (Fig. 1 A) nor β-galactosidase (Fig. 1 C) was delivered into the cells. This cationic lipid formulation also delivered dextran sulfate into cells. Low molecular mass dextran (10 kDa) was able to enter into the nucleus of the transduced cells (Fig. 1 E), whereas, high molecular mass dextran (70 kDa) did not (Fig.1 F). This is consistent with published results showing that diffusion of high molecular weight molecules lacking a nuclear localization signal through the nuclear pore is size restricted (17Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Cellular uptake of dextran sulfate also required the lipid-mediated delivery system (not shown). These results showed that the delivery system did not alter the biodistribution of dextran molecules. We monitored by flow cytometry the ability of TFA-DODAPL:DOPE to deliver phycoerythrin, a high molecular weight protein (Mr 240,000). Primary AML, Jurkat, Ki-Ras 267β1, and primary CML cells registered 99, 70, 55, and 35% uptake, respectively (not shown). The different percentages of effective transduction suggest that the lipid-mediated protein delivery is cell type dependent. To demonstrate the versatility of this system, we have investigated TFA-DODAPL:DOPE-mediated delivery of FITC-Ab into different cell lines. Fig. 2 Ashows intracellular delivery of a FITC-Ab in various cells. In all cases, the cells treated with antibody in the absence of the lipid formulation displayed no intracellular fluorescence. Other cells were also successfully transduced including 293, MDCK, and P19 cells (not shown). Furthermore, various antibodies obtained from different sources gave similar results. The optimal delivery of a fluorescent antibody into NIH-3T3 cells was achieved after 4 h of incubation (Fig.2 B). Longer incubation periods (24–96 h) led to decreases in both the number of positive cells and the intracellular fluorescence intensity. Serum-free conditions were required during the first 4 h of incubation (not shown). The delivery efficiency also depended on the amount of lipid and on the quantity of protein delivered (Fig. 2, C and D). For NIH-3T3 cells optimal delivery in 24-well plates was seen with 1–2 μg of fluorescent antibody and 2.5 μl of TFA-DODAPL:DOPE formulation (Fig. 2, C and D). Optimal delivery is also dependent on the protein concentration used to form the TFA-DODAPL:DOPE·protein complexes. The optimal concentration for antibody or β-galactosidase was between 80 and 200 μg/ml. At the highest antibody concentration, the delivery efficiency decreased, but the intracellular fluorescence intensity in the positive cells was high (Fig. 2 E, bars). In contrast, at lower protein concentrations, the percentage of fluorescent cells was high, but the intracellular intensity was low (Fig. 2 E, lines). To demonstrate the functionality of lipid-mediated protein delivery, we chose to examine protease mediators of apoptosis induction. Several reasons supported this choice. First, the function of apoptosis inducing proteases is extensively described in the literature and they have potent activity (18Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar, 19Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6228) Google Scholar). Second, assays are well established for measuring their activities. Third, these enzymes represent a major interest in research and therapeutic applications (18Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2761) Google Scholar, 19Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6228) Google Scholar, 20Reed J.C. Tomaselli K.J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the demonstration that apoptotic proteases and other types of apoptosis modulators can be delivered intracellularly in their biologically active form would provide a versatile tool for investigating the apoptotic cascade in cellular and disease models. We tested the ability of TFA-DODAPL:DOPE to deliver functional granzyme B into primary human AML cells (Fig. 3). Granzyme B is a serine protease that is produced and stored in granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes. This protease cleaves and activates multiple members of the caspase family (21Trapani J.A. Davis J. Sutton V.R. Smyth M.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The bioactivity of granzyme B therefore was assessed by measuring activation of endogenous caspases using a fluorigenic cell permeable substrate, CaspaTag, which can be monitored by flow cytometry. Fig. 3, A and B, shows AML cells treated with either BSA-phycoerythrin alone (BSA-PE; used as a marker of incorporation), or a mixture of BSA-PE and granzyme B. The fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis shows that cationic lipid formulation-mediated granzyme B delivery caused 40% of the cells to activate caspases (x axis). It indicates also that the cationic lipid formulation delivered BSA-PE to virtually 100% of the cells (y axis). Similar results were obtained with other types of primary cells such as CML or CLL (not shown). The same experimental approach was used to deliver caspase 3, granzyme B, and caspase 8 into Jurkat cells (Fig. 3). Caspase-3 was the most potent apoptosis inducer, leading to ∼40% of the cells to score positive for caspases activity. Granzyme B and caspase 8 generated ∼20% caspase positive cells, with the background of caspase activity in the culture being 7%. We also compared electroporation and TFA-DODAPL:DOPE efficacy using a wide variety of conditions for voltage and capacitance (not shown). Electroporation was shown to be toxic to Jurkat cells since 90% were killed under electroporation conditions that resulted in successful BSA-PE protein delivery. In contrast, TFA-DODAPL:DOPE treatment was deleterious to only 10% of the cell population (not shown). The delivery of a functional granzyme B was further assayed by monitoring the early and late phases of the apoptotic process. The early stage is characterized by the cell membrane exposure of phosphatidylserine normally restricted to the inner cell membrane (22Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), which is recognized by annexin V-FITC. The later phase of the apoptosis can be assessed by measuring the DNA labeling with the propidium iodine indicator of the cell membrane permeabilization (19Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6228) Google Scholar). We confirmed that granzyme B delivered by TFA-DODAPL:DOPE induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells. Granzyme B alone and the lipid formulation alone or complexed to a control protein (β-galactosidase) were ineffective to induce apoptosis (Fig. 4, C, D, andF, and Table I). As a positive control, we used staurosporine a well known chemical inducer of apoptosis (23Arrigo A.P. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B and Table I). These results demonstrate the efficacy of the delivery system, however, not all apoptotic modulators were effective. Indeed, cytochrome c, another powerful effector of apoptosis failed to induce apoptosis when delivered with the transport system (Table I). This observation illustrates the importance of the intrinsic properties such as charge and structure of the molecules to be delivered in order to support TFA-DODAPL-mediated transduction.Table ITFA-DODAPL:DOPE mediated delivery of apoptotic proteases into cells% of apoptotic cellsaThe percentage was normalized with cells alone being 0% of apoptosis.Jurkat CellsKi-Ras 267β1 CellsCells alone00Staurosporine95.154TFA-DODAPL:DOPE alone5.67.5Granzyme B alone1.510.1300 ng of granzyme B + TFA-DODAPL:DOPE28.6N.D.450 ng of granzyme B + TFA-DODAPL:DOPE42.360.7β-Galactosidase + TFA-DODAPL:DOPE4.911.8Cytochrome c + TFA-DODAPL:DOPE2.6N.D.Caspase 3N.D.0Caspase 3 + TFA-DODAPL:DOPEN.D.58.8Cells were incubated with granzyme B (450 ng), caspase 3 (3.3 ng), and β-galactosidase (2 μg) ± 2.5 μl of TFA-DODAPL:DOPE for 24 h and then analyzed with annexin V-FITC/propidium iodine apoptotic detection kit.

Data show the percentage of apoptotic cells (annexin V-FITC + and propidium iodine + or −). b N.D., not determined. The cationic lipid carrier system was also used to deliver apoptotic proteases into adherent Ki-Ras 267β1 cells. The effects of granzyme B and caspase delivery were tested by measuring the percentage of cells that underwent apoptosis as determined by the annexin V-FITC staining kit (Table I). β-Galactosidase and staurosporine were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. TFA-DODAPL:DOPE-mediated delivery of granzyme B and caspase 3 induced apoptosis of Ki-Ras 267β1 cells to a similar extent (60 and 58%). These two proteins delivered by TFA-DODAPL:DOPE were as potent as staurosporine. No apoptosis was observed without the addition of the lipid formulation and with the lipid formulation alone or complexed to a control protein (β-galactosidase). To confirm that the induced apoptosis was only mediated by the delivery of the apoptotic proteases, we conducted another experiment with an inactive mutant of caspase 3 and compared its effect with caspase 3 and granzyme B (Fig. 4J). No significant apoptosis was observed with the mutant caspase 3 confirming that the induction of apoptosis was effectively mediated by the intracellular release of the active caspase 3. The results in Fig. 4 Jconfirm that at the optimal doses tested, the lipid formulation complexed with control proteins such as β-galactosidase, phycoerythrin-BSA, and inactive caspase 3 does not trigger apoptosis. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was influenced by the amount of granzyme B or caspase 3 delivered. With Ki-Ras 267β1 cells, the plateau was reached with 150 ng of granzyme B and 3.3 ng of caspase 3 (Fig. 4, G and H). The TFA-DODAPL:DOPE dose-response was also investigated (Fig. 4 I). Fixed amounts of granzyme B, caspase 3, and caspase 8 were delivered with increasing amounts of the lipid formulation. The level of caspase activation was TFA-DODAPL:DOPE dependent. However, spontaneous caspase activation was induced by the higher concentrations of the cationic lipid formulation. This phenomenon depends on the cell type and density. The mechanism of TFA-DODAPL:DOPE-mediated protein delivery may be analogous to that of cationic lipid-mediated DNA delivery (24Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 25Xu Y. Szoka Jr., F.C.

(ii) Interaction of the complex with cells. (iii) Intracellular uptake and release of the protein into the cytoplasm. According to this mechanism, proteins that fail to interact with the cationic lipids will not get into the cells. The physical properties, such as charge, lipophilicity, and hydrophobicity, of the protein would be expected to influence its ability to interact with the cationic lipids. A native protein gel shift assay was developed to compare the ability of TFA-DODAPL:DOPE to capture different proteins. Increasing amounts of lipids were mixed with a protein of interest and the mixture was applied to a native polyacrylamide gel. The results in Fig.5 illustrate the parameters of this assay with 3 different proteins, β-galactosidase, goat IgG, and BSA. The majority of β-galactosidase is shifted by the lowest amount of TFA-DODAPL:DOPE indicating its capture by the lipid preparation (Fig.5 A, lane 2). TFA-DODAPL:DOPE shifts the IgG somewhat less efficiently, but at the two highest lipid concentrations the IgG is completely shifted (Fig. 5 A, lanes 9 and 10). Thus, TFA-DODAPL:DOPE can capture nearly 100% of these two proteins. In contrast, BSA did not interact very well with the lipid formulation (Fig. 5 B). Qualitatively, these results correlated with the delivery results for these three proteins showing that β-galactosidase and IgG were efficiently delivered to cells (Fig. 1), but BSA was not (not shown). This native protein gel shift assay can also be used for positively charged proteins like cytochromec. A weak interaction between cytochrome c and the delivery system was observed (not shown) supporting its lack of apoptosis induction (Table I). Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry results showed that TFA-DODAPL:D"

Iron is required by all organisms; it is used as a cofactor in key redox enzymes involved in such diverse biological processes as cell respiration and the synthesis of metabolic intermediates. However, iron can damage cells by reacting with hydrogen peroxide to form the hydroxyl radical. This highly toxic compound damages DNA, proteins, and lipids (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4556) Google Scholar). Prokaryote and eukaryote cells therefore have evolved various systems for the close regulation of iron transport and its intracellular use (2Hantke K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 3Rouault T. Klausner R. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaehas several pathways of iron transport including a low affinity transporter encoded by FET4 (4Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a number of high affinity systems. One of these high affinity systems is encoded byFET3 and FTR1 (5Askwith C.

Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). It requires the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by plasma membrane reductases (FRE1 or FRE2) (7Dancis A.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The other high affinity transport systems are siderophore-mediated and depend on several homologous transporters of the major superfacilitator (MSF) family encoded by ARN1, SIT1, TAF1, andENB1 (9Lesuisse E.

All the genes involved in the high affinity iron transport systems are under the control of the iron-dependent transcription activator Aft1p (12Yun C.W. Ferea T. Rashford J. Ardon O. Brown P.O.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11770-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition to the high affinity transport genes, Aft1p regulates the transcription of other iron-responsive genes such as those encoding Ccc2p (the intracellular copper transporter responsible for delivering copper to Fet3p) (16Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), Fth1p (which forms an iron transport complex on the vacuole with Fet5p) (17Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), Fre3p/Fre4p (which are potential siderophore-iron reductases) (18Yun C.W. Bauler M. Moore R.E. Klebba P.E. Philpott C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10218-10223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and Fre5p/Fre6p of unknown function (19Martins L.J. Jensen L.T.

Finally, Aft1p seems to be involved in, but is not required for, the transcription of genes such as ATX1, which encodes the copper chaperone that delivers copper to Ccc2p, andISU1/ISU2, the products of which are involved in the mitochondrial assembly of iron-sulfur clusters (20Lin S.J.

Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In conditions of iron deprivation, Aft1p actives the transcription of target genes by binding directly to the consensus sequence T/CG/ACACCC, a motif in its 5′-upstream regions. Although the functional DNA binding and activation domains of Aft1p have not yet been characterized, its similarities to other transcription factors suggest that the N-terminal region rich in basic residues is involved in recognizing DNA, and the C-terminal glutamine-rich domains may be required for the transcriptional activation function. The dominant allele AFT1up, which leads to Phe-291 in place of Cys-291 in the N-terminal region of the protein, constitutively binds to DNA (13Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 14Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Just how Aft1p senses iron and activates gene expression is not understood, and recent data indicate that the Aft1p-mediated response is not restricted to iron deprivation conditions but can be induced by the concentrations of molecular oxygen or copper in the culture medium (22Gross C. Kelleher M. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32310-32316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23Hassett R.F. Romeo A.M. Kosman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7628-7636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have now attempted to obtain further information about the regulation of iron homeostasis by inspecting the yeast genome by blast analysis. We found a 416-amino acid protein encoded by the YPL202c gene that presents 39% overall identity to Aft1p, which we designated Aft2p (Fig. 1). This paper describes some of the characteristics of Aft2p. It is a second iron-regulated transcriptional activator in yeast. Aft2p is required for iron homeostasis and resistance to oxidative stress when Aft1p is absent. Molecular data and phenotypic analysis suggest that Aft1p and Aft2p have overlapping functions. The strains used in this study were CM3260 (MATα, trp1-63, leu2-3, 112 gcn4-101, his3-609), Y18 (MATα, trp1-63, leu2-3, 112 gcn4-101, his3-609, aft1::TRP1), and Y19 (MATα, trp1-63, leu2-3, 112 gcn4-101, his3-609, fet3::URA3). The CM3260aft2Δ (MATα, trp1-63, leu2-3, 112 gcn4-101, his3-609, aft2:: kanMX4) and Y18aft2Δ (MATα, trp1-63, leu2-3, 112 gcn4-101, his3-609, aft1::TRP1,aft2:: kanMX4) strains were constructed by integrating kanMX4 at the AFT2 locus in strains CM3260 and Y18 as described in Ref. 24Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar. The following primers were used to amplify the open reading frame replacement cassette containing the kanMX4 marker with long flanking homology regions of the AFT2 promoter and terminator: 5′-GGGTATAAGGAGTGTCAAAG-3′, 5′-GGGGATCCGTCGACCTGCAGCGTACCATTTCTTGGGGTCGCTTTC-3′, 5′-AACGAGCTCGAATTCATCGATGATATAATTATTTAGTTTTCAACTC-3′, and 5′-GATGCCTTATTTGTGGTCTG-3′. The sequences underlined are homologous to the kanMX4 marker. Kanamycin-resistant clones were selected on YPD plates containing G418 (200 μg/ml). Deletions were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using primers flanking the insertion region. The plasmid pEG202 and the derivative plasmids pEG202-AFT1 and pEG202-AFT2 contained the DNA binding domain of LexA. Plasmid pEG202-AFT1 expressing LexA-Aft1p and plasmid pEG202-AFT2 encoding LexA-Aft2p were constructed by integrating the open reading frames ofAFT1 or AFT2 in frame with the DNA binding domain of LexA. Open reading frames were amplified with the following oligonucleotides: AFT1, 5′-CAGAAGAATTCACGACAATGGAAGGCTTC-3′ and 5′-TTCATCTCGACTAATCTTCTGGCTTCAC-3′; and AFT2, 5′-AAGCGGGATCCAAGAAATGAAAGCAAAGTCGA-3′ and 5′-GAAAACTCGAGAATTAATATTTTGATATTAAGGC-3′. The amplified fragments were digested by EcoRI and XhoI for AFT1and by BamHI and XhoI for AFT2 and ligated to the DNA binding domain of LexA derived from the plasmid pEG202 (25Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar) digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. The plasmid pSH18–34 contained the GAL1-lexop-lacZ reporter gene from which the upstream activation sequence GAL1 had been deleted and replaced by four lexA operators (26Hanes S.D. Brent R. Cell. 1989; 57: 1275-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Plasmid pFC-W, generously supplied by Yamaguchi-Iwai, contained a 30-base pair cassette of the FET3 upstream activation sequence (−263 to −234) fused to LacZ (14Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown in rich medium (1% yeast extract/2% peptone) containing either 2% glucose (YPD) or 2% raffinose, or in copper and iron limiting yeast nitrogen base (Bio101) plus the required amino acids and 2% glucose. Ferric ammonium sulfate (100 μm) was added to the defined medium to create the iron-repleted medium. Copper ammonium sulfate (10–100 μm) was added to the defined medium to create the copper-repleted medium in experiments where copper toxicity was assessed. However, because of the hypersensitivity of the double aft1aft2 mutant to this ion (see “Results”), copper was omitted from the regular synthetic medium. Cells were grown anaerobically in a Forma Scientific anaerobic chamber. The cells were grown in liquid cultures in 50-ml Falcon tubes placed on a gyroshaker at 30 °C. For plate assays, the cells were suspended in water at 2 × 106 cells/ml, plated in serial 10-fold dilutions, and incubated at 30 °C for 3–4 days prior to imaging. Total RNA was isolated by the hot phenol method (27Kohrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed as described previously (28Thomas P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5201-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (5861) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments used as probes corresponding to the open reading frames of each gene were as follows: for FET3 a 0.8-kilobaseBamHI-ScaI fragment, for ACT1 a 1.2-kilobase BamHI-HindIII fragment, and forATX1 a 0.26-kilobase fragment that was isolated from a polymerase chain reaction-amplified product corresponding to the open reading frame of ATX1 by using the primers 5′-CAAGAGGATCCTAGCGAAAAGATGGCAGAG-3′ and 5′-ATTTCTCTGCAGTTTCATTCACAATTGTTTGCC-3′. β-Galactosidase was assayed as described previously (29Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The designated isogenic yeast strains were grown in the iron and copper limiting yeast nitrogen base medium (Bio101) supplemented with 10 μm iron for 18 h, collected by centrifugation, and washed twice in 10 mmEDTA and once in metal-free water. The total iron was measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy at the Microanalysis Facility of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (Vernaison, France) on cells suspended in 0.1n nitric acid. The designated isogenic yeast strains were grown in the YPD medium without (−Fe) or with 100 μm iron (+Fe). The respiratory activity of whole cells was evaluated by an oxypolarographic method. The rate of oxygen consumption was measured using a 2.2-ml thermostated oxypolarographic cell equipped with a Clark-type electrode. The respiratory medium was a 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (30 °C), saturated with air (236 μm dissolved O2) containing 2 mm glucose. The cells were prepared as 50% (w/v) suspensions in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The open reading frame of AFT2 predicted a protein with a molecular mass of 47 kDa and a pI of 9. The N-terminal parts of Aft2p and Aft1p were the most similar regions in the proteins. This region is rich in basic amino acids and contains four cysteine residues, which are potential iron ligands, at residues 143, 215, 291, and 293 in Aft1p and at 86, 109, 187, and 189 in Aft2p. But we found notable differences between the two protein sequences despite their similarity. Aft2p contained no N- or C-terminal histidine-rich domains; these have been predicted to coordinate iron in Aft1p (13Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Aft2p lacked the C-terminal glutamine-rich domain of Aft1p, which may be required for the transactivation function of Aft1p (31Casas C. Aldea M. Espinet C. Gallego C. Gil R. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The homologous domains in the conserved N-terminal region were separated by inserted sequences in Aft1p. For example, the very highly charged segment of Aft1p (amino acids 147–168) was absent from Aft2p (Fig.1). Finally, the pSORT program indicated that there are several nuclear localization signals such as basic clusters and a bipartite sequence signal in the N-terminal region of Aft1p. No such signals could be identified in the Aft2p sequence (Fig. 1). Therefore, there is a 78% possibility that Aft1p is nuclear but only a 56% chance that Aft2p is a nuclear protein. But there is also a 35% possibility that Aft2p is a mitochondrial protein. The complete open reading frame of the Aft2p protein was fused to that of the bacterial lexA DNA binding domain. This lexA-Aft2p chimera was then produced in the wild-type strain CM3260 carrying a Gal1-lacZ reporter gene with four lexA operators replacing the upstream activation sequence GAL1. The lexA-Aft1p fusion protein was also produced in these cells. The lexA-Aft2p fusion protein activated the transcription of the Gal1-lacZ reporter gene, indicating that Aft2p has a transactivation function (TableI). Cells were grown in synthetic medium with or without 100 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate; iron-depleted cells and iron-repleted cells produced the same amount of β-galactosidase activity in the presence of lexA-Aft1p, whereas iron-repleted cells produced only half as much as iron-depleted cells in the presence of lexA-Aft2p (Table I). The same results were obtained with iron citrate as a source of iron (data not shown).Table ILexA-Aft2p as a transcription activatorLexA fusion presentLexAop-GAL1-lacZ expression−Fe+Feunits/A600LexA<10<10LexA-Aft1p2850 ± 1402510 ± 35LexA-Aft2p1460 ± 110770 ± 120Wild-type strain CM3260 was transformed with both the plasmid pSH18-34 and plasmids pEG202, pEG202-AFT1, or pEG202-AFT2.

Appropriate transformants in the exponential phase of growth were placed in copper and iron limiting medium without (−Fe) or with 100 μmiron (+Fe). β-galactosidase activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The averages of three independent experiments are shown with standard deviations. We examined the role of AFT2 in the transcription of the AFT1-regulated genes by constructing isogenic wild-type and aft1 mutant strains lacking theAFT2 gene. We also constructed a strain overproducing Aft2p by introducing a high copy number plasmid carrying the AFT2gene into the double aft1aft2 mutant. We measured the amounts of FET3 and ATX1 mRNAs in the variousaft mutants grown under iron-depleted or iron-repleted conditions. The aft2 and wild-type strains contained similar amounts of FET3 transcripts (Fig.2 A). The amount ofFET3 mRNAs in the aft1 strain was much lower, and the low level of transcription was repressed by iron. No signal was detected in the double aft1aft2 mutant even in iron-deprived conditions. The overproduction of Aft2p in the aft1aft2mutant restored the iron-regulated transcription of FET3. There were fewer ATX1 transcripts in iron-repleted conditions than in iron-depleted conditions in the wild type or in single aft1 and aft2 mutants. However, the levels of ATX1 mRNA seemed unaffected by the iron status in the double aft1aft2 mutant. Moreover, overproduction of Aft2p in the aft1aft2 cells was accompanied by a significant increase in ATX1 mRNA concentration. We investigated the capacity of AFT2 to activate the transcription of FET3 by acting at the Aft1p DNA binding site. Cells of the same strains were transformed with a plasmid containing the AFT1-responsive element of FET3 placed in front of a β-galactosidase reporter gene. This construct made β-galactosidase activity regulated by AFT1 (14Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Stearman R. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Thus, the β-galactosidase activity gave a measure of the activation of transcription at the AFT1binding site. Both aft2 and wild-type strains grown under iron-deprived conditions had similar β-galactosidase activities (Fig.2 B). In contrast, no β-galactosidase activity was detected in the aft1 and aft1aft2 strains. Thus, overproduction of Aft2p by the aft1aft2 cells significantly increased the β-galactosidase activity, which is in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 2 A. ThisAFT2-dependent transcription activity was also repressed strongly by adding iron. The wild-type strain and the aft2 and fet3 mutants grew well on agar plates supplemented with the specific iron chelator ferrozine, whereas the aft1 strain grew less well under these condition (Fig. 3). The growth of the aft1 mutant was restored by increasing the concentration of iron from 10 to 100 μm. The growth of the doubleaft1aft2 mutant was completely abolished under iron-deprived conditions. It was only restored by adding 100 μm iron to the ferrozine-containing plates. Thus, the aft1 strain was sensitive to iron deprivation, and this sensitivity was exacerbated by the absence of Aft2p. The inability of the aft1 and theaft1aft2 strains to grow on iron-poor medium was not caused by a deficiency in the high affinity iron transport system, because the growth of the isogenic fet3 mutant was not affected under these conditions. We next determined whether the requirement of more external iron by theaft1 and aft1aft2 mutants was because of a smaller intracellular iron pool or a defect in the iron availability in the mutant cells. We measured the intracellular iron content of the cells before growing them in iron-deficient medium. The aftmutants had iron pools similar to those of the wild-type strain before the shift (Fig. 4 A). However, the maximal cellular density reached in the medium without iron by theaft1 strain was lower compared with the wild-type andaft2 strains (Fig. 4 B). The growth defect was exacerbated for the aft1aft2 mutant. The growth of theaft1aft2 strain was restored completely by adding a limited concentration of iron (Fig. 4 C). The rates of oxygen consumption of the twoaft1 mutants were much higher than those of the wild-type and aft2 strains (Table II). The oxygen consumption was sensitive to cyanide and was nearly the same with or without high iron concentrations in the growth medium. We investigated this further by analyzing the phenotypes of cells grown in a medium containing raffinose as the sole carbon source. Unlike glycerol, raffinose is a not a strictly respirable carbon source. We thus could analyze the growth of the cells in the presence or absence of oxygen. The growth of the fet3 mutant on raffinose under aerobic conditions was slightly affected compared with theaft2 and wild-type strains (Fig.5). In contrast, aft1 mutant strains were unable to use this carbon source under aerobic conditions. The aft1-related growth deficiency was suppressed by overproducing Aft2p. The aft1 mutant phenotype could also be rescued by adding iron and also copper to the medium. Theaft1aft2 mutant phenotype was not rescued by the addition of iron or copper. Similar results were obtained when glycerol was used instead of raffinose (data not shown). Finally, the growth of both theaft1 and the aft1aft2 strains was restored completely under anaerobic conditions without adding iron or copper.Table IIRespiratory overactivity of aft1 and aft1aft2 mutantsStrainsRespiratory activity−Fe+Fenmol · min−1 · mg−1Wild type250 ± 20260 ± 20aft1575 ± 35580 ± 40aft2245 ± 35250 ± 30aft1 aft2580 ± 30590 ± 40The designated isogenic yeast strains were grown in the YPD liquid medium without (−Fe) or with 100 μm iron (+Fe) for 18 h and collected by centrifugation.

The oxygen consumption was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures”. All experiments were run on two independent cultures at two protein concentrations. In all the cases, the respiratory activity was inhibited by 50 mmpotassium cyanide. We investigated the sensitivity of the aftmutants to oxygen toxicity by analyzing their growth in a medium containing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The breakdown of hydrogen peroxide by metals such as iron generates toxic hydroxyl radicals by the Fenton reaction (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4556) Google Scholar). The aft1mutant grew less well on YPD medium containing 1 mmH2O2 than did the wild-type, aft2, and fet3 strains (Fig.6 A). The aft1aft2mutant was unable to grow under the above conditions. The overproduction of Aft2p by the double aft1aft2 mutant allowed this strain to grow in the presence of H2O2. The growth of the aft1 strain was completely restored by supplementing the medium with either iron or copper, whereas the growth of the aft1aft2 strain was restored only by adding iron. These results indicate that theaft1, and particularly the aft1aft2, mutants are hypersensitive to oxidative stress. We confirmed these results by phenotype analysis for stress phenotypes related to metal redox dysregulation. The aft1aft2 mutant was hypersensitive to 10–100 μm copper in YPD medium (Fig. 6 B). This strain was also unable to grow in minimal medium unless we added methionine or homocysteine. It also had a partial lysine auxotrophy (Fig. 6 C and data not shown). All these oxidative stress-related phenotypes were suppressed under anaerobic growth conditions and partially suppressed by adding iron to the aerobic growth medium. AFT1 controls the transport of iron via the reductive and the siderophore-mediated high affinity iron uptake systems in response to iron deprivation conditions. We have now shown that the Aft1p-homologous protein, Aft2p, is a second mediator of iron-regulated control of transcription in yeast. The most similar domains of Aft1p and Aft2p are in the basic N-terminal regions of the proteins. This region has four conserved cysteine residues including the CDC sequence supposed to ligate iron in Aft1p (13Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Aft2p was found to possess a transactivation activity that is lower relative to that of Aft1p (TableI). The transactivation activity of Aft2p was reduced by 50% when there was iron in the medium, whereas the transactivation activity of Aft1p was not affected. This confirms a previous report that indicates that the transcriptional activation function of Aft1p is independent of iron (31Casas C. Aldea M. Espinet C. Gallego C. Gil R. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, the transcriptional activation function of Aft2p may be iron-dependent. Our data confirm previous studies that indicate that a residual iron regulated transcription of FET3 is present in anAFT1 deleted strain (31Casas C. Aldea M. Espinet C. Gallego C. Gil R. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We show that Aft2p may be responsible for the remaining transcription of FET3. We have also demonstrated that overproduction of Aft2p activates, in an iron-regulated manner, the transcription of both the FET3gene and the LacZ reporter gene placed under the control of the AFT1-responsive element. The modulation by iron of theAFT2-dependent regulation in aft1strains seems to be greater than 2-fold, suggesting that iron could regulate both the transactivation and DNA binding functions of Aft2p. These results suggest that Aft2p is recruited to a sequence identical or similar to the T/GG/ACACCC AFT1-responsive element and may take part in the transcription of genes that overlapAFT1 target genes. Our present findings show that the amount of ATX1 mRNA is regulated by iron. This regulation appears to be lost in the double aft1aft2 mutant. Moreover, the amount of the ATX1 mRNA is increased with the overproduction of Aft2p. These results support a previous report that indicates that ATX1 mRNA is unaffected in strains containing an aft1Δ null mutation but is increased in the hyperactive AFT1-up allele (20Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9215-9220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). It indicates that the Aft proteins in addition to other transcription factors may be involved in the iron-regulated transcription of ATX1. We also compared the growth of the aft strains with those of the fet3 and wild-type strains under iron-deprived conditions to identify the role of Aft2p in iron metabolism. Previous studies have indicated that the aft1 mutant is more sensitive to iron deprivation than is the fet3 mutant despite their comparable measured ferrous iron uptakes. It has been suggested that Aft1p mediates some intracellular iron use in addition to its role in the regulation of iron transport (13Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Our phenotypic analysis of growth on agar plates containing an iron-depleted medium indicates that the growth of the aft1 mutant is affected by iron starvation, whereas that of the isogenic fet3 mutant is not. The double aft1aft2 mutant is totally unable to grow under these conditions. We have also shown that aft1 andaft1aft2 cells both have normal iron contents similar to those of wild-type cells. Thus, the inability of aft mutants to grow in an iron-poor medium is not solely caused by defective iron uptake. It confirms the predicted role for AFT1 in the control of intracellular iron use and suggests that Aft2p is critical, with Aft1p, for the modulation of iron homeostasis in yeast. A previous report indicated that the aft1 mutant is unable to grow in medium with glycerol as a respiratory carbon source (31Casas C. Aldea M. Espinet C. Gallego C. Gil R. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 621-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The authors attributed this to a defective high affinity iron uptake. This defect makes the intracellular iron content too low to sustain respiratory growth. Our data do not support this. First, theaft1 mutants all have functional mitochondrial respiration that is 2-fold higher than in the wild-type and aft2 strains whatever the iron concentration in the medium (Table II). This result is consistent with the measurements of cytochrome absorption spectra and cytochrome c oxidase activities (data not shown) that indicate that the aft1 and aft1aft2 mutants have a normal capacity to synthesize cytochromes and a normal respiratory cytochrome c oxidase activity. Second, the aft1mutant is unable to grow under aerobic conditions on agar plates containing raffinose as carbon source, whereas the isogenicfet3 mutant does grow. Third, this oxygen-dependent phenotype is not specific to an iron deficiency, because adding copper restores the growth of theaft1 mutant to the same extent as does iron (Fig. 5). But, adding iron or copper does not suppress the aft1-mediated mutant phenotypes in the absence of Aft2p. This suggests that elevated iron or copper concentration in the medium could induce some other pathway(s) to compensate for the deficiency of aft1 and that this putative metal-mediated compensatory pathway requires the presence of Aft2p. Thus, these results do not support the notion that the inability of aft1 mutants to grow on respiratory medium is due entirely to a defective high affinity iron uptake. The aft1, and particularly the aft1aft2, mutants are hypersensitive to H202, and theaft1aft2 mutant has several oxygen-dependent and iron-dependent phenotypes such as a hypersensitivity to copper and a methionine auxotrophy. Mutants, the copper detoxification of which is affected such as the ace1 and cup1mutants, are hypersensitive to copper under aerobic conditions (32Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar,39Hamer D.H. Thiele D.J Lemontt J.E. Science. 1985; 228: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Oxygen-dependent methionine auxotrophy has been reported for the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase sod1 mutant and for the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase zwf1 mutant, both of which are critical for maintaining the redox state of cells (33Slekar K.H. Kosman D.J. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We suggest therefore that the aft1aft2-mediated misuse of iron renders the cells hypersensitive to a variety of metal redox stresses. This agrees with recent data showing a relationship between superoxide stress mediated by a sod1 mutant and the dysregulation of iron homeostasis (34De Freitas J.M. Liba A. Meneghini R. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11645-11649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 35Srinivasan C. Liba A. Imlay J.A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29187-29192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The phenotypic similarities between theaft1aft2 and the sod1 mutants could occur, because the aft1aft2 mutant lacks Sod1p activity. However, the degree of SOD1 transcription and Sod1p activity inaft1aft2, aft1, aft2, and wild-type strains are not significantly different (data not shown). Thus, theaft1aft2-mediated stress phenotypes are not caused by a lack of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase per se. Copper transport and copper detoxification is under the control of two related transcription activators, Mac1p and Ace1p, in yeast (36Winge D.R. Jensen L.T. Srinivasan C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The parallel between the metabolisms of iron and copper suggests that the two homologous proteins Aft1p and Aft2p may coordinate the transcription of the genes involved in the homeostasis of iron and protection against iron toxicity. In support of this, Aft1p was shown recently to interact in a two-hybrid assay with Grx3p, a glutaredoxin involved in the protecting of proteins from oxidative damage, and with Yap5p, a yeast AP-1 homolog (37Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). Exposure to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, which induces the transcription of many stress response or detoxification genes, also resulted in a 3.4-fold increase in the amount of AFT2transcripts (38Jelinsky S.A. Samson L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The phenotypic analysis presented herein indicates that theaft1-mediated mutant phenotypes are exacerbated by the deletion of AFT2 and are suppressed by the overproduction of Aft2p. Moreover, some phenotypes related to oxidative stress do not occur in the simple aft1 and aft2 mutants but are clearly present in the double aft1aft2 mutant. These results suggest that Aft2p has functions that overlap those of Aft1p in the regulation of iron metabolism pathways. We are presently developing a global analysis to identify the putatives AFT target genes that are involved in these pathways.

They mediate their biological effects by binding to heptahelical receptors which interact with and signal through heterotrimeric G proteins. Several chemokine receptors, most notably CXCR4 and CCR5, also serve as coreceptors for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),1 which together with CD4 facilitate viral entry into target cells (2Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Natural ligands of the CCR5 receptor include the CC chemokines RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and MCP-2. Ligand binding to CCR5 induces the activation and dissociation of pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric G proteins, which, in turn, activate phospholipase Cβ isoforms (3Raport C.J. Gosling J.

This results in a transient increase in intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and cytosolic calcium. RANTES binding to chemokine receptors on T-lymphocytes activates both classical G protein signaling pathways as well as pertussis toxin-resistant protein tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways (4Bacon K.B. Premack B.A. Gardner P. Schall T.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1727-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to CCR5 was also shown to initiate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, which result in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) (5Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite good evidence for a significant role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ in these processes (6Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Jones R.G. Oliveira d.S.A. Stanford W.L. Bolon B. Wakeham A. Itie A.

Rapid modulation of signaling at the level of the receptor may be critical for the ability of chemokine receptors to sense small changes in chemokine concentrations as cells move along chemoattractant gradients. Several studies have tested the concept that receptor deactivation and internalization are essential for chemotaxis, although with contrasting results (8Ben-Baruch A. Bengali K.M. Biragyn A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Previously, we and others have shown that CC chemokines induce the rapid phosphorylation of CCR5 on carboxyl-terminal serine residues by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) and protein kinase C (12Aramori I.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 3037-3044PubMed Google Scholar). By analogy with other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), β-arrestins are thought to bind to the phosphorylated receptor and thereby sterically interfere with further G protein coupling. In addition to attenuating receptor signaling, β-arrestins also act as adapter proteins that facilitate clathrin-mediated endocytosis of certain G protein-coupled receptors (15Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). A role for β-arrestins in CCR5 internalization has been suggested previously by the ability of functionally active or dominant-negative β-arrestins to modulate receptor internalization in a differential way (12Aramori I. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Cullen B.R. Caron M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that β-arrestins fulfill additional functions in GPCR signaling as scaffolding proteins, which recruit components of MAPK cascades into multiprotein signaling complexes (16Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Thereby, β-arrestins connect certain G protein-coupled receptors to the activation of ERK1/2 or JNK/SAPK. Whether this is a mechanism that also applies to CCR5-mediated mitogenic signaling is an open question. Many GPCRs have been shown to be post-translationally modified by palmitoylation at cysteine residues in their carboxyl-terminal domains. Palmitoylation modifies GPCR signaling in ways that appear to vary among different receptors (for a review, see Ref. 17Jin H. George S.R. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Benovic J.L. Sibley D.R. Strader C.D. Regulation of G Protein-Coupled Receptor Function and Expression. Wiley-Liss, New York1999: 93-117Google Scholar). CCR5 contains three carboxyl-terminal cysteines, which conform to a predicted palmitoylation site. Whether this lipid modification of the receptor is relevant for normal CCR5 function has not been studied in detail. In order to analyze the role of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the CCR5 receptor for ligand binding, signal transduction, and receptor internalization, we generated several receptor mutants with progressive carboxyl-terminal truncations of the receptor or with selective alanine mutation of amino acid residues at defined positions. These receptor mutants allowed us to investigate the functional significance of post-translational modifications and of specific conserved sequence motifs that are located in the CCR5 carboxyl-terminal domain.

[3H]Palmitic acid and 125I-RANTES were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; Amplify and Hyperfilm-3H were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; protease and kinase inhibitors were from Calbiochem; 2-bromopalmitate was from Fluka; all other reagents, unless otherwise indicated, were from Sigma. The cDNA of either wild type CCR5 or phosphorylation-deficient receptor mutant CCR5-SSSS/AAAA (13Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with a mutagenic 5′ primer containing a HindIII site and a 3′ primer, which replaces the CCR5 stop codon with a BamHI restriction site. The restricted fragments were inserted in frame into the polylinker of pECFP-N1 (clontech). Rat β-arrestin with EYFP conjugated to its carboxyl terminus (β-arrestin-EYFP) was constructed by replacing the terminal stop codon of β-arrestin (18Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M.

Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed on pEF-BOS-CCR5 (13Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) using the Gene Editor kit (Promega) according to instructions by the manufacturer to generate cysteine to alanine replacement mutants. The CCR5 truncation mutants were generated by inserting stop codons at various positions within the CCR5 carboxyl-terminal domain using site-directed mutagenesis. The CCR5-LL/AA, CCR5-LL/AA-SSSS/AAAA, and CCR5-Y/A replacement mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated overlap extension technique. Coding sequences of all mutated cDNAs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. All CCR5 truncation and replacement mutants were stably expressed in RBL-2H3 cells using the pEF-BOS expression vector together with the phβAPr1-neo plasmid as described previously (13Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). By the same technique, a RBL-CCR5,C5aR cell line was generated which stably expressed wild type CCR5 together with the C5a anaphylatoxin receptor (C5aR). RBL cells expressing either wild type or mutant CCR5 were incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 16 h. Cells were then labeled for 4 h with 4 ml of RPMI 1640, 0.1% BSA and [3H]palmitic acid (400 μCi/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h. Prior to use, [3H]palmitic acid was dried under nitrogen and redissolved in a minimal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide. After treatment with 50 nm RANTES or medium alone for 15 min at 37 °C, cells were washed once with cold PBS and solubilized in detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS with protease inhibitors as described (Ref. 19Oppermann M.

Receptors were immunoprecipitated by the incubation of precleared cellular lysates with 20 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody and protein G-Sepharose. Receptors were eluted by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in SDS sample buffer und subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. After fluorography with Amplify™, gels were dried and exposed to Hyperfilm-3H at −80 °C for 8 weeks. To ensure loading of equivalent amounts of receptors per lane of the gel, aliquots from each sample were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibody (T21/8), 2M. Oppermann, unpublished data. which reacts with a CCR5 amino-terminal epitope and an enhanced chemiluminescence-based detection system. The effect of RANTES stimulation on [3H]palmitate incorporation into the receptor was quantitated by densitometric analysis (ImageMaster TotalLab software;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) of digitized images of autoradiograms and enhanced chemiluminescence films. The phosphorylation of CCR5 in intact cells was determined as described (13Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, RBL cell lines expressing wild type or mutant CCR5 were metabolically labeled with 32Pi, treated with either PMA or RANTES, and phosphorylated CCR5 were routinely immunoprecipitated with FLAG M2 antibodies. For the purification of CCR5 and C5aR from cells that co-express both receptors, we employed antibodies (T21/8, S5/1; Serotec) with specificity for amino-terminal epitopes on the respective receptors. To be able to compare phosphorylation of the different receptor mutants, the same amount of surface expressed receptors, determined by flow cytometry, was applied to each lane of 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Quantitation of receptor phosphorylation was done by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). HEK-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transiently transfected with either CCR5-ECFP or CCR5-SSSS/AAAA-ECFP alone or in combination with β-arrestin-EYFP (10 μg/100-mm dish) by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique. Assays were performed 36–48 h after transfection; transfection efficiencies as judged by flow cytometry ranged from 45 to 85%. Cells were detached by mild trypsinization or incubation (10 min) with PBS plus 10 mm EGTA on ice, washed in fetal calf serum-containing medium, resuspended in PBS, and immediately measured for FRET using a Spex Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorometer. Exposure of cells to trypsin for brief periods of time (10–15 s) was found not to affect CCR5 signaling or FRET measurements. At various time points after addition of a saturating concentration of RANTES, the samples were excited at 424 nm, which represents the excitation maximum of ECFP. Emission spectra were collected from 450 to 600 nm and corrected for background fluorescence. Data are represented in a modification of the method used by Angerset al. (20Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar) as FRET ratios, which are defined as [(emission at 526 nm) − (emission at 475 nm) × cf]/(emission at 475 nm), where cf is the ratio (emission at 526 nm)/(emission at 475 nm) of CCR5-ECFP expressed in HEK-293 cells alone and in the absence of stimulus. Equilibrium competition binding assays were carried out by analyzing the displacement of 125I-MIP-1α from CCR5-expressing RBL cells by unlabeled ligand, and IC50values were calculated as described (21Proudfoot A.E. Power C.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Montjovent M.O. Borlat F. Offord R.E. Wells T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2599-2603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The internalization of 125I-RANTES by RBL-2H3 cells that express wild type or mutant CCR5 was determined by following a protocol by Signoret et al. (22Signoret N. Marsh M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 138: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, RBL-CCR5 cells were grown to 70% confluence in 24-well plates and were incubated with binding medium (BM: RPMI 1640 without bicarbonate, 0.2% BSA, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4) containing 125 pm125I-RANTES for 90 min at 4 °C. Unbound chemokines were removed by washing at 4 °C. Cells were incubated with 37 °C BM for different times (0, 3, 10, or 30 min) to initiate internalization. In half of the wells for each time point, surface-bound radioligand was removed by two 3-min acid washes with RPMI 1640, BSA, 10 mm MES, pH 2.5. All cells were washed again with 4 °C BM. The specific radioligand uptake was calculated as acid-resistant counts in 0.1 nNaOH extracts of acid-washed cells divided by the total cell-associated activity in cells washed at pH 7.4 after subtraction of nonspecific binding at time 0. The assay for RANTES-inducedN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase release from CCR5-expressing RBL-2H3 cells has been described before (23Montz H. Fuhrmann A. Schulze M. Götze O. Cell. Immunol. 1990; 127: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Values (mean ± S.E.) were expressed as a percentage of total enzyme present in cells after lysis with 0.1% Triton X-100, and data were analyzed using nonlinear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose-response model by Sigma-Plot software (SPSS). Agonist-dependent intracellular calcium mobilization was measured in transfected RBL-2H3 cells as described (13Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To calculate the decrease in intracellular calcium concentrations after RANTES stimulation, we applied a mathematical analysis previously used by Christophe et al. (24Christophe T. Rabiet M.J. Tardif M. Milcent M.D. Boulay F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1656-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Calcium decays from 80% of the peak height to basal levels were fitted to an exponential (a + be-t/τ ) ,where the time constant τ reflects the ability of CCR5 variants to evoke a more or less sustained calcium response. CCR5-mediated activation of MAPK pathways was determined in serum-starved cells grown in six-well dishes, which were stimulated for 5 or 15 min with 50 nm RANTES. Cellular lysates in Laemmli buffer were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with a 1:1000 dilution of monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2, rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-p38, or rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-JNK/SAPK antibodies (New England Biolabs). After visualization of immune complexes by enhanced chemiluminescence, the membranes were stripped and reprobed for total cellular MAPKs with polyclonal rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (Calbiochem), anti-p38, or anti-JNK/SAPK (New England Biolabs) antibodies. Subsequent quantitation of phospho-MAPK immunoblots was normalized to the total amount of MAPK present using scanning laser densitometry and ImageMaster TotalLab software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chemotaxis assays were performed on stably transfected RBL-2H3 cells using 48-well chemotaxis chambers (Neuroprobe) and polycarbonate filters with a 12-μm pore size. Briefly, 5 × 104cells in 50 μl of RPMI 1640, 1% BSA were seeded in the upper compartment and the lower compartment was filled with 27 μl of RANTES diluted in the same medium. The chamber was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 moist atmosphere, membranes were then removed, and the number of cells that passed through the membrane were quantified by staining with a Diff-Quik kit and counting the number of cells present in three microscope fields (20× objective). All experiments were performed in quadruplicate and repeated at least three times. To study the functional role of the CCR5 carboxyl-terminal domain, which encompasses a total of 51 amino acid residues, we generated a series of truncation variants with progressive deletions of the COOH-terminal portion of the receptor (Fig. 1). These receptor constructs lack the carboxyl-terminal 18, 24, 31, 38, 43, or 47 residues of the native receptor and were designated by “T” followed by the position of their carboxyl-terminal amino acid. All truncation mutants lack the four COOH-terminal serine residues, which we previously identified as the exclusive phosphorylation sites on CCR5 for GRKs and PKC (13Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To directly address the potential significance of post-translational receptor modifications, site-specific CCR5 mutants were generated with alanine exchange of the four carboxyl-terminal serine phosphorylation sites at positions 336, 337, 342, and 349 (CCR5-SSSS/AAAA) and of three adjacent and potentially palmitoylated cysteine residues at positions 321, 323, and 324 (CCR5-CCC/AAA). Additionally, the two adjacent leucine residues at positions 308 and 309, which form a potential AP-2 binding motif, were alanine-mutated either alone (CCR5-LL/AA) or together with the four serine phosphorylation sites (CCR5-LL/AA-SSSS/AAAA). A receptor with alanine replacement of Tyr-297 in transmembrane domain VII (CCR5-Y/A) had previously been reported to be impaired in its ability to signal and to undergo agonist-induced sequestration (12Aramori I. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Cullen B.R. Caron M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and was included in this study for control purposes. The wild type and mutant CCR5 cDNAs were transfected into RBL cells and stable clones derived by selection with G418. Receptor expression at the cell surface was tested by flow cytometry using a monoclonal antibody (Q10/19),2 with specificity for a CCR5 epitope. The mutants were expressed at levels comparable to wild type receptor, except for the truncation mutant T304, which had significantly less receptor expression at the cell surface. This defect in cell surface expression was reproducibly observed in several independent RBL cell clones as well as in transfected HEK-293 cells. The CCR5-T304 mutant was, however, strongly expressed within cells at levels comparable to wild type CCR5 when receptors were detected by immunofluorescence in saponin-permeabilized cells (data not shown). The ability of RBL cells to incorporate [3H]palmitic acid into CCR5 wild type or a COOH-terminal truncation mutant (CCR5-T320) of the same receptor was examined by metabolic labeling experiments. The receptors were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.2, only cells that express wild type receptor incorporated [3H]palmitic acid into a 40-kDa protein, which corresponds to mature CCR5. In contrast, no radioactivity was associated with the CCR5 truncation mutant, which lacks three carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues. Immunoblotting with an antibody that reacts with a CCR5 amino-terminal epitope confirmed expression of both receptors at equivalent levels. Since palmitoylation of proteins occurs through covalent modification of cysteine residues, this result implies that palmitoylation of CCR5 occurs through formation of thioester bonds with up to three adjacent cysteine residues at positions 321, 323, and 324, which are located in the receptor's carboxyl terminus in close proximity to transmembrane domain VII. Since palmitoylation of other G protein-coupled receptors was shown to be modulated by external stimuli, we investigated the possible effect of short term RANTES stimulation on the extent of CCR5 palmitoylation. When RBL-CCR5 cell were exposed to RANTES for 15 min, the electrophoretic mobility of the receptor decreased, a phenomenon that previously was found to be correlated with ligand-induced CCR5 phosphorylation (13Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to RANTES did not modulate [3H]palmitate incorporation into the receptor (94 ± 7% of the signal obtained with unstimulated wild type cells;n = 3) in a significant manner when radiolabel incorporation was normalized to receptor expression levels, as determined by immunoblotting and scanning laser densitometry. Using a series of receptor mutants that were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, we had shown previously that four distinct CCR5 carboxyl-terminal serine residues are phosphorylated upon RANTES stimulation by a GRK-mediated mechanism (13Oppermann M. Mack M. Proudfoot A.E. Olbrich H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8875-8885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3, a CCR5-SSSS/AAAA mutant with alanine replacement of all four relevant carboxyl-terminal serine residues stably expressed in RBL cells was not phosphorylated following treatment with either RANTES or PMA. To investigate the functional significance of receptor palmitoylation, we generated cell lines that express a palmitoylation-deficient mutant with alanine substitution of all three COOH-terminal cysteine residues. Despite the presence of intact COOH-terminal phosphorylation sites, normal cell surface expression, and ligand binding affinity, no significant chemokine- or PMA-induced phosphorylation of the CCR5-CCC/AAA mutant with alanine mutation of the three potential palmitoylation sites was observed, and basal levels of receptor phosphorylation were also reduced as compared with wild type CCR5. Although similar mutational approaches have been frequently used in other receptor systems to address the functional significance of protein palmitoylation, the possibility remains that the observed effects are due to loss of the cysteine residue per se, rather than loss of the palmitate. We therefore used 2-bromopalmitate as an inhibitor of receptor palmitoylation and investigated its effects on dually transfected RBL cells, which stably express wild type CCR5 together with C5aR. Human C5aR lack carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues and are, therefore, presumably not palmitoylated. After treatment with 2-bromopalmitate, RBL-CCR5,C5aR cells were incubated with PMA or the respective agonists and phosphorylation of the two receptors was monitored in parallel by immunoprecipitation with CCR5- or C5aR-specific monoclonal antibodies. Flow cytometry revealed that 2-bromopalmitate has no effect on cell surface expression levels of both receptors. Pre-treatment with the palmitate analogue profoundly reduce"

Both genetic and environmental factors influence its development, and understanding the pathogenesis of complications such as vascular lesions and end-organ damage may lead to more specific treatment and targeted intervention.We have identified candidate loci in rats that may contribute to target organ damage and mortality in malignant hypertension (MH),1 a condition characterized by an accelerated rise in blood pressure, endothelial injury, activation of the reninangiotensin system, and microangiopathy (1Kantachuvesiri S.

Most animal models of MH to date require surgical or pharmacological intervention to precipitate onset or depend on the constitutive expression of endogenous genes or heterologous transgenes (2Byrom F.B.

In most of these models, the onset of disease cannot be determined precisely.The initiation events of pathological processes can only be studied in an animal model in which hypertension is induced by tightly temporally regulated gene expression. If the onset and level of hypertension can be controlled, then the cellular and molecular events during initiation of the vascular and organ injury can be identified unequivocally. Reversibility of the gene expression provides an opportunity to study the molecular and cellular basis of repair. We therefore have generated inbred transgenic rats with inducible hypertension using the cytochrome P450 promoter, Cyp1a1, to drive expression of the mouseRen-2 gene. The transgene is expressed primarily in the liver and is rendered inducible by xenobiotics such as indole-3 carbinol (I3C) (7Loub W.D. Wattenberg L.W. David D.W. J. Natl.

I3C is a naturally occurring agent found in cruciferous vegetables that acts as a benign inducer with a short biological half-life.We demonstrate that transgene expression and hypertension can be regulated in a dose-dependent and reversible manner. Vascular remodeling is observed consistently, and characteristic responses in different vascular beds are seen in the early phase of MH development. The availability of rats with inducible hypertension should provide a basis for detailed studies of the molecular and cellular events occurring during the progression and repair of hypertensive vascular damage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimalsRats were given free access to water and standard commercial rat chow containing 0.32% NaCl (Special Diet Services, Witham, Essex, UK). The breeding, maintenance, and study of animals were performed according to home office regulations.Generation of Transgenic RatsThe rat Cyp1a1 promoter was isolated byNotI-SalI double digestion of pAhIR1-LacZ (kindly provided by R. C. Wolf, University of Dundee) to yield an 11.5-kilobase fragment containing 5′-flanking regions exon 1 and part of exon 2. This was placed upstream of Ren-2 cDNA and an SV40 poly(A) signal in pBluescript SK2(+) (see Fig. 1a) (10Ogg D. Ph. D. thesis. University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland1997Google Scholar). The injection fragment was excised by NotI-BssHII digestion and was introduced into Fischer F344 single-cell embryos by microinjection as described (11Mullins J.J. Ganten D. J. Hypertens. 1990; 8: S35-S37Google Scholar, 12Paul M. Wagner J. Hoffman S. Urata H. Ganten D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 811-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Founders were identified by Southern blot hybridization after restriction digestion of genomic DNA with EcoRI and hybridization with the Ren2 cDNA probe (Fig. 1b). Animals from line TGR(Cyp1a1Ren2) (formally named TG10) were normotensive by tail-cuff plethysmography and radiotelemetry and were used for detailed study. The remaining lines, which exhibited varying degrees of hypertension in the absence of inducer, were not studied further.Transgene ExpressionTransgene expression was assessed by Northern blot hybridization analysis using total RNA isolated from frozen tissue by the RNAZOL method (13Chomczyski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar) and full-length Ren-2 cDNA as a hybridization probe.RadiotelemetryDirect blood pressures were monitored by telemetry using a surgically implanted transmitter (Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN). The signal was decoded using Dataquest IV 2.2 software to give systolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate data.Induction of Transgene Expression by Indole-3 Carbinol (I3C)Single Dose InductionBlood was collected from adult rats by retro-orbital bleeding under halothane anesthesia. Induction was then initiated by gastric gavage of 150 mg/kg of I3C in sesame oil (50 mg/ml) at day 0 under light halothane anesthesia. The animals were allowed to recover and given free access to standard food and water. At days 1, 3, and 5 after gavage, blood was collected under halothane anesthesia (n = 5, each group), and tissues were collected.Continuous InductionTransgenic and nontransgenic animals (10–12 weeks old) were given standard powdered food (Special Diet Services, Witham, Essex, UK) for 24 h before the experiment. I3C (0.3% (w/w)) was then mixed with the rat food (in a small amount of water), and individually caged rats were given ∼25 g daily and free access to drinking water. The animals were culled at days 4, 7, and 14 after induction when blood and tissues were collected.Plasma CollectionBlood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding or cardiac puncture into 0.1 volumes of ice-cold 100 mm EDTA for the renin and aldosterone assays or into 1:40 volume of ice-cold inhibitor mixture (4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/μlO-phenanthroline, 0.16 mg/ml captopril, 40 μg/ml pepstatin, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25 m sodium EDTA, pH 8.0) for angiotensin II measurement. The samples were centrifuged (4 °C for 6 min), and plasma was snap-frozen and stored at −70 °C prior to the assay.Tissue HomogenatesAfter perfusion with 0.9% NaCl, the tissues were collected and homogenized in 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, containing 0.1m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm EDTA and centrifuged (100 × g at 4 °C for 10 min) to remove debris and unbroken cells. After further centrifugation (50,000 × g for 30 min) the resultant supernatants were stored at −80 °C prior to renin analysis.Renin and Prorenin DeterminationActive and inactive renin concentrations were determined as described previously (14Peters J.

The samples were incubated with lyophilized renin substrate (80 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, and the Ang I concentration was then measured by radioimmunoassay (15Schelling P. Ganten U. Sponer G. Unger T.

Chem. 1988; 34: 1046-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For plasma renin concentration, the samples were incubated directly with substrate. Addition of the specific renin inhibitor CH-732 (17Peters J. Kranzlin B. Schaeffer S. Zimmer J. Resch S. Bachmann S. Gretz N. Hackenthal E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 34: E439-E450Google Scholar) (10−6 m, a gift from M. Szelke, Ferring Research Institute, Southampton, UK) confirmed the specificity of the reactions. Protein content of the samples was determined using a commercial kit (Bio-Rad).Specific Immunoprecipitation of Mouse ReninTo determine the percentage of mouse renin present in plasma samples, immunoprecipitation of mouse renin was carried out as described previously (14Peters J. Munter K. Bader M. Hackenthal E. Mullins J.J. Ganten D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) using a monoclonal anti-mouse renin antibody (no. 120, provided by M. R. Celio, Universite Perolles, Fribourg, Switzerland) that showed <3% cross-reactivity to purified rat renin. Antibody/renin complexes were precipitated with formalin-fixedStaphylococcus aureus protein A (immunoprecipitation, no. 9321 SB, Life Technologies, Inc.). The renin activities were determined before and after immunoprecipitation.Plasma Aldosterone, Angiotensin I, and Angiotensin IIPlasma aldosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay after extraction and chromatography as described previously (18Meier G. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1988; 75: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For angiotensin II determinations, the plasma samples were processed by Sep-Pak elution (Walter GmbH, Eschborn, Germany) and were then analyzed by radioimmunoassay for Ang II (19Oster P. Hackenthal E. Hepp R. Experientia (Basel). 1973; 29: 353-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cross-reactivity of angiotensin antibodies are as follows: Ang II with Ang I, 0.02%; Ang I with Ang II, <0.01%; and Ang I with angiotensinogen, <0.2%. Ang I was also measured as described previously (34Kantachuvesiri S. Ph.D. thesis.

Subsequent complex formation with l-His-l-Leu was measured using a fluorescence spectrometer (RF-1502, Shimadzu).In Situ HybridizationIn situ hybridizations were performed as described previously (22Peters B.

Throughout all experiments the sense probes did not produce any detectable signal.PathologyOrgans were removed and fixed in 10% formal saline for 24 h and processed to paraffin block, and 4-μm sections were cut and stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), periodic acid-Schiff, and Martius Scarlet Blue (MSB) as reported previously (24Whitworth C.E.

The arteries were then stained with the nuclear dye, propidium iodide, and morphology was determined with confocal microscopy (514-nm EX, 550-nm EM) and metamorph software (25Arribas S.M. Gonzalez C.

Differences between groups were evaluated by analysis of variance followed by the post hoc test of Bonferroni. Onlyp values less than 0.05 were accepted to indicate a significant difference.RESULTSOf six transgenic founders identified, TG10 (subsequently named TGR(Cyp1a1Ren2)) and its progeny were normotensive in the absence of inducer, suggesting that the Cyp1a1-Ren2 transgene (Fig.1a) had integrated into a neutral genomic site. A Y chromosome integration site was suggested by Southern blot hybridization and pedigree analysis (Fig. 1, band c) and was confirmed by fluorescent in situhybridization analysis (data not shown).Continuous InductionTransgenic and nontransgenic male rats were induced with 0.3% (w/w) dietary I3C for 2 weeks. Severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure = 200 mm Hg) developed in the transgene-positive animals within 1 week of treatment and was sustained throughout the period of administration (Fig.2a), whereas the nontransgenic controls remained normotensive. Transgenic animals showed clinical signs of severe hypertension including weight loss and polyuria by day 4 of induction, and their condition deteriorated over a 2-week period (average weight loss of 22%). The cessation of I3C administration at days 7 and 14 resulted in the normalization of blood pressure and clinical improvement within 72 h (data not shown).Figure 2a, telemetric recording of blood pressure in transgenic (Tg+) and nontransgenic (Tg−) rats (10–12 weeks old, n = 4–5 each) induced with dietary 0.3% I3C for 2 weeks.

After 7 days of induction all components of the plasma RAS were increased in transgenic animals in comparison to induced nontransgenic controls. Plasma prorenin concentration was increased >200-fold, whereas plasma renin concentration increased 2-fold. Increasing plasma angiotensin II levels were found (day 7, 136.9 ± 13.4 versus82.9 ± 25.5 ng/ml (p = 0.06, n = 11 and 8); day 14, 657 ± 208 versus 116 ± 117.9 ng/ml (p < 0.05, n = 4 each)), and plasma aldosterone was also higher (day 7, 43.5 ± 7.85versus 9.7 ± 1.5 ng/100 ml (p = 0.0017, n = 8 and 7)). The immunoprecipitation of renin-2 with mouse renin-specific antibody revealed that the majority of plasma renin was transgene-derived (65.8 ± 18.2% of renin concentration, n = 8) after dietary I3C induction. Because post-induction steady-state levels of renin mRNA were suppressed markedly in the kidneys of transgenic animals compared with controls (Fig. 2c), these findings confirmed that circulating renin was predominantly extrarenal in origin. The expression of Ren-2 was detected in the liver and small intestine after 14 days of continuous I3C induction but not in the spleen, heart, kidney, lung, adrenal gland, aorta, or skin (data not shown).The effect of RAS activation in the adrenal gland was studied by thein situ hybridization of CYP11B1 andCYP11B2 genes (Fig. 2d). No difference in the hybridization signal of CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 was found between groups prior to induction, but after 14 days it increased the CYP11B2 hybridization signal and higher numbers of expressing cells were observed in the zona glomerulosa of transgenic animals, reflecting the stimulatory effect of angiotensin II on aldosterone synthesis. No difference in CYP11B1 expression, in the zona fasciculata, was observed between induced transgenic and nontransgenic rats.Pathological changes were observed in transgenic animals induced for 14 days but not in induced controls or transgenic rats prior to induction. A slight medial thickening of renal interlobular arteries and distal tubular hyperplasia was observed in transgenic rats by day 4 of I3C induction, and some showed fibrinoid necrosis (fibrin deposition in the vascular wall and transmural necrosis of vascular smooth muscle cells) of small arteries in the mesentery and heart. By day 7, histological evidence of malignant hypertension was observed throughout the mesenteric and coronary arteries (Fig. 3) with focal fibrinoid necrosis of small arteries. Microinfarction, as evidenced by patchy areas of myocardial necrosis in both the left and right ventricles, was seen with infiltration of inflammatory cells and proliferation of fibroblasts. Despite clear evidence of vascular injury in the mesentery and heart, there was no apparent fibrinoid necrosis in the kidney, although interlobular and arcuate arteries showed medial thickening of the vessel walls (Fig. 3). There was also hyperplasia of distal renal tubules, which might be the result of polyuria, pressure natriuresis, and high aldosterone. No evidence of MH or parenchymal lesions was observed in the brain.Figure 3Kidneys from induced Tg− (A) and uninduced Tg+ (B, day 0) show normal glomeruli (g) tubules (t), interlobular artery (ia), and afferent arteriole (aa). C, by day 7 of I3C induction, the interlobular artery shows luminal reduction and medial thickening of the wall. D, after 14 days there is evidence of malignant vascular injury with fibrinoid necrosis (fn) and endarteritis obliterans (eo). Hearts from induced Tg− (E) and uninduced Tg+ animals (F) with normal bundles of cardiac myocytes (cm) and coronary arterioles (ca) are shown. G, by day 7 of I3C induction, severe cardiac pathology, with fibrinoid necrosis (fn) of coronary arterioles and myocardial microinfarction (mi), occurs. H, after 14 days, early organization (org) of microinfarct with inflammatory infiltrate and fibroblast proliferation. The mesenteric artery (ma) histology of induced Tg− (I) and uninduced Tg+ animals (J, day 0) is normal. K, by day 7 of I3C induction, endarteritis obliterans (eo) affects peripheral mesenteric arteries and fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles is seen at bowel wall (data not shown). L, after 14 days, continuing fibrinoid necrosis of arterioles (fn) at serosal surface of intestine and early organization (org) with inflammatory infiltrate and elsewhere fibroblast proliferation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)After 14 days of induction, the kidney vessels showed endarteritis obliterans of interlobular arteries and afferent arterioles (Fig. 3). Widespread lesions of MH and tissue injury with chronicity (inflammatory cell and fibroblast proliferation) were observed in the mesentery and heart (Fig. 3). Brain histology was normal with no evidence of brain hemorrhage, infarction, or destructive vessel pathology. Immunohistochemical staining using a human albumin antibody showed a positive signal confined to the intravascular compartment, suggesting vascular integrity (data not shown).Morphological studies on the mesenteric resistance arteries of the induced hypertensive rats (Fig. 4) revealed an increase in the total number of adventitial cells (p < 0.001) but not in smooth muscle or endothelial cells. There was a statistically significant increase in the media thickness (p < 0.05) and in the media/lumen ratio (p < 0.05). There was a significant increase in the density of adventitial cells (p < 0.01) and a significant decrease in the density of smooth muscle cells in the media (p < 0.05), suggesting that the mesenteric vasculature undergoes eutrophic remodeling. No changes were observed with respect to the width of the vascular wall, the adventitia, the intimal layers, the lumen diameter, or in the wall/lumen ratio.Figure 4Morphometric analysis of mesenteric resistance arteries determined by confocal microscopy. a, a significant increase in media thickness (but not of total wall, adventitial, or intimal layers) is seen between Tg− and Tg+ rats after induction (p < 0.05). b, a significant increase in the media/lumen ratio (p < 0.05) but not in the wall/lumen ratio is seen. c, a significant increase in total cell number (p < 0.05) and particularly adventitial cell number is seen (p < 0.001) but not in smooth muscle cells. d, cell density in the adventitia increased significantly (p < 0.01), whereas medial smooth muscle cell (SMC) density decreased significantly (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Short-term InductionBecause I3C has a short biological half-life (26Stresser D.M. Williams D.E. Griffin D.A. Bailey G.S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1995; 23: 965-975PubMed Google Scholar), we evaluated the reversibility of short term I3C induction. Prior to induction there was no difference in systolic blood pressure (as measured by radiotelemetry) between nontransgenic and transgenic animals. The administration of I3C by gastric gavage produced a dose-dependent increase in systolic blood pressure (Fig. 5). At the highest dose administered (150 mg/kg), the blood pressure change was detected by 12 h after induction, reaching the maximum blood pressure of 160 mm Hg by 24 h and returning to normal by 72 h. No clinical symptoms or pathological changes were observed during this short period of induction, and I3C had no effect on blood pressure in nontransgenic rats.Figure 5a–c, the administration of I3C (70, 100, or 150 mg/kg) by gastric gavage produced a dose-dependent increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (by telemetric recording).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Northern blot and RNase protection analyses of liver total RNA failed to detect Ren-2 mRNA before induction. Expression was detected 24 h after induction (150 mg/kg), but Ren-2 mRNA was again undetectable after 72 h (data not shown). The highly significant increase in plasma prorenin at 24 h declined by day 3 and dropped to baseline by day 5, concomitant with the change in blood pressure (Fig. 6). Detailed studies during the first 24-h period revealed that plasma prorenin was increased significantly within 6 h (51.2 ± 4.6 ng Ang I/ml/hr (0 h); 244.4 ± 35.5 (6 h); 1121.3 ± 221.2 (12 h); 1065.6 ± 118.9 (18 h); n = 6 each). There was no statistically significant change in plasma RAS in either transgenic or nontransgenic animals after single bolus induction. However, both prorenin and renin concentrations were increased significantly in transgenic liver and heart tissue homogenates after 24 h (Fig.7).Figure 6a–d, plasma prorenin, renin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II concentrations after a single dose of I3C gastric gavage in Tg+ and Tg− rats.

Because the transgene was integrated on the Y chromosome in line TGR(Cyp1a1Ren2), it precludes the study of hypertension in females, but nevertheless the model has wide applicability. Hypertension is induced rapidly in a dose-dependent manner as a consequence of transgene expression and can be reversed in the absence of sustained induction.Ren-2 gene expression was detected in liver within 24 h of but not prior to I3C induction. Noninduced transgenic animals are indistinguishable from Fischer F344 controls with respect to plasma renin concentration, angiotensin concentration, blood pressure, and adrenal aldosterone synthase expression.A continuous dietary administration of I3C resulted in sustained hypertension, high circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activity, and clinical manifestations of malignant hypertension including polyuria and weight loss (a consequence of salt and water depletion). The immunoprecipitation of mouse renin indicated that the high plasma renin concentration was primarily transgene-derived, whereas in situ hybridization revealed suppression of kidney renin mRNA in the induced transgenic animals (presumably as a result of negative feedback (27Schunkert H. Ingelfinger J.R. Jacob H. Jackson B. Bouyounes B. Dzau V.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E863-E869PubMed Google Scholar)), confirming that the kidney was not the source of high circulating renin.Short-term kinetics studies of plasma and tissue RAS suggest that prorenin uptake and activation by tissues may be implicated in the development of hypertension. During short-term induction plasma prorenin was induced >20-fold without any change in plasma ren"

Importin-α contains the NLS binding site, whereas importin-β mediates the translocation through the nuclear pore. We characterized the interactions involving importin-α during nuclear import using a combination of biophysical techniques (biosensor, crystallography, sedimentation equilibrium, electrophoresis, and circular dichroism). Importin-α is shown to exist in a monomeric autoinhibited state (association with NLSs undetectable by biosensor). Association with importin-β (stoichiometry, 1:1; KD = 1.1 × 10−8m) increases the affinity for NLSs; the importin-α/β complex binds representative monopartite NLS (simian virus 40 large T-antigen) and bipartite NLS (nucleoplasmin) with affinities (KD = 3.5 × 10−8m and 4.8 × 10−8m, respectively) comparable with those of a truncated importin-α lacking the autoinhibitory domain (T-antigen NLS, KD = 1.7 × 10−8m; nucleoplasmin NLS,KD = 1.4 × 10−8m). The autoinhibitory domain (as a separate peptide) binds the truncated importin-α, and the crystal structure of the complex resembles the structure of full-length importin-α.

Most macromolecules require an active, signal-mediated transport process that enables the passage of particles up to 25 nm in diameter (∼25 MDa). The first and best characterized nuclear targeting signals are the classical nuclear localization sequences (NLSs)1 that contain one or more clusters of basic amino acids (1Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). NLSs do not conform to a specific consensus sequence and fall into two distinct classes termed monopartite NLSs, containing a single cluster of basic amino acids, and bipartite NLSs, comprising two basic clusters. Despite the sequence variability, the classical NLSs are recognized by the same receptor protein termed importin or karyopherin, a heterodimer of α and β subunits (for recent reviews see Refs. 2Christophe D.

Importin-α contains the NLS-binding site, and importin-β is responsible for the translocation of the importin-cargo complex through the pore. Transfer through the pore is facilitated by the proteins Ran (Ras-related nuclear protein) and nuclear transport factor-2. Once inside the nucleus, importin-β binds to Ran-GTP to effect the dissociation of the import complex; the importin subunits return to the cytoplasm separately and without the cargo. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This distribution is in turn controlled by various Ran-binding regulatory proteins. Importin-α consists of two structural and functional domains, a short basic N-terminal importin-β-binding (IBB) domain (7Gorlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E.

Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1996; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The monopartite NLSs bind at a major site located between the first and fourth Arm repeats and additionally at a minor site spanning repeats 4–8 (11Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J.

Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The bipartite NLSs span the two binding sites, with each site recognizing one of the basic clusters (12Conti E. Kuriyan J.

The linker sequence between the two basic clusters makes few contacts with the receptor, consistent with its tolerance to mutations. The affinity of the importin-targeting sequence interaction is a critical parameter in determining transport efficiency (3Jans D.A. Xiao C.Y. Lam M.H. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The structure of mouse importin-α showed that in the absence of importin-β or NLS-containing proteins, a part of the IBB domain occupies the major NLS-binding site (14Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, it was suggested that the IBB domain acts as an intrasteric autoregulatory sequence (15Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), explaining the regulatory switch between the cytoplasmic, high affinity form and the nuclear, low affinity form for NLS binding (14Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This model is supported by the observed increase in affinity for NLSs of importin-α upon importin-β binding (16Rexach M. Blobel G.

In this study we use a combination of biophysical techniques to characterize the various binding and regulatory events occurring during nuclear import. The association state of individual importin subunits and the complex is characterized by sedimentation equilibrium and gel electrophoresis, the interactions involving importin-α are characterized using the biosensor, and the structure of the IBB/autoinhibitory domain and its interaction with the Arm repeat domain of importin-α are analyzed by x-ray crystallography and circular dichroism spectroscopy.

For expression, bacteria were grown at 37 °C to anA600 of 1.2 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST-free proteins were generated by thrombin cleavage (23Imamoto N.

Prior to biosensor, circular dichroism, and sedimentation equilibrium experiments, the proteins were further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Impα(70–529) protein used for crystallization experiments was expressed as a hexahistidine-tagged protein and purified as described previously (13Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol.

The peptides PKKKRKV (T-Ag NLS, corresponding to the NLS of the SV40 large T-antigen, residues 126–132) and KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK (nucleoplasmin NLS, corresponding to the NLS of nucleoplasmin, residues 155–170) with an N-terminal biotin group, and the peptide DEQMLKRRNVS (corresponding to residues 44–54 of mouse importin-α) were synthesized using the Applied Biosystems 433A peptide synthesizer, purified by cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse phase chromatography, and analyzed by quantitative amino acid analysis (Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer) and electrospray mass spectrometry (Sciex API 111; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (24Michell B.J.

The protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm as calculated from the amino acid composition (ProtParam). Protein homogeneity was checked prior to kinetic studies using micropreparative size exclusion chromatography (Superose 12 column HR 3.2/30) connected to a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All measurements were performed using a BIAcore2000 biosensor (BIAcore AB). Importin-α, importin-β, IBB domain, and anti-GST IgG were immobilized onto a carboxymethyldextran sensor chip using NHS/EDC coupling as described previously (25Catimel B. Ritter G. Welt S. Old L.J.

GST-importin-β and GST-IBB were captured onto immobilized anti-GST IgG, and biotinylated NLS peptides were immobilized onto streptavidin-coated surfaces according to protocols described previously (26Fridman M.

The samples for analyses were prepared at various concentrations in HBS buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20) and were injected (30 μl) over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 10 μl min−1. Following completion of the injection phase, dissociation was monitored in HBS buffer for 150 s at the same flow rate. Bound proteins were eluted, and the surface was regenerated between injections, using either 30 μl of 10 mm HCl or 10 mm NaOH. Regeneration conditions did not denature the immobilized antigen as shown by equivalent signals upon reinjection of the ligand. The apparent association and dissociation rate constants were calculated using BIAevaluation version 3.0 (BIAcore AB) as described previously (28Nice E.C. Catimel B.

Open table in a new tab Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a Ti60 rotor and filled-epon centerpieces (path length, 12 mm). Sedimentation equilibrium profiles for importin-α and importin-β at starting concentrations of 0.5 mg ml−1 were obtained at 20 °C, using rotor speeds of 10,000 and 15,000 rpm. The final equilibrium distributions, determined from absorption measurements at 280 nm, were fitted globally to obtain best fit values for the molecular weight. The complex formed between importin-α and importin-β was isolated by size exclusion chromatography (Superose 200; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sedimentation equilibrium distributions obtained at 20 °C, using a rotor speed of 10,000 rpm. Partial specific volumes for importin-α and importin-β (0.74 ml g−1) were calculated from the amino acid composition; the solvent density of S buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1.8 mm potassium phosphate, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7.3) was calculated to be 1.007 g ml−1. Spectra of the IBB domain were recorded at 20 °C using the IBB domain at a concentration of 0.108 mg ml−1 in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7), with an Aviv model 62DS spectrophotometer, 1-mm path-length quartz cuvettes, 1.5 nm bandwidth, 2 s integration time, and 0.5 nm wavelength increments from 185 to 260 nm. The spectra were corrected with a base line obtained using buffer alone under the same conditions. For crystallization, Impα(70–529) was concentrated to 18.8 mg ml−1 using a Centricon-30 (Millipore) and stored at −20 °C. Crystallization conditions were screened by systematically altering various parameters using the crystallization conditions for other peptide complexes (13Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) as a starting point. The crystals (rod shaped, 0.3 × 0.1 × 0.07 mm) were obtained using co-crystallization, by combining 2 μl of protein solution, 1 μl of peptide solution (1.7 mg ml−1; peptide/protein ratio, 2.5), and 2 μl of reservoir solution and suspended over 0.5 ml of reservoir solution containing 0.6m sodium citrate as the precipitant (pH 6.5) and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The crystals exhibited orthorhombic symmetry (space group P212121; see Table III). Diffraction data were collected from single crystals transiently soaked in a solution corresponding to the reservoir solution but supplemented with 23% glycerol and flash cooled at 100 K in a nitrogen stream (Oxford Cryosystems), using a MAR Research image plate detector (plate diameter, 345 mm) and CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator. The data were auto-indexed and processed with the HKL suite (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Electron density maps calculated with coefficients 3‖Fobs‖ − 2‖Fcalc‖ and simulated annealing omit maps (see Fig. 5) calculated with analogous coefficients were generally used. The model was improved, as judged by the free R factor (31Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3860) Google Scholar), through rounds of crystallographic refinement (positional and restrained isotropic individual B factor refinement, with an overall anisotropic temperature factor and bulk solvent correction), and manual rebuilding (program O) (32Jones T.A.

Asn239 is an outlier in the Ramachandran plot as also observed in all other structures of mouse importin-α (13Fontes M.R.M. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol.

The final models comprise 426 importin-α residues (residues 72–497) and 16 peptide residues. The structure determination statistics are shown in Table III. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 1IQ1). The quality of the models was checked with the program PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The contacts were analyzed with the program CONTACT (34CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar), and the buried surface areas were calculated using the program CNS (30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was used to determine the oligomeric state of purified importin-α and importin-β (Fig.1). The linearity of the lnc versus r2 plots (c is the optical density at 280 nm, and r is the radial distance) for both proteins indicate single sedimenting species. Global analysis of sedimentation equilibrium data obtained at 10,000 and 15,000 rpm gives values for the molecular weights of importin-α and importin-β of 60,100 and 99,000, respectively. These values correspond closely to the subunit molecular weights of importin-α (60,294) and importin-β (97,130), suggesting that both proteins are monomeric under these conditions. The complex formed between importin-α and importin-β was isolated as a single major peak from gel filtration chromatography. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of this sample (Fig. 1) indicated minor molecular weight heterogeneity represented by the deviations from linearity. The slope of the straight line drawn through the data yields an estimate for the weight average molecular weight of the complex of 148,200, consistent with a 1:1 complex. The stoichiometry of binding was further analyzed by gel electrophoresis, by comparing the relative intensities of the protein bands of the complex, as isolated by size exclusion chromatography, with the relative intensities of importin-α and -β mixed in varying ratios; these experiments also suggested 1:1 stoichiometry of binding (data not shown). Surface plasmon resonance was used to characterize the apparent association (ka) and dissociation (kd) constants of the importin-α-importin-β interaction. Initially, importin-β was covalently linked to the flexible dextran matrix of a carboxymethyldextran sensor chip via amine coupling (∼9,000 resonance units (RU) corresponding to 9 ng mm−2) (35Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczki J. J. Colloid Interface. 1990; 43: 513-526Google Scholar). However, the resulting surface gave only a weak nonspecific signal upon importin-α injection, even at concentrations up to 1 μm (data not shown). This suggested that importin-β was not immobilized in an active orientation for importin-α binding. To attain an optimal presentation for importin-α binding, GST-tagged importin-β was captured onto the sensor chip using an immobilized anti-GST antibody. Because the GST-importin was desorbed during regeneration, this required reloading the surface prior to each analysis. The amount of importin-β captured at each cycle was ∼500 RU, varying from 525 RU at the first injection to 485 RU after 10 injections. This small variation in captured antigen was probably due to a minor loss of reactivity of the immobilized anti-GST antibody (IgG) upon regeneration between cycles. This slight difference in surface levels between cycles precluded global analysis for this data set, with each curve having to be analyzed separately using nonlinear least squares regression analysis. The binding curves (Fig. 2 A) fitted poorly using the simple 1:1 Langmuirien model (A + B ⇄ AB), suggesting complex kinetics. This was not unexpected considering the available structural information; the IBB domain needs to dissociate from the Arm repeat domain of importin-α before binding importin-β, simultaneously undergoing conformational changes upon importin-β binding (14Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 36Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W.

Therefore, a two-state reaction model appeared appropriate for the analysis of the binding curves. This model gave an excellent fit (Fig.3 A) compared with other models tested. The analysis of each individual curve, generated using a range of concentrations (337.5–5.25 nm) gave similar results (values ranging from 3.9–6.6 × 105m−1 s−1 forka1, 1.5–1.9 × 10−2s−1 for kd1, 6.7–8.4 × 103m−1 s−1 forka2, and 2.1–3.2 × 10−3 s−1 forkd2) resulting in an apparentka1 = 4.9 × 105m−1 s−1,kd1 = 1.7 × 10−2s−1 (for the reaction A + B ⇄ AB), andka2 = 7.9 × 103m−1 s−1, andkd2 = 2.5 × 10−3s−1 (for the rearrangement AB ⇄ AB*). These values resulted in an apparent dissociation constant KD = 1.1 × 10−8m (TableI).Figure 3Analysis of the BIAcore binding data.The experimental data are indicated by solid lines, and the fitted data are indicated by open circles.

In a high throughput screen designed to identify transcripts that are actively translated during cardiac hypertrophy, we identified a number of genes with established links to hypertrophy, including those coding for Sp3, c-Jun, annexin II, cathepsin B, and HB-EGF, thus showing the general utility of the screen. Focusing on a candidate transcript that has not been previously linked to hypertrophy, we found that protein levels of the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase andtensin homologue on chromosome ten) were increased in the absence of increased messenger RNA levels. Increased PTEN expression by recombinant adenovirus in cultured neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes caused cardiomyocyte apoptosis as evidenced by increased caspase-3 activity and cleaved poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase. Expression of PTEN was also able to block growth factor signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate pathway. Surprisingly, expression of a catalytically inactive PTEN mutant led to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, with increased protein synthesis, cell surface area, and atrial natriuretic factor expression.

Causes of hypertrophy include hypertension, myocardial infarction, endocrine disease, and mutations in components of the contractile apparatus that impair pump function (1Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Cell. 2001; 104: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Initial hypertrophy may be beneficial, alleviating chamber wall stress and increasing cardiac output, but chronic stimulation can lead to cardiomyopathy, decompensation, and failure. The molecular pathways invoked during this pathological progression are only now being defined, but it is already clear that no single effector is responsible for the observed alterations in cardiac gene expression, apoptosis, and fibrosis. In addition to mechanical stresses, many recently identified ligands, including adrenergic signals, peptide growth factors, and cytokines can evoke cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Under certain conditions, the same factors that induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, such as insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1)1 and calcineurin (2MacLellan W.R. Schneider M.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar,3MacLellan W.R. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 2000; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), can also influence cell survival. Hence, extrinsic stimuli on the cardiomyocyte surface are no longer thought to necessarily evoke a linear signaling cascade to the nucleus or contractile machinery but rather to feed into a “signaling web,” with many components and nodal points of control (4Jordan J.D. Landau E.M. Iyengar R. Cell. 2000; 103: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). One protein that has received recent attention and functions at such a convergent signaling nodal point, is PTEN. The human tumor suppressor gene PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1(PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome ten; MMAC1,mutated in multiple advancedcancers-1; TEP1, TGF-β-regulated,epithelial cell-enrichedphosphatase) is either deleted or inactivated in a high percentage of breast, endometrial, brain, and prostate cancers (5Li J.

PTEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase with homology to the focal adhesion-associated protein tensin (13Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J. Wang S.I. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). In vitro, PTEN can dephosphorylate acidic polypeptides, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and the adaptor protein Shc. However, the major in vivosubstrate for PTEN may be phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), because embryonic fibroblasts taken from PTEN null mouse strains have abnormally high levels of PIP3 and are resistant to apoptosis (12Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W.

These fibroblasts, as well as several breast cancer and glioblastoma-derived cell lines, show extremely high levels of activated Akt, a serine/threonine kinase that is regulated by PIP3 and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate (14Ramaswamy S.

Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In work spanning worms to mammals, PTEN has been defined genetically and biochemically to act as a negative regulator of Akt in opposition to the evolutionarily conserved IGF-1/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (17Goberdhan D.C.

Transcriptome and proteome analyses of general biological processes are beginning to yield a general picture of normal and altered cell states (20Lockhart D.J. Winzeler E.A.

We have used a modified transcriptome approach to examine those transcripts that are actively translated during cardiac hypertrophy. In the course of this screen, PTEN emerged as a strong candidate. In this study, we demonstrate that PTEN is differentially expressed during cardiac hypertrophy, and show that altered expression can impact on cardiomyocyte viability. PTEN can also function as a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and survival. A PTEN mutant, H123Y, exhibits dominant-negative activity in cardiomyocytes, leading to increased Akt activation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of a true dominant negative activity for a PTEN mutant in cultured cardiomyocytes and should contribute toward understanding the potential consequences of human tumorigenic PTEN mutations in other cell types. All cell culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. unless otherwise stated. Antibiotics, insulin-transferrin-selenite, bromodeoxyuridine, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit and tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies, and monoclonal anti-α-actinin antibody were from Sigma Chemical Co. Other primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-PTEN (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.); monoclonal anti-Pk-TAG (anti-V5) (Serotec); monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Chemicon); rabbit anti-ANF (Peninsula Laboratories, Inc); rabbit anti-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology); and rabbit anti-pS473Akt (BIOSOURCE International). FVB/N mice were infused with 60 mg/kg/day isoproterenol or 0.02% acetic acid (vehicle only as control) for 14 days. Crude heart homogenates from either six control or isoproterenol-treated mice were fractionated on 10–40% sucrose gradients, and fractions were continuously monitored for absorbance at 260 nm. The material in the polysome fractions, which sedimented at >80 S was defined as “translated”, while the RNA present in the fractions containing the single ribosomes, ribosomal subunit fractions, and non-sedimented material was defined as “untranslated.” The resulting RNA fractions were then reverse-transcribed, 32P-labeled, and hybridized to four individual CLONTECH Atlas 1.2 Macroarray filters, and the signals were quantified by using a PhosphorImager. For each array position that had a signal greater than 0.5× the median filter value and a signal on all four membranes, a ratio was calculated as shown below in Fig. 1. Total mouse heart or brain homogenates were prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μl/ml PMSF, 10 μl/ml sodium orthovanadate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete protease inhibitor tablet, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad assay in triplicate, and the proteins were separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE before transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PTEN antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at a 1:2000 dilution or monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (Chemicon International, Inc.) at a 1:5000 dilution were used to probe the membranes before detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and the ECL-Plus chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The luminescence signals were quantified on a Storm 860 device (Molecular Dynamics). The experiment was repeated four separate times with similar results, and results were analyzed by Student'st test. Two hundred nanograms of total RNA from adult FVB/N mouse heart was used in a single-tube reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Titan, Life Technologies) to amplify PTEN cDNA. The sense primer was 5′-AGGCTCCCAGACATGACAGCCATC-3′ (bases 937–960 of PTEN cDNA, GenBank™ accession number U92437), and the antisense primer was 5′-ACTTTTGTAATTTGTGAATGCTGATC-3′ (bases 2156–2131). To place a peptide tag on the COOH terminus of expressed protein to allow detection, amplified PTEN cDNA was cloned in-frame into the pUni/V5-His TOPO Echo expression plasmid (Invitrogen) to create pWTPTENV5TOPO. This allowed fusion at the COOH terminus to a 14-amino acid peptide derived from the SV5 Paramyxovirus(V5 epitope) and a 6xHis tag. Site-directed mutagenesis to create the H123Y substitution was performed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and the following complementary oligomers spanning bases 1300–1332: 5′-CAT GTT GCA GCA ATT TAC TGT AAA GCT GGA AAG-3′ and 5′-CTT TCC AGC TTT ACA GTA AAT TGC TGC AAC ATG-3′. Plasmids pWTPTENV5TOPO (WTPTEN) and pH123YPTENV5TOPO (H123YPTEN) were sequenced to verify integrity. Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated using the Worthington Cardiomyocyte Isolation System with minor modifications as follows. Cardiomyocytes from 1-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat pup hearts were isolated by overnight incubation with trypsin at 4 °C followed by a 50-min, 37 °C collagenase digestion as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were preplated for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM/F-12 medium, 15 mm HEPES, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 1 μg/ml gentamicin to allow adherence of non-cardiomyocytes. Cells remaining in the supernatant were pelleted and resuspended in 1:1 medium consisting of DMEM/F-12, 15 mm HEPES, 5% horse serum, 2.5 μg/ml insulin, 2.5 μg/ml transferrin, 2.5 ng/ml sodium selenite, 30 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine, and 1 μg/ml gentamicin. Viable cardiomyocytes, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, were plated at 250 cells/mm2 on ProNectin-F-coated plastic cultureware (4 μg/ml coating solution in 1× PBS; BIOSOURCE International) and grown for 12–18 h in 1:1 medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For virus infection, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 infectious units (ifu)/cell for 1 h in DMEM/F-12 at 37 °C. Cells were allowed to recover for 12 h in 1:1 medium before being placed into DMEM/F-12 for the remainder of the culture period, usually 24–48 h. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown in 4-well-chambered Permanox slides (Nalge Nunc) coated with ProNectin-F. Primary antibodies were used at 1:100 dilution on cells fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/1× PBS and permeabilized in 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm Pipes (pH 6.9), 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses were made using the AdEasy system described by He et al. (1998).XhoI-XbaI restriction fragments from either pWTPTENV5TOPO or pH123YPTENV5TOPO, spanning the cloned insert and tag, were ligated into XhoI-XbaI-digested pShuttleCMV. To create AdLacZ, a NotI-NotI restriction fragment from pCMVβ (22MacGregor G.R. Caskey C.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) was ligated to NotI-digested pShuttleCMV. Recombination into the pAdEasy-1 viral backbone was accomplished in bacteria as described previously (23He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T., Yu, J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Recombinant pAdEasy plasmids containing CMV-cDNA inserts were purified over Qiagen columns and 4 μg of PacI-digested DNA was used to transfect HEK293 cells by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). Cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells per 25-cm2 flask 24 h prior to transfection. Lysis of transfected cells indicating adenoviral growth occurred by 4 days. Following amplification, lysates containing clonal recombinant adenovirus were prepared from 10 75-cm2 flasks and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation. Recovered virus was aliquoted and stored at −20 °C in 5 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 25% glycerol. Virus was titered by serial dilution infection of HEK293 cells and counting of plaques under 0.3% agarose/10% fetal bovine serum/1× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overlay. Duplicate 100-mm plates seeded with 1.96 × 106 cardiomyocytes were either mock infected or infected with AdlacZ, AdWTPTEN, or AdH123YPTEN at an m.o.i. = 10 ifu/cell. After 48 h, cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor tablet, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Recombinant PTEN proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates with anti-V5 antibody for 1 h, and the precipitate was treated with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.7), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm MgCl2, followed by a wash in phosphatase assay buffer lacking PIP3 (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm DTT). The phosphatase reactions were done as described previously (24Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Akagi T. Shishido T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10182-10187Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated PTEN proteins were incubated in a 50-μl reaction with phosphatase assay buffer and 200 μm water-soluble diC8-PIP3(Echelon) for 40 min at 37 °C in a 96-well plate. Released phosphate was determined by Biomol Green Reagent (Biomol) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and absorbance was determined at 650 nm. The amount of free phosphate released was calculated from a standard curve analysis. The positive control used was 2.5 μg of recombinant purified PTEN protein (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). Cardiomyocytes were seeded at 250 cells/mm2 in 6-well culture dishes 12 h prior to viral infection. Twenty-four h following infection (or mock treatment) cardiomyocytes transduced with AdlacZ, AdWTPTEN, or AdH123YPTEN were incubated for 6 h in leucine-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5 μCi/ml [3H]leucine. Cells were washed, and the proteins were precipitated with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid then washed again with cold 95% ethanol, and the lysates were collected in 0.5n NaOH for scintillation counting. Genomic DNA was extracted from duplicate samples in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m EDTA (pH 8.0), 20 μg/ml RNase, and 0.5% SDS, incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, then extracted in phenol:chloroform before ethanol precipitation. Recovered nucleic acid was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm and used to control for cell number. Relative cell surface area was calculated from digitized cell images taken from random fields of view using National Institutes of Health IMAGE software (version 1.62). At least 100 cells were counted per sample, and statistical analysis was carried out using Student's ttest. Four 100-mm plates were seeded with 1.96 × 106 cardiomyocytes for each sample. Cells were mock infected, infected with AdlacZ, AdWTPTEN, AdH123YPTEN, or treated with 0.5 μm staurosporine for 6 h prior to harvest. Trypsinized cells were scraped from the plates and counted. 1 × 106 cells from each sample (in duplicate) were lysed and used in a 100-μl reaction with 50 μm of the colorimetric DEVD-pNA substrate in 1× reaction buffer as per the manufacturer's instructions (Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assay kit,CLONTECH). Five μm of the irreversible caspase-3 inhibitor, DEVD-fmk, was used as a control for specificity. The colorimetric reaction products were determined at 400 nm. Duplicate 100-mm plates seeded with 1.96 × 106 cardiomyocytes were either mock infected or infected with AdlacZ, AdWTPTEN, or AdH123YPTEN at an m.o.i. = 10 infectious units/cell. For a positive control mock infected cells were treated with 10 nm of IGF-1 for 15 min prior to harvest. Where indicated AdWTPTEN-infected cells were also treated with 10 nm IGF-1 in the same manner. For a negative control, cells were treated with 10 μm of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technology) for 45 min prior to and during IGF-1 treatment. Cells were harvested 48 after infection in 1 ml of 1× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF). Two hundred microliters of lysate was then used for immunoprecipitation of Akt using 20 μl of immobilized anti-Akt antibody slurry (Akt kinase assay kit, Cell Signaling Technology). Pellets were washed twice in lysis buffer, then twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2), before initiating the reaction with the addition of 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of GSK-3 fusion peptide. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, then terminated with 3× SDS sample buffer, and the reaction products were separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the phosphorylated GSK-3α/β fusion peptide was detected with anti-pGSK-3 antibody (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology). Cardiomyocytes were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 250 cells/mm2 18 h prior to infection with adenovirus. Cells were mock infected or infected with AdlacZ, AdWTPTEN, or AdH123YPTEN at an m.o.i. of 10 ifu/cell for 1 h at 37 °C, allowed to recover for 12 h in 1:1, then placed into 100 μl of DMEM/F-12 without phenol red. At indicated time points, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT was added to the cells, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Solubilization of the converted purple formazan dye was accomplished by placing cells in 100 μl of 0.01 n HCl/10% SDS and incubating overnight at 37 °C. The reaction product was quantified by absorbance at 570 nm. All samples were done in triplicate, and data were analyzed by Student's t test. We initially sought to define genes that are differentially expressed during cardiac hypertrophy. Chronic isoproterenol (ISO) infusion in mice is a simple and well-characterized protocol that results in a characteristic 20–30% cardiac hypertrophy as measured by heart to body weight ratios (25Kudej R.K. Iwase M. Uechi M. Vatner D.E. Oka N. Ishikawa Y. Shannon R.P. Bishop S.P. Vatner S.F. J Mol Cell Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2735-2746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To increase the probability of finding genes that were altered at the level of protein expression, polysomes derived from mouse ventricles were loaded on sucrose gradients and size-fractionated using velocity density centrifugation (Fig. 1 A). Fractions were taken and the ventricular RNA isolated to select for the transcripts that were loaded onto polysomes in response to ISO (26Zong Q. Schummer M. Hood L. Morris D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10632-10636Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Four CLONTECH Atlas 1.2 macroarray filters were simultaneously hybridized to radiolabeled cDNA probes that were derived from either vehicle-treated (control) free or polysome-bound RNA, or from ISO-treated free or polysome-bound RNA (Fig. 1). For each array element, a numerical value for the shift to polysomes was calculated by taking the ratio of ISO bound/free signal divided by the ratio of vehicle bound/free signal. Signals were normalized to the median filter value to correct for differences in probe specific activities. A value of >1 indicates an increase for that transcript in the polysome fraction due to chronic ISO infusion. A typical block of array elements from the four filters (Fig. 1 B) shows that the tumor suppressor PTEN (arrow) and the collagen IX α-2 subunit (arrowhead) undergo a 3.3-fold and 6.8-fold shift to polysomes, respectively (Table I). Beta actin and GAPDH were invariant. Interestingly, although the candidate genes exhibited a wide range of polysome shifts (∼2- to 90-fold) almost all of the candidates exhibited only modest changes in total RNA amounts between control and hypertrophic hearts (0.6- to 5-fold) (Fig.2, A and B). The lone exception was the serine/threonine kinase pim-1, which normally is most highly expressed in myeloid cells (27Selten G. Cuypers H.T. Berns A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The candidate genes cover a spectrum of cellular functions such as signaling, cell architecture, transcription, proteolysis, and phosphorylation (Table I).Table ICandidate genesNo.Gene productFunctionΔRNAΔPolysome-fold 1IL-1 receptorCell signaling0.83.1 2Galanin precursorCell signaling1.33.4 3HBEGFCell signaling0.98.8 4Inhibin-αCell signaling0.82.6 5Collagen 1Xα2Cytoskeleton1.26.8 6SkeleminCytoskeleton0.623.6 7Epas-1Transcription0.63.4 8mnt/roxTranscription1.32.6 9NFAT 1αTranscription1.12.810ParaxisTranscription0.916.211Sp3Transcription1.82.112deltaEF-1Transcription0.92.313HPRTDNA synthesis0.916.214LCATTransport0.888.615Calcyclin binding proteinModulator0.636.316HCKModulator1.02.917p58IPKModulator1.25.318Annexin II light chainModulator0.813.419rab2Modulator1.73.020A-rafKinase0.733.421c-junTranscription0.83.822GPCR 27Receptor1.78.723pim-1Kinase5.33.224Cathepsin B1Protein Turnover0.92.425Cathepsin CProtein Turnover1.39.426Cathepsin DProtein Turnover0.716.2275HTR2cReceptor0.94.928PTENTumor suppressor1.13.329GPX3Stress1.23.3GAPDHMetabolism1.20.9α-ActinCytoskeleton10.8The GAPDH and β-actin “housekeeping” transcripts do not show appreciable changes. Open table in a new tab The GAPDH and β-actin “housekeeping” transcripts do not show appreciable changes. Apparent transcript loading into heavy polysome complexes could be the result of either a block to translation elongation and hence decreased protein expression, or an increase in translation initiation and a resultant rise in protein production. One of the candidates, PTEN, has been linked to growth and metabolism of many cell types. Therefore, we hypothesized that it may play a similar role in the heart. Although the data in Fig. 2 showed that a number of transcripts exhibited a more robust response to isoproterenol stimulation, we undertook a detailed examination of PTEN to obtain a better understanding of the screening's general value, and because of the involvement of PTEN in cell cycling in other systems. Quantitative Western blot analyses showed that PTEN protein expression is, in fact, induced in ISO-treated mouse hearts relative to vehicle-treated hearts (Fig. 3), in agreement with the polysome-derived data. Taken together with the shift of PTEN mRNA into the heavy polysome fractions during hypertrophy and the minimal change of total PTEN mRNA, this finding is consistent with regulation of PTEN expression by increased translational initiation. To address the consequences of altered PTEN expression in the heart, recombinant adenoviruses expressing wild-type PTEN or the catalytically inactive H123YPTEN mutant (13Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J. Wang S.I. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) were used to infect neonatal rat primary cardiomyocytes in culture (Fig.4). In uninfected cells or cells infected with a control virus expressing lacZ, endogenous PTEN exhibits a punctate pattern in the cytosol or plasma membrane and also is present in the nucleus (Fig. 4 A). Overexpression of wild-type PTEN resulted in fewer cells remaining on the plate 48 h post infection, with many of the cells detached and floating (Fig.4 B). Within 48 h nearly 80% of the cells had died as determined by an MTT survival assay (Fig.5 A). To address whether cell death was due to apoptosis, caspase-3 enzymatic activity was measured in cell lysates 24 h post recombinant virus infection of neonatal cardiomyocytes. Caspase-3 is a key “executioner” of apoptosis and is responsible for many proteolytic cleavage events in apoptotic cells (28Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Although expression of lacZ or H123YPTEN did not alter caspase-3 activity, expression of wild-type PTEN led to a significant increase in caspase-3 activity that could be blocked with a specific caspase-3 inhibitor (Fig."

Also serine 20-phosphorylated p53 was coimmunoprecipitated with Plk3 in cells treated with H2O2. Furthermore, although H2O2 strongly induced serine 15 phosphorylation of p53, it failed to induce serine 20 phosphorylation in Plk3-dificient Daudi cells. Ectopic expression of a Plk3 dominant negative mutant, Plk3K52R, in GM00637 cells suppressed H2O2-induced serine 20 phosphorylation.

ROS are potentially mutagenic and may be involved in activation of protooncogene and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (1Akman S.A. O'Connor T.R. Rodriguez H. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Oxidative signals, either external or internal, are thought to be detected by sensor molecules and mediated by cellular signal transduction systems, which eventually results in cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis in normal diploid fibroblast cells.

In fibroblast cells, p53 protein level is increased upon H2O2 treatment, and the level of p53 is correlated with replicative senescence and apoptosis (7Chen Q.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 908: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the p66shc−/− cells, p53 activation and its target gene p21 expression are impaired in response to oxidative stress (8Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). However, a p53-independent pathway that mediates H2O2-induced G2/M growth arrest has also been reported (9Lotem J. Peled-Kamar M. Groner Y. Sachs L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9166-9171Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Members of the Polo family of protein kinases, conserved through evolution, have been characterized in yeast (10Kitada K.

The founding member of this family, Polo, was originally identified in the fruit fly and was shown to be a serine-threonine kinase required for mitosis (12Fenton B. Glover D.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain at least three proteins (Plk1, Plk2, and Plk3) that exhibit marked sequence homology to Polo (14Donohue P.J. Alberts G.F. Guo Y. Winkles J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10351-10357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 15Simmons D.L. Neel B.G. Stevens R. Evett G. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell.

As cells progress through the cell cycle, Plk proteins undergo substantial changes in abundance, kinase activity, or subcellular localization. In human cells, the amounts of Plk1 protein and its kinase activity peak at mitosis (18Hamanaka R. Smith M.R. O'Connor P.M. Maloid S. Mihalic K. Spivak J.L. Longo D.L. Ferris D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21086-21091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). During mitosis, Plk1 transiently associates with mitotic structures such as the spindle apparatus, kinetochores, and centrosomes (20Bloecher A. Tatchell K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Plk1 contributes to a variety of mitotic (or meiotic) events, including activation of cyclin B-Cdc2, breakdown of the nuclear membrane, centrosome maturation, and formation of the bipolar spindle at the onset of mitosis (21Descombes P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1328-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 22Qian Y.W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell.

Plk1 also controls the exit of cells from mitosis by regulation of the anaphase-promoting complex (24Kotani S. Tugendreich S. Fujii M. Jorgensen P.M. Watanabe N. Hoog C. Hieter P. Todokoro K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 371-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Plk3 shows little resemblance to Plk1 with regard to function in mammalian cell cycle regulation. Thus, the abundance of Plk3 remains relatively constant during the cell cycle, and its kinase activity peaks during late S and G2 phases (25Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Plk3 phosphorylates Cdc25C on serine 216, resulting in inhibition of the activity of this protein (25Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of Cdc25C by Plx1, a Xenopus Plk1 ortholog, results in activation of this protein (13Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Polo family kinases also participate in the response to DNA damage (26Cheng L. Hunke L. Hardy C.F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7360-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). For example, Cdc5, a budding yeast ortholog ofDrosophila polo, promotes adaptation to cell cycle arrest at the DNA damage checkpoint (29Toczyski D.P. Galgoczy D.J. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 1097-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility of Cdc5 in denaturing gels is affected by prior subjection of cells to DNA damage, and this modification is dependent on Mec1, Rad53 (a yeast Chk1 homolog), and Rad9 (26Cheng L. Hunke L. Hardy C.F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7360-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, a functionally defective Cdc5 mutant protein suppresses a Rad53 checkpoint defect, whereas overexpression of Cdc5 overrides checkpoint-induced cell cycle arrest (27Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), suggesting that Cdc5 acts downstream of Rad53. Moreover, DNA damage appears to interfere with the activation of Plk1 in mammalian cells, resulting in down-regulation of the kinase activity of this protein. In contrast, expression of dominant negative mutants of Plk1 overrides the induction of G2 arrest by DNA damage (28Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). We have been studying the biological role of polo-like kinase-3 (Plk3, previously named Prk) during normal and abnormal cell growth (17Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T. Slamon D.J. Arceci R.

Here we report that ROS induces activation of Plk3 as well as p53, which is correlated with p53 phosphorylation on multiple serine sites. Activation of both Plk3 and p53 is ATM-dependent. In addition, we have obtained experimental evidence strongly suggesting that Plk3 mediates ROS-induced serine 20 phosphorylation of p53. Various cell lines, including ATM-deficient cell line (ATCC number CRL-1702), were purchased from ATCC. CRL-1702 has been characterized as ATM−/− (32Chaturvedi P. Eng W.K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Lu Q. Faucette L.F. Scott G.F. Li X. Carr S.A. Johnson R.K. Winkler J.D. Zhou B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4047-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). GM00637 cell line (human fibroblast) was originally from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research. HeLa, A549, GM00637, DU145, LNCap, and PC-3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 μg/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) with 5% CO2. DAMI, HEL, and HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, and Daudi cells were culture in McCoy's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics as above. Cells treated with H2O2 (200 μm unless otherwise specified) or adriamycin (100 μm) were collected and lysed (25Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In some experiments, caffeine (2 μm) was supplemented to the cultured cells for 30 min prior to the treatment with H2O2 or adriamycin. Equal amounts (40 μg) of protein lysates from the treated cells were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with antibodies (New England Biolabs) to phosphorylated p53 (specifically phosphorylated on serine 9, serine 15, or serine 20), p21, or Bax. The same blots were also stripped and reprobed with antibodies to regular p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signals were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed essentially as described previously (25Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In brief, A549 cells were exposed to H2O2 (200 μm) for various times, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Plk3. The resulting precipitates were resuspended in a kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10 μm MnCl2, 5 mmMgCl2), and the kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (2 μCi) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and α-casein (Sigma). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Recombinant His6-Plk3, produced and purified as described previously (25Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30Ouyang B. Li W. Pan H. Meadows J. Hoffmann I. Dai W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), was assayed for kinase activity as a positive control. In some kinase assays, GST-p53 was incubated with His6-Plk3 or His6-Plk3K52R in the kinase buffer supplemented with “cold” ATP. After reaction, Plk3-phosphorylated GST-p53 samples, as well as nonphosphorylated GST-Plk3, were blotted for serine 20 phosphorylation. GM00637 cell lysates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a total volume of 500 μl with of 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose bead slurry (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After removal of the beads, the supernatant was supplemented with either rabbit polyclonal (PharMingen) or mouse monoclonal antibodies to Plk3, or with control immunoglobulins followed by incubation with constant agitation for overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose beads (20 μl) were then added to each immunoprecipitation mixture, and the incubation was continued for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with the cell lysis buffer, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibodies to serine 20-phosphorylated p53. GM00637 cells were transfected, using the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.), with constructs expressing Plk3 or Plk3K52R25 or with the vector pCR592. One day after transfection, cells were treated with or without H2O2 for 30 min. Cell lysates were prepared and blotted for Plk3, p53, or serine 20-phosphorylated p53. Although recent studies have shown that phosphorylation of p53 plays an important role in stabilization and activation of this tumor suppressor protein in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) or UV (6Caspari T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R315-R317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 33Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which ROS-induced p53 accumulation/activation remains unclear (34Uberti D. Yavin E. Gil S. Ayasola K.R. Goldfinger N. Rotter V. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 65: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine whether ROS activates p53 through phosphorylation, GM00637D cells were exposed to H2O2 for various times, and p53 phosphorylation status was analyzed by immunoblotting using phospho-specific antibodies. Fig. 1A shows that upon H2O2 treatment, p53 was rapidly phosphorylated on serine 20 and serine 15 in GM00637D cells. Serine 9 phosphorylation was also induced with a slow kinetics (Fig.1A, lane 5). However, serine 392 phosphorylation was not detected (data not shown). These results indicate that p53 accumulation upon oxidative stress as reported by von Harsdorf and Dietz (35von Harsdorf R. Li R.F. Dietz R. Circulation. 1999; 98: 2934-2941Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar) is at least partly due to phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15 and serine 20, because these two residues are located within the domain of the protein that interacts with HDM2 (human ortholog ofmurine double minute-2 protein, MDM2), resulting in stabilization of the normally short-lived p53 protein in response to the stress (36Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and activation of p53 upon challenge with genotoxic stress such as IR and UV often results in cell cycle arrest (6Caspari T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R315-R317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In fact, the trans-activation by p53 of genes such as those encoding p21 and Bax proteins is thought to be responsible at least in part for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, respectively, in cells subjected to genotoxic stress (37Chan T.A. Hwang P.M. Hermeking H. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1584-1588PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether H2O2-induced p53 phosphorylation is correlated with its functional activation, we measured expression of its target genes p21 and Bax. Fig. 1B shows that 5 h after H2O2 treatment, the p21 protein level began to increase (lane 2) and that 7 h post-treatment it was more than quadrupled (lane 3) compared with the untreated control (lane 1). On the other hand, little increase in Bax protein levels were observed in cells treated with H2O2. DNA damage caused by IR activates p53 through phosphorylation on multiple residues, and this activation is ATMdependent (33Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar). To determine whether ROS-induced p53 phosphorylation was also ATM-dependent, we treated GM00637 cells with caffeine, an ATM/ATR inhibitor, prior to exposure of the cells to H2O2 or IR-mimetic drug adriamycin. Fig.2A shows that caffeine (CFN) partially blocked H2O2-stimulated phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15 and serine 20 (lanes 2 and 5), whereas it completely inhibited adriamycin (ADR)-induced phosphorylation of p53 on all three residues (lanes 3 and6). These observations suggest that p53 activation by ROS is at least in part dependent on ATM and/or ATR. To further confirm that ATM was important in mediating p53 phosphorylation by H2O2, we exposed ATM-deficient CRL-1702 cells to H2O2. Fig. 2B shows that in the ATM-deficient cells after H2O2 treatment enhancement in phosphorylation of p53 on neither serine 20 nor serine 15 was observed, indicating that ROS-induced phosphorylation and activation of p53 is ATM-dependent. Our laboratory has been studying human Plk3, which is involved in regulating cell cycle progression (17Li B. Ouyang B. Pan H. Reissmann P.T. Slamon D.J. Arceci R. Lu L. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19402-19408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 25Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 30Ouyang B. Li W. Pan H. Meadows J. Hoffmann I. Dai W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As an initial step to identify protein kinase(s) responsible for phosphorylation of p53 induced by ROS, we examined the possibility of Plk3 activation by H2O2, because Plk3 phosphorylates the same residue of Cdc25C (serine 216) as that targeted by Chk1 and Chk2. Chk1 and Chk2 are also reported to phosphorylate p53 on serine 20 (38Haggman M.J. Wojno K.J. Pearsall C.P. Macoska J.A. Urology. 1997; 50: 643-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Kagan J. Stein J. Babaian R.J. Joe Y.S. Pisters L.L. Glassman A.B. von Eschenbach A.C. Troncoso P. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2121-2126PubMed Google Scholar). A549 cells, expressing good levels of Plk3, were treated with ROS for various times. Plk3 immunoprecipitated from the treated cells was analyzed for its kinase activity using casein as substrate as described previously (25Ouyang B. Pan H. Lu L. Li J. Stambrook P. Li B. Dai W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28646-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Fig.3A shows that compared with the control (lane 1) Plk3 kinase activity was rapidly activated in A549 cells (lane 2) and maintained for at least 1 h. To determine whether Plk3 activation was ATMdependent, CRL-1702 cells treated with H2O2 were collected, and Plk3 immunoprecipitates were assayed for Plk3 kinase activity. Fig.3B shows that whereas recombinant Plk3 phosphorylated casein effectively (lane 4), no difference in Plk3 kinase activity was detected between untreated control (lane 1) and H2O2-treated CRL-1702 cells (lane 2), suggesting that Plk3 activation also requires ATM. In addition, Plk3 activation was caffeine-sensitive because pretreatment of A549 cells with caffeine completely blocked activation of Plk3 by H2O2 (data not shown). To determine the possibility that Plk3 was involved in mediating H2O2-induced p53 phosphorylation, we screened a dozen cell lines for Plk3 expression. We observed (Fig.4A) that Daudi (B lymphoblastic leukemic cells with wild-type p53 (40Furuwatari C. Yagi A. Yamagami O. Ishikawa M. Hidaka E. Ueno I. Furihata K. Ogiso Y. Katsuyama T. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1998; 110: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)) did not express detectable levels of Plk3, whereas other tested cell lines expressed various levels of this protein. Further analysis with polymerase chain reaction confirmed that no Plk3 expression was detectable in Daudi cells (data not shown). To determine whether the absence of Plk3 expression affected p53 phosphorylation, we analyzed p53 phosphorylation on both serine 20 and serine 15 residues in Daudi cells exposed to H2O2. Fig. 4B shows that p53 phosphorylation on serine 15 is rapidly induced and maintained for at least 2 h in Daudi cells (lanes 2–5). In contrast, no serine 20 phosphorylation was observed. Chk2 is reported to phosphorylate p53 on serine 20 (39). Reprobing the same blot with antibody to Chk2 revealed that Daudi cells expressed abundant Chk2 (Fig. 4B). These observations suggest that Plk3 is involved in regulating serine 20 phosphorylation of p53. We next asked whether Plk3 directly phosphorylated p53. In vitro kinase assays showed (Fig.5A) that recombinant histidine-tagged Plk3 (His6-Plk3) phosphorylated GST-p53 (lane 2), as well as casein (lane 1), but not GST alone (lane 5), indicating that Plk3 targets the p53 moiety of GST-p53. A kinase-defective mutant of Plk3, His6-Plk3K52R, in which lysine 52 was replaced with arginine, did not significantly phosphorylate GST-p53 (Fig.5A, lane 3). To further examine whether the serine 20 residue of p53 was a phosphorylation target of Plk3, we incubated GST-p53 with His6-Plk3 or His6-Plk3K52R in the kinase buffer supplemented with ATP.In vitro phosphorylated GST-p53 samples, as well as nonphosphorylated GST-p53, were blotted for serine 20 phosphorylation. Fig. 5B shows that purified GST-p53 was not recognized by the antibody to serine 20-phosphorylated p53 (lane 4). However, when phosphorylated in vitro by His6-Plk3, but not by His6-Plk3K52R, GST-p53 exhibited a strong phosphoserine 20 epitope (lane 5). Given that Plk3 kinase activity and serine 20 phosphorylation of p53 are induced by H2O2, these observations strongly suggest that serine 20 is an in vivo target of Plk3 during H2O2-induced stress response. To explore the physical interaction between p53 and Plk3, we immunoprecipitated Plk3 from cells treated with or without H2O2, and Plk3 immunoprecipitates were then blotted for the presence of serine 20-phosphorylated p53. Fig.5C shows that neither the control IgGs appreciably precipitated serine 20-phosphorylated p53 from the H2O2-treated cells (lane 1) nor Plk3 antibody brought down the phospho-p53 from the untreated control cells (lane 2) However, Plk3 antibody precipitated p53 that was phosphorylated on serine 20 from cells treated with H2O2. To further demonstrate that Plk3 regulated serine 20 phosphorylation of p53 in vivo, GM00637 cells were transfected with constructs expressing either Plk3 or Plk3K52R. One day after transfection, both Plk3 proteins were expressed (Fig.6A, lanes 3 and4) at a level higher than the endogenous one (the band with a slower mobility). The fast mobility of both transfected Plk3 proteins was due to a short truncation at the amino terminus. Further analysis of the transfected cells showed (Fig. 6B) that no significant enhancement in serine 20 phosphorylation was detected when cells were transfected with either Plk3 (lane 2) or Plk3K52R (lane 3) compared with cells transfected with vector alone (lane 1). However, when Plk3-transfected cells were exposed to a low concentration of H2O2, a significant increase in serine 20 phosphorylation was detected (lanes 2 and 5). In contrast, no such enhancement in serine 20 phsophorylation was detected in cells transfected with Plk3K52R (lanes 3 and6). These observations suggest that Plk3 needs to be activated by ROS before it can fully phosphorylate its physiological substrates. The mechanism by which mammalian cells transmit signals in response to oxidative damage remains unclear. Here we report that ROS phosphorylates and activates p53 tumor suppressor protein. Consequences of p53 activation are either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. We have observed that p53 activation in response to H2O2 treatment results in significant increase in expression of p21, but not of Bax (Fig. 1B), which is consistent with our observation that the concentration of H2O2 used in our experiments did not cause significant apoptosis of GM00637 cells (data not shown). However, we cannot exclude the possibility of Bax activation by post-translational mechanisms. Interestingly, it has been proposed that p53 may cause cell death by directly stimulating mitochondria to produce an excess amount of toxic ROS in some cells (33Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5822) Google Scholar). Thus, a feedback loop between p53 and ROS may exist, which is presumably to amplify the stress signal, resulting in accelerated programmed cell death when damage caused by a genotoxic stress is beyond repair. Recent advances indicate that reversible phosphorylation plays an important role in the DNA damage checkpoint activation. In fact, p53 is rapidly phosphorylated upon exposure of cells to IR or UV (6Caspari T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R315-R317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Our current studies demonstrated that oxidative stress activates p53 also through phosphorylation on multiple residues. The kinetics of ROS-induced phosphorylation of p53 on various serine residues is apparently different (Fig. 1A), suggesting the involvement of several protein kinases. It is also likely that phosphorylation of certain residues may facilitate the subsequent phosphorylation of other residues. Consistent with the latter scenario, phopshorylation of threonine 18 by casein kinase II requires prior phosphorylation of serine 15 by ATM upon DNA damage (41Dumaz N. Milne D.M. Meek D.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Our current studies indicate that Plk3 is directly involved in H2O2-induced phosphorylation of p53 on the serine 20 residue. First, induction of both p53 phosphorylation and Plk3 kinase activity by H2O2 is ATM-dependent (Figs. 2B and 3B). Second, H2O2 does not induce serine 20 phosphorylation of p53 in Daudi cells that express Chk2 but no detectable levels of Plk3 (Fig. 4). Third, Plk3, but not Plk3K52R, directly phosphorylates GST-p53 (but not GST alone) in vitro, and Plk3-phosphorylated GST-p53 contains a strong serine 20 epitope (Fig. 5). Fourth, Plk3 interacts with serine 20-phosporylated p53 when cells are exposed to H2O2 (Fig. 5C). Fifth, ectopic expression of Plk3, but not the kinase-defective mutant Plk3K52R, results in significantly enhanced phosphorylation of p53 on serine 20 after H2O2 treatment. Our studies, together with previous observations (30Ouyang B. Li W. Pan H. Meadows J. Hoffmann I. Dai W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6029-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggest that Plk3 may act in parallel with Chk1 and Chk2, downstream of ATM or ATR. Plk3 may preferentially transduce signals generated by a specific genotoxic stress such as H2O2, just as Chk1 and Chk2 are differentially activated by UV radiation and IR, respectively (6Caspari T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R315-R317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The observation that serine 20 phosphorylation of p53 was not induced by H2O2 in Daudi cells that express abundant Chk2 but no detectable Plk3 supports this notion. On the other hand, given that Cdc5 acts downstream of Rad53 in yeast (26Cheng L. Hunke L. Hardy C.F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7360-7370Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is also possible that Plk3 may lie downstream of Chk2 (and/or Chk1). Plk3 may integrate the signals from ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1 and induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis by phosphorylating either Cdc25C on serine 216 or p53 on serine 20. Consistent with the latter scenario, Plk3 is activated by IR-mimetic drug adriamycin and UV radiation (data not shown) in addition to H2O2. We are grateful to Jessica Chen for technical assistance. We also thank Intisar Husain for Plk3 and Plk3K52R expression construct."

These novel eicosanoids may have unique pharmacological properties and/or serve as latent sources of prostaglandins at sites remote from their tissue of origin. Therefore, we investigated the metabolism of PG-Gs and PG-EAs <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. PGE<sub>2</sub>-G was rapidly hydrolyzed in rat plasma to generate PGE<sub>2</sub> (<i>t</i>½ = 14 s) but was only slowly metabolized in human plasma (<i>t</i>½ > 10 min). An intermediate extent of metabolism of PGE<sub>2</sub>-G was observed in human whole blood (<i>t</i>½ ≈ 7 min). The parent arachidonylglycerol, 2-AG, and the more stable regioisomer, 1-AG, also were much more rapidly metabolized in rat plasma compared with human plasma. PGE<sub>2</sub>-EA was not significantly hydrolyzed in plasma, undergoing slow dehydration/isomerization to PGB<sub>2</sub>-EA. Both PGE<sub>2</sub>-G and PGE<sub>2</sub>-EA were stable in canine, bovine, and human cerebrospinal fluid. Human 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the initial step in PG inactivation <i>in vivo</i>, oxidized both PGE<sub>2</sub>-G and PGE<sub>2</sub>-EA less efficiently than the free acid. The sterically hindered glyceryl prostaglandin was the poorest substrate examined in the E series. Minimal 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase oxidation of PGF<sub>2α</sub>-G was observed. PGE<sub>2</sub>-G and PGE<sub>2</sub>-EA pharmacokinetics were assessed in rats. PGE<sub>2</sub>-G was not detected in plasma 5 min following an intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg. However, PGE<sub>2</sub>-EA was detectable up to 2 h following an identical dose, displaying a large apparent volume of distribution and a half-life of over 6 min. The results suggest that endocannabinoid-derived PG-like compounds may be sufficiently stable in humans to exert actions systemically. Furthermore, these results suggest that the rat is not an adequate model for investigating the biological activities of 2-arachidonylglycerol or glyceryl prostaglandins in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2044399712,"Furin, a predominant convertase of the cellular constitutive secretory pathway, is known to be involved in the maturation of a number of growth/differentiation factors, but the mechanisms governing its expression remain elusive. We have previously demonstrated that transforming growth factor (TGF) β1, through the activation of Smad transducers, regulates its own converting enzyme, furin, creating a unique activation/regulation loop of potential importance in a variety of cell fate and functions. Here we studied the involvement of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway in such regulation. Using HepG2 cells transfected withfur P1 LUC (luciferase) promoter construct, we observed that forced expression of a dominant negative mutant form of the small G protein p21ras (RasN17) inhibited TGFβ1-inducedfur gene transcription, suggesting the involvement of the p42/p44 MAPK cascade. In addition, TGFβ induced sustained activation/phosphorylation of endogenous p42/p44 MAPK. Further-more, the role of MAPK cascade in fur gene transcription was highlighted by the use of the MEK1/2 inhibitors, PD98059 or U0126, or co-expression of a p44 antisense construct that repressed the induction of fur promoter transactivation. Conversely, overexpression of a constitutively active form of MEK1 increased unstimulated, TGFβ1-stimulated, and Smad2-stimulated promoter P1 transactivation, and the universal Smad inhibitor, Smad7, inhibited this effect. Activation of Smad2 by MEK1 or TGFβ1 resulted in an enhanced nuclear localization of Smad2, which was inhibited upon blocking MEK1 activity. Our findings clearly show that the activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway is involved in fur gene expression and led us to propose a co-operative model whereby TGFβ1-induced receptor activation stimulates not only a Smad pathway but also a parallel p42/p44 MAPK pathway that targets Smad2 for an increased nuclear translocation and enhanced fur gene transactivation. Such an uncovered mechanism may be a key determinant for the regulation of furin in embryogenesis and growth-related physiopathological conditions.

This prototype of the pro-protein convertase family (for reviews, see Refs.1Seidah N.G. Day R. Marcinkiewicz M. Chrétien M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1829-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), although some proportion of the furin molecules can recycle from the cell membrane to endosomes (4Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The biological importance of this convertase stems from the large number and variety of bioactive proteins and peptides that can be generated through its activity. These include key molecules involved in normal and physiopathological conditions including growth/differentiation processes. Furin cleaves C-terminal to an unique processing site (RX(K/R)R) found in many growth/differentiation-related peptides and proteins including TGFβ,1 activin A, BMP family members, Nodal, lefty-1, and lefty-2 as well as growth factor pro-receptors such as insulin-like growth factor receptor and the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-Met) (2Nakayama K.

Robertson E.J. Development. 2000; 127: 245-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Silencing of the expression of mouse furin results in embryonic lethality because of hemodynamic insufficiency associated with several development defects including disruption of development of the heart and vascular system and failure to undergo axial rotation (7Roebroek A.J. Umans L. Pauli I.G. Robertson E.J. van Leuven F. Van de Ven W.J. Constam D.B. Development. 1998; 125: 4863-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings highlight the role of furin in growth and development and in the physiological maturation of substrates involved in these processes including members of the TGFβ family.The results from previous studies have demonstrated that pro-TGFβ1 is efficiently processed by furin releasing the genuine mature growth factor (8Dubois C.M. Laprise M.H. Blanchette F. Gentry L.E. Leduc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and that among the pro-protein convertase members, furin more closely satisfies the requirements needed for an authentic TGFβ1 converting enzyme (9Dubois C.M. Blanchette F. Laprise M.H. Leduc R. Grondin F. Seidah N.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In fibroblastic and synovial cells, the furin cleavage product, TGFβ1, up-regulated gene expression of its own converting enzyme, resulting in an increase in endogenous TGFβ1 processing activity and release of the bioactive peptide (10Blanchette F. Day R. Dong W. Laprise M.H. Dubois C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). TGFβ1 did not increase furin mRNA stability and treatment of synovial cells with actinomycin D, before TGFβ1 addition prevented the increase in fur gene expression. This observation suggested that furin concentrations could be regulated at the transcriptional level, resulting in the increase in local concentrations of bioactive growth factors. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TGFβ1 exerts its effects have not been fully elucidated.In the last few years significant progress has been made in the signaling mechanisms utilized by TGFβ1. A major discovery comes from the recent uncovering and cloning of specific Smad signaling proteins consisting of pathway-restricted Smads (Smad2 and Smad3), the common mediator Smad4, and the inhibitory Smads (Smad6 and Smad7) (for reviews see Refs. 11Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12Massagué J. Annu. Rev.

TGFβ signals through sequential activation of two cell surface serine-threonine kinase receptors, which phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3 within their conserved C-terminal SSXS motif (14Macias-Silva M.

These activated Smads, together with Smad4, translocate to the nucleus and, in association with other transcription factors, activate the transcription of target genes (16Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 17Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.H.

Among the participating transcription factors are the winged helix factor FAST (now known as FoxH1) (18Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar) in the case of Smad2 (19Chen X. Rubock M.J. Whitman M. Nature. 1996; 383: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) or AP-1 in the case of Smad3 (reviewed in Refs. 20Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin.

Naturally occurring inhibitors, Smad6 and Smad7, block and hence control TGFβ superfamily signaling by competitively interacting with the activated type I receptors (23Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar,24Hayashi H. Abdollah S. Qiu Y. Cai J. Xu Y.Y. Grinnell B.W.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar).As increasing information is collected regarding the detailed molecular mechanism of Smad protein signaling, a number of functional interactions between these proteins and other signaling pathways have been reported. For example, recent work has demonstrated that the linker region of BMP pathway-restricted Smad1 was phosphorylated by ERK2 (25Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), a member of the classic ERK-activated protein kinase pathway, leading to the inhibition of nuclear translocation of the Smad1-Smad4. In contrast, other studies have demonstrated positive functional interaction between the two stress-activated protein kinase pathways and Smads. For instance, it has been demonstrated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase-1 (MEKK-1), an upstream activator of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, enhances Smad protein transcriptional co-activator interactions in endothelial cells (26Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R. Anderson K.R. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8797-8805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Also, other groups have demonstrated that TGFβ1 activates Smad and TAK1 pathways, resulting in the formation of an active transcription complex composed of Smad3-Smad4 and the p38 nuclear target ATF-2 (27Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Masuyama N. Nishita M. Fujisawa J. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27161-27167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 28Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S. Gotoh-Mandeville R. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8949-8957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).In a recent study, we provided evidence for the central role of Smads in the transcriptional activation of the TGFβ1-induciblefur P1 promoter activity (29Blanchette F. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Cell Physiol. 2001; 188: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Using HepG2 cells transfected with LUC (luciferase) promoter constructs, we observed that among the three furin promoters, the P1 promoter was the strongest and the most sensitive to TGFβ1 and that Smads were essential for mediating such responsiveness. We also observed that the proximal P1 promoter region (positions −8734 to −7925) that contains one SBE (Smad binding element) and one ARE (activin-responsive element) binding site carries most of the Smad responsiveness. These results highlight the central role of Smads in the expression of furin, an important gear of the complex TGFβ1 maturation/activation machinery.In light of the emerging evidence for the interactions between the Smad and the MAPK pathways and the role of furin in growth and differentiation events, it was of interest to explore the possible integration between these two pathways for the regulation of this convertase. Using HepG2 cells transfected with fur P1 LUC (luciferase) promoter construct, we observed that forced expression of a dominant negative mutant of the small G protein p21ras (RasN17) inhibited TGFβ1-induced fur gene transcription. Furthermore, the role of the p42/p44 MAPK cascade infur gene transcription was emphasized by the use of the MEK1/2 inhibitors, PD98059 or U0126, or co-expression of a p44 antisense construct that blunted the induction of fur gene transcription by TGFβ1. Conversely, forced expression of a constitutively active form of MEK1 (MEKA) increased unstimulated, TGFβ1-stimulated, and Smad-stimulated promoter P1 transactivation, and the universal Smad inhibitor, Smad7, inhibited this effect. Our findings clearly show that activation of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway is involved in fur gene expression and suggest functional interactions between the Smad and the p42/p44 MAPK cascade pathway in this regulation.DISCUSSIONThe findings presented herein clearly show that TGFβ1-induced receptor activation stimulates not only a Smad pathway but also a parallel p42/p44 MAPK pathway that targets Smad2 for an increased nuclear translocation and enhanced fur gene transactivation. Even though other reports such as the one from Hayashida et al. (48Hayashida T. Poncelet A.C. Hubchak S.C. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1710-1720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) have raised the possibility of interactions between the Smad and MAPK pathways for TGFβ-stimulated collagen gene expression, few studies have indeed reported positive cross-talk between the growth/differentiation MAPK pathway and the Smad pathway for the regulation of TGFβ-related functions. For instance, work from de Caestecker et al. (46de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Gen. Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) indicated that hepatocyte growth factor and epidermal growth factor mediate Smad-dependent reporter gene activation and induce phosphorylation of Smad 2 by kinases downstream of MEK1. More recently, Watanabe et al. (49Watanabe H. de Caestecker M.P. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) have shown that in differentiated chondrocytes, rapid and sustained activation of both p42/p44 and p38 MAPK is required for high levels of aggrecan gene expression, whereas Smad 2 was also involved in the initial activation of this gene that occurs in undifferentiated cells. In contrast, Kretzschmar et al. (25Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway can negativelyregulate the BMP-Smad-1-dependent transcriptional response. Also, results from Brown et al. (26Brown J.D. DiChiara M.R. Anderson K.R. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Topper J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8797-8805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) indicated that the stress-activated SAPK/JNK pathway, but not the p42/p44 MAPK pathway, can activate Smad-2-mediated transcriptional activation in bovine endothelial cells. Although Yue and Mulder (50Yue J. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have suggested that the Ras/MAPK pathways are essential for TGFβ3 induction of TGFβ1 in lung and intestinal epithelial cells, they proposed that Smads only contribute to this biological response in an indirect manner. The exact reasons for these discrepancies remain unknown, but it is clear that multiple interactions between MAPK and Smad pathways can occur depending on the cell type and possibly the extent of MAPK activation.To determine whether the classical p42/p44 MAPK cascade is involved in TGFβ1-induced activation of the fur gene, our first initiative was to determine whether the ability of TGFβ1 to stimulatefur gene expression was a p21ras-dependent or p21ras-independent mechanism. Interestingly, constitutive and TGFβ1-induced transcription of the reporter gene was efficiently inhibited by dominant negative RasN17 expression in HepG2 cells. Partial blockage of constitutive P1 promoter activity may reflect the requirement of p42/p44 MAPK cascade or other Ras effectors such as those linked to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases for basal furtransactivation. Also, it is possible that the inhibition of basal P1 promoter activation by Ras DN is due to interference with basal activation of TGFβ signal transduction pathways. In support of this, recent experiments using TGFβ-neutralizing antibodies have demonstrated that autocrine production of TGFβ accounts for 45% of basal furin P1 promoter activation in the HepG2 cell system (29Blanchette F. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Cell Physiol. 2001; 188: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The requirement of Ras for TGFβ-induced fur transactivation extends a previous study that identified other GTPases of the Rho family as intermediates of TGFβ1-initiated signaling leading to transcriptional activation of a TGFβ reporter construct (p3TP-Lux) in the same cell line (51Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar).In addition to the fur gene, Ras has been shown to be involved in the expression of other genes/proteins regulated by TGFβ. For example, RasN17 was shown to inhibit the autoinduction of TGFβ1 in lung and intestinal epithelial cells (50Yue J. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the TGFβ-induced cell cycle-related p27Kip1 and p21 Cip1 in intestinal epithelial cells (52Yue J. Buard A. Mulder K.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and TGFβ-induced urokinase expression in transformed keratinocytes (53Yu S.J. Boudreau F. Désilets A. Houde M. Rivard N. Asselin C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this context, the participation of Ras in the cellular cascade leading to the regulation of the fur gene by TGFβ would be consistent with the view of Ras as an integrator of a wide variety of TGFβ-related growth/differentiation events.Although Ras is involved in the activation of multiple pathways, we next demonstrated that the p42/p44 MAPK pathway is also involved in TGFβ-induced fur activation. In initial experiments, we have observed that TGFβ1 stimulation of HepG2 cells results in a relatively delayed but sustained p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation. Next, we observed that a biochemical blockade of p42/p44 MAPK activation or mRNA reduction through antisense technology blocked TGFβ1-induced transcriptional activation of furin P1 promoter and activation of p42/p44 MAPKs. In contrast, MEKA increased unstimulated and TGFβ1-stimulated P1 transactivation. Taken together, these observations provide strong evidence that the Ras-MEKp42/p44 MAPK signaling plays an important role in the regulation of furgene expression. In a similar way, the absolute requirement of p42/p44 MAPKs cascade in TGFβ1-induced functions such as the attenuation of haptoglobin gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells has been reported (54Santibanez J.F. Iglesias M. Frontelo P. Martinez J. Quintanilla M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 521-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).In our study, the delayed (starting 30 min) and sustained stimulation of p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation by TGFβ is consistent with a possible indirect mechanism of activation. In fact, most studies using different cell types including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated THP-1 cells, epithelial cells, or chondrocytes have reported more rapid activation of p44 MAPK occurring within 5–10 min of TGFβ1 addition (49Watanabe H. de Caestecker M.P. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14466-14473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 55Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1241-1246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In human mesanglial cells, however, a more delayed (30 min) kinetic of activation has been observed (48Hayashida T. Poncelet A.C. Hubchak S.C. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1710-1720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although the significance of this difference in timing of activation has not been elucidated, Hayashida et al. (48Hayashida T. Poncelet A.C. Hubchak S.C. Schnaper H.W.

In our system, platelet-derived growth factor would unlikely mediate the observed early p42/p44 activation because the kinetic of platelet-derived growth factor production in cells typically occurs later (i.e. at 2–4-h time points) after TGFβ stimulation (57Soma Y. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 58Leof E.B. Proper J.A. Goustin A.S. Shipley G.D. DiCorleto P.E. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2453-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, it would appear logical to propose that autocrine regulation of growth factors by TGFβ accounts for at least some of the signal amplification observed 2–4 h after TGFβ stimulation.The mechanisms regulating fur expression are not fully understood. In previous studies, we found that TGFβ1-increasedfur gene regulation occurs at the level of gene transcription (10Blanchette F. Day R. Dong W. Laprise M.H. Dubois C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1974-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and that Smad2 possibly with winged helix transcription factor FAST (FoxH1) participate in this transactivation (29Blanchette F. Rudd P. Grondin F. Attisano L. Dubois C.M. J. Cell Physiol. 2001; 188: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that forced expression of Smad2-Smad4 or MEKA leads to the activation of the fur P1 promoter, mimicking the effect of TGFβ1. In addition, MEKA-induced transactivation was abrogated in cells co-expressing the Smad inhibitor Smad7, and similarly, Smad2-Smad4-induced transactivation was blocked using chemical MEK inhibitors. This argues that both Smad and p42/p44 MAPK pathways are essential for mediating TGFβ1-induced transactivation of furin. In this regard, several cross-talk interactions are possible between the Smad and MAPK pathways, depending on the cellular environment and the targeted biological function (21Zhang Y. Feng X.H.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). As more information is being gathered regarding direct involvement of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in Smad activation, little information is available regarding direct involvement of the p42/p44 MAPK pathway. In our study, we observed that inhibition of MEK by PD98059 blocked most of the enhanced Smad-2 nuclear localization induced by TGFβ. In contrast, activation of p42/p44 MAPKs by activated MEK1 resulted in an enhanced nuclear localization of Smad2. One explanation for this cross-talk is a direct interaction between MEK1 or p42/p44 MAPKs and Smad2. It has been recently demonstrated that growth factors, namely hepatocyte growth factor and epidermal growth factor, can also mediate both Smad-dependent 3TP-lux reporter gene activation and nuclear translocation of Smad2 (46de Caestecker M.P. Parks W.T. Frank C.J. Castagnino P. Bottaro D.P. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. Gen. Dev. 1998; 12: 1587-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This correlates with an increase of Smad2 phosphorylation that is markedly reduced in the absence of the C-terminal SSXS motif of Smad2, which is the site of TGFβ type I receptor-induced phosphorylation. It has been shown that Smad7 can bind to type I TGFβ1 receptor and inhibits its capacity to phosphorylate Smad2 (22Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Imamura T. Takase M. Nishihara A. Oeda E. Hanai J. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Nature. 1997; 389: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In our study, the ability of Smad7 to inhibit MEK1-mediated transcriptional activation suggests that phosphorylation at the SSXS motif is needed for MEKA-induced activation of Smad2. This does not rule out the possibility that other potential phosphorylation motifs for the proline-directed kinases MEK/p42/p44 MAPK found within the Smad2 linker region may also participate in Smad activation as demonstrated for Smad1 (25Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massagué J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 59Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar).It was surprising to observe an enhanced Smad2 nuclear localization by MEKA in the absence of exogenous TGFβ stimulation. One possible explanation for this is the induction of autocrine TGFβ production by activated MEK. In support of this, a recent study by Yue and Mulder (50Yue J. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30765-30773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) indicated a requirement of Ras/MAPK pathway for the induction of TGFβ1 by TGFβ. In this context, p42/p44 MAPK activation by MEKA may result in the induction of TGFβ that in turn activates the Smad pathway for an enhanced Smad2 nuclear localization and increased furin expression. Also, because nuclear translocation of the Smad3 proteins was shown to occur through direct binding to the nuclear transporter importin β (60Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it would be tempting to speculate that the increase in Smad nuclear translocation comes from direct or indirect modification by activated MEK/p42/p44 kinases of proteins involved in Smad nuclear transport. In this regard, phosphorylation of the importin 58/97 heterodimer by activated CK2 kinases was shown to increase its affinity for the ligand, leading to enhanced nuclear transport of the complex (61Hubner S. Xiao C.Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17191-17195Abstract"

The Bak-deficient T leukemic cells were resistant to apoptosis induced by UV, staurosporin, VP-16, bleomycin, or cisplatin. In contrast to wild type Jurkat cells, these Bak-deficient cells did not respond to UV or treatment with these anticancer drugs by membranous phosphatidylserine exposure, DNA breaks, activation of caspases, or release of mitochondrial cytochromec. The block in the apoptotic cascade was in the mitochondrial mechanism for cytochrome c release because purified mitochondria from Bak-deficient cells failed to release cytochrome c or apoptosis-inducing factor in response to recombinant Bax or truncated Bid. The resistance of Bak-deficient cells to VP-16 was reversed by transduction of the Bak gene into these cells. Also, the cytochrome c releasing capability of the Bak-deficient mitochondria was restored by insertion of recombinant Bak protein into purified mitochondria. Following mitochondrial localization, low dose recombinant Bak restored the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c in response to Bax; at increased doses it induced cytochrome c release itself. The function of Bak is independent of Bid and Bax because recombinant Bak induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria purified from Bax−/−, Bid−/−, or Bid−/−Bax−/− mice. Together, our findings suggest that Bak plays a key role in the apoptotic machinery of cytochrome crelease and thus in the chemoresistance of human T leukemic cells.

The death receptor-mediated pathway involves mitochondria mainly as an amplification loop, whereas cellular stress-mediated apoptosis is regulated predominantly at the level of the mitochondria (1Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). In both pathways the involvement of the mitochondria is manifested by release of cytochrome c, a resident protein in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (2Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, cytochrome c in concert with apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 and dATP activates caspase-9, leading to the subsequent activation of the effector protease, caspase-3 (2Li P.

Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). Release of cytochrome c is crucial for the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, because cells deficient in cytochrome c are resistant to UV or cytotoxic drug-mediated apoptosis (4Li K. Li Y. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Spencer E. Chen Z.J. Wang X. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In addition to cytochrome c, other components of apoptosis are sequestered in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, including apoptosis inducing factor (AIF),1 which when released from the mitochondria induces apoptotic nuclear morphology in a caspase-independent manner (5Susin S.A.

Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 family proteins can be subdivided into three distinct groups: (i) anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL with sequence homology at BH (Bcl-2 homology)1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 domains; (ii) pro-apoptotic molecules, such as Bax and Bak, with sequence homology at BH1, BH2 and BH3; and (iii) pro-apoptotic proteins that share homology only at the BH3 domain, such as Bid, Bik, Noxa, and Bim (7Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). Pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins regulate apoptosis in part by controlling cytochrome crelease from mitochondria. Expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XLprevents the redistribution of cytochrome c in response to multiple death-inducing stimuli (7Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

Although interactions between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members have been extensively studied, interactions among the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and their potential interdependence has not yet been fully addressed. Cytotoxicity of Bid was reported to correlate with its ability to interact with Bax (38Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The interaction of Bid with Bax is associated with a change in the conformation of Bax, its translocation to the mitochondria, and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (39Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). However, Bid also induces cytochromec release from Bax-deficient or Bax knockout cells (38Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C.

Indeed, insertion of tBid into mitochondria from Bax-deficient cells induced a significant up-regulation in the immunoreactivity of mitochondrial Bak to staining by an N terminus-specific anti-Bak Ab (38Desagher S.

In the current study, utilizing Bak-deficient T leukemic cells, we demonstrate the significance of Bak in the apoptotic machinery of cytochromec release and thus in the chemoresistance of these cells. Staurosporin, etoposide (VP-16), bleomycin, anti-β-actin mAb (clone AC-15), and the protonophore carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) were purchased from Sigma; cisplatin was from Bristol Laboratories (Princeton, NJ), and sulindac sulfide and indomethacin were from ICN Pharmaceutical (Costa Mesa, CA).

Anti-mouse Bak Ab was from PharMingen; anti-Bax Ab (N-20) and goat anti- AIF Ab were from Santa Cruz; anti-cytochromec oxidase (Cox) IV was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mouse Bax-ΔTM (amino acids 1–173) cDNA was ligated into a pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) GST expression vector. The resulting construct encoded a GST-BaxΔTM fusion protein with GST at its N terminus. Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) cells were transformed and cultured in LB medium. When theA600 reached 0.7–1.0, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added at a concentration of 0.1 mm to induce the expression of the fusion protein. Bacteria were harvested after a 2–3-h incubation at 37 °C and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with preswollen glutathione beads for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were spun down and washed. GST-BaxΔTM was eluted with 5 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The plasmid pGEX2TKBakΔC encoding C-terminally truncated Bak (missing the last C-terminal 21 residues) as a GST fusion protein was a generous gift from Dr. Thomas Chittenden (Apoptosis Technology Inc. Cambridge, MA). GST-BakΔC was purified after bacterial transformation as described for GST-BaxΔTM. Mouse tBid (amino acids 60–195) cDNA was cloned into a pET23dwHis vector modified from the parental pET23d(+) vector (Novagen, WI). The expressed tBid has His6 tag at its N terminus. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells were transformed and cultured at 37 °C in Terrific Broth. The induction of expression was started at an A600 of 0.8–1.0 by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside with continued incubation of the culture at 37 °C for 2–3 h. The bacterial pellets were resuspended and sonicated in a buffer containing 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. After centrifugation, the cleared supernatants were passed through a His-Bind nickel agarose affinity chromatographic column precharged with 50 mm NiSO4 (Novagen). The columns were washed with wash buffer containing 60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. His-tagged tBid was eluted with elution buffer containing 400 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, and was further purified using a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. The Jurkat T leukemic cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (complete medium). A clonal cell line isolated from wild type Jurkat cells was found to be Bak-deficient. Construction of the Ad/GT-LacZ, Ad/GT-Bak, and Ad/GV16 vectors was reported previously (43Fang B. Ji L. Bouvet M. Roth J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4972-4975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 44Pataer A. Fang B., Yu, R. Kagawa S. Hunt K.K. McDonnell T.J. Roth J.A. Swisher S.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 788-792PubMed Google Scholar). A binary adenoviral vector system was used to overcome Bak-mediated apoptosis in the packaging 293 cell line, as described previously (44Pataer A. Fang B., Yu, R. Kagawa S. Hunt K.K. McDonnell T.J. Roth J.A. Swisher S.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 788-792PubMed Google Scholar). In this binary system, the vector Ad/GT-Bak contains a Bak gene under the control of the GAL4/TATA (GT) promoter and the GAL4/GV16 fusion protein. Bak gene expression could then be induced in target cells by coadministration of the Ad/GT-Bak vector with the second adenoviral vector Ad/GV16, which produces the GAL4/GV16 fusion protein. The transduction efficiencies of the adenoviral vectors were determined by assessing the titer needed to infect the cells with Ad/GT-LacZ and Ad/GV16. Wild type and clonal Jurkat cells were treated with VP-16 (20 μm), staurosporin (0.5 μm), bleomycin (17 μm), and cisplatin (100 μm) for 4, 12, or 24 h. The cells were Dounce homogenized in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice. Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation. The samples were maintained at −80 °C until assayed. Cytosolic proteins (10–30 μg) were diluted in extraction buffer at a final volume of 200 μl containing 12 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC in a microtiter plate. Release of AMC was detected in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation value of 380 nm and emission of 440 nm following 10, 30, or 60 min of incubation at 37 °C. To generate whole cell extracts, the cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 142 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The proteins were resolved by SDS/PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (45Johnson D.E. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Wang G.Q. Amoscato A. Delach S.M. Rabinowich H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar). Following probing with a specific primary Ab and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab, the protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). To obtain subcellular fractions, including S-100 and HM, Jurkat cell suspension in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (20 mm sucrose, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) was Dounce homogenized by 15–20 strokes and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain a pellet containing nuclei and remaining intact cells. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain the HM pellet. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 g for 1 h at 4 °C to pellet the remaining membrane (P-100) containing endoplasmic reticulum and to yield the final soluble cytosolic fraction, S-100. HM and S-100 subcellular fractions were assessed for the presence of cytochrome c by Western blot analysis. The nuclei, P-100, S-100, and HM were assessed for Bak expression. To obtain purified mitochondria, the Jurkat cells were suspended in mitochondria buffer (MIB) composed of 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4, and lysed by Dounce homogenization as described previously (46Petit P.X. O'Connor J.E. Grunwald D. Brown S.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei and debris were removed by a 10-min centrifugation at 650 × g, and a pellet containing mitochondria was obtained by two successive spins at 10,000 × g for 12 min. The washed mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in MIB and layered on a Percoll gradient consisting of four layers of 10, 18, 30 and 70% Percoll in MIB. After centrifugation for 35 min at 13,500 × g, the purified mitochondria were collected at the 30/70 interface. Mitochondria were diluted in MIB containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (at least a 10-fold dilution required to remove Percoll). The mitochondrial pellet was obtained by a 30-min spin at 20,000 ×g and used immediately. Following incubation of purified mitochondria (100 μg) with recombinant tBid, Bax, or Bak, mitochondria were pelleted and incubated in 100 μl of 0.1 mNa2CO3, pH 11.5, for 20 min on ice (47Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Alternatively, mitochondria were incubated with 100 μl of digitonin (1.2 mg/ml) for 20 min on ice (48Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Supernatants and mitoplasts were separated by centrifugation and dissolved in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Purified mitochondria (100 μg of protein) were incubated with recombinant His-tBid, GST-BaxΔTM, or GST-BakΔC at various doses as indicated in 20 μl of MIB at 30 °C for 30 min. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatants or mitochondria were mixed with lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting for the presence of cytochrome c or AIF. A clonal cell line obtained from the American Type Culture Collection wild type Jurkat cell line was found to be Bak-deficient. The deficiency was determined by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates by three different anti-Bak Abs specific for distinct epitopes (Fig.1 A). To further analyze the expression of Bak, lysates of wild type or clonal Jurkat cells were fractionated to yield nuclei, P-100 (endoplasmic reticulum), S-100 (cytosol), purified mitochondria, purified mitochondria treated with alkali to remove loosely attached proteins, cellular extract without HM, or crude HM containing mitochondria. The various protein fractions were assessed for the expression of Bak by Western blot analyses. Whereas expression of Bak was detected in all mitochondria-containing fractions of wild type Jurkat cells, only minor expression of Bak was observed in a similar quantity of purified mitochondria from Bak-deficient cells (Fig. 1 B). To assess the mitochondrial localization of Bak, purified mitochondria from either wild type or Bak-deficient cells were treated with alkali to remove proteins nonspecifically attached to the mitochondria (47Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In wild type Jurkat cells, Bak is a mitochondrial integral membrane protein because it was detected in the pellet of alkali-treated mitochondria (Fig.1 C). Because pretreatment of mitochondria with tBid has been reported to enhance Bax localization to the mitochondria (39Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), we assessed the effects of His-tBid on mitochondrial expression of Bak. However, treatment of mitochondria with His-tBid did not effect Bak localization. In contrast to wild type Jurkat cells, minor or no expression of Bak was detected in mitochondria of Bak-deficient cells, although they express Cox IV or VDAC at levels equal to those of wild type cells (Fig. 1 C). To further analyze the mitochondrial localization of Bak, wild type or Bak-deficient mitochondria were treated with digitonin (48Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Mild digitonin treatment partially lyses the outer membrane but not the inner mitochondrial membrane. In wild type Jurkat cells treated with a low concentration of digitonin, Bak was associated with the pellet of digitonin-treated mitochondria, whereas VDAC, an outer membrane protein, was partially removed from the mitochondria into the digitonin-sensitive fraction (Fig.1 D). Partial removal of both Bak and VDAC into the digitonin-sensitive fraction was observed in wild type mitochondria treated with increased digitonin concentrations (data not shown). These findings suggest that in wild type Jurkat cells Bak is a mitochondrial integral membrane protein that is less sensitive than VDAC to removal by mild digitonin treatment. However, the expression of Bak is deficient in the clonal Jurkat cell line. Because the Bcl-2 proapoptotic family member Bak resides in the mitochondria, we examined the susceptibility of the Bak-deficient cells to apoptotic agents known to initiate mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. Wild type and Bak-deficient cells were"

In an attempt to understand the molecular basis underlying the distinct roles of those two homologous molecules, we investigated the association of Ang-1 and Ang-2 with the extracellular matrix (ECM). TA3 murine mammary carcinoma (TA3) and Lewis lung carcinoma cells expressing v5 epitope-tagged Ang-1 and Ang-2 were used in our studies. The results indicated that Ang-1 is secreted and incorporated into the ECM of the tumor cells, whereas Ang-2 is not associated with the ECM. The mutagenesis study indicated the domain that is responsible for the ECM association of Ang-1 is the linker peptide region between the coiled-coil and the fibrinogen-like domains. A weak binding between the coiled-coil domain of Ang-1 and the ECM was observed. Immunocytochemistry study revealed a distinct ECM distribution pattern of Ang-1, which is quite different from that of fibronectin, laminin, and collagen types I and IV. The ECM-associated Ang-1 proteins are released, and Tie-2 receptors are phosphorylated upon the adhesion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Implications of the difference in the ECM association of Ang-1 and Ang-2, which are related to the regulation of angiopoietin activity and their roles in local versus distant angiogenesis during tumor metastasis, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1988736620,"Adhesion and migration of tumor cells on and through the vascular endothelium are critical steps of the metastatic invasion. We investigated the roles of E-selectin and of stress-activated protein kinase-2 (SAPK2/p38) in modulating endothelial adhesion and transendothelial migration of HT-29 colon carcinoma cells. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) strongly increased the expression of E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). This effect was independent of the activation of SAPK2/p38 induced by TNFα. Adhesion of HT-29 cells on a monolayer of HUVEC pretreated with TNFα was dependent on E-selectin expression but was independent of SAPK2/p38 activity of both HUVEC and tumor cells. The adhesion of HT-29 cells to E-selectin-expressing HUVEC led to the activation of SAPK2/p38 in the tumor cells as reflected by the increased phosphorylation of the actin-polymerizing factor HSP27 by mitogen-activated protein kinase 2/3, a direct target of SAPK2/p38. Moreover, a recombinant E-selectin/Fc chimera quickly increased the activation of SAPK2/p38 in HT-29 cells. Blocking the increased activity of SAPK2/p38 of HT-29 cells by SB203580 or by expressing a dominant negative form of SAPK2/p38 inhibited their transendothelial migration. Similarly, HeLa cells stably expressing a kinase-inactive mutant of SAPK2/p38 showed a decreased capacity to cross a layer of HUVEC. Overall, our results suggest that the regulation of transendothelial migration of tumor cells involves two essential steps as follows: adhesion to the endothelium through adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin, and increased motogenic potential through adhesion-mediated activation of the SAPK2/p38 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1994434379,"Prostaglandin E2(PGE2) is thought to be an ultimate prostaglandin effector during the ovulatory process, and the objectives of this study were to clone bovine PGE synthase (PGES) and to characterize its regulation by gonadotropins in preovulatory follicles in vivo. The bovine PGES complementary DNA (cDNA) was shown to contain a 5′-untranslated region of eight base pairs (bp), an open reading frame of 462 bp and a 3′-untranslated region of 406 bp. The putative bovine PGES open reading frame encodes a 153-amino acid protein that is 85, 78, and 78% identical to the human, rat, and mouse PGES homologs, respectively. The regulation of PGES during ovulation was studied using three different models in vivo: 1) human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-induced ovulation during a normal estrous cycle; 2) hCG-induced ovulation following ovarian hyperstimulation; and 3) spontaneous ovulation during natural estrus. Results from semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction/Southern blotting analyses showed that the hCG/luteinizing hormone surge caused a significant increase in PGES mRNA. Levels of PGES transcripts were low or undetectable prior to hCG/luteinizing hormone but increased markedly 18–24 h after hCG in models 1 and 2, and 18–24 h after the onset of natural estrus in model 3 (p < 0.05). Analyses on isolated preparations of granulosa and theca interna cells indicated that the granulosa cell layer was the predominant site of follicular PGES expression. The regulation of the protein was studied in the same models using a specific antibody raised against a fragment of bovine protein (ΔPGES; from Glu49 to Val146). Results from immunoblots showed an induction of bovine PGES (Mr = 17,000) 18–24 h after hCG treatment or onset of estrus (p < 0.05). The protein was detected in extracts of granulosa cells but not in theca interna. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the ovulatory process is associated with a gonadotropin-dependent induction of PGES in granulosa cells of ovarian follicles in vivo, thus establishing for the first time the regulation of the enzyme in a physiological context.

Interestingly, the time course of PGHS-2 induction after exogenous human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment was shown to vary greatly among species, being very rapid in rats (2–4 h post-hCG; Ref. 32Sirois J. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11586-11592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and relatively delayed in cattle (18 h post-hCG; Ref. 12Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and horses (30 h post-hCG; Refs. 13Sirois J. Doré M.

This difference in timing of PGHS-2 induction appeared directly related to the species-specific length of the ovulatory process, thereby involving PGHS-2 as a potential regulator of the mammalian ovulatory clock (37Boerboom D. Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 38Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4047-4048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studiesin vitro have established that although the gonadotropin-dependent induction of PGHS-2 in granulosa cells works primarily through the cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway, other kinases such as protein kinase C and tyrosine kinases could be involved (33Morris J.K. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Ultimately, the obligatory role of PGHS-2 expression during the ovulatory process was underscored in PGHS-2 deficient mice that were infertile and exhibited ovulation failure (39Dinchuk J.E. Car B.D.

However, though the increase in PG synthesis prior to ovulation clearly involves PGHS-2 induction, the potential regulation of the terminal enzyme involved in the conversion of PGH2into PGE2, i.e. PGE synthase (PGES), has not been addressed. The cloning and characterization of the first PGES was recently reported from human cells (41Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7220-7225Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar) and shown to correspond to a protein previously identified as microsomal glutathioneS-transferase 1 like-1 (MGST1-L1, Ref. 41Jakobsson P.J.

Shiraki T. Suzuki K. Yasuda S. Sugiura H. Cao C. Watanabe Y. Kobayashi S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2669-2677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGES is a member of the MAPEG (membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoids and glutathione metabolism) superfamily, which also includes microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 (MGST1), MGST2, MGST3, 5-lipoxygenase activating protein, and leukotriene C4 synthase (46Jakobsson P.J. Morgenstern R. Mancini J. Ford-Hutchinson A. Persson B. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The enzyme is a 16-kDa membrane-bound protein encoded by a transcript of about 2.0 kb and a gene spanning 14.8 kbp and composed of three exons (41Jakobsson P.J. Thoren S. Morgenstern R. Samuelsson B.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the enzyme was shown to be induced in vitroby various proinflammatory stimuli already known to induce PGHS-2 expression including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin (IL)-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (41Jakobsson P.J.

The induction of PGES has also been reported recently in two inflammatory modelsin vivo, including LPS-induced pyresis and adjuvant-induced arthritis (43Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N.

However, the regulation of PGES has not been described under physiological conditions. The dramatic and obligatory increase in PGE2 synthesis during the ovulatory process raises the possibility that PGES could act as a gonadotropin-regulated gene in the ovary and be involved in the regulation of this key physiological process. Therefore, the general objective of the present study was to characterize the expression of PGES in ovarian follicles during ovulation. The specific objectives were to clone and determine the primary structure of bovine PGES and to study the regulation of PGES mRNA and protein by gonadotropins in bovine follicles in specific models of ovulation in vivo. The QuikHyb hybridization solution and the ExAssist/SOLR system were purchased from Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA). [α-32P]dCTP was obtained from Mandel Scientific-New England Nuclear Life Science Products (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Prime-a-Gene labeling system, Access RT-PCR kit, pGEM-T easy Vector System I were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). TRIzol total RNA isolation reagent, 1-kbp DNA ladder, and synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Biotrans nylon membranes (0.2 μm) were purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Montréal, Québec, Canada), and Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, Rainbow molecular weight markers, ECL plus, horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody, PGEX-2T vector, BL-21 protease-deficientEscherichia coli strain, and glutathione-Sepharose beads were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Folltropin-V (follicle-stimulating hormone) was purchased from Vetrepharm Canada Inc. (Ontario, Canada), and APL (hCG) was obtained from Ayerst laboratories (Montréal, Québec, Canada). Bio-Rad Protein Assay and all electrophoretic reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. To clone the bovine PGES cDNA, a bovine cDNA library prepared with mRNA isolated from a preovulatory follicle obtained 24 h post-hCG (50Liu J. Antaya M. Goff A.K. Boerboom D. Silversides D.W. Lussier J.G. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 983-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was screened with a human PGES cDNA (42Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). The probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega) to a final specific activity greater than 1 × 108 cpm/μg DNA. Approximately 250,000 phage plaques were screened, and hybridization was performed at 55 °C with QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene). Four positive clones were plaque-purified through secondary and tertiary screenings, and pBluescript phagemids containing the cloned DNA insert were excisedin vivo with the Ex-Assist/SOLR system (Stratagene). DNA sequencing was performed commercially (Université Laval, Québec, Canada). To obtain the missing 5′-end of bovine PGES, a three-step nested PCR approach was designed. Three sense primers specific for sequences located near the multiple cloning site of the pBluescript vector (S1 = 5′-ACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCTTGATTACG-3′, S2 = 5′-CTCGAAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGG-3′, S3 = 5′-CCTGCAGGTCGACACTAGTGGATCC-3′) and three antisense primers derived from the bovine PGES cDNA clone (AS1 = 5′-TACATCCCTGGATTCAGAAGGTCG-3′, AS2 = 5′-TATCAATCGTGACGGTCCGTCTC-3′, AS3 = 5′-ATGCCACGGTGTGTACCATACGG-3′) were synthesized commercially (Life Technologies). For the first PCR reaction, a sample (5 μl) of the bovine cDNA library was denatured for 15 min at 94 °C, and amplification was performed with 1 μl of 20 μm of external sense (S1) and antisense (AS1) primers, 1 μl of 25 mm of dNTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.5 μl of Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase and 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. The reaction was run in an Omnigene TR3 SM5 thermal cycler (Hybaid Limited, Franklin, MA) for 20 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 62 °C for 45 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. The second PCR reaction was performed using 2 μl from the first PCR reaction, middle sense (S2) and antisense (AS2) primers, and 30 cycles of PCR conditions described above. The final nested PCR reaction was performed using 2 μl from the second PCR reaction, internal sense (S3) and antisense (AS3) primers, and 40 cycles of PCR conditions described above. After electrophoresis on a 1% 0.04 m Tris-acetate, 0.001m EDTA-agarose gel, the DNA fragment was excised and ligated into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA sequencing was performed commercially, and the missing 5′-end of the bovine PGES open reading frame was revealed. A 850-bp fragment of the bovine GAPDH cDNA was generated by RT-PCR using a sense (5′-TGTTCCAGTATGATTCCACCC-3′) and an antisense primer (5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′) (36Tsai S.J. Wiltbank M.C. Bodensteiner K.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3348-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and the Access RT-PCR System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR product was isolated after electrophoresis, subcloned into pGEM-T easy Vector, and sequenced to confirm its identity. The regulation of PGES expression during the ovulatory process in vivo was studied in three distinct models previously characterized by us (12Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 35Liu J. Carrière P. Doré M. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 51Liu J. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For all models, Holstein heifers 2–3 year old that exhibited normal estrous cycles were used, and follicular development was monitored by real-time ultrasonography (12Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, in the first model (hCG-induced ovulation during a normal cycle), bovine preovulatory follicles were obtained after induction of luteolysis on day 7 of the estrous cycle (12Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). An ovulatory dose of hCG (3000 IU, intravenously) was administered after induction of luteolysis, and the ovary bearing the preovulatory follicle was isolated by ovariectomy (via colpotomy) at various time points after hCG (0–26 h post-hCG) (12Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The interval of time from hCG administration to ovulation is 26–28 h post-hCG in this model. In the second model (hCG-induced ovulation following ovarian hyperstimulation), the development of multiple preovulatory follicles was stimulated by the administration of a standard 4-day protocol of exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone (Folltropin-V, Vetrepharm Canada Inc.) (51Liu J. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After induction of luteolysis, hCG (2500 IU) was administered to induce ovulation, and ovariectomies were performed at 0, 18, and 24 h after hCG treatment (51Liu J. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this model, multiple ovulations are expected 28–30 h post-hCG (51Liu J. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the third model (spontaneous ovulation during natural estrus), corpus luteum regression was induced on day 7 of the cycle, and animals were allowed to come into estrus (35Liu J. Carrière P. Doré M. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The preovulatory follicle was obtained by ovariectomy at specific times after the onset of estrus (0, 18, and 24 h after onset of estrus). In this model, the onset of estrus coincides with the endogenous LH surge, and the interval from the LH surge to ovulation is ∼30 h (35Liu J. Carrière P. Doré M. Sirois J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1524-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For all three models, the preovulatory follicles were dissected from the ovary with a scalpel, and pieces of follicle wall (i.e. theca interna with attached granulosa cells) were prepared as previously described (12Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In selected cases, some pieces of follicle wall were further dissected into isolated preparations of granulosa cells and theca interna (12Sirois J. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). All tissue samples were stored at −70 °C. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Université de Montréal. Total RNA was extracted from bovine preovulatory follicles and various tissues using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a Kinematica PT 1200C Polytron Homogenizer. All non-ovarian follicular tissues were obtained from a slaughterhouse. The Access RT-PCR System (Promega) was used for semi-quantitative analysis of PGES and GAPDH mRNA levels. Reactions were performed as directed by the manufacturer using sense (5′-TGATGAACGGCCAGGTGCTC-3′) and antisense (5′-ATGCCACGGTGTGTACCATACGG-3′) primers specific for bovine PGES, and sense (5′-TGTTCCAGTATGATTCCACCC-3′) and antisense (5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′) primers specific for bovine GAPDH (36Tsai S.J. Wiltbank M.C. Bodensteiner K.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3348-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These reactions resulted in the generation of PGES and GAPDH DNA fragments of 330 and 850 bp, respectively. Each reaction was performed using 100 ng of total RNA, and cycling conditions were one cycle of 48 °C for 45 min and 94 °C for 2 min, followed by a variable number of cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 2 min. The number of cycles used was optimized for each gene to fall within the linear range of PCR amplification and were 22 and 13 cycles for PGES and GAPDH, respectively. Following PCR amplification, samples were electrophoresed on 2% 0.04 mTris-acetate, 0.001 m EDTA-agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with corresponding radiolabeled PGES and GAPDH cDNA fragments using QuikHyb hybridization solution (Stratagene). Membranes were exposed to a phosphor screen, and signals were quantified on a Storm imaging system using the ImageQuant software version 1.1 (Molecular Dynamics). A pair of sense (5′-GATGGATCCGAGGACGCTCAGAGACATGGA-3′) and antisense (5′-TCAGAATTCGACAATCTGCAGGGCCATGGA-3′) primers that incorporated aBamHI and an EcoRI restriction site, respectively, were designed from the bovine PGES open reading frame to generate a fragment (ΔPGES) spanning the region from Glu49 to Val146. The fragment was amplified by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and following the manufacturer's protocol. The fragment was isolated after electrophoresis, digested with BamHI and an EcoRI, subcloned into pGEX-2T in frame with the GST coding region (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and sequenced to confirm its integrity. Protease-deficient E. coli BL-21 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were transformed with the ΔPGES/pGEX-2T construct, expression of recombinant ΔPGES/GST fusion protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and bacterial protein extracts were obtained after sonication and centrifugation (52Brûlé S. Rabahi F. Faure R. Beckers J.F. Silversides D.W. Lussier J.G. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).

We examined the influence of the molecular chaperone, α-crystallin, on amyloid formation by apoC-II. Time-dependent changes in apoC-II turbidity (at 0.3 mg/ml) were suppressed potently by substoichiometric subunit concentrations of α-crystallin (1–10 μg/ml). α-Crystallin also inhibits time-dependent changes in the CD spectra, thioflavin T binding, and sedimentation coefficient of apoC-II. This contrasts with stoichiometric concentrations of α-crystallin required to suppress the amorphous aggregation of stressed proteins such as reduced α-lactalbumin. Two pieces of evidence suggest that α-crystallin directly interacts with amyloidogenic intermediates. First, sedimentation equilibrium and velocity experiments exclude high affinity interactions between α-crystallin and unstructured monomeric apoC-II. Second, the addition of α-crystallin does not lead to the accumulation of intermediate sized apoC-II species between monomer and large aggregates as indicated by gel filtration and sedimentation velocity experiments, suggesting that α-crystallin does not inhibit the relatively rapid fibril elongation upon nucleation. We propose that α-crystallin interacts stoichiometrically with partly structured amyloidogenic precursors, inhibiting amyloid formation at nucleation rather than the elongation phase. In doing so, α-crystallin forms transient complexes with apoC-II, in contrast to its chaperone behavior with stressed proteins.

Holdsworth G. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 288-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One function of apoC-II is to activate lipoprotein lipase as an essential part of lipoprotein remodeling (2Havel R.J. Fielding C.J. Olivecrona T. Shore V.G. Fielding P.E. Egelrud T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 1828-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The structure of apoC-II in the presence of the lipid mimetic, SDS, reveals three regions of well defined amphipathic α-helix with loosely defined intervening regions that may reflect flexible hinge regions (3MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Howlett G.J. Gooley P.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 90: 5414-5421Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Such amphipathic α-helical regions are characteristic of the exchangeable apolipoprotein family and are crucial for the reversible exchange of apolipoproteins between lipoprotein classes (4Segrest J.P. Garber D.W. Brouillette C.G. Harvey S.C. Anantharamaiah G.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 303-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a lipid-free environment, apoC-II slowly aggregates into fibers with all the hallmarks of amyloid including the binding to thioflavin T, the binding to Congo Red with red/green birefringence under cross-polarized light, and increased β-structure as measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy (5Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The amyloid fibrils formed by apoC-II have a helical twisted ribbon morphology under physiological conditions of pH, salt concentrations, and temperature with no indication of amorphous aggregates (5Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In vitro amyloid formation by apoC-II can be compared with the in vivo deposition of amyloid involving other apolipoproteins such as apoA-I (6Westermark P. Mucchiano G. Marthin T. Johnson K.H.

Immunol. 1985; 21: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A significant clue to the prevalence of apolipoproteins in amyloid formation is provided by the observation that many apolipoproteins have limited conformational stability or secondary structure in the absence of lipid (5Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Destabilized conformations in many proteins promote amyloid formation (13Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C.

Apolipoprotein derivatives that form amyloid are frequently mutant isoforms or truncated products, for example, amyloid deposition involving apoA-I (6Westermark P. Mucchiano G. Marthin T.

Howlett G.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones interact with partly folded intermediate states of proteins to prevent illicit interactions such as incorrect folding and aggregation. α-Crystallin is 20-kDa member of the small heat-shock protein family that interacts in a chaperone manner with partly folded proteins and prevents their irreversible aggregation and precipitation (16Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 10: 52-59Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 17Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In the lens, α-crystallin is present as oligomeric complexes comprising 30 or more of two related subunits, A and B. Outside the lens, only αB-crystallin is induced in response to stress (16Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 10: 52-59Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 17Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Elevated expression of αB-crystallin is observed in Alzheimer's disease and other neurological diseases that are characterized by protein precipitation/amyloid formation, such as Parkinson's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases (16Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 10: 52-59Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 17Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin.

In this paper, we show that sub-stoichiometric levels of α-crystallin inhibit amyloid nucleation by apoC-II, suggesting a more general role for α-crystallin in preventing amyloid formationin vivo. ApoC-II was expressed (20Wang C.S. Downs D. Dashti A. Jackson K.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (5Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The washed inclusion bodies were dissolved in 50 ml of 5 mguanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), 100 mm arginine, pH 12.0, and applied in one loading to a 5 × 100-cm column packed in Sephadex G-75 pre-equilibrated with 6 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with 6 m urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The apoC-II eluted from anion exchange chromatography (5Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) ran as a single band using Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). ApoC-II was stored as stock at a concentration of 30 mg/ml in 5m GdnHCl. ApoC-II was refolded into refolding buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1% sodium azide, pH 7.4) by rapid dilution from the stock solution. Experiments were performed using refolding buffer and a temperature of 20 °C unless otherwise indicated. The concentration of apoC-II was determined using the extinction coefficient, ε280 nm = 1.45 g·cm−2. Lenses were extracted from calf eyes obtained from the local abattoirs and stored at −20 °C. α-Crystallin was purified from bovine lenses as described previously (22Slingsby C. Bateman O.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 51: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Lindner R.A. Treweek T.M. Carver J.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the purity of α-crystallin. Prior to each experiment, a fresh stock of α-crystallin was prepared by dissolving lyophilized protein into refolding buffer at a concentration of 1–2 mg/ml. The concentration of α-crystallin was determined using the extinction coefficient, ε280 nm = 0.9 g·cm−2. The kinetics of aggregation of apoC-II was monitored by absorbance (turbidity) at a wavelength of 400 nm using a Cary-5 spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia). Sample volumes of 2 ml were placed into acryl cuvettes, and the samples were sealed with sealing film. Measurements were made at 4-min intervals. Molecular masses of 8,915 Da for apoC-II and 19,905 Da for α-crystallin were used for calculating molar ratios. Samples of apoC-II at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml were analyzed using an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) in an AnTi60 rotor. For equilibrium experiments, sample volumes (80 μl) were subjected to 18 h of centrifugation at the rotor speed of 20,000 rpm. Sedimentation equilibrium distributions were fitted to a model describing a single sedimenting species using the program SEDEQ1B kindly provided by Dr. Allen Minton, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda. The molecular masses were floated in the fitting procedure, and the base-line absorbance was set to zero for apoC-II alone. The non-sedimenting base line for α-crystallin (0.045) was determined from separate high speed (40,000 rpm) sedimentation experiments. This value was fixed as the base-line absorbance during the fitting of apoC-II in the presence of α-crystallin. For sedimentation velocity experiments, a sample volume of 400 μl was used, and radial scans were recorded at 10-min intervals at rotor speeds of 30,000 or 40,000 rpm. For the analysis of the fast moving species in the samples containing aggregated apoC-II, the sedimentation coefficient was estimated from the slope of a plot of ln(r)versus ω2·t, where ris the radial position of the boundary in cm, ω is the angular velocity in rad·s−1, and t is time in seconds. For the analysis of the slower moving boundaries of apoC-II, data were fitted to a model assuming a single sedimenting species using the software SEDFIT kindly provided by Dr. Peter Schuck, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda (24Schuck P. MacPhee C.E. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 466-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For the fitting of data to a continuous size distribution model (25Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar), a regularization parameter ofp = 0.68 and resolution of 80 sedimentation coefficient increments were used with the fitting performed in SEDFIT. The base-line absorbance was set to 0, and the meniscus position was fixed during the fitting with the sedimentation coefficient range set from 0.1 to 50 S. The optimal value for the frictional ratio (f/f0) for α-crystallin was found through iteration using the sedimentation data of α-crystallin alone. This frictional ratio was fixed for the analysis of the data for α-crystallin in the presence of apoC-II. A partial specific volume of 0.73 ml/g was calculated from the amino acid compositions of apoC-II and α-crystallin using the program SEDNTERP (26Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar), and a buffer density of 1.01 g/ml was used in the calculations. Four-day incubated samples of apoC-II were dialyzed overnight against refolding buffer without sodium azide which hinders circular dichroism measurements at near UV wavelengths. Other samples were prepared in refolding buffer without sodium azide. The spectra of samples (0.1–0.3 mg/ml) were recorded in a model 62DS circular dichroism spectrometer (Aviv Instruments, Lakewood, NJ) from 200 to 250 nm using 0.05–0.1-mm path length cuvettes. Spectra were recorded at 0.5-nm intervals with 6-s integration times and a bandwidth of 1.5 nm. Data were corrected for buffer contributions and smoothed using the software provided by the manufacturer. The mean residue ellipticity, [θ], was calculated from the equation [θ] = Mθ/cnl, where θ is the measured ellipticity; c is the concentration of protein (mg/ml); n is the number of amino acid residues;l is the path length (in cm); and M is the molecular mass. Samples containing 0–7 μg of apoC-II or α-crystallin were mixed with thioflavin T in a microtiter plate to final concentrations of 5 μm thioflavin T and 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, in 200 μl. The samples were incubated for 5 min before measuring the fluorescence intensity using an fmax fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with an excitation filter of 444 nm (half bandwidth 12 ± 2 nm) and emission filter of 485 nm (half bandwidth of 14 ± 2 nm). Sample volumes of 1 ml were loaded onto a 1 × 30-cm column packed with Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated in refolding buffer. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and the absorbance of the eluent was monitored at a wavelength of 280 nm. ApoC-II at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml and pH 7.4 shows a gradual rise in turbidity to an absorbance of ∼0.016 after 115 h at 20 °C (Fig. 1). In the presence of α-crystallin at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml (data not shown) and 10 μg/ml (Fig. 1), apoC-II aggregation is suppressed as indicated by the negligible rise in turbidity over the time course. The presence of 1 μg/ml α-crystallin also significantly reduces the rate of amyloid formation (Fig. 1). α-Crystallin alone at concentrations of 10 μg/ml and 0.1 mg/ml showed no change in turbidity (data not shown). The sigmoidal shapes of the turbidity data are similar to that observed for other amyloid systems that involve nucleation, where unstable pre-fibrillar intermediates precede the formation of stable amyloid fibrils (27Ferrone F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 256-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the concentrations of α-crystallin required to suppress amyloid formation by apoC-II at 0.3 mg/ml are significantly sub-stoichiometric. For example, α-crystallin concentrations of 1 and 10 μg/ml are equivalent to a 670 and 67 molar excess of apoC-II monomer relative to the molar concentration of α-crystallin subunits, respectively. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed to examine the molecular mass of apoC-II in the presence and absence of α-crystallin. Fig. 2 shows the sedimentation equilibrium profile of freshly prepared apoC-II (0.3 mg/ml) in the presence and absence of α-crystallin (0.9 mg/ml). Under the conditions used, α-crystallin sediments to the bottom of the cell leaving apoC-II in the supernatant. The sedimentation data gave best fit molecular masses of 10,000 and 11,500 Da for apoC-II in the absence and presence of α-crystallin, respectively, suggesting that the soluble material remaining in solution is largely monomeric apoC-II (Fig. 2). The equilibrium profile of apoC-II in the presence of α-crystallin at 18 h shows higher radial absorbances through the column volume suggesting less apoC-II aggregation in the cell, consistent with the properties of α-crystallin in inhibiting amyloid formation (Fig. 1). The data in Fig. 2 exclude a high affinity interaction between monomeric apoC-II and α-crystallin. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to investigate the effect of α-crystallin on the time-dependent changes in the secondary structure of apoC-II. Freshly prepared apoC-II gave a spectrum characteristic of an unordered protein conformation (Fig.3, solid line) and is similar to the spectra previously reported for monomeric apoC-II (5Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Tajima S. Yokoyama S. Kawai Y. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 1273-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, the spectrum for apoC-II incubated for 5 days in the absence of α-crystallin showed more negative molar ellipticities between 200 and 250 nm (Fig. 3, dashed dotted line). The broad peak, reaching a maximum negative molar ellipticity between 208 and 212 nm, suggests the presence of substantial secondary structure, consistent with the formation of amyloid. The CD spectrum for α-crystallin (at 0.1 mg/ml) showed a shallow negative peak centered at 215–220 nm rising to a positive molar ellipticity below ∼203 nm (Fig. 3, dotted line). This spectrum is consistent with that of classical β-sheet and is similar to previous reports for α-crystallin (29Sun T.X. Das B.K. Liang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6220-6225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The spectrum of apoC-II (0.3 mg/ml) incubated for 5 days in the presence of 10 μg/ml α-crystallin gave an intermediate spectrum between that of freshly prepared apoC-II and that of aggregated apoC-II (Fig. 3, dashed line). The spectral component of 10 μg/ml α-crystallin is negligible under these conditions. Based on the change in the molar ellipticity at 215 nm, 10 μg/ml α-crystallin inhibited the change in secondary structure of 0.3 mg/ml apoC-II after 5 days of incubation by 80–85%. We used fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize the binding of apoC-II to thioflavin T. Thioflavin T binds to cross-β-sheet structures within amyloid, producing a characteristic change in its fluorescence properties. The addition of freshly prepared apoC-II to thioflavin T (5 μm) resulted in negligible increases in the fluorescence emission intensity of thioflavin T (Fig.4). In contrast, addition of 5-day-old apoC-II to thioflavin T causes a linear increase in the fluorescence as a function of added apoC-II. This result indicates strong binding to thioflavin T. The addition of apoC-II incubated for 5 days in the presence of 10 μg/ml α-crystallin resulted in intermediate rises in the fluorescence intensity of thioflavin T. Under the conditions used, the contribution of α-crystallin alone to the changes in fluorescence intensity was negligible. The slopes of the lines in Fig. 4 indicate that there is ∼75% less thioflavin T-reactive material in the sample of apoC-II incubated for 5 days in the presence of 10 μg/ml α-crystallin compared with apoC-II incubated in the absence of α-crystallin. These results can be compared with the time-dependent changes in the turbidity (Fig. 1) and CD spectra (Fig. 3), which together suggest significant suppression of amyloid formation. We used sedimentation velocity analysis to investigate the aggregation state of 0.3 mg/ml apoC-II incubated for 5 days with 10 μg/ml α-crystallin. Freshly prepared apoC-II (Fig.5 A) sedimented as a single species of molecular mass 9,200 Da and sedimentation coefficient of 0.94 S (fits not shown). Sedimentation analysis of the apoC-II incubated for 5 days in the presence of 10 μg/ml α-crystallin revealed the presence of a broad, fast moving boundary (average sedimentation coefficient of ∼50 S; Fig. 5 B) that composed ∼20% of the optical density. Because of the low relative concentration of α-crystallin, the contribution of α-crystallin to the optical density was negligible. After centrifugation of the fast moving population to the bottom of the cell, the remaining slower moving species gave excellent fits to a single molecular mass species (8,500 Da; s = 0.89 S; fits not shown). This result can be compared with the sedimentation velocity behavior of freshly prepared apoC-II (0.3 mg/ml) after incubation for 7 h where a comparable amount of aggregate has formed (Fig. 5 C). The fast moving population (average sedimentation coefficient of 40 S) is clearly resolved from the slower moving boundary as observed with apoC-II incubated for 5 days in the presence 10 μg/ml α-crystallin (Fig.5 B). An aggregate content of ∼20% in the sample containing apoC-II incubated in the presence of α-crystallin (10 μg/ml) suggests that the changes observed in the CD spectra and the thioflavin T binding assay are due to fast-sedimenting amyloid fibrils rather than the formation of a partly structured monomeric apoC-II or small oligomers. The bimodal population of monomer and large aggregates observed in Fig. 5, B and C, demonstrates that amyloid formation is highly cooperative in the presence and absence of α-crystallin with little or no accumulation of intermediate sized apoC-II aggregates. The cooperativity of amyloid formation was further investigated by Sepharose CL-6B gel filtration chromatography. This resin has a nominal fractionation mass range between 10,000 and 4,000,000 Da for globular proteins allowing a clear distinction between monomers, intermediate oligomers, and aggregates. Fig.6 A shows the elution profile of apoC-II (1 mg/ml) incubated for 2 h (dashed line). The first and sharper peak elutes at 8 ml, which is close to the expected void volume, and the second slightly broader and smaller peak elutes at 19.3 ml. This elution behavior is consistent with a bimodal population of monomers and large aggregates in excess of 1–5 MDa. The elution profile of a sample incubated for 20 h shows a 2-fold larger peak near the void volume and a 20-fold smaller, almost negligible peak at 20 ml suggesting that most of the monomers have aggregated (Fig. 6 A, solid line). These elution patterns are consistent with aggregation of apoC-II as indicated by turbidity data (Fig. 1) and sedimentation velocity data (Fig. 5). ApoC-II (1 mg/ml) incubated for 2 h in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml α-crystallin also gave two peaks (Fig. 6 B, dashed line). The peak near the void volume is smaller than that observed for apoC-II alone, whereas the peak near the void volume is larger than that observed for apoC-II alone, suggesting reduced conversion of monomers to aggregates in the presence of α-crystallin. The absence of significant species of intermediate mass is consistent with the sedimentation velocity experiments (Fig. 5 B) suggesting that the rate of polymer extension of apoC-II amyloid is relatively fast and unimpeded by the presence of α-crystallin. After 20 h, the peak near the total volume is 2.5-fold larger that the peak observed for apoC-II alone, whereas the peak near the total volume is decreased by 50% consistent with a reduced aggregation in the presence of α-crystallin (Fig.6 B, solid line). Sedimentation velocity experiments were used to determine whether apoC-II affected the sedimentation behavior of α-crystallin. Freshly prepared apoC-II (0.3 mg/ml) sediments slowly (Fig.7 A), consistent with the presence of monomeric species (5Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas α-crystallin (0.9 mg/ml) sediments rapidly to the bottom of the cell (Fig.7 B). This large difference in the rate of sedimentation of apoC-II and α-crystallin provides a means to monitor the effect of apoC-II on the sedimentation behavior of α-crystallin. The results in Fig. 7 C for a mixture of apoC-II (0.3 mg/ml) and α-crystallin (1.2 mg/ml) show an apparent superimposition of absorbance contributions from fast sedimenting α-crystallin on that of slow moving monomeric apoC-II. Continuous size distribution analysis (25Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar) of the sedimentation data for α-crystallin (Fig. 7 B) resulted in excellent fits (gray lines in Fig.7 B), giving an optimalf/f0 value of 1.4. Analysis of separate sedimentation data collected at a lower rotor speed (20,000 rpm) also generated excellent fits to an identical sedimentation coefficient distribution. The fitted sedimentation coefficient distribution (Fig. 8) reveals a broad distribution of species between ∼10 and 40 S and a modal sedimentation coefficient of 18 S. A sedimentation coefficient of 18 S corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼600 kDa, consistent with previous studies (30Loutas J. Stevens A. Howlett G.J. Augusteyn R.C. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 62: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) showing that α-crystallin exists as heterogeneous complexes of molecular mass in the 300-kDa to 10-MDa range, averaging 600 kDa. Continuous size distribution analysis of apoC-II in the presence of α-crystallin also produced excellent fits (gray lines in Fig. 7 C). The sedimentation coefficient distribution shows a peak near 1 S corresponding to monomeric apoC-II (data not shown) and a range of sedimentation coefficient values identical to the distribution for α-crystallin alone (Fig. 8) suggesting that the sedimentation behavior of α-crystallin is not significantly affected by the presence of apoC-II.Figure 8Continuous sedimentation coefficient distributions for α-crystallin in the presence (dashed line) and absence (solid line) of apoC-II.

Whereas hydrophobic interactions are involved in the chaperone action of α-crystallin, the specific mechanism of this interaction is not known (33Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 34Raman B. Ramakrishna T. Rao C.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35Carver J.A.

Stoichiometric concentrations of α-crystallin are required to significantly suppress this aggregation (23Lindner R.A. Treweek T.M. Carver J.A. Biochem.

From a variety of studies, it has been concluded that α-crystallin interacts specifically with partly folded intermediates that deviate from the protein folding pathway along the off-folding pathway toward an aggregated and precipitating species (23Lindner R.A. Treweek T.M. Carver J.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar,31Lindner R.A. Kapur A. Carver J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 27722-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast, we observe that only sub-stoichiometric concentrations of α-crystallin are required to inhibit the aggregation of apoC-II (Fig.1). An explanation for the mechanism of action of α-crystallin on apoC-II aggregation requires consideration of the conformational properties of apoC-II under lipid-free conditions. Monomeric apoC-II exists as an unfolded protein in the absence of lipid as indicated by the CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the shape of monomeric apoC-II derived from its sedimentation coefficient (s = 0.96 S) indicates an ellipsoid axial ratio of 4.9, suggesting an extended conformation characteristic of unfolded proteins (15Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). From the analytical ultracentrifugation data (Figs. 2, 5, 7, and 8), there is no evidence of an interaction between monomeric apoC-II and α-crystallin, consistent with previous observations that α-crystallin does not bind to unfolded proteins (35Carver J.A. Guerreiro N. Nicholls K.A. Truscott R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that α-crystallin recognizes and binds to an intermediate on the amyloid formation pathway. A recent study (27Ferrone F.

This complex is distinct to amyloid “seeds” that are small fragments of amyloid fibers containing reactive ends for polymerization. According to this hypothesis, the nucleus undergoes a transformation into a fibril that subsequently recruits monomers and grows rapidly. In the case of apoC-II our gel filtration and sedimentation velocity data indicate no accumulation of intermediate sized species between monomers and large molecular mass aggregates, implying that amyloid extension is comparatively rapid upon nucleation. The proposed mechanism for amyloid formation by apoC-II and the effect of α-crystallin inhibition on this process are presented in Fig.9. An equilibrium between monomers (species 1) and nuclei (species 2) results in a very low concentration of nuclei at an apoC-II concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Although the nucleus is likely to be a partly structured oligomeric complex of apoC-II (species 2), we cannot rule out the possibility that the nucleus is an altered (intermediately folded) monomeric form created through slow folding events such as proline isomerization. The concentration of nuclei (species 2) provides the rate-limiting step for amyloid formation, since upon progression to a fibril (conversion of species 2 tospecies 3), monomers are rapidly recruited to the polymer (species 4). We propose that α-crystallin (species 5) interacts stoichiometrically with the nucleus (species 2) to form species 6, preventing its progression into amyloid by promoting its dissociation back to monomer (species 1) and free α-crystallin (species 5). Thus, α-crystallin shifts the equilibrium toward the monomeric apoC-II species. It is apparent from this mechanism that inhibition of apoC-II fibril formation by α-crystallin occurs via a transitory complex of the two species (species 6). By contrast, α-crystallin forms strongly bound complexes with proteins that form amorphous aggregates. Under heat-stressed conditions, these strongly bound complexes seem to be irreversibly associated (16Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 10: 52-59Crossref Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 17Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). If the amyloid nucleus is oligomeric, we might expect that the ability of α-crystallin to inhibit amyloid nucleation is dependent on the apoC-II concentration. For example, the concentration of oligomer of size n will vary according to the nth power of monomer concentration. This effect is apparent from the reduction in the ability of α-crystallin to inhibit the aggregation of α-crystallin at higher concentrations of apoC-II. For example, turbidity studies using 1.0 mg/ml apoC-II in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml α-crystallin (22:1 molar ratio, respectively) indicated less effective inhibition of amyloid formation by apoC-II (data not shown) than for an equivalent molar ratio of α-crystallin and apoC-II using 0.3 mg/ml apoC-II. Our results can be compared with the effect of αB-crystallin on amyloid formation by the Alzheimer's related peptide, Aβ (19Stege G.J. Renkawek K. Overkamp P.S. Verschuure P. van Rijk A.F. Reijnen-Aalbers A. Boelens W.C. Bosman G.J. de Jong W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). αB-Crystallin altered fibril growth of Aβ significantly such that only small, non-regular fibrils were formed. In contrast to our results with apoC-II, αB-crystallin formed complexes with Aβ with increased light-scattering properties and substantially enhanced thioflavin T binding (19Stege G.J. Renkawek K. Overkamp P.S. Verschuure P. van Rijk A.F. Reijnen-Aalbers A. Boelens W.C. Bosman G.J. de Jong W.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Hsp27, a mammalian small heat-shock protein, potently slows the initial rate of fibril formation by Aβ (18Kudva Y.C. Hiddinga H.J. Butler P.C. Mueske C.S. Eberhardt N.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggesting an effect on an early step in fibril formation without altering fibril elongation. This conclusion is similar to the results of our studies implying that α-crystallin inhibits amyloid formation by direct interaction with amyloid precursors (nuclei) leading to reduced nucleation rates rather than reduced elongation of existing amyloid fibrils.

Two different human 15-LOs have been identified that differ in tissue distribution and substrate preference. 15-LO-1 is expressed in reticulocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, and skin (2Funk C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1304: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). 15-LO-2 has limited tissue distribution, with mRNA detected in prostate, lung, skin, and cornea (3Shappell S.B.

In terms of enzymatic characteristics, 15-LO-1 preferentially metabolizes linoleic acid primarily to 13-(S)-HODE but also metabolizes arachidonic acid to 15-(S)-HETE. 15-LO-2, on the other hand, converts arachidonic acid to 15-(S)-HETE and metabolizes linoleic acid poorly (4Brash A.R.

This study provided the first evidence that 15-LO-1 is clearly expressed in human colorectal carcinoma cells, and it was subsequently shown that the 15-LO-1 is uniquely regulated by histone acetylation (6Kamitani H. Taniura S. Ikawa H. Watanabe T. Kelavkar U.P. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human colon tumors have elevated levels of 15-LO-1 compared with the normal adjacent tissue (7Ikawa H. Kamitani H. Calvo B.F. Foley J.F. Eling T.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 360-366PubMed Google Scholar). The increased expression in tumors and regulation being linked to histone acetylation suggests a possible role for 15-LO-1 in tumor development.Human colon carcinomas express peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily involved in fat cell differentiation and glucose homeostasis (8Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Ligand activation of this receptor causes most, but not all, colon cancer cell lines to undergo a differentiative response and reverse their malignant phenotype (9Sarraf P. Mueller E. Jones D.

All this taken together suggests that PPARγ could be a tumor suppressor.Recently, metabolites of 15-LO-1 have been reported to serve as ligands for PPARγ. Metabolites of 15-LO-1 show binding activity in a reporter system for PPARγ ligand binding (17Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(S)-HpODE, and 15-(S)-HETE all show binding activity for PPARγ, but at relatively high concentrations (17Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). This is supported by a recent study done in macrophages, where PPARγ activation has been shown in 15-LO-1 transfected macrophages using linoleic and arachidonic acid as substrates (18Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). These data suggest that endogenous 15-LO-1 and its metabolites are ligands for PPARγ. Thus, based on these results, one could conclude that 15-LO-1 may have anti-tumorigenic activity. However, this seems to be in conflict with the finding that 15-LO-1 expression is elevated in tumorsversus normal tissue (7Ikawa H. Kamitani H. Calvo B.F. Foley J.F. Eling T.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 360-366PubMed Google Scholar).15-LO-1 metabolites stimulate epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent cell growth in Syrian hamster embryo cells. The metabolites 13-(S)-HpODE and 13-(S)-HODE enhance EGF-induced mitogenesis (19Glasgow W.C. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, EGF stimulated the metabolism of exogenous or endogenous linoleic acid to 13-(S)-HpODE/13-(S)-HODE, dependent on tyrosine kinase activity. The addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibited not only EGF-induced mitogenesis but also the formation of 15-LO-1 metabolites. Furthermore, the exogenous addition of 13-(S)-HpODE or 13-(S)-HODE, but not 15-(S)-HETE, in combination with EGF to Syrian hamster embryo cells inhibited the dephosphorylation of the EGF receptor, thereby up-regulating the EGF cascade and potentiating the mitogenic response (20Glasgow W.C. Hui R. Everhart A.L. Jayawickreme S.P. Angerman-Stewart J. Han B.B. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19269-19276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The 15-LO-1 linoleic acid metabolites, 13-(S)-HpODE and 13-(S)-HODE, up-regulated EGF-dependent cell proliferation and enhanced MAPK activity, but the 15-LO-2 arachidonic acid metabolite, 15-(S)-HETE, was not active.In this study, we found that in HCT-116 cells overexpression of 15-LO-1 down-regulates PPARγ via the MAPK signaling pathway. The 15-LO-1 metabolite 13-HODE up-regulates MAPK activity and PPARγ phosphorylation, resulting in a down-regulation of PPARγ activity. Thus, 15-LO-1 metabolites may not only serve as ligands for PPARγ but can affect PPARγ activity via the MAPK signaling pathway. This is a novel and potentially important mechanism involving 15-LO-1 and PPARγ.DISCUSSIONTwo metabolites of linoleic acid, 13-HODE and 9-HODE, and the metabolite of arachidonic acid, 15-HETE, formed by 15-lipoxygenase have been shown to bind and activate PPARγ (17Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) in vitro. This finding suggests that 15-HETE, 13-HODE, and 9-HODE may function as endogenous ligands for PPARγ. However, these findings were observed with high concentrations of the metabolites (30–100 μm). Although many naturally occurring fatty acids and their metabolites can activate PPARγ, they bind with relatively low affinities and must be added to cells at high concentrations to stimulate transcription. It has therefore been difficult to establish the physiological relevance of any of these lipid substances as regulators of PPARγ in vivo.In this study, we have found that 13-HODE at 1–10 μm can down-regulate PPARγ activity by increasing phosphorylation mediated via the MAPK signaling pathway. The addition of exogenous 13-(S)-HODE, at lower concentrations than used to observe binding to PPARγ, up-regulates both the EGF- and serum-dependent MAPK pathway and subsequently PPARγ phosphorylation. The addition of a MEK inhibitor results in the inhibition of MAPK activity and subsequently PPARγ phosphorylation, which supports the conclusion that PPARγ phosphorylation is mediated by MAPK as reported in fat cells (29Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is specific for linoleic acid metabolites as 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(R)-HODE, and 13-(S)-HpODE all have the same effect, while 15-(S)-HETE, an arachidonic acid metabolite, was inactive and in fact appeared to inhibit phosphorylation.To test the effects of endogenous 15-LO-1 metabolites, we constructed stable 15-LO-1 overexpressing cells. By treating these cells with linoleic acid, a substrate for 15-LO-1, we could examine if endogenous 15-LO-1 metabolites would increase MAPK and PPARγ phosphorylation. Interestingly, endogenous metabolites had the same effect as addition of exogenous 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(R)-HODE, or 13-(S)-HpODE. In HCT-116 cells, endogeneous 15-LO-1 metabolites up-regulate MAPK activity and hence increase PPARγ phosphorylation. It has been well documented in the literature that phosphorylation of PPARγ results in a decrease in transcriptional activity (29Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 30Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31771-31774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Since phosphorylation of PPARγ inhibits its transcriptional activity, 15-LO-1 metabolites down-regulate PPARγ activity via the MAPK signaling pathway.MAPK, a central regulator of cell growth, can modify PPARγ in a way that significantly reduces PPARγ transcriptional activity (30Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 33Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of a key residue, Ser82 on PPARγ1, results in a decrease in transcriptional activity (29Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). MAPK may be particularly suitable for this purpose because, among the signal transduction machinery linked to the cell cycle, MAPK can enter the nucleus to modify transcription factors (34Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that MAPK has been implicated in the phosphorylation of another nuclear receptor, the estrogen receptor, although this correlates with an increase in transcriptional activity (35Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushuge S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar, 36Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 9: 2174-2183Crossref Scopus (845) Google Scholar).In this study, 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(R)-HODE, and 13-(S)-HpODE all had similar effects resulting in the down-regulation of PPARγ activity. Interestingly, however, 15-(S)-HETE appeared to inhibit MAPK or PPARγ phosphorylation. 15-(S)-HETE is the main arachidonic acid metabolite formed by 15-LO-2 activity. 15-LO-2 metabolizes arachidonic acid to 15-(S)-HETE but metabolizes linoleic acid poorly (4Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to 15-LO-1, which preferentially metabolizes linoleic acid primarily to 13-(S)-HODE. This result is particularly intriguing given the fact that 15-LO-2 has been found to be expressed higher in normal prostate tissue than in adjacent tumor tissue (3Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to 15-LO-1, which has been found to be more highly expressed in tumor than normal colon tissue (7Ikawa H. Kamitani H. Calvo B.F. Foley J.F. Eling T.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 360-366PubMed Google Scholar) and in prostate adenocarcinoma compared with normal tissue (37Kelavkar U.P. Cohen C. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Badr K.F. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that there may be different roles for 15-LO-1 and 15-LO-2. 15-LO-1 may be involved in the tumorigenic process, while 15-LO-2 may be involved in normal tissue function. The role of 15-LO-1 versus15-LO-2 will need to be further investigated to clarify their functions.The fact that loss-of-function mutations in PPARγ are associated with colon cancer suggests that activation of this receptor might have an anti-cancer effect in this disease (16Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Ligand activation of PPARγ stimulates a dramatic differentiation response in one type of solid tumor, liposarcoma, in human patients (38Demetri G.D. Fletcher C.D. Mueller E. Sarraf P. Naujoks R. Campbell N. Spiegelman B.M. Singer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The fact that 15-LO-1 metabolites can shut down PPARγ via the MAPK signaling pathway essentially has the same net effect as a loss-of-function mutation in PPARγ. 15-LO-1 metabolites cause a down-regulation of PPARγ activity, and this suggests a pro-tumorigenic role in colorectal carcinogenesis.The interaction between 15-LO-1 and PPARγ signaling can occur at several levels, and the balance between the two opposite biological effects of the metabolites could be an important regulator of PPARγ transcriptional activity in colorectal cells (Fig.10). The 15-LO-1 metabolites of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid are ligands for PPARγ, but this response is observed at relatively high concentrations, and most of these studies employed exogenous metabolites (17Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 15-LO-1 linoleic acid metabolites, 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(R)-HODE, and 13-(S)-HpODE, enhance growth factor-dependent MAPK activity, which down-regulates PPARγ by increasing phosphorylation. This effect was observed at lower concentrations of the 15-LO-1 metabolites and from endogenously generated metabolites. Thus, a balance between these two opposing effects could determine the role 15-LO-1 plays in the development of colorectal cancer. The down-regulation of PPARγ by linoleic acid metabolites may provide the rationale to explain why 15-LO-1 is up-regulated in colon cancer. Lipoxygenases (LOs)1 are lipid-peroxidizing enzymes that are categorized according to their position of oxygenation of arachidonic acid (1Yamamoto S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). For example, 15-LOs oxygenate the substrate arachidonic acid at C-15.

Taniura S. Ikawa H. Watanabe T. Kelavkar U.P. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human colon tumors have elevated levels of 15-LO-1 compared with the normal adjacent tissue (7Ikawa H. Kamitani H. Calvo B.F. Foley J.F. Eling T.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 360-366PubMed Google Scholar). The increased expression in tumors and regulation being linked to histone acetylation suggests a possible role for 15-LO-1 in tumor development. Human colon carcinomas express peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily involved in fat cell differentiation and glucose homeostasis (8Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Ligand activation of this receptor causes most, but not all, colon cancer cell lines to undergo a differentiative response and reverse their malignant phenotype (9Sarraf P. Mueller E. Jones D.

Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Furthermore, colon cancer in humans is associated with loss-of-function mutations in PPARγ (16Sarraf P.

All this taken together suggests that PPARγ could be a tumor suppressor. Recently, metabolites of 15-LO-1 have been reported to serve as ligands for PPARγ. Metabolites of 15-LO-1 show binding activity in a reporter system for PPARγ ligand binding (17Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(S)-HpODE, and 15-(S)-HETE all show binding activity for PPARγ, but at relatively high concentrations (17Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). This is supported by a recent study done in macrophages, where PPARγ activation has been shown in 15-LO-1 transfected macrophages using linoleic and arachidonic acid as substrates (18Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). These data suggest that endogenous 15-LO-1 and its metabolites are ligands for PPARγ. Thus, based on these results, one could conclude that 15-LO-1 may have anti-tumorigenic activity. However, this seems to be in conflict with the finding that 15-LO-1 expression is elevated in tumorsversus normal tissue (7Ikawa H. Kamitani H. Calvo B.F. Foley J.F. Eling T.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 360-366PubMed Google Scholar). 15-LO-1 metabolites stimulate epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent cell growth in Syrian hamster embryo cells. The metabolites 13-(S)-HpODE and 13-(S)-HODE enhance EGF-induced mitogenesis (19Glasgow W.C. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10771-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, EGF stimulated the metabolism of exogenous or endogenous linoleic acid to 13-(S)-HpODE/13-(S)-HODE, dependent on tyrosine kinase activity. The addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibited not only EGF-induced mitogenesis but also the formation of 15-LO-1 metabolites. Furthermore, the exogenous addition of 13-(S)-HpODE or 13-(S)-HODE, but not 15-(S)-HETE, in combination with EGF to Syrian hamster embryo cells inhibited the dephosphorylation of the EGF receptor, thereby up-regulating the EGF cascade and potentiating the mitogenic response (20Glasgow W.C. Hui R. Everhart A.L. Jayawickreme S.P. Angerman-Stewart J. Han B.B. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19269-19276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The 15-LO-1 linoleic acid metabolites, 13-(S)-HpODE and 13-(S)-HODE, up-regulated EGF-dependent cell proliferation and enhanced MAPK activity, but the 15-LO-2 arachidonic acid metabolite, 15-(S)-HETE, was not active. In this study, we found that in HCT-116 cells overexpression of 15-LO-1 down-regulates PPARγ via the MAPK signaling pathway. The 15-LO-1 metabolite 13-HODE up-regulates MAPK activity and PPARγ phosphorylation, resulting in a down-regulation of PPARγ activity. Thus, 15-LO-1 metabolites may not only serve as ligands for PPARγ but can affect PPARγ activity via the MAPK signaling pathway. This is a novel and potentially important mechanism involving 15-LO-1 and PPARγ. DISCUSSIONTwo metabolites of linoleic acid, 13-HODE and 9-HODE, and the metabolite of arachidonic acid, 15-HETE, formed by 15-lipoxygenase have been shown to bind and activate PPARγ (17Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar) in vitro. This finding suggests that 15-HETE, 13-HODE, and 9-HODE may function as endogenous ligands for PPARγ. However, these findings were observed with high concentrations of the metabolites (30–100 μm). Although many naturally occurring fatty acids and their metabolites can activate PPARγ, they bind with relatively low affinities and must be added to cells at high concentrations to stimulate transcription. It has therefore been difficult to establish the physiological relevance of any of these lipid substances as regulators of PPARγ in vivo.In this study, we have found that 13-HODE at 1–10 μm can down-regulate PPARγ activity by increasing phosphorylation mediated via the MAPK signaling pathway. The addition of exogenous 13-(S)-HODE, at lower concentrations than used to observe binding to PPARγ, up-regulates both the EGF- and serum-dependent MAPK pathway and subsequently PPARγ phosphorylation. The addition of a MEK inhibitor results in the inhibition of MAPK activity and subsequently PPARγ phosphorylation, which supports the conclusion that PPARγ phosphorylation is mediated by MAPK as reported in fat cells (29Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is specific for linoleic acid metabolites as 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(R)-HODE, and 13-(S)-HpODE all have the same effect, while 15-(S)-HETE, an arachidonic acid metabolite, was inactive and in fact appeared to inhibit phosphorylation.To test the effects of endogenous 15-LO-1 metabolites, we constructed stable 15-LO-1 overexpressing cells. By treating these cells with linoleic acid, a substrate for 15-LO-1, we could examine if endogenous 15-LO-1 metabolites would increase MAPK and PPARγ phosphorylation. Interestingly, endogenous metabolites had the same effect as addition of exogenous 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(R)-HODE, or 13-(S)-HpODE. In HCT-116 cells, endogeneous 15-LO-1 metabolites up-regulate MAPK activity and hence increase PPARγ phosphorylation. It has been well documented in the literature that phosphorylation of PPARγ results in a decrease in transcriptional activity (29Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 30Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31771-31774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Since phosphorylation of PPARγ inhibits its transcriptional activity, 15-LO-1 metabolites down-regulate PPARγ activity via the MAPK signaling pathway.MAPK, a central regulator of cell growth, can modify PPARγ in a way that significantly reduces PPARγ transcriptional activity (30Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 33Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of a key residue, Ser82 on PPARγ1, results in a decrease in transcriptional activity (29Camp H.S. Tafuri S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10811-10816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). MAPK may be particularly suitable for this purpose because, among the signal transduction machinery linked to the cell cycle, MAPK can enter the nucleus to modify transcription factors (34Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that MAPK has been implicated in the phosphorylation of another nuclear receptor, the estrogen receptor, although this correlates with an increase in transcriptional activity (35Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushuge S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H Metzger D. Chambon P.

EMBO J. 1996; 9: 2174-2183Crossref Scopus (845) Google Scholar).In this study, 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(R)-HODE, and 13-(S)-HpODE all had similar effects resulting in the down-regulation of PPARγ activity. Interestingly, however, 15-(S)-HETE appeared to inhibit MAPK or PPARγ phosphorylation. 15-(S)-HETE is the main arachidonic acid metabolite formed by 15-LO-2 activity. 15-LO-2 metabolizes arachidonic acid to 15-(S)-HETE but metabolizes linoleic acid poorly (4Brash A.R. Boeglin W.E. Chang M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6148-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to 15-LO-1, which preferentially metabolizes linoleic acid primarily to 13-(S)-HODE. This result is particularly intriguing given the fact that 15-LO-2 has been found to be expressed higher in normal prostate tissue than in adjacent tumor tissue (3Shappell S.B. Boeglin W.E. Olson S.J. Kasper S. Brash A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to 15-LO-1, which has been found to be more highly expressed in tumor than normal colon tissue (7Ikawa H. Kamitani H. Calvo B.F. Foley J.F. Eling T.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 360-366PubMed Google Scholar) and in prostate adenocarcinoma compared with normal tissue (37Kelavkar U.P. Cohen C. Kamitani H. Eling T.E. Badr K.F. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1777-1787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that there may be different roles for 15-LO-1 and 15-LO-2. 15-LO-1 may be involved in the tumorigenic process, while 15-LO-2 may be involved in normal tissue function. The role of 15-LO-1 versus15-LO-2 will need to be further investigated to clarify their functions.The fact that loss-of-function mutations in PPARγ are associated with colon cancer suggests that activation of this receptor might have an anti-cancer effect in this disease (16Sarraf P. Mueller E. Smith W.M. Wright H.M. Kum J.B. Aaltonen L.A. de la Chapelle A. Spiegelman B.M. Eng C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 799-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Ligand activation of PPARγ stimulates a dramatic differentiation response in one type of solid tumor, liposarcoma, in human patients (38Demetri G.D. Fletcher C.D. Mueller E. Sarraf P. Naujoks R. Campbell N. Spiegelman B.M. Singer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3951-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The fact that 15-LO-1 metabolites can shut down PPARγ via the MAPK signaling pathway essentially has the same net effect as a loss-of-function mutation in PPARγ. 15-LO-1 metabolites cause a down-regulation of PPARγ activity, and this suggests a pro-tumorigenic role in colorectal carcinogenesis.The interaction between 15-LO-1 and PPARγ signaling can occur at several levels, and the balance between the two opposite biological effects of the metabolites could be an important regulator of PPARγ transcriptional activity in colorectal cells (Fig.10). The 15-LO-1 metabolites of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid are ligands for PPARγ, but this response is observed at relatively high concentrations, and most of these studies employed exogenous metabolites (17Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 15-LO-1 linoleic acid metabolites, 13-(S)-HODE, 13-(R)-HODE, and 13-(S)-HpODE, enhance growth factor-dependent MAPK activity, which down-regulates PPARγ by increasing phosphorylation. This effect was observed at lower concentrations of the 15-LO-1 metabolites and from endogenously generated metabolites. Thus, a balance between these two opposing effects could determine the role 15-LO-1 plays in the development of colorectal cancer. The down-regulation of PPARγ by linoleic acid metabolites may provide the rationale to explain why 15-LO-1 is up-regulated in colon cancer. Two metabolites of linoleic acid, 13-HODE and 9-HODE, and the metabolite of arachidonic acid, 15-HETE, formed by 15-lipoxygenase have been shown to bind and activate PPARγ (17Nagy L. Tontonoz P.

https://openalex.org/W2037870084,"Many cell types mount elaborate, compensatory responses to stress that enhance survival; however, the intracellular signals that govern these responses are poorly understood. Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a stress-induced cytokine, belongs to the interleukin-6/glycoprotein 130 receptor-coupled cytokine family. CT-1 is released from the heart in response to hypoxic stress, and it protects cardiac myocytes from hypoxia-induced apoptosis, thus establishing a central role for this cytokine in the cardiac stress response. In the present study, CT-1 activated p38 and ERK MAPKs as well as Akt in cultured cardiac myocytes; these three pathways were activated in a parallel manner. CT-1 also induced the degradation of the NF-κB cytosolic anchor, IκB, as well as the translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB to the nucleus and increased expression of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene. Inhibitors of the p38, ERK, or Akt pathways each partially reduced CT-1-mediated NF-κB activation, as well as the cytoprotective effects of CT-1 against hypoxic stress. Together, the inhibitors completely blocked CT-1-dependent NF-κB activation and cytoprotection. A cell-permeable peptide that selectively disrupted NF-κB activation also completely inhibited the cytoprotective effects of CT-1. These results indicate that CT-1 signals through p38, ERK, and Akt in a parallel manner to activate NF-κB and that NF-κB is required for CT-1 to mediate its full cytoprotective effects in cardiac myocytes.

CT-1 also induced the degradation of the NF-κB cytosolic anchor, IκB, as well as the translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB to the nucleus and increased expression of an NF-κB-dependent reporter gene. Inhibitors of the p38, ERK, or Akt pathways each partially reduced CT-1-mediated NF-κB activation, as well as the cytoprotective effects of CT-1 against hypoxic stress. Together, the inhibitors completely blocked CT-1-dependent NF-κB activation and cytoprotection. A cell-permeable peptide that selectively disrupted NF-κB activation also completely inhibited the cytoprotective effects of CT-1. These results indicate that CT-1 signals through p38, ERK, and Akt in a parallel manner to activate NF-κB and that NF-κB is required for CT-1 to mediate its full cytoprotective effects in cardiac myocytes. interleukin cardiotrophin-1 glycoprotein mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium NEMO binding domain analysis of variance terminal dUTP nick-end labeling phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hypoxia/reoxygenation TGF-β-activated protein kinase transforming growth factor MAPK/ERK kinase The mechanisms that cells use to mount protective responses against potentially harmful stresses have been the focus of many recent studies. An emerging theme from these studies is that cellular stress responses can lead to the release of cytokines, which can behave in a paracrine manner to enhance survival, often by inhibiting apoptosis (1Craig R.

In certain organs, such as the heart or the brain, the release of cytoprotective cytokines in response to stress, perhaps even mild stresses, may serve critical cytoprotective roles. Cytokines related to interleukin-6 (IL-6)1 compose a family of substances known to play cytoprotective and growth-promoting roles in many different cell types. These cytokines include IL-6, itself, as well as leukemic inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor and, the more recently discovered, cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1). CT-1 is a 21.5-kDa protein that was named after its ability to stimulate the growth of cultured cardiac myocytes (5Wollert K.C. Taga T. Saito M. Narazaki M. Kishimoto T. Glembotski C.C.

However, it is now clear that CT-1 is also expressed in many other tissues and that it exhibits important functional roles in those tissues. For example, in addition to the heart, CT-1 is expressed in the brain, lungs, liver, and kidneys (8Sheng Z. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Chien K.R. Development. 1996; 122: 419-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, CT-1 not only induces growth of the heart but also the liver, kidney, and spleen (9Jin H. Yang R. Keller G.A. Ryan A. Ko A. Finkle D. Swanson T.A. Li W. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Paoni N.F. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In vitro, CT-1 has been found to foster the survival of sympathetic and motor neurons by inhibiting apoptosis (10Thier M. Marz P. Otten U. Weis J. Rose-John S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Middleton G. Hamanoue M. Enokido Y. Wyatt S. Pennica D. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Davies A.M. J.

CT-1 has also been shown to stimulate the acute phase activation of gene expression in hepatocytes (13Heymann D. Rousselle A.V. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1455-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 14Richards C.D. Langdon C. Deschamps P. Pennica D. Shaughnessy S.G.

Cytokine. 2000; 12: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, CT-1 possesses potentially important growth-promoting and cell survival roles in a number of tissues, thus emphasizing the importance of understanding the signaling mechanisms governing the effects of this cytokine. The IL-6 family of cytokines bind first to ligand-specific receptors and then they couple through a common, gp130 cell-surface receptor to the activation of a variety of intracellular pathways that could contribute to their cell survival effects (15Latchman D.S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 85: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For example, CT-1 can activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the protein kinase B (or Akt) pathways (16Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J.

Biol. 2001; 21: 2324-2336Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The mechanisms mediating the cytoprotective effects of CT-1 through these or other pathways form the topics of active investigation and of the present study. One manner in which a variety of signaling pathways mediate protection from apoptosis involves activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB, which in turn induces the expression of proteins that possess cytoprotective roles (1Craig R. Larkin A. Mingo A.M. Thuerauf D.J. Andrews C. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23814-23824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). For example, in cardiac myocytes, activation of the p38 MAPK pathway by a p38-specific upstream MAPK kinase, MKK6, can foster protection from apoptosis, which is in large part mediated by NF-κB (22Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether CT-1 can activate p38. However, because CT-1 is known to activate ERK and Akt, and because these pathways have been shown to activate NF-κB (23Beraud C. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 24Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), it is quite possible that the cytoprotective effects of CT-1 require activation of all three MAPK family members that converge on NF-κB. Accordingly, the present study was undertaken to test the following three hypotheses: 1) in addition to ERK and Akt, CT-1 activates p38; 2) ERK, Akt, and p38 all contribute to the activation of NF-κB; and 3) NF-κB activation is required for the anti-apoptotic effects of CT-1. To test these hypotheses, the ability of CT-1 to protect cells from apoptotic death was evaluated using a well characterized, cultured cardiac myocyte model system. This is a particularly appropriate model system for these studies, since it is believed that the CT-1, which is released from the heart in vivo in response to hypoxia, acts in an autocrine or paracrine manner to serve potentially critical cardioprotective roles (26Kuwahara K. Saito Y. Harada M. Ishikawa M. Ogawa E. Miyamoto Y. Hamanaka I. Kamitani S. Kajiyama N. Takahashi N. Nakagawa O. Masuda I. Nakao K. Circulation. 1999; 100: 1116-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Primary ventricular myocyte cell cultures were prepared from 1- to 4-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described (27Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The apical two-thirds of the ventricle were dissected away from the atria in DMEM/air. Ventricles were minced and washed twice with air-compatible, HEPES-buffered DMEM. The isolation of cells was accomplished by multiple 10-min rounds of tissue dissociation using 0.0025% trypsin. After each trypsin incubation, the supernatant was added to an equal volume of DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, and all of the supernatants were combined. Cells were initially suspended in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated onto plastic culture dishes for 2 h, during which time most of the non-cardiac myocytes attach to the dish, whereas the myocytes remain in suspension. After 2 h, the suspended myocytes were collected by centrifugation and then resuspended in DMEM F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cardiac myocytes were plated onto plastic culture wells, which had been pre-treated for at least 1 h with fibronectin at 5 μg/ml DMEM/F-12 (1:1). Alternatively, myocytes were plated onto 2-chamber Lab-TekTM glass slides (Nalgen Nunc International) which had been pre-treated for at least 1 h with fibronectin at 25 μg/ml DMEM/F-12 (1:1). For TUNEL analysis and for immunocytofluorescence experiments, myocytes were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per Lab-TekTM glass slide chamber. For Western analyses, myocytes were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells per 35-mm plastic culture dish. Following pre-plating, myocytes were resuspended in serum-free DMEM/F-12 (1:1), and 4–6 × 106 cells were combined with 12–45 μg of the indicated plasmids in a total volume of 300 μl. The total quantity of plasmid DNA used in each electroporation was equalized using pCMV6, when necessary. The optimal quantity of each plasmid was determined in preliminary dose-response experiments. Cells were electroporated at 500 V, 25 microfarads, and 100 ohms in a 0.2-cm gap electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). Under these conditions, ∼10% of the cardiac myocytes are transfected, whereas any remaining non-myocytes are not transfected (27Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Following transfection, cells were plated at a density of 0.6 × 106 cells per fibronectin-coated, 24-mm plastic culture dish. The following plasmids were used as indicated in this study. pCH110-LacZ, which codes for a galactosidase reporter driven by the SV40 promoter, was obtained fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech (code 27-4509-01). p2X NF-κB, which codes for a luciferase reporter driven by a minimal prolactin promoter with two nearby, upstream NF-κB consensus sites (29DiDonato J.

Haegeman (University of Gent, Belgium). pG5E1b-Luc, which encodes a luciferase reporter driven by five GAL4-binding sites (30Seth A. Gonzalez F.A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Sugita (Tanabe Seiyaku Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). pEXV3-MAPKK1-Ala-217, which encodes a dominant negative mutant of MAPKK1/MEK1, was obtained from S. Fuller (Imperial College, London, UK). pMT-DN110, which encodes the first 100 amino acids of bovine p110α subunit of PI3K and acts as a dominant negative by binding to p85, was obtained from T. Franke (Columbia University, New York). After the indicated times, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EDTA, 0.25% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cell debris was eliminated by centrifugation, and 200-μl samples of each cell lysate were combined with 400 μl of galactosidase buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4) containing 1 mg/ml chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. After incubation for 2 h, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm. After cell lysis and removal of cell debris by centrifugation, as described above, 100-μl samples of cell lysate were combined with 100 μl of luciferase buffer (25 mmGly-Gly, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mmEGTA, 45 mm KPO4, pH 7.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 mm d-luciferin, 3 mm ATP). An MGM Instruments OptoComp II luminometer was used to measure light emission of each sample for 10 s. Relative luciferase activities were determined by dividing luciferase values by β-galactosidase values. In order to determine the effects of CT-1 on cellular localization of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, myocardial cells treated ±1 nm CT-1 were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Immunocytofluorescence was carried out using a polyclonal antibody raised against p65/NF-κB (1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Myocardial cells were treated ±1 nm CT-1 for the indicated times. Cells were then lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer that had been supplemented with 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, boiled for 5 min, and then submitted to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane in methanol transfer buffer at 60 V for 5 h or at 30 V for 12–18 h. Membranes were then treated for 30 min at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (0.01%). Western analyses were carried out using antisera specific for phospho-p38 (1:200), phospho-Akt (1:500), or phospho-ERK (1:1000). Blots were subsequently stripped with 6.25 mm Tris, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C, then washed for 1 h with Tris-buffered saline/Tween (0.01%), and re-probed with antisera specific for either p38 (1:200), Akt (1:500), or ERK (1:1000) for purposes of normalization. IκB Western was carried out using antisera specific for IκB (1:500). All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA. Densitometric analysis was carried out using Molecular Dynamics Image Quant software. Myocardial cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated slides for at least 70 h in DMEM/F-12 with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml). The medium was then replaced with glucose-free DMEM, base (Life Technologies, Inc., 23800-022), which had been saturated with N2/CO2 (95:5) for 10 min (hypoxia) or O2/CO2 (95:5) (control). Cells subjected to hypoxia were placed in a chamber filled with N2/CO2 (95:5) for 2 h. Subsequently, the hypoxia and control cells were incubated for 24 h in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) ±1 nm CT-1, 1 μm SB202190, 25 μm LY294002, 1 μm U0126, 200 μm NBD peptide, or 200 μm control peptide in an O2/CO2 (95:5), normoxic environment. Cell samples were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then stored in 0.4% paraformaldehyde until TUNEL analysis. Preliminary experiments established that 2 h of hypoxia followed by 24 h of reoxygenation resulted in the most consistent induction of 40–60% cell death by apoptosis. H/R-treated cells were subjected to TUNEL analyses (22Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was evaluated by viewing each field at × 40 magnification, as described previously (22Zechner D. Craig R. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Sabbadini R.A. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8232-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Generally, 10 different microscopic fields containing 10–15 cells each were recorded for each sample. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Following H/R treatment, Hoescht bisbenzimide (0.5 μg/ml) was added directly to culture media in the dark. Following 5–10 min of incubation at room temperature, propidium iodide (0.5 μg/ml) was added. Cells were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope equipped with a UV filter cube, using an excitation wavelength of 350 nm. Hoescht-stained nuclei appeared blue and were used for visualization of pyknosis, a characteristic feature of apoptosis. Propidium iodide staining was used to ensure that the nuclear membrane remained intact, as indicated by exclusion of propidium iodide, a feature of cells undergoing apoptosis. Images were analyzed at × 100 magnification and captured using X-Cap ImageTMsoftware. A 28-amino acid peptide was synthesized using an Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis strategy and purified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The peptide possesses the sequence derived fromAntennapedia homeodomain that mediates membrane translocation. The 17 N-terminal and 11 C-terminal amino acids span the NEMO binding domain of IKKβ (underlined), DRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKTALDWSWLQTE. This peptide, named NEMO binding domain (NBD) peptide, has been shown previously to inhibit the induction of NF-κB by disrupting the IKKβ-NEMO interaction (34May M.J. D'Acquisto F. Madge L.A. Glockner J. Pober J.S. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 289: 1550-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). A peptide with a similar size and chemical composition was synthesized and purified using the same procedure and was used as a non-active control peptide. CT-1 was purchased from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was purchased from Sigma (catalog number L-6529). SB202190 and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem. All antibodies and U0126 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA. Culture media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. To evaluate the effects of CT-1 on cell survival, cardiac myocytes were submitted to a well characterized H/R maneuver (35Hishinuma S. Funamoto M. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 36Mackay K. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1585-1588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The maneuver consisted of maintaining the cells in a hypoxic environment for 2 h and then in a normoxic environment for 24 h. TUNEL analysis indicated that, in general, control cells displayed no apparent DNA strand breaks (Fig.1A) and exhibited intact nuclei, as determined by Hoescht staining (Fig. 1B) coupled with propidium iodine staining (not shown). In contrast to control cells, a greater proportion of H/R-treated cells exhibited pyknotic, TUNEL-positive nuclei (Fig. 1, C and D), which are hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Treating the cultures with CT-1 during the reoxygenation phase 2Treating the cells with CT-1 during the hypoxia and reoxygenation phases had no further beneficial effect, and treatment with CT-1 only during hypoxia did not result in any significant reduction of apoptosis compared with no CT-1 treatment at all. These results indicated that all of the cytoprotective actions of CT-1 took place during reoxygenation. effectively abrogated H/R-mediated apoptosis of myocardial cells (Fig. 1, E andF). A quantitative analysis revealed that compared with control cells, myocardial cells subjected to H/R displayed an approximate 30% increase in apoptosis and the addition of 1 nm CT-1 during the reoxygenation phase of H/R resulted in protection from apoptosis (Fig. 1G, experiment 1). To investigate the potential roles of the p38, Akt, or ERK pathways in CT-1-mediated cytoprotection, myocytes were incubated with various cell-permeable inhibitors of these pathways during the reoxygenation phase of H/R. Under these conditions, SB202190, a specific inhibitor of p38α and p38β (37Young P. McDonnell P. Dunnington D. Hand A. Laydon J. Lee J. Agents Actions. 1993; 39: C67-C69Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), compromised the ability of CT-1 to protect the cardiac myocytes, resulting in ∼2-fold more apoptosis than observed in cells treated with H/R + CT-1 (Fig. 1G, experiment 2). LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, and thus, Akt (38Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also reduced the cytoprotective effects of CT-1, resulting in 2–3-fold more apoptosis than cells treated with H/R + CT-1 (Fig. 1G, experiment 3). U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2, and thus, ERK (39Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar), also diminished the cytoprotective effects of CT-1, resulting in ∼2-fold more apoptosis than cells treated with H/R + CT-1 (Fig.1G, experiment 4). These results show that the cytoprotective effects conferred by CT-1 against H/R-induced apoptosis are not only dependent upon the Akt, and ERK pathways, but also upon p38. Since inhibition of the p38, Akt, and ERK pathways compromised the cytoprotective effects of CT-1, the ability of the cytokine to activate these pathways was evaluated using antibodies specific for the residues in each kinase that are phosphorylated upon activation. The relative level of phospho-p38 was time-dependent and reached a maximum value of about 5-fold over control following 30 min of exposure to CT-1 (Fig.2A). Compared with control, the levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK were maximal following 15 min of exposure to CT-1 and amounted to about 10- and 16-fold over control, respectively (Fig. 2, B and C). These results are consistent with roles for all three signaling pathways in CT-1-mediated cytoprotection against H/R-induced apoptosis. The effects of each of the cell-permeable inhibitors on the levels of active p38, ERK, and Akt were assessed in the following experiment. The p38 inhibitor, SB202190, had no effect on CT-1-mediated p38 activation (Fig. 3A). This was not surprising, since SB202190 blocks the kinase activity of p38 (40Gum R.J. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Wang Z. Bower M.J. Lee J.C. Adams J.L. Livi G.P. Goldsmith E.J. Young P.R. J. Biol.

Neither LY294002 nor U0126 inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 by CT-1, indicating that CT-1 can activate p38 independently of the Akt and ERK pathways. In contrast, LY294002 or U0126 selectively blocked CT-1-activated Akt or ERK, respectively, whereas SB202190 had no effect on the active forms of either Akt or ERK, as expected (Fig. 3, B and C). These results substantiate the selective effects of the cell-permeable inhibitors, and they support the view that CT-1 can activate each of these three pathways independently. NF-κB can protect various cell types, including cardiac myocytes, from apoptosis (1Craig R. Larkin A. Mingo A.M. Thuerauf D.J. Andrews C. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol.

Accordingly, the effects of CT-1 on the activation of NF-κB were assessed using an NF-κB/luciferase reporter gene. CT-1 stimulated NF-κB-dependent reporter production in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in an approximate 5-fold activation over control at 5 nm CT-1 (Fig.4A). Under unstimulated conditions, NF-κB is retained in the cytosol by virtue of binding to an anchoring protein called inhibitor of κBα (IκBα) (41Ghosh S. Baltimore D.

Although numerous studies exist on renal organic cation transport of rat and rabbit, no information is available from humans. Therefore, we examined organic cation transport and its regulation across the basolateral membrane of isolated human proximal tubules. mRNA for the cation transporters hOCT1 and hOCT2 as well as hOCTN1 and hOCTN2 was detected in these tubules. Organic cation transport across the basolateral membrane of isolated collapsed proximal tubules was recorded with the fluorescent dye 4-(4-dimethylamino)styryl-N-methylpyridinium (ASP+). Depolarization of the cells by rising extracellular K+ concentration to 145 mm reduced ASP+ uptake by 20 ± 5% (n = 15), indicating its electrogeneity. The substrates of organic cation transport tetraethylammonium (Ki = 63 μm) and cimetidine (Ki = 11 μm) as well as the inhibitor quinine (Ki = 2.9 μm) reduced ASP+ uptake concentration dependently. Maximal inhibition reached with these substances was ∼60%. Stimulation of protein kinase C with 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG, 1 μm) or ATP (100 μm) inhibited ASP+ uptake by 30 ± 3 (n = 16) and 38 ± 13% (n = 6), respectively. The effect of DOG could be reduced with calphostin C (0.1 μm,n = 7). Activation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin (1 μm) decreased ASP+ uptake by 29 ± 3% (n = 10). hANP (10 nm) or 8-bromo-cGMP (100 μm) also decreased ASP+ uptake by 17 ± 3 (n = 9) or 32 ± 5% (n = 10), respectively.

Many of these substances are organic cations. As several drugs are among these organic cations, specific knowledge about properties of organic cation transport in the human proximal tubule is of great importance. The first organic cation transporter was cloned from rat (rOCT1) in 1994 (1Gründemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H.

Thus, organic cation transporters expressed in the luminal and basolateral membranes of the proximal tubule are molecularly and functionally very different members of this protein family.After cloning of the first transporters, studies were performed to gain information on properties of these organic cation transporters expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or cell lines (19Busch A.E.

Properties found for the cloned rOCT1 and rOCT2 do not always match with the properties determined for the proximal tubule in vivo obtained by micropuncture studies (7Ullrich K.J. Amidon G.L.

These differences may be due to the fact that additional transporters are involved in the in vivo situation or that transporter properties are modifiedin vivo under the influence of protein kinases, for example. Consequently, it is impossible to transfer results on organic cation transport in rat proximal tubule or from cloned transporters studied in expression systems to that of humans. Therefore, studies of organic cation transporters in isolated human proximal tubules, which are described in this study for the very first time, are urgently needed. This point is even more important considering the fact that the first observations indicate that organic cation transporters are regulated by protein kinases (26Berkhin E.B. Humphreys M.H. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 17-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Hohage H. Mörth D.M. Querl I.U. Greven J. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

So far regulation of the basolateral organic cation transport via protein kinase C (PKC)1 was demonstrated for the S2 segments of rabbit proximal tubule (27Hohage H. Mörth D.M. Querl I.U. Greven J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 897-901PubMed Google Scholar). In the apical membrane of a human proximal tubule cell line (IHKE-1), we found organic cation transport, probably mediated by the OCTNs, to be under the regulation of PKC, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) (29Hohage H. Stachon A. Feidt C. Hirsch J.R. Schlatter E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 305-310PubMed Google Scholar). Such a regulation could not be detected in a porcine cell line (LLC-PK-1), indicating the species differences also in the regulation of organic cation transport. Recently, we were able to demonstrate that the rat rOCT1 is activated by stimulation of PKA, PKC, and by tyrosine kinases (28Mehrens T. Lelleck S. Çetinkaya I. Knollmann M. Hohage H. Gorboulev V. Boknı́k P. Koepsell H. Schlatter E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1216-1224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Until now no data have been reported for organic cation transport across the basolateral membrane of human proximal tubules and for regulation of the cloned human transporters. As the sequences of the basolateral human organic cation transporters show several putative phosphorylation sites for PKC, PKA, and casein kinase II, it appears likely that human organic cation transporters are also under the control of these kinases (2Gorboulev V. Ulzheimer J.C. Akhoundova A. Ulzheimer-Teuber I. Karbach U. Quester S. Baumann C. Busch A.E. Lang F. Koepsell H. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar).Here we present the first data on organic cation transport in freshly isolated human proximal tubules obtained from human tumor nephrectomies, which resemble more closely the in vivosituation than any cell culture or expression system. Our goal was to study for the first time the uptake of organic cations across the basolateral membrane of isolated human proximal tubules which is the first step in the elimination of cationic xenobiotics and endogenous metabolites via the kidney. By using the fluorescent dye 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP+) and detecting the uptake with fluorescence microscopy, we were able to record human organic cation transport in real time and to study short time regulation. Special emphasis was placed on the mechanisms and basal properties of this transport and the identification of the involvement of various protein kinases in its regulation. Finally, RT-PCR was used to identify cloned transporters in freshly isolated human proximal tubules and to relate those findings to our functional data of organic cation transporters.RESULTSProximal tubules were isolated from kidney tissue from 34 male and 20 female patients. The average age of these patients was 58.6 ± 2.2 years, the youngest was 1 year and the oldest 79 years old. A total of 111 tubules was isolated from these kidneys and used for fluorescence measurements. From each of these kidney samples a minimum of one and a maximum of six tubules was used successfully. All experiments were done on the same day of the nephrectomy. Three additional kidney samples were used for RT-PCR analyses.Concentration Dependence of ASP+ UptakeTo demonstrate the concentration dependence of ASP+uptake across the basolateral membrane of human proximal tubules, a concentration response curve for ASP+ uptake was generated. Fig. 1 shows an original recording of ASP+ with various concentrations of ASP+ added to the bath. As the repetitive addition of ASP+ (1 or 2 μm) shows, the uptake was reproducible. As indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” we evaluated the initial uptake rates of ASP+ as these reflect the transport step whereas the maximal fluorescence reached depends on export from the cells, cellular compartmentation, or bleaching of ASP+. By using concentrations between 5 nm and 100 μm, the concentration response curve as shown in Fig.2 was obtained. As can be seen from this figure the initial rate of ASP+ uptake was not saturated at 100 μm, which was the highest concentration we could get in solution. First significant uptake was obtained at 100 nm. For all further experiments we used 500 nmof ASP+, a concentration that resulted in a significant cellular fluorescence increase but allowed fast and complete wash out of the dye.Figure 2Concentration dependence of ASP+uptake in human proximal tubules. Initial slope mean values ± S.E. of fluorescence increases with (n) indicating number of experiments. The first significant uptake was reached with an ASP+ concentration of 0.1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Electrogeneity of ASP+ UptakeNext we determined whether ASP+ uptake depends on the membrane voltage of proximal tubule cells, as would be expected for an electrogenic transporter like hOCT1 or hOCT2. ASP+ uptake under resting voltages with an extracellular K+concentration of 3.6 mm was compared with that of depolarized cells kept in a bath solution containing 145 mmK+. ASP+ uptake was inhibited under these conditions by 20 ± 5% (n = 15, Fig.3). This finding indicates that the uptake of organic cations across the basolateral membrane of human proximal tubules is indeed electrogenic.Figure 3Dependence of ASP+ uptake on membrane voltage.

All substrates reduced ASP+ uptake in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4). Cimitidine inhibited the ASP+ uptake with an apparent Ki of 11 μm and TEA+ with a Ki of 63 μm. The maximal inhibition of ASP+ uptake reached with these substrates ranged between 56 and 66%. Amiloride (1 mm) reduced the uptake by 38 ± 4% (n= 7), data not shown. Quinine, a type 2 inhibitor of organic cation transport which is at least not transported by rOCT1 (24Nagel G. Volk C. Friedrich T. Ulzheimer J.C. Bamberg E. Koepsell H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31953-31956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), inhibited ASP+ uptake with a Ki of 3 μm. These data indicate that the largest portion of ASP+ uptake across the basolateral membrane of the human proximal tubule is mediated via specific organic cation transporters probably of the OCT type.Figure 4Concentration-dependent inhibition of ASP+ uptake by other organic cations.The substrates cimetidine (●, n = 3–8) and TEA+ (■, n = 3–16) inhibited ASP+ uptake with Ki values of 11 and 63 μm, respectively. The inhibitor quinine (♦,n = 5–10) reduced ASP+ uptake with aKi of 3 μm. Inhibition of ASP+ uptake is shown in % of control mean values ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Regulation of ASP+ UptakeTo investigate the regulation of organic cation transport in these human proximal tubules, the ASP+ uptake rate under resting conditions was compared in paired experiments with that after a 10-min incubation with different activators of protein kinases. As shown in the original recordings of Fig. 5, incubation of the tubule for 10 min with either forskolin (1 μm), DOG (1 μm), or 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm) decreased the activity of organic cation transport. The results of these experiments are summarized in Fig.6. Activation of the adenylate cyclase and consequently PKA via forskolin (1 μm) resulted in an inhibition of ASP+ uptake by 29 ± 3% (n = 10). Stimulation of PKC with DOG (1 μm), the membrane-permeable homolog of diacylglycerol, inhibited ASP+ uptake by 30 ± 3% (n= 16). ATP (10 μm) again stimulating PKC decreased the uptake by 38 ± 13% (n = 6). Incubation of proximal tubules with the membrane-permeable analog of cGMP, 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm) or hANP (10 nm), both activating PKG, led to a decrease in ASP+ uptake of 32 ± 5 (n = 10) and 17 ± 3% (n = 9), respectively. The involvement of PKC in the effect induced by DOG was demonstrated by the combined incubation of the tubules with DOG (1 μm) and the PKC inhibitor calphostin C (0.1 μm). Under these conditions the reduction in ASP+ uptake by DOG alone was significantly reduced by 55 ± 24% (n = 7), data not shown.Figure 5Original recordings of ASP+uptake in human proximal tubules. After 10 min of incubation with forskolin (1 μm) for stimulation of PKA, DOG (1 μm) for stimulation of PKC, or 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm) for stimulation of PKG, ASP+ was given in addition to the agonists. The initial ASP+ uptake is shown for each agonist in comparison to its own paired control which was recorded immediately before the incubation with the respective agonists.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Regulation of organic cation transport in human proximal tubules by various agonists. PKA was stimulated with forskolin (1 μm); PKC was stimulated with DOG (1 μm) and ATP (100 μm), and PKG was stimulated with 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm) and human ANP (10 nm). The last column shows the effects of incubation with ANP, DOG, and forskolin together. The tubules were incubated with the agonists for 10 min. ASP+ uptake was measured in presence of the agonists. Data are shown as mean values ± S.E., numbers in parenthesesindicate number of experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether activation of these different cellular signaling pathways together results in larger effects, tubules were incubated with a mixture of hANP (10 nm), DOG (1 μm), and forskolin (1 μm). In six such experiments the inhibition of ASP+ uptake was not significantly different compared with the effects of each of the agonists added alone (Fig.6).As maximal concentrations of TEA+, cimetidine, or quinine did reduce ASP+ uptake by only 60%, we examined in addition whether the observed inhibition of ASP+ uptake by DOG interferes with this TEA+-sensitive portion or with the TEA+-insensitive portion of ASP+ transport. In 7 such experiments with 5 mm TEA+ present DOG (1 μm) did not significantly influence the remaining ASP+ uptake, data not shown.RT-PCRTo investigate which transporters may be involved in the organic cation transport in human proximal tubules, RT-PCR experiments were performed to detect mRNA of cloned human organic cation transporters. As shown in Fig. 7mRNA specific for hOCT1, hOCT2, hOCTN1, and hOCTN2 was detected in isolated human proximal tubules.Figure 7Detection of mRNA of cloned human organic cation transporters from isolated human proximal tubules by RT-PCR.

As a large number of widely used drugs like antihypertensives, antibiotics, and others belong to these cationic xenobiotics and are substrates for these transporters (7Ullrich K.J. Amidon G.L. Sadée W. Membrane Transporters as Drug Targets. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 159-179Google Scholar), the knowledge of properties of organic cation transport especially in the human proximal tubule is desirable. So far no functional data from the human kidney or the isolated human proximal tubule are available at all. The reported significant differences in properties between the homologous transporters cloned from different species (22Dresser M.J. Gray A.T. Giacomini K.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 1146-1152PubMed Google Scholar), however, indicate that it is not possible to simply extrapolate from findings in animals to the human situation. Furthermore, no data on the mechanisms and signaling pathways of the regulation of the cloned human transporters do exist up to now. As shown for the Na+-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) (36Hirsch J.R. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

Our findings of regulation of the apical organic cation transport in a human (IHKE-1) and a porcine (LLC-PK-1) proximal tubule cell line show again that in different species this transport is not necessarily under regulation of the same kinases (29Hohage H.

We used the fluorescence technique recently established in our laboratory (29Hohage H. Stachon A. Feidt C. Hirsch J.R. Schlatter E. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

This tissue was obtained with fairly high frequency and mechanical isolation of tubules for functional experiments was possible within 1 h under controlled cooling and oxygenation conditions. Experiments could be done successfully with these tubules for several hours.Here we present the first measurements of organic cation transport in the human proximal tubule, identifying its electrogeneity, substrate specificity, and regulation by PKA, PKC, and PKG. As the isolated tubules were collapsed and their ends were fixed in two holding pipettes, uptake of ASP+ was restricted to transport processes across the basolateral membrane. ASP+ uptake was concentration-dependent between 5 nm and 100 μm but did not reach saturation at 100 μmwhich was the highest concentration that could be dissolved in aqueous solution. These findings indicate that the Km for ASP+ for this preparation is comparable to that determined for ASP+ uptake across the contraluminal side of rat proximal tubules in vivo (280 μm) (37Pietruck F. Ullrich K.J. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1647-1657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Alternatively, this concentration response curve extending over more than 3 decades points to the existence of two components responsible for ASP+ accumulation in the human proximal tubule as follows: a high affinity transport system with a Km for ASP+ similar to that determined by us with the same method or with tracer flux measurements for the cloned rOCT1 expressed in HEK293 cells (around 1 μm) (28Mehrens T.

KS lesions are composed of infiltrating inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, and fusiform or spindle-shaped cells; the origin of spindle cells is controversial but they may be derived from endothelial cells. KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV; human herpesvirus type 8) is a γ2-herpesvirus that is likely to be the etiological agent of KS (1Ganem D. Curr. Clin. Top. Infect.

This virus is present in primary effusion lymphomas and in a subset of cases of multicentric Castleman's disease. The pathogenic mechanisms by which infection with KSHV leads to disease are still unclear. Among several potential oncogenes present in its genome, a chemokine-like G protein-coupled receptor, KSHV-GPCR, is a strong candidate to explain KS-mediated pathogenesis. This GPCR exhibits basal signaling (constitutive activity) through the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C-InsP pathway in human embryonic kidney and monkey kidney (COS-1) cells (5Arvanitakis L.

More recently, transgenic mice expressing KSHV-GPCR under the control of the CD2 promoter/enhancer were reported to develop highly vascularized KS-like tumors, further supporting the contribution of this GPCR to the pathogenesis of KS (12Yang T.-Y.

Since GPCRs in general, and chemokine GPCRs in particular, may exhibit different signaling properties in different cell types, we investigated KSHV-GPCR coupling and signaling in endothelial cells. We chose endothelial cells because they are likely targets of KSHV infection. The present study characterizes KSHV-GPCR signaling in endothelial cells stably expressing this receptor. We found, as in other cell types, that KSHV-GPCR signals in endothelial cells through a PTX-insensitive, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C pathway. We show, for the first time, that in endothelial cells KSHV-GPCR signals also through a separate PTX-sensitive pathway that leads to regulation of intracellular cAMP levels. Last, we confirm that KSHV-GPCR couples to PI3K and to G protein βγ subunit (Gβγ)-mediated activation of NF-κB. Microvascular endothelial cells were obtained from lungs of newborn mice carrying an immortalizing transgene composed of DNA for the SV40 large T antigen under the control of regulatory elements of the human vimentin gene (13Vicart P.

Endothelial cells were isolated from minced lung tissue after collagenase digestion and Percoll gradient separation of endothelial cells from other cell types, followed by a differential adhesion procedure to remove residual fibroblasts (14Lodge P.A. Haisch C.E. Thomas F.T. Transplant. Proc. 1992; 24: 2816-2817PubMed Google Scholar). MLECs grew as a monolayer on a gelatin-coated surface, demonstrated contact inhibition at confluence, and were positive for Von Willebrands' antigen. Proliferation in culture was stimulated by low concentrations of fetal bovine serum (1–5%) and no supplemental growth factors were required. Presence of the transgene renders these endothelial cells immortal. MLECs were maintained in DMEM with 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). All tissue culture dishes were coated with 0.2% gelatin. MLECs were transfected with either the pcDNA 3.1-KSHV-GPCR (“clone”), pCEFL-KSHV-GPCR (“pool”), or “empty” plasmid (“mock”) (5Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) using Lipofectin reagent according to the manufacturers recommendations (Life Technologies, Inc.). MLECs (1 × 106) were incubated with 2 μg/ml plasmid in serum-free medium. After 5 h, medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 600 μg/ml active G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) were added to the cells. In order to obtain clonal transfectants, selected neomycin plates were split to obtain isolated colonies. The clones and pools (containing multiple clones) were screened for KSHV-GPCR expression by measuring specific binding with radiolabeled growth-related oncogene α (Groα), a ligand for KSHV-GPCR (15Rosenkilde M.M.

One pool and one clone expressing KSHV-GPCRs (MLEC/KSHV-GPCR), and one pool transfected with empty plasmid (MLEC/mock) were chosen for further studies. Stable transfectants were maintained in G418 and passaged before attaining confluence. Approximately 70,000 cells were seeded per well in 24-well plates in DMEM with 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4.125I-Groα (10 pm, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of unlabeled Groα were added in ice-cold HBSS supplemented with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), bacitracin (1 mg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Plates were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with gentle rocking. Assays were terminated by aspirating the binding buffer, washing the cell monolayers three times with chilled HBSS containing 0.5 m NaCl, and solubilizing the cells with 0.4 m NaOH. An aliquot of this solution was counted in a γ-counter and data were expressed as a percentage of maximum125I-Groα bound. Binding and dose-response curves were analyzed using Prism software (Graphpad). Approximately 35,000 cells were seeded per well in 24-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 1% fetal calf serum and 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and maintained in culture for an additional 24 h. After removing the culture medium, the cells were washed with HBSS containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and incubated in HBSS containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 10 mm LiCl in the absence or presence of human recombinant Groα and interferon-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10, R&D Systems). Cells were collected after 90 min and accumulated InsPs measured using ion-exchange chromatography. Basal InsP accumulation during 90 min was calculated as the difference between InsP levels in cells incubated with and without LiCl. InsP accumulation was calculated as [3H]InsP/([3H]lipids + [3H]InsP). Approximately 35,000 MLEC/mock and MLEC/KSHV-GPCRs cells were seeded per well in 24-well plates in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were transiently transfected the next day with 1.2 μg/ml pNF-κB-Luc plasmid cis-reporting system (Stratagene), using a LipofectAMINE transfection protocol according to the manufacturers recommendations (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total plasmid DNA was kept constant. To gain more insights into the role played by βγ subunits, cells were co-transfected with 1.8 μg/ml Gα transducin and 1.2 μg/ml pNF-κB-Luc plasmidcis-reporting system. Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated with or without PTX (1 μg/ml, Calbiochem) for 4 h before adding Groα (100 nm) or IP-10 (100 nm) for 24 h; no chemokines were added to wells used to evaluate basal signaling. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.8). Cell lysates were diluted 1:7 in reaction buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mmKH2PO4, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.8), then combined with equal volumes of 0.4 mm luciferin in reaction buffer, and luminescence was measured for 10 s. Approximately 35,000 cells were seeded per well in 24-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The next day, medium was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM containing 1% fetal calf serum. After an additional 24 h, cAMP production was measured as the level of cAMP accumulated over 45 min in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine. In brief, cells were washed once with HBSS and then incubated in HBSS containing 0.5 mmisobutylmethylxanthine without (basal) or with 10 μmforskolin, forskolin and Groα (100 nm), or forskolin and IP-10 (100 nm) for 45 min at 37 °C. The same conditions were used with cells pretreated with PTX (1 μg/ml for 4 h). At the end of the incubation, cells were washed with HBSS, lysed with 1 ml chloroform (42): methanol (36): water (22Chang Y. Cesarman E. Pessin M.S. Lee F. Culpepper J. Knowles D.M. Moore P.S. Science. 1994; 266: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (4952) Google Scholar) and the phases separated. The methanol/water phase was dried and the cAMP acetylated with a mixture of triethylamine/acetic anhydride (2:1). cAMP levels were assayed by radioimmunoassay using a specific rabbit anti-acetylated cAMP IgG (Calbiochem) diluted 1:20,000 as primary antibody. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 3% normal rabbit serum (Arnel) in the presence of 2 fmol of 125I-cAMP (Biomedical Technologies, Inc.) and then with an anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody (Arnel) for 4 h. Precipitates were washed with ice-cold buffer (50 mm Na acetate, pH 6.2) and air-dried. Radioactivity was counted and cAMP levels were determined using a standard curve (Graphpad PRISM with non-linear regression); the linear range was between 0.5 and 100 fmol. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were seeded in 35-mm diameter dishes in DMEM supplemented with 5% of fetal calf serum. After 24 h, the medium was changed to 1% fetal calf serum for another 24 h. Cells were incubated with or without 10 μm forskolin for 45 min and then rinsed briefly twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested on ice in 200 μl of a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Cells were then scraped and total lysates were incubated end over end at 4 °C for 30 min. An aliquot of 15 μl of this lysate was used to assess PI4K activity separately. For PI3K assays, samples were spun down at 500 ×g 15 min at 4 °C and clear lysates were then incubated with 5 μg of PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 1 h with gentle agitation at 4 °C. After this step, 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added to samples for 30 min with gentle agitation at 4 °C. Complexes formed with protein A were washed once with lysis buffer and twice with a kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors. For both lipid kinase assays, samples were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μg of phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) and incubated 10 min at room temperature before adding 0.02m MgCl2 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for another 10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 100 μl of 1 n HCl. Phosphatidylinositol phosphates were extracted with 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). The chloroform phase was blown completely to dryness before spotting onto thin-layer chromatography plates (Whatman LK6D) in 30 μl of chloroform. Plates were pretreated with 1.2% potassium oxalate and samples run in a solvent system of chloroform (70): acetone (20Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Biomembr. 1990; 1031: 163-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar): methanol (50): acetic acid (20Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev.

Biomembr. 1990; 1031: 163-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Plates were exposed to film for 12 h before development. Since endothelial cells appear to be targets for KSHV infection, we focused on KSHV-GPCR coupling and signaling in MLECs expressing these receptors stably. Our previous studies of KSHV-GPCRs in model cells showed that KSHV-GPCR signals through the InsP pathway via a PTX-insensitive pathway. However, GPCRs may exhibit different signaling properties depending on the cell type in which they are expressed. For example, Montaner et al. (see “Discussion”) recently reported that KSHV-GPCR couples to the activation of Akt/protein kinase B via a PTX-sensitive pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (17Montaner S. Sodhi A. Pece S. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2641-2648PubMed Google Scholar). We established stable MLECs expressing KSHV-GPCRs and chose to study both a high expressing clone and a pool of G418-resistant cells so as to ensure that the findings were not artifacts of a single clonal phenotype. Binding using 125I-Groα was performed to select these cell populations. As shown in Fig.1 A, specific125I-Groα binding was observed in the clone and the pool of cells expressing KSHV-GPCRs, whereas there was no specific binding in MLEC/mock. The calculated number of receptors expressed at the cell surface was higher for the clone compared with the pool, 112,000 sites per cell versus 82,000 sites per cell, respectively. We found that the affinity of labeled Groα for the receptor in both cell populations was similar to that found previously (inhibitory constant of ∼0.2 nm) in other cell types (18Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Ho H. Clark-Lewis I. Gershengorn M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Geras-Raaka E. Arvanitakis L. Bais C. Cesarman E. Mesri E.A. Gershengorn M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We tested KSHV-GPCR signaling via the InsP pathway in these cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, there was no measurable production of InsPs in MLEC/mock under basal conditions nor when cells were incubated with Groα. In contrast to findings in other cell types (5Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 15Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we were unable to detect agonist-independent InsP production in either population of KSHV-GPCR-expressing MLECs. However, InsP production was increased in response to Groα in both MLEC-KSHV-GPCR/pool and MLEC-KSHV-GPCR/clone with a greater increase in the clonal cells. We also tested the inhibition of Groα-stimulated InsP production by IP-10, which was shown previously to be an inverse agonist for KSHV-GPCR (18Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Ho H. Clark-Lewis I. Gershengorn M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 1 C show that IP-10 inhibited Groα-stimulated InsP production in the MLEC/KSHV-GPCR/clone with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 1.4 nm. Similar results were obtained with the MLEC/KSHV-GPCR/pool (data not shown). Thus, KSHV-GPCR expressed in MLECs displayed pharmacological characteristics, namely Groα as an agonist and IP-10 as an antagonist, consistent with those reported previously in other cell systems. There was no evidence of basal (or agonist-independent) InsP production in MLECs expressing KSHV-GPCRs. To gain insight into which G protein(s) couple(s) KSHV-GPCR to the InsP pathway in endothelial cells, we studied the effect of PTX. In all other cell types studied, KSHV-GPCR stimulation of InsP production was not affected by PTX treatment and it was concluded that KSHV-GPCR may couple to a member of the Gq subfamily of G proteins because coupling to Gi/o would be inhibited by PTX (5Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 7Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). However, in the MLEC/KSHV-GPCR/clone, we unexpectedly found that PTX pretreatment increased InsP production stimulated by Groα (Fig. 2). Similar results were found for MLEC/KSHV-GPCR/pool (data not shown). Since we did not find that PTX inhibited Groα-stimulated InsP production, we concluded that phosphoinositide hydrolysis was not mediated by Gi/o. It was possible, however, that the enhancing effect of PTX pretreatment on InsP production stimulated via KSHV-GPCRs was secondary to an increase in cellular cAMP since PTX would uncouple inhibition of adenylyl cyclase caused by Gi/o. We, therefore, measured the effect of PTX pretreatment on cAMP production in these cells. As shown in Fig. 3, PTX had no effect on cAMP production in MLEC/mock. In contrast, cAMP levels were increased by PTX in both MLEC/KSHV-GPCR/pool and MLEC/KSHV-GPCR/clone. It was possible, therefore, that the effect of PTX to enhance KSHV-GPCR-stimulated InsP production was caused by increased cAMP. To test this hypothesis, we measured Groα stimulation of InsP production in KSHV-GPCR-expressing cells incubated with forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase that elevates cAMP levels in these cells (see below). Fig. 4 illustrates that forskolin treatment of the cells had no effect on Groα-stimulated InsP production in the MLEC/KSHV-GPCR/clone. Similar results were observed in MLEC/KSHV-GPCR/pool (data not shown). Therefore, cAMP was not the mediator by which PTX increased InsP production via KSHV-GPCR.Figure 3Effect of PTX on basal cAMP production in MLEC/mock and MLEC/KSHV-GPCR/clone cells.

The data represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations in one representative experiment out of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because PTX acts to uncouple GPCRs from activating Gαi/o, the observation that PTX increased cAMP production in KSHV-GPCR-expressing endothelial cells (Fig. 3) is consistent with the idea that chronic inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity may occur by a receptor-mediated mechanism in MLEC-KSHV-GPCRs. However, the identity of the responsible receptor was not clear. To determine whether the persistent inhibition of cAMP production resulted from KSHV-GPCR signaling, we studied the effects of Groα and IP-10 on forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in MLEC/KSHV-GPCRs (Fig.5 A). The data show that Groα, an agonist of KSHV-GPCR, lowered cAMP levels whereas IP-10, a negative antagonist (inverse agonist) of KSHV-GPCR, increased cAMP levels. These data offer pharmacological evidence that basal and Groα-stimulated KSHV-GPCR signaling inhibits cAMP production and, moreover, are consistent with the idea that KSHV-GPCR couples to Gi/o in these endothelial cells. To support this idea further, we measured the effects of PTX on Groα lowering of forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. As shown in Fig.5 B, the Groα inhibitory effect in MLEC/KSHV-GPCR/pool was partially prevented by PTX treatment. Similar results were obtained with MLEC/KSHV-GPCR/clone (data not shown). Neither PTX nor Groα altered forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in MLEC/mock cells (data not shown). Thus, Groα inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production by KSHV-GPCR occurs via coupling to PTX-sensitive Gi/o. Although our data are consistent with the idea that KSHV-GPCR regulates InsP and cAMP levels independently and that cAMP did not affect InsP levels, it was possible that there was another signaling pathway used by KSHV-GPCR that was regulated by cAMP. As it was recently shown that an inhibitor of PI3K affects KSHV-GPCR signaling in human endothelial cells (17Montaner S. Sodhi A. Pece S. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2641-2648PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether cAMP affected the PI3K pathway in MLECs. To test this hypothesis directly, we measured the effects of forskolin on PI3K activities in MLEC/KSHV-GPCRs and MLEC/mocks. As predicted, MLEC/KSHV-GPCR cells exhibited increased PI3K activity compared with MLEC/mock cells (Fig. 6 A). This increase in lipid kinase activity was specific because there was no difference in the activities of PI4K, a related enzyme that is present at higher levels but which is not as tightly regulated as PI3K, in MLEC/KSHV-GPCR and MLEC/mock cells (Fig. 6 A). PTX did not affect PI3K activity (data not shown). Furthermore, as shown in Fig.6 B, forskolin treatment did not affect PI3K activity in either cell line. These data showed that changes in cAMP levels did not affect PI3K activity. Therefore, cAMP does not appear to mediate KSHV-GPCR effects on either InsP production or PI3K activity. With mammalian chemokine GPCRs, which couple to Gi/oproteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, Gβ may also serve as an effector (20Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Biomembr. 1990; 1031: 163-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). To determine whether Gi may mediate signaling after activation of KSHV-GPCR, we measured the effects of KSHV-GPCR signaling on activation of NF-κB activity, which may be stimulated by Gβ (21Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Fig. 7illustrates NF-κB activity in MLEC/KSHV-GPCRs. To determine if NF-κB was activated specifically by KSHV-GPCR, we measured the effect of Groα stimulation, using two different concentrations (10 nm, which is half-maximally effective, and 100 nm, which near-maximally effective) and the effect of IP-10 (Fig. 7, NF-κB bars). NFκB activity was increased 2-fold over basal by 100 nm Gro-α and by 1.4-fold by 10 nm Groα. No change in NF-κB activity was observed in MLEC/mock in any condition investigated (data not shown). IP-10 lowered NF-κB activity by 20% thereby providing evidence of basal signaling of the receptor in these cells via a NF-κB-mediated pathway. To gain insight into the mechanism of KSHV-GPCR activation of NF-κβ, we assessed the effects of PTX treatment (Fig. 7,NF-κB + PTX bars). PTX inhibited Groα-stimulated NF-κB activity and abrogated the inhibition caused by IP-10. Therefore, KSHV-GPCR regulation of NF-κB activity appeared to be mediated by Gi/o. To determine whether the specific mediator was Gαi/o or Gβγ, we transfected MLEC-KSHV-GPCR cells with Gα transducin, which acts as a scavenger to sequester released Gβγ and would prevent released Gβγ from activating NF-κB. As shown in Fig. 7 (NF-κB +GαT bars), Gα transducin expression in MLEC-KSHV-GPCR cells inhibited NF-κB activation. This inhibition was comparable to that induced by PTX treatment alone. With 100 nm Groα, PTX and Gα transducin expression inhibited NF-κB activation to similar extents (by 65 to 70%). We also exposed cells expressing Gα transducin to PTX (Fig. 7,NF-κB + GαT + PTX bars) and observed that the inhibition of Groα stimulation of NF-κB appeared to be additive. However, although the effects of PTX and expression of Gα transducin appeared to be additive, to be certain that a Gβγ-independent mechanism was involved it would be necessary to ensure that both PTX and Gα transducin were maximally effective under the experimental conditions used. These data provide evidence that KSHV-GPCR couples to PTX-sensitive Gi/o protein leading to activation of NF-κB primarily by Gβγ subunits. Seven years after its discovery (22Chang Y. Cesarman E. Pessin M.S. Lee F. Culpepper J. Knowles D.M. Moore P.S. Science. 1994; 266: 1865-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (4952) Google Scholar), a consensus has developed that KSHV is the etiological agent of KS. The virus is consistently found in KS lesions, and is located principally in microvascular endothelial cells and the spindle tumor cells (KS cells) (11Sturzl M. Blasig C. Schreier A. Neipel F. Hohenadl C. Cornali E. Ascherl G. Esser S. Brockmeyer N.H. Ekman M. Kaaya E.E. Tschachler E. Biberfeld P. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Boshoff C.

KSHV belongs to a family of transforming viruses and is believed to contain more potential oncogenes in its genome than the other members. Among these transforming genes, ORF 74 encoding a G protein-coupled receptor has been shown to be a good candidate to explain KS pathogenesis, at least in part (25Cesarman E. Mesri E.A. Gershengorn M.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although it has not been proved that KSHV-GPCRs are expressed in KS lesions in a functional form, evidence has been provided that expression of signaling KSHV-GPCRs can lead to tumorigenesis in models in which cells expressing KSHV-GPCRs are transplanted into mice (7Bais C. Santomasso B. Coso O. Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Gutkind J.S. Asch A.S. Cesarman E. Gershengorn M.C. Mesri E.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) and in transgenic mice expressing KSHV-GPCR under the control of CD2 promoter/enhancer (12Yang T.-Y. Chen S.-C. Leach M.W. Manfra D. Homey B. Wiekowski M. Sullivan L. Jenh C.-H. Narula S.K. Chensue S.W. Lira S.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These tumors are angioproliferative lesions resembling KS, including features of KS-like spindle cells. Since KS-spindle cells are believed to be of endothelial origin, and are target cells for the virus, we developed anin vitro model in which KSHV-GPCR is stably expressed in mouse lung endothelial cells and tested receptor function in these transfected endothelial cells. Until recently, studies of KSHV-GPCR signaling have been conducted with rat fibroblasts, monkey kidney cells, and human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. These cell types, although very useful, give only a limited picture of KSHV-GPCR biology. A report published as our studies were being completed described effects of transient expression of KSHV-GPCRs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (17Montaner S. Sodhi A. Pece S. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2641-2648PubMed Google Scholar) (see below). KSHV-GPCR was previously shown to exhibit high ligand-independent signaling via a PTX-insensitive phospholipase C pathway (5Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 15Rosenkilde M.M. Kledal T.N. Bräuner-Osborne H. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Since signaling properties of GPCRs may differ in different cell types, we analyzed KSHV-GPCR signaling in mouse lung endothelial cells. We constructed cell lines stably expressing KSHV-GPCRs so as to be able to measure endogenous signaling cascades in cell populations. KSHV-GPCRs expressed stably in MLECs exhibited the same binding characteristics reported previously in several cell types (Fig. 1) and signaled through a phospholipase C pathway that was not inhibited by PTX (see below). However, we observed that although Groα stimulated increased InsP production and Groα-stimulated InsP production was inhibited by IP-10, as reported in other cell types (5Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 18Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Ho H. Clark-Lewis I. Gershengorn M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), there was no measurable basal signaling via this pathway in MLECs expressing KSHV-GPCRs. This first major difference compared with previous reports led us to look for basal signaling activity by KSHV-GPCR via other pathways. Indeed, we provide strong evidence that in endothelial cells KSHV-GPCR constitutively inhibits cAMP production and lowers basal cellular cAMP levels. This conclusion is most directly supported by the findings that the KSHV-GPCR-specific inverse agonist IP-10 increases cAMP levels in MLEC/KSHV-GPCR cells (Fig. 5 A). In previous reports, it was concluded that KSHV-GPCR signaling was coupled only to a Gqprotein family member since InsP production was not affected by PTX treatment. In our study, we showed that KSHV-GPCR couples to a PTX-sensitive Gi/o protein that causes lowering of cAMP levels and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, a common pleiotropic mediator involved in many biological processes including oncogenesis, control of apoptosis, differentiation, and cell migration. These effects of KSHV-GPCR on cAMP have not been previously reported but are similar to the signaling effects of mammalian chemokine receptors (26Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar). As noted above, Montaner and colleagues (17Montaner S. Sodhi A. Pece S. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2641-2648PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported on their studies of KSHV-GPCR signaling in endothelial cells. In contrast to our use of mouse endothelial cells stably expressing KSHV-GPCRs, they used human umbilical vein endothelial cells that transiently expressed KSHV-GPCRs. Montaner et al. (17Montaner S. Sodhi A. Pece S. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2641-2648PubMed Google Scholar) found that KSHV-GPCR expression caused an increase in cell survival that was mediated by Akt/protein kinase B and deduced that KSHV-GPCR activated PI3K because wortmannin inhibited activation of exogenously expressed Akt. We confirmed their finding that KSHV-GPCR increases survival of endothelial cells (data not shown) and showed that KSHV-GPCR signals through the PI3K/Akt pathway by measuring endogenous PI3K activity directly. In addition, we studied whether cAMP might mediate the effects of KSHV-GPCR on PI3K activity. We found that increases in intracellular cAMP stimulated with forskolin had no effect on PI3K activity. Thus, neither the increase in PI3K activity nor in the production of InsP second messengers stimulated by KSHV-GPCR is mediated by cAMP. Both our study and that of Montaner et al.(17Montaner S. Sodhi A. Pece S. Mesri E.A. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2641-2648PubMed Google Scholar) show that in endothelial cells KSHV-GPCR activates the transcription factor NF-κB, signals via PTX-sensitive as well as PTX-insensitive pathways, and that some of the effects of KSHV-GPCR are mediated by Gβγ subunits. Thus, it may be concluded that KSHV-GPCR signals through several independent pathways in endothelial cells and that there are likely to be many diverse biological effects associated with expression of KSHV-GPCRs in these cells. An unexpected finding was that PTX treatment enhanced Groα-stimulated InsP production in MLEC-KSHV-GPCR cells. This observation was unexpected because in other cells PTX had no effect on KSHV-GPCR-stimulated InsP production and for several GPCRs, including mammalian chemokine receptors (26Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2259) Google Scholar), PTX diminishes InsP production because these receptors are coupled to activation of phospholipase C by Gi/o proteins. It appears, therefore, that in MLECs, as in other cell types, KSHV-GPCR stimulation of InsP production is primarily mediated by Gq family members. The mechanism whereby PTX led to an increase in KSHV-GPCR-stimulated InsP production remains unclear. We tested the possibility that the increase in cAMP caused by PTX (Fig. 3) could increase the activity of the phospholipase C that causes hydrolysis of phosphoinositides. However, our data show that increased Groα-stimulated InsP production after PTX treatment was not a response to increased cAMP because elevating cAMP directly with forskolin did not affect InsP production. Another possibility was that PTX uncoupled a receptor that inhibits InsP production. However, no GPCR has been identified that directly couples via a G protein to inhibit phospholipase C, as GPCRs couple via Gi proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase (20Birnbaumer L. Abramowitz J. Brown A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Biomembr. 1990; 1031: 163-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Some GPCRs that couple via PTX-sensitive G proteins, such as receptors for somatostatin and dopamine, have been found indirectly to inhibit phospholipase C activity by causing a lowering of cytoplasmic free calcium ion concentration (27Koch B.D. Dorflinger L.J. Schonbrunn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13138-13145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it is possible that this occurred in KSHV-GPCR-expressing MLECs. Indeed, it remains possible that KSHV-GPCR could lower cytoplasmic calcium ion concentration via coupling to Gi/o proteins and that PTX reversed this effect on calcium thus permitting increased phospholipase C activity and increased phosphoinositide hydrolysis. This possibility could be tested in future studies. In conclusion, this study shows that KSHV-GPCRs couple to multiple pathways in endothelial cells including the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP pathway. These findings confirm and extend previous observations that both PTX-sensitive and PTX-insensitive pathways are involved in KSHV-GPCR signaling and that both Gα and Gβγ subunits serve as effectors for KSHV-GPCR signaling. These findings are consistent with the concept that KSHV-GPCR may regulate diverse processes in endothelial cells that are important for KS viral survival and that may lead to human disease. We are grateful to Professor Denise Paulin, University of Paris 7, for the gift of the transgenic mice carrying an immortalizing transgene developed in her laboratory, from which the mouse lung endothelial cells were derived."

Many of these peptides are pharmacologically important drugs like the immunosuppressive cyclosporin A or the antibiotics penicillin, vancomycin, and bacitracin. Other nonribosomally synthesized peptides like siderophores are associated with pathogenicity of microorganisms. The extraordinary variety of biological properties is a result of the enormous structural diversity in this group of natural products. A vast set of substrates like amino acids and hydroxyl as well as carboxylic compounds are known to be incorporated into the peptide chain. In addition, the assembled residues can be further modified by epimerization, N-methylation, acylation, glycosylation, or heterocyclization. The final products display linear, cyclic, and/or branched peptide backbones (1Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 2Doekel S. Marahiel M.A. Metab. Eng. 2001; 6: 64-77Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nonribosomal peptide assembly is catalyzed by large multifunctional nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs).1 Sequencing of several genes encoding NRPSs combined with recent biochemical and structural studies revealed a universal modular scaffold for these enzymes. Each module represents a functional unit including a full complement of active sites for recognition, activation, and incorporation of one constituent into the product. According to the multiple thiotemplate mechanism (3Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), in the first step, the adenylation (A)-domain recognizes and activates the cognate substrate by ATP hydrolysis to the corresponding adenylate. Subsequently, the activated substrate is covalently linked onto the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl (4′-PPan) cofactor, which is attached to an invariant serine residue of the peptidyl carrier protein domain (PCP), that is located downstream of the A-domain. Posttranslational modification of the PCP-domain is catalyzed by a 4′-PPan-transferase (PPTase) (4Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Normally, genes encoding PPTases are associated with most NRPS biosynthetic gene clusters. During the elongation reaction the PCP-tethered precursors are coupled to the nascent peptide chain by the condensation (C)-domain, which is located between each consecutive pair of activating units. In addition to the A-, PCP-, and C-domains, modifying domains are found in modules that incorporate modified residues. Final release of the full-length peptide chain by cyclization or hydrolysis is catalyzed by a thioesterase-like (Te)-domain residing at the COOH terminus of the last NRPS. As a consequence of these assembly line mechanisms, the primary sequence and the extent of modification of the final NRPSs product are controlled by a linear sequence of catalytic domains and modules (2Doekel S. Marahiel M.A. Metab. Eng. 2001; 6: 64-77Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 5Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Konz D.

Based on the modular arrangement of NRPSs, engineered manipulation of the nonribosomal protein templates enabled the rational design of new peptide products.

Furthermore, truncated lipopeptide derivatives could be producedin vivo by moving the carboxyl-terminal intrinsic Te-domain (12de Ferra F. Rodriguez F. Tortora O. Tosi C. Grandi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25304-25309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) downstream of the internal PCP-domains of the srfAbiosynthesis operon. The cyclic branched peptide antibiotic bacitracin is produced byBacillus licheniformis ATCC 10716, a strain that lacks natural competence. Genetic manipulations of the bacitracin biosynthesis operon have therefore so far been difficult to realize. However, the structural properties of the branched cyclic, thiazoline ring-containing peptide make bacitracin a desirable task to employ the genetic engineering strategies devised for NRPSs (13Stachelhaus T. Schneider A. Marahiel M.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed a heterologous expression system for the entire 49 kb comprising bacitracin biosynthesis operon (bac) in the genetically accessible surrogate host B. subtilis. The 26 kb comprising surfactin biosynthesis operon was deleted from the chromosome of B. subtilis, and the bac operon was integrated stepwise at the same chromosomal location by homologous recombination. Heterologous expression of the bacitracin biosynthesis gene cluster in the surrogate host B. subtilis revealed the production of the three NRPSs BacABC in a functional and posttranslational modified holo-form and expression of the bacitracinself-resistance genes. Furthermore, the heterologousB. subtilis host revealed an elevated bacitracin production compared with the wild type producer B. licheniformis ATCC 10716.

The corresponding strains of B. subtilis were transformed by treatment with 10 ng of linearized plasmid or chromosomal DNA at an optical density ofA600 0.55 as described by Klein et al. (43Klein C. Kaletta C. Schnell N. Entian K.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 132-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and plated on Difco Sporulation solid medium supplemented with an appropriate amount of antibiotic for selection. Loss or gain of antibiotic resistance were verified by replica plating. Transformation of B. subtilis TS30 (9Stachelhaus T. Schneider A. Marahiel M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) with thesrfA deletion plasmid pKE19 resulted in B. subtilis strain KE10 with the phenotype MLSS and CmR (see Fig. 2). Transformation of the B. subtilis srfA deletion strain KE10 with the integration plasmid pKE27 resulted in B. subtilis strain KE30 with the phenotype CmR and MLSR, harboring a second copy ofcomS within the amyE site. B. subtilis KE30 was transformed with the plasmid pKE64 to give strain B. subtilis KE300 with the phenotype CmR, KmR, and MLSS. Transformation of B. subtilis KE300 with the plasmid pKE78 resulted inB. subtilis KE310 with the phenotype CmR, MLSR, and KmS (see Fig. 3). Thereby, the 5′ homologous region of bacA was extended from 1 kb (KE300) to 3.1 kb (KE310). Chromosomal DNA of B. licheniformis AK1 (21Konz D. Klens A. Schorgendorfer K. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 927-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) was transformed into B. subtilis KE310, resulting in thebacA expression strain B. subtilis KE320 with the phenotype CmR, KmR, and MLSS (see Fig. 3). Transformation of B. subtilis KE320 with the plasmid pKE110 resulted in B. subtilis KE340 with the phenotype CmR, MLSR, and KmS (see Fig. 5). Chromosomal DNA of B. licheniformis AK20 (22Neumüller A.M. Konz D. Marahiel M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3180-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was transformed in B. subtilis KE340, resulting in B. subtilis strain KE350 with the phenotype CmR, KmR, and MLSS, harboring the entirebacRS disrupted bac operon (see Fig. 5). In the congression experiment, B. subtilis KE350 was transformed with chromosomal DNA of B. licheniformis ATCC 10716 together with the self-replicable helper plasmid pCm::Tc, resulting in B. subtilis strain KE355 with the phenotype CmR, TcR, and KmS (see Fig. 6). After loss of the plasmid pCm::Tc (25Steinmetz M. Richter R. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 142: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), B. subtilis KE360 with the phenotype CmR, TcS, and KmS could be obtained, harboring bacTABCRS and bcrABC within the former srfA locus (see Fig. 6). A prewarmed 400-ml volume of 2× YT medium was inoculated 1/100 with an overnight culture of the corresponding Bacillus strain and allowed to grow at 37 °C under aerobic conditions. Cells were harvested 2 h after entry into the stationary growth phase. Cells were resuspended in 5 ml of sucrose buffer A (20% sucrose, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithioerythritol, lysozyme 1 mg/ml pH 7.8) and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. Protoplasts were broken by three passages through a French pressure cell (Amicon). The supernatant was separated by centrifugation and subjected to a 35–55% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. All following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 2 ml of sucrose buffer B (10% sucrose, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithioerythritol, pH 8.0). The solution was applied to a 16/75 Sephacryl™ S-500 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) previously equilibrated with sucrose buffer B. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Elution was performed isocratically. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were identified by SDS-PAGE and subsequently pooled. In order to test the activity to form aminoacyl adenylates, the amino acid-dependent ATP-PPi exchange reaction was performed as described previously with minor modifications (44Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contains 140 μl (∼400 nm) of protein solution, 1 mm amino acid, 1 mm dATP, 50 μm PPi and 20 mmMgCl2 in sucrose buffer B. Exchange was initiated by the addition of 0.15 μCi of sodium [32P]pyrophosphate in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Thioester formation to detect covalently tethered amino acids and the degree of holo enzyme formation was carried out as described previously with minor modifications (44Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contains 180 μl (∼500 nm) of protein solution, 1 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, and radiolabeled amino acid (purchased from Hartmann, Braunschweig, Germany; 3.4 μml-[14C]leucine (292 Ci/mol), 7.6 μml-[14C]isoleucine (260 Ci/mol), or 4.0 μml-[14C]proline (246 Ci/mol), respectively) in sucrose buffer B. The lipopeptide surfactin (see Fig. 1) was extracted as described previously (10Schneider A. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 257: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The hemolytic activity of surfactin was analyzed using blood-agar plates (39Nakano M.M. Marahiel M.A. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5662-5668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were analyzed by HPLC/MS (Hewlett Packard 1100 Series, CC250/3 Nucleosil 120–3C8 column, Macherey & Nagel, Düren, Germany) and monitored at 214 nm as well as in negative-ion mode over the m/z range from 900 to 1200. The following gradient profile was used at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1: applying sample at 70% buffer B, performing a linear gradient to 100% buffer B in 30 min (buffer A, 0.05% formic acid in H2O; buffer B, 0.045% formic acid in methanol). Bacitracin was prepared as described previously using 2× YT medium instead of M20 medium (22Neumüller A.M. Konz D. Marahiel M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3180-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The activity of the extracts were analyzed by the use of freshly prepared Micrococcus luteus plates (45Rieder H. Heinrich G. Breuker E. Simlot M.M. Pfaender P. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 548-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After incubation overnight at 37 °C, M. luteus growth inhibition zones were measured and compared with each other. The extracts were further analyzed by HPLC/MS (Hewlett Packard 1100 Series, Sephasil TM C18 column (5 μm; 250 × 4 mm;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)) monitored at 214 and 253 nm. Scans were taken in positive-ion mode over the m/z range from 600 to 1600. The following gradient profile was used at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min−1: applying sample at 25% buffer B, performing a linear gradient to 50% buffer B in 60 min, following a linear gradient to 100% buffer B in 5 min (buffer A, 0.01% trifluoric acid in H2O; buffer B, acetonitrile). Here, we report the construction of a heterologous expression strain derived from the genetically accessible surfactin producer B. subtilis ATCC 21332 (14Cooper D.G. Macdonald C.R. Duff S.J.B. Kosaric N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1981; 42: 408-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the instability of plasmids containing large insertions of foreign DNA in B. subtilis (15Bron S. Meijer W. Holsappel S. Haima P. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 875-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Ehrlich S.D. Noirot P. Tetit M.A. Jannière L. Michel B. te Riele H. Genet. Eng. 1986; 8: 71-83Crossref Google Scholar), expression of giant recombinant gene clusters like those coding for NRPSs can only be achieved by a stable chromosomal integration. To avoid the expansion of the B. subtilis chromosome by integration of NRPSs biosynthesis gene clusters of enormous size, we have first deleted the resident 26 kb spanning surfactin biosynthesis operon (srfA) (see Fig. 1) by a single homologous recombination event. The deletion of thesrfA operon also led to the deletion of a small competence regulator gene designated comS residing in a different reading frame within the first module of srfA-B (see Fig.1), which is indispensable for the development of native competence inB. subtilis (17Turgay K. Hamoen L.W. Venema G. Dubnau D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 18Ogura M. Liu L. LaCelle M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 799-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For the construction of the srfA deletion plasmid pKE19, the upstream homologous region of srfA (2.5 kb) containingsrfA operator, promoter, and RBS was cloned (see Fig.2). To obtain a B. subtilis srfA deletion strain that still maintains its genetic competence, the transcriptional control of comS (138 bp) was restored by fusion to the RBS of the srfA promotor. Its start codon was altered from TTG to ATG to facilitate an efficient initiation of translation. The downstream homologous region of srfA (939 bp) (see Fig. 2) was determined in a way that the transcriptional regulation of the succeeding open reading frame ycxA (1.2 kb) was restored. For transformation we used the B. subtilis derivative TS30 (9Stachelhaus T. Schneider A. Marahiel M.A. Science. 1995; 269: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), containing a cat resistance marker in thesrfA-C site, that permits screening on double crossover integration (see Fig. 2). After transformation of B. subtilis TS30 with the srfA deletion plasmid pKE19, three transformants with the phenotype MLSR and CmS were selected. The correct integration was confirmed by Southern blotting analysis, which revealed the correct substitution by double crossover (data not shown). The resulting strain carrying the deletion of the entire srfA operon (26.1 kb) including the surfactin synthetases A-C and srfA-TE was designated KE10 (see Fig. 2). The incapacity of B. subtilis KE10 to produce surfactin was demonstrated by non-hemolytic activity of cell broth on blood agar plates as well as by HPLC/MS analysis (data not shown). It has been reported that competence gene transcription and transformation efficiency inB. subtilis can be increased using multicopy expression of the competence regulator comS (19Liu L. Nakano M.M. Lee O.H. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5144-5152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following this approach, we integrated a second copy of comS into the α-amylase encoding site of the chromosome to enhance transformation efficiency. ComS (138 bp) was cloned under the control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induciblespac promoter in the Bacillus amyE integration vector pDR66 (20Ireton K. Rudner D.Z. Siranosian K.J.

However, the selective presence of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) makes dopaminergic neurons more resistant to oxidative stress caused by glutathione depletion. To further investigate the mechanisms of BH4 protection, we examined the effects of BH4on superoxide levels in individual living mesencephalic neurons. Dopaminergic neurons have intrinsically lower levels of superoxide than nondopaminergic neurons. In addition, inhibiting BH4synthesis increased superoxide in dopaminergic neurons, while BH4 supplementation decreased superoxide in nondopaminergic cells. BH4 is also a cofactor in catecholamine and NO production. In order to exclude the possibility that the antioxidant effects of BH4 are mediated by dopamine and NO, we used fibroblasts in which neither catecholamine nor NO production occurs. In fibroblasts, BH4 decreased baseline reactive oxygen species, and attenuated reactive oxygen species increase by rotenone and antimycin A. Physiologic concentrations of BH4 directly scavenged superoxide generated by potassium superoxide in vitro. We hypothesize that BH4 protects dopaminergic neurons from ordinary oxidative stresses generated by dopamine and its metabolites and that environmental insults or genetic defects may disrupt this intrinsic capacity of dopaminergic neurons and contribute to their degeneration in Parkinson's disease.

Although these findings suggest that dopaminergic neurons are susceptible to oxidative stress, studies in vivo have not observed dopaminergic neuronal death following the oxidative stress generated by glutathione depletion (11Toffa S.

Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in primary monolayer (14Nakamura K. Wang W. Kang U.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1850-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and reaggregate (15Nakamura K. Won L. Heller A. Kang U.J. Brain Res. 2000; 873: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) cultures are less susceptible to the toxicity of glutathione depletion than nondopaminergic neurons. To explain this unanticipated resistance of dopaminergic neurons to oxidative stress, we hypothesized that dopaminergic neurons may contain additional antioxidants for the metabolism of ROS. One candidate is tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is present abundantly in dopaminergic neurons where it functions as a cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in catecholamine synthesis. Recently, BH4has also been found to decrease superoxide formed by xanthine/xanthine oxidase (16Wever R.M.F. van Dam T. nan Rijn H.J.M. de Groot F. Rabelink T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), a macrophage/phorbol myristate acetate reaction system (17Kojima S. Icho T. Kajiwara Y. Kubota K.

BH4 also mediates the marked preferential resistance of dopaminergic neurons to glutathione depletion (15Nakamura K. Won L. Heller A. Kang U.J. Brain Res. 2000; 873: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, BH4 may provide dopaminergic neurons with an additional pathway for the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this paper, we delineate a mechanism underlying the increased resistance of dopaminergic neurons to oxidative stress. First, using microfluorimetry of individual living neurons, we show that dopaminergic neurons have lower levels of superoxide than nondopaminergic neurons. We then show that the presence of BH4 is both sufficient and necessary to maintain low superoxide levels in dopaminergic neurons, and in fibroblasts that have been engineered to synthesize BH4 but do not produce dopamine or NO. Last, we show that BH4 decreases superoxidein vitro through a direct scavenging mechanism. Cultures were prepared as described previously (15Nakamura K. Won L. Heller A. Kang U.J. Brain Res. 2000; 873: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, timed pregnant Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Madison, WI). Pieces of ventral mesencephalon were dissected from embryonic gestation day 14 (E14) rat embryos (day of conception defined as day 0), and then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 0.4% trypsin in calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution. Pieces were then triturated in 0.015% DNase using flame-polished Pasteur pipettes. Cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 200,000 viable cells/cm2. Cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h, the medium was changed, and 10 μg/ml 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine was added to inhibit glial growth. Cells were grown an additional 4–6 days prior to study. Glia represented less than 15% of the total cells in cultures, based on the number of cells that lacked immunoreactivity to neurofilament protein 200 or neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) antibodies. Relative superoxide levels were determined by measuring the rate of increase in ethidium (Et) fluorescence generated by the oxidation of hydroethidine (HEt) by superoxide (24Bindokas V. Jordan J. Lee C. Miller R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All measurements were made with a Nikon Diaphot epifluorescence microscope, and illumination with a 150 W Xe arc (attenuated by a neutral density 1.5, ultraviolet-grade filter; Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). Et imaging used standard rhodamine optics (excitation 510–560 nm; dichroic mirror 580 nm; emission >590 nm) (Nikon, Melville, NY). Images were formed using a 40X Fluor NA 0.85 objective (Nikon) and collected on a Hamamatsu ICCD (sensitivity set at 7.0). Images were 8-bit (256 intensity levels) and 16 frames were averaged every 10 s. Background subtraction was made using the first image obtained when HEt solution was added. Data acquisition was controlled by MetaFluor or MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.), and average intensity over identified regions of interest were logged to hard disc and displayed in real time. The relative superoxide level for each cell was determined from the slope of the increase in ethidium fluorescence over time, fit by linear regression. HEt, a dye freely permeable to cells (25Gallop P.M. Paz M.A. Henson E. Latt S.A. BioTechniques. 1984; 2: 32-36Google Scholar, 26Carter W.O. Narayanan P.K. Robinson J.P. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was freshly prepared and used at a final concentration of 3.2 μm. We also measured the oxidation of 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein to 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) which can be caused by various ROS and reactive nitrogen species (27Ischiropoulos H. Gow A. Thom S.R. Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Images were obtained in the presence of 33 μm 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein at 5-s intervals for 15 min. Images were corrected by subtracting an autofluoresence image obtained before dye addition. Optics utilized excitation at 460–490, dichroic mirror 500, emission >515 nm. Rate of fluorescence increase was determined by fitting a line to the final 5 min by linear regression. To quantify fluorescence, cell somata were circled, and the average cytosolic fluorescence computed. Because systematic differences in somal volumes between dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons would alter fluorescence intensities, any volume difference could confound our interpretation of ROS differences. Accordingly, mean cross-sectional somal areas (and hence cell volume) were compared between dopaminergic and nondopaminergic neurons and were found to be comparable (data not shown). Neurons in which fluorescence measurements were made were identified as either dopaminergic or nondopaminergic based on post-hoc TH-immunohistochemistry. After each study, the location of the field of cells was marked on the slide. Cells were then washed with 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 15 min. Cells were exposed to 0.6% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min to remove endogenous peroxidase activity, and preincubated with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Cells were incubated at room temperature overnight in primary polyclonal anti-TH antiserum (1:1000). Cultures were next incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody at 1:200 dilution, and an additional 1 h with an avidin-biotin conjugate of peroxidase (Vectastain ABC kit). Dopaminergic neurons were visualized as a black reaction product, using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in the presence of cobalt chloride (0.02%) and nickel ammonium sulfate (0.02%). Following immunohistochemistry, the original field of imaged cells field was found and re-imaged. The orientation and location of stained cells were matched, and neurons were identified as dopaminergic or nondopaminergic based on immunostaining. Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in T162 flasks prior to harvest. Cells were resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, sonicated and centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 2 min. The supernatant was frozen at −20 °C. A total of 25 μl of supernatant from each sample were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Following transfer, membranes were incubated overnight in 5% nonfat milk, and then incubated 1 h with primary antibodies against endothelial NOS (eNOS) at 1:500, inducible NOS (iNOS) at 1:1000, or constitutive NOS (cNOS, neuronal or brain NOS) at 1:175 in 3% milk. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase, 1:2000) in 3% milk, and then developed using ECL. Saturated potassium superoxide (KO2) solution was made by mixing KO2 in dimethyl sulfoxide, centrifuging at 1500 rpm for 5 min, and then decanting the supernatant (24Bindokas V. Jordan J. Lee C. Miller R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure yields about 3.6 mm solution (28Reiter C.D. Teng R.J. Beckman J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32460-32466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The stock solution of KO2 was then added to buffer containing 10 μmHEt (for a final concentration of 150 μm), and Et fluorescence was monitored every 20 s for 160 s, using a fluorometer. The superoxide level was determined from the slope of the increase in Et fluorescence over time, fit by linear regression. When indicated, BH4 was added immediately prior to adding KO2, at final concentrations ranging from 20 nmto 200 μm. Cu,Zn-SOD (9 units/ml) was used as a control. The effects of BH4 on KO2-generated superoxide levels were also measured by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry using a spin trapping agent 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DEPMPO) (19Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S.S. Karoui H. Tordo P. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9220-9225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 29Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 247: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). DEPMPO was prepared as a 40 mm solution in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, treated with an iron chelator, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (N,N-bis[2-(bis[carboxymethyl]amino)ethyl]glycine) (DPTA) (1 mm). Catalase (300 units/ml) was also added to prevent other oxygen radicals from contaminating the EPR spectra. Spectra were recorded within 1 min after mixing, with a Varian E-12 EPR spectrometer equipped with a century series bridge (E-102) and a TM011 cavity mounted horizontally in the magnet. EPR spectra were recorded at X-band (9.45 GHz), using 30 mW of power, a time constant of 0.1 s, and modulation amplitude of 0.5 G. Spectra were acquired in 30 s. The mean and standard error of the signal amplitude was calculated as the signal height of the 5th line of the DEPMPO spectrum taken from 9 to 10 measurements from each of three separate experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using the GB-STAT statistical package (Dynamic Microsystems, Silver Spring, MD). Standard errors were calculated for each mean, and statistical differences between groups were determined by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-hoc test as indicated. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY); and fetal bovine serum from Intergen (Purchase, NY). Trypsin was purchased from Worthington Biochemical Corp. (Freehold, NJ); 15-mm diameter glass coverslips from Carolina Biological (Burlington, NC); 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP), N-acetylserotonin (NAS), DNase,l-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine,N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), DPTA, and potassium superoxide from Sigma, DEMPPO from OXIS Health Products (Portland, OR). Antibodies against TH antiserum were obtained from Pel-Freez (Rogers, AR); antibodies against eNOS, iNOS, and cNOS from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); Vectastain ABC kit from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA); mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 and bovine pulmonary artery endothelium cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA); and whole rat brain extract from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). HEt and 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), sepiapterin from RBI (Natick, MA), and BH4 from Schircks (Jona, Switzerland). SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Novex (Carlsbad, CA). We first examined the effects of BH4 on superoxide levels in individual mesencephalic dopaminergic and nondopaminergic neurons using Et fluorescence. Dopaminergic (n = 56) neurons had significantly lower baseline levels of superoxide than nondopaminergic neurons (n = 924), consistent with the endogenous presence of BH4 within dopaminergic neurons (Fig. 1). Sepiapterin (20 μm) is converted to BH4intracellularly (30Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Edelstein M.P. Bigham E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5599-5607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and increases BH4 levels in total mesencephalic neurons comparable to those in dopaminergic neurons (31Nakamura K. Wright D.A. Wiatr T. Kowlessur D. Milstien S. Lei X.G. Kang U.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Sepiapterin significantly decreased superoxide in nondopaminergic neurons to levels comparable to those in dopaminergic neurons, without further decreasing superoxide in dopaminergic neurons (n = 246 and 14, respectively) (Fig. 1). To decrease BH4 levels, we inhibited BH4 synthesis using DAHP (1 mm) and NAS (0.1 mm). Each of these compounds decreases BH4 to less than 5% of control levels in cell lines (30Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Edelstein M.P. Bigham E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5599-5607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mesencephalic neurons, DAHP and NAS in combination decrease BH4 levels to about 16% of control (15Nakamura K. Won L. Heller A. Kang U.J. Brain Res. 2000; 873: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). BH4 depletion increased superoxide in dopaminergic neurons without affecting superoxide in nondopaminergic neurons (n = 20 and 316, respectively). Furthermore, BH4 depletion increased superoxide levels in dopaminergic neurons beyond the levels of nondopaminergic neurons. The observation that DAHP and NAS failed to alter BH4 levels in nondopaminergic neurons is consistent with the absence of endogenous BH4 in these cells. Therefore, superoxide levels are inversely related to BH4 levels in mesencephalic neurons. BH4 is employed as a required cofactor by catecholamine synthesis enzymes and by nitric-oxide synthase, both of which are expressed in our cultures of mesencephalic neurons. Because products of both these enzyme systems can modulate superoxide production, altering BH4 levels in mesencephalic cultures could indirectly modulate superoxide by affecting levels of catecholamines or NO. To understand BH4 effects on superoxide levels in the absence of BH4-dependent enzymes, we examined superoxide levels in primary cultures of fibroblasts (PF) and cultures of a fibroblast line genetically engineered to express GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (PFG), the rate-limiting enzyme in BH4 synthesis. Neither of these cell types synthesizes catecholamines. PFG produce BH4 but not l-DOPA or dopamine (32Bencsics C. Wachtel S.R. Milstien S. Hatakeyama K. Becker J.B. Kang U.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4449-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PFG produced BH4 and PF did not (TableI). PFG also had much lower levels of superoxide compared with PF (Fig.2 K). Addition of sepiapterin (20 μm) to PF markedly increased BH4 levels (Table I) and also decreased Et fluorescence dramatically compared with controls (Fig. 2 K). The decreased superoxide level in sepiapterin-treated PF was comparable to superoxide levels in PFG (Fig.2 K). Inhibition of BH4 synthesis in PFG by DAHP (1 mm) and NAS (1 mm) decreased BH4PFG to undetectable levels (Table I), and increased superoxide levels. These data indicate that BH4 is sufficient to decrease superoxide, independent of its role as a cofactor for dopamine synthesis.Table IBH4 levels of genetically modified fibroblastsBaselineDAHP/NASSepiapterinPF0 ± 00 ± 0946 ± 214ap < 0.01versus respective untreated controls by Bonferronit tests. n = five to seven separate cultures per group with 12 fields counted in each culture.PFG212 ± 29.7bp < 0.01 versus PF.0 ± 0ap < 0.01versus respective untreated controls by Bonferronit tests. n = five to seven separate cultures per group with 12 fields counted in each culture.NDcND, not done.Control fibroblasts (PF) and fibroblasts expressing BH4 (PFG) were cultured in the presence of DAHP (1 mm) and NAS (1 mm) or sepiapterin (20 μm).

After 2 days cultures were harvested and BH4 levels (pmol/mg protein) were measured. Data show mean ± S.E. To determine if BH4 lowers ROS through its effect on NOS, we examined whether fibroblasts express NOS. NOS has been shown to produce superoxide instead of NO in the absence of BH4 and NO can also scavenge superoxide (33Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analyses did not detect eNOS, iNOS, or cNOS expression in either PF or PFG (Fig.3). To provide further evidence for the absence of NOS effect on superoxide levels in our system, we examined the effect of l-NAME on superoxide levels. Treatment of fibroblasts with l-NAME (1 mm) for 2 h had no significant effect on basal superoxide levels or following treatment with sepiapterin (20 μm) (TableII). These data indicate that BH4 decreases superoxide levels in fibroblasts independent of NOS.Table IIEffect of NOS inhibitor on superoxide levelsBaselinel-NAME (1 mm)PF100 ± 8.18109 ± 7.39PF + S27.0 ± 5.38ap < 0.01versus PF and PF/l-NAME by Newman-Keulspost-hoc test, n = 21–25 cells per group.28.2 ± 3.94ap < 0.01versus PF and PF/l-NAME by Newman-Keulspost-hoc test, n = 21–25 cells per group.Fibroblasts (PF) were treated with or without l-NAME (1 mm) for 2 h in the presence or absence of sepiapterin (20 μm) (PF/S) and superoxide levels were measured by the Et fluorescence method.

Et fluorescence values are normalized to the mean level in untreated PF. Data are expressed as mean ± SE. To further investigate the effects of BH4 on ROS, we employed DCF fluorescence. Oxidation of 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein to DCF by various ROS and reactive nitrogen species has been noted (27Ischiropoulos H. Gow A. Thom S.R. Kooy N.W. Royall J.A. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Sepiapterin (20 μm) decreased DCF fluorescence in PF (Fig.2 L), and PFG had lower levels of DCF fluorescence than PF (Fig. 2 L). In addition, inhibition of BH4synthesis in PFG by DAHP (1 mm) and NAS (1 mm) increased DCF fluorescence. These DCF data were consistent with our Et fluorescence data. Taken together, our data using Et and DCF fluorescence suggest that BH4 decreases both superoxide and downstream superoxide metabolites such as peroxides and other ROS. In order to assess the effects of BH4 on mitochondrial production of superoxide, rotenone and antimycin A were used to block electron transport distal to the primary sites of superoxide formation in complexes I and III, respectively (10Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 34Herrero A. Barja G. J. Bioenerg.

Both rotenone (20 nm) and antimycin A (1 μm) significantly increased superoxide levels in control fibroblasts. In both cases, this increase in superoxide was significantly attenuated in cells that either expressed BH4 or were pretreated with sepiapterin (Fig. 4). These data indicate that BH4 either interferes with mitochondrial ROS generation, directly scavenges ROS formed within mitochondria, or both. Mitochodrial depolarization-induced release of ethidium and subsequent fluorescence enhancement following binding to nucleic acids can complicate the interpretation of ethidium-based methods of superoxide measurement (37Budd S.L. Castilho R.F. Nicholls D.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To test for this complication in our system, we used myxothiazole to depolarize mitochondria without increasing superoxide production. Treatment of fibroblasts with myxothiazole (2 μm) plus oligomycin (2 μg/ml) inhibited the slow Et fluorescence increase observed under baseline conditions (data not shown). In addition, subsequent treatment with carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (1 μm) did not produce an increase in Et fluorescence, demonstrating the lack of artifactual increase in Et fluorescence under our experimental conditions. To investigate whether BH4 can scavenge superoxide directly, we used an in vitro model of KO2-generated superoxide (24Bindokas V. Jordan J. Lee C. Miller R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1324-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Lokesh B.R. Cunningham M.L. Toxicol. Lett. 1986; 34: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations, KO2increased superoxide as indicated by an increased rate of HEt conversion into Et (Fig. 5). However, this KO2-induced increase in superoxide levels was significantly attenuated by preincubation with BH4 at concentrations as low as 2 μm. The effect of 200 μm BH4 on scavenging superoxide was equivalent to that of 9 units/ml SOD. BH4 (20 μm) alone did not alter the fluorescence of 100 nm Et in vitro (data not shown), excluding the possibility that BH4 directly interferes with Et fluorescence. Although KO2 generates primarily superoxide, oth"

Transient transfection with constructs of deletedCOL2A1 promoter sequences driving the luciferase reporter gene revealed that the region spanning −266 to +121 base pairs showed Sp1-enhancing effects, whatever the differentiation state. In contrast, Sp3 did not influence COL2A1 gene transcription. Concomitant overexpression of the two Sp proteins demonstrated that Sp3 blocked the Sp1 induction of COL2A1 promoter activity. Moreover, inhibition of Sp1/Sp3 binding to their target DNA sequence decreased both COL2A1 gene transcription and Sp1-enhancing effects. DNase I footprinting and gel retardation assays revealed that Sp1 and Sp3 bind specifically to cis-sequences of theCOL2A1 gene promoter whereby they exert their transcriptional effects. Sp1 and Sp3 levels were found to be reduced in de-differentiated chondrocytes, as revealed by DNA-binding and immunochemical study. Sp1 specifically activated collagen neosynthesis whatever the differentiation state of chondrocytes, suggesting that this factor exerts a major role in the expression of collagen type II.

Type II collagen is considered as a critical phenotypic marker gene for analysis of molecular events involved in chondrogenesis process as well as in chondrocyte phenotype maintenance. Alteration of type II collagen expression in cartilage may be due to a variety of genetic, inflammatory, or degenerative circumstances and may lead to a variety of chondrodysplasias and joint diseases such as osteoarthritis (3Ala-Kokko L.

In osteoarthritis, chondrocytes undergo de-differentiation and synthesize types I and III collagens at the expense of type II (9Nimni M. Deshmukh K.

Similarly, when chondrocytes are subcultured in vitro as monolayers, they progressively reduce their synthesis of type II collagen (12Benya P.D. Padilla S.R. Nimni M.E.

However, they can recover the chondrocytic phenotype by transfer to three-dimensional culture systems (14Bonaventure J. Khadom N. Cohen-Solal L. Ng K.H. Bourguignon J. Lasselin C. Freissinger P. Exp.

Therefore,in vitro analysis of the molecular mechanisms that regulateCOL2A1 gene expression can be an approach to understand the process of phenotype alteration in chondrocytes, and its impact on joint diseases. A 48-bp1 minimal DNA element has been identified as an enhancer that directs chondrocyte-specific expression of the COL2A1 gene in transgenic mice (17Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Mukhopadhyay K. Smith C.N.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5715-5718Crossref Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Such an element was also found in the rat COL2A1 gene (20Horton W. Miyashita T. Kohno K. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8864-8868Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,21Wang L. Balakir R. Horton W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19878-19881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse enhancer appears as a large and abundant complex with chondrocyte nuclear proteins named chondrocyte-specific enhancer proteins, including SOX9, a new long form of SOX5 (L-SOX5), and SOX6 (19Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5715-5718Crossref Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The three SOX genes are coexpressed and cooperate inCOL2A1 gene activation. Although SOX9 is absolutely required for cartilage formation (22Bi W. Deng J.M. Zang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar), it is unable by itself to induce the chondrocyte phenotype on 10T1/2 cells, suggesting that other factors are required to induce the cartilaginous phenotype (23Xie W.-F. Kondo S. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5026-5032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that C-Krox, a member of the Krox family (24Galéra P. Musso M. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9372-9376Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar,25Galéra P. Park R.W. Ducy P. Mattéi M.-G. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21331-21339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), activates COL2A1 gene expression in primary rabbit articular chondrocytes (RAC) through a 458-bp enhancer containing C-Krox-responsive elements present in the first intron (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, in de-differentiated chondrocytes, C-Krox levels decrease and the factor acts as an inhibitor of COL2A1 gene expression through the promoter region, in which C-Krox-DNA-binding sites were also identified. Based on these findings, C-Krox could appear as a major factor in maintenance of chondrocyte phenotype, albeit other proteins are likely to participate in the control mechanism (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 appears as a good candidate to act in concert with SOX9 and C-Krox to control type II collagen-specific expression. This factor is a ubiquitous zinc finger protein, homologue to C-Krox, that was originally identified by its role in SV40 gene expression (27Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Sp1 recognizes GC- or GT-rich motifs widely distributed in several promoters, including those of housekeeping, tissue-specific, and cell cycle-regulated genes (28Lania L. Majello B. De Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 29Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 30Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). It generally stimulates their transcription activity. Like that of Sp1, the expression of Sp3 is also ubiquitous. Its DNA binding affinities and recognition site specificity are identical to those of Sp1. Recent studies indicate also that Sp3 is a dual functional regulatory protein, either activating or repressing transcription of the target gene, with the predominant effect depending on cell type, DNA-binding site context, and additional transcription factors present in a particular background (28Lania L. Majello B. De Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 30Suske G.

Chem. 1997; 257: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Furthermore, simultaneous ectopic expression of both Sp1 and Sp3 inDrosophila SL2 cells reversed Sp1-induced activation of several genes, suggesting a functional antagonism between Sp1 and Sp3 (33Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 34Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G.S. Stein J.L.

Other Sp1-inducible genes are synergistically activated by Sp1 and Sp3, indicating that interaction between the two factors may depend on the context in which the target gene is found (36Liang Y. Robinson D.F. Dennig J. Suske G. Fahl W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11792-11797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37Ihn H. Trojanowska M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Sp1 interacts with numerous proteins to form homotypic and heterotypic complexes (30Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 38Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sp1, by interacting with itself when bound on separate Sp1-DNA-binding sites, can induce loop formation between distant regions of a gene (39Li R. Knight J.D. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 40Su W. Jackson S. Tjian R. Echols H. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In the case of theCOL2A1 gene, Sp1 and a Sp1-like factor called CIIZFP are involved in the cartilage-specific expression of rat collagen type II, through a looping mechanism between the promoter and the enhancer regions (41Savagner P. Krebsbach P.H. Miyashita T. Liebman J. Yamada Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Additionally, an Sp1 binding activity was found in nuclear extracts from chondrocytes and Sp1-DNA binding was shown to increase as chondrocytes were allowed to de-differentiate in vitro (42Dharmavaram R.M. Liu G. Mowers S.D. Jimenez S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 257: 26918-26925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Co-transfection experiments in DrosophilaSchneider line L2 cells demonstrated also that the transcriptional activity of two COL2A1 promoters (−577/+63, −131/+63) was enhanced by Sp1. It can therefore be predicted that Sp1 may be involved in type II collagen expression during chondrogenesis as well as in the maintenance of chondrocytic phenotype. The fact that Sp1 expression is altered in the de-differentiating chondrocytes (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Dharmavaram R.M. Liu G. Mowers S.D. Jimenez S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 257: 26918-26925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar) also reinforces the presumption that Sp1 could be another key factor for induction and/or maintenance of COL2A1 gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the respective role of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors in the regulation of COL2A1 gene expression in RAC. We found that Sp1 and Sp3 from RAC nuclear extracts bind to regions of theCOL2A1 promoter and first intron enhancer. Transient transfection with constructs containing serial deletions of the proximal promoter and intronic enhancer regions revealed multiple regulatory elements that contribute to type II collagen expression in both differentiated and de-differentiated chondrocytes. Several Sp1/Sp3-binding sites were found within the −266/+121 sequence, which conferred high level expression in this cell type. Binding of Sp1 to these sequences appears as essential for high level expression of type II collagen in differentiated chondrocytes. Sp1 and Sp3 were also shown to differentially affect the transcriptional activity of the gene. RAC, HCS-2/8 human chondrosarcoma cell line (43Takigawa M. Koji T. Hai-Ou P. Enomoto M. Kinoshita A. Suzuki F. Takano Y. Mori Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3996-4002PubMed Google Scholar), and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were cultured as previously described (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chondrocytes were plated at 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm dishes or 2 × 105cells per 9.6-cm2 dishes in DMEM + 10% FCS. Cells at 80% confluency were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation as described (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter plasmids (10 μg of each) were co-transfected with various amounts (0.1–30 μg) of Sp1 or Sp3 expression vectors (pEVR2/Sp1 or pRC/CMV/Sp3) (33Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). 10–15 h after transfection, the medium was changed and cells were harvested 24 h later. Luciferase activity was assayed on total cell extracts using a commercial kit (Promega), and corrected for protein amount (Bradford colorimetric method, Bio-Rad). Data are expressed in relative luciferase activity and represented mean ± S.D. of three independent samples. Chondrocytes were incubated with 100 nm mithramycin (Sigma) for 24 h, after the 10–15-h transfection period, in order to block Sp1 and Sp3 interaction to their specific DNA-binding sites. For decoy experiments, primary RAC were transfected as above with 15 μg of reporter plasmids, together with mcSp1 wild-type oligodeoxynucleotide (0.15 μm) (Table I, mcSp1wt.). After overnight transfection, the medium was changed and the cultures were incubated for a further 24-h period before determination of luciferase activity.Table IDouble-stranded oligonucleotides used in this study1-aThe mutation substitutions in the binding sites are represented in bold.1-a The mutation substitutions in the binding sites are represented in bold. Open table in a new tab Most of the COL2A1-luciferase reporter vectors were previously described (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some additional plasmids have been generated. One contained a herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter region derived from the pRL-TK reporter vector containing the Renilla luciferase gene (Promega). The 760-bp HSV-TK promoter, digested byBglII-HindIII, was removed from the pRL-TK reporter plasmid and cloned upstream of the luciferase gene in theBglII-HindIII sites of pGL2 basic reporter vector (Promega). Upstream of this aspecific promoter, two wild-type −107/−135α1(II) oligonucleotides containing two Sp1 consensus binding sites were cloned (designated mcSp1wt, Table I). To measure specificity of the effects, two copies of the mutant −107/−135α1(II) oligonucleotide were cloned upstream the aspecific promoter (mcSp1 mut) (Table I). These two reporter plasmids were sequenced to confirm the correct construction. Nuclear extracts were prepared as maxi- (44Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) or minipreparations (45Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar), as previously described (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed with the oligonucleotides shown in Table I in the conditions previously described (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For mithramycin treatment, DNA probes were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of the drug (100 nm) and the nuclear extracts or Sp1 recombinant protein (Promega) were then added to the binding reaction mixture. In the antibody interference assays, 2 μl of preimmune serum or anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to each reaction mixture for 10–15 h at 4 °C in the presence of the oligonucleotide probe. At the end of the incubation, the samples were run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, in nondenaturing conditions. In DNase I footprinting experiments, labeling of the 153-bpBamHI-XhoI (+2689/+2842), 305-bpXhoI-BamHI (+2384/+2689), −391/−21-bpStyI-NarI, and −266/−21-bpSmaI-NarI fragments of COL2A1 gene, gel purification, and elution were processed as previously described (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Southwestern analysis, 20–40 μg of nuclear extracts were run on a 10%-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. After electrotransfer, the proteins fixed on the membranes were processed according to the method of Singh et al. (47Singh H. Clerc R.G. Lebowitz J.H. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 252-261PubMed Google Scholar), and submitted to a denaturation/renaturation protocol. Briefly, filters were incubated in binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) containing 6 m guanidium-HCl, for 10 min, followed by a further 10-min incubation in the same binding buffer containing only 3 m guanidium-HCl. This procedure was repeated four times, diluting each time the guanidium solution by a factor 2. The membrane was then incubated during 30 min in the binding buffer, and incubated 1 h in BLOTTO (bovine lacto technical transfer optimizer buffer) (10% nonfat dry milk, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) to block nonspecific binding. A final 2-min treatment in the BLOTTO buffer containing 0.25% milk powder was performed. Membranes were then hybridized with 1 pmol of the oligonucleotide of interest, previously radiolabeled with [γ-32P]dATP in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase. The hybridization was performed for 15 h at room temperature in the binding buffer used for EMSAs, including 125 μg of calf thymus DNA and 125 μg of poly(dI-dC). Filters were then washed four times with the binding buffer, each for 8 min, and finally subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. Total RNA was extracted as previously described (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One-microgram samples of total RNA were reverse transcribed into cDNA in the presence of 50 pmol of oligo(dT), 40 units of RNaseOut (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm of each dNTPs (Life Technologies, Inc.), first-strand buffer 5 times, and 60 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 15 min and followed by a 5-min step at 99 °C. Amplification of the generated cDNAs was performed in an Omni E Hybaid thermocycler using a PCR kit (Life Technologies, Inc.), in the presence of both sense and antisense primers (50 pmol) as follows: COL2A1: sense, 5′-GACCCCATGCAGTACATG-3′/antisense, 5′-GACGGTCTTGCCCCACTT-3′ (48Takaishi H. Yamada H. Yabe Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); Sp1: sense, 5′-CTACCCCTACCTCAAAGG-3′/antisense, 5′-CTCTCCTTCTTTTTGCTGG-3′; and Sp3: sense, 5′-TAAGGTGTATTGCGTCTT-3′/antisense, 5′-TGAGGTGGTCTTAAGAAT-3′ (49Kalff-Suske M. Kunz J. Grzeschik K.-H. Suske G. Genomics. 1996; 37: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); β-actin, sense, 5′-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3′/antisense, 5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′ (50Lupparello C. Ginty A.F. Gallagher J.A. Pucci-Minafra I. Minafra S. Differentiation. 1993; 55: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A variable number of PCR cycles were done as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Then, an additional step at 72 °C for 10 min was included. cDNAs were analyzed in 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The amplification reaction yielded expected cDNA sizes (COL2A1, 648 bp; Sp1, 821 bp; Sp3, 514 bp; and β-actin, 548 bp). After photography of the gels, the intensity of the corresponding bands was quantified by densitometric scanning using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) and normalized to β-actin cDNA levels. RAC were cultured in 100-mm Petri dishes for characterization of the different maturation forms of type II collagen by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. The cell layer-associated proteins (50 μg) were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in denaturing conditions using Tris glycine buffer containing 1% SDS (40 mA, 2.5 h). The gel was then equilibrated for 30 min in the transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol (v/v)), and the proteins were electrotransferred on a nitrocellulose membrane (30 min, 10 V), using a Bio-Rad transfer apparatus (Semi-Dry Transfer Cell). Free protein-binding sites were blocked by incubating the filters for 30 min in PBS buffer containing 10% nonfat dry milk. Then, the membranes were rinsed three times in PBS, and the filters were incubated for 24 h in the presence of an anti-human type II collagen antibody raised in rabbit (kindly provided by D.-J. Hartmann, Faculté de Pharmacie, Lyon) (1/400 dilution in PBS-containing 10% nonfat dry milk). Filters were then incubated for 2 h with a secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated guinea pig anti-IgG, 1/10,000 dilution in PBS + 10% nonfat dry milk). The blots were rinsed six times for 5 min in PBS. Finally, type II collagen expression was revealed using an ECL + Plus Western blot detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Western blot analysis of Sp1 and Sp3 in RAC nuclear extracts was performed as previously described (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the filters were incubated with primary anti-Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies (1/1000 dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and then treated with a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit, 1/1000 dilution) coupled to peroxidase. Sp1 and Sp3 expression was revealed with the ECL kit as above. RAC were seeded in 10% FCS-containing DMEM, in 9.6-cm2 dishes, and transiently transfected with the Sp1 and Sp3 expression vectors or the corresponding insertless plasmids in DMEM + 10% FCS supplemented with sodium ascorbate (50 μg/ml) for 15 h. Then, the medium was replaced by the same fresh medium supplemented with β-aminopropionitrile (100 μg/ml) and [3H]proline (2 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the cultures were pulsed for 24 h. At the end of the incubation, the culture medium was collected and the labeled collagen was assayed with pure bacterial collagenase (51Peterkofsky B. Diegelmann R. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). The cell layer-associated collagen was also assayed after scraping and sonication of the cells, since that fraction generally contains large amounts of type II collagen (13Galéra P. Rédini F.

Levels of collagen and noncollagenous proteins were corrected for protein amount determined by the Bradford colorimetric assay. We previously characterized a 458-bp enhancer in the first intron of the human COL2A1 gene (+2384/+2842) and a 266-bp short promoter, both involved in the specific expression of the gene in RAC. They include DNA-binding sites for a zinc finger protein, C-Krox, which was shown to differentially regulate the transcription ofCOL2A1 gene according to the differentiation state of the chondrocytes (26Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L. Takigawa M. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27421-27438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As Sp1 and C-Krox belong to the same family of transcription factors, it was of interest to determine the binding sites and potential functions of these proteins on the two sequences responsible for type II collagen-specific expression. This may provide clues for understanding mechanisms governing cartilage-specificCOL2A1 gene transcription. To determine whether these promoter and first intron sites interacted with other transcription factors, in vitro DNase I footprinting assays were performed on both regions. Several regions of the promoter were found to be protected by proteins present in nuclear extracts from RAC (Fig. 1, Aand B). They were located between −66/−103 bp, −107/−135 bp, −225/−305 bp, and −305/−360 bp. These sequences also bound Sp1 recombinant protein, except for the −329/−360-bp region (Fig. 1,A and B). Sp1 interacts equally with the −188/−219 sequence that was not protected in the presence of nuclear extracts. Similar experiments performed on a fragment from the first intron ofCOL2A1 gene (+2689/+2842), previously shown to take par"
https://openalex.org/W1987094458,"The DNA damage inducible gene ribonucleotide reductase (RNR3) is regulated by a transcriptional repression mechanism by the recruitment of the Ssn6-Tup1 corepressor complex to its promoter by the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein Crt1. Ssn6-Tup1 is reported to represses transcription by interfering with transcription factors, recruiting histone deacetylases, and positioning nucleosomes at the promoter of its target genes. Two of the three mechanisms involve effects on chromatin structure, and therefore, we have delineated the nucleosomal structure of RNR3 in the repressed and derepressed state using multiple nuclease mapping strategies. A regular array of positioned nucleosomes is detected over the repressed RNR3 promoter that extends into the coding sequence. Treating cells with DNA damaging agents or deletingCRT1, SSN6, or TUP1 derepressesRNR3 transcription, and causes a dramatic disruption of nucleosome positioning over its promoter. Furthermore, derepression ofRNR3 correlated with changes in nuclease sensitivity within the upstream repression sequence (URS) region. Specifically, the loss of a MNase-hypersensitive site, and the appearance of strong DNase I hypersensitivity, was observed over the URS. Interestingly, we find that the binding of Crt1 to the promoter in the absence of Ssn6 or Tup1 is insufficient for nucleosome positioning or regulating chromatin structure at the URS; thus, these two functions are strictly dependent upon Ssn6-Tup1. We propose that RNR3 is regulated by changes in nucleosome positioning and chromatin structure that are mediated by Ssn6, Tup1, and Crt1.

It is widely accepted that packaging DNA into nucleosomes imposes a severe limitation on the accessibility of DNA to the transcription apparatus; therefore, the nucleosome plays an important role in the constitutive repression of gene transcription (4Svaren J.

Nevertheless, the packaging of DNA into chromatin is not exclusively repressive in nature. In some cases, higher-order chromatin structures facilitate transcription activation by holding distant regulatory elements into juxtaposition with themselves or the core promoter (2Wolffe A.P.

The mechanism of Ssn6-Tup1 mediated repression is an unresolved topic, and is considered to be controversial (6Roth S.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Moreover, even within this group only three classes of genes have been mapped, namely, mating type-specific genes, an oxygen-regulated gene, and carbon source regulated genes. Each of these classes differ in their requirement for SSN6 versus TUP1 (15Cooper J.P. Roth S.Y. Simpson R.T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1400-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 36Gavin I.M.

The enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis; thus, plays an essential role in DNA replication and repair (42Elledge S.J. Zhou Z.

InSaccharomyces cerevisiae it is composed of four subunits, which are encoded by four DNA damage-regulated genes (RNR1, RNR2, RNR3, and RNR4) (42Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem.

The RNR genes are repressed by upstream repression sequences (URS), thedamage responsive elements (DREs) or x-boxes, which serve as binding sites for the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein Crt1p (50Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Crt1 recruits the general co-repressor complex composed of Ssn6 and Tup1 (47Li B. Reese J.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4091-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 50Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) repressing gene expression. The exact role of Ssn6-Tup1, and the contributions of Crt1, in mediating repression of RNR3 is not known. Activation of DNA damage checkpoints results in the phosphorylation of Crt1, reducing its ability to cross-link to the promoter region of RNR3 (50Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). How the phosphorylation of Crt1 reduces its association with the promoter is unclear. Here we describe a comprehensive analysis of the nucleosomal structure of the RNR3 promoter in the repressed and derepressed state. A combination of high-resolution and low-resolution micrococcal nuclease (MNase) and DNase I sensitivity mapping studies clearly demonstrate that in the absence of DNA damage, an array of positioned nucleosomes covers the promoter and extends into the coding sequence. Upon DNA damage, the nucleosome structure at the promoter undergoes extensive remodeling, which is dependent on the checkpoint genesMEC1 and RAD53. DNase I and MNase footprinting revealed changes in nuclease sensitivity within the URS that correlated with the expression of RNR3. Interestingly, we find that the chromatin/DNA structure within the URS is dependent upon Crt1, Ssn6, and Tup1, indicating that Crt1 alone is insufficient for its formation. Our analysis has established that nucleosome positioning and remodeling regulates DNA damage inducible genes, and that the predominant function of Crt1 is to position nucleosomes over the promoter via the Ssn6-Tup1 corepressor complex. The wild type (YSW87), Δcrt1 (YJR352), Δssn6 (YJR221), and Δtup1 (YJR220) strains (47Li B. Reese J.C.

The Δssn6/CRT1-MYC12 strain (YJR485) was constructed by transforming Y588 withAvrII-digested pRS406-ssn6 (15Cooper J.P. Roth S.Y. Simpson R.T.

Briefly, yeast cells from a 1-liter culture grown to an optical density of about 1.0 at 600 nm was harvested and digested with Zymolyase T100 (Seikagaku). Nuclei were purified by differential centrifugation and finally resuspended in digestion buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.05 mm CaCl2) and incubated with 0, 2, and 4 units/ml MNase (Worthington) or 0, 0.05, and 0.1 units/ml DNase I (Worthington) for 10 min at 37 °C. The digestions were terminated by the addition of EDTA and the DNA was purified by RNase A and proteinase K digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 0.1 × TE buffer. For low-resolution mapping of nucleosomes by indirect end labeling, the purified DNA was subjected to a secondary digestion by PstI, then electrophoresed in 1.4% agarose gels in 1 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer, and transferred to Zetabind membrane (CUNO industries). The specific DNA sequences were detected by hybridized with a random primed body-labeled probe directed toward the end of thePstI site. The following primer sets were used to amplify the probes: PstI (+468) 5′-GCTAAGACTGAACGGTGAAGTGGCAG,PstI (+725) 5′-GGAAATCATAGCACATTCTTTCAAAGTATC;EcoRV (+57) 5′-CTCCCGTATCACCCGTTTGTC, EcoRV (+540) 5′-CATGGATACCTAGCGCCACACGCATTAC. For high-resolution mapping, multiple rounds of Taq DNA polymerase-based primer extension was carried out from a 32P-end-labeled primer, and the products were then resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide (19:1), 50% urea gel (40Weiss K. Simpson R.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4352-4360Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Images were captured on a PhosphorImager screen. The primers used to perform the primer extension reaction are as follows: RNR3+150 downstream, 5′- CTAAACCGTATGACAAACGGGTGATACGGGAGGT; RNR3–324 upstream, 5′-CGTGGTTGTCGCAGCAACGACACCTAGG; RNR3–586 upstream, 5′-GGCGCTGTGGCCGTGG- CTAGTTTCTTCT. Nuclei were isolated as for the MNase and DNase I mapping studies and resuspended in RE digestion buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mmspermine, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) (54Gregory P.D.

MluI orNcoI (New England Biolabs) was added to concentrations of 100 and 400 units/ml, and the digestion was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 37 °C. After purification, the DNA was digested withPstI (MluI-digested samples) or EcoRV (NcoI-digested samples) to completion. The products were resolved on agarose gels and detected by Southern blotting using the indirect end-labeling method. The PstI- andEcoRV-digested samples were hybridized to PCR-generated probes corresponding to the regions of +486 to +725 (PstI probe) and +57 to +540 (EcoRV probe) of RNR3, respectively. Blots were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics). Data was expressed as percent digested that was calculated by the ratio of the counts in the digested fragment to the total DNA. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed essentially as described in two previous publications (50Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 56Hecht A. Grunstein M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Cultures were treated for 2.5 h with 0.03% MMS prior to cross-linking, where indicated. Briefly, a 200-ml culture of yeast grown in YPAD to an A600= 1.0 were treated with formaldehyde (1% v/v) for 15 min at 23 °C, followed by an additional 5 min in 125 mm glycine. Cells were then disrupted by vortexing in the presence of glass beads, and the lysate was sonicated to generate an average DNA size of about 0.4–0.9 kilobases. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 1 μl of raw ascites fluid (Convance) to 400 μl of lysate. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C with 40 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads, the beads were washed extensively, and the DNA eluted (56Hecht A. Grunstein M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Following reversal of the formaldehyde-induced cross-links, 1/300 to 1/12000 of input DNA and 0.2 to 2% of immunoprecipitated DNAs were analyzed by semiquantitative PCR analysis with promoter-specific primers spanning the URS of each gene. Only one titration of immunoprecipitated DNA and two titrations of input DNA are shown in the figure to conserve space. The PCR products were detected by illumination of ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gels. To understand the contributions of chromatin structure in the transcriptional regulation of RNR3, we analyzed the nucleosomal architecture over its promoter. The first of these experiments utilized MNase to digest nuclei in situ, followed by the detection of the digestion products by indirect end labeling (53Ryan M.P. Stafford G.A., Yu, L. Cummings K.B. Morse R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 376-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Given that MNase displays sequence preference in the digestion of DNA, naked DNA was digested (deproteined genomic DNA) and analyzed in parallel. The digestion pattern generated from chromatin isolated from untreated cells (−MMS) is consistent with the presence of a well ordered nucleosomal array positioned over the RNR3promoter that extends into the protein coding region (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 4). The hallmark of a translationally positioned nucleosomal unit is a 140–150-base pair region that is protected from MNase digestion, compared with naked DNA, flanked by nuclease-hypersensitive sites; such a pattern is clearly seen. In particular, a nucleosome (−1) was detected over the TATA box that protects it from MNase digestion, compared with naked DNA (compare lanes 3 and 4with lanes 8 and 9). The data also shows that the major transcription start site (+1) is located within the internucleosomal linker region. It is noted that within the URS region (DREs), a hypersensitive site was observed in the chromatin sample that was not present in the naked DNA digestion reaction (arrowhead, lane 3). This site is likely to be caused by transcription factor binding to the promoter since the spacing between it and the hypersensitive site generated by nucleosome −1 is not consistent with a nucleosomal pattern (also see below). It is well recognized that the expression of most genes is accompanied by changes in chromatin structure (5Kingston R.E. Bunker C.A. Imbalzano A.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 905-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 12Mizzen C.A. Allis C.D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 57Svaren J. Horz W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 93-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); therefore, we monitored the changes in nucleosome positioning upon the derepression ofRNR3. The transcription of RNR3 can be stimulated to a high level by inducing DNA damage using MMS or the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (42Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 43Elledge S.J. Zhou Z. Allen J.B. Navas T.A. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with MMS to a final concentration of 0.02% MMS for 2.5 h, and were then processed for nuclease mapping. A representative Northern blot is shown in Fig.1 C. The pattern of MNase-digested chromatin from MMS-treated cells is nearly identical to that of digested naked DNA (comparelanes 6 and 7 to lanes 8 and9), indicating a disruption of the nucleosomal array. Specifically, the regions protected from digestion are fully accessible (filled circles), most notably the region over nucleosome −1 containing the TATA box. In addition, the intensity of the hypersensitive sites flanking each nucleosome is reduced. Activation ofRNR3 also correlates with changes in the digestion pattern over the URS. The MNase-hypersensitive site located within the nucleosome-free URS region (indicated by the arrow inlane 3 of Fig. 1 A) is lost upon gene activation, which is consistent with the predicted changes in Crt1 binding to the DREs (50Huang M. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Additional mapping studies were performed using DNase I, which does not display the same sequence bias of micrococcal nuclease (35Simpson R.T. Methods. 1998; 15: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 53Ryan M.P. Stafford G.A., Yu, L. Cummings K.B. Morse R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 376-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, DNase I can reveal changes in chromatin structure not detected by MNase mapping. Since DNase I is capable of digesting within chromosomal DNA at 10-base pair intervals due to the rotational phasing of DNA on the nucleosome, concentrations were chosen that result in the preferential digestion within the linker regions to allow for the detection of nucleosome positioning. In agreement with the MNase mapping data described above, the pattern generated from DNase I-digested chromatin from untreated cells is consistent with the presence of an ordered nucleosomal array (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, the pattern generated by MNase digestion is indicative of a nucleosomal array and is not an artifact of the sequence preference of this enzyme. An intense DNase I-hypersensitive site is detected between the edge of nucleosome −1 and the first DRE. Also consistent with the MNase mapping, treating cells with MMS results in a randomized digestion pattern in the region encompassing the TATA box and the coding sequences (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6 and 7), indicating extensive nucleosome remodeli"

F., and Stevens, J. L. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 13328–13337). The role of FAK in the control of apoptosis caused by nephrotoxicants was further investigated in LLC-PK1 cells that were stably transfected with either green fluorescent protein (GFP)-FAK or dominant negative acting deletion mutants of FAK, GFP-FAT, and GFP-FRNK. GFP-FAT and GFP-FRNK delayed the formation of focal adhesions and prevented the localization of endogenous (phosphorylated) FAK at these sites. GFP-FAT and GFP-FRNK overexpression potentiated the onset of apoptosis caused by the nephrotoxicant dichlorovinyl-cysteine. This was associated with an increased activation of caspase-3. GFP-FAT also potentiated apoptosis caused by doxorubicin but not cisplatin. The potentiation of apoptosis by GFP-FAT was related to an almost complete dephosphorylation of FAK; this did not occur in cells overexpressing only GFP. This dephosphorylation was associated with a pronounced loss of focal adhesion organization in GFP-FAT cells, in association with loss of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. In conclusion, the data indicate an important role of cell-matrix signaling in the control of chemically induced apoptosis; loss of FAK activity caused by toxic chemicals results in perturbations of focal adhesion organization with a subsequent inactivation of associated (signaling) molecules and loss of survival signaling. Decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is associated with loss of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers and precedes the onset of apoptosis in renal epithelial cells caused by nephrotoxicants (Van de Water, B., Nagelkerke, J.

The response of cells to such injury is crucial for the outcome of cell damage: cell survival or death. As a consequence of the cellular injury, various signaling pathways are (in)activated (4Leppa S. Bohmann D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6158-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 5Franklin R.A.

Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar). Depending on the type of signaling cascade cell death is either stimulated or suppressed. Although some signal transduction cascades, e.g. growth factor signaling through PKB1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, have been defined to play crucial roles in the regulation of the cellular response to damage (6Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar,7Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar), the role of many other signaling pathways remains largely unknown. Thus, little is known about the role of disturbances of the signal transduction pathways mediated by interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the cellular response to injury. Cell adhesion to ECM through integrin receptors is critical for normal cell function (8Boudreau N. Bissell M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 640-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 9Farrelly N. Lee Y.J. Oliver J. Dive C. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1337-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Perturbation of proper cell-ECM interactions is observed in various acute and chronic pathological conditions including ischemia/reperfusion injury, cancer, as well as exposure to toxic chemicals (10Norman J.T. Fine L.G. Exp. Nephrol. 1999; 7: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 11Kreidberg J.A. Symons J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F233-F242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dedhar S.

Loss of such interactions of normal cells results in the onset of apoptosis and is also referred to as anoikis (16Frisch S.M. Francis H. J.

Altered signaling as a result of loss of cell-ECM interactions is critical in this process, and focal adhesion kinase seems to play an important role (15Van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26901-26906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Engagement of integrins with the ECM results in activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a 125-kDa non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is localized at focal adhesions, the closest contacts between cells and the ECM (22Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). FAK consists of an N-terminal band 4.1 JEF domain, a central kinase domain, and a C-terminal so-called focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain (22Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 23Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 751-769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon integrin binding to ECM, FAK is autophosphorylated on tyrosine residue 397, which is a docking site for the SH2 domain of Src family kinases as well as PI 3-kinase (22Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). As a consequence of Src binding other tyrosine residues of FAK, including Tyr576 and Tyr925, are phosphorylated resulting in increased kinase activity of FAK and additional docking of other (cytoskeleton-associated) adapter and signaling molecules (22Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). This coordinated activation of FAK is critical in diverse cellular processes such focal adhesion formation/turnover, cell spreading and migration, cell proliferation, and control of apoptosis (15Van de Water B.

There is increasing evidence that FAK is involved in protection against apoptosis, in particular anoikis. For example, overexpression of constitutively active FAK prevents anoikis of epithelial cells (28Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. ChanHui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microinjection of peptides that compete for FAK-integrin association, and also antibodies directed against FAK itself, can induce apoptosis in fibroblasts that are not yet fully spread (29Hungerford J.E. Compton M.T. Matter M.L. Hoffstrom B.G. Otey C.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment of tumor cells with FAK antisense oligonucleotides or overexpression of deletion mutants of FAK that only contain the FAT domain and compete for function of endogenous FAK leads to rounding up of cells followed by apoptosis (18Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 30Xu L.H. Yang X.H. Craven R.J. Cance W.G.

During apoptosis caused by a wide variety of stimuli FAK is cleaved in a caspase-dependent manner (15Van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13328-13337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Wen L.P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17102-17108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This FAK cleavage is seen in both adherent and non-adherent cell lines. FAK cleavage results in a C-terminal fragment that contains the FAT domain and lacks the central catalytic domain of FAK (34Gervais F.G. Thornberry N.A. Ruffolo S.C. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17102-17108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This fragment resembles the protein focal adhesion kinase-related non-kinase (FRNK) that acts as a dominant negative of FAK and blocks FAK localization to focal adhesion as well as its phosphorylation (25Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 34Gervais F.G. Thornberry N.A. Ruffolo S.C. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17102-17108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, formation of this C-terminal fragment of FAK during apoptosis may block the anti-apoptotic function of endogenous FAK (34Gervais F.G. Thornberry N.A. Ruffolo S.C. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17102-17108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although the above data indicate an important role for FAK in anoikis, the role of FAK in chemically induced apoptosis is less well understood. Sonoda et al. (35Sonoda Y. Matsumoto Y. Funakoshi M. Yamamoto D. Hanks S.K. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16309-16315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of FAK in HL60 cells inhibits apoptosis caused by hydrogen peroxide and etoposide; however, these cells were non-adherent and had very low expression levels of endogenous FAK. In addition, the same group demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide caused increased phosphorylation of endogenous FAK in T98G cells, which was related to protection against apoptosis (36Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. YokotaAizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Sonoda Y. Watanabe S. Matsumoto Y. Aizu-Yokota E. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, these studies were also performed with suspended cells that lack normal focal adhesion complexes. Moreover, in these suspended T98G cells FAK phosphorylation levels are negligible, as expected (36Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. YokotaAizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus it still is unknown whether endogenous FAK in adherent cells (the physiological situation) is critical for the control of chemically induced apoptosis and whether this is directly related to changes in the focal adhesion organization. Moreover, since many chemicals depending on the treatment conditions cause both necrosis and apoptosis, it remains unclear whether there is a difference in regulation of apoptosis and necrosis by FAK. These issues are part of the present investigations. For this purpose we used renal proximal tubular epithelial cells exposed to nephrotoxicants as a model. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTCs) are an important target for a variety of nephrotoxic medicines, chemicals, and environmental pollutants as well as ischemia/reperfusion injury (38Brady H.R.

DCVC is metabolized by a cysteine conjugate β-lyase to a reactive acylating metabolite that covalently modifies cellular macromolecules (48Chen Q. Jones T.W. Brown P.C. Stevens J.L. J. Biol.

DCVC induces both necrosis and apoptosis of PTC, depending on the treatment conditions (15Van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol.

Kruidering M. Nagelkerke J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F593-F603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This apoptosis of PTC is preceded by dissolution of focal adhesion complexes in association with dephosphorylation of FAK (15Van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13328-13337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 54Van de Water B. Zoeteweij J.P. de Bont H.J.G.M. Mulder G.J. Nagelkerke J.F. J. Biol.

These events are independent of caspase activation and, importantly, occur well before the onset of caspase-3 activity (15Van de Water B. Nagelkerke J.F. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13328-13337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Based on these findings and the literature data, we proposed that the loss of FAK activity after toxicant treatment is important for perturbations of focal adhesions organization as well as FAK-mediated cell survival signaling. To study this we created renal epithelial cell lines that stably overexpress dominant negative acting FAK deletion mutants, FAT and FRNK. Overexpression of these constructs did not block formation focal adhesion but interfered with endogenous FAK localization and phosphorylation at focal adhesions. The data indicate a role for endogenous FAK in the control of chemically induced apoptosis but not necrosis. This seems directly related to the role of FAK in focal adhesion organization and tyrosine phosphorylation of the FAK-associated adapter protein paxillin. These data show for the first time a role for FAK in the control of chemically induced apoptosis in adherent epithelial cells. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, G418, penicillin/streptomycin, and trypsin/EDTA were from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine serum albumin fraction V, insulin, AMC, doxorubicin, and cisplatin were from Sigma. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone was from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Acyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) was from Research Biochemicals Int. (Natick, MA). pEGFP expression plasmids (CLONTECH) encoding FAK, and the FAK deletion mutants FAT and FRNK coupled to green fluorescent protein (GFP) were kindly provided by Dr. Ilic (see Ref. 18Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar for detailed description of the constructs). Myc-FAK was kindly provided by Dr. Hanks. DCVC was synthesized as described (48Chen Q. Jones T.W. Brown P.C. Stevens J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21603-21611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The porcine renal epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 was from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) and used between passages 201 and 213. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (complete medium) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide. For preparation of stable cell lines, LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of DNA of pEGFP, pEGFP-FAK, pEGFP-FAT, or pEGFP-FRNK using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's procedures (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transfectants were selected using 800 μg/ml G418. Individual clones were picked and maintained in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml G418. Clones were further analyzed for the expression of the various GFP chimeras using both flow cytometry, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. For further experiments for each construct 2–4 individual stable cell lines were used. For some experiments pkGFP and pkGFP-FAT clones were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged FAK in a similar fashion as for the stable transfections. For cytotoxicity experiments, cells were plated in 15-cm dishes (2·106 cells) and grown to subconfluence in 3 days. Thereafter, cells were trypsinized and plated in collagen-coated 10- or 6-cm dishes at a density of 0.5–1.105cells/cm2 in complete culture medium either with or without 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. In some experiments cells were plated in 24-well dishes containing coated glass coverslips (Corning Costar, Acton, MA). Cells were allowed to adhere and spread overnight. Cells were treated with DCVC in Hanks' balanced salt solution (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 0.4 mmNa2HPO4·2H2O, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 4 mm NaHCO3, 25 mm HEPES, 5 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4) in the presence of the antioxidant diphenyl-phenylenediamine (DPPD; 10 μm), which prevents necrosis, for 6 h followed by recovery in complete medium containing 10 μm DPPD. In some experiments cells were treated with doxorubicin or cisplatin in complete culture medium without fetal bovine serum. For determination of cell proliferation cells were plated in 24-well dishes at a density of 3·104 cells/well, and complete culture medium was changed every day. At indicated times wells were rinsed twice with PBS, and after removal of PBS the culture plates were frozen at −20 °C. After thawing 200 μl of MilliQ water was added followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. After freezing at −80 °C followed by thawing, to 50 μl of sample 50 μl of 20 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in TNE (10 mm Tris, 2 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) was added, and fluorescence was measured using a plate reader (HTS 7000, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Calf thymus DNA (Sigma) dissolved in TNE was used as a standard. Cell number was expressed as amount DNA/well. Apoptosis was determined by cell cycle analysis as described (18Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Briefly, floating and adherent cells that were trypsinized were pooled and subsequently fixed in 90% ethanol (−20 °C). After washing cells twice with PBS, 1 mm EDTA cells were resuspended in PBS/EDTA containing 7.5 μmpropidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNase A. After 30 min incubation at room temperature the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS-Calibur, Becton Dickenson), and the percentage of cells present in sub-G0/G1 was calculated using the Cellquest software (Becton Dickenson). In some experiments apoptosis was determined by staining with fluorescent-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide. Briefly, floating as well as adherent cells that were trypsinized were pooled and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 ×g. Pelleted cells were resuspended and allowed to recover for 30 min in complete culture medium. Thereafter, cells were centrifuged again for 5 min at 500 × g and resuspended in 100 μl of annexin-V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 1.8 mmCaCl2·2H2O, pH 7.4) containing allophycocyanin-conjugated annexin-V followed by incubation on ice for 15 min. After addition of 100 μl of binding buffer containing 10 μm propidium iodide, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells that were either annexin-V-positive and propidium iodide-negative (AV+/PI−; i.e. apoptotic cells) or annexin-V-positive and propidium iodide-positive (AV+/PI+;i.e. necrotic cells) was calculated using the Cellquest software. Necrotic cell death was measured by the release of LDH from cells in the culture medium as described (47Van de Water B. Tijdens I.B. Verbrugge A. Huigsloot M. Dihal A.A. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. Mulder G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25805-25813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The percentage of cell death was calculated from the amount of LDH release caused by treatment with toxicants relative to the amount to that released by 0.1 w/v Triton X-100, i.e.100% release. Caspase activity was assayed as follows. Briefly, attached and detached cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation as above. The cell pellet was taken up in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) and subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing. Equal amounts of cell proteins were used in a caspase assay using Ac-DEVD-AMC (25 μm; Research Biochemicals Int.) as a substrate. Fluorescence derived from release of the AMC moiety was followed using a fluorescence plate reader (HTS 7000; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Caspase activity was calculated as pmol/mg cell protein·min using AMC as a standard. For Western blot analysis cells were scraped in ice-cold TSE (10 mm Tris, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) plus inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and"

ESDN is a type-I transmembrane protein with the longest cleavable secretory signal sequence among eukaryotes. ESDN contains a CUB domain and a coagulation factor V/VIII homology domain, which reminds us of the structure of neuropilins. ESDN also harbors an LCCL domain, which is shared by Limulus factor C and Coch. Mouse and rat counterparts were also identified revealing >84% amino acid identity with human ESDN. The human ESDN gene was mapped between D3S1552 and D3S1271. Northern blot analysis showed that ESDN mRNA was expressed in various tissues; particularly highly expressed in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. The ESDN expression was up-regulated in platelet-derived growth factor-BB-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro and neointima of the balloon-injured carotid artery in vivo. Overexpression of ESDN in 293T cells suppressed their bromodeoxyuridine uptake. In addition, ESDN protein was strongly expressed in nerve bundles in rodents. Thus, ESDN is considered to play a role in regulation of vascular cell growth and may have a wide variety of functions in other tissues including the nervous system, like neuropilins.

Its disturbance is the bases of many human diseases including ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and many renal disorders. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus all impair vascular integrity through the acceleration of atherosclerosis. Even tumor growth and metastasis require the development of new blood vessel growth (1Hanahan D. Folkman J.

In the field of cardiovascular medicine, much therapeutic advance was made through the introduction of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for coronary heart disease which is one of the leading causes of human morbidity and mortality. Successful interventions, however, are followed by 20 to 50% of restenosis within 6 months (2Leimgruber P.P. Roubin G.S. Hollman J. Cotsonis G.A. Meier B. Douglas J.S. King S.B. Gruentzig A.R.

Despite significance in human disorders, the basic study of the vascular system lagged behind those of the immune and the nervous system, whose initial major works were achieved by cell biological or anatomical approach. The introduction of molecular biological methods have changed such situations, and much progress has been made through the study of extracellular signal transducing molecules.

One of these, ESDN, is a novel type-I transmembrane protein, has a characteristic domain structure reminding us of neuropilins, and will be described here. Human angiotensin II (AT-II), human recombinant PDGF-BB, and fetal calf serum (FCS) were purchased from Sigma, Life Technologies, and JRH Biosciences, respectively. Genomic DNAs of cow, rabbit, and Drosophila were purchased from CLONTECH, and that of yeast from Promega. The other genomic DNAs were isolated as previously described (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Primary culture of normal human coronary artery endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA), cultured in EGM-2-MV or SmGM-2 (BioWhittaker) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and used between passages 5 and 8. To co-culture them, an equal number of endothelial and smooth muscle cells were mixed and maintained in EGM-2-MV for 2 days before RNA extraction. For smooth muscle cell stimulation experiments, they were serum-starved in DMEM supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine for 48 h before the medium was exchanged to DMEM + 2 mml-glutamine with or without PDGF-BB, AT-II, or FCS of indicated concentrations. Mouse cell lines, A9(Neo3) and A9(Neo12), were purchased from JCRB Cell Bank and cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS. HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM + 10% FCS. Rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells were prepared by the explant method (39Ross R. Glomset J. Kariya B. Harker L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1207-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) and used between passages 5 and 8. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol or TRIzol LS (Life Technologies, Inc.). Oligotex(dT)30 Super (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for the purification of poly(A)+ RNA. The first strand cDNA for the ordinary or quantitative RT-PCR was synthesized from total RNA using the SuperScript Preamplification System for First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNAs from human coronary artery endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and their co-cultured cells were used for the construction of the cDNA libraries, and the yeast signal sequence trap screening was carried out as described previously (40Jacobs K.A. Collins-Racie L.A. Colbert M. Duckett M. Golden-Fleet M. Kelleher K. Kriz R. LaVallie E.R. Merberg D. Spaulding V. Stover J. Williamson M.J. McCoy J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods were performed using the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH). Coding sequences except the 5′ most region of mouse and rat were obtained with RT-PCR using two kinds of primer pairs based on human sequence data: 5′-CTGCTCCAACTCCTCCTCCTTC-3′ and 5′-CTGCTTCATTCCTTTCCACCAACCTG-3′; 5′-TGTGCTGGTCATGGTCCTCACTACTCTC-3′ and 5′-TGTGCTTTAAAACGATGCTTTG-3′. The N-terminal region of cDNA (nucleotide 453 to 800 of GenBankTM accession number AF387548) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP was used for subsequent mouse genomic library screening with Lambda FIX II library (Stratagene). A sense primer of 5′-CTGGCCGCTCATTGGTCTCAGC-3′ located on the obtained genomic sequence was paired with an antisense primer of 5′-GGATGTAAGGGTTCCACTCTCAGG-3′ situated in the downstream exon to acquire the first methionine-containing coding region of mouse ESDN. The above sense primer was replaced with another one, 5′-GCACTATGCGGGCGGATTGC-3′, for cloning the first methionine-containing region of human and rat ESDNs. Handling of all the nucleotide and amino acid sequence data and the construction of hydrophobicity profiles were performed with GenetyxMac Version 9.0 (Software Development Co., Ltd.). Sequence alignment was executed with MacVector (Oxford Molecular Group). BLAST and FASTA searches were performed at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi and www.fasta.genome.ad.jp/ideas/fasta/fasta_nr-aa.html, respectively. Motif search was done at www.motif.genome.ad.jp/. Prediction of signal peptides and transmembrane regions were based on the methods previously reported (41Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar, 42Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-CUB and anti-FV/VIII polyclonal antibodies were raised against keyhole limpet homocyanin-conjugated polypeptides of GERIRIKFGDFDIEDSD and QDKIFQGNKDYHKDVRNN, respectively, and affinity purified against each polypeptide by Sawady Technology. Western analysis was carried out following the ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Renaissance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) Western blot protocols. The other primary antibodies used are anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and His-probe H-15 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). Human ESDN constructs of hESDN-FL, -ΔEC, or -ΔCy were cloned into pEF6V5-His (Invitrogen) with swapping the original V5 epitope to the FLAG tag. Mouse ESDN constructs of mESDN-Ex(Edns) or -Ex(CD5) were cloned into pCAGGS (43Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar). An amino acid sequence of human CD5 is MPMGSLQPLATLYLLGMLVASVLA. These expression vectors were transfected into 293T and COS7 cells with CellPhect (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively, following their protocols. Transfected COS7 cells were stained essentially as described (44Tanigaki K. Nogaki F. Takahashi J. Tashiro K. Kurooka H. Honjo T. Neuron. 2001; 29: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Used secondary antibodies were Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories). Human ESDN (nucleotide 193–585 of GenBankTM accession number AF387547), rat ESDN (332–830 of GenBankTMAF387549) and rat GAPDH (459–1001 of GenBankTMM17701) cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used as a probe for Northern and Southern analyses. Southern zooblot was washed with 1 × SSC at 37 °C. The other blots were all washed with 0.2 × SSC at 65 °C. Fourteen- to fifteen-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (50 mg/kg), and the endothelium of the left common carotid artery was denuded with a 2F Fogarty embolectomy catheter (Baxter Healthcare), as previously described (17Furukawa Y. Matsumori A. Ohashi N. Shioi T. Ono K. Harada A. Matsushima K. Sasayama S. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 306-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The carotid arteries were harvested at 0, 5, or 14 days after balloon injury and used for quantitative RT-PCR analysis or immunohistochemistry. The latter procedure was performed as previously described (45Ohashi N. Matsumori A. Furukawa Y. Ono K. Okada M. Iwasaki A. Miyamoto T. Nakano A. Sasayama S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2521-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cold 4% paraformaldehyde was used for perfusion-fixation; and as primary antibodies, rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies at a concentration of 5–10 μg/ml or the same concentration of normal rabbit IgG (DAKO) for negative controls were used. The mRNAs for human or rat ESDN and GAPDH were measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using PE Applied Biosystems Prism Model 7700 Sequence Detection System. The nucleotide sequences of the dye-conjugated probe, forward and reverse primers are as follows: ESDN probe, 5′-(6-FAM)-CCTGAGAGTGGAACCCTTACATCCATAAAC-(TAMRA)-3′; ESDN forward, 5′-CCCAGCAAGGTGATGGATG-3′; ESDN reverse, 5′-CAAGAATCAGAATCTTCAATGTCAAAG-3′. These were based on the human sequence, but were confirmed to be applicable in quantitative measurements of rodent transcripts as well. TaqMan GAPDH Control Reagents and TaqMan Rodent GAPDH Control Reagents (PE Biosystems) were used for measurements of human and rat GAPDH, respectively. Standard curves were prepared from known amount of plasmids with ESDN or GAPDH amplicon subcloned into pBlueScript SK(−) (Stratagene), and the ESDN mRNA level normalized to that of GAPDH was used for further analyses. 293T cells were transfected by CellPhect (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the manufacturer's instructions. After 12 h of incubation with transfection solution, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM + 10% FCS and incubated for 2 h, trypsinized, and replated to 96-well plates in duplicate. For one plate, a 2-h BrdUrd pulse was applied after 24 h of culture and incorporated BrdUrd was measured by Cell Proliferation ELISA, BrdUrd (colorimetric) (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's instructions. The other plate was used to estimate the cell number with tetrazolium/formazan assay using Premix WST-1 assay kit (TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Shiga, Japan) 2 h after replating. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed by a paired t test with itsp value corrected according to the Bonferroni's method. Normalization of mean1 ± S.E.1(n = N) to mean2 ± S.E.2(n = N) was performed as follows: normalized mean = mean1/mean2, normalized S.E. = (mean1/mean2) × [{(S.E.1/mean1)2 + (S.E.2/mean2)2}/N](1/2). In this case, the number of degrees of freedom ranges from N-1 to 2x(N-1) depending on the variances (this calculation can be performed with the Smith-Satterthwaite procedure), but we always assumed it to be N-1, which is the most conservative estimate for yielding statistical significance in subsequent analyses. The three types of cDNA libraries constructed from primary culture of human coronary artery endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and their 2-day co-cultures yielded 3.2 × 106 Escherichia coli transformants, which were screened by the yeast signal sequence trap method described previously (40Jacobs K.A. Collins-Racie L.A. Colbert M. Duckett M. Golden-Fleet M. Kelleher K. Kriz R. LaVallie E.R. Merberg D. Spaulding V. Stover J. Williamson M.J. McCoy J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Five thousand positive clones were obtained and all the base sequences were determined with redundant clones being removed by dot-blot hybridization. More than 90 different genes were identified; >10 of them were novel genes. One such clone derived from the co-culture library contained a CUB domain, which is found in an increasing number of secretory or transmembrane proteins with various functions (46Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), and was selected for a further study. As the clones obtained by the signal sequence trap screening held only part of 5′-untranslated region and portion of the coding region, 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were performed to isolate the full-length cDNA. We also isolated mouse and rat counterparts by RT-PCR based on human sequence data. Alignment of human, mouse, and rat amino acid sequences deduced from their nucleotide sequences showed more than 84% amino acid identity between human and rodents, but revealed that the first methionine of human gene obtained by the signal sequence trap method was not conserved in rodents. Extensive 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends could not reach the definitive first methionine in any species. High GC content in the 5′ region of ESDN (data not shown) could cause a high-order structure of mRNA hindering the performance of a reverse transcription in addition to the difficulty in PCR reaction. Therefore, we conducted a genomic library screening, which is dependent on neither process. Screening of a 1.2 × 106 mouse phage genomic library yielded two positive clones, and the determinated base sequence of the neighborhood of probe-hybridizing region revealed a candidate for the first methionine with an upstream stop codon. A sense primer was designed 5′ side of this stop codon and paired with an antisense primer in the downstream exon to yield genuine RT-PCR product without an intron. Using human or rat RT-PCR templates, another primer pair covering mouse first methionine could also yield counterparts of these species. Alignment of three products showed conservation of the location of the first methionine which agreed very well with the Kozak consensus site (data not shown) (47Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4161) Google Scholar). The overall primary structure was also well conserved (Fig. 1 A), with an amino acid identity between human and rodents and between mouse and rat is 84–85 and 92%, respectively. Hydrophobicity profiles (Fig.2 A) of a novel clone showed an atypically long secretory signal sequence (a further analysis will be described below) and one transmembrane region, suggesting that it is a type-I transmembrane protein. A motif search revealed that the novel clone has two domains, a CUB domain and a coagulation factor V/factor VIII homology (FV/VIII) domain. This domain structure reminds us of neuropilins, which is a type-I transmembrane protein composed of two CUB domains, two FV/VIII domains, and one MAM domain in its extracellular portion (Fig. 1 B). Based on the source and this structural similarity, we named this novel clone ESDN (endothelial and smooth muscle cell-derived neuropilin-like molecule). A sequence homology search of the other area revealed that the region between the CUB and FV/VIII domains has significant homology with Coch (48Robertson N.G. Khetarpal U. Gutierrez-Espeleta G.A. Bieber F.R. Morton C.C. Genomics. 1994; 23: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and Limulus factor C (49Muta T. Miyata T. Misumi Y. Tokunaga F. Nakamura T. Toh Y. Ikehara Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6554-6561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region has been recently recognized and named as an LCCL module (50Trexler M. Banyai L. Patthy L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5751-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The LCCL domain was not pointed out in the original paper reporting Lgl-1 (51Kaplan F. Ledoux P. Kassamali F.Q. Gagnon S. Post M. Koehler D. Deimling J. Sweezey N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L1027-L1036PubMed Google Scholar), but Trexleret al. (50Trexler M. Banyai L. Patthy L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5751-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a single base insertion revealing that Lgl-1 contains two tandem LCCL domains. Alignment of these proteins showed the conservation of four cysteines in this domain (Fig. 1 C). 293T cells were transiently transfected with an expression vector containing the full-length human ESDN cDNA with a C-terminal FLAG tag (and a 6xHis tag) driven by the human elongation factor-1α promoter (Fig. 2 B). Cell lysate was analyzed by Western blot using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and two kinds of polyclonal antibodies raised against polypeptide within the CUB or the FV/VIII domain (bi-directional arrows in Fig.1 A). All three antibodies commonly recognized three sizes of protein bands, ∼127, 106, and 93 kDa (Fig. 2 C). These protein products were larger than the predicted molecular mass of 80 kDa, which was calculated from signal sequence-removed 709 amino acids plus 17 amino acids from the C-terminal FLAG and 6xHis tags. This size difference can be due to N-glycosylation, considering that 5–7 potential sites are there (Fig. 1 A). Because the predicted signal sequence of ESDN is very long and atypical in its hydrophobicity profile (Fig. 2 A), we analyzed the suitability of this point by two ways. First, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with human full-length ESDN cDNA, double-stained with anti-FLAG and anti-ESDN antibodies, and observed under a confocal laser microscope. Fig. 2 D confirmed the cell-surface expression of this protein. Then, we tried to confirm the location of a signal sequence cleavage site. The extracellular portion of mouse ESDN was recloned into an expression vector under the CAG promoter with the C-terminal 6xHis tag. We prepared another construct whose signal sequence was swapped with that of human CD5 (Fig.2 B). 293T cells were transiently transfected with these constructs, and culture media were analyzed by Western blot using the anti-6xHis antibody. Both constructs yielded the protein product of exactly the same size (Fig. 2 E). As the size difference of the signal sequences between human CD5 and mouse ESDN is 39 amino acid residues, corresponding approximately to a difference of 4 kDa, this result supports the same location of signal sequence cleavage sites. To characterize the evolutionary conservation ofESDN, a Southern zooblot analysis was performed with human ESDN probe (Fig. 3 A). In addition to strong bands observed in all mammals (mouse, rat, rabbit, cow, and human), weak bands were detected in Xenopus. No bands were observed in fly and yeast. BLAST search also revealed that there exist several ESTs from zebrafish (data not shown). Thus the conservation of ESDN is high in mammals, with extension to vertebrates. Search for STS in human ESDN sequence revealed that it contains two independent STS clones, stSG29921 and sts-D29024, which are mapped to D3S1603-D3S1271 and D3S1552-D3S1603, respectively (52Deloukas P.

We undertook gene expression analysis in Alport's syndrome mouse kidneys using microchip arrays to characterize the development of fibrosis. In addition to matrix and matrix-remodeling genes, consistent with interstitial fibrosis, macrophage-related genes show elevated expression levels in Alport's syndrome kidneys. Immunohistochemical analysis of kidney sections illustrated that macrophages as well as myofibroblasts accumulate in the tubular interstitium. Deletion of α1 integrin results in decreased accumulation of both myofibroblasts and macrophages in the tubular interstitium in Alport's syndrome mice and delays disease progression. Transforming growth factor β antagonism, although reducing interstitial fibrosis, does not limit macrophage accumulation in the tubular interstitium and disease progression. In this study, we identified previously overlooked inflammatory events that occur in the tubulointerstitial region. We propose that in addition to the previously suggested role for the α1β1 integrin in mesangial expansion and abnormal laminin deposition, this integrin may be critical for monocyte accumulation that, in turn, may lead directly to renal failure.

Within the glomerulus, mesangial matrix expands, and there is increased deposition of extracellular matrix components, including collagen. Glomerular filtration and renal blood flow is increasingly impaired, tubules atrophy, and a general inflammatory response to the tissue damage ensues. The progressive loss of glomerular function terminates in tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The etiology of kidney fibrosis is many-fold, ranging from disease-associated secondary pathology,e.g. diabetic nephropathy, to autosomal mutations of basement membrane proteins. One such hereditary basement membrane disorder is Alport's syndrome, a result of mutations in the collagen4A5, collagen4A3, or collagen4A4 genes (1Barker D.E. Hostikka S.K. Zhou J. Show L.T.

Loss of any one of these three genes results in the absence of all three proteins due to their mandatory association to form the quaternary structure of collagen. This disease affects about 1 in 5000 humans (4Flinter F. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 34: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). There are several animal models for Alport's syndrome, one of which is a collagen 4A3 gene knockout in mouse (5Cosgrove D. Meehan D.T. Grunkemeyer J.A. Kornak J.M. Sayers R. Hunter W.J. Samuelson G.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2981-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 6Miner J.H. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This model is very useful for studying both the tissue pathology of the disease as well as the underlying gene expression changes that may drive the disease. It has been demonstrated that at least two biochemical pathways are involved in pathogenesis. The first pathway is TGF-β1-stimulated and has been well established in many other disease models as well (7Salomon G.D. Kasid A. Bernstein E. Buresh C. Director E. Norton J.A.

The α1β1 integrin is a major integrin receptor expressed on mesangial cells, and Cosgrove et al.(12Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P.

Focusing on glomerular pathogenesis, these authors demonstrated that mesangial expansion and podocyte foot process effacement are attenuated in Alport's animals lacking the α1β1 integrin. They suggested that the abnormal expression of laminin isoforms displaced proper podocyte foot process adhesion to the glomerular basement membrane (12Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C.

To further characterize the mechanisms of disease progression and to include the tubulointerstitial regions in our analysis, we undertook an investigation of gene expression using microchip arrays (13Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M., C., W. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat.

This approach permitted the quantitative analysis of the expression of ∼11,000 genes and expressed sequence tags. Changes in expression were monitored at two different time points of the disease in Alport's syndrome (col4A3−/−) mice, in Alport's syndrome mice that were also null for the α1 integrin gene, and in Alport's syndrome mice treated with a TGF-β antagonist. Organization of the genes whose expression profile changes in Alport's syndrome mice into families of similar biological function has allowed us to analyze the effects of α1β1 integrin on the progression of the disease and the relationship of the α1β1integrin pathway to that of TGF-β. In this study, we identify previously overlooked inflammatory events that occur in the tubulointerstitial region and propose that in addition to the suggested role for the α1β1 integrin in mesangial expansion and abnormal laminin deposition, this integrin may be critical for monocyte accumulation that, in turn, may lead directly to renal failure. The Alport's syndrome (col4A3 −/−) mice have been described previously (5Cosgrove D. Meehan D.T. Grunkemeyer J.A. Kornak J.M. Sayers R. Hunter W.J. Samuelson G.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2981-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These mice are on a 129 Sv/J background. Heterozygotes for the col4A3 mutation were bred to obtain both homozygous knockouts and wild-type littermates. The genotype of the mice was determined by PCR. In addition, at the time of sacrifice, urine samples were collected and analyzed for protein that is indicative of kidney failure to confirm the knockout genotype. At the desired age (4 or 7 weeks) mice were sacrificed, and kidneys were dissected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen or as described below for tissue sections. The col4A3−/−; α1−/− mice have also been described previously (12Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P. Amatucci A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1649-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and are on a 129 Sv background. Kidneys were collected as described above at 7 weeks of age. Murine TGF-βR-Fc (12Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P. Amatucci A. Kalluri R. Am. J.

Injections were continued twice weekly until they reached 7 weeks of age, at which time they were sacrificed. Kidneys from each animal were dissected and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation or as described below for tissue sections. A separate group of control animals that were wild-type littermates (col4A3+/+) were treated in an identical fashion. Six animals were originally included in each experimental group. After confirmation of genotype and phenotype, kidneys from five animals in each group were used for further experiments. Frozen kidney tissue was homogenized in Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 4 °C, and total RNA was extracted. The RNA was further purified with a Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Valencia, CA). RNA from each individual kidney was purified separately. Total RNA (5 μg) was pooled from five of each mouse type, i.e. 25 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized with an oligo(dT)24 primer with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site added to its 3′ end (Genset, La Jolla, CA) and SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). All of the cDNA obtained was subjected to in vitro transcription with biotinylated UTP and CTP (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). A total of 40 μg of the cRNA product was fragmented and combined with herring sperm DNA (0.1 mg/ml), control oligonucleotide bib2 (50 pm), and four control bacterial and phage cRNA (1.5 pm BioB, 5 pm BioC, 25 pm BioD, and 100 pm Cre) samples in hybridization buffer (100 mmMES, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20). These samples served as internal controls for target grid alignment and hybridization efficiency, as recommended by the target manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The cRNA mixtures were hybridized (200 μl) at 45 °C to a Mu11K GeneChip (Affymetrix) for 16 h. The same cRNA mixture was hybridized to the subA GeneChip and subB GeneChip on successive days. Each target array was washed and scanned (Hewlett-Packard, GeneArray scanner G2500A) according to the procedures outlined by the manufacturer. Expression data were initially analyzed with the GeneChip software (Affymetrix). Arrays were globally scaled to an average intensity of 2500. Each of the Alport's syndrome mouse chips (TGF-βR-Fc-treated col4A3−/−, untreated col4A3−/−, or col4A3−/−; α1−/−) and the wild-type TGF-βR-Fc-treated mouse chip was analyzed using the age-matched wild-type mouse chip as the biological base line. A value of 100 was assigned to all intensity measurements below 100 before differences between knockout and base-line intensities were calculated. Three parameters were used for analysis, average difference intensity change, difference call, and fold change. Gene expression levels that varied less than 4-fold relative to the biological base line or had a difference call of “no change,” as determined by the GeneChip algorithms, were considered unchanged. Further analysis was based on those genes whose expression levels changed between the Alport's syndrome (col4A3−/−) and the wild-type (col4A3+/+) mice. We chose all 420 genes that had an average intensity greater than 100 arbitrary units in either the knockout or the wild-type mice and whose intensity was at least 4-fold different between knockout and wild type. In this set of 420 genes, 23 genes were represented two or three times and gave similar expression results. We only further analyzed one representative of each gene, i.e. there were 393 unique genes whose expression levels changed. For example, collagen1A2 is represented by probe arrays Msa.2220.0 and X58251 on the Mu11K subB chip. At 7 weeks in the Alport's syndrome (col4A3−/−) miceversus the wild-type (col4A3+/+) mice, these probe arrays measured 31- and 20-fold increases in collagen 1A2 expression, respectively. Genes were further classified according to biological function using the established classification scheme of Adams et al. (16Adams MD et al.Nature. 1995; 377 Suppl. 6547: 3-174Google Scholar). They were clustered within categories using the GENE CLUSTER and TREEVIEW programs (17Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13235) Google Scholar). These clusters were used to group subsets of genes whose expression were affected by the α1deletion or TGF-βR-Fc treatment. Fresh kidneys were embedded in OCT (Tissue Tek) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections (5 μm) were cut and fixed in ice-cold acetone. After blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline, sections were stained with the antibodies anti-α-smooth muscle actin-Cy3, anti-CD11b-PE, rat anti-laminin β1 (Sigma; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA; Chemicon, Temecula, CA, respectively), and hamster anti-α1 integrin Ha31/8, which was conjugated with Alexa-488 (18de Fougerolles A. Sprague A. Nickerson-Nutter C. Chi-Rosso G. Rennert P. Gardner H. Gotwals P. Lobb R. Koteliansky V. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The anti-laminin antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Sections were mounted with MOWIOL (Calbiochem). Images were collected using the Openlab (Improvision, Lexington, MA) image analysis system interfaced with a Leica DMR fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera. Total RNA isolated as described above was reverse-transcribed (Superscript II, Life Technologies). PCR was performed on cDNA from individual mice on a TC-200 thermocycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). PCR reactions included primers for the amplification of a 541-base fragment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the genes of interest (TIMP-1, collagen 1A2, Rantes, and MCP-1). Samples were subjected to 27 rounds of PCR at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. PCR products were separated in a 2% agarose gel by electrophoresis and imaged with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes) staining on a Storm fluorescence imager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The relative amounts of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the gene of interest were determined by integration of the PCR bands using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). To identify genes whose expression changed as a result of kidney disease, we compared the transcript levels in the Alport's syndrome (col4A3−/−) mice to their wild-type littermates at 4 and 7 weeks. RNA from five animals was pooled in order to minimize biological variation. We used 4-fold changes in gene expression level as a conservative cut-off for significant changes. We then categorized the 393 differentially expressed genes into established classes according to biological function (16Adams MD et al.Nature. 1995; 377 Suppl. 6547: 3-174Google Scholar), following the strategy of Stanton et al. (19Stanton L.W. Garrard L.J. Damm D. Garrick B.l. Lam A. Kapoun A.M. Zheng Q. Protter A.A. Schreiner G.F. White R.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) for studying gene expression in response to myocardial infarction. Among these differentially expressed genes, 80 are expressed sequence tags or of unknown function. A summary representation of the known 313 classified genes is shown in Fig. 1 (a complete report of expression data is available on-line in supplemental Table I). At 4 weeks of age, we found that of the 393 differentially expressed genes, 8 genes were up-regulated in Alport's syndrome mice, and 3 were down-regulated (Fig. 1, first column). At 7 weeks of age, we found that of the 393, 234 genes were up-regulated in the Alport's syndrome mouse, and 151 were down-regulated (Fig. 1, second column). The significant difference in the number of genes whose expression changes between 4 and 7 weeks is consistent with the progression of kidney pathogenesis in the Alport's syndrome mice. Staining of kidney tissue for a marker of interstitial myofibroblasts, α-smooth muscle actin, demonstrates that between 4 and 7 weeks, myofibroblasts are accumulating in the tubulointerstitium (Figs.2, A and B). Thus, by 7 weeks, kidney pathology is advanced, and by 8.5 weeks, Alport's syndrome mice die of end-stage renal failure (12Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P. Amatucci A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1649-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Consistent with interstitial fibrosis and mesangial expansion, many matrix proteins show elevated expression levels at 7 weeks (Fig. 1, classified as Cell Structure Motility). These include collagens 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 15, laminins α5 and β3, and fibronectin. Remodeling genes typically associated with tissue fibrosis are also affected in the Alport's syndrome mouse at 7 weeks. For example, the protease and protease inhibitors MMP-1, TIMP-1 and PAI-1 and the growth factors endothelin-1 and insulin-like growth factors show large changes in gene expression ranging from 5 to 50-fold (Fig.1, classified under Protein Expression and Cell Signaling and Communication, respectively), and the expression levels of oxidative enzymes are perturbed, e.g. lysyl oxidase and amiloride-sensitive amine oxidase (Fig. 1,Metabolism). Thus, the large changes in matrix gene expression observed with the Affymetrix microarray technology are consistent with the pathological changes in protein composition observed in kidney fibrosis. In addition to matrix and matrix-remodeling genes, functional classification revealed two additional categories of genes that were heavily affected in the Alport's mouse, Metabolism (73 genes) and Cell/Organism Defense (70 genes) genes (Fig. 1). Both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are affected, e.g.the gene expression levels of enolase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, and galactocerebrosidase are decreased. The large number of genes in both categories suggests that the cellular composition of the tissue has changed significantly during the course of the disease. The enormous up-regulation of Cell/Organism Defense genes at 7 weeks, the majority of which (83%, Fig. 1, column 2) is immune-response-related, suggests that immune system cells,e.g. macrophages or lymphocytes, appear in the Alport's syndrome kidney. We stained kidney tissue with cell lineage markers for monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes, and T-lymphocytes. At 4 weeks, we observed that a small number of macrophages had begun to appear in the kidney (Fig. 2 E). At 7 weeks, an extensive population of macrophages (CD11b/Mac-1+) was present in the tubular interstitium (Fig. 2 F). Staining of wild-type controls indicated that few macrophages were detectable in healthy tissue (Fig.3D). Infiltrating T-cells (CD3+) or granulocytes (Gr-1+) were not observed in the Alport's syndrome kidneys (data not shown). We next investigated the effect of α1 integrin deletion on the expression of those genes whose levels were changed in the 7-week-old Alport's syndrome mice. We analyzed gene expression levels in the col4A3−/−;-α1−/− mice using age-matched wild-type (col4A3+/+) mice as the biological base line. Within each functional category, the fold changes observed (Fig. 1, column 3) were compared with the fold changes determined in the 4-week- and 7-week-old Alport's syndrome mice (Fig. 1, columns 1 and2). 75% of the 393 Alport's-related genes were maintained fully or partially at wild-type levels upon deletion of the α1 integrin from the Alport's syndrome mice. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the α1-sensitive genes include those for matrix proteins, metalloproteases, protease inhibitors, and growth factors as well as metabolic and cell defense genes. Matrix proteins including collagens 1, 2, 3, and 6, laminin α5 and β3, and fibronectin undergo large changes in transcript levels. For example, collagen 1A2 dropped from 20-fold higher than wild type in the 7-week-old Alport's syndrome mouse to 6-fold higher in the 7-week old col4A3−/−;-α1−/− mouse. Matrix remodeling was also affected significantly. Thus, α1 integrin deletion has a very global effect on matrix deposition. In addition to laminin α2 deposition, α1 integrin deletion inhibited the accumulation of collagens, fibronectin, and other laminin chains. TIMP-1 gene expression, which promotes extracellular matrix accumulation by inhibiting metalloprotease degradation of matrix in tissue, was reduced dramatically by α1 integrin deletion. Gene expression dropped from 54-fold in the 7-week-old Alport's syndrome mouse to 4-fold in the 7-week-old col4A3−/−;-α1−/− mouse. A similar change was observed for PAI-1, which inhibited tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase plasminogen activator, proteases necessary for activation of plasmin, although the amount of PAI-1 transcript in Alport's syndrome mice was not as high as that of TIMP-1. Plasmin is responsible for degradation of matrix proteins fibronectin and laminin as well as activation of collagenases and gelatinases. Thus, both the cascade for activation of metalloproteases as well as metalloprotease activities in tissue were inhibited in Alport's syndrome. Deletion of α1 integrin in Alport's syndrome reduced the levels of metalloprotease inhibitor mRNA transcripts to near wild-type levels, i.e. levels observed in a healthy kidney. This reduction in matrix and matrix remodeling genes is consistent with the decrease in myofibroblast accumulation in the interstitium observed in 7-week-old col4A3−/−;-α1−/− mice (Fig. 2 C). The monocyte/macrophage-derived genes also showed a decrease in transcript level upon α1 integrin deletion (Fig. 1 and on-line in Table I). For example, the transcript levels of JE (MCP-1), macrophage-inducible protein (IP-10), macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage mannose receptor, and F4/80 were elevated 24-, 6-, 13-, 20.9-, and 11.9-fold respectively, in the 7-week-old Alport's syndrome mice. In the 7-week-old col4A3−/−; α1−/− mice, their expression levels were maintained at wild-type levels. Furthermore, the transcript levels of Fc receptors, receptors present on the macrophage cell surface, are reduced from high (5–50-fold) levels to wild-type levels upon deletion of α1 integrin in Alport's syndrome mice. In addition, macrophage metalloelastase, and carboxypeptidase E proteases, which are secreted to clear tissue debris and facilitate migration of leukocytes into the tissue, have gene expression levels 19–27-fold above the wild-type base line in Alport's syndrome mice. Again, they are reduced to wild-type levels by α1 integrin deletion. Consistent with the reduced expression levels observed, infiltration by macrophages is reduced to levels seen in 4-week-old Alport's syndrome mice (Fig. 2 G). Thus, deletion of α1 integrin reduces the number or delays the appearance of both myofibrobasts and macrophages in the tubular interstitium in Alport's syndrome mice. The expression levels of 22 genes known to be TGF-β-inducible in other systems are restored to near wild-type levels by deletion of α1integrin (Fig. 1 and on-line in Table I). These genes encompass all functional categories, and include, in addition to the previously discussed matrix and matrix remodeling proteins, transcription factors, oxidative stress genes, and growth factors. Previously, it had been shown that, at 7 weeks of age, TGF-β1 expression is induced 4-fold in Alport's syndrome mice relative to wild-type mice (20Sayers R. Kalluri R. Rodgers K.D. Shield C.F.I. Meehan D.T. Cosgrove D. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1662-1673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and deletion of α1 integrin in Alport's syndrome mice prevented induction of TGF-β at 7 weeks of age. Because TGF-β promotes the progression of renal disease and fibrosis, we addressed how many of the gene expression changes associated with the loss of the α1 integrin were due to a loss of TGF-β activity. In addition, we wanted to elucidate the individual roles of TGF-β and α1 in this disease. Therefore, we investigated the effect of treatment with a murine soluble TGF-β type II receptor (TGF-βR-Fc) on gene expression (12Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P. Amatucci A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1649-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This receptor is an antagonist for TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 but not TGF-β2 (12Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P. Amatucci A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1649-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Alport's syndrome mice were treated with TGF-βR-Fc twice weekly from 3 weeks of age until they were sacrificed at 7 weeks of age. Expression of 62% of the 393 Alport's-related genes was restored or partially restored to wild-type levels upon treatment of Alport's syndrome mice with the TGF-βR-Fc (Fig. 1, column 4). This subset included 18 of the 22 genes identified as TGF-β-inducible (Fig. 1 and on-line in Table I). The expression levels of the other four TGF-β-inducible genes, COL1A1, tenascin, fibronectin, and c-Jun, are slightly reduced or unchanged upon treatment with TGF-βR-Fc. Furthermore, of the antagonist-affected genes, 95% are also affected by the α1 deletion. That is, only 11 genes that do not respond to removal of α1 integrin in the Alport's syndrome mice have altered expression levels upon treatment with TGF-βR-Fc. The transcript levels of matrix and matrix-remodeling proteins, transcription factors, and most growth factors are reduced upon antagonist treatment. However, there are many macrophage-related genes whose expression levels respond to α1 deletion but not TGF-β antagonism. For example, the expression levels of IP-10, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage mannose receptor, metalloelastase, and carboxypeptidase E are all relatively unchanged upon treatment with the TGF-β antagonist (Fig. 1, column 4, and on-line in Table I). When we looked for the presence of α-smooth muscle actin and CD11b-positive cells in the TGF-β antagonist-treated kidneys, we observed cell populations consistent with the transcript profile. In 7-week-old TGF-βR-Fc-treated Alport's Syndrome mice, accumulation of myofibroblasts in the interstitium was significantly decreased (Fig.2 D). However, macrophages are still present (Fig.2 H). Thus, treatment with a TGF-β antagonist reduces accumulation in the tubular interstitium in Alport's syndrome mice of myofibroblasts but not macrophages. Because deletion of α1 integrin was associated with a delay in macrophage appearance in Alport's syndrome mice, we investigated the localization of α1 integrin and macrophages over the time course of the disease. Kidney tissue from Alport's syndrome (col4A3−/−) mice was double-stained with anti-CD11b, a macrophage marker, and anti-α1 integrin antibodies. We examined sections at 1-week intervals from 4 to 8 weeks as well as a wild-type control. As previously reported, α1 integrin is present in healthy kidney on the mesangial cell surface (Fig. 3 A). However, there are very few macrophages in the healthy kidney (Fig.3 D). In the Alport's syndrome mice, α1integrin is also present on the mesangial cell surface (Fig.3 B). Beginning at ∼4 weeks, CD11b-positive macrophages begin to accumulate in the tubulointerstitium (Fig. 3 E) of Alport's syndrome mice. As the disease progresses, the number of macrophages accumulating progressively increases. By week 8, macrophages appear throughout the tubulointerstitium (Fig.3 F). Double-staining of the tissue with anti-α1 integrin antibody demonstrates that a substantial subset of the accumulated macrophages are α1integrin-positive (Figs. 3, H and I). Hence, the delay of macrophage accumulation in col4A3−/−; α1−/− mice is associated with the absence of α1 integrin on the macrophage surface in these knockout mice. Although the initial trigger or triggers for fibrosis are not known, the hallmarks of tissue fibrosis are well characterized. Cytokines promote growth of mesangial cells in the glomerulus and enhance release of extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin and collagen. The cytokines also stimulate accumulation of myofibroblasts in the tubulointerstitium. The myofibroblasts contain α-smooth muscle actin and are associated with accumulation of additional matrix proteins, e.g. collagen and fibronectin. In addition to a change in the quantity and composition of matrix proteins, remodeling of the matrix is affected in tissue fibrosis. In normal tissue, remodeling and turnover of the matrix proteins are balanced by metalloproteases and their inhibitors. In fibrotic tissue, increased levels of matrix metalloprotease inhibitors are observed, and the activities of matrix metalloproteases can be elevated or decreased (21Branton M.H. Kopp J.B. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The net result is increased matrix accumulation in the tubulointerstitium. Our gene expression profiling experiments demonstrate that these changes are associated with kidney fibrosis in an Alport's syndrome mouse model. In addition to genes for matrix and matrix-remodeling proteins, gene expression levels of immune-response genes are up-regulated. Tissue damage is normally associated with an inflammatory response that results in macrophage infiltration. Our immunohistochemistry results demonstrate, however, that the macrophage infiltration precedes accumulation of matrix. Moreover, both the gene profiling experiments and immunohistochemistry experiments clearly demonstrate that despite the reduction of interstitial fibrosis by TGF-β antagonism, macrophages accumulate in the renal tubular interstitium of Alport's syndrome mice. In contrast, α1integrin deletion reduces both fibrosis and macrophage accumulation. In a recent publication (12Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P. Amatucci A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1649-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), it was reported that loss of the α1 integrin significantly extended the lifetime of Alport's syndrome mice. On the other hand, TGF-β antagonism, although reducing glomerular and interstitial fibrosis, did not extend life. Because the α1β1 integrin is one of the major integrins expressed on the mesangial cell surface and may be involved in both mesangial expansion and signaling, Cosgrove et al. (12Cosgrove D. Rodgers K. Meehan D. Miller C. Bovard K. Gilroy A. Gardner H. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P. Amatucci A. Kalluri R. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1649-1659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) focused their analysis on the glomerulus. These authors hypothesized that loss of α1 integrin expression on mesangial cells may result in aberrant expression of laminin isoforms that, in turn, result in podocyte effacement from the glomerular basement membrane and a loss of renal filtration. The combined transcript profiles and immunohistochemical analyses presented here suggest an alternative hypothesis that accumulation of monocytes in the tubular interstitium may lead to direct renal failure. One reason that TGF-β receptor-treated Alport's syndrome mice do not have an extended lifetime despite delayed interstitial fibrosis is that macrophage accumulation in the kidney is minimally altered. In contrast, macrophage accumulation in the kidney of α1integrin null Alport's syndrome mice is reduced. Tissue damage resulting from the pro-inflammatory cytokines may lead to death. Macrophages produce TGF-β, and the marked decrease in the expression of TGF-β-inducible genes in the α1 integrin null Alport's syndrome mice at 7 weeks is most likely due to the absence of macrophages in these mice. Although our experiments are specific to the Alport's syndrome model, the conclusions are applicable to fibrotic pathology resulting from many forms of progressive renal disease. Indeed, similar transcript profiles were identified in a murine model of lung fibrosis (20Sayers R. Kalluri R. Rodgers K.D. Shield C.F.I. Meehan D.T. Cosgrove D. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1662-1673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although ACE inhibitors are known to delay the progression of renal disease to end stage renal failure, no current therapy directly targets fibrosis. Thus, development of a therapy that targets the fibrotic process of the disease itself would be of immense clinical significance. It has been shown previously that blockade of the α1 integrin mitigates the inflammatory response in murine models of contact sensitivity, delayed-type hypersensitivity, and arthritis (18de Fougerolles A. Sprague A. Nickerson-Nutter C. Chi-Rosso G. Rennert P. Gardner H. Gotwals P. Lobb R. Koteliansky V. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Our data in the Alport's model of renal pathogenesis demonstrate that the α1 integrin is required for accumulation of monocytes in damaged tissue. Although present at low levels on resting monocytes (22Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), expression of α1integrin is up-regulated in macrophages upon cytokine activation (23Rubio M.A. Sotillos M. Jochems G. Alvarez V. Corbi A.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2701-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The α1 integrin is involved in cell proliferation (24Pozzi A. Wary K.K. Giancotti F.G. Gardner H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and leukocyte activation (25Miyake S. Sakurai T. Okomura K. Yagita H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2000-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of α1integrin on the cell surface may either directly inhibit migration and/or proliferation of macrophages or disrupt integrin-mediated macrophage activation. The presence of an immune response in a variety of fibrotic diseases suggests that α1 integrin may play a role in other fibrotic diseases as well. Thus, monocyte accumulation may be regulated by α1 integrin, and therapeutics aimed at blocking the function of the α1 integrin may be useful for treating diseases associated with chronic inflammation and fibrosis.

The receptor proteins are direct regulators of transcription that function by binding to specific DNA sequences named hormone response elements in promoters of target genes. Nearly all the superfamily members bind as dimers to DNA elements. Although some apparently bind only as homodimers, thyroid hormone receptors, vitamin D receptor, retinoic acid receptors (RARs),1 the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and several orphan nuclear receptors bind their specific response elements with high affinity as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors. Receptors have dimerization interfaces in both their DNA binding domain and ligand binding domain. The DNA binding domain interfaces are quite different for each receptor, whereas the ligand binding domain interface is primarily based on a conserved motif referred to as the ninth heptad or the I-box (2Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar). This motif is required for both heterodimerization and homodimerization of many nuclear receptors, including retinoid X receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, RAR, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (2Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lee S.-K. Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J. Soh J. Choi H.-S. Lee J.W. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33522-33526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Small heterodimer partner (SHP) is an orphan nuclear receptor specifically expressed in liver and a limited number of other tissues, and its activities are in some ways opposite to those of retinoid X receptor (5Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). SHP, like the orphan nuclear receptor DAX-1 (for review, see Ref. 6Burris T.P. Guo W. McCabe E.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 241-260PubMed Google Scholar), lacks the conventional DNA binding domain. Both direct biochemical and the yeast two-hybrid results demonstrated that SHP interacts with many members of the receptor superfamily (5Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). As expected from its lack of a DNA binding domain, addition of SHP inhibited in vitro DNA binding by nuclear receptors with which it interacted, and in mammalian cell cotransfections, SHP repressed their transactivation. In addition, the SHP sequences required for interaction with other superfamily members have recently been localized to the central portion of SHP (7Seol W. Chung M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7126-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), distinct from the I-box (2Perlmann T. Umesono K. Rangarajan P.N. Forman B.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 958-966PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lee S.-K. Na S.-Y. Kim H.-J. Soh J. Choi H.-S. Lee J.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4Lee S.-K.

Macrophages are thought to play critical pathogenic roles in several chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis (for review, see Ref. 8Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar). The formation of an atherosclerotic lesion is a complex process involving intracellular lipid accumulation and various signal transduction pathways in vascular cells, such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and monocytes/macrophages. Each vascular cell is capable of oxidatively modifying low density lipoprotein (LDL) to generate oxidized LDL (oxLDL) (for review, see Ref. 9Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20963-20966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Circulating monocytes adhere to activated endothelium, migrate into intima, and subsequently differentiate into macrophages that express various scavenger receptor genes. Accumulation of oxLDL through scavenger receptors mediates the formation of foam cells from macrophages and consequently fatty streaks, the earliest visible lesions of atherosclerosis. The oxidative modification results in a number of important biological activities of LDL, including the induction of a number of genes encoding cytokines and growth factors (10Hamilton T.A. Major J.A. Chisolm G.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2020-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Among the growth factors and cytokines that are secreted from vascular cells, a regulatory network is thought to exist, and a lesion may result from their collective action. Cross-talk between transcription factors of distinct families is an important phenomenon in regulating gene transcription and has recently become the subject of intensive investigation. In particular, the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) has been shown to functionally interact with numerous other transcription factors, including members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (for review, see Ref. 11McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in mutually repressed biological activity of these transcription factors. These include glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and androgen receptor (11McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, PPARγ and RAR/retinoid X receptor were also added to the list of nuclear receptors functionally interacting with NFκB (12Han C.Y. Park S.Y. Pak Y.K. Biochem.

NFκB, composed of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of members of the Rel (NFκB) family of polypeptides, is important for the inducible expression of a wide variety of cellular and viral genes (for review, see Ref. 16Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, this family comprises p50, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, p52, and RelB. These proteins share a 300-amino acid region, known as the Rel homology domain, that binds to DNA and mediates homo- and heterodimerization. This domain also is the target of various IκB inhibitors. In the majority of cells, NFκB exists in an inactive form in the cytoplasm, bound to the inhibitory IκB proteins. Treatment of cells with various inducers results in the degradation of IκB proteins. The bound NFκB is released and translocates to the nucleus where it activates appropriate target genes. In this study, we identified SHP as a novel transcription coactivator of NFκB. We have further presented the experimental results indicating that the modulation of SHP expression appears to function as a distinct regulatory component of the transcriptional activities of NFκB in oxLDL-treated, resting macrophage cells. These results could have an important implication for the differentiation mechanism of resting macrophage cells into foam cells and resulting atherogenesis. Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) and oxLDL were prepared from the plasma of healthy volunteers as described previously (12Han C.Y. Park S.Y. Pak Y.K. Biochem.

The mammalian expression vectors for p65, SHP, HA-SHP, and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1); the LexA, bib42, T7, or GST vectors to express SHP, p65, p65N, p50, SRC-C, SRC-D, SRC-E, and RAR; the transfection indicator construct pRSV-β-gal; and the reporter constructs κB-LUC and PPRE-LUC were as previously described (5Seol W.

Palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma. For the yeast two-hybrid tests, plasmids encoding LexA fusions and bib42 fusions were cotransformed intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae EGY48 strain containing theLacZ reporter plasmid SH/18-34 (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., New York1995Google Scholar). Liquid assays of β-galactosidase expression were carried out as described previously (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., New York1995Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in more than two similar experiments. The GST fusions or GST alone was expressed in Escherichia coli, bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated with either cell lysates cotransfected with HA-SHP expression vector or labeled proteins expressed by in vitrotranslation by using the TNT-coupled Transcription-Translation System with conditions as described by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). Specifically bound proteins were eluted from beads with 40 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., New York1995Google Scholar). To introduce serial deletions into p65, the p65 expression vector was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes before being subjected to the TNT-coupled Transcription-Translation System. RAW 264.7, HeLa, and CV-1 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (Life Technologies, Inc.). For transfections, cells were grown in six-well plates with medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and transfected with the indicated plasmid(s) by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (12Han C.Y. Park S.Y. Pak Y.K. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The total amounts of expression vectors were kept constant by adding the CDM8 expression vector to transfections. After 24 h, cells were washed and incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the absence or presence of either oxLDL or other reagent(s). Cells were harvested after the indicated time periods, luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay kit (Promega), and the results were normalized to the LacZ expression. Total RNA from cell monolayers was isolated using guanidinium isothiocyanate and phenol (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA (20 μg) was separated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT membranes (Bio-Rad) in 10× SSC buffer (1.5m NaCl, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m EDTA) by capillary action. Blots were hybridized with the 32P-labeled SHP probe for 16 h at 65 °C in 250 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2 and 7% SDS. After washing twice in 20 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2 and 5% SDS at 65 °C for 45 min and once in 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2 and 1% SDS for 45 min at 65 °C, the blots were analyzed by exposure to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C. The 1.5-kilobase probe for 28 S rRNA (ATCC no. 77235) was used for normalization of expression. Protein extracts from oxLDL-treated RAW264.7 cells or HeLa cells cotransfected with HA-SHP expression vector were prepared with lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100), separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Western blot using HA-monoclonal and goat anti-murine PPARγ polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After detection of PPARγ, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For RT-PCR analyses, total cDNA synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA was amplified for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The oligonucleotide primer set (5′-ACT CTG GAT TCA GCT GGT CG-3′ and 5′-GTT CAT GCT TGT GAA GGA TG-3′) was used for amplification of a 250-base pair fragment of SHP. The reaction products from the PCR were examined by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and normalized by comparison to the RT-PCR product for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Many nuclear receptors have been shown to functionally interact with NFκB (for review, see Ref. 11McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we examined whether the NFκB components p50 and p65 also interact with the unusual orphan nuclear receptor SHP. GST fusion to SHP interacted with radiolabeled p65 but not with luciferase or p50 (Fig.1 A, left). In addition, SHP interacted with SRC-1, a transcription coactivator of nuclear receptors and other transcription factors (for review, see Ref.23McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar) including NFκB (18Na S.-Y. Lee S.-K. Han S.-J. Choi H.-S. Im S.-Y Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10831-10834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Accordingly GST fusion to SHP specifically interacted with the radiolabeled C-terminal subregions of SRC-1 (i.e. SRC-D and SRC-E containing the SRC-1 residues 759–1141 and 1101–1441, respectively) (Fig. 1 A,left). It is noted that these regions are distinct from the region containing the previously shown receptor binding site (i.e. SRC-C consisting of the SRC-1 residues 568–779) that includes the nuclear receptor-interacting LXXLL motifs (24Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar,25Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) in which L and X denote leucine and any amino acid, respectively. Similar results were also obtained with the mammalian two-hybrid-based tests (results not shown). The SHP interaction interface was further mapped to the N-terminal 283 residues of p65 (Fig. 1 A, right). In addition, HeLa nuclear extracts cotransfected with HA-tagged SHP expression vector retained with GST fusion to p65 but not with GST alone contained SHP as demonstrated by Western analyses with HA-monoclonal antibody (Fig.1 B). Consistent with these results, bib42 fusion to the N-terminal domain of p65 (i.e. p65N consisting of the p65 residues 1–283), but not bib42 alone or bib42 fusion to p50, stimulated the LexA-SHP-mediated transactivation of the LacZ reporter construct controlled by upstream LexA binding sites (Fig.2 A, bottom). SHP also interacted with SRC-D and SRC-E but not with SRC-C in yeast (Fig.2 A), whereas RAR interacted with SRC-C as well as the C-terminal region of SRC-1 (i.e. SRC-E) as previously shown (23McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Confirming the functionality of these interactions, cotransfected SHP enhanced transactivation by NFκB in a dose-dependent manner either alone or in synergy with SRC-1 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, SHP efficiently suppressed transactivation by RAR as previously described (5Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and had no significant effect on transactivation directed by Gal4 fusion to VP16 (results not shown). These results clearly demonstrate that SHP directly interacts with p65 and is a positive transcriptional coregulator of NFκB. This positive regulatory role is in sharp contrast to the previously reported inhibitory role of SHP on a variety of receptor-dependent signaling pathways (5Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar).Figure 2SHP as a novel coactivator of NFκB. A, the indicated bib42 and LexA plasmids were transformed into a yeast strain containing an appropriate LacZ reporter gene as described previously (21Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Assoc., New York1995Google Scholar). The data are representative of at least two similar experiments, and the error bars are as indicated. B, HeLa cells were transfected with LacZ expression vector, expression vectors for p65, SHP, and SRC-1, and a reporter gene, κB-LUC, as indicated. Normalized luciferase expressions from triplicate samples were calculated relative to the LacZ expressions, and the results were expressed as -fold activation (n-fold) over the value obtained with the reporter alone. The data are representative of three similar experiments, and the error bars are as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SHP was previously demonstrated to be specifically expressed in liver and a limited number of tissues (26Lee H.K. Lee Y.K. Park S.H. Kim Y.S. Park S.H. Lee J.W. Kwon H.B. Soh J. Moore D.D. Choi H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14398-14402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). During our recent search for additional tissues or cell lines that may express SHP, we found that SHP mRNA is abundant in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Surprisingly this expression was significantly repressed by oxLDL, but not by native LDL (nLDL), in a time-dependent manner (Fig.3 A). However, the repression was not observed in the presence of the endocytosis blocker cytochalasin B (12Han C.Y. Park S.Y. Pak Y.K. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of oxLDL likely involves endocytosis of oxLDL. We have previously shown that 13-HODE, a constituent of oxLDL and a ligand for PPARγ, functions in an endocytosis-dependent manner (12Han C.Y. Park S.Y. Pak Y.K. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined if this inhibitory effect of oxLDL stemmed from its constituent 13-HODE. As shown in Fig. 3 C, 13-HODE was indeed responsible for the inhibitory effect of oxLDL. Troglitazone, a synthetic PPARγ ligand, also showed similar effects. In contrast, lysoPC, another constituent of oxLDL that transactivates NFκB (12Han C.Y. Park S.Y. Pak Y.K. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,27Sugiyama S. Kugiyama K. Ogata N. Doi H. Ota Y. Ohgushi M. Matsumura T. Oka H. Yasue H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), was without any effect. However, the oxLDL-mediated repressive effects were not recapitulated with a luciferase reporter construct directed by the previously described native SHP promoter (26Lee H.K. Lee Y.K. Park S.H. Kim Y.S. Park S.H. Lee J.W. Kwon H.B. Soh J. Moore D.D. Choi H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14398-14402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) in cotransfections of CV1 and RAW 264.7 cells (results not shown). Notably 13-HODE, in addition to its role as a direct ligand for PPARγ, may have a multitude of other effects as recently demonstrated for another PPARγ ligand 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 in inhibiting the NFκB transactivation (14Straus D.S. Pascual G. Li M. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Hsiang C.H. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Ghosh G. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 D, SHP mRNA from oxLDL-treated cells degraded much faster than nLDL-treated cells in the presence of the transcription blocker actinomycin D. Under this condition, the half-life of SHP mRNA in the presence of oxLDL was ∼1 h relative to 2 h with nLDL. Interestingly cycloheximide, a protein synthesis blocker, had no effect on the inhibitory action of oxLDL (results not shown), suggesting that new protein synthesis is not required for the repression. Overall these results strongly suggest that oxLDL suppresses SHP expression in resting macrophage cells likely through modulating its mRNA stability. SHP has previously been shown to down-regulate transactivation by nuclear receptors with which it interacts (5Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 7Seol W. Chung M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7126-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Johansson L.

Hadzopoulou-Cladaras H. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, however, SHP is apparently a transcriptional coactivator of NFκB. Notably SHP also interacted with PPARγ in the yeast two-hybrid tests (results not shown). Thus, we examined the effects of cotransfected SHP on either oxLDL-mediated transactivation of NFκB or PPARγ in CV1 cells. Surprisingly oxLDL did not readily enhance the NFκB transactivation unless SHP was coexpressed (Fig.4 A), suggesting the essentiality of SHP in the NFκB transactivation by oxLDL. Furthermore, SHP was an activator of both the basal and ligand-induced levels of PPARγ transactivation in CV-1 cells (Fig. 4 B) as opposed to its previously described inhibitory effects with other nuclear receptors (5Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 7Seol W. Chung M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7126-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J. Treuter E. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, it is not currently known if SHP could still be an activator of the PPARγ transactivation in RAW 264.7 cells. Consistent with an idea that SHP alone may not effectively stimulate the PPARγ transactivation in RAW 264.7 cells, the PPARγ transactivation level was relatively low during the early phase of oxLDL treatment in which SHP expression was still abundant (Fig.5). From these results, a putative repressor molecule of PPARγ, which is dominant over the stimulatory effect of SHP and suppressible by oxLDL, was predicted to exist in the resting RAW 264.7 cells. This issue is currently under intense investigation. Interestingly treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with oxLDL did not lead to significant changes in PPARγ expression (Fig.4 C) in contrast to the previously described results with THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells (30Ricote M. Huang J. Fajas L. Li A. Welch J. Najib J. Witztum J.L. Auwerx J. Palinski W. Glass C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7614-7619Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In addition, the previously described 13-HODE/PPARγ-mediated repression of the NFκB transactivation (12Han C.Y. Park S.Y. Pak Y.K. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) became impaired with the increasing amount of SHP expression vector (Fig. 4 D). The 13-HODE-dependent repression was readily observed only in the presence of 10 ng of cotransfected PPARγ. Under this condition, however, the -fold repression progressively decreased from ∼3 to 2 and 0 as the amount of SHP expression vector increased from 0 to 100 and 200 ng, respectively (Fig. 4 D). Considering all of these results together, the NFκB transactivation was expected to gradually diminish in oxLDL-treated RAW 264.7 cells as the SHP expression becomes repressed (Fig. 3). Indeed stimulation of the NFκB transactivation was readily observed with oxLDL or lysoPC for the initial 4–8 h after treatment, whereas lysoPC was much less effective and oxLDL and 13-HODE were rather repressive with the NFκB transactivation for the 12–24 h post-treatment (Fig. 5). In particular, the latter results likely result from the previously described PPARγ-mediated repression of the NFκB transactivation (12Han C.Y. Park S.Y. Pak Y.K. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which does not seem to operate when the SHP level is relatively high (Fig. 4 D). Currently it is not clear why the PPARγ transcriptional activities were much higher for the 12–24 h post-treatment generating a biphasic transition from the NFκB to PPARγ transactivation during oxLDL treatment, although the putative, oxLDL-suppressible repressor may initially exist in the resting RAW 264.7 cells as mentioned already. Overall these results suggest that the oxLDL-mediated down-regulation of SHP, coupled with the PPARγ-mediated repressive actions (12Han C.Y. Park S.Y. Pak Y.K. Biochem.

A, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with the indicated reporter constructs along with PPARγ expression vector (10 μg) andLacZ expression vector and treated for the indicated time periods with either vehicle only (ethanol), nLDL (100 μg/ml), oxLDL (100 μg/ml), lysoPC (10 μm), or 13-HODE (20 μg/ml). Normalized luciferase expressions from three independent experiments performed in triplicate samples are presented relative to theLacZ expressions, and the error bars are as indicated. B, our results suggest a model in which SHP serves as a transcriptional coactivator molecule of NFκB and PPARγ. In particular, SHP appears to be essential for the NFκB transactivation by oxLDL as indicated by a solid line. In addition, resting macrophage cells, like RAW 264.7 cells, may express a putative repressor molecule of PPARγ that is likely subjected to down-regulation by oxLDL and dominates over the stimulating activity of SHP on the PPARγ transactivation (see the text for further details).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LysoPC has been shown to induce the expression of cell adhesion molecules and growth factors and to induce macrophage proliferation (31Sugiyama S. Kugiyama K. Ohgushi M. Fujimoto K. Yasue H. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Because NFκB is usually involved with proliferation, this lysoPC-mediated proliferation of macrophages may involve its action with NFκB (27Sugiyama S. Kugiyama K. Ogata N. Doi H. Ota Y. Ohgushi M. Matsumura T. Oka H. Yasue H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly our preliminary results 2Y. K. Pak and C.-Y. Han, unpublished observations. indicated that the SHP protein level also drops in RAW 264.7 cells upon oxLDL treatment with a time dependence similar to its mRNA expression profile (Fig. 3), and human foam cells from atherogenic lesion did not express SHP at all. These results imply that, although the role of oxLDL-PPARγ in regulating macrophage differentiation is still unclear, an efficient shut-down of the NFκB transactivation may play a pivotal role in these processes. Thus, our results suggest the possibility of new therapeutic interventions in atherogenesis by targeting SHP for regulated expression or modulating transcriptional activities by identifying its putative ligands. More detailed studies with various monocytic cells will provide further details as to the action of SHP in these processes. Finally it is important to note that oxLDL treatment may also affect a variety of nuclear receptor-dependent signaling pathways in macrophages based on the previously defined modulatory role of SHP with receptors (5Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In summary, we identified SHP as a novel transcription coactivator of NFκB and have further presented the experimental results indicating that targeted expression of SHP appears to function as a distinct regulatory component of the transcriptional activities of NFκB in oxLDL-treated, resting macrophage cells."

In an effort to understand the role SREBP-1c plays in lipogenic gene transcription, we have examined the functional interaction between SREBP-1c, nuclear factor Y, 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) receptors, and co-activators using the S14 gene promoter as a model. T3, glucose, and insulin rapidly induce S14 gene transcription in rat liver and in primary hepatocytes. Linker scanning analyses of the S14 promoter showed that an SRE at −139/−131 base pairs (bp) binding SREBP-1c and a Y-box at −104/−99 bp binding NF-Y are indispensable for both T3- and SREBP-1c-mediated induction of S14 promoter activity in rat primary hepatocytes. T3 and glucose/insulin induce S14 gene transcription through separate enhancers. Enhancer substitution studies reveal a preferential interaction between SREBP-1c·NF-Y and the T3regulatory region (−2.8/−2.5 kb) binding thyroid hormone receptor/RXR heterodimers. Elevating hepatocellular levels of specific co-activators (CBP, p/CAF, or GCN5) induced S14 promoter activity 2–3-fold, while SREBP-1c induced promoter activity 10-fold. The combination of these treatments induced S14 promoter activity (20–35-fold). However, this additive effect was lost when the T3 regulatory region was deleted. Based on these results, we suggest that the SREBP-1c·NF-Y complex facilitates the interaction between co-activators that are recruited to distal hormone-regulated enhancers and the general transcription machinery that binds the S14 proximal promoter.

Emerging evidence suggests that SREBP-1c is involved in the control of lipogenesis, while SREBP-2 functions in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis (1Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

While SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c are derived from a common gene, differential promoter usage and splicing accounts for the variations in the N termini sequence (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Rnase protection studies suggest that SREBP-1c is the major SREBP-1 subtype expressed in human and rodent liver (3Shimomura I Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin.

SREBP precursors (∼125 kDa) are tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum and are converted to a mature (nuclear, ∼65 kDa) form by two proteolytic cleavage steps in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). The nuclear form of SREBP (nSREBP) is a helix-loop-helix transcription factor that binds sterol regulatory elements (SRE; PyGCPy) in sterol-responsive genes. The proteolytic steps are important regulatory events in the cholesterol regulation of nSREBP-1 and SREBP-2 levels (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Typically, these SREs are located within a few nucleotides of binding sites for other transcription factors (e.g. Sp1 and/or NF-Y). In most genes studied, SREBPs functionally interact with these nearby transcription factors to control gene transcription. The functional interaction between SREBP-1a and other transcription factors has been attributed to both cooperative binding of the two transcription factors to DNA (13Ericsson J. Jackson S.M.

Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar) and is viewed as a weak activator of transcription (1Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

However, the SREBP partners, Sp1 and NF-Y, both physically and functionally interact with co-activators like CBP, p300, p/CAF, and GCN5 (p/CAF-B) (19Naar A.M. Beaurang P.A. Robinson K.M. Oliner J.D.

In addition, many SREBP-1c-regulated lipogenic genes are induced by insulin, T3, or steroid hormone through distinct cis-regulatory elements (24Jump D.B. J. Biol.

T3 and steroid nuclear receptors also bind co-activators including CBP, p300, the GCN5 analog, p/CAF, the p160 family (SRC1/NcoA-1; p160/NcoA-2/Tif2/Grip1; pCIP/AIBI/ACTR/RAC/TRAM), and the TRAP·ARC·DRIP complex (29Ito M.

Because T3 and steroids are strong activators of gene transcription, this raises the question of the role a weak activator, like SREBP-1c, plays in hormonal regulation of gene transcription. We have used the rat liver S14 gene to address this question. S14 gene transcription is induced by T3, insulin, and glucose and repressed by fatty acids (24Jump D.B. J. Biol.

Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) bind as heterodimers to three TREs within a distal thyroid hormone regulatory region (TRR; −2.8 to −2.5 kb) (35Liu H.C. Towle H.C. Mol.

Dutcher A.K. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9437-9445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We previously reported that the inverted CCAAT-box binding NF-Y (−104/−99 bp) was indispensable for T3-mediated transactivation of the S14 gene (32Jump D.B. Badin M.V. Thelen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27778-27786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The SREBP-1c binding site is located 25 nucleotides upstream from the Y-box. In this report, we show that the SRE is also indispensable for hormone regulation of S14 gene transcription. However, the SRE is a composite element binding both SREBP-1c and GATA-related proteins. SREBP-1c augments, while GATA-6 attenuates, S14 promoter activity. SREBP-1c and NF-Y functionally interact with T3 nuclear receptors binding a distal enhancer, an interaction that is augmented by specific co-activators. Based on these results, we suggest that the SREBP-1c·NF-Y complex facilitates the interaction between co-activators that are recruited to distal hormone-regulated enhancers and the general transcription machinery that binds the S14 proximal promoter.

Increasing levels of Fl-SREBP-1c increased S14 promoter activity 3-fold with no evidence of squelching (i.e. inhibition of CAT activity with high levels of co-transfected SREBP-1c). While the nuclear form yields an 8-fold maximal induction, high levels of co-transfected SREBP-1c squelch CAT activity. The dominant negative SREBP-1c had no effect on S14 promoter activity, indicating a requirement for SREBP-1c binding DNA for its effect on S14 promoter activity. The nuclear form of SREBP-1c was used in all subsequent transfection studies. To determine the role SREBP-1c plays in the context of the full-length S14 promoter function, we used a linker scanning mutagenesis approach. Fig. 3 A illustrates the location of the 10-linker scanning mutations that traverse the SRE and Y-box as well as the location of the upstream T3 and insulin/glucose-regulated enhancers controlling S14 promoter activity. Primary hepatocytes were transfected with S14CAT fusion genes containing either the native or mutant versions of the S14 promoter plus an expression vector for T3 receptors (MLV-TRβ1). In cells receiving the native promoter, T3 induced CAT activity 40-fold (Fig. 3 B). Mutations at positions 1, 2, 6, 9, and 10 did not impede T3-activation of S14CAT promoter activity. However, little or no T3 induction of CAT activity was seen in hepatocytes transfected with reporter genes containing mutations overlapping both the SRE (positions 7 and 8) or Y-box (positions 3 and 4). These same mutations led to a 70–80% decline in basal (−T3) S14 promoter activity. SREBP-1c is induced by insulin and glucose and represents one of the factors that accounts for the insulin/glucose-mediate induction of S14 gene transcription (43Foretz M Guichard C. Farre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). To determine how mutations in the S14 promoter affect SREBP-1c induction of S14CAT activity, this experiment was repeated with overexpressed SREBP-1c (Fig. 3 C). Primary hepatocytes are transfected with MLV-TRβ1 and the various S14CAT fusion genes and treated with T3. As a control, hepatocytes were co-transfected with an SV-Sport expression vector containing no SREBP-1c. These cells were also treated with T3. Co-transfection of nSREBP-1c induced CAT activity nearly 6-fold in cells receiving the native S14CAT reporter gene. As with the T3 study, mutations at both the SRE and Y-box abrogated this induction. While the mutation at the SRE is expected to abrogate SREBP-1c-stimulated promoter activity, the mutation at the Y-box indicates a requirement for this element in SREBP-1c activation of S14 promoter activity. We infer from this result that insulin induction of S14 gene transcription (34Jump D.B. Bell A Lepar G Hu D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 655-1660Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) requires both the SRE and Y-box elements. Clearly, the SRE and Y-box are indispensable for hormone-induced S14 promoter activity. Several studies have reported that the functional interaction between SREBP1 and NF-Y in specific promoters can be attributed to cooperative binding of SREBP1 and NF-Y to promoters or the recruitment of specific co-activators to promoters (12Magana M.M.

By a combination of photoaffinity labeling of the transport protein in rabbit ileal brush border membrane vesicles, enzymatic fragmentation, and epitope-specific antibodies we could localize an interaction point of the 7 position of bile acids to the terminal 56–67 amino acids. Photoaffinity labeling was carried out with the photoreactive bile acid analogue 2-(7,7-azo-3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-[3β-3H]cholan- 24-oylamino)-ethane-sulfonic acid (specific radioactivity, 20.25 Ci/mmol) synthesized as described elsewhere (16Kramer W.

Acrylamide, N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide and Serva Blue R-250 were from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Marker proteins for the determination of molecular masses were from Sigma Aldrich, and Scintillator Quickszint 501 was from Zinsser Analytic GmbH (Frankfurt, Germany). Precasted gels for SDS-PAGE were from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). Chymotrypsin, trypsin, thermolysin, and papain were from Sigma, whereas endoproteinase Glu C was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antibodies against the rabbit ileal bile acid transporter IBAT were generated in guinea pigs using fusion proteins between the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein and the C-terminal 23 amino acids (KIBMAL-3) or C-terminal 51 amino acids (KIBMAL-1) of the rabbit ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporting protein (GenBankTM accession number 254357). Rabbit ileal brush border membrane vesicles (100–250 μg of protein) preloaded with 10 mm Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), 300 mm mannitol were incubated with radiolabeled photoreactive bile acid analogues in 10 mm Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm mannitol at 20 °C for 10 min in the dark. Photocross-linking was achieved by ultraviolet irradiation at 350 nm for 10 min using a Rayonet RPR-100 photochemical reactor (Southern Ultraviolet Company, Hamden, CT) equipped with four RPR 3500 Å lamps. Afterward, the vesicle suspensions were diluted with ice-cold 10 mm Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), 300 mm mannitol, and washing was repeated twice. SDS-PAGE was carried out in vertical slab gels (20 × 17 × 0.15 cm) using an electrophoresis system LE 2/4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with gel concentrations of 9–15% at a ratio of 97.2% acrylamide and 2.8%N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide or for analytical purposes, in precasted NOVEX gels (4–12%, 12%, or 15% (Invitrogen), using an electrophoresis system XCell II from Novex. Electrophoretic separation of peptide fragments was performed in Tris/Tricine gels (16.5%) according to Schägger and von Jagow (18Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10407) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the gels were fixed in 12.5% trichloroacetic acid followed by staining with Serva Blue R-250 and determination of radioactivity by slicing of the gel lanes in 2-mm pieces, digestion of proteins with tissue solubilizer Biolute S, and liquid scintillation counting using a Scintillator Quickszint 501. Alternatively, proteins or peptides were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. Photolabeled monomeric and dimeric IBAT proteins were enriched by preparative SDS gel electrophoresis. Usually, 25 samples of rabbit ileal brush border membrane vesicles (100 μg of protein) were photolabeled each with 0.70 μm (1 μCi) 2-(7,7-azo-3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-[3β-3H]cholan-24-oylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid in 10 mm Tris/Hepes buffer (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm mannitol. After three washings, the membrane proteins (2.5 mg of membrane protein) were solubilized in 1000 μl of sample buffer (62.5 mmTris/HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.001% bromophenol blue). After centrifugation, the sample was applied to the separation gel of a preparative 7.5% SDS gel (diameter, 28 mm; length of separation gel, 5 cm). Electrophoresis was performed at 500 V (40 mA, 6 W), and the eluate was fractionated into 1.5-ml fractions. 10-μl aliquots were removed for determination of the distribution of radioactivity, and 10 μl of each fraction were precipitated (19Wessel D. Flügge U.J. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3105) Google Scholar) for analysis of protein composition by SDS-PAGE on 9% precasted gels followed by Serva Blue R-250 staining or blotting and detection of IBAT proteins with anti-IBAT antibodies. The protein in 70 μl of those fractions immunoreactive for the monomeric 46 kDa or the dimeric 93 kDa IBAT protein was precipitated by chloroform/methanol, and after SDS-PAGE on 9% gels the distribution of radioactivity was determined by slicing of the gels into 2-mm pieces and subsequent liquid scintillation counting after digestion of proteins with Biolute S (Zinsser Analytic GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany). The fractions containing the radiolabeled monomeric 46-kDa IBAT protein were pooled and used for further analysis by enzymatic fragmentation. Brush border membrane vesicles or fractions from preparative SDS gel electrophoresis containing enriched IBAT protein were delipidated with chloroform/methanol (19Wessel D. Flügge U.J. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3105) Google Scholar) and redissolved in 3 μl of Tris/HCl buffer (pH 6.8), 0.2% SDS, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol/0.005% bromphenol blue. Enzymatic fragmentation was carried out by adding 5 μl of freshly prepared solutions of chymotrypsin (0.5–100 ng/ml), trypsin (1–100 ng/ml), papain (5–100 ng/ml), or endoproteinase Glu C (2–100 ng/ml) in the above buffer and subsequent incubation at 30 °C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer containing 4 mmEDTA, 4 mm iodoacetamide, 4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and heating for 5 min to 95 °C followed by subsequent peptide analysis by SDS-PAGE. Proteins and peptides were bound to nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm trans-blot transfer medium from Bio-Rad) by electrophoretic transfer from SDS gels in a transblot cell (Bio-Rad) using 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 33% methanol (pH 8.3) as transfer buffer. Blotting was performed at 300 mA for 3 h and 400 mA for another 0.5 h. Immunodetection of peptide fragments containing the C terminus of rabbit IBAT was performed with KIBMAL-3 or KIBMAL-1 antibodies at a dilution of 1:10000 and 1:10000 for the secondary anti-guinea pig antibody using the Western Light chemiluminescent detection kit from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Subsequently, the blots were sliced into 2-mm fragments and reswollen with 100 μl of water, and protein was digested by addition of 0.4 ml of Biolute S for 12 h. After the addition of 4 ml of Scintillator Quickszint 501 radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship pharmacophore model generated for mammalian Na+/bile acid cotransporters revealed the following specific interactions of a bile acid molecule with the transporter ligand-binding site (15Baringhaus K.-H. Matter H. Stengelin S. Kramer W. J.

From these findings we decided to use the photoreactive 7-diazirine analogue of cholyltaurine, 2-(7,7-azo-3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oyl)-amino-ethanesulfonic acid, to map the ligand-binding site caused by the specific interaction of the 7 position of bile acids with the transporter protein. The following strategy was used to localize bile acid-binding sites of the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter: (i) photoaffinity labeling of the intact functional Na+/bile acid transport system in rabbit ileal brush border membrane vesicles with 2-(7,7-azo-3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-[3β-3H]cholan-24 oylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid; (ii) enrichment of the radiolabeled monomeric 46-kDa and dimeric 93-kDa forms of IBAT protein by preparative SDS gel electrophoresis; (iii) enzymatic fragmentation of the enriched IBAT protein; (iv) separation of peptide fragments by electrophoresis; and (v) identification of radiolabeled peptides with epitope-specific antibodies raised against the C terminus. As epitope-specific antibodies we have chosen antibodies generated against the C-terminal 23 or 51 amino acids of rabbit IBAT. If the bile acid-binding site would be localized near to the N terminus, peptide fragments containing the C terminus of molecular masses close to intact IBAT would show a lack of radioactivity. In contrast, with a localization of the bile acid-binding site near to the C terminus rather small peptides containing both the radiolabeled attached bile acid and the C terminus are expected. The identification and determination of the molecular masses of those peptide fragments containing both the immunoreactive C terminus and the radiolabel of the covalently cross-linked bile acid therefore allows the localization of attachment site of the 7 position of the bile acid to the IBAT protein. For a precise localization of the bile acid-binding site on the IBAT amino acid sequence, a spectrum of clearly defined peptide fragments covering a broad range of molecular masses is necessary. We therefore investigated as peptidases endoproteinase Glu C (V8 protease), trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, subtilisin, and papain. Several clearly separated C-terminal peptides in the molecular mass range of 20.4–4 kDa could be generated by chymotrypsin, whereas with trypsin and endoproteinase Glu C less complex peptide patterns with fragments of 42, 32, and 6 kDa for trypsin and 7.5 kDa for endoproteinase Glu C were obtained. Papain digestion resulted in the generation of peptides of 39.6, 35, 32.8, and 13.3 kDa. With thermolysin and subtilisin no defined peptide fragments containing the C terminus were obtained. These fragmentation studies showed that the highest precision for localization of a bile acid-binding site would be possible by enzymatic fragmentation with chymotrypsin because chymotrypsin cleavage sites are distributed along the entire sequence of IBAT (Fig. 1). Immunodetection with KIBMAL-1 antibodies generated against the C-terminal 51 amino acids yielded similar labeling pattern as with KIBMAL-3 antibodies, indicating that the antibodies KIBMAL-1 (terminal 51 amino acids) and KIBMAL-3 (terminal 23 amino acids) primarily recognize epitopes localized in the C-terminal 23 amino acids (Fig.2). Peptide fragments with cleavage sites within the terminal 23 amino acids as possible with chymotrypsin probably will escape detection by KIBMAL-3 antibodies. It is therefore appropriate to assume that the probable amino acid sequence of a peptide fragment can be deduced from its molecular mass by comparison with the calculated mass of peptide fragments starting from the C terminus to the particular enzymatic cleavage site. As a next step rabbit ileal brush border membrane vesicles photoaffinity-labeled with 2-(7,7-azo-3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-[3β-3H]cholan-24-oylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid were digested with 40 or 80 ng/ml chymotrypsin followed by separation of the peptide fragments by SDS-PAGE using the Schägger & von Jagow system (18Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10407) Google Scholar) to allow an optimal separation and resolution of small molecular mass peptide fragments. Fig.3 A (upper panel) shows the labeling pattern of ileal brush border membrane vesicles with incorporation of the photoprobe predominantly into three polypeptides of 14 kDa, the ileal lipid-binding protein, and the monomeric and dimeric forms of IBAT of 46 and 93 kDa, respectively. Treatment with 80 ng/ml chymotrypsin generated several radiolabeled peptide fragments of 17.2, 11, 7.7, 7.2, and 6.2 kDa with highest incorporation of the radiolabeled bile acid analogue into the polypeptides of 7.7 and 7.2 kDa (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether the radiolabeled chymotryptic peptides are derived from the photolabeled ileal Na+/bile acid cotransport system composed of several subunits of IBAT and ILBP, comparable labeling experiments were performed with brush border membrane vesicles obtained from rabbit jejunum. Fig. 3 B (upper panel) shows labeling of only one polypeptide of 87 kDa assumed to be a component of a passive uptake system for bile acids in the upper small intestine (20Kramer W. Girbig F. Gutjahr U. Kowalewski S. Jouvenal K. Müller G. Tripier D. Wess G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18035-18046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After digestion with 80 ng/ml chymotrypsin, a completely different peptide was obtained with no prominently labeled peptide fragments in contrast to ileal brush border membrane vesicles (Fig. 3 B). These findings clearly demonstrate that the radiolabeled peptide fragments obtained by chymotrypsin treatment of photolabeled rabbit ileal brush border membrane vesicles arose from the protein components of the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransport system, IBAT and ILBP. To determine the attachment site of bile acids to the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter, rabbit ileal brush border membrane vesicles were photoaffinity labeled with 2-(7,7-azo-3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-[3β-3H]cholan-24-oylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid, and subsequently the membrane proteins were fractionated by preparative SDS gel electrophoresis. Aliquots of each fraction were submitted to SDS-PAGE, and the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporting protein was detected by Western blotting using IBAT-specific antibodies as well as by determination of the incorporation of the radiolabeled photocross-linked bile acid by slicing of the gels and subsequent liquid scintillation counting. Fig.4 A shows the Coomassie Blue stains of the fractions eluted in the 46-kDa range from the preparative SDS gel, and in Fig. 4 B the corresponding immunostains using the IBAT antibody KIBMAL-3 are shown. The intensity of the IBAT-positive signals of 46 and 93 kDa correlated with the incorporation of the radioactively labeled bile acid photoaffinity probe (Fig. 4 C). Fig. 4 B shows that the 46-kDa IBAT enriched by preparative SDS gel electrophoresis aggregates to a dimer (fractions 6, 8, and 10); in the corresponding Coomassie gels (Fig. 4 A), however, no stained band at 93 kDa is detectable, indicating the minute amounts of IBAT protein present in ileal brush border membrane vesicles, which excludes a direct analysis of the attachment site by sequencing or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The fractions containing the radiolabeled 46- or 93-kDa forms of IBAT were pooled, respectively, and used for further analysis. Because the mode and location of contact points for dimerization of the IBAT protein are not known, we used only the monomeric 46-kDa IBAT fractions for further analysis of the bile acid attachment site. The fractions containing the 46-kDa radiolabeled IBAT protein were submitted to enzymatic fragmentation by chymotrypsin using high resolution gels with separation distances greater than 12 cm. To allow a precise alignment of radiolabeled bands to C-terminal positive peptide fragments, the peptides were blotted after electrophoresis to nitrocellulose sheets; the nitrocellulose lanes were split into two halves, one being used for immunoblotting with KIBMAL antibodies, and subsequently, after indication of the Western positive bands, both stripes were cut into 2-mm pieces and counted for radioactivity. Fig. 5 shows the congruent results from two independently performed experiments starting from different vesicle preparations. 25 portions of ileal brush border membrane vesicles with 100 μg of protein each were photolabeled with 0.7 μm (1 μCi) of 2-(7,7-azo-3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-[3β-3H]cholan-24-oylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid, and after preparative SDS-PAGE the protein fractions containing the immunoreactive 46-kDa IBAT protein were digested with 75 ng/ml chymotrypsin. After SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting the nitrocellulose sheets were cut into 2-mm pieces, and the distribution of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The experiment shown in Fig.5 A reveals that nine radiolabeled polypeptides of 20.4, 18.9, 17.1, 12.0, 10.3, 7.6, 6.6, 5.3, and 4.0 kDa were clearly separated, and 16 peptides containing the C terminus of 20.6, 19.3, 18.1, 17.4, 15.0, 12.3, 11.1, 10.5, 9.8, 9.2, 8.8, 8.3, 7.9, 7.4, and 6.9 kDa are visible after immunostaining with KIBMAL-1 antibodies. Fig. 5 B shows the results obtained from an independently executed experiment (a total of five independent experiments were performed leading to nearly identical results). After electrophoretic separation seven radioactively labeled polypeptides of 19.6, 17, 12.4, 10.3, 7.0, 5.5, and 4 kDa were clearly detectable (Fig. 5 B). Immunostaining identified peptides of 20.4, 19.5, 17.9, 17.0, 14.9, 12.1, 11.0, 10.3, 9.7, 9.1, 8.4, 7.8, 7.4, and 7.0 kDa reacting with C-terminal antibodies. From these experiments it can be deduced that the smallest peptide fragment of rabbit IBAT containing both the C terminus and the covalently photocross-linked bile acid at position 7 has a molecular mass of 6.6–7 kDa. Because KIBMAL-1 and KIBMAL-3 antibodies gave comparable immunostaining patterns, the chymotryptic peptide fragments detected with KIBMAL antibodies probably end at position 347 (the intact C terminus), 344, or 338. TableI lists the theoretical molecular masses of the possible chymotryptic peptides ending at position 347, 344, or 338. The radiolabeled peptides of 6.6–7 kDa reacting with C-terminal antibodies accordingly start downstream of position 280 (TableII). Accordingly, the attachment site of the 7-azi-derivative of cholyltaurine to the IBAT transporter is localized to the C-terminal 67–56 amino acids, i.e. the C-terminal 19–16% of the amino acid sequence of the ileal bile acid transporter protein.Table IAlignment of chymotryptic peptides containing the C terminus of the rabbit ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter to molecular masses of amino acid sequencesN terminus of the peptide (X)Molecular mass of peptide fragmentsIntact C terminusShortened C terminusX → 347X → 344X → 3381642080120428196381831886818496177061881818617813170232181516814796140052221467714305135152291377913407126172351311612744119542401257912206114172441215611784109942451199111619108942541098010607981825510799104269637280799876266836287717568026012289691065385748291664462725482295613957674977298577454024612302529649234133 Open table in a new tab Table IIAlignment of radioactively labeled chymotryptic peptides containing the C terminus of rabbit IBAT photolabeled with 2-(7,7-azo-3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-[3β-3H]cholan-24-olyamino-)ethanesulfonic acid to C-terminal amino acid sequencesPeptide foundC-terminal peptidesX→ 347 (intact)X → 344X → 33820.416416415419.216418.918318317.118818817.018812.424024022912.024524423510.325525510.02549.0(255)7.62802807.02892872806.82892872806.6291289280 Open table in a new tab The ileal Na+/bile acid cotransport system is a major regulator for serum cholesterol homeostasis and has become an area of increasing pharmacological interest. In earlier studies we could demonstrate by chemical modification of amino acid residues that vicinal cysteine groups and lysine residues are essential for the function of the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporting protein (21Kramer W. Nicol S.-B. Girbig F. Gutjahr U. Kowalewski S. Fasold H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We succeeded in the development of a predictive pharmacophore model for mammalian Na+/bile acid cotransporters, allowing the definition of a novel model for the interaction of bile acids with the transporter protein (14Kramer W. Stengelin S. Baringhaus K.-H. Enhsen A. Heuer H. Becker W. Corsiero D. Girbig F. Noll R. Weyland C. J.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2158-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the amino acids in a transporter protein is an appropriate way to identify those amino acids residues of importance for the function of the transporter. The identification of functionally essential amino acid residues does not, however, imply that they are part of the ligand-binding site. For an unequivocal localization of the ligand binding a covalent cross-linking of the ligand to the peptide backbone and subsequent determination of the cross-linking position is necessary. The ileal Na+/bile acid cotransport system in intact ileal tissue is a heteromeric protein complex of 451 kDa composed of several transporter units and associated ileal lipid-binding proteins (3Kramer W. Girbig F. Gutjahr U. Kowalewski S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Kramer W. Corsiero D. Friedrich M. Girbig F. Stengelin S. Weyland C. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 241-335Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because the structure and composition of the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransport system in recombinant cell lines is not known and because functional differences of transporters found in intact tissues and recombinant cell lines were reported (22Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 53: 199-206Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we decided to photolabel the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter in situ using freshly isolated rabbit ileal brush border membrane vesicles with subsequent determination of the attachment site. Originally we attempted to purify the photolabeled transporter to homogeneity and to apply a novel technology we have developed and successfully used for ILBP (23Kramer W. Sauber K. Baringhaus K.-H. Kurz M. Stengelin S. Lange G. Corsiero D. Girbig F. König W. Weyland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7291-7301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with enzymatic fragmentation and sequence analysis of the labeled peptides by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. This approach was, however, not applicable to the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporting protein caused by inherent experimental limitations and characteristics of IBAT: (i) The amount of the transporter protein in the ileocyte brush border membrane is extremely low. With increasing purity the transporter protein aggregates to macromolecular protein complexes, and the yield of protein after each purification step was very low (from 80 mg of brush border membrane protein we could isolate a minute amount of pure IBAT protein resulting in one very faint band after SDS-PAGE; estimated amount, <1–10 ng of protein). (ii) For detectable satellites representing the cross-linked product of the bile acid and the representative bile acid binding protein in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, a concentration of ≥0.5 mm for the photoreactive bile acid and ≥0.1 mg/ml for the bile acid binding protein is necessary (23Kramer W. Sauber K. Baringhaus K.-H. Kurz M. Stengelin S. Lange G. Corsiero D. Girbig F. König W. Weyland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7291-7301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); such a concentration of functionally intact IBAT protein cannot be achieved by using brush border membrane vesicles, transfected cells, or intact ileal tissue. (iii) A principle alternative would be the use of high expression systems such as Pichia pastoris or Baculovirus, which may generate the necessary amounts of transporter protein. After purification these transporters may be incorporated into proteoliposomes, which could deal as the starting material for the identification of the ligand-binding site. A prerequisite for such an approach is the functional reconstitution of the transporter protein into proteoliposomes. Unfortunately, however, all attempts to functionally reconstitute the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter failed, even with protocols successfully used for a reconstitution of the hepatic canalicular bile acid transporter (24Ruetz S. Hugentobler G. Meier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6147-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or the H+/oligopeptide transporter from intestine (25Kramer W. Girbig F. Gutjahr U. Kowalewski S. Adam F. Schiebler W. Eur. Biochem. 1992; 204: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore followed the strategy to photolabel the transporter protein in its natural functional state and subsequently determine the attachment site by the identification of those peptide fragments containing both the covalently cross-linked photoreactive bile acid analogue and the C terminus using specific antibodies generated against the 23 or 51 C-terminal antibodies. From the various enzymes investigated, chymotrypsin yielded the best molecular mass spectrum of peptide fragments of the ileal bile acid transporter containing the C terminus from about 21 to 4 kDa. From repeated experiments using different separation systems it became evident that the smallest peptide fragments containing both the C terminus and the covalently attached radioactive bile acid have a molecular mass of 6.6–7 kDa. This means that the attachment site of the 7-position of a bile acid is localized on a peptide fragment of the C-terminal 67–56 amino acids downstream of position 280 (7678.9 Da) or possibly even downstream of positions 289 (6911 Da) or 291 (6644 Da). The identification of an attachment site of the 7 position of 7-azi-cholyltaurine to the C terminus does not mean that the ligand-binding site of IBAT is exclusively build up by the C-terminal 56–67 amino acids. It is probable that the ligand-binding site is formed by several transmembrane domains from different regions of the IBAT sequence. What we could show here is that the 7 position of cholyltaurine during binding to IBAT preferably interacts with a domain comprising the C-terminal 56–67 amino acids. The labeling of other peptides not containing the C terminus may indicate the binding of bile acids to other sequences that either are part of the primary ligand-binding site or are representative of secondary binding sites similar to the behavior of ILBP (23Kramer W. Sauber K. Baringhaus K.-H. Kurz M. Stengelin S. Lange G. Corsiero D. Girbig F. König W. Weyland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7291-7301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). According to the seven-transmembrane domain model, the identified bile acid-binding site would be localized in a peptide fragment containing the seventh transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmically located C terminus (Fig.6 A). Based on the newer topology assuming nine transmembrane domains, the bile acid-binding site of the Na+/bile acid cotransporter would be harbored in a peptide sequence consisting of the ninth transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic C terminus (Fig. 6 B). Independently on the topology model, the binding site would not involve a large extracellular peptide loop but only, if at all, a very small extracellular peptide sequence of less than 8 (seven-transmembrane model) or 10 (nine-transmembrane model) amino acids. Such an attachment of the 7 position of cholyltaurine to an amino acid sequence downstream of position 280 or even 291 is in line with our previous investigations by topological photoaffinity labeling of the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransport system (5Kramer W. Wess G. Bewersdorf U. Corsiero D. Girbig F. Weyland C. Stengelin S. Enhsen A. Bock K. Kleine H. Le Dreau M.-A. Schäfer H.-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 456-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). With membrane-impermeable dimeric bile acid analogues that specifically inhibit the ileal bile acid transporter from the luminal side without being translocated across the brush border membrane, the cytoplasmically attached ILBP could be labeled, suggesting that the bile acid-binding site is located closely to the cytoplasmic side of the transporter protein rather than to an extracellular loop (5Kramer W. Wess G. Bewersdorf U. Corsiero D. Girbig F. Weyland C. Stengelin S. Enhsen A. Bock K. Kleine H. Le Dreau M.-A. Schäfer H.-L. Eur. J.

The localization of the bile acid-binding site to the C-terminal part of the transporter protein is in accordance with further indirect evidence. We demonstrated earlier that the inactivation of the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter by thiol-modifying agents can be prevented by performing the chemical modification in the presence of bile acids (21Kramer W. Nicol S.-B. Girbig F. Gutjahr U. Kowalewski S. Fasold H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Recently it was demonstrated that the inactivation of the human ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter by membrane-impermeable methanethiosulfonates disappeared after site-directed mutagenesis of Cys270 to Ala270, indicating that this conserved cysteine residue is responsible for inhibition of bile acid transport activity by thiol agents (27Hallén S. Fryklund J. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6743-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because inactivation of the wild-type human ileal bile acid transporter was prevented by increasing concentrations of cholyltaurine, it was suggested that cysteine 270 is located within or near the bile acid-binding site (27Hallén S. Fryklund J. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6743-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In agreement with a location of the bile acid-binding site to the C-terminal part are also findings from mutations of the human bile acid transporter. Mutations at position 290 (P290S), 262 (T262M), or 243 (L243P) led to a complete loss of transporter function without changes in the expression of the mutant transporters, indicating that these mutations interfere with the bile acid binding or transport process (9Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.-M. Hardiker W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Oelkers P. Kirby L.C. Heubi J.E. Dawson P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Future studies with the expression of trunctated forms of the ileal Na+/bile acid transporter and attempts for two- or three-dimensional crystals of these modified transporters should allow further refinement of the bile acid-binding site.

These proteins are divided into three groups based on their sequence identity: the C group, which includes cholinesterases and fungal lipases, the L group, which includes lipoprotein lipases and bacterial lipases, and the H group, named after the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)1 discovered by Holmet al. (7Holm C. Kirchgessner T.G. Svenson K.L. Fredrikson G. Nilsson S. Miller C.G. Shively J.E. Heinzmann C. Sparkes R.S. Mohandas T. Lusis A.J. Belfrage P. Schotz M.C. Science. 1988; 241: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), which comprises proteins showing sequence similarity with HSL. Some years ago, Hemilä et al. (2Hemilä H. Koivula T.T. Palva I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1210: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) reported a new gene from the thermophilic strain Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius, encoding a protein of unknown function with sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of mammalian HSL. The identification of other related sequences allowed the definition of the H group. We focused on this thermostable member of the family, which we first identified in a crude extract of A. acidocaldarius and named esterase 2 (EST2) (5Manco G. Adinolfi E. Pisani F.M. Carratore V. Rossi M. Prot. Pept. Lett. 1997; 4: 375-382Google Scholar). To study its structure-function relationships in detail, we overexpressed the functional protein in Escherichia coli and purified and characterized the recombinant enzyme, which was demonstrated to be a monomeric B-type carboxylesterase of about 34 kDa. The enzyme displays an optimal temperature at 70 °C and remarkable temperature stability with a half-life of 3 h at 75 °C. Maximal activity was observed with para-nitrophenyl (pNP) esters with acyl chains of six to eight carbon atoms (8Manco G. Adinolfi E. Pisani F.M. Ottolina G. Carrea G. Rossi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Residues belonging to the catalytic triad were identified as Ser-155, Asp-252, and His-282 (9Manco G. Febbraio F. Adinolfi E. Rossi M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1789-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The information concerning the thermostability within the esterase/lipase family was also interesting (10Manco G. Febbraio F. Rossi M. Prog. Bio/Technol. 1998; 15: 325-330Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To further address this point, we cloned, overexpressed, characterized, and constructed a model for the related esterase from the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus (6Manco G. Giosue' E. D'Auria S. Herman P. Carrea G. Rossi M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,11Manco G. Camardella L. Febbraio F. Adamo G. Carratore V. Rossi M. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, Wei et al. (12Wei Y. Contreras J.A. Sheffield P. Osterlund T. Derewenda U. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Holm C. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) solved the structure of brefeldin A esterase from the strain Bacillus subtilis, which turned out to belong to the H group. This was the first member of the group to be structurally characterized. More recently, we reported (13De Simone G. Galdiero S. Manco G. Lang D. Rossi M. Pedone C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) the crystal structure of EST2 complexed with a substrate analogue solved by multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction on a seleno-methionine derivative, at 2.6-Å resolution. The two structures revealed a common topological α/β-hydrolase fold, which is well known among lipases (14Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar, 15Derewenda Z.S. Adv.

This fold is characterized by a central, mixed β-sheet, flanked by helical connections. Moreover, the catalytic center contains a triad of amino acids (SH(D/E)) reminiscent of serine proteinases, which is responsible for the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the scissile ester bond. However, the two structures differ from the canonical α/β-hydrolase fold because of the lack of the helix αD and the presence of a cap that covers and protects the active site (12Wei Y. Contreras J.A. Sheffield P. Osterlund T. Derewenda U. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Holm C. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13De Simone G. Galdiero S. Manco G. Lang D. Rossi M. Pedone C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); therefore, the H group may well represent a new family in contrast with a classification previously proposed (17Heikinheimo P. Goldman A. Jeffries C. Ollis D.L. Structure Fold. Des. 1999; 7: R141-R146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Actually, in the ESTHER classification (18Cousin X. Hotelier T. Giles K. Toutant J.P. Chatonnet A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the two structures define the HSL family, which, to date, comprises more than 64 members. Structural investigations on EST2 were undertaken to study its structure-function relationships in detail (13De Simone G. Galdiero S. Manco G. Lang D. Rossi M. Pedone C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19D'Auria S. Herman P. Lakowicz J.R. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Rossi M. Manco G.

Proteins. 2000; 40: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, esterases are enzymes of considerable industrial potential. According to a classical definition, esterases are lipolytic enzymes that, unlike lipases, hydrolyze soluble fatty acid esters without any interfacial activation (21Desnuelle, P. (1972) in The Enzymes (Boyer, P. D., ed) pp. 575–616, pp. 194–288, Academic Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 22Brockerhoff H. Jensen R.G. Lipolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1974: 194-288Crossref Google Scholar). The resistance to denaturation of thermophilic enzymes coupled with their ability to hydrolyze substrates that are insoluble at normal temperatures, makes thermostable lipases/esterases an attractive alternative to mesophilic enzymes (23Niehaus F. Bertoldo C. Kahler M. Antranikian G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 51: 711-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Although a few lipases have been so far reported from thermophilic sources (24Kim M.H. Kim H.K. Lee J.K. Park S.Y. Oh T.K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 25Cho A.R. Yoo S.K. Kim E.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 235-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schmidt-Dannert C. Rua M.L. Schmid R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 284: 194-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), detailed characterizations have still not been performed. The aim of this work was to obtain, through a combination of site-directed and saturation mutagenesis, variants of the thermophilic esterase with altered specificity, and in particular, better specificity against esters whose acyl chains were larger than eight carbon atoms. For the rational design of specific mutations, we took advantage of the availability of the EST2 structure complexed with a HEPES molecule, covalently bound to the active site Ser155. Although some variants were obtained with changes in the desired direction, the most striking result was the enhanced steady-state activity, depending on mutation and on substrate, of all the variants at 70 °C. p-Nitrophenyl (pNP) esters, Fast Blue RR, β-naphthyl acetate, and β-naphthyl laurate were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). E. coli Top 10 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used as host for cloning whereas E. coliBL21(DE3) harbored the recombinant plasmids for gene expression. The expression vector utilized (pT7-SCII-AG) was prepared starting from vector pT7-SCII-MG1 (8Manco G. Adinolfi E. Pisani F.M. Ottolina G. Carrea G. Rossi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The est2 gene was amplified by using the pT7-SCII-MG1 vector, as template, recombinant Taq DNA polymerase, and oligonucleotides est5′ (5′-GGCGACCCATATGCCGCTCGATCCC-3′) and est3′ (5′-GCGCGAAGGGAAGATCCGCGCGTGTTCG-3′) as forward and reverse primers, respectively, in a 30-cycle polymerase chain reaction (1 min at 92 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). The amplification primer est5′ was designed to introduce a NdeI restriction site (underlined) upstream from the initiation site, whereas est3′ was located downstream from the stop codon of EST2 and from a SmaI restriction site located outside the coding region. The PCR product, eluted from an agarose gel and digested withNdeI and SmaI, was ligated into theNdeI-SmaI-linearized expression vector pT7-SCII to create the pT7-SCII-AG construct. The cloned fragment was completely sequenced on both strands using the T7 DNA polymerase sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) to verify that only desired mutations were introduced during amplification. In this way, the est2 gene was expressed under the direct control of the IPTG inducible promoter of the φ10 gene (27Brown W.C. Campbell J.L. Gene. 1993; 127: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Standard molecular cloning techniques were utilized (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The site-directed mutants presented in this study were prepared by the overlap extension method (29Ho S.N. Hunt D.H. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) with the polymerase chain reaction. The plasmid pT7-SCII-AG (this paper), a derivative of PT7-SCII-MG1 (8Manco G. Adinolfi E. Pisani F.M. Ottolina G. Carrea G. Rossi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was used as the template for amplification reactions carried out with the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), using two end primers and two complementary mutagenic primers for each site-specific mutation. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were as follows (mismatch sites for site-directed mutagenesis are in boldface): M211T (+), 5′-CCTGACCGGCGGCATGACGCTCTGGTTCCGGG-3′; M211T(−), 5′-CCCGGAACCAGAGCGTCATGCCGCCGGTCAGG-3′; R215L(+), 5′-GCTCTGGTTCCTGGATCAATACTTGAA-3′; R215L(−), 5′-TGTTCAAGTATTGATCCAGGAACCAGA-3′; the oligonucleotides used for the saturation mutagenesis were as follows: M211(+), 5′-CCTGACCGGCGGCATG(atgc)(atgc)(gc)CTCTGGTT-3′; M211(−), 5′-GGAACCAGAG(gc)(atgc)(atgc)CATGCCGCCGGTCA-3′. The two external oligonucleotides were: Ser(+), 5′-TCGGCGGAGACGGCGCCGGAGGGAA-3′; Cter(−), 5′-TTGGATCCGCCTTTTGGTCAGG-3′. Each amplification reaction was performed with 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The final amplified products were cut appropriately with restriction enzymes, purified with an agarose gel-extraction kit (Quiaex II, M-Medical), ligated into pT77-SCII-AG or pT77-SCII-AGM215L, and linearized with the same restriction enzymes. The cloned DNA fragments were entirely sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutation(s) and to rule out the possibility that replication errors were introduced during amplification. The ligation mixtures were used to transform E. coli Top 10. In the case of site-directed mutants, selected colonies were grown for plasmidic DNA preparation and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. After IPTG-induced overexpression into E. coliBL21(DE3) cells, partially purified enzymes were assayed with esters of different acyl chain length (from 4 to 16). As regarding the saturation mutagenesis approach, a rapid screening on nitrocellulose filters was devised to select variants with interesting phenotypes. Briefly, the colonies obtained from plasmid transformation in E. coli Top 10 were replicated on two nitrocellulose filters and tested for esterase activity on β-naphthyl acetate or β-naphthyl laurate. The filters were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing to obtain cell disruption. Released proteins were fixed by 10-min incubation at 70 °C, and then filters were incubated in a solution (100 ml) of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mg of β-naphthyl acetate or β-naphthyl laurate (dissolved in 0.5 ml of methanol) and 25 mg of Fast Blue RR at room temperature. After 10–15 min of incubation, the reactions were stopped by rinsing with tap water. The activity toward β-naphthyl acetate was adopted initially as control of enzyme expression, whereas activity toward β-naphthyl laurate was employed to identify mutants with altered specificity. Successively, screening with β-naphthyl acetate was used to select mutants with altered specificity toward esters with shorter acyl chains. The changed selectivity was further controlled by spectrophotometric standard assay at 70 °C. DNA sequencing of extracted DNA allowed to identify the mutations. As a result, the mutants M211V, M211S, and M211S/R215L were obtained. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the constructs and cultured at a large scale in 2 liters of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 100 μg of ampicillin. Cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h at a cell density corresponding to an optical density of 1A600 nm. Thereafter, cells were harvested by centrifugation (13,200 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), washed with 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5)/2.5 mm MgCl2/0.5 mm EDTA and stored at −20 °C. Purification of the recombinant enzymes was performed as previously described for the wild type (8Manco G. Adinolfi E. Pisani F.M. Ottolina G. Carrea G. Rossi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The time course of the esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNP esters was followed by monitoring ofp-nitrophenoxide production at 405 nm, in 1-cm path-length cells with a DU 600 spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Initial rates were calculated by linear least-squares analysis of time courses comprising less than 10% of the total turnover. Assays were performed at 70 °C in mixtures of 40 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4/0.09% (w/v) gum arabic/7.5% propan-2-ol (pH 7.1) containing pNP esters at different concentrations. Stock solutions of pNP esters were prepared by dissolving substrates in pure propan-2-ol. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 43,300 m−1cm−1 at 278 nm. Initial velocity versussubstrate concentration data were fitted to the Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the Michaelis-Menten equation, by weighted linear least-squares analysis with a personal computer and the GRAFIT program (30Leatherbarrow R.J. Grafit Version 3.0. Erithacus Softwere Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). Assays were done in duplicate or triplicate, and results for kinetic data were mean of two independent experiments. The inhibition by HEPES (sodium salt) and by propan-2-ol was evaluated by assaying EST2 activity in the standard assay in the presence of three different inhibitor's concentrations (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8m for HEPES; 0.39, 0.65, and 0.89 m for propan-2-ol) and different concentrations of pNP-hexanoate (range 12.5–300 μm). Electrophoretic runs were performed with a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II cell unit, at room temperature. 12.5% SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as described by Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Molecular mass markers (Prestained SDS-PAGE Standard Broad Range, Bio-Rad) were: myosin (205 kDa), β-galactosidase (120 kDa), bovine serum albumin (84 kDa), ovalbumin (52 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (36 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (30 kDa), lysozyme (22 kDa), and aprotinin (7.4 kDa). Far-UV (190–250 nm) CD measurements were performed in a spectropolarimeter model J-710 (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) at 50 °C under nitrogen flow. A cuvette (Helma, Jamaica, NY) of 0.1 cm path-length was used. Photomultiplier absorption did not exceed 600 V in the spectral region measured. A spectral acquisition spacing of 0.2 nm (1.0-nm bandwidth) was used. Each spectrum was averaged five times and smoothed with Spectropolarimeter System Software version 1.00 (Jasco). Protein concentration of the samples was 0.10 mg/ml in 40 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.1. To compare the thermal stability of wild type and mutant enzymes, spectral acquisition were achieved in the temperature range of 50–95 °C at 5 °C spacing. Moreover, the ellipticity readings at λ = 222 or λ = 290 nm were continuously monitored as the temperature was raised at 1 °C per min. The comparison was based on the midpoint measurements through the first derivative transformation of the denaturation curves, which appeared sigmoidal. Near-UV (250–320 nm) CD measurements were performed at 40 °C with a 1-cm path-length cuvette (Starna Brand, Essex, UK). Protein concentration of the samples was 0.3 mg/ml in 40 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.1. The visualization of EST2 structure (PDB file: 1EVQ; Protein Data Bank, Rutgers University, Upton, NY), the molecular surface analysis, and the energy minimization to evaluate residues substitution were carried out with the Swiss PDB viewer program (Glaxo Wellcome Experimental Research). The recently solved three-dimensional structure of the A. acidocaldarius EST2 revealed the fortuitous formation of a covalent adduct of the active site Ser-155 with a HEPES molecule (13De Simone G. Galdiero S. Manco G. Lang D. Rossi M. Pedone C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although sulfonic esters, such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, are known to be irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme (8Manco G. Adinolfi E. Pisani F.M. Ottolina G. Carrea G. Rossi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the above finding was unexpected, because HEPES is a sulfonic acid and therefore the mechanistic explanation for the adduct formation remained elusive. To address this point, investigations were carried out to verify whether or not HEPES (sodium salt) may really be an EST2 inhibitor and thus whether the enzyme-HEPES complex is actually an example of a mimic of the second tetrahedral intermediate, corresponding to the de-acylation step of the catalytic reaction. At saturating concentrations of substratepNP-hexanoate, high concentrations of HEPES (up to 1m) did not affect the EST2 activity. Moreover, prolonged incubations of EST2 with HEPES (up to 12 h) had no effect on its catalytic activity (data not shown). Fig.1 reports the Lineweaver-Burk plots of EST2 activity at three different HEPES concentrations. In the insert, a re-plot of the slope of each line against the respective inhibitor concentration is shown. From this analysis it turned out that HEPES is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme with a calculate KI of 0.78 m. Because the enzyme is able to catalyze the reverse reaction of esterification in organic solvents (8Manco G. Adinolfi E. Pisani F.M. Ottolina G. Carrea G. Rossi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we could infer that the finding in the crystals of a covalent adduct with HEPES was likely to be due to the particular conditions of “low water activity” that the protein requires to crystallize. In these conditions, the reverse reaction was favored, and therefore, a stable HEPES-enzyme complex could be formed. In this way, the HEPES molecule should be regarded as a substrate analogue, which was trapped as an acyl-enzyme intermediate on the synthetic catalytic route. Thus, what we are looking at is the first half of the reverse synthetic reaction, more than the second half of the hydrolytic reaction, even though it is predictable that the molecular recognition mechanisms of the acyl moiety are the same in both cases. Fig. 2 schematically shows the protein-ligand interactions with the sulfur atom covalently bound to Ser-155 and its piperazine ethane moiety fitting into a long hydrophobic tunnel closed at the end mostly by the side chains of Met-211 and Arg-215. Detailed analysis of the solvent-accessible surface of the EST2 structure revealed the presence of two buried cavities, marked a and b, of 45 and 60 Å3 respectively, nearby the active site (Fig. 2B). These two cavities are constellated with polar and charged residues to which water molecules are also hydrogen-bonded (Fig. 2C). In particular, cavity B of 60 Å3, located nearby the acyl binding pocket, is the largest of the 16 cavities found in the EST2 structure, and it is surrounded by the following residues: Trp-85, Asn-159, Ser-185, Gly-187, Tyr-188, Met-211, Phe-214, Arg-215, Phe-230, Ser-231, Leu-254, and Val-257. Two water molecules, 20 and 57, are located inside the buried cavity and form a network of hydrogen bonds with the surrounding residues. In particular, Arg-215 forms hydrogen bonds through the NH2 of its guanidinium group to water molecules 20, 38, and 57; moreover, another hydrogen bond is formed through NE of its side chain with water 38 that, along with 51, forms a second pair of water molecules involved in a network of hydrogen bonds with surrounding residues. Among these residues, Tyr-188 appears again. In contrast, Met-211 is not involved in hydrogen bonds, but its side chain participates in closing the hydrophobic tunnel at the bottom. We reasoned that a reduction in the steric hindrance afforded by the side chains of Met-211 and Arg-215 and eventually their substitution with residues that increase local hydrophobicity, could allow for a better binding of an ester with longer acyl chain. A visual inspection of a structural alignment in the H group among EST2, the brefeldin A esterase, the A. fulgidus esterase, the Moraxella TA144 lipase, the E. coli esterase, and the human hormone-sensitive lipase (13De Simone G. Galdiero S. Manco G. Lang D. Rossi M. Pedone C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) indicated that the two lipases of the H group held the charged residue glutamate and the small residue glycine, respectively, in place of Met-211. Both the hydrophobic residue leucine and the shortest residue methionine were observed in place of Arg-215 in the Moraxella TA144 lipase and human hormone-sensitive lipase, respectively. We decided to mutagenize residues Arg-215 and Met-211 to leucine and threonine, respectively, because lipases are more specific for esters with longer acyl chains. The mutagenesis strategy adopted was to introduce first leucine at position 215 and threonine at position 211, by site-directed mutagenesis, and then to change the second site by saturation mutagenesis, if either of the two former substitutions was found to give the desired effect. To this end, we prepared the expression vector pT7SCII-AG, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” which contains the est2 gene under the direct control of the IPTG-inducible promoter of the φ10 gene (29Ho S.N. Hunt D.H. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The availability of this clone yielded an easier way to handle the gene and to express the protein, which in the previously described expression system (8Manco G. Adinolfi E. Pisani F.M. Ottolina G. Carrea G. Rossi M. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was produced under the control of its own promoter. The Arg-215 and Met-211 residues were therefore changed to leucine and threonine, respectively, by means of the overlap extension method in PCR reactions (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). After confirming the mutations by DNA sequencing, the variant plasmids, together with the wild type as control, were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, which were cultured in a small scale (100 ml) in LB-rich medium and induced with 0.1 mm IPTG for 3 h at a cell density corresponding to an optical density of 1A600 nm. The harvested cells were disrupted with a French pressure cell, and after ultracentrifu"

Acetylation of specific lysine residues in histone N-terminal tails decreases their net positive charge, which has been proposed to cause an electrostatic repulsion between the histones and the negatively charged phosphate backbone of DNA (8Hong L. Schroth G.P. Matthews H.R. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 305-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that results in a more open chromatin conformation. There are, however, data that conflict with this simple model. Mutskov et al. (9Mutskov V. Gerber D. Angelov D. Ausio J. Workman J. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6293-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) have shown that hyperacetylated and hypoacetylated histone tails can associate almost equally well with DNA in chromatin at physiological salt concentrations. Mizuguchi et al. (10Mizuguchi G. Vassilev A. Tsukiyama T. Nakatani Y. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14773-14783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) show that hyperacetylation of histones alone does not stimulate transcription from the adenovirus E4 promoter. An alternative model proposes that the pattern and nature of histone tail modification provides a “code” that can be recognized by specific factors that then associate with the tail, thereby determining the functional consequence of the histone modification (11Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). The two models are not mutually exclusive.Circumstantial evidence suggests that transactivation of some promoters is associated with deacetylation. Treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 inhibitors, which results in hyperacetylation of histones, can decrease rather than increase transactivation at some promoters or result in no change at others (12Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). The HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate inhibits transactivation of the ovalbumin promoter by estrogen receptors (ERs) (13McKnight G.S. Hager L. Palmiter R.D. Cell. 1980; 22: 469-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and of the tyrosine aminotransferase promoter (14Plesko M. Hargrove J.L. Granner D.K. Chalkley R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13738-13744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the MMTV-LTR by glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) (15Bresnick E.H. John S. Berard D.S. LeFebvre P. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Deckert and Struhl (16Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) have recently shown that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae both acetylated and deacetylated histones H3 and H4 can be associated with transcriptionally active promoters.Our results demonstrate that at the MMTV-LTR there is a significant level of basal acetylation at the promoter when it is inactive that decreases during hormone activation. This differs from what has generally been found at mammalian gene promoters characterized thus far (7Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 17Cheung P., G., T.K. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), but it has been described at some yeast promoters (Refs. 16Deckert J. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2726-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,18Reinke H. Gregory P.D. Horz W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 529-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, and others). The experiments we describe significantly advance our understanding of the role of deacetylation in transcriptional regulation at the MMTV-LTR. The results suggest a mechanism by which steroid hormone-targeted promoter activity is regulated by the acetylation state of histones in addition to other proteins found at the promoter in response to stimuli that induce transactivation.RESULTSTo better understand the mechanisms that underlie chromatin remodeling and transactivation by steroid hormone receptors, we investigated the acetylation status of histones H3 and H4 in the MMTV promoter in response to steroid hormone receptor activation. The MMTV-LTR has six well defined positioned nucleosome families, designated nucleosomes (Nuc) A–F. NucA overlaps the TATA region and the transcription start site, and NucF is the farthest 5′ to the transcription start site (−1 kilobase) (Fig.1A) (22Fragoso G. John S. Roberts M.S. Hager G.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Fragoso G. Hager G.L. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 11: 246-252Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Four GR binding sites or hormone response elements (HREs) are located in the NucB region (Fig. 1 A). A nuclease hypersensitive site develops across NucB in response to glucocorticoid treatment, which indicates chromatin reorganization or remodeling at this nucleosome (24Payvar F. DeFranco D. Firestone G.L. Edgar B. Wrange O. Okret S. Gustafsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1983; 35: 381-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 25Richard-Foy H. Hager G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 26Fragoso G. Pennie W.D. John S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3633-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Just 5′ to NucB there are two HREs in the NucC region, and nuclease hypersensitivity extends into this nucleosome (26Fragoso G. Pennie W.D. John S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3633-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Fletcher T.M. Ryu B.-W. Baumann C.T. Warren B.S. Fragoso G. John S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6466-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Nuclease hypersensitive sites in promoters are generally associated with histone acetylation and with transcriptionally active promoters (28Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 29Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 30Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).We determined the acetylation level of histones H3 and H4 at NucB and NucF, located inside and outside the hypersensitive site, respectively (25Richard-Foy H. Hager G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). A difference in the acetylation status of histones at these two nucleosomes can indicate whether any observed changes are associated with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. The mouse adenocarcinoma cell line 1470.2 was treated with 100 nm Dex for 1 h. Nuclei were isolated and subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion. Acetylation status was determined using ChIPs assays with antibodies to acetylated lysines in H3 (Lys-9 and -14) and H4 (Lys-5, -8, -12, and -16). There is a significant level of basal acetylation of histone N-terminal tails H3 and H4 at both NucB and NucF prior to treatment with Dex (Fig. 1 B, −Dex). Dex treatment results in a decrease in H3 and H4 acetylation at NucB to about 50% of that seen in the untreated cells (Fig. 1, C andD). In striking contrast, at both H3 and H4 acetylation of NucF is not decreased but is somewhat increased by hormone treatment, indicating that deacetylation is associated with NucB and the nuclease hypersensitive site. It is unlikely that the decrease in acetylation is due to loss or sliding of NucB, as it was shown that GR-induced chromatin remodeling at the MMTV promoter does not involve either of these processes (26Fragoso G. Pennie W.D. John S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3633-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).To understand the kinetic relationship between transcription and deacetylation, a time course of both was carried out (Fig.2). Treatment of cells with Dex for as little as 15 min results in some deacetylation at NucB at histones H3 and H4; however, transcription has already reached its maximum. Deacetylation reaches its maximum at the 50% level after 30 min of treatment and persists after transcription decreases. By 15 min of treatment, histone acetylation at NucF is somewhat higher than that observed in untreated cells, as shown in Fig. 1, and does not change significantly at any time point (data not shown). These results indicate that deacetylation at NucB is associated with hormone-induce transcription but lags behind transcriptional activation, as deacetylation is still decreasing when transcription is maximal.Figure 2Time course of transcription and deacetylation at the MMTV-LTR. Nuclear run-on transcription assays were done on nuclei isolated from 1470.2 cells treated for 0, 15, 30, and 60 min with 100 nm Dex. For ChIP assays, 1470.2 cells were treated with Dex for the same times prior to formaldehyde cross-linking and processed as described in Fig. 1 legend. Relative levels of acetylated H3 (shaded bars) and acetylated H4 (hatched bars) are indicated on the left y axis. Levels of MMTV transcription (broken line) are expressed as fold induction with basal transcription (0 min) set to a value of 1 and are indicated on the right y axis. n = 3–6 for the ChIP analysis and 3–5 for the run-on analysis; error bars represent S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The progesterone receptor (PR) is closely related to the GR, binds to the same HREs, and can activate transcription from the MMTV-LTR. Like GR, stably expressed PR is able to induce hypersensitivity at NucB (19Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine whether the deacetylation at histones H3 and H4 is specific to the GR, cell line 3017.1(19), which expresses both GR and PR, was treated for 1 h with either Dex or the synthetic progestin R5020, and ChIP assays were done (Fig.3). Deacetylation is observed at both histones H3 and H4 when either GR or PR is activated in this cell line. We see very little change at NucF after hormone addition, as we observed in the 1470.2 cells. These results suggest that at the MMTV-LTR, related steroid hormone receptors regulate chromatin remodeling and transcription by a common mechanism that involves histone deacetylation.Figure 3PR can mediate deacetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the MMTV promoter. 3017.1 cells were treated for 1 h with either 100 nm Dex or 30 nm R5020. It was shown previously that R5020 does not activate the GR in these cells at the concentration used in these experiments (19Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A, after hormone treatment, ChIP assays with antibodies to acetylated histones H3 and H4 and PCR analysis of various fractions were done as described for Fig. 1. Control represents cells treated with vehicle only and shows the basal level of histone acetylation. “None” is the no antibody control.

Error barsrepresent S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONHistone acetylation within the proximal MMTV promoter region is significant prior to hormone activation, decreases as maximally activated transcription proceeds, and persists after the decline in transcription begins. The relatively high level of basal histone acetylation may facilitate the rapid onset of steroid hormone receptor-activated transcription and nuclease hypersensitivity at the MMTV promoter. Miziguchi et al. (10Mizuguchi G. Vassilev A. Tsukiyama T. Nakatani Y. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14773-14783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) report that histone hyperacetylation at an in vitro assembled chromatin template is not sufficient to cause increased transcription but synergistically facilitates transcription induced by the binding of an activator and the activity of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor, NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor). Additionally, maximal histone deacetylation at the MMTV promoter is achieved just prior to the decrease in transcription, which suggests that deacetylation plays a role in the down-regulation of activated transcription, consistent with the generally observed correlation between deacetylation and transcriptional repression. HDAC inhibitors can, however, decrease rather than increase transcription at the MMTV promoter (15Bresnick E.H. John S. Berard D.S. LeFebvre P. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) but not in a time-frame consistent with repression. 2C. L. Smith, unpublished observations.. It is thus possible that the HDAC inhibitors target a non-histone protein in which acetylation is inhibitory to transcriptional initiation. Acetylation of the non-histone coactivator protein ACTR (activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptors) coincides with inhibition of ER-mediated transcription (5Chen H., J., L.R. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar).The dynamic pattern of histone acetylation we observed at the MMTV promoter is different from two other systems examined in kinetic detail. Experiments with the estrogen-responsive cathepsin D and the pS2 promoters (5Chen H., J., L.R. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 7Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar) show low levels of histone acetylation prior to treatment with estradiol, which then rise and reach a peak just prior to the maximum of transcription at 60 min. Elevated levels of acetylation then persist to some degree as transcription declines and increases again. Reinke et al. (18Reinke H. Gregory P.D. Horz W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 529-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) describe a transient hyperacetylation at the PHO8 promoter in yeast that occurs prior to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation. However, unlike our observation at the MMTV-LTR, levels of acetylation did not drop below those observed prior to activation. The variety of acetylation patterns and the dynamics of timing observed in these promoter systems suggests that different genes utilize histone and non-histone protein acetylation in distinct ways to regulate transcriptional activity. The mechanisms by which acetylation functions in transcriptional regulation are likely more complex than simply electrostatic repulsion between acetylated histones and DNA, or a histone code that directs non-histone proteins to the promoter, and are not yet fully understood. The association of histone acetylation with transactivation, and deacetylation with repression, was first suggested in 1964 by Allfreyet al. (1Allfrey V. Faulkner R.M. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Such associations are now well documented in numerous studies (2Wolffe A.P. Guschin D. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 102-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 3Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 4Grunstein M.

Circumstantial evidence suggests that transactivation of some promoters is associated with deacetylation. Treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 inhibitors, which results in hyperacetylation of histones, can decrease rather than increase transactivation at some promoters or result in no change at others (12Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar). The HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate inhibits transactivation of the ovalbumin promoter by estrogen receptors (ERs) (13McKnight G.S. Hager L. Palmiter R.D.

The experiments we describe significantly advance our understanding of the role of deacetylation in transcriptional regulation at the MMTV-LTR. The results suggest a mechanism by which steroid hormone-targeted promoter activity is regulated by the acetylation state of histones in addition to other proteins found at the promoter in response to stimuli that induce transactivation. RESULTSTo better understand the mechanisms that underlie chromatin remodeling and transactivation by steroid hormone receptors, we investigated the acetylation status of histones H3 and H4 in the MMTV promoter in response to steroid hormone receptor activation. The MMTV-LTR has six well defined positioned nucleosome families, designated nucleosomes (Nuc) A–F. NucA overlaps the TATA region and the transcription start site, and NucF is the farthest 5′ to the transcription start site (−1 kilobase) (Fig.1A) (22Fragoso G. John S. Roberts M.S. Hager G.L.

Four GR binding sites or hormone response elements (HREs) are located in the NucB region (Fig. 1 A). A nuclease hypersensitive site develops across NucB in response to glucocorticoid treatment, which indicates chromatin reorganization or remodeling at this nucleosome (24Payvar F. DeFranco D.

Nuclease hypersensitive sites in promoters are generally associated with histone acetylation and with transcriptionally active promoters (28Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C.

Hager G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). A difference in the acetylation status of histones at these two nucleosomes can indicate whether any observed changes are associated with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. The mouse adenocarcinoma cell line 1470.2 was treated with 100 nm Dex for 1 h. Nuclei were isolated and subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion. Acetylation status was determined using ChIPs assays with antibodies to acetylated lysines in H3 (Lys-9 and -14) and H4 (Lys-5, -8, -12, and -16). There is a significant level of basal acetylation of histone N-terminal tails H3 and H4 at both NucB and NucF prior to treatment with Dex (Fig. 1 B, −Dex). Dex treatment results in a decrease in H3 and H4 acetylation at NucB to about 50% of that seen in the untreated cells (Fig. 1, C andD). In striking contrast, at both H3 and H4 acetylation of NucF is not decreased but is somewhat increased by hormone treatment, indicating that deacetylation is associated with NucB and the nuclease hypersensitive site. It is unlikely that the decrease in acetylation is due to loss or sliding of NucB, as it was shown that GR-induced chromatin remodeling at the MMTV promoter does not involve either of these processes (26Fragoso G. Pennie W.D. John S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3633-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).To understand the kinetic relationship between transcription and deacetylation, a time course of both was carried out (Fig.2). Treatment of cells with Dex for as little as 15 min results in some deacetylation at NucB at histones H3 and H4; however, transcription has already reached its maximum. Deacetylation reaches its maximum at the 50% level after 30 min of treatment and persists after transcription decreases. By 15 min of treatment, histone acetylation at NucF is somewhat higher than that observed in untreated cells, as shown in Fig. 1, and does not change significantly at any time point (data not shown). These results indicate that deacetylation at NucB is associated with hormone-induce transcription but lags behind transcriptional activation, as deacetylation is still decreasing when transcription is maximal.The progesterone receptor (PR) is closely related to the GR, binds to the same HREs, and can activate transcription from the MMTV-LTR. Like GR, stably expressed PR is able to induce hypersensitivity at NucB (19Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Fragoso G. Hager G.L. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 11: 246-252Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Four GR binding sites or hormone response elements (HREs) are located in the NucB region (Fig. 1 A). A nuclease hypersensitive site develops across NucB in response to glucocorticoid treatment, which indicates chromatin reorganization or remodeling at this nucleosome (24Payvar F. DeFranco D. Firestone G.L. Edgar B. Wrange O. Okret S. Gustafsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1983; 35: 381-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 25Richard-Foy H. Hager G.

Just 5′ to NucB there are two HREs in the NucC region, and nuclease hypersensitivity extends into this nucleosome (26Fragoso G. Pennie W.D. John S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3633-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Fletcher T.M. Ryu B.-W. Baumann C.T. Warren B.S. Fragoso G. John S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6466-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Nuclease hypersensitive sites in promoters are generally associated with histone acetylation and with transcriptionally active promoters (28Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 29Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1823-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 30Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We determined the acetylation level of histones H3 and H4 at NucB and NucF, located inside and outside the hypersensitive site, respectively (25Richard-Foy H. Hager G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). A difference in the acetylation status of histones at these two nucleosomes can indicate whether any observed changes are associated with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling. The mouse adenocarcinoma cell line 1470.2 was treated with 100 nm Dex for 1 h. Nuclei were isolated and subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion. Acetylation status was determined using ChIPs assays with antibodies to acetylated lysines in H3 (Lys-9 and -14) and H4 (Lys-5, -8, -12, and -16). There is a significant level of basal acetylation of histone N-terminal tails H3 and H4 at both NucB and NucF prior to treatment with Dex (Fig. 1 B, −Dex). Dex treatment results in a decrease in H3 and H4 acetylation at NucB to about 50% of that seen in the untreated cells (Fig. 1, C andD). In striking contrast, at both H3 and H4 acetylation of NucF is not decreased but is somewhat increased by hormone treatment, indicating that deacetylation is associated with NucB and the nuclease hypersensitive site. It is unlikely that the decrease in acetylation is due to loss or sliding of NucB, as it was shown that GR-induced chromatin remodeling at the MMTV promoter does not involve either of these processes (26Fragoso G. Pennie W.D. John S. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3633-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To understand the kinetic relationship between transcription and deacetylation, a time course of both was carried out (Fig.2). Treatment of cells with Dex for as little as 15 min results in some deacetylation at NucB at histones H3 and H4; however, transcription has already reached its maximum. Deacetylation reaches its maximum at the 50% level after 30 min of treatment and persists after transcription decreases. By 15 min of treatment, histone acetylation at NucF is somewhat higher than that observed in untreated cells, as shown in Fig. 1, and does not change significantly at any time point (data not shown). These results indicate that deacetylation at NucB is associated with hormone-induce transcription but lags behind transcriptional activation, as deacetylation is still decreasing when transcription is maximal. The progesterone receptor (PR) is closely related to the GR, binds to the same HREs, and can activate transcription from the MMTV-LTR. Like GR, stably expressed PR is able to induce hypersensitivity at NucB (19Smith C.L. Wolford R.G. O'Neill T. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 956-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine whether the deacetylation at histones H3 and H4 is specific to the GR, cell line 3017.1(19), which expresses both GR and PR, was treated for 1 h with either Dex or the synthetic progestin R5020, and ChIP assays were done (Fig.3). Deacetylation is observed at both histones H3 and H4 when either GR or PR is activated in this cell line. We see very little change at NucF after hormone addition, as we observed in the 1470.2 cells. These results suggest that at the MMTV-LTR, related steroid hormone receptors regulate chromatin remodeling and transcription by a common mechanism that involves histone deacetylation. DISCUSSIONHistone acetylation within the proximal MMTV promoter region is significant prior to hormone activation, decreases as maximally activated transcription proceeds, and persists after the decline in transcription begins. The relatively high level of basal histone acetylation may facilitate the rapid onset of steroid hormone receptor-activated transcription and nuclease hypersensitivity at the MMTV promoter. Miziguchi et al. (10Mizuguchi G. Vassilev A. Tsukiyama T. Nakatani Y. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14773-14783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) report that histone hyperacetylation at an in vitro assembled chromatin template is not sufficient to cause increased transcription but synergistically facilitates transcription induced by the binding of an activator and the activity of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor, NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor). Additionally, maximal histone deacetylation at the MMTV promoter is achieved just prior to the decrease in transcription, which suggests that deacetylation plays a role in the down-regulation of activated transcription, consistent with the generally observed correlation between deacetylation and transcriptional repression. HDAC inhibitors can, however, decrease rather than increase transcription at the MMTV promoter (15Bresnick E.H. John S. Berard D.S. LeFebvre P. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) but not in a time-frame consistent with repression. 2C. L. Smith, unpublished observations.. It is thus possible that the HDAC inhibitors target a non-histone protein in which acetylation is inhibitory to transcriptional initiation. Acetylation of the non-histone coactivator protein ACTR (activator of thyroid and retinoic acid receptors) coincides with inhibition of ER-mediated transcription (5Chen H., J., L.R. Xie W. Wilpitz D.

Elevated levels of acetylation then persist to some degree as transcription declines and increases again. Reinke et al. (18Reinke H. Gregory P.D. Horz W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 529-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) describe a transient hyperacetylation at the PHO8 promoter in yeast that occurs prior to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation. However, unlike our observation at the MMTV-LTR, levels of acetylation did not drop below those observed prior to activation. The variety of acetylation patterns and the dynamics of timing observed in these promoter systems suggests that different genes utilize histone and non-histone protein acetylation in distinct ways to regulate transcriptional activity. The mechanisms by which acetylation functions in transcriptional regulation are likely more complex than simply electrostatic repulsion between acetylated histones and DNA, or a histone code that directs non-histone proteins to the promoter, and are not yet fully understood.

Yeast two-hybrid screening for PRL-2-interacting proteins identified the β-subunit of Rab geranylgeranyltransferase II (βGGT II). The specific interaction of βGGT II with PRL-2 but not with PRL-1 or -3 occurred in yeast and HeLa cells. Chimeric PRL-1/-2 molecules were tested for their interaction with βGGT II, and revealed that the C-terminal region of PRL-2 is required for interaction, possibly the PRL variable region immediately preceeding the CAAX box. Additionally, PRL-2 prenylation is prequisite for βGGT II binding. As prenylated PRL-2 is localized to the early endosome, we propose that this is where the interaction occurs. PRL-2 is not a substrate for βGGT II, as isoprenoid analysis showed that PRL-2 was solely farnesylated in vivo. Co-expression of the α-subunit (α) of GGT II, βGGT II, and PRL-2 resulted in α/βGGT II heterodimer formation and prevented PRL-2 binding. Expression of PRL-2 alone inhibited the endogenous α/βGGT II activity in HeLa cells.

Prominent among a variety of prenylated proteins are numerous small GTP-binding proteins, including Ras, RhoB, and the Rab proteins, and prenylation is essential for their cellular functions in signal transduction and vesicle trafficking (2Seabra M.C. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Isoprenoid modification can be catalyzed by one of three different transferases, depending on the isoprenoid and the prenylation motif of the target protein. Farnesyltransferase (FT)1 and geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGT I) are α/β heterodimers which share a common α-subunit and utilize the C15 farnesyl or the C20 geranylgeranyl, respectively (3Reiss Y.

One candidate is RhoB, which is farnesylated and geranylgeranylated in cells, and a gain in the level of geranylgeranylated RhoB is observed upon FTI treatment (19Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C.

The nature and role of other farnesylated proteins that could account for the anti-tumorigenic effects of FTI need to be investigated.

The PRLs are unique among PTP superfamily members in possessing a C-terminal prenylation motif and being prenylated in vivo. Prenylated PRLs are found in the early endosome and at the plasma membrane (28Zeng Q. Si X. Horstmann H. Xu Y. Hong W. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Inhibition of prenylation, by treatment of cells with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, results in PRL translocation to the nucleus (28Zeng Q. Si X. Horstmann H. Xu Y. Hong W. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The prenylation motifs of the PRLs (CCIQ, CCVQ, CCVM) conform to either the CAAX motif preferentially recognized by FT or to the CCXX motif recognized by GGT II, although their relocalization in response to FT inhibition indicates that they are likely farnesylated proteins in vivo. The prenylation-dependent subcellular localization of the PRLs suggests that regulated prenylation is a mechanism which controls the access of these PTPs to early endosomal or nuclear substrates. Cellular substrates of the PRL phosphatases have not yet been identified, although PRL-1 interacts with a basic leucine zipper protein, ATF-7, and can dephosphorylate it in vitro (29Peters C.S. Liang X. Li S. Kannan S. Peng Y. Taub R. Diamond R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13718-13726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although the specific substrates of the PRLs are unknown, PRL expression is associated with two distinct cell processes. PRL-1 was first identified as an immediate early gene expressed in regenerating liver and in serum-treated fibroblasts, and overexpression of PRL-1 in NIH 3T3 cells results in cell transformation, suggesting that the gene product plays a role in proliferation (23Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 30Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Hsu J.-C. Melby A.E. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Another role for PRL-1 has been proposed in the development and maintenance of differentiating epithelial tissues, as it is expressed in several developing tissues in fetal rat, and in the adult rat is found in terminally differentiated cells such as renal tubular epithelium, bronchiolar epithelium of the lung, and in villus but not crypt enterocytes of the intestine (31Diamond R.H. Peters C. Jung S.P. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Taub R. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 1996; 271: G121-G129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,32Kong W. Swain G.P. Li S. Diamond R.H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G613-G621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, PRL-3 is specifically expressed in the differentiated epithelial cells of the villus but not in the proliferating crypt cells of the mouse small intestine (28Zeng Q. Si X. Horstmann H. Xu Y. Hong W. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Yeast-two hybrid screening was carried out to identify PRL-2 interacting proteins, the nature of which could give insight into the cellular role of this PTP. The β-subunit of a prenyltransferase, GGT II, was found to specifically interact with PRL-2. This was intriguing, as this enzyme is only known to prenylate Rab proteins. The association of βGGT II with PRL-2 in mammalian cells was confirmed, and found to depend on the prenylation status of PRL-2, even though PRL-2 was farnesylated in cells. Association also required a unique region of PRL-2 that is not present in PRL-1 or -3. We present evidence that the binding of PRL-2 and αGGT II to βGGT II is mutually exclusive, and propose that through displacement of αGGT II, PRL-2 may function as a regulator of Rab GGT II activity. The pAS2-1 vector (CLONTECH) was used to generate the yeast expression PRL-PTP plasmids. In general, the cDNAs encoding the full-length PRL-1, -2, and -3 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and each subcloned in-frame into BamHI andPstI cut pAS2-1 vector. The pXJ40-myc vector (a gift from V. Yu) was used to generate the PRL-PTP expression plasmids for use in transient transfections. A BamHI-XhoI fragment encoding each full-length PRL-PTP or a mutant PRL-2 lacking the four C-terminal amino acids (PRL-2(cd)) was excised from pGEX-KG-PRL-1, -2, -3 or pGEX-KG-PRL-2(cd) (28Zeng Q. Si X. Horstmann H. Xu Y. Hong W. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), respectively, and subcloned in-frame into pXJ40-myc. The plasmid pXJ40-myc-PRL-2(CSVQ) was generated by in-frame insertion into BamHI/XhoI-cut pXJ40-myc of a polymerase chain reaction fragment from amplification of PRL-2 using an appropriate forward primer incorporating a BamHI site, and a reverse primer with a nucleotide substitution giving the desired C165S mutation and an engineered XhoI site. To generate the PRL-1/-2 chimera expression plasmids, a PRL-1 or PRL-2 cDNA fragment was excised from pXJ40-myc-PRL-2 or pXJ40-myc-PRL-1 atEcoRII and/or AflII sites, and was replaced by the corresponding fragment from the other PRL-PTP. The βGGT II cDNA (lacking the nucleotides encoding the four N-terminal amino acids) was amplified from the pGADGH-GGT II-B plasmid and subcloned into an NcoI/XhoI-cut pGEX-KG vector. The βGGT II cDNA was then excised using NcoI and SacI flanking sites, and subcloned into anNcoI/SacI-cut pBKS-flag vector (a gift from S. Lin). The DNA encoding flag-βGGT II was released by digestion withEcoRI and SacI, and subcloned in-frame into pXJ40 to create pXJ40-flag-βGGT II. The rat αGGT II cDNA was a gift from M. C. Seabra and was subcloned in-frame into aBamHI/KpnI cut pXJ41-HA vector. All of the plasmids were sequenced prior to use. The interaction screen was performed essentially as recommended in theCLONTECH user manual. A HeLa cDNA library (CLONTECH) was transformed into the yeast strain Y190, which had been pretransformed with pAS2-1-PRL-2. The transformants were plated on His, Leu, and Trp− medium containing 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma). Plasmids were isolated from positive colonies that fulfilled all criteria, and retested. One plasmid that was consistently positive for interaction with PRL-2 was sequenced and compared against the Entrez data base using a Blast search, and was identified as the cDNA encoding the β-subunit of human GGT II. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The empty expression vector pXJ40-myc was used to normalize the amount of DNA in each transfection. After 24 h of culture, the cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cytosol fraction was prepared by passing the cells 6–8 times through a 26-gauge needle, followed by clarification of the lysate by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosol) was used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. For farnesyltransferase inhibition, 10 µm FTI-277 (a gift from S. M. Sebti) (33Lerner E.C. Qian Y. Blaskovich M.A. Fossum R.D. Vogt A. Sun J. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26802-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum was added to the cells 5 h after transfection. Anti-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz) and anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Typically the lysates were incubated with the specific antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunofluorescence was carried out using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Myc antibody as described (28Zeng Q. Si X. Horstmann H. Xu Y. Hong W. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pXJ40-myc vector (mock) or pXJ40-myc-PRL-2 (PRL-2) for 18 h prior to harvest. Cell lysate was prepared by scraping the cells into lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then passing the cells 6–8 times through a 26-gauge needle. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as the source of GGT II. The in vitro enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding 80 µg of cell lysate to buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2 µm[3H]GGPP (22 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and with or without 2 µm Rab3a protein (Calbiochem). The 50-µl reaction was incubated at 30 °C and stopped after 4 h by adding SDS sample buffer, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to hyperfilm at −80 °C for 2 weeks and the labeled Rab3a protein was quantified by densitometry. 1-[3H]Mevalonolactone (40 Ci/mmol, [3H]MVA) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. HeLa cells were maintained and transfected with pXJ40-myc-PRL-2, and treated with or without FTI-277, as described above. For the final 18 h, cells were treated with [3H]MVA at 100 µCi/ml and 30 µm lovastatin (Calbiochem). Cell lysate was prepared by scraping the cells into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then passing the cells 6–8 times through a 26-gauge needle. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used to isolate myc-PRL-2 by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz). The immunoprecipitate was washed twice with acetone and CHCl3/MeOH, 1:2 (v/v) at −20 °C, dried by vacuum centrifugation, and processed for isoprenoid analysis as described by Casey et al. (6Casey P.J. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8323-8327Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The final dried sample was dissolved in 60 µl of 50% CH3CN, 25 mm H3PO4 (solvent A), and a portion was injected onto a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column. The column was eluted with a 4-ml linear gradient of solvent A to 100% CH3CN, 25 mm H3PO4(solvent B), followed by 1 ml of solvent B at a flow rate of 100 µl/min. Fractions of 100 µl were collected and their radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. Trans,trans-farnesol (FOH, Sigma) and all-trans-geranylgeraniol (GGOH, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.) were used as elution standards. To identify PRL-2 interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with full-length PRL-2 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain as bait. The expression of the fusion protein in Y190 yeast cells was verified by immunoblotting (data not shown). A human HeLa cell cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activating domain under the control of the constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase 1 promoter was transfected into Y190 cells that expressed DNA-binding domain-PRL-2. Ten million colonies were selected on medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His and supplemented with 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Among others, one colony was identified that showed growth on the selective medium and β-galactosidase activity, indicative of an interaction between PRL-2 and a library protein in these cells. The plasmid was isolated and sequenced. The insert was in-frame with the cDNA that coded for the human GGT II β-subunit. PRL-2 is a member of a group of three closely related proteins which also includes PRL-1 and PRL-3 (23Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell.

In order to test the specificity of the interaction of PRL-2 with the β-subunit of GGT II, we used PRL-1 and PRL-3 as bait and co-transfected the yeast with a plasmid expressing GAL4(DNA-binding domain)-βGGT II. The expression of the fusion proteins in Y190 yeast cells was verified by immunoblotting (data not shown). Despite the high homology between different PRL-PTP family members, only PRL-2 interacted with the GGT II β subunit in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig.1). As GGT II is a prenyltransferase, we also tested the dependence of the interaction on the presence of the C-terminal prenylation sequence, the CAAX box, of PRL-2. A prenylation-deficient mutant of PRL-2 lacking the CAAX box, PRL-2(cd), did not interact with βGGT II (Fig. 1). To validate the yeast two-hybrid results, we examined the in vivo interaction of PRL-2, -1, or -3 and βGGT II in mammalian cells. HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with Myc-tagged PRLs and FLAG-tagged βGGT II. Since βGGT II is a soluble protein mainly localized in the cytosol (10Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14497-14503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), non-detergent-extracted soluble fractions from the HeLa cells were used to carry out anti-Myc and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations. Virtually all the expressed βGGT II was indeed present in this soluble cytosolic fraction (Fig.2A, upper panel, comparelanes 1–4 with lanes 5–8). More PRL-2 was present in the cytosol than in the pellet (Fig. 2 A, lower panel, compare lanes 3 and 7), while about one-third of the PRL-1 partitioned into the cytosol (Fig. 2 A, lower panel, compare lanes 2 and 6). However, comparatively less of the total PRL-3 was found in the soluble extracts (Fig. 2 A, lower panel, compare lanes 4and 8). PRL-2 and βGGT II co-immunoprecipitated with one another, as evidenced by the presence of FLAG-βGGT II in Myc-PRL-2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 B, lane 6), and by the presence of Myc-PRL-2 in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 C, lane 6). No βGGT II was detected in myc-PRL-1 immunoprecipitates and Myc-PRL-1 was not present in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2,B and C, lane 5). Likewise, no association was detected between PRL-3 and βGGT II (Fig. 2, B and C, lane 7). These results confirm the in vivo interaction of PRL-2 and βGGT II and demonstrate that this involves specific features or properties of PRL-2. PRL-2 is localized in the early endosome compartment in a prenylation-dependent manner (28Zeng Q. Si X. Horstmann H. Xu Y. Hong W. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In transfected CHO cells and NIH 3T3 cells, PRL-2 showed strong perinuclear staining and weak plasma membrane staining visualized by immunofluorescence. A prenylation-deficient PRL-2 mutant was redirected to the nucleus and a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, FTI-277, caused the same nuclear relocalization (28Zeng Q. Si X. Horstmann H. Xu Y. Hong W. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We found essentially the same results in transiently transfected HeLa cells, but with enhanced diffuse cytoplasmic staining of expressed wild-type PRL-2 following treatment with FTI-277, and of expressed PRL-2(cd) (Fig.3). The readily apparent cytoplasmic staining may reflect a higher level of PRL-2 expression in transiently transfected HeLa cells compared to that in the stably transfected CHO and NIH 3T3 cells. Together these results indicate that prenylation plays an important role in the subcellular localization of PRL-2. To determine whether the linked properties of PRL-2 prenylation status and subcellular localization affect its interaction with GGT II, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out from lysates of HeLa cells expressing FLAG-tagged βGGT II and Myc-tagged PRL-2 or PRL-2(cd) mutant. As observed in previous experiments, the prenylated and early endosome-localized wild-type PRL-2 and βGGT II co-immunoprecipitated with one another (Fig.4A, lanes 4 and 7). However, the non-prenylated PRL-2(cd) mutant failed to interact with βGGT II (Fig. 4 A, lanes 5 and 8). The lack of interaction cannot merely be due to physically separate pools of cytoplasmic βGGT II and nuclear PRL-2(cd), as some PRL-2(cd) is present in the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 3) and likely represents the soluble PRL-2(cd) protein that was extracted together with soluble βGGT II (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). Likewise, in the yeast two-hybrid system we observed that the prenylation deficient mutant PRL-2(cd) did not interact with βGGT II, despite these expressed proteins being directed to the yeast nucleus (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, wild-type PRL-2 did interact with βGGT II in the yeast nucleus (Fig.1). These results suggested that co-localization of PRL-2 and βGGT II is not sufficient for interaction, and that the early endosomal localization of PRL-2 per se is not required for the physical association of PRL-2 and βGGT II in vivo. However, prenylation or the C-terminal prenylation sequence of PRL-2 is necessary for interaction. To distinguish between these latter possibilities, we investigated the association between βGGT II and prenylated PRL-2 or unprenylated PRL-2 possessing the CAAX box. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with PRL-2 and βGGT II in the presence or absence of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor FTI-277 for 16 h prior to harvest. Whole cell lysates were prepared and co-immunoprecipitations performed. Once again, wild-type PRL-2 from FTI-277 untreated cells was observed to interact with the GGT II β-subunit as visualized by immunoblotting (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and 7). Upon treatment with FTI-277, the expression level of PRL-2 was virtually unchanged (Fig.4 B, lanes 1 and 2) but the association with the GGT II β-subunit was lost (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5 and8). This was consistent with the study of PRL-2(cd) described above, and indicated that not only the CAAX box, but modification of PRL-2 by prenylation was required for interaction. As prenylated PRL-2 is in the early endosome and not in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus, this is the subcellular pool of PRL-2 that can interact with βGGT II. It is well documented that GGT II is a prenyltransferase that recognizes the prenylation motifs of XXCC, CXC, or CCXX, and whose exclusive substrates are Rab GTPases (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). The C-terminal prenylation motif of PRL-2, CCVQ, fits the CCXX sequence recognized by geranylgeranyltransferase II or the CAAX motif recognized by farnesyltransferase or GGT I. Indeed, PRL-2 can be geranylgeranylated or farnesylated in vitro (25Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A. Burke Y.D. Randall S.K. Crowell P.L. Crowell D.N. Canc.

To examine the possibility that prenylation of PRL-2 by GGT II was involved in the interaction of these proteins, we examined the lipid modification of PRL-2 in vivo. HeLa cells transiently expressing Myc-tagged PRL-2 were labeled with the isoprenoid precursor [3H]mevalonolactone, and isoprenoid analysis of the immunoprecipitated PRL-2 carried out. SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of the PRL-2 immunoprecipitate revealed that PRL-2 was labeled, and that it contained the majority of the label in the immunoprecipitate (Fig.5A, lane 2).

The basis for these applications is the remarkably strong affinity of the lectin for the tumor-associated Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T-antigen) and more so due to its ability to distinguish T-antigen from its cryptic forms. The crystal structure of the complex of peanut agglutinin with T-antigen reveals the basis of this specificity. Among the contacts involved in providing this specificity toward T-antigen is the water-mediated interaction between the side chain of Asn-41 and the carbonyl oxygen of the acetamido group of the second hexopyranose ring of the sugar molecule. Site-directed mutational changes were introduced at this residue with the objective of probing the role of this residue in T-antigen binding and possibly engineering an altered species with increased specificity for T-antigen. Of the three mutants tested, i.e. N41A, N41D, and N41Q, the last one shows improved potency for recognition of T-antigen. The affinities of the mutants can be readily explained on the basis of the crystal structure of the complex and simple modeling. In particular, the change of asparagine to glutamine could lead to a direct interaction of the side chain with the sugar while at the same time retaining the water bridge. This study strengthens the theory that in lectins the nonprimary contacts generally made through water bridges are involved in imparting exquisite specificity.

They are mostly multivalent in their sugar binding characteristics thus functioning as cellular adhesives in a range of biological systems and are put to use in biomedical research as carbohydrate-selective probes based on the binding to surface sugars (1Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins: Properties, Functions and Applications in Biology and Medicine. Academic Press, London1986Google Scholar, 2Sharon N. Lis H. Lectins. Chapman and Hall, London1989Crossref Google Scholar). Plant lectins have no clearly defined function, but a number of them have been implicated in defense-related roles (3Peumans W.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Although a global utilization for them has not been identified, a number of lectins have shown great potential in clinical applications. Peanut agglutinin in particular has displayed immense utility for the screening of mature and immature thymocytes prior to bone marrow transplantation (4Reisner Y. Biniaminov M. Rosenthal E. Sharon N. Ramot B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) as well as in the detection of cancerous malignancies (5Zebda N. Bailly M. Brown S. Dores J.F. Berthier-Vergnes O. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The status of PNA1 as a valuable clinical tool has been recognized largely based on its strong affinity for the tumor-associated T-antigenic disaccharide (Galβ1→3GalNAc, Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen), which is of non-oncofetal origin. The other anti-T probes, amaranthin and jacalin, are not as useful and convenient because they are unable to discriminate between the more abundant cryptic T- and Tn-antigens (GalNAcα-O-Ser/Thr), which are sialylated derivatives of the of the T- and Tn-antigens, respectively (6Lotan R.

A member of the legume lectin family, PNA is a homotetramer with an unusual open quaternary structure (6Lotan R. Skutelsky E. Danon D. Sharon N. J. Biol.

This 110-kDa lectin binds to carbohydrates by means of conserved residues used by other members of this family as well as a few that are specific to itself. These amino acids are distributed within the binding pocket in four distinct loops designated A, B, C, and D found in all legume lectins (10Sharma V. Surolia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 21209-21213Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar).

The molecular basis of carbohydrate specificity for PNA was delineated at atomic resolution initially as a complex with lactose, which is involved in nine hydrogen bonds with the residues emanating from the four loops (9Bannerjee R. Mande S.C. Ganesh V. Das K. Dhanraj V. Mahanta S.K. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 14Bannerjee R. Das K. Ravishankar R. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The galactose residue of lactose is tethered to the protein through hydrogen bonds and water bridges as well as a stacking interaction with a tyrosyl residue from loop C. The PNA-T-antigen crystal structure (15Ravishankar R. Ravindran M. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Curr. Sci. 1997; 72: 855-861Google Scholar) solved subsequently revealed the similarity in the mode of binding of T-antigen and lactose. Notwithstanding the similarities, the 20-fold higher affinity for T-antigen is contributed by the liganding contacts mediated by two additional water bridges. These water molecules, although present in the binding site of the PNA-lactose complex, are not engaged in any bonding interactions between the protein and the sugar (15Ravishankar R. Ravindran M. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Curr. Sci. 1997; 72: 855-861Google Scholar). Among these, one molecule links Ile-101, while the other links both Asn-41 and Leu-212 of PNA with the carbonyl oxygen of the acetamido group of the β1→3-linked GalNAc residue of the T-antigenic disaccharide. The Leu-212 residue was probed by site-directed mutagenesis for its role in the binding of T-antigen at a time when the structure of the complex of PNA and T-antigen had not been solved. This was attempted based on its proximity to theN-acetyl group of T-antigen as visualized from the PNA-lactose structure and was thereafter proven to be critical in the binding of this sugar (16Sharma V. Vijayan M. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21209-21213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Subsequently the solution of the complex of PNA with T-antigen confirmed the importance of this residue and revealed the participation of the same water molecule in linking both Leu-212 and Asn-41 to T-antigen (15Ravishankar R.

The conjugate consists of poly[N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-acrylamide] polymer to which ω-aminoalkyl-α-glycoside of T-antigenic disaccharide (Galβ1→3GalNAcα1-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2) and biotin are conjugated (18Bovin N.V.

Concentration of rPNA and its various mutants were determined by the absorbance of their solutions, i.e. A1%280 = 7.7 (6Lotan R. Skutelsky E. Danon D. Sharon N. J. Biol.

Concentrations of sugars were determined by weight. Selected mutational changes at Asn-41 were generated through polymerase chain reaction splicing by overlap extension (19Horton R.M. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 15: PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 251-261Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotides used to generate the mutated PNA species are shown in Table I. After the desired mutation was established in the PNA gene they were transferred into the same expression context as that of the WT PNA gene in pBSH-PN. Transformants were then screened for the desired recombinants by restriction analysis, first to check for the presence of insert and subsequently to check for the presence of the preengineered restriction site change directly linked to the specific mutational change selected for (Table I). Sequencing of the entire polymerase chain reaction-generated area was performed for all identified mutant clones to ensure the presence of the desired change and the absence of any second site changes (20Ausubel F.M.

Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) These assays were performed with human O+ red blood cells as previously described (22Sharma V. Surolia A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 148: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For inhibition assays, the protein was preincubated with the sugar being tested for 1 h at room temperature prior to the addition of red blood cells at a final concentration of 1%. The amount of protein used in the assays was 4–8 times the previously established value for the minimum hemagglutination concentration. The minimum inhibitory concentration for a particular sugar was recorded at the first well showing complete inhibition of hemagglutination. Surface plasmon resonance analysis was performed using a BIAcore 2000TM (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) biosensor system. The T-antigen as a biotinylated derivative containing a polyacrylamide spacer arm between the biotin and the sugar moiety was immobilized on a streptavidin chip. Nearly 400 response units of T-antigen (0.1 mg/ml in 50 mmphosphate-buffered saline) were coupled to the chip at a flow rate of 1 µl/min for 50 min. All measurements were done using the running buffer (20 mm phosphate-buffered saline). All protein samples were dialyzed extensively in the same buffer prior to injection. For determination of on rates, recombinant PNA or the mutant species were perfused over the sensor chip containing biotinylated T-antigen (0.5–0.03 µm) at a flow rate of 5 µl/min until equilibration was attained. Subsequently the off rates were determined by passing a solution of lactose (5 mm) in the same buffer at a flow rate of 50 µl/min. The surface was regenerated by a 5-s pulse of NaOH (1 mm) flowing at 50 µl/min. Association (k1) and dissociation (k−1) rate constants were obtained by nonlinear fitting of the primary sensorgram data using the BIA evaluation software, Version 3.0. The dissociation rate constant is derived using the equation: Rt=Rt0e−k−1(t−t0)Equation 1 where Rt is the response at timet, Rt0 is the amplitude of the initial response, and k−1 is the dissociation rate constant. The association rate constantk1 can be derived using Eq. 2 from the measuredk−1 values. Rt−Rmax(1−e−(k1C+k−1)(t−t0))Equation 2 where Rt is the response at timet, Rmax is the maximum response,C is the concentration of the analyte in the solution,kon is the association rate constant, andkoff is the dissociation rate constant.Ka(k1/k−1) is the association constant, and Kd(k−1/k1) is the dissociation constant. The coordinates of subunit A in the peanut lectin-T-antigen complex (PDB code 2TEP) were used for the modeling studies. Asn-41 was mutated to Gln, Asp, and Ala using the model-building software FRODO. The mutated coordinate set was loaded in INSIGHT II. The MODIFY option in the BUILDER module was used to modify the dihedrals χ1, χ2, and χ31of Gln (χ1 and χ21 in the case of Asp-41) at 10° intervals. At each combination of χ1, χ2, and χ31 (χ1 and χ21 in the case of Asp-41), side chain contacts with sugar atoms and water oxygens (W1, W2, W3, and W4) were evaluated. The hexopyranosyl residues of both lactose and T-antigen share an identical pattern of hydrogen bonds, nonpolar interactions, etc. with PNA. The higher affinity of PNA for T-antigen was ascribed to two additional water bridges it has with the protein over those observed with lactose (15Ravishankar R. Ravindran M. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Curr. Sci. 1997; 72: 855-861Google Scholar, 17Ravishankar R. Suguna K. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These water-mediated contacts are established via Asn-41, Ile-101, and Leu-212 and the carbonyl oxygen of the acetamido group of the reducing end GalNAc residue of T-antigen as illustrated in Fig. 1. To address the role of one such water-mediated hydrogen bond viz. between Asn-41 and carbonyl oxygen of the acetamido group of the reducing end sugar (GalNAc) in T-antigen in the generation of the carbohydrate specificity of PNA, Asn-41 was mutated to a shorter uncharged nonpolar alanine residue and to two conserved amino acids, namely aspartic acid and glutamine. The generation of N41A, N41D, and N41Q mutants were linked with the creation of a NheI, AccI, andRsaI site in the WT rPNA sequence (TableI). The mutants were confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing. rPNA and all the mutants when expressed and purified showed a single band on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Mr = 27,000). rPNA and all the mutants also eluted at the position corresponding to that of the WT PNA tetramer. All the PNA species could hemagglutinate desialylated red blood cells to comparable levels. Also all of them were inhibitable with galactose and its derivatives indicating that none of these mutations destabilize the carbohydrate binding pocket (TableII).Table IIHemagglutination assay of PNA and its mutantsPNA speciesMHC2-aMHC, minimum hemagglutination concentration.GalMeαGalMeβGalLactoseLacNAcT-antigenµg/mlmmrPNA0.34.51.01.51.560.12N41A0.34.52.01.51.5612.0N41D0.34.51.01.51.560.48N41Q0.34.51.01.51.560.03Values represent hemagglutinating activity of wild-type and mutant PNAs using desialylated human O+ red blood cells.

Hemagglutination inhibition studies show the binding of the various monosaccharides, lactose, and N-acetyllactosamine to the three mutants to be unaltered when compared with WT PNA. Nevertheless, when assayed for T-antigen binding, N41A shows markedly reduced inhibition when compared with the marginal decrease seen for N41D, whereas N41Q shows a 4-fold increase in the binding affinity (Tables II and III).Table IIIKinetics for the binding of rPNA and its mutants to immobilized T-antigenPNA specieskonkoffKa× 105m−1s−1s−1m−1rPNA5.9 (± 0.15)0.03 (± 0.0007)1.96N41ANo bindingNo bindingNo bindingN41D3.5 (± 0.11)0.05 (± 0.001)0.70N41Q6.3 (± 0.012)0.02 (± 0.0008)3.15Values in parentheses indicate standard errors.

The binding characteristics of the mutants and WT protein were complemented with surface plasmon resonance studies, which helped to determine quantitatively the sugar binding affinities of mutants with respect to rPNA (23Jönnsson U.

Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For this assay, biotinylated T-antigen was immobilized on a streptavidin chip followed by the injection of the protein. Sensorgrams of the concentration-dependent binding of rPNA and its mutants to immobilized T-antigen provide an estimate of the kinetic parameters involved in the interaction (Fig.2, A–D; Table III). The on rate (k1) obtained for the binding of rPNA was in the range of values observed for carbohydrate-lectin interactions in general. The N41A mutant when passed over immobilized T-antigen showed no detectable change in response units. This is not surprising in view of the inability of this mutation to accommodate T-antigen in its binding site. N41D showed a marginal decrease in its association rate constant as well as its overall binding constant (3.5 × 10−3m−1 s−1 and 7.0 × 104m−1, respectively). On the other hand, although N41Q exhibited a marginal increase in its on rate when compared with rPNA, a lowered off rate (k−1) contributes to a 1.6-fold elevation in its overall binding constant (Table III, Ka = 3.15 × 105m−1). Subsequently the sugars, whose binding affinities to the PNA species had to be estimated, were preincubated with the desired protein and passed over the immobilized T-antigen. The sugar binding affinity determined the extent and rate of binding of rPNA and its mutant counterparts to the immobilized T-antigen (Fig.3). The concentration of the sugars required for 50% inhibition in the on rates (k1) for the binding of various sugars to rPNA and its mutant counterparts defines their potencies of binding to the lectin and its mutant counterparts.Figure 3A, inhibition of the binding of rPNA to immobilized T-antigen by various sugars.

These studies show that while all the mutants retain their relative ligand binding affinities for the monosaccharides tested (methyl-α-galactose and methyl-β-galactose) as well as the disaccharides such as lactose andN-acetyllactosamine, binding to T-antigen was affected in a considerable manner. Thus the N41D mutant had 4 times diminished affinity for T-antigen, whereas N41Q was 6 times more potent a receptor for the same disaccharide. A marked diminution in the affinity of N41A for T-antigen is also borne out by the fact that the appropriate sensorgrams for its binding to the immobilized T-antigen could not be obtained (Fig. 2D). The structure and simple modeling studies provide a rationale for the activities of the mutants. The T-antigen molecule and the water bridges it makes with the wild-type lectin subunit A of the crystal structure of the complex are illustrated in Fig.4A. Four water molecules, W1, W2, W3, and W4, are involved in the bridges. Those involving W1 and W2 are common to the lactose and the T-antigen complexes. W3 and W4 are also present in both the complexes, but only T-antigen, on account of the presence of the acetamido group, is capable of using them for water bridges. The water bridge involving Asn-41 is altogether abolished when it is mutated to alanine, leading to the decreased affinity of the sugar to the lectin. Furthermore, the removal of the side chain amide group opens up the lectin-sugar interface containing the water bridges to the solvent, which again could adversely affect binding affinity. The carboxylate and the amide groups are similar in geometry, and the replacement of the latter by the former as in N41D cannot lead to drastic effects as in N41A. However, in the water bridge, for the same N … O and O … O distance, the former hydrogen bond would be weaker than the latter. This distance cannot be substantially reduced by a change in side chain conformation as the side chain of the residue is nearly as extended as it could be. Thus the mutation of Asn-41 to Asp could somewhat weaken the water bridge involving W4. There are of course instances where a change from asparagine to aspartic acid has led to substantially larger effects (10Sharma V. Surolia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 21209-21213Crossref Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 25Mirkov T.E. Chrispeels M.J. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 26van Eijsden R.R.

The mutation of Asn-41 to Gln is extremely interesting as it leads to increased affinity of the lectin to T-antigen. In a simple modeling study, the side chain of Asn-41 was replaced by that of Gln, and the three conformational angles χ1,χ2, and χ31 were systematically varied at regular intervals. This led to a very satisfactory situation, illustrated in Fig.4B, at χ1 = −55, χ2 = −65, and χ31 = 35, which correspond to a highly plausible conformation. At these angles, the amide nitrogen forms a direct hydrogen bond with W4. Furthermore, the glutaminyl side chain now forms hydrogen bonds with W3 as well. The enhancement of hydrogen-bonded interactions naturally leads to the enhanced affinity of the mutant for the sugar. All the changes in the interactions resulting from mutations involve the acetamido group, which is present only in T-antigen among the sugars studied. Therefore, the affinity of the lectin to the other sugars remains unaffected. In summary, these data highlight the importance of the water-mediated hydrogen bonds between the sugar atoms and functional groups in PNA in determining the exquisite specificity of the lectin for the tumor-associated T-antigenic structure. Furthermore these studies also demonstrate how three-dimensional structure can guide mutation analysis and rationalize the results of the analysis."

Although human TNF (hTNF) and murine TNF (mTNF) are very homologous, hTNF binds only to mTNF-RI. By measuring the binding of a panel of mTNF/hTNF chimeras to both mTNF-R, we pinpointed the TNF region that mediates the interaction with mTNF-RII. Using site-specific mutagenesis, we identified amino acids 71–73 and 89 as the main interacting residues. Mutein hTNF-S71D/T72Y/H73Δ/T89E interacts with both types of mTNF-R and is active in CT6 cell proliferation assays mediated by mTNF-RII. Mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T binds to mTNF-RI only and is no longer active on CT6 cells. However, the L929s cytotoxicity of this mutein (an effect mediated by mTNF-RI triggering) was also 100-fold lower than that of wild-type mTNF due to enhanced dissociation during incubation at subnanomolar concentrations. The additional mutation of amino acid 102, resulting in the mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T/P102Q, restored the trimer stability, which led to an enhanced specific activity on L929s cells. Hence the specific activity of a TNF species is governed not only by its receptor binding characteristics but also by its trimer stability after incubation at subnanomolar concentrations. In conclusion, the mutation of TNF amino acids 71–73, 89, and 102 is sufficient to obtain a mTNF mutein selective for mTNF-RI and a hTNF mutein that, unlike wild-type hTNF, also acts on mTNF-RII.

It exerts both direct and indirect antitumor effects on a number of tumors in vivo. However, its therapeutic application in the treatment of tumors is severely hampered by pathogenic side effects such as hypotension and liver toxicity (4Brouckaert P. Libert C. Cauwels A.

The multiple biological effects of TNF are mediated by two cell surface TNF receptors (TNF-Rs), namely TNF-RI and TNF-RII (5Tartaglia L.A. Weber R.F. Figari I.S. Reynolds C.

Moreover, receptor-specific muteins of hTNF have been obtained by mutating amino acids located at the intersubunit grooves (8Van Ostade X. Tavernier J. Prangé T. Fiers W.

Although murine TNF (mTNF) and human TNF (hTNF) are 79% identical at the amino acid level, hTNF interacts with mTNF-RI but not with mTNF-RII. Due to the high homology, chimeric TNF genes can be obtained by exchanging homologous regions between the hTNF and mTNF genes. Bacterial expression of such in-frame chimeric genes results in chimeric TNF subunits that are able to trimerize into bioactive molecules. These chimeric proteins are subsequently used to localize the epitopes for species-specific TNF monoclonal antibodies (11Tavernier J. Marmenout A. Bauden R. Hauquier G. Van Ostade X. Fiers W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We created and characterized different mTNF/hTNF chimeras to identify the region(s) responsible for interaction with mTNF-RII. Subsequently we obtained receptor-specific muteins by replacing murine amino acids in this region by their human counterparts and vice versa. This resulted in a mTNF-RI-specific mutein of mTNF and a hTNF mutein also binding efficiently to mTNF-RII. Recombinant mTNF and hTNF were produced in our laboratory and had a specific biological activity of 2.1 × 108 and 6.7 × 107 units/mg, respectively. TNF muteins were purified to near homogeneity as described previously (11Tavernier J. Marmenout A. Bauden R. Hauquier G. Van Ostade X. Fiers W. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The extracellular domains of mTNF-RI and mTNF-RII were expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 system and purified as follows. The cell supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (20–80% cut). The pellet was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and passed over a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The flow-through with soluble receptors was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.3), applied on an SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. Peak fractions had a purity of >90% as measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Expression and purification of bivalent chimeric proteins formed with the Fc region of human IgG1 and the ligand-binding domains of hTNF-RI (hTNF-RI/Fc) or hTNF-RII (hTNF-RII/Fc) were described previously (12Crowe P.D.

The oligonucleotides used were 5′-CTAGTGGTaCCAtCaGAgGGGTTGTAC-3′ (A52S/D53E, +KpnI), 5′-TTGTACCTTaTaTACTCCCAG-3′ (V58I, −AccI), 5′-TGCCCCtcCacccACGTGCTCCTCACC-3′ (D71S/Y72T/Δ73H, +PmlI), 5′-GACTACGTGCTgTTAACCCACACCaTCAGCCGATTT-3′ (V80I, +HpaI), 5′-AGCCGAaTcGCgATCTCATAC-3′ (F83I, +NruI), 5′-CGATTTGCggTCTCATACC-3′ (I85V, +BsaI), 5′-TCATACCAGaCGAAAGTtAACCTC-3′ (E89T, +HpaI), and 5′-AAGAGCCCCTGCCaAAGGACACC-3′ (P102Q, −StyI) (lowercase, altered nucleotides; italics, new codons). To mutate the hTNF gene, we used the bacterial expression plasmid pMaT4HTNFt (15Van Ostade X. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and the oligonucleotides 5′-GGCTGCCCCgactacGTaCTCCTCACC-3′ (S71D/T72Y/H73Δ, +SnaBI) and 5′-CTCCTACCAGgagAAGGTtAACCTCCTC-3′ (T89E, +HpaI) (lowercase, altered nucleotides; italics, new codons). Mutant clones were screened for the presence of a newly created (or eliminated) restriction site and were confirmed by sequence analysis. L929s murine fibrosarcoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) (16Vanhaesebroeck B. Decoster E. Van Ostade X. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Van Roy F. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2785-2794PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at 30,000 cells/well. The next day a serial dilution of TNF in the above medium and 1 μg/ml actinomycin D were added. After an 18-h incubation, the number of surviving cells was determined with 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (17Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar). CT6 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (complete RPMI) containing 10% EL4 thymoma supernatant. Growth induction on CT6 was determined as described previously (18Ranges G.E. Bombara M.P. Aiyer R.A. Rice G.G. Palladino Jr., M.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1203-1208PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown for 3 days in complete RPMI plus 5% EL4 supernatant, and they were subsequently seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at 50,000 cells/well. After a 1-h preincubation, a serial dilution of TNF was added to the cells. After incubation for 24 h, the assay plates were pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well and further incubated for 5 h. The cells were harvested, and the incorporated label was measured. Purified TNF proteins were radiolabeled using Iodogen iodination agent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce Chemicals). Labeled proteins were separated from unincorporated radioactivity on a G-25 column (PD10,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and had a specific radioactivity of 10–50 μCi/μg. Gel filtration was performed on a Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and eluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% NaN3 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions of 0.3 ml were collected and tested for radioactivity in a γ-counter. Gel filtration chromatography was performed at 4 °C. TNF binding to soluble TNF receptors was measured in a BIAcore apparatus (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). A flow of HEPES-buffered saline (10 mm HEPES, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) passing over the sensor surfaces was maintained at 10 μl/min. The carboxylated dextran matrix of the sensor-chip flow cell was activated by the injection of 50 μl of a solution containing 0.2 mN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide in water. Then 50 μl of 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) as such or containing 25 μg/ml purified soluble murine TNF-R (smTNF-R) I, smTNF-RII, hTNF-RI/Fc, or hTNF-RII/Fc were passed over one flow cell. The remaining binding sites were blocked by injection of 50 μl of 1m ethanolamine (pH 8.5). The surface plasmon resonance signal after immobilization of smTNF-RI or smTNF-RII generated 800 or 870 response units (see Fig. 2, A and B) and 1654 or 1381 response units (Fig. 2, C–F). Immobilization of hTNF-RI/Fc (Fig. 2G) or hTNF-RII/Fc generated 5500 and 5650 response units, respectively. To characterize TNF binding, a TNF solution was passed over differently coated sensor-chip flow cells (association phase) followed by HEPES-buffered saline (dissociation phase). The changes in response between control cells and cells coated with smTNF-R were measured and represented in sensorgrams. The theoretical three-dimensional structure of mTNF muteins was constructed by homology modeling using the computer program Swiss-Model (19Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of mTNF (20Baeyens K.J. De Bondt H.L. Raeymaekers A. Fiers W. De Ranter C.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was obtained from a protein data library (www.rcsb.org/pdb, PDB accession code 2TNF) and served as a template. Sequences derived from this structure with the desired substitutions in positions 71, 72, 89, and 102 were used as target sequences. The constructed models were refined with GROMOS96 (21Gunsteren W.F.V. Berndsen H.J.C. BIOMOS. Biomolecular Software. University of Groningen, Laboratory of Physical Chemistry, Groningen, Netherlands1987Google Scholar). To that end, modeled muteins were optimized by applying 200 cycles of the steepest descent method followed by 300 cycles of the conjugate gradient method. Finally stereochemical analysis of the models was achieved using WHAT IF (22Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Since hTNF and mTNF are very homologous, mTNF/hTNF in-frame chimeras may form bioactive homotrimeric molecules. Because hTNF binds to mTNF-RI only, such chimeras were used to identify the part of the mTNF protein required for binding to mTNF-RII. The interaction of wild-type (wt) and chimeric TNF proteins with both types of mTNF-R was characterized in a direct in vitro binding assay. Recombinant smTNF-Rs were covalently bound to the surface of a CM5 chip, after which a TNF solution was passed over the receptor-coated surface. The resulting sensorgrams clearly showed that mTNF interacts with both types of mTNF-R and that it dissociates much faster from mTNF-RII than from mTNF-RI. Chimeric proteins with a human sequence between amino acids 50 and 90, viz. MHTNF-22, MHTNF-23, and MHTNF-16, interact with mTNF-RI only, albeit with different efficiency. On the other hand, chimeras with a corresponding murine sequence, viz.MHTNF-11, MHTNF-24, and MHTNF-15, bind to both types of mTNF-R (Fig. 2,A, B, E, and F). We also measured the interaction of these mTNF/hTNF chimeric proteins with both types of hTNF-R/Fc proteins. As mTNF, just like hTNF, interacted with both types of hTNF-R, the chimeric TNF proteins tested also interacted with both hTNF-R/Fc proteins and could not be used to delineate TNF regions important for interaction with a specific hTNF-R (Fig. 2,G and H). In a next step, a series of mTNF muteins was constructed in which one or more of the 10 amino acids, differing between mTNF and hTNF in the region 50–90 (Fig. 1), had been replaced. The receptor interaction of the resulting muteins was analyzed in vitro. mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H and mTNF-E89T still interacted with both types of mTNF-R. Mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T, which combines both substitutions, did, however, no longer bind to mTNF-RII. The latter mutein, whose amino acids 71–73 and 89 had been replaced, still efficiently interacted with mTNF-RI (Fig. 2, C andD). Mutein hTNF-S71D/T72Y/H73Δ/T89E, on the other hand, was able to bind not only to mTNF-RI but also to mTNF-RII (Fig. 2,E and F). The results show that amino acids 71–73 and 89 are important for the interaction of TNF with smTNF-RII. Although these muteins were constructed to study the interaction of TNF with different mTNF-Rs, we also tested whether these mutations influenced the interaction with hTNF-R. mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T and hTNF-S71D/T72Y/H73Δ/T89E interacted as efficiently as wt mTNF and hTNF, respectively, with hTNF-R/Fc proteins (Fig. 2, G andH). To test the biological effect of the mutations, the activity of the muteins in L929s cytotoxicity and CT6 proliferation assays was measured. On the basis of activity of agonistic receptor-specific antibodies, cytotoxicity to L929s cells is known to depend on mTNF-RI triggering, and proliferation of CT6 cells is known to depend on mTNF-RII triggering (23Sheehan K.C.F. Pinckard J.K. Arthur C.D. Dehner L.P. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 607-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Like hTNF, mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T did not induce CT6 proliferation. Mutein hTNF-S71D/T72Y/H73Δ/T89E, on the other hand, was biologically active on CT6 cells (Table I). In L929s assays, the bioactivity of hTNF-S71D/T72Y/H73Δ/T89E was more pronounced than hTNF; surprisingly, mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T was 100-fold less active than mTNF. As such a difference was not in agreement with receptor binding results in vitro, the trimer stability of the different TNF molecules was investigated.Table IBioactivity of TNF muteins in different murine bioassaysL929s assayCT6 assayunits/mgmTNF2.1 × 1085 × 105hTNF6.7 ± 3.1 × 107<500mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T1.8 ± 1.3 × 106<500mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T/P102Q4.7 ± 1.3 × 107<500hTNF-S71D/T72Y/H73Δ/T89E1.5 ± 0.6 × 1082.9 ± 0.9 × 105L929s cells were treated in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D with a serial dilution of different TNF solutions.

One L929s unit/ml TNF is the concentration of TNF at which 50% of the cells survive. CT6 cells were treated with TNF for 24 h and subsequently treated for 5 h with 3H-labeled thymidine (incorporated label was determined).

Open table in a new tab L929s cells were treated in the presence of 1 μg/ml actinomycin D with a serial dilution of different TNF solutions. After an 18-h incubation, surviving cells were determined by staining with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide. One L929s unit/ml TNF is the concentration of TNF at which 50% of the cells survive. CT6 cells were treated with TNF for 24 h and subsequently treated for 5 h with 3H-labeled thymidine (incorporated label was determined). One CT6 unit/ml is the concentration of TNF needed to reach 30% of maximal growth induction obtained with mTNF. As bioactive trimeric TNF molecules have been shown to dissociate into inactive monomers during incubation at low concentrations (24Aderka D. Engelmann H. Maor Y. Brakebusch C. Wallach D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), the stability of mTNF and mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T was compared.125I-Labeled proteins (0.4 nm) were incubated at 26 °C for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (+10% fetal calf serum) as such or in the presence of 4 nmunlabeled mutein, after which they were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography. After incubation, the fraction in the monomeric peak was much greater for mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T than for mTNF (Fig.3, A and B). Mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H behaved in the same way as mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T after preincubation and subsequent gel filtration (data not shown). Based on these results, it may be concluded that the faster dissociation of mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T negatively affects its bioactivity in L929s assays where subnanomolar amounts of TNF are used. Additional substitution of amino acids in the region 50–90 in mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T did not enhance the cytotoxic activity to L929s cells (data not shown). The three-dimensional structure of mTNF (20Baeyens K.J. De Bondt H.L. Raeymaekers A. Fiers W. De Ranter C.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) shows that amino acids 102–104, which differ in mTNF and hTNF, are located close to amino acids 71–73 (Fig.4). Hence mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T/P102Q was created and tested. The receptor specificity of the latter mutein and mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T was similar in direct in vitro receptor binding assays (Fig. 2). As expected, both muteins were inactive in mTNF-RII-mediated CT6 assays. In mTNF-RI-mediated L929s cytotoxicity assays, however, mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T/P102Q was 25-fold more active than mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T and had a specific activity almost comparable with that of hTNF (Table I). To determine whether this increase in cytotoxic activity was due to increased trimer stability, the TNF mutein was labeled with 125I and subsequently subjected to size-exclusion chromatography. Mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T/P102Q appeared to be much more stable than mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T and to behave as wt mTNF (Fig.3C). At present, the mechanism of toxicity observed after in vivo administration of TNF-RI-specific muteins remains unclear. In the murine model, where hTNF is a specific agonist for mTNF-RI, the LD50 dose of hTNF is about 50 times higher than that of mTNF, but it still has an antitumor activity that is comparable with that of mTNF (25Brouckaert P. Ameloot P. Cauwels A. Everaerdt B. Libert C. Takahashi N. Van Molle W. Fiers W. Circ. Shock. 1994; 43: 185-190PubMed Google Scholar). In monkeys, administration of hTNF or a TNF-RI-specific mutein of hTNF induced similar changes in important physiological parameters (blood pressure and liver or kidney functions) when measured over a relatively short time interval (26Van Zee K.J. Stackpole S.A. Montegut W.J. Rogy M.A. Calvano S.E. Hsu K.C. Chao M. Meschter C.L. Loetscher H. Stüber D. Ettlin U. Wipf B. Lesslauer W. Lowry S.F. Moldawer L.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The pharmacokinetics, however, are very different; the mutein remains in circulation for a much longer time. Hence pathophysiological studies of TNF in relationship with its action on the two different receptors are quite complex. As tools for such studies we developed receptor-specific muteins both in the human and the murine system. Based on the high homology between hTNF and mTNF and the fact that hTNF does not bind to mTNF-RII, we obtained a panel of mTNF/hTNF chimeras with different mTNF-R binding characteristics. By comparing theirin vitro receptor binding, we concluded that the TNF region between amino acids 50 and 90 is important for the interaction between TNF and mTNF-RII. It may be noted that these chimeric TNF proteins still interacted with both hTNF-Rs because mTNF (just like hTNF) interacted with both types of hTNF-R. Using muteins created by site-specific mutagenesis, it became clear that the replacement of amino acids 71–73 and 89 in mTNF with their human homologues (D71S/Y72T/Δ73H and E89T) was sufficient to eliminate the interaction of this mutein with mTNF-RII as measured in vitro. As expected, mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T was not active in mTNF-RII-mediated CT6 proliferation assays. In addition, mutein hTNF-S71D/T72Y/H73Δ/T89E, which contains corresponding murine substitutions, interacted with mTNF-RII in vitro and clearly induced proliferation of murine CT6 cells. The results indicate that these amino acids are directly involved in the binding between TNF and mTNF-RII. However, mTNF-RI-mediated cytotoxic activity to L929s cells of mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T was 100-fold lower than that of wt mTNF, although this mutein still efficiently interacted with mTNF-RIin vitro. As biologically active trimeric TNF molecules have been shown to dissociate into inactive monomers after incubation at subnanomolar concentrations (27Corti A. Fassina G. Marcucci F. Barbanti E. Cassani G. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we investigated the trimer stability of wt and mutant TNF. Size-exclusion chromatography of labeled protein indicated that mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T is more prone to dissociation than mTNF during incubation at low concentrations. This trimer instability probably influences the bioactivity in L929s cytotoxicity assays, which are very sensitive and involve an 18-h incubation. The instability, however, does not affect the assessment ofin vitro receptor binding using BIAcore as this takes only a few minutes at TNF concentrations of 200 nm. By substituting other amino acids, differing between hTNF and mTNF, and by testing the bioactivity of resulting muteins, mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T/P102Q was obtained. This mutein has in vitro receptor binding characteristics similar to those of mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T but is as stable as wt mTNF after incubation at low concentrations. Furthermore, mutein mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T/P102Q, which is inactive in CT6 proliferation assays, is 25-fold more active than mTNF-D71S/Y72T/Δ73H/E89T in L929s cytotoxicity assays. The structure of a TNF subunit folds into a β-sandwich, comprising almost entirely antiparallel β-strands, and forms a bell-shaped, rigid, trimeric molecule containing two other subunits. Although the structure of hTNF and mTNF is very similar (20Baeyens K.J. De Bondt H.L. Raeymaekers A. Fiers W. De Ranter C.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 28Eck M.J. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17595-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amino acids 71–73, 89, and 102 are all located in flexible, surface-exposed loops that differ strongly (loops 64–76, 84–91, and 99–112). Moreover, the amino acids 71–73, 89, and 102 are present near the intersubunit grooves of the TNF trimer (Fig. 4). These intersubunit grooves are the main site for interaction between TNF and TNF-R as clear from mutagenesis studies (8Van Ostade X. Tavernier J. Prangé T. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and crystallography of human lymphotoxin bound to hTNF-RI (7Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Furthermore, amino acids 32 and 86 of hTNF, which are crucial for binding to hTNF-RI, are also located near these intersubunit grooves (8Van Ostade X. Tavernier J. Prangé T. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 827-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Everaerdt B. Loetscher H. Gentz R. Brockhaus M. Lesslauer W. Tavernier J. Brouckaert P. Fiers W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26350-26357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To rationalize the effect of amino acid substitutions at positions 71–73 and 102 on the trimer stability, theoretical three-dimensional structures were constructed for two mTNF muteins using the crystal structure of mTNF as a template (Fig. 4). Substituting Asp71–Tyr73 with Ser-Thr-His did not affect the internal hydrogen bonds in the predicted model but resulted in the creation of a hydrophilic patch protruding into the aqueous environment. As both Ser and Thr may participate in the formation of hydrogen bonds, we assume increased possibilities to interact with surrounding water molecules, possibly resulting in destabilization of the loop. According to our predicted model, substitution of Pro102 with Gln leads to the formation of a hydrogen bond between Gln102 NE2 and Glu110 OE1, which may enhance the stability of the loop (Fig. 4). Since a Cys69–Cys101 bridge anchors loop 99–112 with loop 64–76, this substitution may affect the top of the molecule and hence influence the overall trimer stability. We are indebted to A. Raeymaekers and F. Duerinck for preparing purified recombinant TNF and to M. Van den Hemel for excellent technical assistance."

These conditions are characterized by the proliferation and subverted differentiation of SMC with consequent neointimal formation and possible plaque instability. Thus, much effort has been directed toward the identification and testing of interventions that inhibit SMC growth (2Schwartz S.M. deBlois D. O'Brien E.R.M. Circ.

Considerable progress has been made in the latter case with the cloning and characterization of several SMC-restricted promoters whose utility will likely be appraised in the context of SMC-specific gene targeting for vascular disease. It must be stressed, however, that although many pharmaceutical approaches have proved effective in animal models of vessel disease, their translation into clinical efficacy has been disappointing. Thus, new interventional strategies should be directed toward numerous aspects of vessel wall disease rather than targeting any one pathway or protein.

Proc. 1976; 35: 1332-1338PubMed Google Scholar) that have myriad effects on cellular growth and differentiation processes (5Nau H. Blaner W.S. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 139. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000Google Scholar). Retinoids have been used clinically for the successful management of several diseases, most notably certain cancers (6Hong W.K. Sporn M.B. Science. 1997; 278: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Given the similar events underlying the pathogenesis of neoplasia and such vascular disorders as atherosclerosis and post-injury restenosis (i.e. exuberant cell growth and subverted cellular differentiation), numerous studies have been undertaken to demonstrate the utility of retinoids in conferring a desirable SMC or vascular wall phenotype. For example, retinoids can antagonize growth factor-stimulated SMC proliferation in vitro (7Hayashi A. Suzuki T. Tajima S. J. Biochem.

In a very recent report, rexinoids were demonstrated to reduce atherosclerosis in the apolipoprotein knockout mouse (23Claudel T. Leibowitz M.D. Fiévet C. Tailleux A. Wagner B. Repa J.J. Torpier G. Lobaccaro J.-M. Paterniti J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Heyman R.A. Auwerx J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2610-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Thus, there is mounting evidence to support a possible role for retinoids and rexinoids in the treatment of vascular disease. Importantly, the mechanisms through which these agents exert their effects on SMC and the vessel wall are not known. Many retinoids bind and activate retinoid receptors, which are members of the steroid receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors (24Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar). As such, activated retinoid receptors modulate a cell's transcriptome and hence its phenotype. Cultured SMC and aortic tissue express five of the six retinoid receptors and display retinoid receptor activity, at least in vitro (8Miano J.M. Topouzis S. Majesky M.W. Olson E.N. Circulation. 1996; 93: 1886-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We recently proposed that the identification of retinoid response genes in SMC could provide new avenues of research to understand the mechanisms underlying retinoid-induced changes in SMC and vessel wall phenotype (25Miano J.M. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we performed a subtractive screen for retinoid-inducible genes in cultured SMC and reported on the cloning of a novel retinoid response gene set in vascular SMC (26Chen J. Maltby K.M. Miano J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the nucleotide and amino acid sequence, expression, and chromosomal mapping of a novel retinoid-inducible gene that appears to be a member of the serine carboxypeptidase family of proteins. Cultured rat aortic SMC (RASMC) were derived from aortas of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats by a combined explant-enzymatic digestion procedure as described previously (27Miano J.M. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7095-7103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. Human coronary artery SMC (hCASMC) were obtained from a commercial vendor and grown in SmGM-2 media (Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Experiments were performed with cultured COS-7, PAC-1 SMC, and RASMC between passages 10 and 20 or hCASMC between passages 5 and 10. Unless indicated otherwise, cells were grown on 100-mm dishes and treated with either 2×10–6 mol/liter all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) or an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for various times when they were 70–80% confluent. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was performed using a PCR-Select™ cDNA subtraction kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). We pooled two time points (12 and 72 h) of total RNA (2 μg/time point) from RASMC treated with either 2 × 10−6 mol/liter atRA (“tester” cDNA pool) or an equal volume of Me2SO (“driver” cDNA pool). Hybridizing excess driver cDNA to the tester cDNA pool resulted in a subtracted library of clones containing atRA-induced transcripts. Following transformation in TOP10FEscherichia coli, individual clones were randomly selected for differential screening using the PCR-Select™ differential screening kit (CLONTECH). Briefly, cloned inserts were PCR-amplified using nested primers as specified by the manufacturer. PCR products were then arrayed in duplicate on 48-well slot-blot nylon membranes. One membrane was hybridized to radiolabeled tester cDNA and the other to radiolabeled driver cDNA. A third membrane was used to back-hybridize cloned cDNAs in order to reduce the number of duplicates. Positively identified clones were sequenced on both strands (University of Rochester Core Nucleic Acid Laboratory) and analyzed with the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) suite of software programs (version 10.1, GCG, Madison, WI). Here, we report on the sequence and characterization of one of our novel retinoid-inducible genes. A RASMC cDNA library was screened with a 405-nt fragment of RISC to isolate longer fragments of the RISC cDNA. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using a 5′-RACE kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) with gene-specific primers. 3′-Untranslated (UTR) sequences were obtained by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (First Strand Synthesis Kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) of atRA-stimulated RASMC using oligo(dT) and RISC-specific primers. Phage clones and RACE products were sequenced on both strands (University of Rochester Core Nucleic Acid Laboratory) and analyzed with the GCG suite of software programs (version 10.1) and BLASTN at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). RISC peptide sequence comparison was performed using BlastP. Molecular weight and pI were determined using ProtParam (expasy.cbr.nrc.ca/tools/protparam.html). The PROSITE pattern, PROSITE profile, BLOCKS, ProDom, PRINTS, and Pfam data bases were scanned using MOTIF (motif.genome.ad.jp/). Signal peptide prediction was performed using SignalP V2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-2.0/). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the pileup command in GCG. Serine carboxypeptidase active site consensus motifs were obtained from PROSITE. Finally, the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man Morbid Map was consulted to determine whether human RISC was associated with a known genetic disease (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/searchmorbid.html). Analysis of the rat RISC cDNA using BLAST revealed numerous mouse expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with similarity to rat RISC. ESTs were aligned using the pileup command in the GCG Wisconsin package, with the rat cDNA as the template. A consensus sequence was determined using the pretty command with the pileup file as the input. The consensus sequence was determined from at least five overlapping ESTs when possible. A region between 600 and 900 nt was underrepresented (<4 ESTs) in the EST pool, and thus no perfect consensus was reached. Here ambiguous nucleotides were edited using rat RISC as a guide to preserve the reading frame. The ESTs used to assemble the mouse RISC cDNA are AA612086, AA726687, AI118955, AI854112, AI875629, AI957256,AW107478, AW744471, BE850553, BE852371, BF016593, BF182152, C89145, andW10703. RISC protein wasin vitro translated with the TNT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). A fragment corresponding to the full-length open reading frame of RISC was generated by RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from RASMC treated with atRA for 96 h using restriction enzyme-clamped (underlined sequence) RISC-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-GATACGTCGACCTGAGGCGGGGTTTTCATC-3′ and reverse primer, 3′-GATACGATATCTGTGATGGAGCCGAGGATGC-3′). Template cDNA was obtained by subcloning the PCR-amplified product into pBluscriptII SK+ (Stratagene). A Luciferase T7 cDNA was used as a positive control. In vitro transcription-translation was carried out with 1 μg of plasmid DNA in 50 μl of reaction mixture supplemented with 50 μCi of [35S] methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and various amounts of TNT T7 Quick Master Mix (Promega) for 90 min at 30 °C. 10 μl of the products were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and dried gels were analyzed by autoradiography. RT-PCR was performed using the ProSTAR Ultra HF RT-PCR System (Stratagene) employing a pair of RISC-specific primers (same forward primer as above, reverse primer, 5′-GATACTCTAGACTCCTGCTGAGTAACCAG-3′). The amplification product, corresponding to the open reading frame of RISC less the stop codon at nt 1376–1378, was subcloned into pEF1/V5-His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to generate RISC-His. Subcellular localization of RISC-His fusion protein was appraised by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Briefly, COS-7 cells were grown to 60–80% confluence on four-well chamber slides and transfected with RISC-His using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents. The vector without insert was also transfected in parallel as a mock control. The cells were then allowed to grow for 24 or 48 h in complete medium. After washing with cold PBS, the cells were fixed in cold methanol/acetone (1:1) mixture at −20 °C for 10 min. The slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the presence of anti-His monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:200 in PBS, washed with PBS, and finally incubated for 1 h in the presence of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) diluted 1:100 in PBS. Cells were then stained with the DNA fluorochrome, TO-PRO-3 iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to view the cell nucleus. Slides were coverslipped under aqueous mounting medium and viewed with a Fluoview FV 300 confocal microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY). Voltage settings were kept constant between RISC-His and mock-transfected cells during imaging. For each experiment, primary and secondary antibody controls were also included. Final images were captured and processed with Adobe Software. The secretory property of RISC was examined by Western blotting. COS-7 cells were grown in six-well plates to 60–80% confluence and then transfected with RISC-His using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents. 24 h after transfection, the cells were re-fed with 0.1% fetal bovine serum or serum-free medium and incubated for another 24 or 48 h. The conditioned medium and extracts prepared from transfected cell were analyzed for expressed RISC-His protein by Western blotting using an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). The proteins from the medium (non-concentrated) and cell lysates were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-His monoclonal antibody diluted 1:2000. Immunocomplexes were detected with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and visualized with SuperSignal West Pico Luminol/enhancer solution (Pierce). 10- 20 μg of total RNA from RASMC, PAC-1 SMC, hCASMC, or rat tissues was fractionated on 1.1% agarose gel in the presence of 0.66 mol/liter formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membrane, and hybridized with a 405-nt RISC cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. For human tissue Northern blotting, a human multiple tissue Northern blot was obtained fromCLONTECH and hybridized with a human RISC DNA probe, cloned from a human bacterial artificial chromosome (AC007114; obtained from Research Genetics, Inc.) by PCR. Hybridizations were carried out in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Expresshyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) containing labeled probe (∼2×106 cpm/ml) at 62–68 °C for 1–2 h or overnight, depending on the probe used. The blots were then washed under stringent conditions and exposed to Kodak XAR films for different lengths of time. Housekeeping genes used as internal controls for equal RNA loading included glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18 S rRNA, and β-actin. Selective rat tissues were used to determine RISC mRNA expression in vivo. The original 405-nt rat RISC cDNA fragment obtained from the SSH screen was cloned into pBluescript SK and then linearized with eitherBamHI (for antisense riboprobe) or XhoI (for sense riboprobe). [33P]UTP-labeled riboprobes were synthesized by in vitro transcription using MAXIscriptin vitro transcription Kit (Ambion). Both antisense and sense riboprobes were assayed and the latter used as a control for specificity of the signal. Paraffin-embedded, formaldehyde-fixed tissue sections were deparaffinized and treated with 5 μg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 6 min. Hybridization with 3×107 cpm of probe/ml of hybridization solution was performed overnight at 52 °C in a humidified chamber. Slides were washed to remove unbound probe, treated with RNase A, dehydrated with ethanol, air-dried, and dipped in emulsion (Kodak NTB2). After 1 week, slides were developed in Kodak D19 developer. Darkfield and brightfield images were taken with an Olympus digital camera and processed in Adobe Photoshop. The final composite of images was assembled in FreeHand (Macromedia, San Francisco, CA). The location of RISC in the rat genome was determined with a rat/hamster radiation hybrid (RH) panel (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) using rat-specific primers. The sequence of the forward primer was 5′-CTCTTCTTCCCGACTCTACCAT-3′; the sequence of the reverse primer was 5′-GAACTTGTGATGGAGCCGAGG-3′. All RH clones except numbers 1, 20, 35, 38, 60, 90, and 101–106 were used. PCR products were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, and a vector was obtained by scoring resolved PCR products as negative = 0, positive = 1, or ambiguous = 2. The resulting vector was submitted to the Rat RH Map Server at the Rat Genome data base (rgd.mcw.edu/RHMAPSERVER/) to obtain the chromosomal location of RISC. Previously, we reported on the cloning and expression of several retinoid response genes whose sequences matched known cDNAs (26Chen J. Maltby K.M. Miano J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). During the characterization of this gene set, we found a cDNA clone that was not found in any of the genomic data bases but showed significant homology to several serine carboxypeptidase ESTs. We refer to the clone characterized in this report as RISC forretinoid-inducible serinecarboxypeptidase. Low stringency Southern blotting of rat genomic DNA suggests that RISC is a single-copy gene (data not shown). Fig. 1 A shows the induction of a ∼2.1-kilobase RISC transcript beginning 3 h after atRA administration. RISC mRNA levels increased progressively over a 5-day time course in which fresh atRA was applied daily (Fig.1 A). A similar course of RISC mRNA induction was observed in cells treated with only one application of atRA (Fig.1 B). We have also observed increases in RISC mRNA following atRA stimulation of PAC-1 SMC and hCASMC (data not shown). To obtain additional sequence data, we screened a rat aortic SMC cDNA library with the 405-nt SSH-derived fragment and sequenced 12 independent clones. Assembly of these clones, coupled with 5′-RACE and 3′-RT-PCR, led to the deduced RISC sequences shown in Fig.2 A. The rat RISC cDNA is at least 2,046 nt in length, containing a 452-amino acid open reading frame (nt 19–1375) with a calculated molecular mass of 51.2 kDa and a predicted pI of 5.37. An in-frame stop codon upstream of a Kozak methionine residue precedes a putative signal sequence (28Stroud R.M. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 754-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) having a possible cleavage site at Ala-28 (boxed amino acids in Fig.2 A). A high homology domain that represents the substrate binding site of serine carboxypeptidases is found 45 amino acids downstream from the putative cleavage site of the signal sequence (first underlined sequence in Fig. 2 A). Three additional domains that comprise the catalytic triad of serine carboxypeptidases are found at amino acids 163–170, 365–373, and 421–437 (second throughfourth underlined sequences in Fig.2 A). Finally, several putative N-linked glycosylation sites are found in the RISC primary amino acid sequence (circled residues in Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 Bshows the amino acid sequence and spacing homology of the substrate recognition domain and catalytic triad of mammalian RISC (domains I–IV) to several evolutionarily distant serine carboxypeptidases. We have assembled several mouse RISC ESTs into a cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AF330052), which is 93% homologous to the open reading frame of rat RISC (92% amino acid sequence identity/similarity). While this report was in preparation, the human ortholog of rat RISC (named human serine carboxypeptidase precursor 1) was deposited in GenBank™ (accession no. AF282618). The rat RISC cDNA is 80.9% homologous to the open reading frame of human RISC (with 82% amino acid identity). In vitro transcription-translation of rat RISC resulted in a protein with a molecular mass close to the predicted mass of 51.2 kDa (Fig. 3). To determine the cellular localization of RISC, we performed confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of COS-7 cells transfected with a RISC-His tag fusion protein. These results, shown in Fig.4 A, reveal a perinuclear distribution of the fusion protein that extends into the cytosol. Little or no nuclear accumulation of RISC was observed (Fig.4 A). Consistent with the presence of a putative NH2-terminal signal sequence, RISC-His is secreted from transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 4 B). Although the predicted RISC-His fusion protein is ∼55 kDa, the secreted and intracellular forms of the protein migrate at a molecular mass greater than 60 kDa (Fig. 4 B). This could be due to post-translational modifications such as N-linked glycosylation (see Fig.2 A).Figure 4Expression of a rat RISC-His-tagged fusion protein in COS-7 cells. A, confocal immunofluorescence micrographs of mock-transfected (left)versus RISC-His-transfected (right) COS-7 cells. Note the perinuclear accumulation of RISC-His in the right panel. B, Western blotting results of COS-7 cells transfected transiently with RISC-His (lanes 1and 3) or mock-transfected with empty His plasmid (lanes 2 and 4). CM refers to the conditioned medium, and CL denotes cellular lysate. Note the shift in size of the immunoreactive products (as compared within vitro translated RISC in Fig. 3) due to the His residues and probable post-translational modifications (e.g. N-linked glycosylation).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the tissue distribution of RISC mRNA, we performed Northern blotting on panels of rat and human tissues. The results depicted in Fig. 5 A show that RISC mRNA is highly expressed in rat aorta, bladder, and kidney with lower levels in several other tissue types. A human poly(A)+ tissue blot (Fig. 5 B) shows a similar restricted pattern of expression with highest levels in the kidney and heart (the latter is likely due to contaminating aortic tissue). Consistent with the kidney expression data, at least 10 ESTs with homology to RISC were obtained from various kidney cDNA libraries (data not shown). These results indicate that high level RISC mRNA expression is tissue-restrictive, suggesting that it may have functions specific for cells found in aorta, bladder, and kidney. In situ hybridization studies were carried out to determine the spatial distribution of RISC mRNA in various rat tissues (Fig.6). Rat RISC mRNA is modestly elevated in the rat aorta (Fig. 6 A), which may reflect the reduced cellularity of this tissue as compared with others and/or the heterogeneity that exists between SMC lineages of the aorta (29Topouzis S. Majesky M.W. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 430-445Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). RISC expression was localized to the transitional epithelium of the bladder (Fig. 6 C). In the kidney, RISC showed expression throughout the renal cortex with little or no hybridization signal in the renal medulla (Fig. 6 E). Careful examination of the cortical expression of RISC revealed that the transcript was confined largely to the epithelium o"
https://openalex.org/W2137926473,"Previously we demonstrated in a cell-free ovarian follicular plasma membrane model that agonist-dependent desensitization of the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LH/CG R) is GTP-dependent, mimicked by the addition of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) nucleotide binding site opener, which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ARFs 1 and 6, and selectively inhibited by synthetic N-terminal ARF6 peptides. We therefore sought direct evidence that activation of the LH/CG R promotes activation of ARF1 and/or ARF6. Using a classic ARF activation assay, the cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαs, results show that LH/CG R activation stimulates an ARF protein by a brefeldin A-independent mechanism. Synthetic N-terminal inhibitory ARF6 but not ARF1 peptide blocks LH/CG R-stimulated ARF activity. LH/CG R activation also promotes the binding of a photoaffinity GTP analog to a protein that migrates on one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with ARF6. These results suggest that ARF6 is the predominant ARF activated by the LH/CG R. To activate ARF6, the LH/CG R does not appear to signal through the C-terminal regions of Gαi or Gαq or through the second or third intracellular loops or the N terminus of the cytoplasmic tail of the LH/CG R. Although exogenous recombinant ARNO promotes only a small increase in ARF6 activation in the presence of activated LH/CG R, hCG-stimulated ARF6 activation is reduced to basal levels by catalytically inactive ARF nucleotide binding-site opener. These results provide direct evidence that LH/CG R activation leads to the activation of membrane-delimited ARF6.

The pool of membrane-delimited βarrestin1 is made available to the activated LH/CG receptor by one or more steps that occur in response to LH/CG receptor activation and are dependent upon GTP (3Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to elucidate the basis for the GTP dependence of βarrestin1-dependent LH/CG receptor desensitization. To this end, we have shown that LH/CG receptor desensitization appears to be independent of heterotrimeric Gs, Gi, and Gq proteins, and of the Ras, Rap, and Rac families of small G proteins, based on the inability of C-terminal peptides or antisera directed toward the C termini of the Gα proteins, sequestration of Gβγ (4Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M.

A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to disrupt LH/CG receptor desensitization. Rather, LH/CG receptor desensitization appears to be dependent on activation of the small G protein ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) (3Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5901-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on results showing that both βarrestin1 release from its membrane docking site and subsequent LH/CG receptor desensitization are inhibited by preincubation of membranes with the inhibitory N-terminal ARF6 peptide but not with the analogous ARF1 peptide. As all G protein activation is dependent on a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), we sought to identify a GEF that might be involved in βarrestin1-dependent LH/CG receptor desensitization. LH/CG receptor desensitization is insensitive to brefeldin A (3Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K.

Moreover, βarrestin1 release from its membrane docking site and LH/CG receptor desensitization are stimulated by the addition of recombinant ARNO, a GEF for ARFs 1 and 6 (3Mukherjee S. Gurevich V.V. Jones J.C.R. Casanova J.E. Frank S.R. Maizels E.T. Bader M.-F. Kahn R.A. Palczewski K. Aktories K. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 6524–6528.Google Scholar). These results suggest that endogenous ARNO, or an ARNO-like GEF, activates ARF1 and/or ARF6 to promote βarrestin1 release and consequent LH/CG receptor desensitization. It was therefore important to ascertain directly whether LH/CG receptor activation indeed promotes activation of an ARF and if the activated ARF corresponds to ARF1 and/or ARF6. The classic method used to demonstrate ARF activation is the ability of cholera toxin (CTX) to catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of Gs(8Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARF functions in the reaction as a cofactor by lowering theKm for both the ADP-ribose donor NAD and Gαs (9Noda M. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1034: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), stimulating the reaction 50-fold (10Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29490-29494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that preincubation of ovarian follicular membranes with hCG but not with BSA promotes CTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of especially the long form but also the short form of Gαs, both of which are immunoprecipitated with anti-Gαsantisera (11Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M. Rasenick M.M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 538-549PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M. Lamm M.L. Mukherjee S. Rasenick M.M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4547-4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαswas dependent on the concentration of hCG and increased with time of incubation in the presence but not in the absence of hCG (11Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M. Rasenick M.M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 538-549PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that LH/CG receptor activation promotes activation of an ARF in follicular membranes. In the following studies we therefore sought to determine directly whether the agonist-activated LH/CG receptor promotes activation of ARF1 and/or ARF6 in follicular membranes. Using three different ARF activation assays, results show that ARF6 is the predominant ARF activated by the LH/CG receptor. Purified hCG (CR-127) and FSH (oFSH-19) were kindly provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow of the National Hormone and Pituitary Program Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (Torrance, CA). Purified deglycosylated (dg) hCG was kindly provided by Dr. Patrick Roche, Mayo Clinic, Rochester MN. The ovarian follicular membrane fraction, which was purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation and enriched in AC activity, was prepared as previously described and stored at −70 °C (13Ekstrom R.C. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Activation of CTX was done as previously described (11Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M. Rasenick M.M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 538-549PubMed Google Scholar). For the ARF activation assay, membranes (100 μg of protein) were preincubated with indicated additions at 4 °C for 30 or 60 min and then incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, unless otherwise indicated, in a final volume of 100 μl containing 1 mm ATP, 15 mm thymidine, 5 mm ADP-ribose, 20 mml-arginine-HCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 μm[32P]NAD (1 Ci/mmol), 50 μg/ml activated CTX, and 10 μg/ml BSA or hCG (11Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M. Rasenick M.M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 538-549PubMed Google Scholar). GTP was not added unless so specified. Membranes were then washed by adding 1 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA, pelleted, and resuspended in SDS-STOP (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.75, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA) (12Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and then gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). The incorporation of 32P into Gαs was quantitated from scanned autoradiograms with the Molecular Analyst/PC Image Analysis software program. Alternatively, membranes (∼30 μg of membrane protein) were preincubated 30 min at 4 °C with or without indicated peptides, then subjected to a 5-min AC assay, as detailed in legend to Fig. 4. The reaction was then stopped and [32P]cAMP was purified as previously described (15Bockaert J. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol.

The pH gradient of the tube gel was determined by placing gel slices in 0.5 ml of H20 overnight and then measuring the pH. Crude pellet and supernatant fractions of porcine ovarian follicles were obtained by homogenizing tissue in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 1.0 mm EDTA, with a glass-glass Dounce homogenizer (∼10 strokes), followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min and then at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The final pellet was resuspended in the volume of the original homogenate. SDS-STOP was then added to both the final pellet and supernatant fractions, and the samples were boiled for 10 min and stored at −70 °C. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were as previously described (11Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M. Rasenick M.M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 538-549PubMed Google Scholar, 12Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M.

Anti-caveolin was obtained from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. The following antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA): anti-Gαi (C-10), C-terminal peptide antibody to Gαi3, which reacts with all Gαi proteins; anti-Gαq/11 (C-19), C-terminal peptide antibody specific for Gαq and Gα11; anti-Gαs/olf (C-18), C-terminal peptide antibody to Gαs. Preparation and specificity of anti-ARF antibodies was as previously described (19Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol.

LH/CG receptor antibody was made in male rabbits by the Fazleabas laboratory against a synthetic peptide, conjugated to keyhole lymphocyte hemagglutinin, corresponding to amino acids 257–271 of the extracellular domain of the human LH/CG receptor. This antibody reacts on SDS-PAGE (1:5000 dilution) with a band in porcine ovarian follicular membranes at ∼88 kDa corresponding to the LH/CG receptor and with an unidentified second band of ∼55 kDa. All other chemicals and synthetic peptides were obtained from sources previously described (1Mukherjee S. Palczewski K. Gurevich V.V. Hunzicker-Dunn M. J. Biol.

Final concentrations are indicated for all reactions. We first sought to determine which ARFs are present in our plasma membrane model. We have concentrated on ARFs 1 and 6, based on our evidence that both βarrestin1 release from its membrane docking site and LH/CG receptor desensitization are activated by ARNO, which activates ARFs 1 and 6 (21Caumont A.-S.

Both ARFs 1 and 6 are generally believed to be localized in an inactive, GDP-bound state in a cytosolic fraction or (for ARF6) in a subpopulation of endosomes and to translocate to Golgi membranes for ARF1 or to the plasma membrane for ARF6 upon binding GTP (5Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, there are also reports that ARF1, like ARF6, can be recruited to the plasma membrane (25Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr.

We first determined if immunoreactive ARFs 1 and 6 are detectable in purified porcine follicular membranes. Results (Fig.1 A, lane 1) show that the pan-ARF antibody 1D9, which reacts well with all ARFs but less so with ARF4 (19Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), detects a single band of ∼21 kDa in purified porcine follicular membranes. Use of specific ARF6 and ARF1 antisera (19Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) shows that this 1D9-reactive band contains both ARFs 6 and 1 (Fig.1 A, lanes 2 and 3). ARFs 2–5 can also be detected in these purified membranes of ∼21 kDa, using specific antisera (19Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol.

Because these results do not allow conclusions regarding which of the ARFs predominate in purified follicular membranes, we performed 2D-PAGE (with pH 3–10 ampholines) of the purified membrane fraction and probed the resulting blot with both the pan-ARF antibody 1D9- and ARF1-specific antibody. The ARF1-specific antibody detects a single dot of ∼21 kDa with a pI of ∼7.1 (not shown). Results with 1D9 (Fig. 1 B) indicate the presence not only of ARF6 with a pI of ∼8.0 and ARF1 with a pI of ∼7.1 (28Yang C.Z. Heimberg H. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mueckler M.M. Stahl P.D. J. Biol.

Chang P.P. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 268: 8213-8219Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 32Huber L.A. Ullrich O. Takai Y. Lutcke A. Dupree P. Olkkonen V. Virta H. deHoop M.J. Alenandrov K. Peter M. Zerial M. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7874-7878Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Quantitation of the amount of ARF6 in this membrane fraction by Western blotting with the ARF6-specific antibody, using the signal generated by recombinant ARF6 as the standard, yielded a concentration of ∼8 μg of ARF6 protein/mg of membrane protein (Fig. 1 C). The abundance of ARF6 in this ovarian tissue is consistent with the earlier report of very high ARF6 expression in the human ovary (19Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 1 D show that ARF6 is detectable, using the ARF6-specific antibody, in the 10,000 ×g pellet and not in the supernatant fractions of porcine ovarian follicles in equivalent levels throughout antral follicular development. Taken together, these results show that, although ARFs 1 and 6 as well as other ARFs are detected in the membrane fraction, ARF6 is a relatively abundant protein and is present through antral follicular development. We next sought to determine which plasma membrane-localized ARF(s) is activated as a consequence of LH/CG receptor activation. One technique to assess the activation of any G protein is its agonist-dependent binding of GTP. Release of GDP from G proteins is rate-limiting and stimulated by GEFs like the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for heterotrimeric G proteins or specific GEFs for the many small G proteins (33Spiegel A.M. Shenker A. Weinstein L.S. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 536-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 34Nuoffer C. Balch W.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 949-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Hormone-dependent binding of GTP or its photoaffinity analog [32P]AAGTP provides a method to detect G protein activation. Initial experiments showed that hCG stimulates binding of the photoaffinity GTP analog [32P]AAGTP to one or more proteins of ∼21 kDa in porcine follicular membranes (Fig.2 A). However, because the porcine follicular membrane fraction likely contains many small G proteins such as Ras (11Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M. Rasenick M.M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 538-549PubMed Google Scholar) and the ARFs, we first sought to obtain a membrane fraction enriched in ARF6 to ascertain whether hCG promotes activation of ARF6. We determined that upon extraction of membrane proteins with 1% Triton X-100, ARF6 as well as the Triton-insoluble marker protein caveolin (35Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) remain in the Triton-insoluble fraction whereas Gαs (12Rajagopalan-Gupta R.M. Lamm M.L. Mukherjee S. Rasenick M.M. Hunzicker-Dunn M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4547-4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the LH/CG receptor are localized to a Triton-soluble fraction (Fig. 2 B). Neither ARF1 (Fig.2 C) nor ARFs 3, 4, or 5 (not shown) is detectable in the Triton-insoluble fraction. Consistent with this result, 2D-PAGE (with 70% pH 8–10, 30% pH 3–10 ampholines) of the Triton-insoluble fraction followed by Western blotting with pan-ARF antibody 1D9 (Fig.2 D) reveals that the immunoreactive ARF proteins in this fraction are basic, with pI values of ∼8.0 consistent with the pI of ARF6 (28Yang C.Z.

The more acidic ARFs 2–5 (31Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Tsuchiya M. Chang P.P. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 268: 8213-8219Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), which should migrate to the acidic end of the isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel (marked by the “∨”), were not detected. These results indicate that, among the ARFs, only ARF6 segregates into the Triton-insoluble membrane fraction. We next determined whether hCG promotes binding of the photoaffinity GTP analog [32P]AAGTP to ARF6. Follicular membranes were incubated for 10 min with [32P]AAGTP in the presence of BSA or hCG, UV-irradiated to covalently bind the GTP analog to protein, then extracted with 1% Triton X-100. Results (Fig. 2 E) show that hCG increased binding of [32P]AAGTP to a protein retained in the Triton-insoluble membrane fraction ∼21 kDa, which corresponds to the molecular weight of ARF6. We next sought to determine whether the 21-kDa protein, which binds [32P]AAGTP in thetotal membrane fractions, corresponds to ARF6. 2D-PAGE of the total membrane fraction incubated with hCG and [32P]AAGTP shows that only a single protein of ∼21 kDa with a pI of ∼8.0 covalently binds [32P]AAGTP (Fig.2 F, upper panel) and that this protein comigrates with immunoreactive ARF6 (lower panel). No labeling of the more acidic ARFs, which should migrate toward the acidic end of the IEF gel (marked by the “v”), was detected. These results therefore suggest that ARF6 is indeed activated to bind [32P]AAGTP in response to LH/CG receptor activation. The ability of a receptor agonist to stimulate CTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gα proteins has been used as evidence that an agonist-activated receptor signals to one or more G proteins (36Milligan G.

To understand the molecular basis for this specificity, we have examined the synaptotagmin 1 C2A domain, which interacts in a primarily electrostatic, Ca2+-dependent reaction with negatively charged phospholipids, and the cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) C2 domain, which interacts by a primarily hydrophobic Ca2+-dependent mechanism with neutral phospholipids. We show that grafting the short Ca2+-binding loops from the tip of the cPLA2C2 domain onto the top of the synaptotagmin 1 C2A domain confers onto the synaptotagmin 1 C2A domain the phospholipid binding specificity of the cPLA2C2 domain, indicating that the functional specificity of C2 domains is determined by their short top loops.

Most C2domains bind Ca2+ and interact with phospholipid membranes upon Ca2+ binding. The three-dimensional structures of several C2 domains have been elucidated at atomic resolution (5Sutton R.B.

These structures revealed that C2domains, despite a low overall sequence identity, are composed of similar β-sandwiches with flexible loops at the top and the bottom. However, the β-strands in the β-sandwiches exhibit two distinct topologies, resulting in type 1 (e.g. the C2A domain of synaptotagmin 1) and type 2 C2 domains (e.g. the C2 domain of cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2)1 (5Sutton R.B.

The two topologies are circular permutations of each other, such that the first β-strand in type 1 C2 domains is the eighth β-strand of type 2 C2 domains, and the eighth β-strand of type 1 C2 domains corresponds to the seventh β-strand of type 2 C2 domains as illustrated in the sequence alignment in Fig. 1A. In C2 domains, Ca2+ binds exclusively to the top loops, which coordinate 2–3 Ca2+ ions primarily via multidentate aspartate residues (7Ubach J. Garcı́a J. Nittler M.P. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat.

The Ca2+-binding sites are similar among C2 domains with relatively low but variable intrinsic binding affinities (7Ubach J. Garcı́a J. Nittler M.P. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat.

The best characterized function of C2 domains consists of their Ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipid membranes, although not all C2 domains appear to share this function. Phospholipid binding mediates the Ca2+-stimulated recruitment of C2 domain proteins to membranes upon stimulation (1Williams R.L. Katan M.

Phospholipids dramatically increase the overall Ca2+ affinity of C2 domains, most likely because the phospholipid head groups provide additional coordination sites for Ca2+ ions at the tip of the C2domains (15Mosior M. Epand R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13798-13805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhang X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C.

EMBO J. 2000; 18: 6329-6338Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar).At least two different phospholipid-binding modes have been observed in C2 domains, as best described for the C2A domain of synaptotagmin 1 and the C2 domain of cPLA2 (Table I). In both C2 domains, the top loops bind the Ca2+ ions, but the architecture and stoichiometry of the Ca2+-binding site differ (Fig. 1A; Refs. 13Ubach J. Zhang X. Shao X. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3921-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar and 14Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The most important difference between the two C2 domains, however, lies in their binding specificity. The synaptotagmin C2A domain binds to negatively charged phospholipids in a primarily electrostatic interaction (17Zhang X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12395-12403Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 22Davletov B. Perisic O. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19093-19096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cPLA2 C2domain interacts with neutral phospholipids in a hydrophobic reaction (Table I; Refs. 16Nalefski E.A. Slazas M.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12011-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Davletov B. Perisic O. Williams R.L. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 6637-6642Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Since Ca2+ and phospholipids bind to the top loops of C2 domains, it is plausible to hypothesize that the top loops may be instrumental in determining their respective properties, but this has never been demonstrated. The top loops are relatively short, the cPLA2and synaptotagmin C2 domains exhibit a low overall sequence similarity and contain different β-strand topologies (Fig. 1), suggesting that the loops may not be sufficient in specifying the properties of a C2 domain. To address this question, we have now tested if replacing the top loops of the synaptotagmin 1 C2A domain with those of the cPLA2C2 domain will “reprogram” the phospholipid-binding mode of the synaptotagmin C2A domain.Table IComparison of the properties of the C2A domain of synaptotagmin 1 and the C2 domain of cytosolic phospholipase A2PropertyC2A domain of synaptotagmin 1C2domain of phospholipase A2Refs.Type of C2domainType 1Type 25Sutton R.B.

The five C2 domain proteins expressed well in bacteria and were isolated in an electrophoretically pure form on glutathione-agarose (data not shown). Using these proteins, we first tested if the loop-swap C2A domains were still capable of Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding.As described previously (17Zhang X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C.

All binding was Ca2+-dependent. The chimeric loop-swap C2A domains that contained either only loops 1 and 2 or loop 3 exhibited no Ca2+-dependent binding of 100% PC liposomes and little binding to liposomes composed of 30% PS/70% PC. Very high Ca2+ concentrations were tested in these experiments (10 mm) to exclude the possibility that these partial loop swaps may simply have a very low Ca2+affinity. By contrast, the complete loop-swap C2 domain bound to phospholipids as a function of Ca2+ and thus was functional (Fig. 2). Strikingly, although the loop-swap C2A domain contains only the top loops of the cPLA2C2 domain and is otherwise identical with the synaptotagmin C2A domain, it exhibited similar binding to neutral phospholipids (PC and PE) as the cPLA2 C2domain (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Quantitations revealed that the loop-swap C2A domain bound as much neutral liposomes as the cPLA2 C2 domain, but was less capable of binding negatively charged liposomes than the cPLA2C2 domain (data not shown).Figure 2Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding by GST fusion proteins of the synaptotagmin 1 C2A domain, the cPLA2 C2 domain, and the three different chimeric synaptotagmin/cPLA2 loop swap C2A domains. Immobilized GST fusion proteins were used to measure binding of radiolabeled liposomes composed of 100% PC (top) or 30% PS/70% PC (bottom) in 0.15m NaCl as a function of increasing concentrations of Ca2+ as indicated. Data shown are means ± S.E. from a representative experiment performed in triplicate and independently repeated multiple times. Note that only the complete loop-swap restores Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding activity with the specificity of the cPLA2 C2 domain, not the synaptotagmin C2A domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next examined Ca2+-dependent binding of the cPLA2 C2 domain, the synaptotagmin C2A domain, and the complete loop-swap C2domain to PC and PS liposomes in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl to test whether phospholipid binding is primarily electrostatic or hydrophobic (Fig.3). The rationale of this experiment is that high NaCl should stabilize hydrophobic interactions but disrupt electrostatic interactions. In agreement with previous studies (18Fernández-Chacón R. Königstorfer A. Gerber S.H. Garcı́a J. Matos M.F. Stevens C.F. Brose N. Rizo J. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar,22Davletov B. Perisic O.

In contrast, the primarily electrostatic binding of the synaptotagmin C2A domain to phospholipids was highly salt-sensitive and was abolished by 0.6 m NaCl. In the same experiments, the loop-swap C2A domain behaved like the cPLA2C2 domain, with phospholipid binding resistant to interference by NaCl at concentrations of up to 1.0 m (Fig.3).Figure 3Specificity and salt sensitivity of phospholipid binding to C2 domains. Immobilized GST fusion proteins of the cPLA2 C2 domain, the complete loop-swap C2 domain, and the synaptotagmin 1 C2A domain were used to measure binding of radiolabeled liposomes composed of 100% PC (top) or 30% PS/70% PC (bottom) as a function of 1 mm Ca2+. Binding reactions were carried out with increasing concentrations of NaCl in the binding buffer as indicated to differentiate between primarily electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Data shown are means ± S.E. from a representative experiment performed in triplicates and independently repeated multiple times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The functionality of the loop-swap C2A domain composed of the synaptotagmin C2A domain with only short Ca2+-binding loops from the cPLA2C2 domain is surprising considering the fact that the cPLA2 and synaptotagmin C2 domains have divergent properties and distinct β-strand topologies. Studies with different divalent cations showed that in all three C2domains, Mg2+ was unable to stimulate phospholipid binding at high concentrations, whereas Ba2+ and Sr2+at least partly substituted for Ca2+, albeit with lower affinity (data not shown). The cPLA2 C2 domain and the loop-swap C2 domain were also similar with respect to divalent cation binding in that Ba2+ and Sr2+ were slightly more effective in replacing Ca2+ in these C2 domains than in the synaptotagmin C2A domain (data not shown). To test more accurately if the precise conformation of the β-strand sandwich contributes to the Ca2+ binding properties of the overall C2 domains, we examined their apparent Ca2+affinities in the presence of phospholipid membranes. Ca2+/EGTA buffers were used in these experiments to measure the Ca2+ dependence of phospholipid binding to the various immobilized C2 domains. Since Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding by the synaptotagmin C2A domain is primarily electrostatic, the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the synaptotagmin C2A domain depends on the phospholipid composition of the liposomes used for such measurements (18Fernández-Chacón R.

Therefore we measured the apparent Ca2+ affinity of all three C2 domains with four types of liposomes containing an increasing abundance of negatively charged phospholipids (Table II).Table IIApparent Ca2+-binding affinities of C2 domainsLiposome phospholipidscPLA2EC50nLoop-swap1.2.3 EC50nSynaptotagmin 1 EC50nµmµmµm100.0% PC8.6 ± 0.7448.3 ± 1.33No binding22.5% PS/77.5% PC4.2 ± 0.13115.3 ± 27.1321.0 ± 1.4330.0% PS/70.0% PC6.2 ± 1.74180.8 ± 26.0414.7 ± 0.9345.0% PS/55.0% PC5.1 ± 0.22256.5 ± 28.528.9 ± 0.63Apparent Ca2+ binding affinities of the C2 domain from cPLA2, the complete loop-swap C2 domain, and the synaptotagmin 1 C2 domain were determined using Ca2+titrations of phospholipid binding with Ca2+/EGTA buffers (Fig.4).

The complete loop-swap C2A domain displayed a significantly lower Ca2+ affinity (5–15-fold depending on phospholipid composition) than either the cPLA2 C2 domain or the synaptotagmin C2A domain (Fig. 4 and Table II). As predicted, the Ca2+ affinity of the synaptotagmin C2A domain was dependent on phospholipid composition, and two to three times higher in 45% PS/55% PC than in 22.5% PS/77.5% PC. By contrast, the cPLA2 C2 domain exhibited similar affinities in the presence of liposomes independent of the surface charge (Table II). Unexpectedly, the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the loop-swap C2 domain was dependent on the phospholipid composition with the opposite relationship as the synaptotagmin C2A domain. This affinity decreased almost 5-fold with increasingly negatively charged liposomes (Table II). Together these data suggest that the precise conformation of the underlying β-sandwich has little influence on the phospholipid binding specificity or on the hydrophobicversus electrostatic binding mechanism mediated by the top Ca2+-binding loops, but has a marked effect on the overall Ca2+ affinity of the C2 domain (TableII).Figure 4Ca2+ concentration dependence of phospholipid binding to the C2 domain of cPLA2 , the complete loop-swap C2 domain (Loop-Swap), and the C2A domain of synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) measured with liposomes composed of 100% PC (top) or 30% PS/70% PC (bottom). Binding reactions were carried out with immobilized GST fusion proteins in Ca2+/EGTA buffers to clamp the free Ca2+ concentration. Data shown are means ± S.E. from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. Mean values obtained from multiple independent experiments with liposomes composed of 100% PC, 22.5% PS/77.5% PC, 30% PS/70% PC, and 45% PS/55% PC are summarized in Table II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)SummaryThe C2A domain of synaptotagmin 1 and the C2 domain of cPLA2 are composed of β-sandwiches that contain flexible Ca2+-binding loops on top, which were previously hypothesized to contribute to the Ca2+-dependent interactions of these domains with phospholipid membranes. However, the two C2 domains have different β-strand topologies and bind phospholipids with distinct Ca2+-dependent mechanisms and specificities, suggesting that the top loops may not be sufficient for the specific properties of the various C2 domains. To test this directly, we have now grafted the top loops of the cPLA2 C2 domain onto the tip of the synaptotagmin C2A domain. We find that grafting all of the Ca2+-binding loops of the cPLA2 C2domain enables the synaptotagmin C2A domain to bind to neutral phospholipids in a salt-insensitive reaction similar to the cPLA2 C2 domain, whereas grafting only one or two of the three loops is insufficient. Furthermore, the loop-swap C2 domain exhibited a lower Ca2+ affinity, indicative of a contribution of the backbone of the C2domain β-sandwich to the precise positioning of the Ca2+-binding loops. These data demonstrate that the functional features and phospholipid binding modes of the cPLA2 and synaptotagmin C2 domains are largely determined by their top loops, a surprising result considering the shortness of these sequences in the various C2 domains. C2 domains are widely distributed, independently folding domains that are present in many signal transduction and membrane trafficking proteins, such as phospholipases, protein kinase C, and synaptotagmins (reviewed in Refs. 1Williams R.L.

Most C2domains bind Ca2+ and interact with phospholipid membranes upon Ca2+ binding. The three-dimensional structures of several C2 domains have been elucidated at atomic resolution (5Sutton R.B.

These structures revealed that C2domains, despite a low overall sequence identity, are composed of similar β-sandwiches with flexible loops at the top and the bottom. However, the β-strands in the β-sandwiches exhibit two distinct topologies, resulting in type 1 (e.g. the C2A domain of synaptotagmin 1) and type 2 C2 domains (e.g. the C2 domain of cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2)1 (5Sutton R.B.

The two topologies are circular permutations of each other, such that the first β-strand in type 1 C2 domains is the eighth β-strand of type 2 C2 domains, and the eighth β-strand of type 1 C2 domains corresponds to the seventh β-strand of type 2 C2 domains as illustrated in the sequence alignment in Fig. 1A. In C2 domains, Ca2+ binds exclusively to the top loops, which coordinate 2–3 Ca2+ ions primarily via multidentate aspartate residues (7Ubach J. Garcı́a J. Nittler M.P. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Nat.

Upon interaction of C3 with IgG·IC, C3b·C3b·IgG covalent complexes are formed that are detected on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by two bands corresponding to C3b·C3b (band A) and C3b·IgG (band B) covalent complexes. This allows one to evaluate the covalent binding of C3b to IgG antibodies. It has been described that C3b can attach to both the Fab (on the CH1 domain) and the Fc regions of IgG. Here the covalent interaction of C3b to the CH1 domain, a region previously described spanning residues 125–147, has been studied. This region of the CH1 domain is exposed to solvent and contains a cluster of six potential acceptor sites for ester bond formation with C3b (four Ser and two Thr). A set of 10 mutant Abs were generated with the putative acceptor residues substituted by Ala, and we studied their covalent interaction with C3b. Single (Ser-131, Ser-132, Ser-134, Thr-135, Ser-136, and Thr-139), double (positions 131–132), and multiple (positions 134–135-136, 131–132-134–135-136, and 131–132-134–135-136–139) mutants were produced. None of the mutants (single, double, or multiple) abolished completely the ability of IgG to bind C3b, indicating the presence of C3b binding regions other than in the CH1 domain. However, all mutant Abs, in which serine at position 132 was replaced by Ala, showed a significant decrease in the ability to form C3b·IgG covalent complexes, whereas the remaining mutants had normal activity. In addition we examined ICs using the F(ab′)2 fragment of the mutant Abs, and only those containing Ala at position 132 (instead of Ser) failed to bind C3b. Thus Ser-132 is the binding site for C3b on the CH1 domain of the heavy chain, in the Fab region of human IgG.

In this process the covalent incorporation of C3b into the IC lattice is the critical event that conditions the fate of the IC·C3b (2Carroll M. Adv.

In this macromolecular structure C3b molecules are covalently bound to each other and to the IgG, preferentially through ester bonds (4Vivanco F. Pastor C. Vidarte L. De los Rios V. Mas S. Res. Ad.

These C3b·C3b dimers are subsequently converted into iC3b·iC3b·IgG complexes by the complement regulators (5Barrio E. Antón L.C. Marqués G. Sánchez A. Vivanco F. Eur. J.

The size of the two proteins involved (150 kDa and about 180 kDa for IgG and C3b, respectively) and the lability of the ester linkage have made it difficult to identify the amino acids involved. Exact knowledge of the site(s) of attachment has become more important with the development of genetically engineered antibodies and chimeras with therapeutic applications (9Hudson P.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Two main areas for C3b binding have been described on the IgG, one located in the CH1 domain of Fab (10Shohet J. Bergamaschini L. Davis A.E. Carroll M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18520-18524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shohet J. Pemberton P. Carroll M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5866-5871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the other in the Fc region (8Antón L.C. Ruiz S. Barrio E. Marqués G. Sánchez A. Vivanco F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The binding site on the CH1 domain comprises the first loop and part of the adjacent β strands (residues 125–147; Eu numbering) (33Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foelter C. Proteins of Immunological Interest. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar). This region is exposed to solvent and contains eight possible acceptor residues (four Ser, two Thr, and two Lys). Lys residues are not exposed to solvent and not expected to be potential sites for amide bond formation with C3. Using synthetic peptides corresponding to this region of IgG1, Sahu and Pangburn (12Sahu A. Pangburn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28997-29002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that Thr-135 would be the preferred site for C3b binding. A more direct approach to identifying the site(s) of C3b attachment is by site-directed mutagenesis of this region of IgG. Thus, in this work we have generated a set of chimeric mutant antibodies in which one or more hydroxylated amino acid residues were substituted by Ala. We studied their covalent interaction with C3b. Data indicate that Ser-132 is the acceptor residue for the covalent binding of C3b on the CH1 domain of human IgG1. A chimeric antibody was constructed with murine V regions (VH and VL) of a monoclonal antibody specific for human serum albumin (HSA) (HSA-4; clone LGF1/4.3.1.B9) and human constant regions (Cγ1 and Cκ) as previously described (7Muñoz E.

Immunol. 1998; 28: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mutant antibody genes were initially constructed in pBlueScript II SK (Stratagene), and this vector was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using polymerase chain reaction (ExSite kit, Stratagene). Mutations were generated by changing hydroxylated residues by Ala. The complete H and L genes were sequenced for every Ab confirming the presence of the mutations. The non-Ab-producing myeloma cell line Sp2/0 was used for expression of the complete Abs using the pING2003E vector as described (7Muñoz E. Vidarte L. Casado M.T. Pastor C. Vivanco F. Int.

They were precipitated from ascites by ammonium sulfate and purified on protein-A Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IgG was eluted with citrate buffer, pH 3.5, neutralized, and loaded onto an HSA-Sepharose column, which separates the chimeric antibodies (HSA-specific) from mouse host IgGs (7Muñoz E. Vidarte L.

Purity of antibodies and F(ab′)2 fragments was verified by SDS-PAGE under reduced and non-reduced conditions and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 (Sigma). Ag·Ab binding interactions were monitored by surface plasmon resonance on an IAsys instrument (Fissons Applied Sensor Technology). HSA was immobilized into the cuvette precoated with a high molecular weight carboxymethylated dextran according to the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. For determination of Kd values, binding was examined using four to six different antibody concentrations in the 50–200 nm range in phosphate-buffered saline (0.02 mNa3PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2). Kinetic analysis was performed using the FASTfit software provided by the manufacturer, which yielded the values forKon and Kdiss at each antibody concentration. An ε (0.1%, 1 cm, 280 nm) of 1.3 was used for all the antibodies. SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out as previously described (5Barrio E. Antón L.C. Marqués G.

A peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-human Fcγ; Nordic, The Netherlands) with the ECL system was used. In some cases, the same membrane was sequentially (after striping) used with both antisera to show the presence of C3 and the Ab in the same band. HSA-antibody aggregates were formed at equivalence as described previously in detail (7Muñoz E. Vidarte L. Casado M.T. Pastor C. Vivanco F. Int.

After the incubation period, the reaction was stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the precipitates were washed three times with the same buffer and resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. To detect the binding of C3b to the aggregates, 6.25 μg of iodo[1-14C]acetamide (2.22 Gbq/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were included in the normal human serum. This labeled the covalent complexes in which C3b (which is radioalkylated in the nascent SH group) was been incorporated (5Barrio E. Antón L.C. Marqués G. Sánchez A. Vivanco F. Eur. J.

For comparison, ICs formed with the chimeric antibody (chAb) and with the scAb were included as positive and negative controls, respectively, in each set of assays. ICs incubated with normal human serum-EDTA, which prevents the classical as well as the alternative pathways of complement, were included as the control. Band B corresponds to C3α65-H covalent adducts that can be used as a measure of the capacity of the Ab to covalently bind C3 (5Barrio E. Antón L.C. Marqués G. Sánchez A. Vivanco F. Eur. J.

Hence, the C3b covalent binding ability of the different mutant Abs was evaluated, quantitating band B in the autoradiographies or Western blots, using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer (Image Quant 3.1 software) and normalized to the sum of the intensity of bands B and H (the total amount of H chain). For each chimeric or mutant Ab, a minimum of three independent binding assays was performed, and the average value and S.D. was determined. To study the possible effects that the mutations could produce on the conformation of the loop (positions 128–142), we modeled this region for the mutant Abs using as a reference three-dimensional structures of antibodies of the same isotype (γ,κ) that had been resolved at less than 2.9 Å, taken from the Protein Data Bank (Brookhaven) (20Hex M.

The alignment of sequences and changes in amino acid side chains were carried out using the Swiss-Pdb Viewer program. Data were submitted to the automated protein-modeling server (Swiss model; GlaxoSmithKline, Geneva; www.expasy.ch) for minimum energy calculations (Gromos program) (23Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

The method used to purify Abs prevents the presence of Ab molecules from the host, interfering with the C3 binding assays and masking the results. All the Abs exhibited Ka constants ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 × 10−7m (Fig.1; chimeric Ab, 1.26 × 10−7m), indicating that the mutations introduced in the CH1 domain do not affect the interaction with the Ag. Furthermore, the precipitin curves were virtually identical for all the mutants. This was confirmed using 125I-Abs and measuring the cpm in the pellet and supernatant (not shown). Fig.2 shows the structure of CH1 domain and the position of the loop involved in the C3b binding. The production of chimeric or mutant Abs by SP2/0 cells was low, around 0.5–0.8 mg/ml ascites. However, because the production of recombinant Abs structurally identical to the native Abs was an essential requirement and dependent on glycosylation, we selected these cells for the production of the Abs. The purification process, followed by SDS-PAGE, is shown in Fig. 3. It can be observed by comparing lanes 3 and 4 that the polyclonal host Abs are removed onto the HSA-Sepharose column and the chimeric Abs appear with the characteristic single monoclonal bands defining the H and L chains at about 50 and 25 kDa. All the Ab mutants and the scAb (7Muñoz E. Vidarte L. Casado M.T. Pastor C. Vivanco F. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) were affinity-purified in the same way and used in the subsequent experiments.Figure 2Shown is a three-dimensional structure of the CH1 domain showing the β-strands (green ribbons) and the loop involved in C3b binding (residues 132–139) in red.

Muñoz E. Vidarte L. Pastor C. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the SDS-PAGE analysis of this C3b binding assay carried out in the presence of [1-14C]acetamide. When C3b binds to rabbit or human IgG1 immune complexes, covalent adducts are formed that are detected by SDS-PAGE as two characteristic bands (named A and B, see the Introduction). Fig. 4A shows the presence and identification of these bands with ICs formed with the chAb (stained gel). Autoradiography of this gel shows that both bands, A and B, appear intensively labeled, indicating the presence of C3b in both bands. When EDTA was included in the assay, which prevents activation of complement, the high molecular mass bands are not formed, indicating the specificity of the assay. To determine the composition of these bands, they were treated with anti-Fc and anti-C3 antisera in Western blot experiments. Band A was only positive with the anti-C3 antiserum, whereas band B was stained with both antisera, indicating the presence of C3 and H chain of the Ab in this band (Fig. 4A). Taken together these data demonstrate the presence of C3 fragments (bands A and B) and H (band B) in the high molecular mass bands. The nature of the polypeptides present in each A and B band was determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. A track as shown in the first dimension gel (Fig. 4A) but using 500 μg of IC was treated with 1 m NH2OH for 90 min at 37 °C and applied in the second gel. The result is presented in Fig. 4B (stained gel). Band A of the first dimension was mostly dissociated into spots of 65 and 43 kDa, indicating that it contains C3α65·C3α43 covalent adducts linked by an ester bond sensitive to hydroxylamine. A residual amount of band A does not dissociate, remaining in the diagonal. Likewise, band B released two major spots of 65 and 50 kDa, which correspond to C3α65·H covalent complexes sensitive to hydroxylamine. The same spot pattern was obtained if the ICs were previously alkylated with iodoacetamide. These data indicate that chimeric antibody, like rabbit or human IgG1, activates the alternative pathway of complement, forming C3b·C3b·chAb covalent complexes (1Vivanco F. Muñoz E. Vidarte L. Pastor C. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Barrio E. Antón L.C. Marqués G. Sánchez A. Vivanco F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Muñoz E. Vidarte L. Casado M.T. Pastor C. Vivanco F. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The first mutant antibodies to be examined were those with multiple substitutions (Ser-134–Thr-135–Ser-136: mutant STS456) in the central positions of the loop. Fig. 5A shows the results of these assays in comparison with the chimeric antibody (positive control) and to scAb, which lacks the CH1 domain (negative control). The amount of C3b bound by scAb is significantly lower than that of a complete antibody since it binds C3b exclusively on the Fc region (7Muñoz E. Vidarte L. Casado M.T. Pastor C. Vivanco F. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It is observed that mutant STS456 was not affected by the multiple mutations at three consecutive positions (134), and the intensity of band B was comparable with that chimeric antibody. Modeling of these mutated positions showed small rearrangements that involved minimum displacements of about 4–5 Å of the side chains with respect to the native antibody (not shown). Anyhow, the possible rearrangement did not affect the interaction with C3b. We then studied single antibody mutants (Ser-134, Thr-135, and Ser-136) to confirm the data obtained with the STS456 antibody. As can be observed in Fig.5A none of the antibodies mutated in one single position showed any decrease in the intensity of band B. In the case of the Ser-136 mutant, the intensity of band B was even greater than that of chAb (control). Thus, these data confirm the results obtained with the STS456 mutant, indicating that none of these residues is responsible for the covalent anchorage of C3b. When double mutants at positions 131–132 were studied, it was observed (Fig. 5B) that SS12 mutant antibody has an impaired ability to bind C3b, as shown by a significant decrease in the intensity of band B, suggesting the abolition of the C3b binding site in this mutant. This decrease is equivalent to that displayed by scAb in comparison with the chimeric antibody. The analysis of C3b binding to single, individual mutants, at position 131 (Ser-131:Ser-131) and 132 (Ser-132:Ser-132) was performed to identify which residue was responsible for the diminished C3b binding in SS12 mutant. The decreased intensity of band B observed with the Ser-132 mutant is similar to that previously observed with the mutant antibody SS12 (Fig.5B), whereas in the case of mutant Ser-131 the intensity of band B was not significantly altered. These data indicate that the mutation at position 132 is responsible for the lack of activity in the SS12 double mutant and strongly supports Ser-132 as the major C3b attachment point in this region of the CH1 domain. We then examined two mutants at multiple positions, SS12STS456, and the latter also included position 139 (SS12STS456T9). Both showed a decreased band B similar to that of double (SS12) or single (Ser-132) mutated Abs (Fig. 5C), corroborating the importance of Ser-132 in the covalent attachment of C3b. When similar experiments were performed with antibodies mutated at position 139 (mutant T139A), no decrease was observed in band B, indicating that this residue was not involved in C3b binding (Fig. 5C). C3 covalent binding to F(ab′)2·IC was studied in the same way as with complete Abs. A comparison of the formation of high molecular mass bands on SDS-PAGE of F(ab′)2·IC with the chimeric IgG·IC is shown in Fig.6A. Band A appears in the same position in both cases, whereas a new band, B′, was detected at about 100 kDa with the F(ab′)2·IC. The two-dimensional gel (Fig. 6B) showed that band A dissociates into two spots of 65 and 43 kDa, and band B′ dissociates into two components of 65 and 23 kDa. Thus, band A is the same as that observed with IgG (C3α65·C3α43), and band B′ corresponds to the C3α65·Fd fragment complex. Figs. 6, C and D, shows the formation and quantitation, respectively, of band B′ using the F(ab′)2 fragment from several mutants. It can be observed that band B′ almost totally disappears (>95%) from the F(ab′)2 fragments mutated at position 132. In contrast, no variations are detected in the other F(ab′)2 mutants. Thus, data from F(ab′)2 fragments confirm those obtained with the complete mutant antibodies and indicate that Ser-132 is the major binding site of C3b on the Fab region of IgG. The putative binding of C3b to V domains has repeatedly been suggested (25Morrison S.L. Porter S.B. Trinnh K.R. Wims L.A. Denham J. Oi V.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2802-2808PubMed Google Scholar, 26Horgan C. Brown K. Pinkus S.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 127-135PubMed Google Scholar), although direct experimental evidence is still lacking. In this work the covalent attachment point of C3b to the CH1 domain of human IgG1 has been determined by means of mutant antibodies. Using a chimeric antibody (V mouse, C human) as reference, we introduced mutations that result in the substitution of Ser and Thr residues by Ala. The absence of hydroxyl groups rules out any possibility of forming ester bonds with C3b. All the mutations were restricted to the first loop of the CH1 domain (residues 125–147), previously identified as a C3b binding region (10Shohet J. Bergamaschini L. Davis A.E. Carroll M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18520-18524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shohet J. Pemberton P. Carroll M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5866-5871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of binding assays with the mutant Abs showed an intense decrease of C3b binding to those Abs that lack the hydroxyl group at position 132 (Fig.5). These data highlight the importance of this Fab region (125) in C3b binding and the key role of Ser-132. All the mutants containing this substitution (Ser-132 → Ala) showed a similar decrease in the intensity of band B. Mutation at Ser-132 produces an effect similar to the removal of the entire CH1 domain, because the amount of C3b bound by the mutant is equivalent to that of scAb. The binding ability of the remaining mutant Abs, which have Ser-132, is similar to that of chimeric Ab (Fig. 5). Replacing Ser and Thr (polar residues) by Ala (apolar) produces only very small conformational alterations in the loop, since the gross conformation of the CH1 is dominated by the β-strands (27Poljack R.J. Amzel L.M. Chen B.L. Phizackerly R.P. Saul F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3440-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Ser-134, Thr-135, and Ser-136 are situated in the center of the loop; therefore, their substitution by Ala would affect the conformation of the loop to a great extent than the residues situated around the edges (Ser-131, Ser-132, or Thr-139). A maximum displacement of 5 Å in the hydroxyl of Thr-135 was calculated by modeling these mutants. However, mutant Abs in the central positions (134) have not altered their ability to interact with C3b (Fig. 5, A and B), ruling out the participation of these residues in binding to C3b. In contrast, the conformation of residues close to the β-sheet (Ser-131, Ser-132, and Thr-139) are not predicted to be altered by the mutations. Consequently, the loss of ability to interact with C3b, observed in mutant at Ser-132, should be exclusively due to the lack of the hydroxyl group in this residue. Thus, the association between Ser-132 and the decreased intensity of band B identifies this Ser as the attachment point of C3b within the loop. Sahu and Pangburn (12Sahu A. Pangburn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28997-29002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) synthesized a series of peptide analogs of the binding region (positions 125–147) to identify the residue favored for C3b attachment. The parent peptide included all six hydroxyl-containing amino acids present in the proposed binding site. Site-specific amino acid substitution of Thr and Ser residues in the peptide indicated little or no attachment occurred at Ser residues, and Thr-135 was proposed as the main residue involved in C3b covalent binding to IgG. However, this could be the consequence of the higher reactivity of Thr residues in comparison with Ser (28Sahu A. Pangburn M.K. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 711-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Sahu A. Kozel T.R. Pangburn M.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All the peptides were small (4–11 amino acids), and only the largest spanned the complete region, with an affinity 20-fold less than for the IgG1 (12Sahu A. Pangburn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28997-29002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In solution these peptides can adopt multiple unrestricted conformations that presumably do not mimic the very characteristic shape of the loop that contains the Ser-132 in the native conformation of IgG (Fig. 2). The reactivity of the thioester group of C3b has been studied with numerous small molecules (30Sahu A. Pangburn M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This group is located in an environment of restricted access that conditions the specificity of C3b with its targets. C3b binding to the CH1 domain of the Ab takes place in a region with several Ser and Thr residues exposed to the solvent, which might facilitate the interaction of both proteins. However, only Ser-132 is the site of anchorage, even when there is another Ser in the adjacent position (Ser-131). Ser-132 is located at the end of the β-strand A (strand A-loop-strand B; Fig. 2), and its conformation is dependent on the structure of the β-sheet. The side chain of Ser-132 is totally exposed to solvent in a fixed position. This can favor its interaction with C3b in comparison with the other hydroxylated residues in the center of the loop, which have more freedom to move. In contrast, Ser-131 is only partially exposed (Fig.7). The position of Ser-132 could explain the fact that C3b binds much more efficiently to IgG in the ICs than to free, monomeric IgG. In solution, Ab molecules have a marked segmental flexibility, which permits the Fab arms to move freely (to wave and rotate). However, once the interaction with the Ags has taken place, a three-dimensional lattice is formed which fixes the position of the Fabs. This generates a high concentration of C3b acceptor sites on the IC that can favor the interaction with C3b. The high local concentration of C3b binding sites on the ICs and the lack of mobility could be factors that favor the binding of C3b to ICs. C3b is able to bind covalently to free monomeric IgG but only when the Ab concentration is extremely high, as occurs in the case of infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (31Lutz H.U. Stammler P. Jlezarova E. Nater M. Späth P. Blood. 1996; 88: 184-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ser-132 is situated in the Fab, very near to the hinge region (32Marquart M. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 141: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), in the groove generated by the interaction of the CH1-CL domains (Fig. 7). In IgG1, this position is adjacent to the Cys-220 (32Marquart M. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 141: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) involved in the formation of the inter H-L disulfide bridge. In the other IgG subclasses (2, 3, and 4), Cys-131 (33Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foelter C. Proteins of Immunological Interest. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1991Google Scholar) is the residue implicated in the disulfide bond with the L chain. This particular position of Ser-132 can explain previous data demonstrating the lack of ability to activate the alternative pathway of complement by IgG molecules with the inter H-L bond reduced (14Albar J.P. Juarez C. Vivanco F. Bragado R. Ortiz F. Mol. Immunol. 1981; 18: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,34Gadd K.J. Reid K.B.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Probably the cancellation of this disulfide bond disturbs this region, modifying the accessibility of Ser-132, impairing its interaction with the carbonyl group of the thioester of C3b. In addition, the interaction of C3b with Ser-132 could help explain the effects of C3b on the solubilization of ICs. This binding region (positions 125–147) is adjacent to residues 148–150, a component of a ball and socket point that exists between V and C domains. This structure has been hypothesized to modulate the V-C flexibility of the Fab (36Lesk A.M. Chotia C. Nature. 1988; 335: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and has recently been shown to be an important functional element of Ab structure (37Landolfi N.F. Thakur A.B. Fu H. Vasquez M. Queen C. Tsurushita N. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1748-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Covalent binding of C3b to this region can modify the V-C flexibility of Fabs in the ICs and facilitate their disruption. Furthermore, C3b is a large molecule (about 180 kDa) that, if bound to the CH1 domain, could interfere with Ag·Ab binding and with the Fc-Fc interactions, preventing the formation of the Ag·Ab lattice and leading to its disaggregation. The anchorage of C3b directly on the Fc regions (1Vivanco F. Muñoz E. Vidarte L. Pastor C. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 8Antón L.C. Ruiz S. Barrio E. Marqués G. Sánchez A. Vivanco F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) would enhance the solubilizing effect. Recent developments in genetic engineering now allow the production of designer antibodies of the desired specificity (38Kontermann R. Dübel S. Antibody Engineering. Springer Lab Manual, Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001Crossref Google Scholar). However, for use in therapy, Ab effector functions need to be controlled according to the specific use of each Ab. The majority of these functions (complement activation, interaction with Fc receptors, catabolism, etc.) reside in the Fc portion of IgG and have been manipulated genetically to eliminate (39Reddy M. Kinney C. Chaikin M.A. Payne A. Lobell J. Tsui P. Dal Monte P. Doyle M.L. Burke M.R. Anderson D. Reff M. Newman R. Hanna N. Sweet R.W. Truneh A. J.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 2571-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The present work adds a novel possibility for the design of Ab molecules, allowing the abolishment or attenuation of the main function known to reside in the CH1 domain. The replacement of Ser-132 by Ala abolishes the ability of the Fab region to bind C3b and to activate the alternative pathway of complement. This kind of modification, by point mutation, is highly advantageous because it neither alters the CH1 domain nor the effector functions expressed by the Fc region. Work is in progress to identify the Fc residues involved in C3b covalent binding."

However, the change to E5 is not yet established, and this paper represents a transition in nomenclature. open reading frame of bovine papillomavirus type 4 encodes a small (42-residue) hydrophobic polypeptide that can transform rodent fibroblasts (1O'Brien V. Campo M.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). E5/E8 is a member of the E5 family of membrane-localized transforming proteins (2Jackson M.E. O'Brien V. Morgan I.M. Grindlay G.J. Saveria Campo M. Int. J. Oncol. 1996; 9: 1189-1199PubMed Google Scholar). It has been postulated that BPV-1 E5 transforms cells by at least two distinct but complementary mechanisms as follows: (i) ligand-independent activation of tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors facilitated by E5-induced dimerization (3Petti L. Nilson L.A. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 4Petti L. DiMaio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2570-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and (ii) through direct interaction with ductin, a highly conserved component of the vacuolar proton ATPase (7Goldstein D.J. Finbow M.E. Andresson T. McLean P. Smith K. Bubb V. Schlegel R. Nature. 1991; 352: 347-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) resulting in the disruption of pH homeostasis in endomembranes and cell transformation by a poorly defined mechanism, which likely involves perturbation of protein/lipid metabolism/trafficking through inhibition of the vacuolar proton ATPase (8Schapiro F. Sparkowski J. Adduci A. Suprynowicz F. Schlegel R. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined if E5/E8 can physically and/or functionally interact with tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, although it is clear that E5/E8 can interact with ductin, at least in vitro, suggesting that it may have similar transforming mechanisms to other E5 family members (9Faccini A.M.

J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our approach has been to analyze alterations in the expression and function of key cell cycle regulators in NIH-3T3 cells transformed by E5/E8 to gain a better understanding of the signaling pathways that are utilized by E5/E8 and that result in a loss of both adhesion and mitogen requirements for cell proliferation. Cyclin-CDK2 complexes are candidates to integrate extracellular (mitogen and anti-mitogenic) signals with the cell cycle machinery. A key function of the cyclin-dependent kinases is to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), resulting in inactivation of this protein as a transcriptional repressor of key genes required for S-phase entry (11Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4310) Google Scholar, 12Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). CDK inhibitors (CKIs) antagonize the catalytic activity of cyclin-dependent kinases, and the activity of these inhibitors is also governed by extracellular factors operating through receptor-mediated signaling pathways. The different CKIs may be responsible for promoting and/or maintaining cells in a quiescent state, and depending on the cell type, this may be a prelude to terminal differentiation. Work from a number of laboratories has demonstrated that cyclin D-CDK complexes play a non-catalytic role in facilitating cell cycle entry and G1 progression by sequestering p21 and p27 into higher order complexes, which retain catalytic activity and aid in the nuclear import of cyclin D-CDK complexes. Sequestration functions to relieve cyclin E-CDK2 complexes from the inhibitory activity of CKIs (reviewed in Ref. 13Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5143) Google Scholar). A common feature of a number of transformed cells and tumors is a low p27 expression level. Low p27 levels correlate with aggressive tumor growth (reviewed in Ref. 14Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and in some tumors, lack of p27 is an independent indicator of poor clinical prognosis (15Tan P. Cady B. Wanner M. Worland P.

Pagano M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Many dominantly acting oncogenes target p27 expression and/or function, at least in vitro. A number of studies in cell lines have revealed that c-Myc overexpression overcomes a p27-mediated cell cycle arrest by promoting down-regulation of p27 expression. Oncogenic Ras, alone or in concert with c-Myc, may also down-regulate p27 (17Vlach J. Hennecke S. Alevizopoulos K. Conti D. Amati B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 18Leone G. DeGregori J. Sears R. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5321-5333Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), whereas c-Myc expression may also interfere with the binding of residual p27 to cyclin E-CDK2 (17Vlach J. Hennecke S. Alevizopoulos K. Conti D. Amati B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Viral transforming proteins such as E7 from human papillomavirus type 16 (21) and adenovirus E1A also appear to inactivate p27, although the following two reports have highlighted different mechanisms of action for E1A: in one case by direct interaction with p27 to prevent cyclin-CDK inhibition (22Mal A. Poon R.Y.C. Howe P.H. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Harter M.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and the other reported a bypass in p27 G1-arrest independent of a physical interaction between E1A and p27 (23Alevizopoulos K. Catarin B. Vlach J. Amati B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5987-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Given that p27 is a major negative regulator of G1progression, our initial finding that p27 levels remain high in E5/E8-transformed cells prompted us to investigate further this unusual situation. Here we have tested how E5/E8 prevents p27 functioning efficiently as a CDK2 inhibitor, and we investigated the mechanism used to achieve constitutive, elevated p27 expression in E5/E8 cells. Intriguingly, p27 remains predominantly nuclear and remains functional as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Cyclin D1 expression is elevated in E5/E8 cells, and there is an increase in the abundance of cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes, and most of the p27 in E5/E8 cells is associated with these complexes. p27 immunoprecipitates from E5/E8 cells have substantial pRB kinase activity but little or no histone H1 kinase activity, whereas cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates contain elevated levels of pRB kinase activity. Together these results demonstrate that E5/E8 cells contain elevated levels of active p27-D1-CDK4 ternary complexes. In agreement with this, pRB is constitutively hyperphosphorylated in E5/E8 cells. Both the steady-state level of p27 mRNA and the protein half-life are unaltered in E5/E8 cells, and the increased steady-state level of p27 is achieved largely through increased protein synthesis, most likely increased translation. This is the first report of enhanced p27 synthesis as the main mechanism for increasing protein levels in continuously cycling cells. Our results are consistent with a model in which E5/E8 promotes a coordinated elevation of p27 and cyclin D1 to provide raised and constitutively active cyclin D1-CDK4 activity which, together with elevated cyclin A-CDK activity, acts to enforce pRB inactivation, allowing continued proliferation in the absence of mitogens. NIH-3T3 cells expressing E5/E8 have been described previously (1O'Brien V. Campo M.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, the results presented below were obtained using E5/E8 clone 1 (E5/E8.1). Cells were also transfected with pT24, an expression plasmid for oncogenic ras (c-Ha-RasV12G), together with a selection marker (pZipneo), using a standard calcium phosphate protocol. Cells were selected for G418 resistance, and clonal populations were derived by ring cloning and expansion in culture medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. Ras expression was confirmed by Western blotting. All cells were maintained as described previously (1O'Brien V. Campo M.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in medium containing [3H]leucine (400 μCi/ml) for 20 h and then lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (see below). E5/E8 was immunoprecipitated using affinity-purified E5/E8 antisera generated in two different rabbits (r280 and r281) against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide representing the hydrophilic C terminus of E5/E8 (residues 31–42, LISTITRLDGWD). Precipitated proteins were washed, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then impregnated with EA Wax according to the manufacturer's instructions and exposed to photographic film. Fluorographs were developed after 6 weeks at −70 °C. Cells were grown in chamber slides, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized for 2 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and then washed in PBS and incubated in block buffer (PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibody was incubated with the fixed cells for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were detected using the following antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: cyclin A (sc-596), cyclin D1 (sc-450), CDK4 (SC-260), and p27 (sc-528). After 3 washes in block buffer, cells were incubated with 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated, anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories) in block buffer for 45 min. Slides were washed, as above, mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and then viewed under a Leitz Ortholux fluorescence microscope. Immunoblotting and immune complex kinase assays were performed as described before (1O'Brien V. Campo M.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The anti-α-tubulin antibody was from Sigma (T-9026). For coupled immunoprecipitations/Western blots, 500-μg samples were adjusted to 1 mg/ml protein in lysis buffer (1O'Brien V. Campo M.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and pre-cleared for 1 h at 4 °C using normal IgG (1 μg/ml), 10 μl of protein A-agarose, and 25 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of Sepharose beads (Sigma, CL-4B-200) in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation was performed on pre-cleared lysates using 2 μl (or 5 μl for agarose conjugates) of the following antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: cyclin D1 (sc-450-AC), cyclin D3 (sc-163), CDK4 (sc-601-AC), and p27 (sc-528). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to CDK4 (sc-260) and p27 (sc-528). To analyze cyclin D1- and D3-associated pRB kinase activity, immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. Kinase reactions were carried out as described before (1O'Brien V. Campo M.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but only non-radioactive ATP was used. The extent of substrate (0.5 μg per sample of GST-pRB; amino acids 769–921 of pRB of mouse origin) phosphorylation on Ser-780, a site preferentially phosphorylated by cyclin D-CDK complexes, was determined using an antibody against an epitope containing phosphorylated Ser-780 (New England Biolabs). Parallel samples were run on SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure equal amounts of substrate were included in each kinase reaction. For heat treatment experiments, p27 immunoprecipitates or total cellular extracts prepared by sonication in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl and clarified by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) were heated at 100 °C for 3 min, quenched on ice, and then added to cyclin E or cyclin A complexes immunoprecipitated from extracts prepared from control and E5/E8 cells grown under normal conditions. In some cases p27 was immunoprecipitated from extracts prepared by sonication/centrifugation, as described above, and then heat-treated. This fraction should represent the total cellular pool of p27 available to the antibody. All heat-treated extracts/immunoprecipitates were clarified by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) and used for kinase assays as described above. For immunodepletion experiments, two rounds of immunoprecipitation were performed as described above (each round for 1 h at 4 °C). Controls used irrelevant antibodies or normal rabbit IgG fractions for mock depletion. Total RNA was prepared using RNazol following the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of RNA were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled, random-primed cDNA probes for p27 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (loading control). The p27 probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction using mouse p27 cDNA as template (pCMV-p27 expression vector, a gift from Dr. R. Bernards) and primers homologous to the N terminus of p27 as follows: 5′-CGAGCCTGGAGCGGATGGAC-3′ and 5′-GCGAGAACCGTCTGAAAC-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Hybridization was performed for 16–18 h at 42 °C in 1% SDS, 2× SSC, 50% formamide, pH 7.4. Blots were washed twice in 1% SDS, 2× SSC, pH 7.4, at 42 °C and twice more in 0.1% SDS in 2× SSC, pH 7.4, at room temperature, dried, and exposed to photographic film. To detect E5/E8 we used metabolic labeling with [3H]leucine as this amino acid residue constitutes ∼25% of the protein. After long term labeling, immunoprecipitation was carried out with antisera raised against a synthetic peptide representing residues 32–44 of E5/E8. Polypeptides (Mr ∼14,000, ∼40,000, and above the 46,000 molecular weight marker), which can be eliminated by preincubation of the antiserum with the immunizing peptide prior to immunoprecipitation, were precipitated only from E5/E8 transfectants (indicated by arrowed asterisks in Fig.1). The aberrant migration of these proteins (the predicted size of E5/E8 is ∼7 kDa) may represent a low ratio of SDS:peptide binding due to the strong hydrophobic nature of E5/E8 but is also consistent with the formation of dimers (Mr ∼14,000) and higher order oligomers resistant to SDS and dithiothreitol and/or formation of SDS-resistant complexes with cellular protein(s) and/or post-translational modification(s) of E5/E8. Further work is required to identify the precise nature of the protein species precipitated by the antisera. E5/E8 cells express high levels of p27 under normal culture conditions, and these levels are not noticeably altered following mitogen withdrawal (1O'Brien V. Campo M.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We sought to eliminate the possibility that elevated expressions of p27 and cyclin A (Fig.2) were a result of transformationper se of the clone of NIH-3T3 cells used in our studies. To this end, we derived clonal populations of our NIH-3T3 cells transfected with an oncogenic ras (c-Ha-RasV12), and in all cases these cells displayed low levels of p27 (Fig. 2illustrates two representative clones). These results indicate that cell transformation by E5/E8 and c-Ha-RasV12 cause distinct alterations in key components of the cell cycle machinery that likely reflect the fundamentally different ways these two proteins bring about cell transformation. Our initial findings demonstrated that p27 is non-functional in E5/E8-transformed cells as supraphysiological levels of p27 do not correlate with inhibition of cyclin E- and cyclin A-associated kinase activities or cell cycle arrest (1O'Brien V. Campo M.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We reasoned that E5/E8 may operate, in part, by impairing the ability of p27 to block CDK activity and cell cycle progression either by causing sequestration of p27 from the nucleus, its normal site of function, or by inhibiting the function of nuclear p27. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we used immunocytochemistry to reveal the subcellular distribution of p27 in E5/E8 cell lines. We found that p27 in E5/E8 cells is located largely in the cell nucleus in asynchronous populations (Fig. 3 A). Similar results were obtained for two other clonal lines and in pooled populations of transfectants (data not shown) indicating that increased expression and nuclear localization of p27 is a general feature of E5/E8-transformed cells. Cyclin A (Fig. 3 B) is also predominantly nuclear in asynchronous populations of E5/E8 cells. For both p27 and cyclin A, expression is not strictly cell cycle-specific as immunostaining is near-uniform throughout the asynchronous cell population. We reasoned that p27 could be sequestered by nuclear protein(s), may be intrinsically non-functional in E5/E8 cells as a result of a post-translational modification, or cyclin E- and cyclin A-CDK complexes from E5/E8 cells may be intrinsically resistant to p27 inhibition. We next determined if p27 from E5/E8 cells retained its ability to inhibit cyclin-CDK complexes by exploiting the heat stability of the molecule (25Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar, 26Hengst L. Reed S.I. Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). p27 was immunoprecipitated from both control and E5/E8 cells heated to 100 °C for 2 min, centrifuged briefly, and the supernatant retained. This crude p27 fraction recovered from both control and E5/E8 cells is capable of inhibiting, in a dose-dependent manner, cyclin A and cyclin E-CDK complexes from both cell types (Fig.4 A). In addition, p27 immunoprecipitates from both cell types contained only background levels of kinase activity against histone H1 substrate when measured in the same time frame used routinely to determine total levels of cyclin A and cyclin E-CDK activity (results not shown). Immunoprecipitations using either normal rabbit immunoglobulin or an antibody to an irrelevant antigen (α-tubulin) did not contain any heat-stable activity inhibitory toward cyclin E-CDK2 complexes from control cells (results not shown). This indicates that both cyclin E- and cyclin A-CDK complexes from E5/E8 cells are not intrinsically resistant to p27-mediated inhibition. In support of this conclusion, no obvious differences were detected in the composition of cyclin A complexes immunoprecipitated from both control and E5/E8 cell extracts after long term metabolic labeling using radioactive amino acids (results not shown). Next, we immunodepleted cell extracts of p27 and then performed cyclin A kinase assays on the depleted extracts. As shown in Fig.4 B, there is little or no loss of cyclin A-associated kinase activity from E5/E8 cells even though p27 immunodepletion is efficient (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). We conclude that p27 in E5/E8 cells remains functional as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, but a large proportion of the total cellular pool of p27 is sequestered from cyclin A complexes by heat-labile components. Cyclin D-CDK complexes have been proposed as candidates to sequester p27 and p21 within the cell nucleus allowing activation of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes (13Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5143) Google Scholar, 25Polyak K. Kato J.Y. Solomon M.J. Sherr C.J. Massague J. Roberts J.M. Koff A.

Both p27 and p21, although originally designated broad spectrum cyclin-CDK inhibitors, appear to function in a positive way to promote cyclin D-CDK complex assembly and nuclear targeting but not as effective inhibitors of cyclin D-CDK complexes when the stoichiometry of inhibitor to complex is at or close to parity (27Toyoshima H.

Sequestration of p27 and p21 away from nascent and existing cyclin E-CDK2 complexes permit G1 progression (reviewed in Ref. 13Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5143) Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility that in E5/E8-transformed cells elevated levels of cyclin D-CDK complexes serve as the major or sole sequestering proteins of p27. In E5/E8 cells there is a dramatic elevation in the steady-state expression levels of cyclins D1 and D3 compared with control cells, and expression of these cyclins is largely independent of serum mitogens, whereas in control cells their expression level is much lower and remains largely mitogen-dependent (Fig.5 A). We could not detect cyclin D2 in parental NIH-3T3 cells or in any of our transfected lines derived from these cells (results not shown). Most cyclin D1 (Fig.5 C) and D3 staining (not shown) is nuclear, indicating that they co-localize with p27 and, although CDK4 expression is not noticeably altered (Fig. 5 B), most CDK4 is expressed in the nucleus of E5/E8 cells (Fig. 5 C). There is a small but significant increase in the expression of CDK6 in E5/E8 cells (Fig.5 B), but we have not been able to demonstrate an association between cyclins D1 or D3 and CDK6. Significantly, the levels of cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes are higher in E5/E8 cells, and the majority of the p27 in the cell is associated with these complexes (Fig. 5 D). Ternary complexes of p27-cyclin D1-CDK4 remain functional as p27 immunoprecipitates from E5/E8 cells contain elevated pRB but negligible histone H1 kinase activity, a profile of substrate specificities that is a hallmark of cyclin D-CDK activity (Fig. 6 A, 30). Direct measurement of cyclin D-associated kinase activity in rodent cells is often not possible using standard immune-complex kinase assays (30Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), and we were not able to measure pRB kinase activity in control or E5/E8 cells using a variety of antibodies directed against cyclins D1 or D3 as well as CDK4 and CDK6. Direct measurement of pRB kinase activity in cyclin D1 and D3 immunoprecipitates was achieved using a non-radioactive assay that relies on the identification of specific phosphorylated residues in pRB by immunoblotting. 3D. Riley, personal communication. Using this approach we found that there is substantially more pRB kinase activity in cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates from E5/E8 cells but a decrease in the activity of pRB kinase activity associated with cyclin D3 in the same cells (Fig. 6 B), at least when measured against phosphorylation of serine 780 of pRB, a site preferentially phosphorylated by cyclin D-CDK complexes (12Mittnacht S. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 31Boylan J.F. Sharp D.M. Leffet L. Bowers A. Pan W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The pattern of expression and phosphorylation of pRB and the related proteins, p107 and p130, provided direct evidence for the de-regulation of cyclin D-CDK activity in vivo in E5/E8 cells. In control cells, cell cycle exit was associated with changes in the phosphorylation state and/or abundance of pRB, p107, and p130. Hyperphosphorylated pRB was clearly evident in proliferating cells, whereas only the hypophosphorylated, anti-proliferative form of pRB was present in quiescent cells. In addition, the amount of p107 decreased with cell cycle exit, whereas the abundance of p130 increased (Fig.6 C). Both pRB and p107 are largely hyperphosphorylated in E5/E8 cells (Fig. 6 C), whereas p130 levels are significantly diminished and are not elevated upon growth factor withdrawal (Fig.6 C), consistent with the inability of serum withdrawal to promote quiescence in E5/E8 cells (1O'Brien V. Campo M.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). An increased abundance of p107 and a decreased abundance of p130, as determined by Western blotting, most likely reflect alterations in protein expression, but we cannot rule out that it is due to changes in the affinity of the antibodies used for the different phosphorylated forms of these proteins. Nevertheless, we conclude that E5/E8 expression activates kinasesin vivo that phosphorylate pRB, p107, and p130. Together, these data demonstrate ternary complexes of cyclin D1-CDK4-p27 are more abundant and provide the sole or major p27 sequestering activity in E5/E8 cells. In addition cyclin D1-associated pRB kinase activity is elevated and de-regulated in E5/E8 cells and correlates with constitutive pRB hyperphosphorylation. The steady-state level of p27 is significantly elevated"
https://openalex.org/W2107682880,"Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a metabolic disorder associated with often-fatal ketoacidosis, neurological derangement, and mental retardation. In this study, we identify and characterize two novel type IB MSUD mutations in Israeli patients, which affect the E1β subunit in the decarboxylase (E1) component of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. The recombinant mutant E1 carrying the prevalent S289L-β (TCG → TTG) mutation in the Druze kindred exists as a stable inactive αβ heterodimer. Based on the human E1 structure, the S289L-β mutation disrupts the interactions between Ser-289-β and Glu-290-β′, and between Arg-309-β and Glu-290-β′, which are essential for native α2β2 heterotetrameric assembly. The R133P-β (CGG → CCG) mutation, on the other hand, is inefficiently expressed in Escherichia coli as heterotetramers in a temperature-dependent manner. The R133P-β mutant E1 exhibits significant residual activity but is markedly less stable than the wild-type, as measured by thermal inactivation and free energy change of denaturation. The R133P-β substitution abrogates the coordination of Arg-133-β to Ala-95-β, Glu-96-β, and Ile-97-β, which is important for strand-strand interactions and K+ion binding in the β subunit. These findings provide new insights into folding and assembly of human E1 and will facilitate DNA-based diagnosis for MSUD in the Israeli population. Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a metabolic disorder associated with often-fatal ketoacidosis, neurological derangement, and mental retardation. In this study, we identify and characterize two novel type IB MSUD mutations in Israeli patients, which affect the E1β subunit in the decarboxylase (E1) component of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. The recombinant mutant E1 carrying the prevalent S289L-β (TCG → TTG) mutation in the Druze kindred exists as a stable inactive αβ heterodimer. Based on the human E1 structure, the S289L-β mutation disrupts the interactions between Ser-289-β and Glu-290-β′, and between Arg-309-β and Glu-290-β′, which are essential for native α2β2 heterotetrameric assembly. The R133P-β (CGG → CCG) mutation, on the other hand, is inefficiently expressed in Escherichia coli as heterotetramers in a temperature-dependent manner. The R133P-β mutant E1 exhibits significant residual activity but is markedly less stable than the wild-type, as measured by thermal inactivation and free energy change of denaturation. The R133P-β substitution abrogates the coordination of Arg-133-β to Ala-95-β, Glu-96-β, and Ile-97-β, which is important for strand-strand interactions and K+ion binding in the β subunit. These findings provide new insights into folding and assembly of human E1 and will facilitate DNA-based diagnosis for MSUD in the Israeli population. maple syrup urine disease branched-chain α-ketoacid branched-chain amino acid branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase branched-chain α-ketoacid decarboxylase dihydrolipoyl transacylase dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase fast protein liquid chromatography guanidine hydrochloride α-ketoisovalerate nitrilotriacetic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis thiamine diphosphate Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD)1 or branched-chain ketoaciduria is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder in the catabolism of branched-chain α-ketoacids (BCKAs) derived from branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine (1Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 8th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). The accumulated BCKAs and BCAAs are secreted in the urine, giving rise to a distinct maple syrup odor and hence the name of the disease (2Menkes J.H. Hurst P.L. Craig J.M. Pediatrics. 1954; 14: 462-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on variations of clinical presentation, there are currently five different forms of MSUD (1Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 8th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). The classic form, which accounts for 75% of MSUD patients, is manifested within the first 2 weeks of life by poor feeding, lethargy, seizures, coma, and death if left untreated. Intermediate MSUD is associated with elevated levels of BCAAs and BCKAs, with progressive mental retardation and developmental delay without a history of catastrophic illness. An intermittent form of MSUD has normal levels of BCAAs, normal intelligence, and development until a stress (e.g. infection) precipitates in decompensation with ketoacidosis without seriously affecting intelligence and development. Thiamine-responsive MSUD is similar to the intermediate or intermittent phenotype but responds to pharmacologic doses of thiamine with returns to the normal levels of BCAAs (3Scriver C.R. MacKenzie S. Clow C.L. Deluin E. Lancet. 1971; 1: 310-311Abstract PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The E3-deficient MSUD is caused by defects in the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) (see below). Patients with E3 deficiency have combined enzyme impairments in α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes and usually die in infancy with severe lactic acidosis (4Taylor J. Robinson B.H. Serwood W.G. Pediatr. Res. 1978; 12: 60-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The enzyme affected in MSUD, the mitochondrial branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex, is a multienzyme complex of 4–5 million daltons. It is organized about a 24-meric cubic core of dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2). Attached to the E2 core are multiple copies of branched-chain α-ketoacid decarboxylase (E1), E3, BCKD kinase, and BCKD phosphatase (5Pettit F.H. Yeaman S.J. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4881-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 6Reed L.J. Damuni Z. Merryfield M.L. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1985; 27: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The kinase and the phosphatase tightly regulate activity of the BCKD complex by reversible phosphorylation (inactivation)/dephosphorylation (activation) (7Harris R.A. Paxton R. Powell S.M. Goodwin G.W. Kuntz M.J. Han A.C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1986; 25: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The E1 component is a TDP-dependent enzyme consisting of two α and two β subunits. The E3 component is a homodimeric flavoprotein and is common among α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes comprising pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and BCKD complexes. Therefore, there are six genetic loci that contribute to the BCKD complex, and mutations in the four catalytic subunits (E1α, E1β, E2, and E3) have been reported in MSUD patients (1Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 8th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). On the basis of the affected subunit in the BCKD complex, MSUD is classified into six genetic subtypes (1Chuang D.T. Shih V.E. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. 8th Ed. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1971-2006Google Scholar). Among them, type IA MSUD affects the E1α subunit; type IB affects the E1β subunit; type II affects the E2 subunit; and type III affects the E3 subunit. Type IV and type V MSUD involve the kinase and the phosphatase, respectively, in which the disease-causing mutations have not been detected. The crystal structure of the human E1 α2β2heterotetramer was recently determined to 2.7-Å resolution (8Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 211-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Each of the two binding sites for cofactor TDP is located in the interface between α and β subunits. The E1 structure also discloses that the extended small C-terminal region protruding from the bulk of the E1α subunit is essential for the interaction between heterologous α and β subunits. This segment is referred to as the “Mennonite region” because it contains the type IA Y393N-α mutation, which is prevalent in the Mennonite population (9Fisher C.R. Chuang J.L. Cox R.P. Fisher C.W. Star R.A. Chuang D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Matsuda I. Nobukuni Y. Mitsubuchi H. Indo Y. Endo F. Asaka J. Harada A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The tyrosine to asparagine conversion at position 393 of the α subunits abrogates the interaction between α and β′ as well as α′ and β subunits, thereby preventing heterotetramer assembly, with the mutant E1 locked in an inactive heterodimeric conformation (11Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The other two type IA mutations in the Mennonite region, Y368C-α and F364C-α, also disrupt the heterologous α and β subunit interactions, resulting in the inability to assemble into the native heterotetrameric conformation of E1. We have recently studied MSUD mutations in Israeli patients, in particular those from the non-Jewish Druze kindred. The incidence of MSUD in the kindred is relatively frequent due to consanguinity. We report a homozygous mutation in the Druze MSUD patients, which affects the E1β subunit. This novel type IB mutation apparently disrupts β/β′ subunit interactions, resulting in the formation of inactive E1 heterodimers, similar to the Mennonite Y393N-α type IA substitution (11Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The second type IB mutation, which occurs in Jewish patients in Israel and the U.S., affects the folding and stability of the mutant E1 in a temperature-sensitive manner. The genetic and biochemical information presented here provides structural insights into folding and assembly of the E1 heterotetramer and will facilitate DNA-based detection of these type IB MSUD alleles in the Israeli population. Blood samples (15 ml) were withdrawn from classic MSUD patients A. S., M. N., and F. N. and an intermittent MSUD patient C. G. from the non-Jewish Druze kindred in Israel as well as from a classic Ashkenazi-Jewish Israeli patient (N. P.) in Israel (provided by Dr. O. N. Elpeleg, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel) and a classic Jewish patient (H. D.) in the United States. Lymphoblasts were prepared from blood samples by infection with Epstein-Barr virus (12Miller F. Lipman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Lymphoblast cell cultures were grown as described previously (13Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 413-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homogenates from cultured lymphoblasts were subjected to SDS-PAGE separation and then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were probed with either anti-E2 or anti-E1 (with titers against both E1α and E1β subunits) antibodies, followed by detection with 125I-labeled protein A as described previously (14Fisher C.W. Chuang J.L. Griffin T.A. Lau K.S. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3448-3453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first strand cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA prepared from patients' cells using the OmniscriptTM Reverse Transcriptase from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). The reverse primer B1, 5′-GTAGAACTTTTCAGCCAATATCATGATGG-3′, was designed from the 3′-noncoding region of the human E1β cDNA (15Chuang J.L. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The first round polymerase chain reaction was carried out using the forward primer B2 (5′-GTGCGGCTGCATAGCCTGAG-3′) and the reverse primer B3 (5′-AAAAGAGGTAAGTCGGAGGA-3′). To amplify the 5′ segment of the E1β cDNA, a second round polymerase chain reaction was performed using the forward primer B4 (5′-ATGGCGGTTGTAGCGGC-3′) and the reverse primer B5 (5′-CCAGGCAACTAGAGTAACATC-3′). To amplify the 3′ region of the E1β cDNA, the forward primer B6 (5′-ATACCCCATTGTGTGAACAAGGAATTGTTG-3′) and the reverse primer B3 (see above) were employed. The polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced using an ABI Prism™ model 377 automated DNA sequencer from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The Altered SiteTMin vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to introduce desired mutations into the cDNA of the human E1β subunit. Detailed protocols for the mutant vector construction and subsequent mutagenesis were described previously (16Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Chinsky J.M. Wynn R.M. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides for the desired mutations and the β-lactamase repair primer were annealed to the single-stranded form of pAlter-E1β vector. After the second strand synthesis and two rounds of ampicillin selection, clones harboring the correct mutations were isolated. DNA segments containing the mutations were used for cassette replacements of the expression vector pHis-TEV-E1 for wild-type E1, which contained a His6 affinity tag linked to the N terminus of the E1α subunit (5′ to 3′) (11Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The recombinant His6-tagged E1 heterotetramer was expressed in Escherichia coli strain CG-712 (ESts) by co-transformation of the pGroESL plasmid overproducing chaperonins GroEL and GroES as described previously (17Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Song J.L. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 179-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant His6-tagged E1s were isolated from cell lysates using a Ni2+-NTA-derivatized Sepharose CL-6B column (Qiagen) as described previously (11Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). E1 proteins were further purified on a Superdex-200 gel filtration column (1 × 30 cm) in an FPLC system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The column buffer consisted of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm dithioerythritol, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. E1 activity during purification was assayed radiochemically by reconstitution with E2 and E3 (see below). Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus protein reagent from Pierce with absorbance read at 595 nm. Alternatively, during enzyme purification, protein concentrations were determined by the direct measurement of absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 1.15 cm−1 mg−1 ml−1 for the α2β2 heterotetramer. Cultures (1 liter in size) for the expression of His6-tagged wild-type and mutant E1 were grown at 37 °C until A590 = 0.6 was reached. Aliquots of 50 ml were placed in 100-ml flasks and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cultures were subsequently grown overnight at 23, 28, 33, or 37 °C. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in a lysis buffer comprising 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm TDP, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.01% (w/v) NaN3, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, lysozyme (1 mg/ml), and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm benzamidine). Lysates were clarified by ultracentrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min to sediment unbroken cells and debris. The supernatants (10 ml) were extracted with 100 μl of Ni2+-NTA, which was washed three times (1.5 ml each time) with the above FPLC column buffer containing 15 mm imidazole. The washed Ni2+-NTA resin containing the bound E1 was eluted with the FPLC buffer containing 1m imidazole, and the eluted proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The radiochemical assay based on activity of the reconstituted BCKD complex (20Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 413-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine wild-type and mutant E1 activities following elution of E1 proteins from Ni2+-NTA with 100 mm imidazole. Km andkcat for TDP and substrate α-keto[1-14C]isovalerate (KIV) were determined using the spectrophotometric assay (see below) as reported previously (21Wynn R.M. Ho R. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4168-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The computer program Curve Fit version 0.7e was used to fit the kinetic data and obtain the slopes and intercepts. The purified wild-type and mutant E1 proteins (32 μg/ml) were incubated for various times in an MJR PTC-100 thermal cycler equilibrated at 42 °C. At different time points, aliquots were removed and added to a spectrophotometric assay mixture (21Wynn R.M. Ho R. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4168-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The reduction of NAD+ absorbance at 340 nm at 30 °C was used to determine residual E1 activity by reconstitution with E2 and E3. Rate constants (min−1) were derived from the slopes of the pseudo-first order activity decay, as determined by curve fitting using the program Cricket Graph III for the Macintosh computer. An 8 m stock of GdnHCl was prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Wild-type and mutant E1 proteins (72 μg/ml) were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h in the same buffer containing increasing concentrations of GdnHCl. Emission spectra of tryptophan fluorescence over a range of 300–400-nm wavelengths were obtained with a PerkinElmer luminescence spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 282 nm as described previously (22Hennig J. Kern G. Neef H. Bisswanger H. Hubner G. Bisswanger H. Schellenberger A. Biochemistry and Physiology of Thiamin Diphosphate Enzyme. A. u. C. Intemann, Prien, Germany1966: 243-251Google Scholar). Decreases in intensity of the tryptophan fluorescence were used to calculate the ratio of unfolded to folded protein as a function of increasing GdnHCl concentrations, based on the equationfu = (x ×x0)/(xu ×x0), where fu represents the fraction of unfolded protein; x is the relative fluorescence emission; x0 is the relative fluorescence emission in the absence of GdnHCl, and xu is the relative fluorescence emission of the completely unfolded E1 protein at 4 m GdnHCl. The free energy of denaturation (ΔGGdnHCl) was calculated from the fraction of folded E1 protein over the denaturation transition region (23Qu B.-H. Strickland E.H. Thomas P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15739-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The value ΔGGdnHCl, 0 was obtained by extrapolating to the zero concentration of the denaturant. We studied four unrelated MSUD patients (A. S., C. G., M. N., and F. N.) from the non-Jewish Druze kindred in Israel, an Ashkenazi-Jewish patient (N. P.) also from Israel, and a Jewish patient (H. D.) in the United States. Lymphoblasts from these patients were cultured and assayed for the rate of decarboxylation using KIV as substrate. The four cell lines from the Druze kindred and the Israeli Jewish patient (N. P.) exhibit absent or nearly absent decarboxylation activity compared with normal cells (TableI). The results correlate with a classic MSUD phenotype except C. G., who has an intermittent MSUD phenotype. The United States Jewish patient (H. D.) shows significant residual activity (6% of normal) that does not correlate with the classic MSUD phenotype in this patient.Table IClinical phenotypes and type IB mutations in MSUD patientsPatientAgeSexClinical phenotypePercentage of normal activityaThe decarboxylation rate of α-keto[1-14C]isovalerate with lymphoblasts from normal subjects is in the range of 0.114–0.144 nmol CO2/min/mg of protein.Ethnic originMutationGenotypeyearsA.

Open table in a new tab To locate the subunit of the BCKD complex affected in these patients, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using polyclonal antibodies to E1 (specific for both α and β subunits) or E2 as a probe (24Chuang J.L. Fisher C.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 297-303PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 413-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of E1β subunit ranges from nearly absent to absent in the above six MSUD cell lines, whereas the E1α subunit is present at reduced amounts compared with normal (data not shown). By contrast, the amount of the E2 subunit was normal in these mutant cell lines. The results indicate that the E1β subunit may be affected in these MSUD patients. To identify putative mutations in this subunit, two rounds of polymerase chain reaction were performed to amplify 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of the E1β cDNA synthesized from patients' total RNAs. Nucleotide sequencing of patients' E1β cDNAs disclosed a type IB S289L-β substitution (TCG → TTG) in three homozygous patients (A. S., M. N., and F. N.) and a compound-heterozygous patient (C. G.), all from the Druze kindred (Table I). A second type IB mutation that results in an R133P-β (CGG → CCG) substitution is present in one allele of the non-Druze Israeli patient (N. P.) and both alleles of the United States Jewish patient (H. D.). The His6-tagged S289L-β mutant E1 expressed at 28 °C was extracted from the E. colilysate with Ni2+-NTA, followed by FPLC gel filtration on a Superdex-200 column. Fig. 1Ashows that the wild-type human E1 heterotetramer migrates as a single species and peaks at fraction 32. In contrast, the mutant E1 carrying the S289L-β mutation eluted at fraction 34 as a heterodimer. The same mutant E1 also migrated as a heterodimeric species, when separated on a 10–30% sucrose density gradient by ultracentrifugation (data not shown). The mutant E1 that contains the R133P-β substitution was also expressed at 28 °C using the same expression system. The FPLC gel filtration profile shows that this mutant E1 peaks at fraction 32 as a heterotetramer, similar to wild-type E1. The potential effect of the kink introduced by a proline in the R133P-β mutation on the folding and assembly of E1 was investigated. Cells co-transformed with pHis-TEV-E1 and pGroESL plasmids were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at different temperatures for the expression of wild-type and mutant E1. Fig. 2A shows that the expression of wild-type E1 activity in the Ni2+-NTA extract remains relatively constant in the temperature range of 23–37 °C. However, the expression of residual R133P-β mutant E1 activity is temperature-dependent, with equally high activity obtained at 23 and 28 °C and very low activity at 37 °C. SDS-PAGE analysis of the extracts shows that the levels of the wild-type E1α and E1β subunits at ∼1:1 stoichiometry are similar at different temperatures (Fig. 2B). The slightly lower levels of E1α and E1β subunits at 23 °C than at higher temperatures are due to a slower growth of E. coli at 23 °C. Since only the E1α subunit contains the His6 tag at the N terminus, the untagged E1β subunit isolated in the Ni2+-NTA extract is assembled with the E1α subunit. In contrast, the level of the assembled mutant E1β subunit in R133P-β E1 is sharply reduced, compared with the normal E1α subunit in the mutant. Levels of both the wild-type E1α and the mutant E1β subunits are decreased as the expression temperature is elevated. In particular, the assembled mutant E1β is present at significant levels at 23 and 28 °C but is virtually absent at 37 °C. The E1α and E1β subunits each contains four tryptophan residues, which provide a useful fluorophor for structural studies. Fig. 3 shows that wild-type E1 (curve 1) when excited at 282 nm emits a relatively broad fluorescence spectrum, with two discernible peaks at the 335 nm and 341 nm. The S289L-β mutant E1 (curve 2) shows about one-half of the intensity for tryptophan fluorescence, relative to the same concentration of wild-type E1, with a single peak at 341 nm. The results suggest that about one-half of the tryptophan residues in the wild-type E1 become exposed and are quenched by the solvent in the S289L-β heterodimer. Similar reduced tryptophan fluorescence was observed with the established heterodimeric Y393N-α E1 (curve 3). The data confirm that the S289L-β mutant E1 exists as a heterodimer in solution. The E1 active site that contains the cofactor TDP-binding pocket is at the interface between two heterodimers that are assembled through α/β′ and α′/β subunit interactions in native E1 (8Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 211-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As expected, heterodimers of the S289L-β mutant E1 are enzymatically inactive. The heterotetrameric R133P-β mutant exhibits significant residual BCKD activity when reconstituted with E2 and E3 components. Thekcat values for substrate KIV and TDP for R133P-β E1 are 14 and 21% of the wild-type E1, respectively (TableII). The Km for KIV and TDP are comparable between R133P-β and wild-type E1. Therefore, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of R133P-β E1 is significantly reduced at 26% for KIV and 18% for TDP of the wild-type. The data indicate that the R133P-β alteration also affects catalytic function in the assembled mutant heterotetramer.Table IIKinetic constants (kcat and Km) for wild-type and MSUD mutant E1EnzymeKIVTDPKmkcatkcat/Km(×103)Kmkcatkcat/Km(×103)μms−1s−1μm−1μms−1s−1μm−1Wild type628.251400.668.1612,400R133P-β341.1634.70.81.782,225S289L-β00Kinetic constants for substrate α KIV were determined by measuring reconstituted BCKD activity spectrophotometrically in the presence of excess E2 and E3.

Thermal stability was studied by incubating wild-type and MSUD mutant E1 at 42 °C for different lengths of time. The remaining BCKD enzyme activity was measured by reconstitution with E2 and E3. Inactivation curves of both wild-type and mutant E1 follow pseudo-first-order kinetics as a function of time (Fig. 4). The wild-type E1 and the type IA MSUD mutant N222S-α, which affects the E1 active site (8Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G.J.

The A209D-α type IA mutation, which impedes the α/α′ subunit interaction in E1, produces a mutant E1 that is less stable than the wild-type with akobs of 0.051 min−1. The R133P-β type IB mutation renders the mutant E1 markedly unstable, with akobs value of 0.58 min−1. For comparison, the R252H-α type IA MSUD mutation, which also disrupts the α/α′ subunit interaction (8Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 211-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar), results in a mutant E1 that is as unstable as the R133P-β E1 with a kobs value of 0.38 min−1. The Gibbs' free energy of denaturation for wild-type E1 and type IB MSUD mutants was determined by chemical denaturation of the proteins in the chaotropic reagent GdnHCl. The ratio of unfolded to folded proteins in increasing concentrations of the denaturant was determined by decreases in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig.5, inset). The ratio was used to calculate the free energy change of denaturation (ΔGGdnHCl) at a given GdnHCl concentration (Fig. 5). The free energy change of denaturation in the absence of the denaturant (ΔGGdnHCl, 0) for the wild-type heterotetrameric E1, when extrapolated to zero GdnHCl concentration, is 3.8 kcal/mol (TableIII). The heterodimeric S289L-β mutant E1 is slightly less stable, with a ΔGGdnHCl, 0 of 3.2 kcal/mol. The heterotetrameric R133P-β is the least stable, with a ΔGGdnHCl, 0 of 2.8 kcal/mol and ΔΔGGdnHCl of −1.0 kcal/mol, relative to the wild-type E1 (Table III). The results support the conclusion from the thermal inactivation studies that the R133P-β mutation adversely affects stability of the mutant E1.Table IIIFree energy changes for wild-type and MSUD mutant E1 in GdnHClΔGGdnHCl, 0ΔΔGGdnHCl, 0Cmmkcal/molkcal/molmkcal/mol/mWild type3.81.43.5S289L-β3.2−0.61.02.4R133P-β2.8−1.01.12.7The free energy change of denaturation in GdnHCl (ΔGGdnHCl) is calculated according to the equation ΔG = −RT ln (1/fN − 1), where 1/fN represents the fraction of folded protein. The ΔGGdnHCl, 0 values are obtained by extrapolating the slopes in Fig. 5 to zero concentration of the denaturant.

The occurrence of the homozygous type IB S289L-β mutations in three of the four unrelated Druze patients studied strongly suggests that this allele is prevalent in the non-Jewish kindred, presumably through the practice of consanguinity. The second type IB mutation R133P-β is present in the compound-heterozygous Israeli Jewish patient and in the homozygous United States patient of European-Jewish descent. The data suggest that the R133P-β allele segregates in the Israeli Jewish population outside the Druze kindred. The identification of these two type IB MSUD alleles will facilitate DNA-based diagnosis for this metabolic disorder in the Israeli population in general and the Druze kindred in particular. The recent determination of the three-dimensional structure of human E1 has provided a structural basis for the two type IB MSUD mutations reported here. As shown in Fig.6A, the Ser-289 residue is located in the beginning of helix 11. The two helices 11, each from β and β′ subunits, are contacting one another along a pseudo-2-fold axis of symmetry. Ser-289 in the β subunit is hydrogen-bonded the side chain of Glu-290 in the homologous β′ subunit (Fig.6B). In addition, Arg-309 in the β-subunit forms a salt bridge with Glu-290 in the β′ subunit. The same type of interaction occurs involving Ser-289 in the β′ subunit. The substitution of Ser-289 with a larger hydrophobic Leu residue is likely to disrupt the above polar and ionic interactions at the β/β′ subunit interface, thereby preventing the assembly of αβ and α′β′ heterodimers into a native α2β2heterotetramer. The trapped heterodimers are presumably in a low energy minimum, and are reasonably stable as indicated by the Gibbs' free energy change of denaturation (ΔGGdnHCl, 0) of 3.2 kcal/mol, compared with 3.8 kcal/mol for the wild-type E1 heterotetramer. Previously, we reported that the hydrogen bonding of Tyr-393-α to Asp-328-β′ is essential for α/β′ subunit interaction, which is disrupted by the Y393N-α type IA MSUD mutation in the United States Mennonite population (8Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 211-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (138) Google Scholar). As a result, the mutant E1 is also locked in the inactive heterodimeric conformation. The exclusive presence of inactive E1 heterodimers is consistent with the severe classic phenotype in the Druze and Mennonite MSUD patients, homozygous-affected by the type IB S289L-β and type IA Y393N-α mutations, respectively. Thus, studies of the naturally occurring MSUD mutations have established that both Ser-289-β and Tyr-393-α residues are critical for α/β′ and β/β′ subunit interactions, respectively, and these interactions are essential for the heterotetrameric assembly of native E1. The results illustrate the power of molecular genetics in identifying amino acid residues that are critical for subunit interactions and protein oligomerization. Residue Arg-133-β, on the other hand, is located in the middle of strand E in the β subunit (Fig. 6A). This residue is in close proximity (10 Å in distance) to the novel K+ ion present in the β subunit (Fig. 6C). The side chain of Arg-133-β is ion-paired to the side chain of Glu-96-β in strand D of the same β subunit. Intrasubunit hydrogen bonds occur between the main-chain imino group of Arg-133-β and the main-chain carbonyl group of Ala-95-β as well as between the main-chain carbonyl group of Arg-133-β and the imino group of Ile-97-β. The introduction of a Pro residue at position 133 of the β subunit in the type IB R133P-β mutation produces a kink in the main chain of the β subunit. The altered conformation potentially abolishes the cross talks of Arg-133-β with Ala-95-β, Glu-96-β, and Ile-97-β, which are critical for strand-strand interactions within each individual β subunit. Moreover, Thr-131-β coordinates through a water molecule to the K+ ion in the β subunit. The displacement of strand E carrying the Thr-131-β residue, as a result of the impaired strand-strand interactions may also prevent efficient binding of the K+ ion essential for E1 activity. The structural defects caused by the R133P-β MSUD mutation explain the thermal instability and the significant ΔΔGGdnHCl value of −1.0 kcal/mol, relative to the wild-type E1. This mutation does not appear to hinder the heterotetrameric assembly, since residue Arg-133-β is internal and distant from the subunit interfaces. However, the altered structure caused by the R133P-β substitution also has an adverse effect on catalysis as indicated by the markedly reducedkcat of the mutant enzyme. At present, we cannot delineate the inconsistency between significant residual activity in cultured lymphoblasts and the severe classic phenotype of the homozygous patient carrying the R133P-β mutation (Table I). One can speculate that instability associated with the mutant E1 may result in a rapid turnover in tissues, which accounts for the inability to degrade BCKAs in the patient. We have shown previously that folding and assembly of wild-type E1 heterotetramers is dependent on the presence of chaperonins GroEL and GroES either in E. coli (17Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in vitro (25Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The bacterial chaperonins promote dissociation/reassociation cycles of the heterodimeric intermediate to facilitate its assembly into the native heterotetramer (26Wynn R.M. Song J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2786-2794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Song J.L. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22305-22312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of overexpressed chaperonins, the recombinant mutant E1 containing the S289L-β mutation is trapped in permanent heterodimeric intermediate conformation. The results support the concept that molecular chaperones do not contain steric information capable of correcting the aberrant conformation dictated by the mutation. On the other hand, the expression of the mutant E1 containing the R133P-β substitution inE. coli is facilitated by lowering the expression temperature. At a higher expression temperature (e.g.37 °C), the overexpressed mutant E1β subunit is misfolded and degraded or targeted to the inclusion bodies. The unassembled wild-type E1α subunit is unstable at 37 °C and is therefore present in a markedly reduced amount in the supernatant compared with the wild-type heterotetramer (Fig. 2B). At low expression temperature (e.g. 23 or 28 °C), a fraction of folded R133P-β mutant E1β subunit is able to assemble with the wild-type E1α subunit to produce the partially active heterotetramer (Fig. 2A). A large excess of unassembled E1α subunit is stable at 23 and 28 °C and remains in the supernatant, although at lower than wild-type levels. The expression data, taken together, strongly suggest that the R133P-β mutation results in a folding defect, which is partially ameliorated by the slow folding kinetics, when overexpressed at ambient temperatures and assisted by chaperonins GroEL and GroES. We are indebted to Dr. O. N. Elpeleg for kindly supplying the sample of an MSUD patient for this study and to Mischa Machius for generous help in producing molecular graphics of the E1 structure."

We are interested in understanding regulation of the testis-specific member of theldh gene family (ldhc), which encodes the C subunit of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-C4) (2Zhou W. Xu J. Goldberg E.

Theldhc gene product is present only in developing and mature germ cells from the preleptotene-zygotene stage to the differentiated spermatozoan. The mechanism/s by which this gene is silenced in somatic tissues as well as during the early stages of spermatogenesis have not been resolved. Transcription factors for activation or repression of the gene have yet to be identified. However, previous work demonstrating testis-specific expression with a 60-bp1fragment of the mouse ldhc gene (2Zhou W. Xu J. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) implicated a 31-bp palindrome sequence that overlaps the TATA box and the transcription initiation site. This was confirmed with a transgene containing 100 bp of the promoter (3Li S. Zhou W. Doglio L. Goldberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31191-31194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The palindrome sequence binds proteins from testis and liver nuclear extracts in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Southwestern analysis reveals binding to a 105-kDa protein extracted from testis nuclei and a 65-kDa protein from liver nuclear extracts (2Zhou W. Xu J. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Functional activity has been demonstrated by in vitro transcription assays using a promoter fragment with either the wild-type sequence or with random mutations introduced in the center or in the 5′-flanking region of the palindrome (4Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutations in the center of the palindrome resulted in a loss of promoter activity with testis nuclear extracts, suggesting that an activator bound at this site. Random mutations in the 5′-flanking region of themldhc promoter had no effect on activity with testis nuclear extracts but did result in a low but significant activity using liver nuclear extracts. This finding indicated that a repressor bound at this site in somatic tissues. The presence of a repressor was also suggested by the observation that liver nuclear extracts when added to testis nuclear extracts lowered the activity of the promoter (5Zhou W. Transcriptional Regulation of the Murine Testis-specific Lactate Dehydrogenase c Gene.Ph.D. thesis. Northwestern University, Evanston, IL1994Google Scholar). Additionally, competition with the palindromic oligonucleotide resulted in a low but significant activity by the otherwise silentmldhc promoter in liver nuclear extracts (5Zhou W. Transcriptional Regulation of the Murine Testis-specific Lactate Dehydrogenase c Gene.Ph.D. thesis. Northwestern University, Evanston, IL1994Google Scholar). In this report we describe a mechanism by which the mldhcgene is silenced in somatic tissues. We demonstrate that the NF-I/CTF (CCAAT box transcription factor) protein family binds to the palindrome and functions as a repressor of mouse ldhc gene expression. The NF-I proteins are encoded in mammals by four genes,Nf1a, Nf1b, Nf1c and Nf1x(6Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and are involved in transcriptional activation as well as viral replication. There is increasing evidence, however, that NF-I proteins also function in negative regulation (6Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Equimolar quantities of the sense and antisense strands were mixed in STE (TE with 100 mm NaCl) and annealed by boiling for 2 min and cooling gradually to room temperature. Wild type palindrome (P) sequence was ATAACTGTTGGCTCCTGGACCCAACAGTTAT (31 bp); oligo I, ATAACTGTTGGCTCCTGGACC (21 bp); oligo II, TGTTGGCTCCTGGACCCAACA (21 bp); oligo III, GCTCCTGGACCCAACAGTTAT (21 bp). Oligos A–K were 22 bp in length and had 2-bp mutations introduced successively in oligo II. Oligo A was taGTTGGCTCCTGGACCCAACA; oligo B, CTcgTGGCTCCTGGACCCAACA; oligo C, CTGTaaGCTCCTGGACCCAACA; oligo D, CTGTTGtaTCCTGGACCCAACA; oligo E, CTGTTGGCagCTGGACCCAACA; oligo F, CTGTTGGCTCacGGACCCAACA; oligo G, CTGTTGGCTCCTtaACCCAACA; oligo H, CTGTTGGCTCCTGGgaCCAACA; oligo I, CTGTTGGCTCCTGGACgaAACA; oligo J, CTGTTGGCTCCTGGACCCctCA; oligo K, CTGTTGGCTCCTGGACCCAAac. Other oligonucleotides used were adenoviral NF-I (NF-I), TTTTGGATTGAAGCCAATATGATAA; mutated NF-I (NFI*), TTTTGGATTGAAGtaaATATGATAA; mutated NF-I (NFI**), TTTaatATTGAAGCCAATATGATAA; and Sp1, ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC. All oligonucleotides are sense oligonucleotides and are written in a 5′ to 3′ direction. Substitutions introduced in oligos A–K and mutated NF-I oligos are indicated by lowercase letters. The consensus binding elements for Sp1 and NF-I are based on the sequence from the Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog. A 430-bpmldhc 5′ flanking region fragment (−425 to +10) was amplified by PCR using the 5′ sense oligonucleotide Xhosens(5′-CCGCTCGAGGTCTACAGAGTTCCAGGACG-3′) (corresponding to −425 to −406 and including an XhoI site), and a 3′ antisense oligonucleotide, (5′-CCGAAGCTTATAACTGTTGGGTCCAGGAGCC-3′) (corresponding to +10 to −12 and containing a HindIII site). The template was a pNAssβ (CLONTECH) vector, which contained the mldhc fragment (−425 to +10) cloned at theEcoRI/XhoI site. The amplified fragment was digested with XhoI/HindIII and cloned into the pβ-gal basic vector (CLONTECH) to give pWT. For generating mutations in the palindrome, PCR amplification was carried out using pWT as template and oligonucleotide Xhosens as 5′ sense primer. The antisense 3′ primers were MutBC(5′-CCCAAGCTTATAACTGTTGGGTCCAGGAGCttcgAGTTATAACGG-3′) corresponding to +10 to −26 and MutI(5′-CCCAAGCTTATAACTGTTtcGTCCAGGAGCCAACAG-3′) corresponding to +10 to −17. The PCR product was digested withXhoI/HindIII and cloned into pβ-gal basic vector to give pMutBC and pMutI. Mutation at site GH was generated in two steps. In the first step, the mutation was introduced by using the 5′ sense primer Xhosensand the 3′ antisense primer MutGH(5′-TTTTGGtctaAGGAGCCAACAGTTATAACGG-3′) (+1 to −26) containing a mutation at site GH. The template was pWT. The PCR product was used as a template for a second PCR amplification to introduce aHindIII site using the 5′ Xhosens primer and the antisense primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTATAACTGTTGGtctaAGGAGC-3′ (+10 to −11). The PCR product was digested with XhoI andHindIII and then cloned in pβ-gal basic vector to give pMutGH. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm ligated ends, the generation of the mutation, and the PCR amplification sequence. Mammalian expression vectors for NF-IA (pCHNFIA), NF-IB (pCHNFIB), NF-IC (pCHNFIC), and NF-IX (pCHNFIX) as well as the empty vector pCH were a generous gift from Prof. R. Gronostajski (Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH). The expression vector for CCAAT displacement protein, pMT2CDP, and the control pMT2 vector were obtained from Prof. E. J. Neufeld (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Nuclear extracts were prepared from adult CD-1 mouse livers. The livers were dissected from 15 mice, minced, and homogenized in buffer as described previously (2Zhou W. Xu J. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Testes from 50 mice were decapsulated, minced, and homogenized. Freshly prepared proteinase inhibitors (leupeptin, 1 μg/ml; aprotinin, 10 μg/ml; pepstatin, 1 μg/ml; benzamidine, 1 mm; dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm; and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm) were added to all buffers. The final extract was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration of each extract was determined using an assay kit from Bio-Rad. Protein concentrations were between 5 and 10 mg/ml. Binding reactions were set on ice in buffer containing 10% glycerol, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Each reaction contained 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma- Aldrich), 5.0 μg of denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 10 μg of liver nuclear proteins. Cold competitors when needed were added at 200-fold molar excess unless otherwise indicated. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled at the 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP. The probes were purified through a G-50 Sephadex spin column. The labeled probe (50,000 cpm) was added, and the binding reaction was incubated on ice for 30 min. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −70 °C using intensifying screens. For supershift analysis, 3 μl of pre-immune or polyclonal antiserum raised against NF-I/CTF (gift from Prof. N. Tanese, New York University, New York, NY) was added to the binding reaction and kept overnight at 4 °C. The probe was then added, and the reaction mixture was kept on ice for an additional 30 min before resolving it on a polyacrylamide gel as above. Mouse L cells (a gift from Prof. D. Linzer, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cultured cells were grown in six-well plates and transfected with 5 μg of the reporter vector at ∼50% confluence using Superfect (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The constructs tested were the empty β-gal basic vector, pbasic, and β-gal basic vector with 430 bp of wild-type mouse ldhc promoter, pWT. Other constructs included those with mutations in the 430-bp promoter, pMutBC, pMutGH, and pMutI. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the Galacto-Plus kit from Tropix (Foster City, CA) and a luminometer. The plasmid pRLTK (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiencies. β-Galactosidase activities are expressed as -fold difference compared with those obtained with the wild-type promoter, pWT. For co-transfection assays, mouse L cells were cultured as above. Cells were transfected at ∼50% confluence in 12-well plates with 2 μg of the reporter plasmids pWT or pMutBC and the expression vectors (1 μg) for NF-I or for CCAAT displacement protein, CDP. The empty vectors, pCH and pMT2, for NF-I and CDP, respectively, were also transfected (1 μg each) in parallel. The internal control pRLTK was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. Cells were harvested 48 h later and lysed. β-Galactosidase activities were determined as above. The β-gal activity of pWT or pMutBC co-transfected with either pCH or pMT2 was arbitrarily set at 100. All other activities are expressed as a percentage of this activity. Binding reactions were carried out as described for EMSA except that the reaction was scaled up 5 times. The probes used were the consensus NF-I element, oligo II, oligo A, and oligo C. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the tubes were exposed to short wavelength UV light for 1 h. The reactions were then boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was dried and exposed overnight to x-ray film at −70 °C. Liver nuclear extracts from adult mice (150 μg of protein) and testis nuclear extracts from adult and 10-day mice (150 μg of protein each) were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the proteins were incubated with anti-NF-I serum for 3 h at room temperature. The blot was washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Proteins were detected using the chemiluminescent ECL system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Mouse L cells transfected with expression vectors for NF-IA, -B, -C, or -X were pelleted, lysed directly in 1× Laemmli buffer, boiled for 10 min, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, the blot was hybridized with 2 μg/ml C125A antibody to HA (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EMSA was used to demonstrate protein binding to specific domains of the mldhcgene. Fig. 1 A shows the sequence of the 430-bp mouse ldhc promoter and the location of the palindrome (inverted arrows), which overlaps the TATA box and includes the transcription initiation site (indicated by an asterisk). Previous studies revealed that the palindrome bound a 65-kDa protein from liver nuclear extracts (2Zhou W. Xu J. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).In vitro transcription assays demonstrated that mutations in the 5′ region of the palindrome resulted in low activity with liver nuclear extract in what otherwise would be a silent mldhcpromoter (4Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We decided to determine first if the entire 31-bp palindrome was necessary for protein binding. Three deletion constructs, each 21 bp in length (oligo I (−21 to −1), oligo II (−16 to +5), and oligo III (−11 to +10)) were generated. EMSA results are seen in Fig. 1 B. The wild-type 31-bp palindrome (P) showed multiple protein complexes (lane 2). Oligo I (lane 3) and oligo III (lane 5) bound very little protein, but oligo II retained protein binding capacity similar to the wild-type 31-bp palindrome (lane 4). These results were confirmed by cross-competition (Fig. 1 B). Oligo II competed for protein binding to the palindrome (lane 10), but oligos I and III did not (lanes 9 and11). Oligo II binds protein even though it lacks the first four nucleotides (ATAA) and the last four nucleotides (TTAT) of the 31-bp palindrome. Oligo I, which lacks the CAACA nucleotides present in oligo II, does not bind protein. Similarly, oligo III lacks CTGTTG present in oligo II and loses protein binding capacity. These results indicate that the nucleotides CAACA and CTGTTG within the palindrome are essential for an electrophoretic mobility shift. Since a gel shift was observed with the 22-bp oligo II, it was used instead of the 31-bp palindrome (P) in subsequent experiments. In order to identify the nucleotides within oligo II required for somatic tissue protein binding, a series of oligos designated oligo A through oligo K were generated by introducing successive 2-bp mutations in oligo II. These oligonucleotides were then used in EMSA with liver nuclear extracts. As seen in Fig.2 A, oligo A shows the same multiple protein complexes (lane 3) that were observed when oligo II was used (lane 2). Oligo A competed for protein binding to oligo II (Fig. 2 B,lane 3). Interestingly, mutation of nucleotides corresponding to sites B, C, and D resulted in a selective loss of the lower mobility bands (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4–6) and oligos B, C, and D could not compete with oligo II for the proteins present in these bands (Fig. 2 B,lanes 4, 5, and 6, respectively). When site E was mutated, only the lowest band was lost (Fig. 2 A,lane 7) and oligo E could not compete for the lowest band (Fig. 2 B, lane 7). The results of EMSA using oligos F–K are shown in Fig. 2 (Cand D). Mutations at sites F, G, and H resulted in a selective loss of the lowest band (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3, 4, and 5, respectively). Oligos G and H could not compete for the lower band (Fig. 2 D,lanes 3 and 4). Oligo F competed weakly for both bands even though, when used as a probe, oligo F did not bind the protein in the lower band (Fig. 2 D,lane 2). This suggests that sites G and H rather than F may be more critical for protein binding. Mutation at the I site led to a loss of both upper bands as well as the lowest band (Fig. 2 C, lane 6). Oligo I competed only weakly for the upper bands (Fig. 2 D,lane 5). Mutations in sites J and K did not affect binding of proteins in the lowest band (Fig. 2 C,lanes 7 and 8). This was confirmed by competition (Fig. 2 D, lanes 6 and7). The above results indicate that there are probably two different proteins that bind the palindrome. One of these binds at sites B, C, and D and also requires an intact site I. The binding of this protein results in multiple protein complexes. The second protein binds at sites E, F, G, H, and I, resulting in a single band, which runs with the highest mobility in EMSA. The requirement of site I for binding both proteins indicates a possible cooperation between the two, whereby the binding of each is enhanced in the presence of the other. After delineation of the two protein binding sites in the palindrome, we wanted to identify the protein binding to the BCD and EFGH sites. A search of the transcription factor data base, Transfac (GBH), resulted in identification of the BCD site, the nucleotide sequence GTTGGC, as a putative NF-I/CTF protein binding site. Competition gel-shift assays tested NF-I binding to this site. As seen in Fig. 3 A, the wild-type palindrome oligo II forms multiple protein complexes with liver nuclear extract (lane 1). A 200-fold excess of the same oligo competed for all the bands (lane 2). The adenoviral NF-I element competes only for the upper bands at 200-fold molar excess (lane 3). The fastest migrating band was not competed, even with an 800-fold excess of the adenoviral NF-I element (data not shown). The mutated NF-I oligonucleotides, NF-I* (CCA to TAA, which disrupts the 3′-half of the NF-I binding site) did not compete with oligo II (Fig. 3 A,lane 4) and NF-I** (TGG to ATT, which disrupts the 5′- half of the NF-I binding site) competed slightly (lane 6). An unrelated consensus sequence for the transcription factor Sp1 did not compete (lane 5). We also assayed a variety of other transcription factor consensus elements such as those for the closely related CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein C/EBP, NF-Y (another CAATT-binding protein), glucocorticoid receptor, and androgen receptor for their ability to compete with oligo II (data not shown). Since none of these elements competed, the specificity of protein binding to the palindrome was confirmed. Additional evidence for the NF-I binding was obtained using the adenoviral NF-I oligonucleotide as probe and either the wild-type or mutated palindrome as competitor. As seen in Fig. 3 A(lane 7), the adenoviral NF-I element bound the same broad band of proteins with similar mobility as the upper bands obtained with oligo II and liver nuclear extract. Oligo II as well as oligo A (mutated palindrome, which retains protein binding capacity; see Fig. 2 A, lane 3) could compete out the proteins from the NF-I element (Fig. 3 A,lanes 8 and 9 at 200- and 400-fold molar excess and lanes 12 and 13 at 200- and 400-fold molar excess). However, oligo C (mutated palindrome, which was unable to bind the upper bands; see Fig. 2 A,lane 4) did not compete (Fig. 3 A,lanes 14 and 15 at 200- and 400-fold molar excess). The NF-I self oligo competed efficiently at 200- and 400-fold excess (Fig. 3 A, lanes 10 and11). These results further demonstrate the similarity of proteins binding to the adenoviral NF-I element and the palindromic oligo II. Further verification of NF-I protein binding to the palindrome was provided by a supershift analysis using anti-NF-I serum. As seen in Fig. 3 B, only the immune serum (lane 2) but not the pre-immune serum (lane 1) could shift protein binding. If the proteins binding to the adenoviral NF-I oligo and themldhc palindrome are the same, then their size should be similar. This was examined by UV cross-linking. As seen in Fig.3 C, the adenoviral NF-I element showed multiple bands (lane 2). This was expected, as there are multiple NF-I isoforms ranging from 35 to 66 kDa in somatic tissues (6Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). However, the size of the proteins cross-linked to the adenoviral NF-I element ranged from 60 to 80 kDa (lane 2). The larger size observed by us could be due to the oligo protein complex, which would increase the size by ∼15–20 kDa. As seen inlane 1, the size of the proteins binding to the palindrome was approximately the same as that for the NF-I consensus oligo. The negative controls were oligo C (lane 3) and oligo III (lane 4) (see Figs.2 A (lane 4) and 1B(lane 5)). As noted above, Southwestern analysis (2Zhou W. Xu J. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 51: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) revealed binding of a 65-kDa protein present in liver nuclear extracts. This finding was confirmed by the UV cross-linking results. A Transfac data base search conducted to identify potential transcription factors that might recognize the nucleotide sequence TCCTGGACCC (corresponding to the EFGHI site) was not informative. The demonstration of protein binding elements in a promoter has meaning only if substantiated in a functional assay. The relevance of the BC, GH, and I protein binding sites in the palindrome was examined by analysis of promoter-reporter constructs including the 430-bp wild-type mouse ldhc promoter, pWT, as well as reporter vectors carrying mutations in the BC (pMutBC), GH (pMutGH), or the I (pMutI) sites in the palindrome. Each of these fragments was cloned upstream of the β-galactosidase reporter in the pb-gal basic vector, and tested for promoter activity in transiently transfected mouse L cells. As seen in Fig. 4 mutation of the BC site led to a 3–4-fold increase in activity compared with the wild-type promoter. Mutation at the GH site, however, had no effect, whereas mutation at the I site resulted in a 2-fold increase in promoter activity over the control. These results indicate that the BC as well as the I sites but not the GH site in the palindromic element of the mldhc promoter function as negative regulatory regions for mouse ldhc gene expression. We have identified an NF-I protein binding site in the palindrome and demonstrated that mutation of this site leads to an increase in promoter activity. In order to investigate whether NF-I functions in silencing this gene, we examined the effects of overexpression of NF-I on mldhc promoter activity. Expression vectors for NF-IA, -B, -C, or -X were co-transfected with the 430-bp mldhc promoter-reporter plasmid into mouse L cells. Overexpression of NF-IA resulted in a slight decrease in promoter activity (Fig. 5 A) compared with control cells transfected with the empty vector, pCH. A Western blot probed with antibody to HA confirmed transfection of these cells with each of the NF-I isoforms (Fig. 5 B). Overexpression of NF-I B, -C, and -X resulted in a statistically significant 40–50% reduction in transcriptional activity (p < 0.001, Student's t test). In order to determine whether repression due to NF-I involves the BC site in the palindrome, we tested overexpression of NF-IB and -C on the activity of pMutBC (430-bp promoter with a mutated BC site in the palindrome). Neither NF-IB nor NF-IC repressed the activity of pMutBC. These results suggest that the NF-I binding site BC is important for repression and that NF-I acts through this site to negatively regulatemldhc transcription. The specificity of NF-I repression was confirmed by overexpressing CDP. We chose this protein because CDP binds close to CAAT boxes and negatively regulates testis-specific genes (7Barberi A. Superti-Furga G. Busslinger M. Cell. 1987; 50: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 8Higgy N.A. Tarnasky H.A. Valarche I. Nepvue A. van der Hoorn F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since the NFI protein is a CCAAT box protein, we wanted to eliminate the possibility that CDP was involved in mldhc regulation. Neither the empty vector pMT2 nor the CDP expression vector pMT2CDP repressed the wild-type mouse ldhc promoter. In fact there was an increase in activity with the CDP expression vector. The binding element for CDP is not well defined, and a Transfac search did not reveal any sites for CDP in the mldhc promoter sequence. Although increased transcriptional activity with CDP is interesting, the important point from these results is that the repression of the mldhcpromoter by NF-I is specific. With a role demonstrated for NF-I proteins in silencing the mldhc gene in somatic tissues, it became of interest to compare NF-I protein levels between testicular and somatic tissues. A Western blot using equal amounts of liver and testis nuclear extracts was resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel and probed with polyclonal anti-NF-I serum. As seen in Fig. 6 liver nuclear extracts from adult mice had abundant NF-I proteins ranging from 50 to 60 kDa. Testis nuclear extracts from adult mice had extremely low levels of NF-I proteins of ∼70 kDa. The level of NF-I appeared to be slightly higher in day 10 mouse testis as compared with adult testis. Previous studies from our laboratory implicated a palindrome sequence between the TATA and transcription start site in repression of the mouse ldhc gene. We have investigated further the role of this palindrome in transcriptional regulation. We first defined the nucleotides important for protein binding. Two sites (GTTGGC, site BCD; and TCCTGGAC, site EFGH) bound protein in gel shift assays. An intact CC dinucleotide (site I), which is 8 nucleotides downstream of GTTGGC, was also needed for protein binding. The protein binding to GTTGGC was identified as the NF-I/CCAAT transcription factor based on competition in EMSA, supershift with anti-NF-I antibody, and UV cross-linking. The consensus binding site for NF-I proteins is TTGG(N7)CCAA. However, in the mldhc palindrome, the TTGG is separated by 8 nucleotides from CCCAA. The spacing between TGG and CCA in the NF-I binding element is thought to be important (9Gronostajski R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5545-5559Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that there are subtle differences in protein binding site requirements not yet defined for the different NF-I isoforms. Our results clearly indicate the ability of NF-I protein to bind the palindrome. We next asked whether these sites function as negative regulatory elements by testing the effect of mutations introduced at the BC, GH, and I sites on promoter activity in transient transfections of mouse L cells. Mutation of the BC site led to a 4-fold increase in promoter activity compared with the wild-type promoter, indicating a functional role in ldhc repression. Mutation of the GH site, however, did not change promoter activity. These results are consistent with a previous study from our laboratory demonstrating that mutations in the 5′ region of the palindrome resulted in slight but significant promoter activity in liver nuclear extracts. Mutations in the center of the palindrome had no effect on promoter activity (4Zhou W. Goldberg E. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 54: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An additional proof that the NF-I protein isoforms function in repression of mldhc is the fact that overexpression of NF-IA, -B, -C, or -X decreased promoter activity of the wild-type 430-bp mldhc promoter but did not affect this activity when we mutated the NF-I site. Functional activity was greatest with NF-IC followed by NF-IB and -X, whereas NF-IA was least effective. NF-I transcription factors are encoded in mammals by four genesNf1a, Nf1b, Nf1c, and Nf1x(6Gronostajski R.M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). There are more than 20 isoforms of the multiple genes and their alternatively spliced products. These proteins form homo- and heterodimers, giving rise to further variants. All the proteins share a highly homologous N-terminal DNA-binding domain, but their C-terminal activation domains differ significantly. Both activator and repressor functions for these proteins have been reported. NF-I suppresses transcription of genes encoding the L-type pyruvate kinase (10Cuif M.-H. Poteu A. Kahn A. Vaulout S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13769-13772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (11Crawford D.R. Leahy P. Hu C.Y. Chaudhry A. Gronostajski R. Grossman G. Woods J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) genes. The mechanism by which it represses these genes is not clearly understood. One model suggests direct competition with transactivators for binding at adjacent sites. An example is the repression of the mouse α1(I) collagen promoter by competition with Sp1 for overlapping binding sites (16Nehls M.C. Grapilon M.L. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similarly, competition between NF-I and HNF4 for overlapping binding sites on the rat pyruvate kinase promoter is proposed to play a role in cell-type specific repression by NF-I proteins (17Yamada K. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 917Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminal regions of NF-I proteins can function as repressors when attached to heterologous DNA binding domains (18Osada S. Ikeda T. Xu M. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating that direct repression can occur either through recruitment of co-repressors or interaction with the basal transcription apparatus. The NF-I site in the palindrome is adjacent to the TATA box. One model to explain the mechanism by which NF-I silences the mldhcgene is prevention through steric hindrance, of assembly of the basal transcriptional complex. This is consistent with the demonstration by Chaudhry et al. (19Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dynamics. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) that NF-I mRNA levels for all four NF-I isoforms are high in somatic tissues and extremely low in the testis. In fact, NF-I may not be expressed at all in germ cells, with the low NF-I mRNA level accounted for by somatic cells in the testis. This is supported by our Western blot analysis, which shows higher NF-I levels in 10-day testis (when mostly somatic cells are present) as compared with the adult with a preponderance of germ cells. Testicular tissues have much higher levels of TATA-binding protein (TBP) than somatic tissues (20Schmidtt E.E. Ohbayashi T. Makino Y. Tamura T. Schibler U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5326-5334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A low ratio of NF-I/TBP or a total lack of NF-I in germ cells may favor assembly of the transcriptional complex in testis but not in somatic tissues, which have a high NF-I/TBP ratio. Alternatively, NF-I proteins may negatively regulate the mldhc gene through differences in the NF-I isoforms found in somatic and germ cells. NF-IA mRNA predominates in the testis (19Chaudhry A.Z. Lyons G.E. Gronostajski R.M. Dev. Dynamics. 1997; 208: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and has the lowest repressor activity in transient transfection assays. NF-IB3, was isolated and characterized from a human fibroblast cell line. This isoform is generated by the use of a premature polyadenylation site located in an intron. NF-IB3 lacks a transcriptional activation domain and functions as a repressor by forming heterodimers with NF-IB, -C, and -X isoforms and reducing their DNA binding activity (21Liu Y. Bernard H.-U. Apt D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10739-10745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Truncated isoforms lacking an activation domain may predominate in somatic tissues. Such isoforms would not be detected by the anti-NF-I serum, which was raised against the C-terminal portion of NF-I. A third mechanism for differential gene expression could involve differences in tissue cofactors such that the testis may lack co-repressors needed by NF-I. With the results presented here, the mechanism by which NF-I represses themldhc gene in somatic tissues as well as during the early stages of spermatogenesis can now be elucidated. In the mldhc gene, the palindrome sequence is flanked by a TATA box and the transcription initiation site. Sequences in this region have been described previously as negative regulators of testis-specific genes including the rat sperm H2B gene and the rat H1t genes (22Kim K. Chae C.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15271-15273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Clare S.E. Fantz F.A. Kistler S. Kistler M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33036-33040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In these cases the protein binding these sites was not identified. The rat sperm H2B gene is expressed in meiotic pachytene spermatocytes. Repression in pre-meiotic cells appears to be due to proteins binding at an E element, which lies between the TATA box and the transcription initiation site (22Kim K. Chae C.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15271-15273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On analyzing the E element using the Transfac program, we found that it did contain an NF-I binding site. However, NF-I may not be involved in the repression of this gene in spermatogonia, since the protein binding to the E element is found in testis of 7-day-old rats but not in somatic tissue extracts. The testis-specific histone H1tgene is also expressed only in pachytene spermatocytes. A negative regulatory region designated GC box 2 lies just downstream of the TATA box and plays a major role in gene repression (23Clare S.E. Fantz F.A. Kistler S. Kistler M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33036-33040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Sp1 proteins bind weakly to this element but are not involved in repression of this gene. Observations from these two studies and mldhcregulation suggest that different mechanisms and transcription factors seem to be involved in determining testis-specific gene expression in different species at the same developmental stages of spermatogenesis.

MPs (Mr = 18,500) has an anomalously low electrophoretic mobility, running with an apparent Mr of ∼21,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. CD spectroscopy shows that it is ∼45% α-helix and undergoes a cooperative temperature-induced unfolding with a transition midpoint of 73 °C. Limited proteolysis rapidly degrades MPs to a stable C-terminal fragment (Mr = 10,000) that retains most of the helical content. Rotary shadowing electron microscopy reveals that it is an elongated protein with two domains. Sedimentation velocity measurements show that recombinant MPt (Mr = 107,000), intact MPs, and the 10-kDa MPs fragment are all dimeric, and that MPs and MPt form a complex with a molar mass consistent with a 1:1 heterodimer. Sequence analysis predicts that regions in the C-terminal portions of both MPs and MPt have high probabilities for coiled coil formation. A synthetic peptide from a region of MPs encompassing residues 77–116 was found to be 100% α-helical, dimeric, and formed a complex with MPt with a molecular mass corresponding to a heterodimer. Based on these results, we propose that MPs is an elongated molecule with an N-terminal head and a C-terminal stalk domain. It dimerizes via a coiled coil interaction in the stalk domain, and interacts with MPt via heterodimeric coiled coil formation. Since other proteins with known regulatory function toward MP also have predicted coiled coil regions, our results suggest that these regulatory proteins target MP via the same coiled coil strand exchange mechanism with MPt.

This control is achieved by regulating the activities of myosin light chain kinase and the corresponding phosphatase.

Commun. 1999; 254: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Some properties of MPs have been reported. Two MPs cDNAs have been isolated, one coding for a 161-amino acid (18 kDa) protein (18Zhang Y. Mabuchi K. Tao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 21Zhou Y. Nishimura J. Hirano K. Kanaide H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the other for a 186-amino acid (21 kDa) protein containing a leucine zipper motif (16Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Alessi D.R. Gampbell D.G. Shanahan C. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (abbreviated as MPs(21)). We have shown that the two are isoforms of each other, and that in chicken gizzard the 18-kDa isoform is the predominant species (22Mabuchi K. Gong B.J. Langsetmo K. Ito M. Nakano T. Tao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). MPs and MPt as well were reported to be capable of binding to phospholipids in vitro (23Ito M. Feng J. Tsujino S. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Tanaka J. Ichikawa K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7607-7614Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was also reported to co-localize with microtubules in COS7 cells (24Takizawa N. Schmidt D.J. Tuft R.A. Ikebe M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: A290Google Scholar). Both results suggest a targeting role for MPs. It has been reported that MPs can bind to myosin with a relatively high stoichiometry of 20:1 MPs:myosin (7Johnson D.F. Cohen P. Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When exogenously added to permeabilized porcine renal artery muscle MPs was shown to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, possibly by inhibiting the activity of the endogenous MP(21). Previous studies using qualitative binding assays have provided some information on the regions of MPs and MPt that are involved in binding. Using the gel overlay assay (7Johnson D.F. Cohen P. Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) it was reported that MPs(21) reacts with MPt and MPt fragments that contain the C-terminal 72 residues, suggesting that the MPs interaction site in MPt lies within the latter's last 72 residues. The N-terminal fragment MPs(21)1–146 that lacks the leucine-zipper segment reacted with MPt, indicating that this segment is not necessary for interactions with MPt. Curiously, neither MPs(21)1–110 nor MPs(21)110–186 reacted with the MPt C-terminal fragment. The same study reported that the retention times of MPs(21) and MPs(21)1–146 are anomalously low on a size exclusion column, suggesting that MPs(21) may be a dimer, and that the dimerization site is within residues 1–146. A study using the yeast 2-hybrid assay (25Hirano K. Phan B.C. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3683-3688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that MPs reacts with the C-terminal MPt fragment, MPt512–963, consistent with the gel overlay results described above. The same assay showed that both MPs and this MPt fragment react with themselves, suggesting that both can dimerize. In an effort to understand the function of MPs, we carried out an extensive study on the biophysical properties of recombinant MPs (the 18-kDa isoform), and its interaction with MPt. The results show that both MPs and MPt are dimers, and that they can form a heterodimeric complex. A peptide corresponding to a sequence in MPs with high predicted probability for coiled coil formation was found to mimic MPs with respect to self-dimerization and heterodimeric complexation with MPt. It is proposed that MPs and some of the MP regulatory proteins interact with MPt via coiled coil exchange, a mechanism that may also be relevant in other signal transduction processes. Common reagents and buffer components were from Sigma. HEPES was from Research Organics (Cleveland, OH), reagents for recombinant DNA procedures were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and United States Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH), and chemicals for gel electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad. MP holoenzyme was purified from chicken gizzard by the method of Alessi et al.(4Alessi D. Macdougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) as modified in Mabuchi et al. (22Mabuchi K. Gong B.J. Langsetmo K. Ito M. Nakano T. Tao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). MPt was expressed and purified as described in Zhang et al.(18Zhang Y. Mabuchi K. Tao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). MPs was expressed using a clone isolated from a chicken gizzard cDNA library as described in Zhang et al. (18Zhang Y. Mabuchi K. Tao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The NdeI BamHI fragment containing the coding sequence was subcloned into the corresponding restriction sites ofE. coli expression vector pAED4 (28Doering D.S. Matsudaira P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12677-12685Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) under the control of the T7 phage promoter. This plasmid is referred to as pKLMPs. Expression was in KS1000(DE3), with the T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the lac promoter. The KS1000(DE3) strain was derived from the tsp protease-deficient strain KS1000 (29Silber K.R. Sauer R.T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A stable DE3 λ lysogen was produced using the λDE3 Lysogenization Kit (Novagen, Madison, WI). Cells containing the pKLMPs plasmid were grown at 37 °C in TB (30Tartof K.D. Hobbs C.A. Focus (Life Technologies). 1987; 9: 12Google Scholar). Expression was induced when the culture reached an A600 ∼ 0.5 by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After induction, the cells were grown for an additional 3 h, harvested by centrifugation, and then frozen and stored at −80 °C. The cells were disrupted by sonication in buffer A (50 mmTris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin, and benzamidine), followed by the addition of polyethyleneimine to a concentration of 0.1%. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was applied to a DE52 (Whatman) column in buffer A to remove contaminating nucleic acids and a large fraction of E. coli proteins. The flow-through was collected and applied to a S-Sepharose column, and eluted in buffer A with a gradient of 0 to 500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing MPs were combined and applied to an Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) column, and eluted with a gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically using molar extinction coefficients calculated from the number of Tyr and Trp residues using the program Lasergene (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The following values were used (in units of m−1cm−1): E280 = 6,400 for MPs, 2,560 for the 10.3-kDa chymotryptic fragment MPs75–161 and the synthetic peptide MPs77–116, andE280 = 73,240 for MPt. Protein molecular masses were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry using a Perceptive Biosystems VoyagerTM Elite mass spectrometer (Framingham, MA). Peptide synthesis was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 431A Peptide Synthesizer using rink (amide) resin. N-terminal sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 477A Protein Sequencer. Aliquots of MPs were prepared for enzymatic degradation by dialysis into 25 mm Tris, 0.1m NaCl, pH 7.5. Chymotrypsin (Sigma) was added at a 1:1000 (w/w) dilution. The mixture was held on ice for 1.5 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The MPs75–161 fraction was purified by chromatography on Mono-S (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Recombinant MPs was diluted from a stock solution to 20 μg/ml in a solution containing 0.1 mammonium acetate and 30% glycerol, pH 7.2, and sprayed onto a surface of freshly cleaved mica for visualization by the rotary shadowing method described previously (31Mabuchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 103: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Specimens were observed with a Philips 300 electron microscope operating at 60 kV. This was carried out in buffer A on a 62A DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates, Lakewood NJ) equipped with an automatic temperature controller. Sedimentation velocity data was collected on a Beckman XLI analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples were exchanged into buffer A by gel filtration on PD10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were placed into double sector interference cells with buffer A as the reference. Centrifugation was at 50,000 rpm for 4 h. Data were analyzed by the time derivative method as described in detail by Stafford (32Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Briefly, by taking the average of the difference between pairs of fringe displacement data, time independent background signal variations can effectively be filtered out. From this, the apparent sedimentation coefficient distribution function, g(s*) could be obtained. It has been shown that for a single homogeneous species, g(s*) is essentially a Gaussian with an area that is proportional to the concentration of the material (32Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 33Stafford W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 478-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and a variance that is related to the translational diffusion coefficient D (34). Thus from a plot ofg(s*) versus s* (referred to as the time-derivative plot) the sedimentation coefficient, s, andD can be obtained from the peak position, and the width, respectively, of the Gaussian. From these quantities, the molar mass,M, and the frictional coefficient, f, can be calculated from the Svedberg equation (cf. Tanford (35Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1961Google Scholar)). Sedimentation equilibrium data were collected on a Beckman XLA analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples of the MPs77–116peptide were exchanged into 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, by gel filtration on PD10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples containing 0.1 mm MPs77–116 were placed into double sector cells with 50 mm potassium phosphate as the reference, and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm, 20 °C for 4 days. Data were collected using absorbance at 230 nm. The electrophoretic mobility of recombinant MPs on SDS-PAGE is identical to that of MPs from the MP holoenzyme purified from chicken gizzards (Fig.1, lanes 2 and 1). From a plot of the standards mobilities versus the logarithm of their molecular masses, recombinant MPs was determined to have an anomalously low electrophoretic mobility corresponding to a molecular mass of 21 kDa (data not shown). This value is in agreement with that previously reported for chicken gizzard MPs (4Alessi D. Macdougall L.K. Sola M.M. Ikebe M. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1023-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The molecular mass determined by mass spectrometry was 18.5 kDa, in agreement with the expected molecular mass derived from the amino acid sequence (18.4 kDa). Sequential Edman degradation yielded the expected N-terminal sequence of MPs. The stability of recombinant MPs to proteolytic digestion was examined by subjecting it to limited chymotrypsin digestion. We found that it was readily digested to a stable fragment (Fig. 1, lane 3). Sequential Edman degradation of this fragment yielded an N-terminal amino acid sequence of SSRAEEESNR, corresponding to residues 75–84 of MPs. The molecular mass of this fragment determined by mass spectrometry is 10.2 kDa, in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of a fragment, MPs75–161, extending from residue 75 to the C terminus (10.3 kDa). We conclude that MPs has a protease-sensitive and a protease-resistant domain in its N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. The images of our bacteria expressed MPs may be explained by assuming a “mushroom” shape, with a globular head portion and a short tail (Fig.2). This suggests that the recombinant protein folds into a single conformation of a relatively uniform two-domain structure. Out of 25 images analyzed, the dimensions of the images are 15.5 ± 1.5 nm for the total length, 7.6 ± 1.0 nm for the length of the tail, and 9.8 ± 1.1 nm for the width of the head. The actual dimensions of the molecule are likely to be ∼1.5 nm smaller when the thickness of the metal was taken into account. The molecule is likely to be a dimer (Mr = 36,000) rather than a monomer (Mr = 18,000) by comparison with monomeric G-actin (Mr = 42,000), assuming that the amount of metal associated with each molecule is proportional to their sizes. The secondary structure of MPs was characterized by circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry. The CD spectrum of MPs taken from 260 to 200 nm show a strong α-helical signal, with peaks of negative ellipiticity at 222 and 208 nm characteristic of α-helical structure (Fig.3). Analysis of the CD spectrum of MPs by comparison to the spectra of 35 proteins of known structure using the program VARSELEC (36Hennessey Jr., J.P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1085-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) indicates MPs is 45% α-helical (TableI). Following the change in ellipiticity at 222 nm with increasing temperature, MPs shows a single cooperative temperature induced unfolding transition, with a relatively high midpoint of 73 °C (data not shown). The CD spectrum of MPs75–161 contains the same negative ellipiticity due to α-helical secondary structure found with MPs, but with a higher α-helical content of 55%. Sequence analysis using the method of Berger et al. (37Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) revealed a C-terminal MPs region, residues 75–135, that has a probability of 100% for coiled coil formation. A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues within this region, MPs77–116, has a CD spectrum that when analyzed with VARSELEC yielded an α-helix content of 100%.Table IMolecular Properties of MPt, MPs, MPs-derived fragments and their complexesMaterialHelixTms20,wDMoMf/f0%°CSvedbergFickkDakg · mol−1MPt22496.1 ± 0.22.5 ± 0.1107219 ± 122.1MPs45731.85 ± 0.055.4 ± 0.418.536.4 ± 32.1MPs75–16155721.35 ± 0.15.6 ± 0.510.321.6 ± 22.0MPs77–11610077ND1-aND, not determined.ND4.69.0 ± 0.4NDMPs + MPtNDND4.5 ± 0.32.8 ± 0.6126111 ± 192.0MPs77–116 + MPtNDND4.0 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.3112109 ± 92.1Tm is the unfolding transition temperature, determined from a nonlinear least squares fit of the data using a van't Hoff analysis for the unfolding reaction.s20,w and D are the sedimentation coefficient in water at 20 °C and the diffusion coefficient, determined from the position and width of the Gaussian fit in the time derivative plots, respectively.

Mo is the monomer molecular mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. M is the molar mass determined by analytical ultracentrifugation.f/f0 is the frictional ratio, calculated assuming 0.366 g of H2O/g protein hydration. The time derivative plot for MPs revealed a single peak (Fig. 4 A), which when fit by a Gaussian yielded s20,w = 1.85 s and D = 5.4 F, from which the molar mass,M, was calculated to be 36 ± 3 kg mol−1(Table I), corresponding to a dimer. A relatively large frictional ratio f/f0 of 2.1 was calculated, indicating that the molecule is extended. The time derivative plot of MPt (Fig.4 B) was obtained and analyzed similarly, yieldingM = 219 ± 12 kg mol−1 andf/f0 = 2.1 indicating that it too is a dimer and highly elongated. The determined molar masses of the C-terminal fragment MPs75–161 and of the peptide MPs77–116, are such that they too are dimeric, with that of the peptide determined by sedimentation equilibrium because it is too small for sedimentation velocity measurements. Equilibrium binding between MPs and MPt was studied by sedimentation velocity experiments, in which MPs was added to MPt at increasing molar ratios of 0:1, 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 (Fig. 5). The time derivative plot shows the decline of the peak at s* ≈ 5.6 corresponding to MPt and the appearance and growth of a new peak at s* ≈ 4.2 between the MPt and MPs peaks, suggesting the production of a new species with a molar mass between that of dimeric MPs and MPt. The molar mass of this product was estimated by fitting the time derivative plot with three Gaussians simultaneously. Four separate experiments at various MPs:MPt molar ratios yielded M = 111 ± 19 kg mol−1. Note that the standard deviation for this determination is relatively large because of the higher uncertainty incurred when attempting to fit to three Gaussians. The interaction between the MPs77–116 peptide and MPt was also studied by velocity sedimentation. The results show that a complex ofM = 109 kg mol−1 is formed (Table I), consistent with a complex containing one MPt polypeptide chain. Our proteolysis result suggests that MPs has two domains, an N-terminal protease susceptible domain and a C-terminal protease-resistant one, possibly corresponding to the head and stalk domains, respectively, seen in the electron micrographs. Our sedimentation velocity results show that MPs is elongated and dimeric. The latter accounts for the observation that MPs elutes faster than MPc (Mr = 37,000) in gel filtration (7Johnson D.F. Cohen P. Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). From its CD spectrum we estimated that 72 of the 161 residues in MPs are α-helical. The protease-resistant fragment MPs75–161 is also dimeric and retains a large proportion (67%) of the helical residues in MPs. Owing to its high α-helix content, its dimeric structure and high Tm , we suspected that coiled coil interactions might be involved in the dimerization of MPs. When we analyzed its sequence with the program Paircoil (37Berger B. Wilson D.B. Wolf E. Tonchev T. Milla M. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8259-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), which predicts the propensity of internal sequences to be engaged in coiled coil interactions, we found that residues 75–135 of MPs have a 100% probability of engaging in coiled coil interaction. We then synthesized a peptide, which contains ∼6 heptad repeats within this putative MPs coiled coil region. Our results show that this peptide is 100% α-helical, has a high Tm = 77 °C and dimeric, all characteristics of a coiled coil. Taken together, we propose that MPs is an elongated dimeric protein with an N-terminal head domain (residues 1–74) on each chain, and a C-terminal stalk domain (residues 75–161) that contains a coiled coil region spanning residues 75–135. This proposed dimeric structure is compatible with results derived from previous qualitative studies by gel filtration (7Johnson D.F. Cohen P. Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or yeast two-hybrid assay (25Hirano K. Phan B.C. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3683-3688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Our results show that MPt is also a dimer, as suggested by earlier electron microscopy (22Mabuchi K. Gong B.J. Langsetmo K. Ito M. Nakano T. Tao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and yeast two-hybrid (25Hirano K. Phan B.C. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3683-3688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) results. It is highly elongated, also compatible with the rotary shadowing electron microscopic images of MPt (22Mabuchi K. Gong B.J. Langsetmo K. Ito M. Nakano T. Tao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Paircoil analysis reveals that residues 674–705 and 888–928 have probabilities of 60 and 81% for coiled coil formation, raising the possibility that MPt also dimerizes via coiled coil interaction. The appearance of a new peak between the MPs and MPt peaks in the time derivative plot clearly show that a complex is formed when MPs is added to MPt. The molecular mass of this complex was estimated to be 111 ± 19 kg mol−1. In comparison with the theoretical molecular masses of a 1:1 and 2:1 MPs·MPt complex (125.5 and 144 kg mol−1, respectively), our determined value is closer to the former value. Thus, despite the large uncertainty in this measurement, we believe that our data is more compatible with a 1:1 heterodimeric MPs·MPt complex. We surmised that the region in MPs that is engaged in this interaction is the coiled coil region of the C-terminal fragment, residues 75–135. To test this notion, we added the MPs77–116 peptide to MPt. Sedimentation velocity experiments clearly show that it forms a complex containing one MPt polypeptide chain, consistent with our proposal that residues 75–135 of MPs is the MPt complexation site in MPs. We noted that this proposal is consistent with published gel-overlay results (7Johnson D.F. Cohen P. Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus their finding that deletion of residues 147–186 of MPs (21Zhou Y. Nishimura J. Hirano K. Kanaide H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 158-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) had no effect on its binding to MPt can be expected since the coiled coil region, residues 75–135 was left intact in the MPs(21)1–146fragment. Their finding that neither MPs(21)1–110 nor MPs(21)110–186 could bind MPt is most likely because residue 110 is near the center of the 75–135 coiled coil sequence, and that the shortened coiled coil regions (residues 75–110 and 110–135) are not long enough to interact with MPt. The site of interaction in MPt is not yet known, although sequence analysis suggests that it too contains potential coiled coil-forming regions. It seems likely that MPs and MPt forms a heterodimer via coiled coil exchange from the homodimers. It is interesting to note that four putative regulatory proteins of MP, Rho-associated kinase (38Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Fujita A. Watanabe N. Saito Y. Kakizuka A. Morii N. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), cGMP-dependent kinase (14Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), all contain predicted coiled coil regions. Indeed, a qualitative study using affinity chromatography and yeast two-hybrid assay had suggested that the cGMP-dependent kinase interacts with MPt via coiled coil interaction (14Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that MP is targeted by its regulatory partners by coiled coil strand exchange. This could occur via changes in local concentration or modulation of relative affinities. Coiled coil interactions have been suggested as important in other regulatory systems such as the signal transduction and activator of transcription (Stat) gene family (41Paulson M. Pisharody S.

https://openalex.org/W1996864187,"We found recently that β-lactamase folds in the yeast cytosol to a native-like, catalytically active, and trypsin-resistant conformation, and is thereafter translocated into the ER and secreted to the medium. Previously, it was thought that pre-folded proteins cannot be translocated. Here we have studied in living yeast cells whether β-lactamase, a tight globule in authentic form, must be unfolded for ER translocation. A β-lactamase mutant (E166A) binds irreversibly benzylpenicillin via Ser70in the active site. We fused E166A to the C terminus of a yeast-derived polypeptide having a post-translational signal peptide. In the presence of benzylpenicillin, the E166A fusion protein was not translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas translocation of the unmutated variant was not affected. The benzylpenicillin-bound protein adhered to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where it prevented translocation of BiP, carboxypeptidase Y, and secretory proteins. Although the 321-amino acid-long N-terminal fusion partner adopts no regular secondary structure and should have no constraints for pore penetration, the benzylpenicillin-bound protein remained fully exposed to the cytosol, maintaining its signal peptide. Our data suggest that the β-lactamase portion must unfold for translocation, that the unfolding machinery is cytosolic, and that unfolding of the remote C-terminal β-lactamase is required for initiation of pore penetration."
https://openalex.org/W2142175567,"Abstract The C terminus of the catalytic γ subunit of phosphorylase kinase contains two autoinhibitory calmodulin binding domains designated PhK13 and PhK5. These peptides inhibit truncated γ(1-300). Previous data show that PhK13 (residues 302–326) is a competitive inhibitor with respect to phosphorylase b, with a K i of 1.8 μm (1). This result suggests that PhK13 may bind to the active site of truncated γ(1-300). Variants of PhK13 were prepared to localize the determinants for interaction with the catalytic fragment γ(1-300). PhK13-1, containing residues 302–312, was found to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to phosphorylase b with aK i of 6.0 μm. PhK13 has been proposed to function as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor with Cys-308 occupying the site that normally accommodates the phosphorylatable serine in phosphorylase b. A PhK13-1 variant, C308S, was synthesized. Kinetic characterization of this peptide reveals that it does not serve as a substrate but is a competitive inhibitor. Additional variants were designed based on previous knowledge of phosphorylase kinase substrate determinants. Variants were analyzed as substrates and as inhibitors for truncated γ(1-300). Although PhK13-1 does not appear to function as a pseudosubstrate, several specificity determinants employed in the recognition of phosphorylase bas substrate are utilized in the recognition of PhK13-1 as an inhibitor."
