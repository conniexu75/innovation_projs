https://openalex.org/W2025723633,"Fractionation of HeLa cell extracts reveals the presence of a promoter-specific transcription factor, Sp 1, which activates a class of promoters that includes the SV40 early promoter but not several others that have been tested. We analyzed SV40 early-promoter deletion mutants and determined that transcriptional activation by Sp 1 requires sequences within tandem 21 bp repeats located 70-110 bp upstream of the transcription initiation sites. In a DNAase footprinting assay, Sp 1 protected sequences in this same 21 bp repeat region, thus indicating the presence of a specific site for Sp 1 binding. During purification of Sp 1, there was a correlation between transcription-stimulatory activity and promoter-binding activity. These results suggest that direct binding of Sp 1 to sequences in the upstream promoter element is the mechanism by which this factor activates transcription by RNA polymerase II at the SV40 early promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2006558753,"To study the regulation of the human beta-interferon (beta-IFN) gene by poly(I)-poly(C), we analyzed the expression of deletion mutants of the cloned gene introduced into mouse cells on a new bovine papilloma virus (BPV) vector. In stable cell lines transformed by a BPV-IFN plasmid containing the beta-IFN structural gene with 210 bp of DNA to the 5' side of its mRNA cap site (denoted -210), human beta-IFN mRNA is induced approximately 400-fold by poly(I)-poly(C), and reproducible levels of expression are observed for independent cell lines. Our studies indicate that there are two distinct regulatory regions adjacent to the gene, located between -77 and -19, and between -210 and -107. The -77 to -19 region is required for constitutive and induced IFN gene expression, and both are drastically reduced by deletion to -73. When sequences between -210 and -107 are deleted, the constitutive level of IFN gene expression is increased 5- to 10-fold, while induced expression is essentially unaffected. Deletion of the -210 to -107 region also alters the kinetics of induction of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W2070428634,"The Waxy (Wx) locus in maize determines the amylose content of pollen and endosperm tissue. There are several mutant alleles of the locus caused by insertion of transposable controlling elements. In the present study, we have used the properties of controlling element alleles to identify the Wx locus and its gene product, with the subsequent objective of isolating the elements causing the mutations. We present evidence that the Wx locus encodes a starch granule-bound 58 kd polypeptide that is synthesized in vitro as a 65 kd precursor. We describe the isolation of recombinant plasmids containing cDNA inserts homologous to Wx mRNA and a recombinant lambda phage containing a genomic Eco RI fragment encompassing most or all of the Wx transcription unit. We show that a mutation caused by the controlling element Dissociation (Ds) is attributable to an insertion of approximately 2.4 kb at the Wx locus."
https://openalex.org/W2102726352,"Restriction endonuclease fragments containing part of the Waxy (Wx) locus have been cloned from strains with insertion mutations at the locus caused by the controlling elements Activator (Ac) and Dissociation (Ds). Evidence is presented that the genetically defined Ac element corresponds to a 4.3 kb insertion, while the two Ds elements correspond to 4.1 kb and 2.0 kb insertions, all near the 3' end of the Wx transcription unit. The 4.1 kb Ds is almost completely homologous to the Ac element, differing by a central deletion of less than 0.2 kb. The 2.0 kb Ds element is homologous to the ends of the Ac element. Sequences homologous to the ends of the Ac element are present in many copies in the genomes examined, while there are ten or fewer copies of a sequence with homology to the center of the cloned Ac element. The Ac element at the Wx locus can be distinguished structurally from the other Ac-like sequences in the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1968215478,"When the human beta-globin gene is transfected into Hela cells, no beta-globin RNA is detected unless the gene is linked to a viral transcription enhancer. In this paper we show that trans-acting adenovirus and herpesvirus (pseudorabies) transcriptional regulatory proteins can circumvent this enhancer requirement for detectable beta-globin transcription in transient expression assays. The viral gene products can be provided by constitutively expressed, integrated viral genes in established cell lines, by viral infection of permissive cells, or by transfection of cells with bacterial plasmids carrying the viral immediate-early genes. These results demonstrate the utility of transient expression assays for studying regulatory mechanisms involving trans-acting factors. Analysis of beta-globin promoter mutants indicates that between 75 and 128 bp of sequence 5' to the mRNA cap site is required for enhancer-dependent transcription in Hela cells. In contrast, beta-globin transcription in the presence of viral immediate-early gene products requires only 36 bp of 5'-flanking sequence, which includes the TATA box. Thus both cis and trans-acting viral factors activate beta-globin gene transcription in transient expression experiments, but the mechanisms by which they act appear to be fundamentally different."
https://openalex.org/W2054385006,"Using transferrin peroxidase (Tfn-HRP) and a transferrin receptor-specific antibody complexed to colloidal gold (ATR) we have identified the intracellular compartments concerned with processing internalized transferrin-receptor complexes. We have identified major membrane-bound systems in the peripheral cytoplasm and in the juxtanuclear area, from which components of these complexes are returned to the cell surface. Time course studies indicate that the peripheral system is concerned with a ""short circuit,"" recycling ligand and receptor complexes back to the upper surface of the cell. The juxtanuclear compartment is part of a longer circuit that routes some receptors to the basal surface and others, along with ligand, to the lysosome."
https://openalex.org/W2122078632,"We have detected two site-specific endonucleases in strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One endonuclease, which we call YZ endo, is present only in yeast strains that are undergoing mating-type interconversion. The site at which YZ endo cleaves corresponds to the in vivo double-strand break occurring at the mating-type locus in yeast undergoing mating-type interconversion. YZ endo generates a site-specific double-strand break having 4-base 3' extensions terminating in 3' hydroxyl groups. The site of cleavage occurs in the Z1 region near the YZ junction of the mating-type locus. Mutant mating-type loci known to decrease the frequency of mating-type interconversion are correspondingly poor substrates for YZ endo in vitro. In vitro analysis of a number of such altered recognition sites has delimited the sequences required for cleavage. The molecular genetics of mating-type interconversion is discussed in the context of this endonucleolytic activity. The second endonuclease, which we refer to as Sce II, is present in all strains of S. cerevisiae we have examined. The cleavage site of Sce II has been determined and proves to be unrelated to the cleavage site of YZ endo."
https://openalex.org/W2068817943,"We have prepared an antiserum against a synthetic dodecapeptide whose sequence corresponds to the C terminus of the MC29 v-myc protein. This antiserum (anti-v-myc 12C) specifically precipitates the known gag-myc fusion proteins produced by the defective leukemia viruses MC29, CMII, and OK10, but does not react with gag-precursor or product proteins. In addition, proteins of 62 kd and 61/63 kd are precipitated by anti-v-myc 12C from OK10 and MH2 transformants, respectively. The serum also recognizes comigrating 62 kd proteins from three chicken bursal lymphoma cell lines and from the products of in vitro translation of c-myc-specific mRNA. All of these myc-related proteins are phosphorylated and all appear to be localized in the cell nucleus. In uninfected quail cells, anti-v-myc 12C also recognizes a candidate c-myc protein of 60 kd, which does not appear to be phosphorylated and is present in low levels relative to v-myc and lymphoma c-myc proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2081760497,"The single gene Le1, coding for soybean seed lectin, was compared to le1, a naturally occurring mutant allele containing a 3.4 kb insertion within its coding region. Le1 is devoid of introns and produces a 1.0 kb mRNA. It codes for a signal sequence of 32 amino acids and a mature protein of 253 amino acids. With the exception of six single-base substitutions, the coding and flanking sequences in le1 are identical with those in the uninterrupted gene. The insertion termini are imperfect inverted repeats flanked by a 3 bp duplication of lectin target DNA. Inverted repeats within the lectin gene are located symmetrically with respect to the insertion site and are homologous to a region of the insertion termini. These molecular traits conform with the structural aspects of transposable elements in other organisms and imply some degree of site specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2010675102,"A plasmid containing the adenovirus E2 gene, a gene normally requiring E1A-mediated induction during viral infection, is expressed very poorly upon transfection into mouse L cells. If the same plasmid is transfected into 293 cells, which constitutively express the adenovirus E1A gene, or into L cells together with a plasmid containing the E1A gene, the E2 gene is expressed at higher levels. Cotransfection of the E2 plasmid with a plasmid containing the pseudorabies virus (a herpesvirus) immediate early gene results in an even higher increase in the level of E2 expression. In addition, efficient E2 expression in the absence of trans induction was obtained by inserting E1A upstream promoter sequences at the 5' or 3' end of the E2 gene, indicating that these E1A sequences possess enhancer properties. Thus the efficient expression of the E2 gene can be obtained either by a structural change in the gene itself or by a trans-acting induction."
https://openalex.org/W1886532383,"Human skin fibroblasts maintained in cell culture secrete a collagenase inhibitor which has been purified to homogeneity from serum-containing culture medium using a combination of salt precipitation, and ion-exchange, phenylboronate-agarose, gel filtration, and high pressure liquid chromatography. The pure inhibitor retained full activity and exhibited a 1:1 molar inhibition of collagenase. A single band of Mr = 28,500 was seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amino acid composition was remarkable for the presence of 24 half-cystine residues. No free sulfhydryls were present and the resultant 12 disulfide bridges may account for the remarkable stability of this protein to extremes of pH, temperature, pressure, as well as to denaturing agents. A total of 13 hexose residues/molecule were found. NH2-terminal sequence analysis revealed the presence of a single polypeptide chain and the first 23 residues were identified. A monospecific antibody was produced which abolished the functional activity of the inhibitor. Fibroblast inhibitor was found to migrate with the beta-globulins by immunoelectrophoresis. A chromatographically and immunologically identical collagenase inhibitor was partially purified from human serum, suggesting the possibility that the fibroblast-derived inhibitor and the previously reported serum beta 1-anticollagenase (Woolley, D. E., Roberts, D. R., and Evanson, J. M., (1975) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 66, 747-754) are similar, if not identical, proteins. The fibroblast collagenase inhibitor was found to be clearly distinct from other collagenase inhibitors of leukocyte and serum origin."
https://openalex.org/W134453782,"To identify the domain of apolipoprotein E (apo-E) involved in binding to low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors on cultured human fibroblasts, apo-E was cleaved and the fragments were tested for receptor binding activity. Two large thrombolytic peptides (residues 1-191 and 216-299) of normal apo-E3 were combined with the phospholipid dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and tested for their ability to compete with 125I-LDL for binding to the LDL (apo-B,E) receptors on human fibroblasts. The NH2-terminal two-thirds (residues 1-191) of apo-E3 was as active as intact apo-E3 . DMPC, while the smaller peptide (residues 216-299) was devoid of receptor-binding activity. When apo-E3 was digested with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) and the four largest CNBr fragments were combined with DMPC and tested, only one fragment competed with 125I-LDL for binding to cultured human fibroblasts (CNBr II, residues 126-218). This fragment possessed binding activity similar to that of human LDL. The 125I-labeled CNBr II . DMPC complex also demonstrated high affinity, calcium-dependent saturable binding to solubilized bovine adrenal membranes. The binding of CNBr II . DMPC was inhibited by 1,2-cyclohexanedione modification of arginyl residues or diketene modification of lysyl residues. In addition, the CNBr II had to be combined with DMPC before it demonstrated any receptor-binding activity. Pronase treatment of the membranes abolished the ability of this fragment to bind to the apo-B,E receptors. This same basic region in the center of the molecule has been implicated as the apo-B,E receptor-binding domain not only by this study but also by other studies showing that 1) natural mutants of apo-E that display defective binding have single amino acid substitutions at residues 145, 146, or 158; and 2) the apo-E epitope of the monoclonal antibody 1D7, which inhibits apo-E binding, is centered around residues 139-146."
https://openalex.org/W2008143037,"The sulfhydryl reagent iodoacetamidofluorescein (IAF) was used to probe the structure of chromatin subunits in transcribed and nontranscribed regions of Physarum rDNA. IAF labels histone H3 -SH groups in the elongated monomeric subunits (A particles) from the transcribed region, but it does not label H3 in the 11S monomers from the nontranscribed central spacer. All H3 reactivity is lost from rDNA chromatin in the inactive spherule stage of Physarum. Restriction cleavage of rDNA chromatin generates fragments from the transcription unit with reactive H3 -SH groups, whereas fragments containing nontranscribed spacer sequences are unreactive. The extended rDNA chromatin contains all four core histones and other prominent proteins. Electron microscopy shows that most of the extended subunits consist of two roughly spherical bodies connected by a 50 bp nucleoprotein bridge."
https://openalex.org/W2107158301,"The gene that codes for the surface antigen of Plasmodium knowlesi sporozoites (CS protein) is unsplit and present in the genome in only one copy. The CS protein, as deduced from DNA sequence analysis of the structural gene, has an unusual structure with the central 40% of the polypeptide chain present as 12 tandemly repeated amino acid peptide units flanked by regions of highly charged amino acids. The protein has an amino-terminal hydrophobic amino acid signal sequence and a hydrophobic carboxy-terminal anchor sequence. The coding sequence of the gene has an AT content of 53%, compared with 70% AT in the 5' and 3' flanking sequences, and is contained entirely within an 11 kb Eco RI genomic DNA fragment. This genomic fragment expresses the CS protein in E. coli, indicating that the parasite promoter and ribosome binding site signals can be recognized in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1971465291,"Sigma-28 RNA polymerase is a minor form of Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase that is highly specific for transcription from a small number of promoter sites in the B. subtilis genome. We have followed transcription from two of these loci (P28-1 and P28-2) in vivo using a quantitative S1 nuclease mapping procedure. Both promoters are used at a modest rate in vegetatively growing cells (about 10 RNA copies per cell) and transcripts are initiated at the same start sites as found in vitro with the purified sigma 28-RNA polymerase. Transcription from the sigma 28 promoters varies somewhat with growth conditions and is shut off rapidly and almost completely after the first hour of sporulation. Neither sigma 28 transcripts is detected in vegetative cells of certain B. subtilis mutants (spoO classes A, B, E, and F) that are defective in sporulation. Transcription from these promoters is restored in second site revertants that are able to sporulate. Hence the action of sigma 28-RNA polymerase appears to be regulated by the spoO genes and the functions controlled by sigma 28-promoters may be closely tied to the system involved in the initiation of sporulation."
https://openalex.org/W1543796105,"When thrombin is complexed to the endothelial cell surface receptor thrombomodulin, it loses its procoagulant activities in that it no longer clots fibrinogen or activates factor V. Studies were initiated to determine if complex formation also blocks thrombin's other major procoagulant function, the activation of platelets. When bound to thrombomodulin, thrombin no longer induces platelets to either aggregate or release [14C] serotonin. Binding studies using 125I-labeled thrombin or diisopropyl phosphorothrombin indicate that the complex does not bind to the platelet. When thrombomodulin is added after thrombin has bound to the platelets, the thrombin rapidly redistributes onto the thrombomodulin. These data suggest that in addition to its other anticoagulant effects, thrombomodulin may also act to inhibit and/or reverse platelet activation by thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W2163673908,"Activation of some variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) genes involves a duplicative transposition to an expression site, which completes the gene by addition of a mini-exon coding for the 5′ 35 nucleotides of VSG mRNAs. Using a 22 nucleotide probe we have found some 200 copies of the mini-exon on a tandemly arranged 1.35 kb repetitive element. This repeat is highly conserved in three trypanosome species. The mini-exon on the repeat is flanked by a 5′ splice site that resembles the consensus sequence. We have not found a single mini-exon within 10 kb of the transposed VSG gene exon in the expression site. We propose a model in which the arrays of mini-exon repeats function as a repetitive promoter for efficient transcription of VSG genes."
https://openalex.org/W1567325248,"Light and GTP-dependent cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activation of rod disk membranes is rapidly quenched by ATP. Maximum speed of this effect occurs only with the weakest bleaches. Though it has been proposed that ATP mediates its effect through rapid phosphorylation of bleached rhodopsin, previous workers have found phosphorylation kinetics too slow by more than an order of magnitude to be causal in quenching of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activation. In this report, we use preparations retaining more endogenous rhodopsin kinase, higher specific activity ATP, and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase quenching conditions to show that ATP-dependent multiple phosphorylation of rhodopsin at very weak bleaches (10(-5)) is complete in less than 2 s, easily compatible with cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase quench times of 4 s measured under identical conditions. Thus, it seems likely that previous efforts to achieve high 32P counts by using large bleaches have produced conditions of substrate saturation where much longer times to completion are caused by a very large ratio of substrate to enzyme velocity. Such conditions are not appropriately compared to those that support rapid quenching. We conclude that the speed of rhodopsin phosphorylation is, in fact, adequate to explain ATP quenching of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1990315003,"We have combined molecular genetic and cell-free reconstitution approaches to study the mechanism of membrane assembly. The coding region for the carboxy-terminal transmembrane sequence of membrane IgM heavy chain has been inserted between the coding regions for lactamase and globin domains of a fusion protein previously shown to be completely translocated across microsomal membranes in a cell-free transcription-linked translation system. The resulting fusion protein behaves as an integral transmembrane protein of predicted asymmetry: all of the membrane integrated copies display lactamase within the lumen and globin on the cytoplasmic face of the vesicles. In another construction, this transmembrane coding region replaces that of the signal sequence. The resulting fusion protein is not translocated across membranes. These data provide strong evidence that there are stop transfer sequences whose ability to arrest chain translocation and achieve asymmetric transmembrane orientation is independent of the size of the subsequent carboxy-terminal domain to be localized in the cytosol; and that signal and stop transfer sequences are functionally distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2020464460,"E. coli RecA protein promotes the homologous pairing of a single strand with duplex DNA even when certain features of the substrates, such as circularity, prohibit the true intertwining of the newly paired strands. The formation of such nonintertwined or paranemic joints does not require superhelicity, and indeed can occur with relaxed closed circular DNA. E. coli topoisomerase I can intertwine the incoming single strand in the paranemic joint with its complement, thereby topologically linking single-stranded DNA to all of the duplex molecules in the reaction mixture. The efficiency of formation of paranemic joints, the time course, and estimates of their length, all suggest that they represent true synaptic intermediates in the pairing reaction promoted by RecA protein."
https://openalex.org/W2077417728,"The leader RNA transcript of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been immunoprecipitated from infected BHK cell extracts by anti-La specific sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This association was specific as lupus anti-sera with other specificities failed to precipitate leader RNA. The amount of leader RNA associated with the La antigen peaked 4 hr post infection and then declined. Leader RNA complexed with viral nucleocapsid proteins increased at a slower rate but eventually predominated 6 hr post infection. By 16 hr all of the leader RNA was associated with nucleocapsid proteins. Although a significant portion of the leader RNA was present in isolated nuclei 4 hr post infection, all of the leader RNA outside the nucleus was bound to La protein. Leader RNA is the first non-RNA polymerase III product found to associate with the La protein. The proposed function of the leader-La complex in VSV transcription and replication and in viral cytopathology is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2002945079,"We have examined the organization of genomic sequences homologous to the spliced leader of Trypanosoma brucei variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) mRNA, using a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probe. These sequences are highly reiterated in the trypanosome genome and most are located in 1.4 kb units arranged in a direct tandem repeat. However, some of the 1.4 kb sequences are dispersed from the cluster(s) of tandem repeats and are flanked by non-repeat DNA. The number and arrangement of these leader sequence orphons varies among different T. brucei stocks. Within the IsTat serodeme, the arrangement of three of four spliced leader orphons observed with Eco RV digestion was stable during a chronic infection and cyclic transmission through the insect vector. The fourth Eco RV orphon, however, undergoes rearrangement during antigenic variation and life-cycle differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2076477732,"A new IS element (IS200) has been identified in Salmonella. The sequence was identified as an IS element by the following criteria: its insertion caused the mutation hisD984; six copies of the sequence are present in strain LT2 of S. typhimurium; and transposition of the sequence has been observed on several occasions. IS200 is found in almost all Salmonella species examined but is absent from most other enteric bacteria. The specificity of this element for Salmonella (and the absence of IS1-IS4 from Salmonella) suggest that transfer of insertion sequences between bacterial groups may be less extensive than is commonly believed. Alternatively, the distribution may suggest that these elements play a selectively important role in bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2076737643,"Most components necessary for the biosynthesis of mitochondrial tRNAs are coded by nuclear genes, but one mitochondrial locus other than the tRNA genes themselves is required to make functional tRNAs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequence analysis of this yeast mitochondrial tRNA synthesis locus is reported here. This region of mitochondrial DNA is almost exclusively A+T-rich DNA with one G+C-rich element. Despite the unusual structure of the DNA in this region, we have demonstrated that it codes for a heretofore unidentified mitochondrial transcript about 450 bases in length. Since this RNA is the only RNA encoded by the tRNA synthesis locus, it must be the active agent of the locus. This RNA could either act autonomously through RNA-RNA interactions or as part of an RNA-protein complex to effect tRNA biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1566504836,"Abstract The diastereomeric forms of adenosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphorothioate, Rp cAMPS and Sp cAMPS, were studied in isolated hepatocytes from fed rats for their ability to interact with the intracellular cAMP-dependent protein kinase and to affect the phosphorylase kinase-phosphorylase glycogenolytic cascade. Incubation of the cells with increasing concentrations of Sp cAMPS produced a concentration-dependent activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with a concomitant increase in the glycogenolytic rate. Half-maximal and maximal velocities of glycogenolysis were reached at 8 X 10(-7) and 1 X 10(-5) M Sp cAMPS, respectively. Incubation of the cells with 10(-9) to 10(-4) M Rp cAMPS had no effect on basal glucose production or on cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Incubation of the cells simultaneously with 3 X 10(-6) M Sp cAMPS and increasing concentrations of Rp cAMPS produced half-maximal inhibition of glycogenolysis at 1 X 10(-5) M Rp cAMPS and maximal inhibition at 1 X 10(-4) M. The concentrations of Sp cAMPS required for half-maximal and maximal activation of glycogenolysis were increased 10-fold when 1 X 10(-5) M Rp cAMPS was present. These data imply that Sp cAMPS is a cAMP-agonist while Rp cAMPS is a cAMP-antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W2020920066,"The zein proteins are the major storage proteins of maize endosperm. They are made from large amounts of zein RNAs of several distinct sizes, ranging from the small 900 base final size RNA to precursor forms of over 3800 bases. The 900 base mRNA and the smallest precursor mRNA of 1800 bases are transcribed from two distinct promoter regions, P1 and P2. In vitro transcription of a maize genomic clone containing a zein gene pML 1 allowed both promoters to be mapped. The sequence of pML 1, covering the two promoter regions, contained consensus transcription start sequences at both of the predicted promoters. S1 mapping with RNA prepared from maize endosperm showed that both P1 and P2 are active in vivo as double starts."

Glycoprotein D produced in these cells has a number of antigenic determinants in common with the native glycoprotein. Cell lines expressing glycoprotein D were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect human antibodies to glycoprotein D. This strategy should prove useful in determining the extent to which the immune response to HSV-1 is directed toward glycoprotein D.
https://openalex.org/W1973964858,"Small leader RNAs, copied from the extreme 3' ends of the minus and plus strands of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) genome, are thought to play a central role in the regulation of viral transcription and replication. We describe here a novel class of VSV mutants, denoted pol R, in which termination at leader sites in vitro is specifically suppressed. We have assayed for the presence of leader RNAs and readthrough transcripts in reaction products from standard virion templates (plus leader) and defective interfering particle templates (minus leader). In both cases, mutant virions gave rise to a much higher proportion of readthrough transcripts than wild type (greater than 80% vs approximately 10%). Reconstitution experiments with separated ribonucleoprotein (RNP) templates and polymerase protein fractions revealed, surprisingly, that the N protein moiety of the RNP template was responsible for readthrough. This conclusion was further supported by protein analyses that showed a similar charge change in the N protein of two independently isolated pol R VSV mutants. These results lead us to propose that modification of the N protein may regulate termination at leader RNA sites."
https://openalex.org/W31356543,"Based on the rationale that Escherichia coli cells containing increased levels of prolipoprotein signal peptidase would be highly resistant to globomycin, a specific inhibitor of the prolipoprotein signal peptidase, we have isolated a clone from the Carbon-Clarke collection, plasmid pLC3-13, which is globomycin-resistant and contains an increased level of prolipoprotein signal peptidase activity. The plasmid pMT521, a subclone of pLC3-13 in pBR322, conferred on its host cells approximately 20 times overproduction of prolipoprotein signal peptidase and an extremely high level of resistance against globomycin. The overproduced prolipoprotein signal peptidase was completely inhibited by the presence of globomycin in the in vitro assay, and the overproduced activity was found in the cell envelope fraction. Several lines of biochemical and genetic evidence suggest that the gene contained in pLC3-13 and its derivative clones is most likely the structure gene (lsp) for prolipoprotein signal peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1571901793,"The biochemical and pharmacological properties of the (Na+,K+)-ATPase have been studied at different stages of chick embryonic heart development in ovo and under cell culture conditions. The results show the existence of two families of ouabain binding sites: a low affinity binding site with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2-6 microM for the ouabain-receptor complex and a high affinity binding site with a Kd of 26-48 nM. Levels of high affinity sites gradually decrease during cardiac ontogenesis to reach a plateau near 14 days of development. Conversely the number of low affinity binding sites is essentially invariant between 5 days and hatching. Cultured cardiac cells display the same binding characteristics as those found in intact ventricles. Inhibition of 86Rb+ uptake in cultured cardiac cells and an increase in intracellular Na+ concentration, due to (Na+,K+)-ATPase blockade, occur in a ouabain concentration range corresponding to the saturation of the low affinity ouabain site. Ouabain-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake increases in parallel with the increase in the intracellular Na+ concentration. It is suppressed in Na+-free medium or when Na+ is replaced by Li+ suggesting that the increase is due to the indirect activation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchange system in the plasma membrane. Dose-response curves for the inotropic effects of ouabain on papillary muscle and on ventricular cells in culture indicate that the development of the cardiotonic properties is parallel to the saturation of the low affinity binding site for ouabain. Therefore, inhibition of the cardiac (Na+,K+)-ATPase corresponding to low affinity ouabain binding sites seems to be responsible for both the cardiotonic and cardiotoxic effects of the drug."
https://openalex.org/W1660535367,"recA protein, which is essential for genetic recombination in Escherichia coli, causes extensive of the double helix by an ATP-dependent reaction and accumulation of positive supercoiling in closed circular double-stranded DNA. Initiation of the extensive was largely dependent on homologous single-stranded DNA. Therefore, it is likely that the extensive is initiated mainly at the site of D-loops. Nascent in which the two DNA molecules did not interwind were also good initiation sites of extensive unwinding. When the concentration of Mg2+ was decreased from the standard conditions for D-loop formation (13 mM MgCl2; the higher Mg2+ condition) to the lower Mg2+ condition (1 to 2 mM MgCl2), extensive by recA protein was initiated very quickly in the absence of single-stranded DNA. Results showed that this single-stranded DNA-independent initiation of extensive (i) requires negative superhelicity of the double-stranded DNA and (ii) is a first order reaction with respect to the DNA. These observations suggest that, under the lower Mg2+ condition, the extensive starts at a transiently denatured site in the negative superhelical DNA. Once initiated, the by recA protein is propagated extensively, even under conditions that do not allow its initiation. Therefore, the propagation of is a processive reaction (processive unwinding). Previous studies indicated that recA protein promotes distributive unwinding of double helix which depends on single-stranded DNA. Therefore, recA protein promotes of the double helix by either of two distinct pathways. Stress caused by the processive could explain the dissociation of D-loops and reversible inactivation of the double-stranded DNA in a D-loop cycle."

In this study, storage protein receptors of the fat body membrane which were induced on pupation or on treatment of larval fat body with 20-hydroxyecdysone in vitro were identified. The binding of storage protein to its receptor required divalent cations, especially Ca2+, and the binding was very sensitive to pH. The storage protein receptor was inactivated when the fat body membrane was treated with trypsin. The storage protein receptor is probably a protein and it may be synthesized de novo or a cryptic form may be converted to the active form when the concentration of 20-hydroxyecdysone in the hemolymph reaches a physiological level."
https://openalex.org/W2105032695,"We have shown that high-frequency phenotypic switching of a transfected gene is associated with alterations in chromatin structure. To examine this phenomenon further, a plasmid containing HSV thymidine kinase and human alpha- and gamma-globin genes was transfected into mouse L cells. All three genes were expressed through utilization of their individual promoters. One of these cell lines was capable of switching to its TK- phenotype at high frequencies (8%-10%). The revertants (TK-) had no TK or globin transcripts, while the rerevertants (TK+) expressed all three genes at their original levels. We conclude that genes introduced into cells by ligated cotransfection can be regulated coordinately and that the unit of this regulated expression can be at least 20 kb long."
https://openalex.org/W1536844713,"Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were mutagenized and variants resistant to 10, 160, and 2000 times the ouabain lethal dose for wild type cells selected. The phenotypes were stable in the absence of selection. The frequencies with which variants were recovered were consistent with genetic alterations being responsible for drug resistance. It was shown that 50% of the (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity present in mutant cells had a higher Kd for ouabain than normal while 50% remained wild type for ouabain binding. Wild type MDCK cells were measured to have 2 X 10(6) ouabain binding sites per cell with a Kd for the drug of 0.6-1.0 X 10(-7) M. The novel (Na+, K+)-ATPase activities in the mutants demonstrated Kd values for ouabain of 10(-5) M, 3 X 10(-4) M, or 3 X 10(-3) M for the different mutant classes tested. The rate of synthesis of the (Na+, K+)-ATPase as well as the total amount of enzyme per unit of cell protein was unaltered in the mutants. Comparison of the alpha subunit of the enzyme, known to contain the ouabain-binding site, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis did not reveal any difference in the size of this subunit in mutant versus wild type cells."
https://openalex.org/W1515332559,"Isolated mouse peritoneal macrophages that had been stimulated with thioglycolate were shown to take up and degrade normal human 125I-very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). Uptake occurred via a specific cell surface receptor which was shown to be 1) temperature-dependent, 2) calcium-dependent, and 3) susceptible to proteolytic digestion. The receptor-mediated uptake and degradation of VLDL markedly stimulated the synthesis and accumulation of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester within macrophages. The degradation of the protein and lipid portions of VLDL occurred within lysosomes. Competition studies showed that the binding site for VLDL was different from the receptor for normal low density lipoproteins or for acetylated low density lipoproteins but that there was cross competition with beta-VLDL. In addition, positive charges appeared to play an important role in the recognition of VLDL by their receptors since polyamines were able to markedly inhibit VLDL binding, degradation, and lipid accumulation while negatively charged compounds were without effects. These studies indicate that 1) stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages possess specific receptors which recognize normal human VLDL and 2) the receptor-mediated uptake of VLDL results in the accumulation of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester within macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2027830308,"To analyze the rabbit immunoglobulin kappa locus, we isolated, from a phenotypically homozygous b4/b4 rabbit genomic library, a C kappa gene corresponding to the b4 var allelic form of the b4 C kappa gene. We also determined the nucleotide sequence of the J kappa cluster 3 kb upstream of the b4 var C kappa gene. Southern blot experiments with rabbit J kappa probes indicate that the bas C kappa gene is an isotype probably associated with its own J kappa segment(s). The rabbit b4 J kappa gene region contains a cluster of five J kappa segments, homologous to the human J kappa cluster, and two remnant J kappa segments approximately 5 kb upstream of the b4 C kappa gene. Nucleotide sequence analyses of the coding J kappa segments and their recombination signal sequences show only one functional J kappa segment. Comparisons with the protein data indicate that the rabbit kappa gene family, unlike its human and mouse homologs, increases kappa light chain variability by deletions and insertions at the V-J junction."
https://openalex.org/W14691291,"Abstract Previously, we demonstrated that isolated coupling factor 1 can reversibly synthesize ATP from tightly bound ADP and medium Pi (Feldman, R I., and Sigman, D. S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 25, 1676-1683). In order to ensure that the thermodynamic constants derived are relevant to coupled ATP synthesis, we have also studied the reaction on thylakoid membranes. The ATP synthase complex, uncoupled with 20 mM NH4Cl or 0.3% Triton X-100, synthesizes enzyme-bound ATP in a similar manner to coupling factor 1. The pH optimum is 6, the concentration of medium Pi for 50% saturation is 38 mM, and the equilibrium constant for the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi is 0.5. It is concluded that the active site responsible for the reaction is not appreciably altered by the dissociation of coupling factor 1 from the membrane or Fo. Thus, either enzyme form can be used to derive data relevant to the mechanism of ATP synthesis. The ability to measure ATP synthesis in an energizable system will allow us to probe the effect of membrane energization on the accumulated product."
https://openalex.org/W2391479155,"We have characterized the binding of 125I-labeled human beta-endorphin (125I-beta H-endorphin) to sites present on the terminal fluid-phase complex of human complement, consisting of complement components C5b, C6, C7, C8, C9, and the S-protein (SC5b-9 complex). Specific binding exhibited saturability, reversibility, structural specificity, temperature dependence, and absence of negative cooperative effects. Binding was maximal at 4 degrees C and pH 7.0; it was diminished by monovalent and divalent cations as well as by increasing concentrations of urea and Triton X-100 and apparently required intact disulfide groups. Binding was not inhibited by a number of opioid peptides sharing common sequences with the NH2 terminus of beta H-endorphin. In contrast, binding was inhibited by beta H-endorphin, N-acetyl-beta H-endorphin, and a series of COOH-terminal beta H-endorphin fragments, where of the COOH-terminal dipeptide Gly-Glu represented the minimal effective structure. Stepwise extension towards the NH2 terminus led to an increased binding affinity of the respective fragment. Computer resolution of competition curves yielded one binding component for several shorter COOH-terminal beta H-endorphin fragments and for beta H-endorphin (1-5) + (16-31), whereas two distinct binding components were obtained when beta H-endorphin (27-31), beta H-endorphin (6-31), N-acetyl-beta H-endorphin or beta H-endorphin were used as inhibitors. This study presents detailed data on the binding of COOH-terminal beta H-endorphin fragments to specific nonopiate binding sites present on the terminal SC5b-9 complex of human complement. We suggest that through this interaction, beta H-endorphin may modulate certain functions within the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W26358482,"The complete amino acid sequence of cytochrome c-553 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki has been determined. The protein has a single polypeptide chain containing 79 amino acid residues and has the typical characteristics of small mitochondrial cytochromes. Contrary to the expectation that the amino acid sequence of cytochrome c-553 from D. vulgaris Miyazaki is closely related to that from D. vulgaris Hildenborough, the two are not alike, except for the 20 NH2-terminal residues and the 4 carboxyl-terminal residues; however, the tryptic peptides obtained from the two cytochromes are similar to each other. The sequence of cytochrome c-553 from D. vulgaris Miyazaki resembles that of Pseudomonas cytochrome c-551. The phylogenetic situation of Desulfovibrio cytochrome c-553 in the phylogenetic tree of the cytochrome c super-family is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2087971297,"We studied the formation of linked circular DNA molecules promoted by the combined action of rec 1 protein and type I topoisomerase of Ustilago maydis. When ATP was added as cofactor to reactions containing rec 1 protein, pairs of homologous circular DNA molecules became linked after addition of topoisomerase. Closed circular duplex molecules could be joined at homologous sites with circular single-stranded molecules or with other circular duplex molecules, provided that homologous single-stranded DNA fragments or RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphates were also added. Complexes formed were topologically linked through regions of heteroduplex DNA. When the analog adenylyl-imidodiphosphate was substituted for ATP, nonhomologous pairs of circular DNA molecules became linked."
https://openalex.org/W1497361374,"Using inside-out vesicles of human red cell membranes, the effects of cytoplasmic Na+ in the range 0-5 mM on ATP-dependent 22Na+ influx (normal efflux) and 86Rb+ efflux (normal influx) were tested. The sodium pump stoichiometry, i.e. the ratio of net 22Na+ influx:86Rb+ efflux was reduced markedly when the cytoplasmic Na+ was reduced to less than 1 mM. Reduction in cytoplasmic Na+ concentration was associated also with a decreased sensitivity of the pump to effects of extracellular Rb+. Thus, extracellular (intravesicular) Rb+ stimulation observed at high ATP concentration and inhibition observed at low ATP concentration were not observed when the cytoplasmic (extravesicular) Na+ concentration was reduced to less than or equal to 0.2 mM. It is suggested that at low cytoplasmic Na+, the pump can operate with less than maximal sites filled with Na+ ions. Under this condition, it is likely that an enzymic step associated with either the ion translocation step or the enzyme's conformational transition becomes rate-limiting."
https://openalex.org/W1480252641,"The orientation of the different subunits of complex III in the yeast inner mitochondrial membrane has been investigated by several different approaches. Immunoinhibition studies of cytochrome c reductase activity in intact mitoplasts and submitochondrial particles using IgG obtained from specific antisera against complex III, the iron-sulfur protein, core protein I, and core protein II suggested a transmembranous orientation of the complex with the antigenic sites of the iron-sulfur protein exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. A lack of immunoinhibition was observed with the IgG against either core protein suggesting that these proteins may not be involved in catalysis. Digestion of mitoplasts with chymotrypsin indicated that the protein mass of cytochromes b and c1 protrudes from the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane; however, the hemes of cytochrome b appear to be buried within the membrane while the heme of cytochrome c1 is partially exposed on the chymotrypsin-sensitive portion of the polypeptide. By contrast, the iron-sulfur protein does not protrude from the membrane as it is completely resistant to chymotrypsin digestion. Labeling with the hydrophilic membrane-impermeant probe diazobenzenesulfonate suggests that core protein II is exposed on both sides of the membrane but protrudes into the matrix; while core protein I is within the membrane. Immunoprecipitation studies of sodium dodecyl sulfate and Triton X-100-solubilized mitochondria with subunit-specific antisera suggest that cytochromes b and c1 and core protein I are tightly associated in complex III. By contrast, the iron-sulfur protein and core protein II are loosely associated with the other subunits of the complex such that they are dissociated by low concentrations of detergent."
https://openalex.org/W2016635355,"An HLA-B7 complementary DNA clone was used as a hybridization probe to analyze the segregation pattern of polymorphic class I restriction fragments in several families whose HLA types had been determined by serological techniques. In one family in which a crossover in the HLA region had occurred, a specific genomic fragment was mapped with respect to the crossover. In another family, a novel genomic fragment present in one child and absent in all other family members was observed. With the exception of this novel fragment, all polymorphic class I fragments observed in this study segregated with a serologically defined parental haplotype, a result consistent with HLA linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1553394468,"The spleen cells of a Balb/c mouse immunized with purified bovine calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase were fused with nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (P3-X63-Ag8-653). Antibody producing hybridomas were screened by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified phosphodiesterase as the antigen. One monoclonal cell line, CR-B1, was found to produce antibodies which showed positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactions with bovine brain calcineurin and rabbit muscle phosphorylase kinase in addition to phosphodiesterase. The antibody was purified and characterized. It was shown to immunoprecipitate the calmodulin (CaM)-dependent phosphodiesterase and phosphorylase kinase activities but not those of CaM itself, CaM-independent phosphodiesterase and the catalytic unit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The immunoprecipitation of phosphodiesterase could be inhibited by calcineurin and phosphorylase kinase. These results suggest that the antibody interacts at a common site on these calmodulin-dependent proteins. The antigenic determinant in phosphodiesterase does not appear to reside in the calmodulin-binding domain of the enzyme since the antibody and phosphodiesterase interaction is not inhibited by calmodulin, and the calmodulin activation of phosphodiesterase is not affected by CR-B1 antibody. It is therefore suggested that the structural similarity among the three calmodulin-dependent proteins extends beyond the calmodulin-binding domains."
https://openalex.org/W27669850,"The activity of a plasma membrane cAMP-phosphodiesterase in cultured ovarian granulosa cells was regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist [D-Ala6]des-Gly10-GnRH N-ethylamide (GnRHa). Degradation of cAMP was similar in cultures treated with FSH alone or FSH plus GnRHa when the labeled cyclic nucleotide was added from 24 to 42 h of culture. However, at 48 h and subsequent times of incubation, cAMP phosphodiesterase activity was significantly higher in cells incubated with FSH plus GnRHa. Phosphodiesterase activity was progressively increased by GnRHa concentrations between 10(-13) and 10(-10) M, and was maximally stimulated by 10(-9) M GnRHa. In comparison with control cells, FSH lowered the Vmax of cAMP catabolism by the high (1 microM cAMP substrate) and the low (50 microM) affinity phosphodiesterase, while GnRHa raised enzyme activity toward control levels. These actions of FSH and GnRHa were specific for a plasma membrane phosphodiesterase that was accessible to extracellular cAMP, since extracellular substrate was hydrolyzed, no intracellular uptake of [3H]cAMP was observed, and only a small fraction (10%) of cAMP was catabolized in the incubation medium in the absence of cells. Further, the actions of FSH and GnRHa on the membrane enzyme were the opposite of those observed when total phosphodiesterase activity was measured in cellular sonicates. Hormonal changes in phosphodiesterase activity were not due to leakage of the enzyme from damaged cells since a constant percentage of cAMP hydrolysis in the medium was observed during culture. Analysis of cAMP catabolites in granulosa cells indicated that the phosphodiesterase reaction product, 5'-AMP, was rapidly converted to adenosine by a plasma membrane 5'-nucleotidase, independent of the cellular hormonal status. These results indicate that the opposing actions of FSH and GnRHa upon granulosa cell differentiation include modulation of cAMP degradation at the plasma membrane level."
https://openalex.org/W1490843371,"Abstract Artificial myoglobins (Mbs) substituted for protoheme with Co(II) proto-and mesoporphyrins IX (proto-and meso-CoMbs, respectively) were prepared. The principal values and eigenvectors of g tensors and the hyperfine coupling tensors of the paramagnetic Co(II) centers of their deoxy forms have been determined by single crystal EPR spectroscopy at 77 K in order to elucidate orientation and electronic structure of the prosthetic group in myoglobin. The orientation of the porphyrin plane of deoxy meso-CoMb were found to be identical to that of deoxy proto-CoMb. However, the in-plane hyperfine coupling constants of deoxy meso-CoMb were more anisotropic and larger than those of deoxy proto-CoMb, suggesting an increase in the electron spin density on the Co(II) ion upon the exchange of protoporphyrin IX with mesoprophyrin IX. Powder EPR spectra of these CoMbs, which were measured at S- and L-band microwave frequencies, exhibited well resolved 59Co hyperfine splittings and can be clearly interpreted by the use of the EPR parameters obtained from single crystal EPR measurements."
