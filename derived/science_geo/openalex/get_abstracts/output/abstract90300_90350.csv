https://openalex.org/W1964491904,"Anaerobically treated sewage sludge was found to contain extraordinarily high concentrations of 4-nonylphenol, a metabolite derived from nonionic surfactants of the nonylphenol polyethoxylate type. Concentrations in activated sewage sludge, in mixed primary and secondary sludge, and in aerobically stabilized sludge were substantially lower, suggesting that the formation of 4-nonylphenol is favored under mesophilic anaerobic conditions. Because 4-nonylphenol may be highly toxic to aquatic life, further research is needed on the fate of 4-nonylphenol after sludge is disposed of in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W1559767698,"A thermodynamic approach was adopted for determining the stoichiometry of the cardiac Na-Ca exchange system. Vesicles were equilibrated with 0.1 mM 45CaCl2 in a medium containing 30 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, and 110 mM LiCl. The vesicles were then treated with valinomycin and diluted into media containing the same 45CaCl2 and NaCl concentrations as in the equilibration medium but with the external KCl concentration adjusted so as to impose either positive or negative membrane potentials (delta psi). 45Ca2+ uptake ensued upon establishing a positive (inside) potential whereas 45Ca2+ efflux was observed for a negative delta psi. These delta psi-dependent Ca2+ movements did not occur if NaCl was omitted from the media, indicating that they were mediated by the Na-Ca exchanger. High concentrations of either NaCl or CaCl2 inhibited the delta psi-dependent Ca2+ movements. To determine the exchange stoichiometry, a series of Na+ gradients were established across the vesicle membrane so as to oppose the effects of a constant delta psi (either positive or negative) on Ca2+ movements. The stoichiometry n could be determined from the magnitude of the Na+ gradient that exactly compensated for delta psi such that no net Ca2+ movement occurred. This point is defined by the relation (n - 2)delta psi = nENa where ENa is the equilibrium potential for Na+ under these conditions. The value of n (+/- S.E.) determined in this way was 2.97 +/- 0.03 (n = 9)."

https://openalex.org/W2033695951,"The eyes of 15 species of birds from 10 families have some cones maximally sensitive at 370 nanometers in the near-ultraviolet. Spectral sensitivity was measured by recording extracellularly in opened eyecups , and a maximum in the ultraviolet was revealed by selectively adapting the retina with yellow background lights. The 370-nanometer spectral sensitivity function is attributed to receptors because its spectral position does not vary with the strength of adaptation and because it is present when the receptor potentials are isolated from the contributions of higher order retinal neurons by exposing the retina to sodium aspartate. These measurements demonstrate the basis for the ultraviolet sensitivity of birds that has been seen in behavioral experiments, and they provide further evidence that many vertebrates share with insects vision in the near-ultraviolet."
https://openalex.org/W1503523628,"The structure of branched lactosaminoglycan isolated from Band 3 glycoprotein of adult human erythrocytes was elucidated. The glycopeptides were digested by endo-beta-galactosidase under various conditions and oligosaccharides and core glycopeptides thus obtained and intact glycopeptides were analyzed by methylation, exoglycosidase digestion, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. Based on these experiments, the structure of adult lactosaminoglycan was found to have the following unique features: 1) two (as major components) or three (as minor components) polylactosaminyl side chains composed of (Gal beta 1----4 GlcNAc beta 1----3) repeating units are attached to the core portion, the structure of which is Man alpha 1----6(Man alpha 1----3) [+/- GlcNAc beta 1----4]Man beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----6)GlcNAc----Asn, 2) the polylactosaminyl side chain arising from the mannose C-6 side is composed of 10-12 N-acetyllactosaminyl units and three branches; the lactosaminyl side chain arising from the mannose C-3 side is composed of 5-6 lactosaminyl units and contains one or two branches, 3) each branch is short and is composed of the Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc beta 1----6 structure, 4) fucose and sialic acid are preferentially linked to nonreducing terminal regions but not on the branches in the internal portion of the polylactosaminyl chain."
https://openalex.org/W2053994567,"The adaptive significance of morphological traits can be assessed by measuring and identifying the forces of selection acting on them. Boag and Grant documented directional selection in a small population of Darwin's medium ground finches, Geospiza fortis, on I. Daphne Major, Gal√°pagos, in 1977. Large beak and body size were favoured at a time of diminishing food supply and high adult mortality. We show here that in two subsequent periods of moderate to high adult mortality (1980 and 1982), the population was subject to the same selection. We have used a recently developed technique to ascertain the targets of direct selection. Beak depth and body weight were commonly under direct selection to increase but, surprisingly, beak width was directly selected to decrease, over all three periods of mortality. The results have implications for our understanding of evolutionary change in morphological traits of Darwin's finches."
https://openalex.org/W2095393453,"Northern blot analysis of total RNA and polyadenylated RNA isolated from adult rat testes showed that a proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-like messenger RNA molecule is present in these extracts. The testicular POMC messenger RNA is comparable in length to amygdala and midbrain POMC messenger RNA and appears to be at least 200 nucleotides shorter than POMC messenger RNA found in the hypothalamus and anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland. Hybridization in situ showed that POMC messenger RNA is located in Leydig cells, which are the only testicular cells that contain immunostainable POMC-derived peptides. These results suggest that local synthesis of POMC occurs in the testis."
https://openalex.org/W1979905294,"The first ultraviolet resonance Raman measurements of a coal liquid are reported. The spectra detail the presence of numerous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with ring systems similar to those of naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, pyrene, and triphenylene. The ultraviolet resonance Raman measurements of this highly complex sample show no significant interference from fluorescence. The lack of fluorescence interference and the high selectivity indicate that ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy is a powerful new technique for characterizing highly complex samples and mixtures."

These proteins are identical with those induced by the tumor promoter TPA. The inducing signal is generated by DNA damage, as these proteins are induced by lower doses of UV in fibroblasts from patients with Cockayne's syndrome or Xeroderma pigmentosum. In the supernatant of UV-treated cells, a heat-labile ammonium sulfate precipitable factor of more than 10 kd (EPIF) was detected which, upon transfer to nonirradiated cells, mimicked UV in the UV-induced synthesis of gene products. The response to UV, TPA, or EPIF was inhibited by fluocinolone acetonide, but not by retinoic acid, protease inhibitors, or superoxide dismutase."

https://openalex.org/W2040517141,"We examined whether the activation of muscle gene expression in nonmuscle cells required DNA synthesis. Human fibroblasts from amniotic fluid and fetal lung were fused with differentiated mouse muscle cells in the presence or absence of the DNA synthesis inhibitor, cytosine arabinoside. In the stable heterokaryons formed, the human contractile enzyme, MM-creatine kinase (CK), and the cell surface antigen, 5.1H11, were detected in comparable amounts regardless of whether DNA synthesis had occurred. A single cell analysis revealed that the efficiency of gene activation was high and that DNA synthetic activity was not affected by the ratio of muscle to nonmuscle nuclei in the heterokaryons. In addition, muscle gene expression was not restricted to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. We conclude that cell differentiation can be reprogrammed in heterokaryons regardless of cell cycle phase and in the absence of detectable DNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2022682236,"Early passages of the human teratocarcinoma cell line PA1 are not tumorigenic in nude mice, while late passages are. A transforming gene present in late passages of PA1 cells was isolated as a biologically active molecular clone and is a new isolate of the human rasN locus. Its transforming activity is due to a single G---A (G, guanine; A, adenine) point mutation at the codon for amino acid 12 which changes the codon for glycine so that an aspartic acid residue is expressed. In contrast to late passage PA1 cells (passages 106, 330, and 338), DNA from the PA1 cell line at early passages (passage 36) does not yield rasN foci in DNA transfection assays. Thus, the presence of an activated rasN in PA1 cells correlates with enhanced tumorigenicity of the cell line and, more importantly, may have arisen during cell culture in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1998128863,"The nucleotide sequence of a transforming human c-sis complementary DNA shows an open reading frame 723 base pairs in length located downstream from an in-phase terminator thymine-guanine-adenine codon. Sequences within this region were identical to those previously determined for the exons of the normal human c-sis gene. Thus, the predicted transforming product, a protein of 27,281 daltons, may be the actual precursor for normal human platelet-derived growth factor chain A."
https://openalex.org/W2005159933,"Mitochondrial DNA from bovine tissue contains heterogeneous sequences located within an evolutionary conserved cytosine homopolymer sequence near the 5' end of the D-loop region. This part of the mammalian mitochondrial genome is known to contain the origin of heavy strand DNA synthesis and the major transcriptional promoter for each strand. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned DNA and electrophoretic analysis of appropriate small fragments from animal tissue reveal a population of length polymorphs containing from nine to 19 cytosine residues. No individual length species represents more than 40% of the population. These data imply a state of significant intraanimal mtDNA sequence heterogeneity, which most likely occurs intracellularly as well. The localization of variability to a homopolymer run suggests that replication slip-page generated the sequence population. We also report that when recombinant clones containing this region are repeatedly passaged in E. coli, they begin to regenerate length variation similar to that seen in animal mtDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1504380923,"The coupling site of the Na+ pump to the respiratory chain of Vibrio alginolyticus was examined using membrane fractions prepared from the wild type, Na+ pump-deficient mutants, and spontaneous revertant. NADH oxidase of the wild type and revertant specifically required NA+ for maximum activity, whereas Na+ was not essential for the NADH oxidase of mutants. Similar to the Na+ pump in whole cells, the Na+-dependent NADH oxidase in membranes had a pH optimum in the alkaline region. A respiratory inhibitor, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO), inhibited the Na+-dependent NADH oxidase but had little effect on the NA+-independent activity of mutant membranes. NADH:quinone oxidoreductase was found to be the Na+-dependent HQNO-sensitive site of the NADH oxidase. In the wild type cells, HQNO was also found to cause a strong inhibition of the Na+ pump with little effect on the overall H+ extrusion by respiration. The inhibition of the Na+ pump by HQNO was overcome by oxidized, but not reduced, N,N,N',N'-tetra-methyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD). In the presence of oxidised TMPD, the electron flow NADH to oxygen seemed to bypass the HQNO-sensitive site and energize the Na+ pump. From these results, it was concluded that the Na+ pump is coupled to the respiratory chain at the step of NADH:quinone oxidoreductase."

https://openalex.org/W2019148270,"Living bone drives an electric current through itself and into sites of damage. Such ""fracture currents"" consist of two components: an intense, decaying current dependent on bone deformation and a stable, persistent current driven by a cellular battery. The latter is carried by chloride ions and, to a lesser extent, by sodium, magnesium, and calcium ions. Endogenous fracture currents are of the same polarity and similar magnitude as clinically applied currents that are successful in treating chronic nonunions in fractured bones. This suggests that the defect in biological nonunions may reside in the electrophysiology of repair."
https://openalex.org/W2061649443,"When one is riding in a vehicle, perceptual thresholds for motion of objects are significantly elevated above those determined under corresponding but simulated conditions in the laboratory without concurrent self-motion perception. Authorities on road traffic accidents should thus consider an additional perceptual time of at least 300 milliseconds for detecting critical changes in headway beyond the usual reaction time. Detection times thus corrected consequently lead to an alteration of our conception of safe intervehicle distances in a convoy. This elevation of thresholds for object-motion during self-motion, with its consequences for visual control of vehicle guidance, can be seen as a disadvantageous side effect of an otherwise beneficial space-constancy mechanism, which provides us with a stable world during locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W1983947144,"The transport of pigment through the long cytoplasmic extensions (arms) of teleost melanophores is a microtubule-dependent event. We have severed the arms from melanophores to test whether microtubules isolated from the centrosome maintain their original polarity and disposition. In addition, we have tested whether arms containing microtubules of mixed polarities alter the direction of pigment transport. We find that microtubules within severed arms eventually change their polarity and reorganize from the arm center as if to form a new minicell. Concomitant with this change is a reversal in the direction of pigment transport."
https://openalex.org/W1519224705,"Regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34, reductase) activity was studied in cultured rat intestinal epithelial cells using 3-beta-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one ( U18666A ), an inhibitor of 2,3- oxidosqualene cyclase (EC 5.4.99.7, cyclase) that causes cellular accumulation of squalene 2,3:22,23-dioxide ( Sexton , R. C., Panini , S.R., Azran , F., and Rudney , H. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 5687-5692). Treatment of cells with U18666A (5-50 ng/ml) caused a progressive inhibition of reductase activity. Further increases in the level of the drug paradoxically lessened the inhibition such that at a level of 1 microgram/ml, no inhibition of enzyme activity was observed. Cellular metabolism of squalene 2,3:22,23-dioxide to compounds with the chromatographic properties of polar sterols led to an inhibition of reductase activity that could be prevented by U18666A (1 microgram/ml). The drug was unable to prevent the inhibition of enzyme activity by 25-hydroxycholesterol or mevalonolactone, but totally abolished the inhibitory action of low density lipoproteins. Pretreatment with U18666A did not affect the ability of cells to degrade either the apoprotein or the cholesteryl ester component of low density lipoproteins. These results suggest that oxysterols derived from squalene 2,3:22,23-dioxide may act as physiological regulators of reductase and raise the possibility that the suppressive action of low density lipoproteins on reductase may be partially or wholly mediated by such endogenous oxysterols generated through incomplete inhibition of the cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1566985738,"We report that adenovirus 2 DNA sequences located between positions-66 and -51 upstream of the major late cap site (position +1) enhance transcription initiation from this promoter by up to 5- to 10-fold in HeLa whole cell lysates. This enhancing effect is template concentration-dependent and is abolished by truncation of the template immediately upstream of -66. Additionally, specific transcripts are not detected from templates truncated at +33 downstream of the cap site. These results define a minimum region of approximately 100 base pairs encompassing the transcription start site that appears to interact with the RNA polymerase II transcription complex during initiation. Analysis of the shortest runoff transcripts that can be synthesized in vitro revealed that RNAs as short as 50 nucleotides are quantitatively modified by guanylylation and methylation to cap 1 structures. In contrast, short RNAs containing guanylylated but unmethylated cap structures are not efficiently utilized as substrates by endogenous cap-methylating enzymes in the HeLa lysate. These findings, together with the observation that the synthesis of short transcripts is sensitive to the presence of the methyltransferase inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine, suggest that cap formation is a promoter-proximal event that occurs concomitantly with the synthesis of a nascent RNA polymerase II transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1506059273,"The membrane attack complex (MAC) of complement and its precursors, i.e. C5b-7 and C5b-8, were examined by electron microscopy. C5b-7 bound to lipid vesicles exhibits an extended structure of 25 nm connected to the lipid membrane via a 10-nm long, 3-nm wide stalk. Binding of C8 to vesicle-bound C5b-7 results in the disappearance of this stalk, whereas the overall length remains unchanged. Addition of 12 C9 molecules per C5b-8 induces C9 polymerization which is accompanied by the formation of C9 tubules and membrane lesions. By using biotinyl precursors and streptavidin -coated colloidal gold particles, C5b-6, C7, and C8 was found to be in the club-like part of the MAC; C9 was identified in the tubular moiety. Only one C5b-8 moiety was detected in an individual MAC complex thus excluding the proposed dimeric structure of the MAC. A membrane channel of 10 nm was formed by the MAC at a C9 to C5b-8 ratio equal or larger than 12 to 1, as suggested by the penetration of negative stain into the vesicle. In contrast, binding of an average of three C9 per C5b-8 caused formation of incomplete C9 tubules with apparent membrane channels of less than 10 nm diameter. The MAC isolated from red blood cells was ultrastructurally heterogenous . Although an excess of serum was used for the formation of the complexes, mostly incomplete poly C9 tubules were formed. It is proposed that the MAC is an ultrastructurally heterogenous complex that induces the formation of membrane channels of different sizes."

Cell Biol. 79, 97-109) to analyze the products of micrococcal nuclease digestion of adult chicken erythrocyte nuclei. By dot-blot hybridization with specific gene probes, it is found that nucleosomes from the globin gene domain, including a region extending to about 10 kilobase pairs 5' to the beta p gene are selectively enriched in the fractions eluted at low salt. In contrast, a single copy sequence located at about 10 kilobase pairs 5' to the beta p gene was concentrated in the less salt-soluble fractions. The vitellogenin and ovalbumin genes, which are never expressed in erythroid tissues, are also concentrated in the less salt-soluble fractions. Some more generally expressed genes (histone H4, thymidine kinase) appear to be more uniformly distributed. The low salt fractions are depleted in H1/H5, enriched in high mobility group 14 and 17, and contain somewhat more highly acetylated histones."
https://openalex.org/W1561216036,The ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase of spinach chloroplasts was purified from a Triton X-100 thylakoid extract closely associated with an intrinsic polypeptide of 17.5 kDa. The 17.5-kDa polypeptide-reductase complex differs from soluble ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase in (a) its elution profile in an Affi-Gel blue column; (b) its behavior in isoelectric focusing electrophoresis; and (c) giving different immunoelectrophoretic arcs. The diaphorase activity of the purified complex showed the same pH profile of thylakoid-bound reductase. The curve changed to a form similar to that of soluble reductase after dissociation of the complex. Dissociation allowed separation of the components and was reversible. It is suggested that the 17.5-kDa intrinsic polypeptide is the reductase-binding protein and that it may play an important role in the physiological regulation of the reductase and of photosynthetic electron transport.
https://openalex.org/W1580112815,"The composition of the tubular structure of the membrane attack complex of complement (MAC) which migrates as a high molecular weight band (Mr approximately 1.2- 1.3 X 10(6) upon sodium dodecyl sulfate, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions was analyzed and compared to the high molecular weight band (Mr approximately 1.1 X 10(6] of tubular poly(C9). The sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant band of the MAC, designated MAC-poly(C9), is composed of C6, C7, C8 alpha-gamma, and poly(C9), in approximate molar ratios of the protomers of 1:1:1:10-18. This conclusion is based 1) on the results of the incorporation of labeled proteins into MAC-poly(C9); 2) on the immunostaining of MAC-poly(C9) with anti-C6, anti-C7, anti-C8 alpha-gamma, and anti-C9 and its lack of immunostaining with anti-C5 and anti-C8 beta; and 3) on the dissociation of MAC-poly(C9) to 1 mol of C6, C7, C8 alpha-gamma and 10 to 18 mol of C9 upon treatment with 8 M guanidine isothiocyanate. Ultrastructurally the sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant poly(C9) tubule and MAC-poly(C9) tubule are indistinguishable, suggesting a similar ultrastructure of the C6, C7, C8 alpha-gamma, and C9 subunits in the MAC-poly(C9) tubule. Further analogies among these four proteins are their tendency to form disulfide-linked dimers. It is concluded that the transmembrane channel of the MAC is formed by a tubule in which C6, C7, C8 alpha-gamma are copolymerized with poly(C9), whereas the C5b and C8 beta subunits are not part of the tubule structure and may form the 170-A long appendage of the MAC. This appendage is dissociated upon boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate whereas the tubule remains stable."

The 110K protein partitions into the detergent phase in Triton X-114 solutions. It is selectively incorporated into liposomes. It is specifically labeled with the hydrophobic probe 14C-phenylisothiocyanate. In addition we present a purification scheme for the 110K protein in milligram amounts. This represents the simplest system of membrane to filament attachment, in which an integral membrane protein is also a cytoskeletal protein."

The frequency-dependent contraction was decreased in hibernating animals but increased in nonhibernating animals. Caffeine caused a negative inotropic effect in hibernating animals but a positive inotropic effect in nonhibernating animals. Ryanodine caused greater inhibition in hibernating animals than in nonhibernating animals. These results suggest that the respective roles of the sources of calcium for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling are changed during hibernation.

Using 13C NMR spectroscopy, the C-11 resonance of anthramycin is shown to undergo a 16-ppm upfield shift upon formation of a covalent bond with DNA, indicative of an aminal linkage at that position. The site of attachment on the DNA is determined using the self-complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide d-(ApTpGpCpApT) as a DNA model. Proton NMR, both in H2O and D2O solutions, provides a direct characterization of the anthramycin-oligonucleotide adduct. Upon covalent attachment to the duplex, a loss in the helical symmetry is observed, resulting in a doubling of several of the oligonucleotide resonances. Examination of the data confirms that the point of attachment of the anthramycin to the d-(ApTpGpCpApT) is at the guanine-NH2-position, consistent with the model proposed by Hurley and Petrusek (Hurley, L.

https://openalex.org/W1575229615,"Plasma membrane-enriched fractions from disrupted S49 lymphoma cells contained high affinity sites for [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine, a potent and specific inhibitor of nucleoside transport. These sites were absent from similar preparations from AE1 cells, a nucleoside-transport deficient clone derived from the S49 cell line. Reversible binding of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine to the S49 membrane preparations was inhibited by adenosine, nitrobenzylthioguanosine, and dipyridamole. Exposure of S49 membrane preparations to UV light in the presence of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine resulted in the covalent radiolabeling of a membrane protein(s) which migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with an apparent Mr of 45,000 to 66,000. Labeling of this protein was abolished in the presence of nitrobenzylthioguanosine and markedly reduced in the presence of adenosine and dipyridamole.

https://openalex.org/W241130661,"Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopies are used to study the effects of cholesterol on human erythrocyte membrane acyl chain organization (mobility and conformation) and protein secondary structure. Compared to normal red cell membranes (approximately equal to 0.8 mol of cholesterol/mol of phospholipid) (C/P), acyl chain mobility is greater for the depleted (C/P approximately equal to 0.6) and less for the enriched (C/P approximately equal to 1.2) membranes as monitored by shifts of the IR symmetric methylene C-H stretching band (2852 wave numbers, cm-1) over the temperature range 5 to 40 degrees C. There is a continuous first order trend to the IR shifts, but no evidence of a phase change for any of the three cholesterol contents. Raman scattering of C-C stretching vibrations (1065-1130 cm-1) revealed that acyl chain conformation in the three membrane preparations is in a similar state of high disorder; however, compared to depleted and control membranes, the enriched membrane acyl chains display higher order lattice packing. The alpha-helical content of membrane proteins is correlated with the relative intensity of the Raman peptide backbone C-C stretching band (940 cm-1). Spectra of cholesterol-enriched erythrocyte membranes indicate a substantial increase in protein helical structure compared to those of the cholesterol-depleted membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1575732080,"Hexokinase (ATP: D-hexose-6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) activity was determined in subcellular fractions prepared from pea (Pisum sativum) leaf homogenates. About 60% of the total detectable activity of hexokinase was found associated with a particulate fraction consisting essentially of mitochondria and chloroplasts and free of cytosol contamination. The hexokinase specific activity of the particulate fraction was 2-fold higher than that of the homogenate and about 4-fold higher than that of the cytosol. Using a specially designed isokinetic-isopycnic sucrose density gradient centrifugation method, the distribution of hexokinase activity correlated with that of the mitochondrial marker (cytochrome oxidase) and not with that of the chloroplast membrane marker ( chlorophyll ) or that of the cytosol marker (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase). Thus, the hexokinase/mitochondria ratio was close to 1.0 along the entire gradient, while the hexokinase/chloroplast ratio varied over a 10-fold range. The results strongly suggest that hexokinase is predominantly bound to mitochondria of pea leaves, and that pea leaf chloroplasts are essentially devoid of any specifically associated hexokinase activity. This work provides the first demonstration of a specific association of hexokinase with mitochondria from photosynthetic tissues of higher plants."

Three groups of esters were identified as natural derivatives of acetic acid, acetoacetic acid, and 3-hydroxybutyric acid. The major ester fraction was identified as a mixture of C26 (10%), C27 (5%), and C28 (85%) oxoalcohol esters of acetoacetic acid. The major homolog consisted of equal amounts of 11-oxooctacosanyl 3-oxobutanoate and 12-oxooctacosanyl 3-oxobutanoate. Lesser amounts of 11- and 12-oxooctacosanyl and n-octacosanyl esters of acetic and 3-hydroxybutyric acids were also identified. The chain length distributions of these C26, C27, and C28 oxoalcohol and n-primary alcohol ester moieties, as well as the isomeric ratios for the 11- and 12-oxoalcohol isomers, were similar to the oxoaldehydes and unesterified oxoalcohols previously identified by Buckner et al (Buckner, J.

In the present study we have attempted to characterize those regions of H1 molecules which participate in cross-linking, and in particular, to determine whether the reaction involves two NH2-terminal domains, two COOH-terminal domains, or a combination of these two. When we used reconstituted chromatin, formed by the addition of various H1 peptides to H1-depleted chromatin, we observed poly(ADP-ribosylation) in those complexes containing fragments of the NG-H1 domain (i.e. NH2-terminal tail plus the globular (G) region). Furthermore, with this material, increasing NAD concentration and incubation time led to a progressive elongation of poly(ADP-Rib) on the peptide approaching a chain length of 11-12 units. Reconstituted chromatin that contained other H1-derived peptides, such as C-H1 and G-H1 (i.e. only carboxyl or only globular domains respectively), were not poly(ADP-ribosylated). CG-H1 was noted to be a substrate in the reconstituted system. However, in contrast to NG-H1, where extensive chain elongation was observed, only very short chain, probably mono(ADP-ribosylation) occurred on this H1 peptide. In a complementary approach, the H1 dimer complex or its precursors were cleaved with N-bromosuccinimide, and peptide fragments isolated. This analysis confirmed that both the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of H1 are poly(ADP-ribosylated) and that elongation of the ADP-ribose chain occurred primarily at the NH2 terminus during H1 dimer synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2050993109,"The severity and incidence of spinal lesions were manipulated in a line of chickens susceptible to scoliosis by varying their dietary intake of copper. A decrease in expression of the lesion was related to increased intake of copper. The change in expression, however, appeared to be related only indirectly to the defects in collagen cross-linking, maturation, and deposition known to be associated with dietary copper deficiency. Thus, a dietary constituent in the range of normal intakes may act as an environmental factor in the expression of scoliosis."
https://openalex.org/W35623920,"In heme-deficient reticulocyte lysates, protein synthesis initiation is inhibited due to the activation of a heme-regulated protein kinase which blocks protein synthesis by the specific phosphorylation of the alpha-sub-unit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2 alpha). The restoration of synthesis requires both hemin and glucose-6-P (Ernst, V., Levin, D. H., and London, I. M. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7163-7172). The sugar phosphate fulfills two functions in initiation: (i) the generation of NADPH, and (ii) an effector function in some step in initiation. This latter effect is readily demonstrated in lysates depleted of low molecular weight components by filtration in dextran gels. In gel-filtered lysates, linear protein synthesis is sustained only by the addition of both hemin (20 microM) and glucose-6-P (or 2-deoxyglucose-6-P) (50-500 microM). The omission of either component gives rise to inhibitions which are characterized by the activation of heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase and the concomitant phosphorylation of both endogenous heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase and endogenous eIF-2 alpha, indicating that glucose-6-P is involved in the regulation of heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase. In support of this, we find (a) that gel-filtered lysates incubated with hemin but depleted of glucose-6-P produce sufficient heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase to inhibit protein synthesis when mixed with normal hemin-supplemented lysates; (b) the inhibitions of protein synthesis produced by heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase generated either in glucose-6-P-depleted lysates or heme-deficient lysates are reversed by added eIF-2; and (c) the eIF-2 alpha kinase activities formed in the absence of either hemin or glucose-6-P are both neutralized by an anti-heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase antiserum. We conclude that the physiological activation of heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha kinase is controlled by both hemin and glucose-6-P."
https://openalex.org/W1606122435,"Lipid constitutents of diapausing pupae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (L), were identified by thin layer and gas-liquid chromatography, IR spectroscopy, and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Surface wax was a mixture of long chain polar compounds: oxoalcohol esters, oxoaldehydes, primary alcohol esters, and oxoalcohols, as listed in descending order of abundance. The distribution of the alcohols and aldehydes was C28 (75-85%), C27 (5%), and C26 (10-15%). The C26 compounds were largely 11-oxo isomers, but the C28 compounds consisted of similar amounts of 11- and 12-oxo isomers. The identities of the oxoaldehydes were confirmed by selective and complete NaBH4 reductions to yield oxoalcohols and diols, respectively. Mass spectral interpretations were verified with mass spectra of the oxoaldehyde, oxoalcohol, and diol synthesized from 12-hydroxystearic acid. Reduction of the total lipids with NaBH4 and hydrolysis of the product with ethanolic KOH gave oxoalcohols (85%), primary alcohols (8%), and oxoacids (5%); 30-40% of the oxoalcohols were derived from NaBH4-reduced oxoaldehydes, 5-10% were from free oxoalcohols, and 50% were from esters. Primary alcohols only existed as esters. Large quantities of fatty oxoalcohols relative to fatty oxoacids in the saponified mixture suggested the presence of esters other than those composed of long chain acids and alcohols. Oxoacids appeared to be mainly oxidation products of the oxoaldehydes."

With this purified enzyme, it was proved that dThd kinase exists in five enzyme variants in Physarum polycephalum, the acidic forms being phosphorylated. This protein modification is discussed under the aspect of the regulation of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1490225295,"Abstract Subcellular localization of histone acetyltransferase was studied in rat liver cells. Two histone acetyltransferases, designated NI and NII, were identified in the nuclear fraction, and an additional two acetyltransferases, termed CI and CII, were separated from the cytoplasmic fraction. These acetyltransferases exhibited different substrate specificities toward free and nucleosomal histones. The enzymes NI and NII represented major histone acetyltransferase activities in rat liver nuclei, and they were further differentiated by DNA-binding properties, subnuclear localization, and reaction kinetics. While the NI enzyme exhibited an intersecting initial velocity kinetic, the NII enzyme followed a ping-pong initial velocity pattern. These results show the multiple occurrence of histone acetyltransferases in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, events which may reflect the complexities of histone acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2016939410,Sensory axons were counted in untreated 1-month-old rats and in littermates that were injected with antibodies to nerve growth factor. There were 45 percent more unmyelinated and 17 percent more myelinated axons in dorsal roots of the fifth thoracic spinal segment in treated rats. This suggests that the number of sensory axons can be changed by postnatal inactivation of nerve growth factor.
