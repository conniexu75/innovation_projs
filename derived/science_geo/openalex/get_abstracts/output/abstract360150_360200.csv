Jeff Hasty and colleagues have now combined microfluidics, single-cell microscopy and computational modelling to develop a bacterial gene oscillator that is fast, robust, persistent and whose frequency can be tuned externally. Their combination of experimental and theoretical work reveals a simplified oscillator design without the need for positive feedback. Synthetic biologists aim to apply well-known principles of gene regulation to build living systems with desired properties. This study has combined microfluidics, single-cell microscopy and computational modelling to develop a bacterial gene oscillator that is fast, robust, persistent and whose frequency can be tuned externally. The combination of experimental and theoretical work reveals a simplified oscillator design without the need for positive feedback. One defining goal of synthetic biology is the development of engineering-based approaches that enable the construction of gene-regulatory networks according to ‘design specifications’ generated from computational modelling1,2,3,4,5,6. This approach provides a systematic framework for exploring how a given regulatory network generates a particular phenotypic behaviour. Several fundamental gene circuits have been developed using this approach, including toggle switches7 and oscillators8,9,10, and these have been applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development11 and cellular population control12. Here we describe an engineered genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and persistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops1,13. Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single-cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit; almost every cell exhibited large-amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations and allows for greater tunability. Examination of our refined model suggested the existence of a simplified oscillator design without positive feedback, and we construct an oscillator strain confirming this computational prediction."

However, the mechanism for how these opposite astrocyte influences provide appropriate changes in vessel tone within an environment that has dynamic metabolic requirements remains unclear. Here we show that the ability of astrocytes to induce vasodilations over vasoconstrictions relies on the metabolic state of the rat brain tissue. When oxygen availability is lowered and astrocyte calcium concentration is elevated, astrocyte glycolysis and lactate release are maximized. External lactate attenuates transporter-mediated uptake from the extracellular space of prostaglandin E(2), leading to accumulation and subsequent vasodilation. In conditions of low oxygen concentration extracellular adenosine also increases, which blocks astrocyte-mediated constriction, facilitating dilation. These data reveal the role of metabolic substrates in regulating brain blood flow and provide a mechanism for differential astrocyte control over cerebrovascular diameter during different states of brain activation."

https://openalex.org/W2130552692,"The blood-filtering barrier in the glomerulus of the vertebrate kidney, where blood is ultrafiltered to form urine, is made up of modified epithelial cells called podocytes. The nephron — consisting of the glomerulus and renal tubule — is considered a characteristic adaptive feature of vertebrates. But 'nephron-like' features are found in the excretory systems of many invertebrates. Now Weavers et al. report that an insect filtration cell known as the nephrocyte shares striking similarity with the podocyte. Fly orthologues of the major constituents of the slit diaphragm of the kidney form a complex of interacting proteins resembling that found in vertebrates. The nephrocyte diaphragm is completely lost in flies mutant for nephrin or NEPH1 orthologues, similar to the phenotype of the human kidney disease congenital nephrotic syndrome (NPHS1). This establishes the insect nephrocyte as a model for the study of kidney podocyte biology and podocyte-associated diseases. This paper shows that insects possess a structure very similar, both anatomically and functionally, to the blood-filtering tissue of the vertebrate kidney, and raises the possibility that components of the vertebrate excretory system were inherited from their invertebrate ancestors. It is also shown that fly orthologues of the major constituents of the slit diaphragm of the kidney form a complex of interacting proteins similar to the vertebrate slit diaphragm complex. The nephron is the basic structural and functional unit of the vertebrate kidney. It is composed of a glomerulus, the site of ultrafiltration, and a renal tubule, along which the filtrate is modified. Although widely regarded as a vertebrate adaptation1, ‘nephron-like’ features can be found in the excretory systems of many invertebrates, raising the possibility that components of the vertebrate excretory system were inherited from their invertebrate ancestors2. Here we show that the insect nephrocyte has remarkable anatomical, molecular and functional similarity to the glomerular podocyte, a cell in the vertebrate kidney that forms the main size-selective barrier as blood is ultrafiltered to make urine. In particular, both cell types possess a specialized filtration diaphragm, known as the slit diaphragm in podocytes or the nephrocyte diaphragm in nephrocytes. We find that fly (Drosophila melanogaster) orthologues of the major constituents of the slit diaphragm, including nephrin, NEPH1 (also known as KIRREL), CD2AP, ZO-1 (TJP1) and podocin, are expressed in the nephrocyte and form a complex of interacting proteins that closely mirrors the vertebrate slit diaphragm complex. Furthermore, we find that the nephrocyte diaphragm is completely lost in flies lacking the orthologues of nephrin or NEPH1—a phenotype resembling loss of the slit diaphragm in the absence of either nephrin (as in human congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type, NPHS1) or NEPH1. These changes markedly impair filtration function in the nephrocyte. The similarities we describe between invertebrate nephrocytes and vertebrate podocytes provide evidence suggesting that the two cell types are evolutionarily related, and establish the nephrocyte as a simple model in which to study podocyte biology and podocyte-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2123076400,"Background In this study we investigated the association between instrumental music training in childhood and outcomes closely related to music training as well as those more distantly related. Methodology/Principal Findings Children who received at least three years (M = 4.6 years) of instrumental music training outperformed their control counterparts on two outcomes closely related to music (auditory discrimination abilities and fine motor skills) and on two outcomes distantly related to music (vocabulary and nonverbal reasoning skills). Duration of training also predicted these outcomes. Contrary to previous research, instrumental music training was not associated with heightened spatial skills, phonemic awareness, or mathematical abilities. Conclusions/Significance While these results are correlational only, the strong predictive effect of training duration suggests that instrumental music training may enhance auditory discrimination, fine motor skills, vocabulary, and nonverbal reasoning. Alternative explanations for these results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2043476221,"Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli causes severe gastrointestinal disease, in part mediated by subtilase cytotoxin. The B subunit of this toxin is now shown to have high affinity for glycans containing N-glycolylneuraminic acid, a saccharide that is not synthesized by humans. Instead it is ingested as part of the diet, in red meat and dairy products and subsequently incorporated into intestinal and kidney tissue. Ironically, red meat and dairy products, rich sources of N-glycolylneuraminic acid, are also the foods most commonly contaminated with the toxic bacteria. So through dietary choices, humans may both expose themselves to a pathogen and simultaneously become more susceptible to it as their tissues are sensitized to a key virulence factor. Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli causes severe gastrointestinal disease, which is in part mediated by subtilase cytotoxin. The B subunit of this toxin is now shown to have high affinity to glycans containing N-glycolylneuraminic acid, a saccharide that is not synthesized by humans. Instead it is ingested by dietary intake of red meat and dairy products and subsequently incorporated into intestinal and kidney tissue. AB5 toxins comprise an A subunit that corrupts essential eukaryotic cell functions, and pentameric B subunits that direct target-cell uptake after binding surface glycans. Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB) is an AB5 toxin secreted by Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC)1, which causes serious gastrointestinal disease in humans2. SubAB causes haemolytic uraemic syndrome-like pathology in mice3 through SubA-mediated cleavage of BiP/GRP78, an essential endoplasmic reticulum chaperone4. Here we show that SubB has a strong preference for glycans terminating in the sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a monosaccharide not synthesized in humans. Structures of SubB-Neu5Gc complexes revealed the basis for this specificity, and mutagenesis of key SubB residues abrogated in vitro glycan recognition, cell binding and cytotoxicity. SubAB specificity for Neu5Gc was confirmed using mouse tissues with a human-like deficiency of Neu5Gc and human cell lines fed with Neu5Gc. Despite lack of Neu5Gc biosynthesis in humans, assimilation of dietary Neu5Gc creates high-affinity receptors on human gut epithelia and kidney vasculature. This, and the lack of Neu5Gc-containing body fluid competitors in humans, confers susceptibility to the gastrointestinal and systemic toxicities of SubAB. Ironically, foods rich in Neu5Gc are the most common source of STEC contamination. Thus a bacterial toxin's receptor is generated by metabolic incorporation of an exogenous factor derived from food."
https://openalex.org/W1973336682,"Apoptosis of inflammatory cells and their subsequent clearance (efferocytosis) by macrophages (Mphis) are key mechanisms orchestrating successful resolution of inflammation. Although the powerful proinflammatory agents lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) influence rates of inflammatory cell apoptosis, little is known about their effects on efferocytosis. We have demonstrated that LPS and TNF-alpha potently inhibit efferocytosis of neutrophils by monocyte-derived Mphis. Inhibition was both concentration and time dependent, although the effect of TNF-alpha was more rapid. We have found that soluble TNF receptor-I attenuated LPS inhibition of phagocytosis, indicating that TNF-alpha production is critical. Inhibition of efferocytosis by LPS was found to be positively associated with Mphi production of TNF-alpha, but negatively with interleukin-10 (IL-10) release. A critical role for IL-10 in the regulation of phagocytosis was suggested by 2 important findings: LPS inhibition was observed more rapidly in the presence of an anti-human IL-10 receptor-alpha antibody, and efferocytosis by IL-10-deficient Mphis was markedly reduced compared to wild-type Mphis. Furthermore, exogenous IL-10 and glucocorticoids reversed inhibitory effects of LPS on efferocytosis via suppression of TNF-alpha production. We suggest that efferocytosis is regulated in an autocrine manner by pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, and the inflammatory milieu determines whether inflammation successfully resolves."
https://openalex.org/W2155665727,"A dramatic expansion of road building is underway in the Congo Basin fuelled by private enterprise, international aid, and government aspirations. Among the great wilderness areas on earth, the Congo Basin is outstanding for its high biodiversity, particularly mobile megafauna including forest elephants (Loxodonta africana cyclotis). The abundance of many mammal species in the Basin increases with distance from roads due to hunting pressure, but the impacts of road proliferation on the movements of individuals are unknown. We investigated the ranging behaviour of forest elephants in relation to roads and roadless wilderness by fitting GPS telemetry collars onto a sample of 28 forest elephants living in six priority conservation areas. We show that the size of roadless wilderness is a strong determinant of home range size in this species. Though our study sites included the largest wilderness areas in central African forests, none of 4 home range metrics we calculated, including core area, tended toward an asymptote with increasing wilderness size, suggesting that uninhibited ranging in forest elephants no longer exists. Furthermore we show that roads outside protected areas which are not protected from hunting are a formidable barrier to movement while roads inside protected areas are not. Only 1 elephant from our sample crossed an unprotected road. During crossings her mean speed increased 14-fold compared to normal movements. Forest elephants are increasingly confined and constrained by roads across the Congo Basin which is reducing effective habitat availability and isolating populations, significantly threatening long term conservation efforts. If the current road development trajectory continues, forest wildernesses and the forest elephants they contain will collapse."
https://openalex.org/W2088042987,"In this work, we address an important but unexplored topic, namely the neural correlates of hate. In a block-design fMRI study, we scanned 17 normal human subjects while they viewed the face of a person they hated and also faces of acquaintances for whom they had neutral feelings. A hate score was obtained for the object of hate for each subject and this was used as a covariate in a between-subject random effects analysis. Viewing a hated face resulted in increased activity in the medial frontal gyrus, right putamen, bilaterally in premotor cortex, in the frontal pole and bilaterally in the medial insula. We also found three areas where activation correlated linearly with the declared level of hatred, the right insula, right premotor cortex and the right fronto-medial gyrus. One area of deactivation was found in the right superior frontal gyrus. The study thus shows that there is a unique pattern of activity in the brain in the context of hate. Though distinct from the pattern of activity that correlates with romantic love, this pattern nevertheless shares two areas with the latter, namely the putamen and the insula."
https://openalex.org/W2166870479,"In an age of increasing globalization and discussion of the possibility of global pandemics, increasing rates of reporting of these events may influence public perception of risk. The present studies investigate the impact of high levels of media reporting on the perceptions of disease. Undergraduate psychology and medical students were asked to rate the severity, future prevalence and disease status of both frequently reported diseases (e.g. avian flu) and infrequently reported diseases (e.g. yellow fever). Participants considered diseases that occur frequently in the media to be more serious, and have higher disease status than those that infrequently occur in the media, even when the low media frequency conditions were considered objectively ‘worse’ by a separate group of participants. Estimates of severity also positively correlated with popular print media frequency in both student populations. However, we also see that the concurrent presentation of objective information about the diseases can mitigate this effect. It is clear from these data that the media can bias our perceptions of disease."
https://openalex.org/W2097637421,"Activation of GSK-3β is presumed to be involved in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by memory disturbances during early stages of the disease. The normal function of GSK-3β in adult brain is not well understood. Here, we analyzed the ability of heterozygote GSK-3β knockout (GSK+/−) mice to form memories. In the Morris water maze (MWM), learning and memory performance of GSK+/− mice was no different from that of wild-type (WT) mice for the first 3 days of training. With continued learning on subsequent days, however, retrograde amnesia was induced in GSK+/− mice, suggesting that GSK+/− mice might be impaired in their ability to form long-term memories. In contextual fear conditioning (CFC), context memory was normally consolidated in GSK+/− mice, but once the original memory was reactivated, they showed reduced freezing, suggesting that GSK+/− mice had impaired memory reconsolidation. Biochemical analysis showed that GSK-3β was activated after memory reactivation in WT mice. Intraperitoneal injection of a GSK-3 inhibitor before memory reactivation impaired memory reconsolidation in WT mice. These results suggest that memory reconsolidation requires activation of GSK-3β in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W1974357395,"The pneumococcal histidine triad (Pht) proteins are a recently recognized family of surface proteins, comprising 4 members: PhtA, PhtB, PhtD, and PhtE. They are being promoted for inclusion in a multicomponent pneumococcal protein vaccine currently under development, but to date, their biological functions and their relative contributions to pathogenesis have not been clarified. In this study, the involvement of these proteins in pneumococcal virulence was investigated in murine models of sepsis and pneumonia by using defined, nonpolar mutants of the respective genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae D39. In either challenge model, mutagenesis of all 4 genes was required to completely abolish virulence relative to the wild-type, suggesting significant functional redundancy among Pht proteins. The in vivo expression of pht genes was significantly up-regulated in the nasopharynx and lungs compared with blood. We provide unequivocal molecular evidence for Zn(2+)-dependent, AdcR-mediated, regulation of pht gene expression by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. We also present the first direct evidence for the biological function of this protein family by demonstrating that Pht proteins are required for inhibition of complement deposition on the pneumococcal surface through the recruitment of complement factor H."
https://openalex.org/W1972681439,"The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is an ATP-gated cationic channel expressed by hematopoietic, epithelial, and neuronal cells. Prolonged ATP exposure leads to the formation of a nonselective pore, which can result in cell death. We show that P2X7R is associated with detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) in both transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and primary macrophages independently from ATP binding. The DRM association requires the posttranslational modification of P2X7R by palmitic acid. Treatment of cells with the palmitic acid analog 2-bromopalmitate as well as mutations of cysteine to alanine residues abolished P2X7R palmitoylation. Substitution of the 17 intracellular cysteines of P2X7R revealed that 4 regions of the carboxyl terminus domain are involved in palmitoylation. Palmitoylation-defective P2X7R mutants showed a dramatic decrease in cell surface expression because of their retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and proteolytic degradation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that P2X7R palmitoylation plays a critical role in its association with the lipid microdomains of the plasma membrane and in the regulation of its half-life."
https://openalex.org/W2005551003,"Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by decreased interest and engagement in social interactions and by enhanced self-focus. While previous theoretical approaches to understanding autism have emphasized social impairments and altered interpersonal interactions, there is a recent shift towards understanding the nature of the representation of the self in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Still, the neural mechanisms subserving self-representations in ASD are relatively unexplored.We used event-related fMRI to investigate brain responsiveness to images of the subjects' own face and to faces of others. Children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children viewed randomly presented digital morphs between their own face and a gender-matched other face, and made ""self/other"" judgments. Both groups of children activated a right premotor/prefrontal system when identifying images containing a greater percentage of the self face. However, while TD children showed activation of this system during both self- and other-processing, children with ASD only recruited this system while viewing images containing mostly their own face.This functional dissociation between the representation of self versus others points to a potential neural substrate for the characteristic self-focus and decreased social understanding exhibited by these individuals, and suggests that individuals with ASD lack the shared neural representations for self and others that TD children and adults possess and may use to understand others."
https://openalex.org/W2029393322,"Antibodies that inhibit the growth of blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum may play an important role in acquired and vaccine-induced immunity in humans. However, the acquisition and activity of these antibodies is not well understood.We tested dialysed serum and purified immunoglobulins from Kenyan children and adults for inhibition of P. falciparum blood-stage growth in vitro using different parasite lines. Serum antibodies were measured by ELISA to blood-stage parasite antigens, extracted from P. falciparum schizonts, and to recombinant merozoite surface protein 1 (42 kDa C-terminal fragment, MSP1-42).Antibodies to blood-stage antigens present in schizont protein extract and to recombinant MSP1-42 significantly increased with age and were highly correlated. In contrast, growth-inhibitory activity was not strongly associated with age and tended to decline marginally with increasing age and exposure, with young children demonstrating the highest inhibitory activity. Comparison of growth-inhibitory activity among samples collected from the same population at different time points suggested that malaria transmission intensity influenced the level of growth-inhibitory antibodies. Antibodies to recombinant MSP1-42 were not associated with growth inhibition and high immunoglobulin G levels were poorly predictive of inhibitory activity. The level of inhibitory activity against different isolates varied.Children can acquire growth-inhibitory antibodies at a young age, but once they are acquired they do not appear to be boosted by on-going exposure. Inhibitory antibodies may play a role in protection from early childhood malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2045909004,"Recent publications suggest that neoplastic initiation and growth are dependent on a small subset of cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs). Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma (ATC) is a very aggressive solid tumor with poor prognosis, characterized by high dedifferentiation. The existence of CSCs might account for the heterogeneity of ATC lesions. CD133 has been identified as a stem cell marker for normal and cancerous tissues, although its biological function remains unknown.ATC cell lines ARO, KAT-4, KAT-18 and FRO were analyzed for CD133 expression. Flow cytometry showed CD133(pos) cells only in ARO and KAT-4 (64+/-9% and 57+/-12%, respectively). These data were confirmed by qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. ARO and KAT-4 were also positive for fetal marker oncofetal fibronectin and negative for thyrocyte-specific differentiating markers thyroglobulin, thyroperoxidase and sodium/iodide symporter. Sorted ARO/CD133(pos) cells exhibited higher proliferation, self-renewal, colony-forming ability in comparison with ARO/CD133(neg). Furthermore, ARO/CD133(pos) showed levels of thyroid transcription factor TTF-1 similar to the fetal thyroid cell line TAD-2, while the expression in ARO/CD133(neg) was negligible. The expression of the stem cell marker OCT-4 detected by RT-PCR and flow cytometry was markedly higher in ARO/CD133(pos) in comparison to ARO/CD133(neg) cells. The stem cell markers c-KIT and THY-1 were negative. Sensitivity to chemotherapy agents was investigated, showing remarkable resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in ARO/CD133(pos) when compared with ARO/CD133(neg) cells.We describe CD133(pos) cells in ATC cell lines. ARO/CD133(pos) cells exhibit stem cell-like features--such as high proliferation, self-renewal ability, expression of OCT-4--and are characterized by higher resistance to chemotherapy. The simultaneous positivity for thyroid specific factor TTF-1 and onfFN suggest they might represent putative thyroid cancer stem-like cells. Our in vitro findings might provide new insights for novel therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2074647514,"Antibodies that impair Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion and intraerythrocytic development are one of several mechanisms that mediate naturally acquired immunity to malaria. Attempts to correlate anti-malaria antibodies with risk of infection and morbidity have yielded inconsistent results. Growth inhibition assays (GIA) offer a convenient method to quantify functional antibody activity against blood stage malaria.A treatment-time-to-infection study was conducted over 12-weeks in a malaria holoendemic area of Kenya. Plasma collected from healthy individuals (98 children and 99 adults) before artemether-lumefantrine treatment was tested by GIA in three separate laboratories.Median GIA levels varied with P. falciparum line (D10, 8.8%; 3D7, 34.9%; FVO, 51.4% inhibition). The magnitude of growth inhibition decreased with age in all P. falciparum lines tested with the highest median levels among children <4 years compared to adults (e.g. 3D7, 45.4% vs. 30.0% respectively, p = 0.0003). Time-to-infection measured by weekly blood smears was significantly associated with level of GIA controlling for age. Upper quartile inhibition activity was associated with less risk of infection compared to individuals with lower levels (e.g. 3D7, hazard ratio = 1.535, 95% CI = 1.012-2.329; p = 0.0438). Various GIA methodologies had little effect on measured parasite growth inhibition.Plasma antibody-mediated growth inhibition of blood stage P. falciparum decreases with age in residents of a malaria holoendemic area. Growth inhibition assay may be a useful surrogate of protection against infection when outcome is controlled for age."

Several observations have prompted diverse models as to how Tax impairs cellular repair response. Tax represses transcription of DNA polymerase β, an enzyme involved specifically in base excision repair, and base excision repair is suppressed in HTLV-1-transformed cells (15Jeang K.T. Widen S.G.

Tax also suppresses nucleotide excision repair, which correlates with its ability to trans-activate proliferating cell nuclear antigen (17Haoudi A. Semmes O.J. Virology. 2003; 305: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Kao S.Y. Marriott S.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4299-4304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional repression of human telomerase (hTert) by Tax may inhibit the addition of telomeric repeats to stabilize the ends of double-stranded DNA breaks (19Gabet A.S. Mortreux F. Charneau P. Riou P. Duc-Dodon M. Wu Y. Jeang K.T. Wattel E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3734-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, a reduction or loss of expression of two or more mismatch repair genes was observed in primary ATL leukemic cells (20Morimoto H. Tsukada J. Kominato Y. Tanaka Y. Am. J. Hematol. 2005; 78: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that the ability of Tax to induce micronuclei is dependent on Ku86, a component of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway employed for DNA double strand break (DSB) repair (13Majone F. Luisetto R. Zamboni D. Iwanaga Y. Jeang K.T. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Ku86 and Ku70 form the regulatory subunit of DNA-PK, an enzyme with a critical role in NHEJ repair (21Burma S. Chen D.J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We showed previously that Tax interacts with Chk2 (22Haoudi A. Daniels R.C. Wong E. Kupfer G. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37736-37744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), a downstream target of DNA-PK, and subsequently demonstrated Tax-induced impairment of the Chk2-mediated response to exogenous DNA damage (23Gupta S.K.

Collectively, these studies demonstrate the wide-ranging effects that Tax has on the capacity of the cell to respond appropriately to DNA damage. In this study, we have identified a novel physical interaction between Tax and DNA-PK. We show that Tax co-localizes in nuclear speckles with forms of the catalytic subunit of DNA-PK (DNA-PKcs) that are phosphorylated at Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 and that these phosphorylated forms are increased in Tax-expressing cells. Tax is required for formation of a DNA-PK/Chk2 interaction and inhibition of DNA-PK ablated Tax activation of Chk2, implying that DNA-PK mediates this Tax activity. Tax expression alone resulted in increased steady-state levels of phospho-DNA-PKcs and phosphorylated histone 2AX (γ-H2AX). However, the ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) formation and -fold induction of phospho-DNA-PK in response to ionizing radiation (IR) is repressed in the presence of Tax. We provide evidence that Tax elicits its action via physical binding and constitutive stabilization of phosphorylated DNA-PK. Collectively, these data demonstrate that through direct interaction with DNA-PK, Tax subverts a normal cellular DNA damage response by saturation of naive DNA-PK. Plasmids—The S-tagged expression vectors STaxGFP and SGFP were constructed by inserting the tax-EGFP fusion or EGFP open reading frame, respectively, into the SmaI site of pTriEx4-Neo (Novagen, Madison, WI) in-frame with the amino-terminal S-tag and His tag (24Durkin S.S. Ward M.D. Fryrear K.A. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31705-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Tax deletion mutant, STaxΔNLS, was constructed by removing the nuclear localization signal sequence encoding amino acids 29–52. Specifically, the deletion mutation was accomplished using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and employing a forward primer (CAA GGC GAC TGG TGC CAG ATC ACC TGG GAC CCC) and a reverse primer (GGG GTC CCA GGT GAT CTG GCA CCA GTC GCC TTG).

S-tagged Chk2 and HA-tagged Chk2 were used to express the full length of Chk2 (23Gupta S.K. Guo X. Durkin S.S. Fryrear K.F. Ward M.D. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29431-29440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed by standard calcium phosphate precipitation as described elsewhere (22Haoudi A. Daniels R.C. Wong E. Kupfer G. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37736-37744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Isolation of Tax-containing Protein Complexes—S-Tax-GFP expression plasmids were transfected into 293T cells. Cell lysates were incubated with 75-μl bed volume of S-protein-agarose (Novagen, Madison, WI) for 30 min at room temperature and then washed three times with 1 ml of bind/wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). The washed beads were eluted by resuspension in 150 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with β-mercaptoethanol followed by boiling for 5 min. Eluates were separated in a 10% SDS one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel and visualized by SilverQuest silver staining (Invitrogen). Bands of interest were excised manually from the gel for further analysis. Immunoprecipitation—Whole cell lysate containing ∼2 mg of protein in 500 μl was incubated with 5 μl of anti-Tax polyclonal antibody (25Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 4 °C overnight with constant rotation. The lysate was then incubated with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) while rotating for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml each of 1× SNNTE buffer (5% sucrose, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA). Proteins were eluted from beads by resuspension in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) with β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Immunoblot Analysis—Cell extracts were derived as described above. Total protein concentrations were determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). An equal volume of sample loading buffer (Bio-Rad) with β-mercaptoethanol was added to the lysate and boiled for 5 min. Samples were normalized to total protein and separated through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P (Millipore, Billerica, MA) membrane using a Trans-blot SD semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 400 mA for 50 min. After blocking in 5% nonfat milk in PBS/0.1% Tween-20, blots were incubated in primary antibody overnight followed by 1 h of incubation in secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactivity was detected via Immun-Star enhanced chemiluminescence protein detection (Bio-Rad). Liquid Chromatography-MS/MS Analysis—Protein bands were excised from one-dimensional polyacrylamide gels. Gel slices were cut into 1–2-mm cubes, washed three times with 500 μl of ultra-pure water, and incubated in 100% acetonitrile for 45 min. The material was dried in a SpeedVac, rehydrated in a 12.5 ng/μl modified sequencing grade trypsin solution (Promega, Madison, WI), and incubated in an ice bath for 40–45 min. The excess trypsin solution was then removed and replaced with 40–50 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 10% acetonitrile, pH 8.0, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted twice with 25 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid and dried in a SpeedVac. Digests were resuspended in 20 μl of Buffer A (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid), and 3–6 μl was loaded onto a 12-cm × 0.075-mm fused silica capillary column packed with 5 μm diameter C-18 beads (The Nest Group, Southboro, MA). Peptides were eluted for 55 min by applying a 0–80% linear gradient of Buffer B (95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid) at a flow rate of 130 μl/min with a pre-column flow splitter, resulting in a final flow rate of ∼200 nL/min directly into the source. A ThermoFinnigan LCQ™ Deca XP (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) was run in an automated collection mode with an instrument method composed of a single segment and four data-dependent scan events with a full MS scan followed by three MS/MS scans of the highest intensity ions. Normalized collision energy was set at 30, and activation Q was 0.250, with minimum full scan signal intensity at 5 × 105 and a minimum MS2 intensity at 1 × 104. Dynamic exclusion was turned on utilizing a 3-min repeat count of 2, with the mass width set at 1.50 Da. Sequence analysis was performed with TurboSEQUEST™ (Thermo Scientific) using an indexed human subset data base of the nonredundant protein data base from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Web site. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells transfected with Hpx Tax expression vector or mock-transfected by harvesting in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by chloroform extraction. The aqueous layer was transferred to a fresh tube with isopropanol, and the mixture was applied to an RNeasy column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNase-free DNase was added to the wash buffer, and RNA was eluted with RNase-free water. Gene expression was measured using the Access RT-PCR system (Promega) for coupled reverse transcription and PCR amplification according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 10 ng of RNA template was reverse-transcribed using AMV reverse transcriptase for first strand cDNA synthesis and Tfl DNA polymerase for second strand cDNA synthesis and DNA amplification. 18S rRNA was amplified as an internal control for equal total RNA using primers 5′-TGACTCTAGATAACCTCGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCAAGATCCAACTACGAGC-3′ (reverse). A 348 bp fragment of DNA-PKcs cDNA (3325–3672 bp) was amplified using primers 5′-AGGGAAGAAGAGTCTCTGGTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATTAGGGGATCTGTTGCCTGGC-3′ (reverse). Semiquantitation was achieved by limiting dilution of products. Immunofluorescence—Cells were seeded onto 22-mm-diameter coverslips in 6-well plates at 1 × 105 cells/well. Transfections were performed as described above, and 48 h later cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with methanol. Coverslips were incubated with primary antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS overnight at 4 °C followed by two washes in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 and two washes in PBS. Coverslips were then incubated in secondary antibody with the addition of 1 μm TOPRO-3-iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature followed by two washes in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS and two washes in PBS. Coverslips were then mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope at ×40 magnification with a 2.8× zoom and imaged with Image Browser software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Nuclear Extracts—Confluent 150-mm plates of transfected 293T cells were washed twice in cold PBS and harvested by scraping in 3 ml of Buffer C (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were allowed to lyse by incubation for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and 1 ml of Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture) was added to the pellet. The resuspended pellet was incubated on ice for 30 min and mixed gently every 5 min by pipetting up and down. The sample was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against Buffer E (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 5 h to overnight at 4 °C. Nuclear extracts were stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Chromatin-bound Fraction—Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and fractionated into soluble cytoplasmic, soluble nuclear, and chromatin-bound fractions as described in our previous study (23Gupta S.K. Guo X. Durkin S.S. Fryrear K.F. Ward M.D. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29431-29440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The final chromatin pellet was resuspended in M-Per protein lysis buffer by pulling the sample through a 21-gauge needle for 10 times to break the protein-DNA binding. The chromatin-bound proteins (P3) were collected by further centrifugation (10 min, 12,000 × g). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay as described above. DNA-dependent Protein Kinase Assay—Protein kinase activity was assayed using the SignaTECT® DNA-dependent protein kinase assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. In some reactions, extracts were preincubated with 10 μm DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026 (Calbiochem) for 1 h on ice before being added to the reaction. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Termination buffer containing guanidine hydrochloride was then added, and 10 μl of each reaction mixture was spotted onto SAM2® biotin capture membrane, containing biotin-binding streptavidin matrix. After washing with 2 m NaCl, membranes were dried, and incorporated 32P-phosphorylated substrate was measured by scintillation counting. Chk2 Kinase Assay—pCDNA4-Chk2 in combination with pCDNA3-Tax (provided by Ralph Grassmann, Institute for Clinical Virology, Erlangen, Germany) or control plasmid expressing nonspecific protein was subjected to in vitro transcription/translation using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Standard 50-μl reactions were performed following the manufacturer's protocol. 8 μl of the in vitro translation product was mixed with 300 μl of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for immunoprecipitation using 2 μg of anti-Xpress tag antibody (Invitrogen) for 3 h. Precipitates were washed twice with NETN buffer lacking protease inhibitors followed by a final wash with 1× kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). In some reactions, precipitated Chk2 immune complexes were preincubated with 10 μm DNA-PK inhibitor II (Calbiochem) for 1 h on ice before being added to the kinase reaction. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in 1× kinase assay buffer supplemented with 2 μm unlabeled ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Pierce). The reaction mixture was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, dried, and subjected to phosphorimaging using a Typhoon scanner (GE Healthcare). Relative intensity of the bands was calculated by densitometry. Identification of DNA-PK in Cellular Tax Complexes—We previously described a tandem affinity-tagged Tax expression system and demonstrated the expression of biologically active full-length Tax protein fused to amino-terminal S-tags to facilitate affinity purification, and carboxyl-terminal GFP to enable monitoring of protein expression (24Durkin S.S. Ward M.D. Fryrear K.A. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31705-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the current study, we purified S-tagged Tax protein along with interacting cellular factors and resolved these protein complexes by SDS-PAGE and visualization by silver staining (Fig. 1A). Individual bands corresponding to proteins that interact with Tax were excised from the gel, and the proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis. S-Tax-GFP was identified from a band of the expected size on the gel, as indicated (Fig. 1A). In addition, a high molecular weight protein that specifically bound Tax was identified as DNA-PKcs. The S peptide-binding protein EIF4 was also identified. The remaining bands were identified as degraded forms of S-Tax-GFP. The sequence identification was confirmed by resolving replicate samples on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibody specific to DNA-PKcs (Fig. 1B). As an orthogonal approach to confirmation of the Tax/DNA-PK interaction, we conducted co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Tax antibody. Tax complexes were immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates with anti-Tax antibody, and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-DNA-PKcs antibody revealed that DNA-PKcs is specifically present in the Tax complex (Fig. 1C). DNA-PKcs could not be detected when an equal concentration of control anti-GFP antibody was substituted for Tax antibody or when S-GFP was substituted for Tax in the whole cell lysate, substantiating the specificity of the Tax/DNA-PKcs interaction. The DNA-PK holoenzyme consists of a catalytic subunit as well as two regulatory subunits, Ku70 and Ku86 (26Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 27Doherty A.J. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R920-R924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In our co-immunoprecipitation experiments we demonstrated that Ku70 is isolated from Tax-expressing cells with anti-Tax antibody, indicating that the Ku70 regulatory subunit of DNA-PK is also in the Tax complex (Fig. 1D). Similar experiments were conducted to ascertain the presence of Ku86, but we were unable to demonstrate the presence of Ku86 in the Tax complex (data not shown). Thus, the DNA-PK catalytic subunit and at least one regulatory subunit are in a complex with Tax protein. Induction of Phosphorylated DNA-PK by Tax—The activation of DNA-PK occurs at the initial stages of DNA damage recognition (28Yang J. Yu Y. Hamrick H.E. Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 is a critical autophosphorylation event required for kinase activity and repair activity in vivo (29Chan D.W.

Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10842-10852Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Tax did not alter steady-state levels of endogenous DNA-PK RNA as measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). In addition, immunoblot analysis showed that the steady-state levels of native DNA-PKcs protein were unaffected by Tax (Fig. 2B). However, when we assessed phosphorylated forms of DNA-PKcs in the presence of Tax, we observed a dramatic increase in steady-state levels (Fig. 2B). Thus, phosphorylation of endogenous DNA-PK at Ser-2056 and Thr-2609 resulted from the expression of Tax alone without external DNA damage agents. Furthermore, these phosphorylated forms of DNA-PK co-localized with Tax in nuclear structures, which we have previously termed Tax speckled structures (TSS) (25Semmes O.J. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated DNA-PK is present in characteristic nuclear foci only in the Tax-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). Collectively, data from immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments demonstrate that Tax induces the phosphorylated form of DNA-PKcs and, specifically, interacts with it at discrete nuclear foci. Tax Activation of DNA-PK Kinase Activity—A critical activity of DNA-PK is its ability to initiate signal cascades via its selective kinase function. Our observation that Tax expression resulted in an increase in the phosphorylated form of DNA-PK is consistent with activation of the protein as a kinase. However, we wanted to directly confirm that Tax expression resulted in enhanced DNA-PK activity. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we clearly showed that in the presence of Tax, DNA-PK displayed increased kinase activity (Fig. 3A). This assay measures phosphorylation of a p53 peptide substrate that is a known target of DNA-PK. The specificity of the assay for DNA-PK is demonstrated by the loss of kinase activity in the presence of the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026 (Fig. 3A). This inhibitor has an IC50 for DNA-PK that is 500-fold lower than ATM/ATR and 50-fold lower than all other phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, and it has no effect on Chk2 (32Veuger S.J. Curtin N.J. Richardson C.J. Smith G.C. Durkacz B.W. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6008-6015PubMed Google Scholar). One of the known endogenous phosphorylation targets of DNA-PK is the DNA damage response protein Chk2, in which DNA-PK mediates phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr-68 in response to DNA damage (33Li J. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our laboratory and others have shown that Tax interacts with Chk2 (22Haoudi A.

Brady J.N. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 438-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and increases its kinase activity (23Gupta S.K. Guo X. Durkin S.S. Fryrear K.F. Ward M.D. Semmes O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29431-29440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine the role of DNA-PK in mediating Tax activation of Chk2, we measured the in vitro kinase activity of Chk2. The basal activity of Chk2 in rabbit reticulocyte lysates has been attributed previously to the presence of DNA-PK (33Li J. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12041-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Using this system we observed a decrease in Tax-induced Chk2 activation in the presence of the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026 (Fig. 3B). These data establish that activation of DNA-PK in Tax-expressing cells is sufficient for the observed increase in Chk2 kinase activity. Tax Expression Is Coincident with DNA-PK Phosphorylation and"
https://openalex.org/W2138943587,"Fluid and effective social communication requires that both face identity and emotional expression information are encoded and maintained in visual short-term memory (VSTM) to enable a coherent, ongoing picture of the world and its players. This appears to be of particular evolutionary importance when confronted with potentially threatening displays of emotion - previous research has shown better VSTM for angry versus happy or neutral face identities.Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, here we investigated the neural correlates of this angry face benefit in VSTM. Participants were shown between one and four to-be-remembered angry, happy, or neutral faces, and after a short retention delay they stated whether a single probe face had been present or not in the previous display. All faces in any one display expressed the same emotion, and the task required memory for face identity. We find enhanced VSTM for angry face identities and describe the right hemisphere brain network underpinning this effect, which involves the globus pallidus, superior temporal sulcus, and frontal lobe. Increased activity in the globus pallidus was significantly correlated with the angry benefit in VSTM. Areas modulated by emotion were distinct from those modulated by memory load.Our results provide evidence for a key role of the basal ganglia as an interface between emotion and cognition, supported by a frontal, temporal, and occipital network."

https://openalex.org/W2064735508,"Organotins are highly toxic and widely distributed environmental chemicals. Dibutyltin (DBT) is used as stabilizer in the production of polyvinyl chloride plastics, and it is also the major metabolite formed from tributyltin (TBT) in vivo. DBT is immunotoxic, however, the responsible targets remain to be defined. Due to the importance of glucocorticoids in immune-modulation, we investigated whether DBT could interfere with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function.We used HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with human GR as well as rat H4IIE hepatoma cells and native human macrophages and human THP-1 macrophages expressing endogenous receptor to study organotin effects on GR function. Docking of organotins was used to investigate the binding mechanism.We found that nanomolar concentrations of DBT, but not other organotins tested, inhibit ligand binding to GR and its transcriptional activity. Docking analysis indicated that DBT inhibits GR activation allosterically by inserting into a site close to the steroid-binding pocket, which disrupts a key interaction between the A-ring of the glucocorticoid and the GR. DBT inhibited glucocorticoid-induced expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and tyrosine-aminotransferase (TAT) and abolished the glucocorticoid-mediated transrepression of TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity. Moreover, DBT abrogated the glucocorticoid-mediated suppression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-alpha production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated native human macrophages and human THP-1 macrophages.DBT inhibits ligand binding to GR and subsequent activation of the receptor. By blocking GR activation, DBT may disturb metabolic functions and modulation of the immune system, providing an explanation for some of the toxic effects of this organotin."
https://openalex.org/W1987453669,"Cold acclimation in woody plants may have special features compared to similar processes in herbaceous plants. Recent studies have shown that circadian clock behavior in the chestnut tree (Castanea sativa) is disrupted by cold temperatures and that the primary oscillator feedback loop is not functional at 4°C or in winter. In these conditions, CsTOC1 and CsLHY genes are constantly expressed. Here, we show that this alteration also affects CsPRR5, CsPRR7 and CsPRR9. These genes are homologous to the corresponding Arabidopsis PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR genes, which are also components of the circadian oscillator feedback network. The practically constant presence of mRNAs of the 5 chestnut genes at low temperature reveals an unknown aspect of clock regulation and suggests a mechanism regulating the transcription of oscillator genes as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W2042996498,"Histone proteins contain epigenetic information that is encoded both in the relative abundance of core histones and variants and particularly in the post-translational modification of these proteins. We determined the presence of such variants and covalent modifications in seven tissue types of the anuran Xenopus laevis, including oocyte, egg, sperm, early embryo equivalent (pronuclei incubated in egg extract), S3 neurula cells, A6 kidney cells, and erythrocytes. We first developed a new robust method for isolating the stored, predeposition histones from oocytes and eggs via chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, whereas we isolated chromatinized histones via conventional acid extraction. We identified two previously unknown H1 isoforms (H1fx and H1B.Sp) present on sperm chromatin. We immunoblotted this global collection of histones with many specific post-translational modification antibodies, including antibodies against methylated histone H3 on Lys4, Lys9, Lys27, Lys79, Arg2, Arg17, and Arg26; methylated histone H4 on Lys20; methylated H2A and H4 on Arg3; acetylated H4 on Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, and Lys16 and H3 on Lys9 and Lys14; and phosphorylated H3 on Ser10 and H2A/H4 on Ser1. Furthermore, we subjected a subset of these histones to two-dimensional gel analysis and subsequent immunoblotting and mass spectrometry to determine the global remodeling of histone modifications that occurs as development proceeds. Overall, our observations suggest that each metazoan cell type may have a unique histone modification signature correlated with its differentiation status. Histone proteins contain epigenetic information that is encoded both in the relative abundance of core histones and variants and particularly in the post-translational modification of these proteins.

We immunoblotted this global collection of histones with many specific post-translational modification antibodies, including antibodies against methylated histone H3 on Lys4, Lys9, Lys27, Lys79, Arg2, Arg17, and Arg26; methylated histone H4 on Lys20; methylated H2A and H4 on Arg3; acetylated H4 on Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, and Lys16 and H3 on Lys9 and Lys14; and phosphorylated H3 on Ser10 and H2A/H4 on Ser1. Furthermore, we subjected a subset of these histones to two-dimensional gel analysis and subsequent immunoblotting and mass spectrometry to determine the global remodeling of histone modifications that occurs as development proceeds. Overall, our observations suggest that each metazoan cell type may have a unique histone modification signature correlated with its differentiation status. The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, composed of DNA wrapped around an octamer of two copies of each of the four core histones. The histone proteins are subject to a wide range of post-translational modifications, including, but not limited to, acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitylation. These modifications are hypothesized to constitute a “histone code” that promotes or inhibits all of the chromosomal transactions that occur in the cell (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). Variant histone proteins, found in a subset of nucleosomes, provide additional complexity to the code (2Malik H.S. Henikoff S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 882-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 3Bernstein E. Hake S.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 84: 505-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The modifications and variants at a particular chromosomal locus putatively function by recruiting or repelling, in a multivalent fashion, specific activators or repressors, chromatin remodelers, and other proteins (4Ruthenburg A. Li H. Patel D. Allis C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 5Taverna S. Li H. Ruthenburg A. Allis C. Patel D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Post-translational covalent histone modifications have been identified in many organisms with a variety of techniques, including chromatography and spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (6Garcia B. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2007; 11: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and specific antibody detection (7Lin R. Leone J.W. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 8Turner B. Fellows G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Many of the modifications have been strongly correlated with specific cellular functions, including transcriptional activation (e.g. H3K4 methylation, H3 and H4 lysine acetylation, and H2B ubiquitylation) (9Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar), transcriptional elongation (H3K36 methylation), transcriptional repression (H3K9 methylation, H3K27 methylation, H4K20 methylation, and H2A ubiquitylation) (10Czermin B. Imhof A. Genetica. 2003; 117: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and cell cycle progression (H4K20 monomethylation, H2A/H4S1 phosphorylation) (11Huen M. Sy S. van Deursen J. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11073-11077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Barber C.M. Turner F.B. Wang Y. Hagstrom K. Taverna S.D. Mollah S. Ueberheide B. Meyer B.J. Hunt D.F. Cheung P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 2004; 112: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Dynamic changes in these modifications can occur on individual gene loci and genome-wide but in a particular cell type may be strongly correlated with the overall genetic activity of that cell. Many studies have recently observed a few histone modifications in a genome-wide view using new chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques coupled in-line with high-throughput DNA sequencing to determine the specific genomic location of those modifications (13Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E. Wang Z. Wei G. Chepelev I. Zhao K. Cell. 2007; 129: 823-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated how different the histone variant and modification profile is at different genomic loci within the same cell type. The maturing Xenopus oocyte and laid egg have an accumulated store of nonchromatinized, predeposition histones complexed with chaperones, including nucleoplasmin (H2A and H2B) and N1 (H3 and H4) (14Kleinschmidt J.A. Seiter A. Zentgraf H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Zucker K. Worcel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14487-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H4 has been shown in many species, including Xenopus, to be acetylated on Lys5 and Lys12 prior to deposition during S-phase (16Allis C.D. Chicoine L.G. Richman R. Schulman I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8048-8052Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); the role of these modifications is still unknown. The store of histones in the egg has been hypothesized to be required for the rapid cell cycles in the developing frog prior to the midblastula transition (17Almouzni G. Méchali M. Wolffe A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). At the midblastula transition, zygotic transcription starts, and the cell cycles slow down with the acquisition of gap phases and a longer S-phase (18Maller J. Gross S. Schwab M. Finkielstein C. Taieb F. Qian Y. Novartis Found Symp. 2001; 237: 58-73PubMed Google Scholar). Early evidence suggested that there is an adequate store of histones in the egg to complete the exponential increase in chromatin during the 12 cell cycles prior to the midblastula transition (19Woodland H. FEBS Lett. 1980; 121: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Adamson E. Woodland H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 263-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Laskey R. Mills A. Morris N. Cell. 1977; 10: 237-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, histone transcripts do exist in the egg and early embryo (22Ruderman J. Woodland H. Sturgess E. Dev. Biol. 1979; 71: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and histone translation does occur (23Funabiki H. Murray A. Cell. 2000; 102: 411-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein store may not be the entire complement of histones that is used. Furthermore, other than the preexisting H4 acetylation (24Woodland H. Dev. Biol. 1979; 68: 360-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), no other modifications have been demonstrated on the stored histones in Xenopus eggs. We do note that H3K9me was observed on pre-deposited histones in cultured mammalian cells (25Loyola A. Bonaldi T. Roche D. Imhof A. Almouzni G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 309-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), suggesting that there are likely to be a variety of modifications present on histones prior to chromatin assembly that may play a role in potentiating an epigenetic state. Considering the range of different histone variants and modifications that have been discovered, we hypothesized that different cell types may have their own global index of histone modification enrichments in total. We also were interested in analyzing the histone modification and variant transitions during remodeling of the early embryo. Therefore, we isolated histones from seven distinct cell types of the frog Xenopus laevis, including stored oocyte, stored egg, sperm, early embryo equivalent (pronuclei incubated in egg extract), S3 tissue culture cells (derived from a neurula explant), A6 tissue culture cells (derived from an adult kidney), and the nucleated, terminally differentiated, and completely silenced erythrocytes of the adult frog (26Gilbert N. Boyle S. Sutherland H. de Las Heras J. Allan J. Jenuwein T. Bickmore W.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5540-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We subjected these histone proteins to a variety of analyses, including immunoblotting with specific post-translational modification antibodies (this paper) and high resolution mass spectrometry (see accompanying article (45Nicklay J.J. Shechter D. Chitta R.K. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Allis C.D. Hunt D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1075-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). The isolation procedure for the stored egg histones described in the literature utilized a guanidine/alcohol precipitation step that only had a historical basis for its application (20Adamson E. Woodland H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 263-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 27Adamson E. Woodland H. Dev. Biol. 1977; 57: 136-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Woodland H.R. Adamson E.D. Dev. Biol. 1977; 57: 118-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); furthermore, there was no evidence presented that the entire complement of histones was actually isolated. Therefore, we developed a new approach for the stored histone isolation (in both oocytes and eggs) that we present here. We finally conclude with a summary of the modification index and the transitions that occur from oocyte, egg, and sperm through the early embryo. Extract Preparation—Xenopus interphase egg extract was prepared as described (29Shechter D. Costanzo V. Gautier J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 648-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Clarified egg extract was prepared from low speed supernatant that was spun in an SW-55 rotor at 50,000 rpm × 2 h. The clarified middle layer was removed and respun for 30 min, and glycerol was added to 5%, aliquoted, and flash frozen. Xenopus oocyte extracts were prepared from freshly dissected ovaries by disrupting the follicular layer with a 3-h digestion with Dispase II (40 mg/100 ml) at room temperature, followed by a 1-h digestion with collagenase (50 mg/100 ml), all in 1× Merriam's buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 88 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 1 mm KCl, 0.41 mm CaCl2, and 0.82 mm MgSO4). The defolliculated oocytes were then washed extensively with 1× Merriam's containing 200 mm sucrose and 1 mm DTT, 2The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatograph; PTM, post-translational modification. and the later staged oocytes settled to the bottom (the less dense stage I and II oocytes were mostly lost during the preparation). The oocytes were settled in 13 × 51-mm Beckman ultracentrifuge tubes, and excess buffer was removed. They were then spin-crushed at 35,000 rpm (150,000 × g) for 40 min in an SW-55 rotor. The middle layer was removed with a pipette and respun for 30 min. The middle layer was again removed, glycerol was added to 5% final, and the extract was aliquoted and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pronuclei (Early Embryo Equivalent) Preparation and Chromatin Isolation—Pronuclei were prepared by swelling 12,000/μl demembranated sperm chromatin in 2 ml of interphase egg extract until mid-to-late S-phase, (determined by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and microscopy showing the appearance of rounded, large, membranated nuclei with recondensing chromatin). The suspension was raised to 10 ml total with ELB-CIB buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm spermidine, 1 mm spermine, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1× phosphatase inhibitors, and 1× protease inhibitors), mixed, and incubated on ice for 10 min. The chromatin was isolated via centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min through a 1-ml sucrose cushion of ELB-CIB with 0.5 m sucrose underlayered in the tube. The pellet was washed once with ELB-CIB plus 250 mm KCl. Erythrocyte Preparation—Five frogs were sacrificed and bled into an ice-cold solution of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, and 5 mm EDTA (30Humphries S. Young D. Carroll D. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3223-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The blood-containing suspension was filtered through 10 layers of cheesecloth and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was washed twice with Buffer X (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 80 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2,1 mm EDTA) with added 0.2 m sucrose and protease inhibitors (Roche Complete) and spun at 4000 rpm for 10 min in a tabletop swinging bucket centrifuge. The pellet was then resuspended in a low salt/hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm sodium butyrate, phosphatase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors. The suspension was pipeted up and down on ice for 10 min and then layered over 2 ml of Buffer X with 0.5 m sucrose and 0.03% bovine serum albumin. This was spun at 4000 rpm for 10 min in a tabletop swinging bucket centrifuge and repeated over Buffer X with 1 m sucrose; white nuclei remain (the red hemoglobin was in the supernatant at this point, indicating complete lysis of the cells). The erythrocyte nuclei were spun at 14,000 rpm × 1 min, and the supernatant was removed and resuspended in Buffer X plus 0.5 m sucrose and 0.3% bovine serum albumin, protease inhibitors, 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 1 mm DTT. The nuclei were counted, aliquoted, and flash frozen. Tissue Culture—Xenopus S3 and A6 tissue culture cells were grown in 60% Liebowitz L15 medium with 10% FBS at room temperature in a laboratory drawer according to standard tissue culture techniques. Histone Isolation—Histones from sperm chromatin, S3 and A6 tissue culture cells, and erythrocyte chromatin were collected and isolated in the presence of 10 mm sodium butyrate and acid-extracted as described (31Shechter D. Dormann H. Allis C. Hake S. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Pronuclei were isolated from egg extract as described above, washed with 300 mm NaCl, and acid-extracted. Stored histones from oocyte and egg extracts were purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose. 1 g of heparin-Sepharose CL-6B dry resin (catalog number 17-0467-01; GE Healthcare) was swollen and washed in Buffer H (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA). 3 ml of swollen resin was collected, and 3 ml of clarified egg or oocyte extract, containing fresh 10 mm sodium butyrate, phosphatase inhibitor mixtures, and protease inhibitor mixture, was applied in “batch” form. 20 ml of additional Buffer H was added. The tube containing the resin and extract was rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, and then the suspension was spun down at 4000 rpm for 4 min. The supernatant (flow-through) was collected, and then the resin was washed 4 times with 50 ml of buffer H with inhibitors, followed by transfer to a disposable plastic column. The resin was then washed with 30 ml of buffer H plus 0.1 m NaCl and then 30 ml of buffer H plus 0.5 m NaCl. The histones were then eluted from the heparin-Sepharose with 15 ml of buffer H plus 2 m NaCl. The eluent was diluted to 40 ml with H2O, and 10 ml of 100% trichloroacetic acid was added to 25% final concentration (w/v), and the tube was incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspension of precipitated histones was spun in an SS34 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The precipitate was washed twice with 100% ice-cold acetone and then briefly air-dried. The histones were dissolved in 1 ml of H2O and used for subsequent analysis. Immunoblotting—Histones were run on homemade 17% (37.5:1 acrylamide/bis) 0.75-mm-thick SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) using 1× NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen). Membranes were stained using Direct Blue 71 stain to ensure proper transfer; any membranes with inadequate or uneven transfer were discarded. Membranes were blocked in 1% ECL Advance blocking agent (GE Healthcare) and blotted with antibodies from Millipore and Abcam (listed below). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies were applied and then visualized using ECL Advance, with images captured using the Fuji LAS-3000 digital system. Images were incrementally exposed until CCD saturation, and the exposure before saturation was used for analysis. Images were aligned with molecular weight markers by simultaneous capture of the lit membrane and subsequently cropped, and levels were adjusted for contrast in Adobe Photoshop; no exposed bands were eliminated upon adjustment. One immunoblot was performed for each modification. The antibodies used from Millipore (formerly Upstate) were as follows: H2A (07-146), H2A.Z (07-594), H4 (07-108), H3K4me1 (07-436), H3K4me2 (05-684), H3K4me3 (07-473), H3K9me1 (07-450), H3K9me2 (07-212), H3K9me3 (07-523), H3K27me1 (07-448), H3K27me2 (07-322), H3K27me3 (05-851), H3K79me2 (07-366), H4K79me2 (05-734), H4K20me1 (07-440), H4K20me2 (07-747), H4K20me3 (07-463), H4K5ac (06-759), H4K8ac (06-760), H4K12ac (06-761), H4K16ac (06-762), H3ac (06-599), H3K9ac (06-342), H3K14ac (06-911), H4R3me2a (07-213), H4cit3 (07-596), H3R2me2a (05-808), H3R26me2a (07-215), H2A/H4S1ph (07-179), and H3S10ph (05-817). The antibodies from Abcam were H3 (ab1791) and H4R3me2s (ab5823). Two-dimensional Gel Analysis—Purified histones were run on a two-dimensional Triton-acid urea/SDS gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride as described (31Shechter D. Dormann H. Allis C. Hake S. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Gel Slices—Coomassie-stained gel bands of interest were excised and digested with trypsin, as previously described (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Following enzymatic digestion, peptides were extracted, dried down completely, and stored at -35 °C prior to analysis. Peptides were resuspended in 0.1% acetic acid and loaded onto fused silica microcapillary pre-columns (360 × 75 μm, outer diameter × inner diameter; Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) packed with 8–10 cm of irregular 5–20 μm C18 beads (YMC, Kyoto, Japan). The precolumn was washed with 0.1% acetic acid for 15 min at 500 p.s.i. and then connected via a Teflon sleeve (0.060 × 0.012 inch, outer diameter × inner diameter; Zeus Industrial Products, Orangeburg, SC) to a microcapillary analytical column (360 × 50 μm, outer diameter × inner diameter) packed with 6–8 cm of regular 5 μm C18 beads and equipped with a laser-pulled (P-2000; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) electrospray emitter tip (2–5 μm in diameter). Peptides were gradient-eluted into a Thermo Electron LTQ-Orbitrap utilizing an Agilent 1100 series HPLC (Palo Alto, CA) with a gradient of 0–60% B in 60 min, 60–100% B in 3 min, and held at 100% B for 4 min (A = 0.1% acetic acid; B = 70% aceto-nitrile in 0.1% acetic acid). Mass spectrometry data were searched against a data base of Xenopus and human proteins (for detection of contamination and for completeness, since not all Xenopus protein sequences are archived) from the nonredundant data base from NCBI utilizing the Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm. collisionally associated dissociation spectra of peptides from proteins receiving at least two search hits were manually inspected and verified. We initially wanted to examine the stored histones in the Xenopus egg and oocyte, known to be complexed with the chaperones nucleoplasmin and N1. The published procedure of guanidine/alcohol precipitation (20Adamson E. Woodland H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 88: 263-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) did not lead to an appreciable enrichment of histones in our hands (data not shown); nor did acidifying the extract and collecting the remaining soluble material (data not shown). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of the chaperone nucleoplasmin did not enrich a significant mass of histones (data not shown), consistent with published reports (33Dilworth S. Black S. Laskey R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1009-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Conventional ion exchange chromatography resolves the histones into a variety of subpopulations (15Zucker K. Worcel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14487-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which would complicate subsequent analysis. Therefore, we applied crude oocyte and egg extracts to heparin-Sepharose (previously utilized to separate histones (34Schmiedeke T.M. Stockl F.W. Weber R. Sugisaki Y. Batsford S.R. Vogt A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1879-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)), a highly negatively charged matrix that mimics the electrostatics of DNA, the native partner of histones (Fig. 1a shows a schematic of isolation of histones from a variety of native sources). Fig. 1b shows the highly enriched elution of all four core histones from the heparin-Sepharose in 2 m NaCl (Fig. 1 only shows purified egg histones, but oocyte histones behaved identically). These histones are nonchromatinized, predeposition histones. In Fig. 1c, Western blotting with antibodies against H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 show that the histone population is largely retained on the resin until complete elution with high salt, since no histones remained on the resin. Some H2B did not bind to the heparin Sepharose, as seen in Fig. 1c. Also note that the antibodies against histones H2A and especially H4 did not recognize any protein in the crude extract but did recognize the purified protein. We have consistently observed this lack of H4 antibody binding in crude extracts. 3D. Shechter, unpublished observation. The eluted histones were precipitated and redissolved into water and used for subsequent analysis. Based on the HPLC traces from the purified histones, equivalent amounts of all four core histones were present in the oocyte and egg heparin fractions (Fig. 1 in Ref. 45Nicklay J.J. Shechter D. Chitta R.K. Garcia B.A. Shabanowitz J. Allis C.D. Hunt D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1075-1085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We also isolated histones from pronuclei assembled in interphase egg extract from sperm chromatin. We incubated demembranated sperm chromatin in low speed supernatant of Xenopus eggs until mid-S-phase (as determined by the 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained appearance of the nuclei) and isolated the chromatin through a sucrose cushion. We then used conventional acid extraction to isolate those histones from the pelleted chromatin (Fig. 1D, lane 2). We have denoted these as “early embryo equivalent” histones, since that concentration of pronuclei is equivalent to the DNA/cytoplasm ratio at or before the midblastula transition. Fig. 1d (lane 1) shows the acid-extracted histones from sperm chromatin before incubation in egg extract. The remodeling of chromatin-bound proteins promoted by incubation of sperm chromatin and also of erythrocyte chromatin in egg extract was dramatic, as illustrated by the Coomassie-stained gel of the proteins acid-extracted from the chromatin (Fig. 1, d and e). Therefore, we identified a number of the proteins present on the remodeled chromatin by mass spectrometry, as tabulated in Fig. 1f. Remarkably, the more physiological embryonic pronuclei produced by incubation of sperm chromatin, and the exogenous addition of terminally differentiated erythrocyte nuclei resulted in an almost identical deposition of proteins (as apparent in the Coomassie-stained bands). This is consistent with the known ability of the Xenopus egg extract in reprogramming somatic nuclei. The identified proteins that are not present in the sperm sample alone but are observed upon remodeling of the sperm in egg extract include a variety of maternal (egg) factors that are necessary for a variety of cellular processes, including the embryonic histone H1 variant (B4), high mobility group proteins that are involved in remodeling chromatin, DNA replication factors (replication factor C and proliferating cell nuclear antigen), and the maternal histone chaperone nucleoplasmin (Fig. 1f). In Fig. 1d, we also highlight the presence of a previously unidentified Xenopus sperm-specific linker histone H1-variant annotated as “H1fx” in the NCBI data base (GI # 83318207), with about 50% homology to mammalian H1x protein (supplemental Fig. S1). H1x is an H1-variant that appears to be present in chromatin inaccessible to micrococcal nuclease, although very little is known about it (35Happel N. Schulze E. Doenecke D. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We also identified the sperm-specific basic protein 4, as determined by mass spectrometry of the gel slices. Intriguingly, there is some evidence that sperm-specific basic proteins are related to the H1x family of proteins (36Frehlick L. Prado A. Calestagne-Morelli A. Ausió J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12700-12708Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These two proteins are rapidly lost from decondensing sperm pronuclei in egg extract. We also isolated histones from two Xenopus cultured cell lines, one derived from a neurula explant (S3 cells) and one from adult kidney (A6), as well as from the nucleated erythrocytes of an adult frog. In total, these tissues (oocyte, egg, sperm, early embryo pronuclei, S3, A6, and erythrocyte) give a life span representation of cell types of the frog. The isolated histones were evenly loaded on gels and then Coomassie-stained (Fig. 2a). We then immunoblotted these samples for the core histones H2A, H3, and H4 and for the H2A variant H2A.Z (Fig. 2b). Note that although H3 and H4 are evenly represented among the tissue types, H2B abundance is substantially decreased in the sperm, and a number of variants of H2A are apparent, including a doublet in the oocyte, egg, and early embryo samples. The slightly higher molecular weight H2A isoform is an embryo-specific H2A.X. 4D. Shechter, R. K. Chitta, J. Shabanowitz, D. F. Hunt, and C. D. Allis, submitted for publication. We then applied a large collection of post-translational modification-specific antibodies to this collection of histones (Coomassie stain of histones shown in Fig. 3a, cropped from Fig. 2a for clarity and reference). Fig. 3b shows the relative enrichment of lysine methylation states (mono-, di-, and trimethylation) on H3K4, H3K9, K3K27, H3K79, H4K79, and H4K20. Note that lysine methylation is underrepresented in the embryonic cell types (oocyte and egg in particular) and more abundant in somatic cell types. Fig. 3c shows the relative enrichment of lysine acetylation on H4K5, H4K8, H4K12, and H4K16 and on histone H3 and specifically on Lys9 and Lys14. Note that H4 lysine acetylation has a relatively high abundance in the stored oocyte and egg samples, consistent with the known predeposition role for the acetylation. Fig. 3d shows the relative abundance of arginine methylation states on H2A and H4 R3 (mono-, symmetric di-, and asymmetric dimethylation), the H2A/H4 citrulline 3 deiminiation product, and on H3 Arg2, Arg17, and Arg26. In contrast to lysine methylation, arginine methylation is overrepresented in the embryonic tissue types relative to the somatic cell types. Note that we observed that Arg3 methylation was more abundant on H2A.X than on canonical H2A in the oocyte and egg, hence its slower migration (lanes 4 and 5) compared with the R3me-stained band in the somatic cells (lanes 5 and 6) (also data not shown). We then probed these histones for phosphorylation on H2A/H4 Ser1, which is extremely abundant in"

Morbidly obese human patients have been shown to possess single nucleotide polymorphisms in the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R). MC4R knockout mice have been well characterized as a genetic model that possesses phenotypic metabolic disorders, including obesity, hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia, similar to those observed in humans possessing dysfunctional hMC4Rs. Using this model, we examined the effect of voluntary exercise of MC4R knockout mice that were allowed access to a running wheel for a duration of 8 wk. Physiological parameters that were measured included body weight, body composition of fat and lean mass, food consumption, body length, and blood levels of cholesterol and nonfasted glucose, insulin, and leptin. At the termination of the experiment, hypothalamic mRNA expression levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein (AGRP), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), orexin, brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), phosphatase with tensin homology (Pten), melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R), and NPY-Y1R were determined. In addition, islet cell distribution and function in the pancreas were examined. In the exercising MC4R knockout mice, the pancreatic islet cell morphology and other physiological parameters resembled those observed in the wild-type littermate controls. Gene expression profiles identified exercise as having a significant effect on hypothalamic POMC, orexin, and MC3R levels. Genotype had a significant effect on AGRP, POMC, CART, and NPY-Y1R, with an exercise and genotype interaction effect on NPY gene expression. These data support the hypothesis that voluntary exercise can prevent the genetic predisposition of melanocortin-4 receptor-associated obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1976727749,"The ectodomain shedding of syndecan-1, a major cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, modulates molecular and cellular processes central to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Syndecan-1 shedding is a highly regulated process in which outside-in signaling accelerates the proteolytic cleavage of syndecan-1 ectodomains at the cell surface. Several extracellular agonists that induce syndecan-1 shedding and metalloproteinases that cleave syndecan-1 ectodomains have been identified, but the intracellular mechanisms that regulate syndecan-1 shedding are largely unknown. Here we examined the role of the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain in the regulation of agonist-induced syndecan-1 shedding. Our results showed that the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain is essential because mutation of invariant cytoplasmic Tyr residues abrogates ectodomain shedding, but not because it is Tyr phosphorylated upon shedding stimulation. Instead, our data showed that the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain binds to Rab5, a small GTPase that regulates intracellular trafficking and signaling events, and this interaction controls the onset of syndecan-1 shedding. Syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain bound specifically to Rab5 and preferentially to inactive GDP-Rab5 over active GTP-Rab5, and shedding stimulation induced the dissociation of Rab5 from the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain. Moreover, the expression of dominant-negative Rab5, unable to exchange GDP for GTP, interfered with the agonist-induced dissociation of Rab5 from the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain and significantly inhibited syndecan-1 shedding induced by several distinct agonists. Based on these data, we propose that Rab5 is a critical regulator of syndecan-1 shedding that serves as an on-off molecular switch through its alternation between the GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms.

For instance, in adult tissues, syndecan-1 is predominantly expressed by epithelial and plasma cells, and to a lesser degree by other cell types (e.g. endothelial cells, fibroblasts). The overall structural design of syndecans is similar: starting at the NH2 terminus, the three major domains are the extracellular ectodomain where HS chains attach distally to the plasma membrane, followed by the highly conserved transmembrane and short cytoplasmic domains.Syndecans function as a coreceptor on the cell surface and also as a soluble heparan sulfate proteoglycan in the extracellular environment because its ectodomain, replete with all its HS chains, can be shed by metalloproteinases (1Bernfield M.

Current evidence suggests that the ectodomain shedding of syndecan-1 is an innate host response to tissue injury and inflammation. Syndecan-1 shedding is stimulated in vitro by several inflammatory factors and in vivo under certain pathological conditions.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 5758-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Results from animal studies suggest that syndecan-1 shedding modulates the extent and outcome of inflammatory processes. For example, in the mouse model of acute P. aeruginosa pneumonia, syndecan-1 shedding enhanced by LasA, a virulence factor for P. aeruginosa lung infection, promotes bacterial colonization and infectious pneumonia by dysregulating host defense mechanisms in an HS-dependent manner (11Park P.W.

Hinkes M.T. Bernfield M. Nature. 2001; 411: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In contrast, in animal models of non-infectious tissue injury and inflammation, syndecan-1 shedding apparently protects the host from inflammatory tissue damage by regulating inflammatory factors and assuring the correct functioning of inflammation. In the mouse model of allergic lung inflammation, syndecan-1 ectodomain attenuates inflammation by inhibiting CC chemokine (CCL7, 11, 17)-induced homing of Th2 cells to the lung, a central process in the development of allergic diseases (27Xu J. Park P.W. Kheradmand F. Corry D.B. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 5758-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas syndecan-1 shedding coordinates the generation of a KC (CXCL1) chemokine gradient that guides the transepithelial migration of neutrophils into the airspace in bleomycin-induced acute lung injury (26Li Q. Park P.W. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). These data highlight the diverse and critical functions of syndecan-1 shedding in modulating inflammatory disorders in vivo.Despite its importance in modulating a variety of key inflammatory processes, the underlying mechanisms of how syndecan-1 shedding is regulated are incompletely understood. Much is known about the identity of extracellular agonists of syndecan-1 shedding, and several syndecan-1 sheddases, such as matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7, matrilysin) (26Li Q. Park P.W.

The syndecan cytoplasmic domain is composed of two invariant regions (C1 and C2), separated by a central variable region (V) that is distinct for each family member (1Bernfield M. Götte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the syndecan cytoplasmic domain contains several signaling motifs, including one invariant Ser, four invariant Tyr, and a Glu-Phe-Tyr-Ala PDZ binding domain at the COOH terminus. Collectively, these observations suggest that the cytoplasmic domain plays a vital role in the regulation of syndecan functions in vivo, including syndecan-1 shedding.In this study, we sought to define the regulatory role of syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain in agonist-induced syndecan-1 ectodomain shedding. Our results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain is essential, but not because it is Tyr phosphorylated upon shedding stimulation. Instead, our results show that the syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain interacts specifically with the small GTPase Rab5, and the oscillation between the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Rab5 serves as an intracellular on-off molecular switch of syndecan-1 shedding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and C2 ceramide were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).

The GST-syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain and GST-Rab5 fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21 was transformed with the recombinant constructs, grown to logarithmic growth phase, and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5! (v/v) Triton X-100. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and fractionated by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography, and bound proteins were eluted with 15 mm reduced glutathione. In some experiments, the GST moiety was removed from the recombinant proteins by incubating overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of thrombin-agarose slurry in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm CaCl2) and removing the cleaved GST by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography. To generate recombinant FLAG-tagged syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain, the entire mouse syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer containing the sequence encoding FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK).

To obtain virus particles, plasmids were linearized by PacI digestion and transfected into 293A cells with Lipofectamine 2000. When most cells were detached (∼7–10 days), cells were harvested by gentle pipetting in culture medium, lysed by three cycles of freeze/thawing, and centrifuged to collect the supernatant containing crude viral lysates. To amplify virus titers, 100 μl of crude viral lysates were added to fresh 293A cells, and cultured for several days until all cells were detached. Virus-enriched supernatants were collected and viral titers were determined by the plaque-forming assay with 293A cells.Co-sedimentation Assay—Recombinant syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain free of GST (Sdc1-CPD) was coupled to Ultralink affinity resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. NMuMG total cell lysate was prepared by sonicating cells in lysis buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5! Triton X-100) followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The cleared total cell lysate (5 mg) was incubated overnight with 10 μg of Sdc1-CPD coupled to Ultralink in the presence of 1 mg of recombinant GST-tagged syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain or 1 mg of BSA at 4 °C and washed three times with lysis buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted by adding SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.In some experiments, GST-tagged human Rab5 coupled to Ultralink, preloaded with GTPγS or GDP, was used to precipitate syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain from mildly trypsinized NMuMG total cell lysates. NMuMG cells were treated with 10 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin and sonicated in lysis buffer A to obtain cell lysates enriched in syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain. GST-tagged human Rab5 was coupled to Ultralink and incubated in buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm GTPγS or 5 mm GDP at room temperature for 1 h under rotation. The beads were washed and incubated with stabilization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2) containing 100 μm GTPγS or GDP for 10 min at room temperature. NMuMG cell lysate (1 mg) was incubated with either GTPγS or GDP preloaded Rab5-Ultralink beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer.Co-immunoprecipitation—NMuMG cells treated with or without shedding agonists were lysed in lysis buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5! Triton X-100). The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was incubated overnight with 3 μg of 281-2 anti-syndecan-1 or Ky8.2 anti-syndecan-4 antibody at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Protein G-agarose beads (20 μl) were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. In some experiments, immunoprecipitation was performed with 281-2 antibodies directly coupled to Ultralink beads. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer B, and resuspended in non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitation was also performed in the presence of excess recombinant syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain devoid of GST (150 μg/ml). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, Western blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with rabbit anti-Rab5 or rabbit anti-GFP antibodies. For Western immunoblotting of syndecan-1, samples were resuspended in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon Ny+ membranes, and developed with the 281-2 antibody.Direct Binding Assay—Direct binding between syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain and Rab5 was measured by incubating purified FLAG-tagged syndecan-1 cytoplasmic domain (100 ng/ml) with GDP or GTPγS pre-loaded Rab5 coupled to Ultralink in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml BSA for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Measurement of Cell Surface and Shed Syndecan-1—Syndecan-1 shedding was assessed as described previously (10Park P.W.

Briefly, confluent cultures of NMuMG, A431, or A549 epithelial cells were transduced with adenovirus harboring LacZ, GFP-WT human Rab5, or GFP-DN human Rab5 at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for NMuMG and A431 cells and 2 for A549 cells. At day 3, cells were incubated with various test samples for the indicated times at 37 °C. To quantify shedding, the conditioned medium was collected, spun down to remove cells, and acidified by addition of NaOAc (pH 4.5), NaCl, and Tween 20 to a final concentration of 50 mm, 150 mm, and 0.1! (v/v), respectively. Various volumes of the acidified samples were dot blotted onto Immobilon Ny+ and developed with specific antibodies and ECL.Quantification of cell surface syndecan-1 was performed by mild trypsinization and measurement of the released syndecan-1 ectodomains by dot immunoblotting as described previously (31Hayashida K.

https://openalex.org/W2091326318,"Background Eight outbreaks of paralytic polio attributable to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) have highlighted the risks associated with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) use in areas of low vaccination coverage and poor hygiene. As the Polio Eradication Initiative enters its final stages, it is important to consider the extent to which these viruses spread under different conditions, so that appropriate strategies can be devised to prevent or respond to future cVDPV outbreaks. Methods and Findings This paper examines epidemiological (temporal, geographic, age, vaccine history, social group, ascertainment), and virological (type, genetic diversity, virulence) parameters in order to infer the numbers of individuals likely to have been infected in each of these cVDPV outbreaks, and in association with single acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases attributable to VDPVs. Although only 114 virologically-confirmed paralytic cases were identified in the eight cVDPV outbreaks, it is likely that a minimum of hundreds of thousands, and more likely several million individuals were infected during these events, and that many thousands more have been infected by VDPV lineages within outbreaks which have escaped detection. Conclusions Our estimates of the extent of cVDPV circulation suggest widespread transmission in some countries, as might be expected from endemic wild poliovirus transmission in these same settings. These methods for inferring extent of infection will be useful in the context of identifying future surveillance needs, planning for OPV cessation and preparing outbreak response plans."

This process can be mimicked in vitro in defined media, the composition of which is based on the electrolyte concentration of the oviductal fluid. It is well established that capacitation requires Na+, HCO3-, Ca2+, and a cholesterol acceptor; however, little is known about the function of Cl– during this important process. To determine whether Cl–, in addition to maintaining osmolarity, actively participates in signaling pathways that regulate capacitation, Cl– was replaced by either methanesulfonate or gluconate two nonpermeable anions. The absence of Cl– did not affect sperm viability, but capacitation-associated processes such as the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, the increase in cAMP levels, hyperactivation, the zona pellucidae-induced acrosome reaction, and most importantly, fertilization were abolished or significantly reduced. Interestingly, the addition of cyclic AMP agonists to sperm incubated in Cl–-free medium rescued the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and hyperactivation suggesting that Cl– acts upstream of the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway. To investigate Cl– transport, sperm incubated in complete capacitation medium were exposed to a battery of anion transport inhibitors. Among them, bumetanide and furosemide, two blockers of Na+/K+/Cl– cotransporters (NKCC), inhibited all capacitation-associated events, suggesting that these transporters may mediate Cl– movements in sperm. Consistent with these results, Western blots using anti-NKCC1 antibodies showed the presence of this cotransporter in mature sperm.

Consistent with these results, Western blots using anti-NKCC1 antibodies showed the presence of this cotransporter in mature sperm. Before becoming fertilization-competent, mammalian sperm must undergo a series of maturational processes in the female reproductive tract (1Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction (Knobil. eds. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 187-317Google Scholar). The molecular, biochemical, and physiological changes that occur in sperm, whereas in the female tract are collectively referred to as capacitation. These functional changes associated with capacitation are not one event but are a combination of sequential and concomitant processes involving modifications at the molecular level occurring both in the head (i.e. preparation for the acrosome reaction) and the tail (i.e. motility changes such as hyperactivation). Molecular events implicated in the initiation of capacitation can be mimicked in vitro and have been partially defined. These include removal of cholesterol from the sperm plasma membrane; modifications in plasma membrane phospholipids; fluxes of HCO3- and other intracellular ions; increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation; and hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane potential (Em) in mouse and other species (for review see Ref. 2Visconti P.E. Westbrook V.A. Chertihin O. Demarco I. Sleight S. Diekman A.B. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 53: 133-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). With respect to the changes in the plasma membrane Em in mouse sperm, it is hypothesized that the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization results from changes in the activity of ion-selective channels and transporters. Consistent with this hypothesis, our studies in sperm from this species have revealed the presence of amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs) 2The abbreviations used are:ENaCepithelial Na+ channelNKCCNa+/K+/Cl– cotransporterCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane regulatorZPzona pellucidaSp-cAMPSSp-diastereomer of adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphothiorateIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthineDPCdiphenylamine-2-carboxylateinh-1725-[(4-carboxyphenyl)methylene]-2-thioxo-3-[(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl-4-thiazolidinoneDIDS4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acidSITSdisodium 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanato-stilben-2,2′-disulfonateDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salineIVFin vitro fertilizationPYphosphotyrosineCASAcomputer-assisted semen analysisClCCl–-selective ion channelKCCK+/Cl– cotransportersACsoluble adenylyl cyclasePKAprotein kinase A and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) (3Hernandez-Gonzalez E.O.

Experiments in those reports suggest that closing of ENaCs, with the consequent reduction in Na+ influx, induces the hyperpolarization of the sperm Em observed during capacitation. Down-regulation of ENaC activity appears to be a consequence of either the activation of CFTR or the influx of Cl–. Independent of our work, the presence of CFTR in sperm was also reported by Xu et al. (5Xu W.M. Shi Q.X. Chen W.Y. Zhou C.X. Ni Y. Rowlands D.K. Yi Liu G. Zhu H. Ma Z.G. Wang X.F. Chen Z.H. Zhou S.C.

Intracellular Cl– levels are determined by the relative contributions of all Cl– transporters present in the plasma membrane of a given cell type. Cl– channels are a subset of ion channels selective to Cl– and often permeable to other small monovalent anions. Four structural Cl– channel families have been identified to date: 1) Cl–-selective ion channels (ClCs); 2) CFTR channels; 3) the γ-aminobutyric acid- and glycine-gated neurotransmitter receptors; and 4) Ca2+-activated Cl– channels. In addition, functional data suggest that other not yet identified Cl– channels may exist. The Cl– carrier proteins include: 1) the electroneutral and electrogenic Cl-/HCO3- exchanger families (6Steward M.C. Ishiguro H. Case R.M. Annu Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 377-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and 2) the electroneutral cation-Cl– cotransporter family. All of these are secondary active transporters, which means that the translocation of one ion is coupled to the translocation of another ion in either the opposite direction (antiporter) or the same direction (cotransporter or symporter). The flow of the ion translocated up the electrochemical gradient is coupled to the flow of a second ion down its electrochemical gradient, and thus the energy required does not come directly from ATP (7Akabas M.H. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences. ed. Macmillan Reference Ltd., London2001: 1-7Google Scholar). In the present work we have analyzed whether Cl– ions regulate different events in the capacitation process. The central observations of this work are that: 1) Cl– is necessary for the capacitation-associated increase in cAMP and tyrosine phosphorylation; 2) sperm incubated in a medium without Cl– do not acquire either responsiveness to zona pellucidae (ZP) for the induction of acrosome reaction nor hyperactivated motility; 3) fertilization is inhibited if sperm are incubated under capacitating medium without Cl–; 4) in the absence of Cl–, cAMP-permeable analogs can induce both the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation as well as hyperactivated motility; 5) bumetanide and furosemide, two Na+/K+/Cl– cotransporter (NKCC) inhibitors, block capacitation and the capacitation-associated processes; and 6) at least one member of the NKCC family is present in mature sperm.

The fluorescent dyes 3,3-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3-(5)) and Hoestch 33342 were obtained from Invitrogen. Niflumic acid was from Calbiochem. Cyclic AMP analogs and inhibitors were prepared fresh the day of the experiment in either Milli-Q water or DMSO depending on solubility. Anti-phosphotyrosine (PY) monoclonal antibody (clone 4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). In addition, for immunodetection of NKCC and β-tubulin, an anti-NKCC1 monoclonal antibody (clone T4) developed by Lytle et al. (8Lytle C. Xu J.C. Biemesderfer D. Forbush III, B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1496-C1505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Clone E7) developed by Chu and Klymkowsky (9Chu D.T. Klymkowsky M.W. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health, NICHD, and maintained by The University of Iowa Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA. For negative control donkey anti-mouse affinity-purified IgG was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Mouse Sperm Preparation—Cauda epididymal mouse sperm were collected from CD1 retired male breeders (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) and sacrificed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Minced cauda epididymis from each animal was placed in 500 μl of a modified Krebs-Ringer medium (Whitten's HEPES-buffered medium) (10Moore G.D. Ayabe T. Visconti P.E. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Development (Camb.). 1994; 120: 3313-3323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This medium does not support capacitation unless supplemented with 5 mg/ml BSA (fatty acid-free) and 15 mm NaHCO3. After 10 min, the sperm suspension was washed by adding 1 ml of noncapacitating medium and posterior centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Sperm were then resuspended to a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml and diluted 10 times in the appropriate medium depending on the experiment performed. In experiments where capacitation was investigated, 5 mg/ml BSA and 15 mm NaHCO3 were added, and sperm were incubated at 37 °C for at least 1 h. To study the role of Cl– in capacitation, NaCl and KCl in the media were replaced either by sodium gluconate and potassium gluconate or by sodium methanesulfonate and KOH. In all cases pH was maintained at 7.2. When different Cl– concentrations were assessed, the total NaCl plus sodium gluconate (or sodium methanesulfonate) was maintained at 100 mm. For the experiments in K+-free media, KCl and KH2PO4 were replaced by NaCl and NaH2PO4, respectively. To test the effect of the different inhibitors in capacitation, they were pre-incubated with sperm for 15 min preceding the beginning of the capacitating incubation. For the in vitro fertilization (IVF) assays, sperm were obtained and incubated for capacitation in Whitten's medium without HEPES containing 22 mm NaHCO3 and 15 mg/ml BSA and equilibrated in a humidified atmosphere of 5! CO2 in air (11Tutuncu L. Stein P. Ord T.S. Jorgez C.J. Williams C.J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 246-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Sperm Membrane Purification—The preparation of sperm fractions was carried out as described previously (12Visconti P.E. Olds-Clarke P. Moss S.B. Kalab P. Travis A.J. de las Heras M. Kopf G.S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 43: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, sperm (20 × 107 cells) were homogenized using 10 strokes with a Teflon Dounce homogenizer in TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) as indicated by the manufacturer plus 0.4 mm leupeptin, 0.4 mm aprotinin, 0.1 mm pepstatin, 0.3 m benzamidine, and 0.32 mg/ml calpain I and II inhibitor). After homogenization, the sample was sonicated three times for 15 s on ice at intervals of 1 min. Cell debris was pelleted (1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Again, the resultant pellet was saved, and the supernatant then was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The final pellet, which contained the membrane fraction, was resuspended in sample buffer and used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—After incubation under different experimental conditions, sperm were spun down, washed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) without β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were saved, and β-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 5!. The samples were boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 8–10! mini-gels; protein extracts equivalent to 1–2 × 106 sperm were loaded per lane. Each gel contained dual prestained molecular weight standard (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic transfer of proteins to Immobilon (Bio-Rad) and immunodetection of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were carried out using PY monoclonal antibodies as described previously (14Kalab P. Visconti P. Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3810-3817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For loading controls, membranes were stripped, and an anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody was used at a 5.2 ng/ml. For immunodetection of the NKCC, an anti-NKCC monoclonal antibody was used at a concentration of 2.3 μg/ml. Immunoblots were developed with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and ECL chemiluminescence reagents. Kidneys from CD1 male retired breeders were collected, and proteins were extracted using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1! SDS, 1! Triton X-100, 1! deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). Protein concentration was assayed using the BCA kit from Pierce. In each lane 50 μg of total protein was loaded in an SDS-8! polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and Western blotting was performed using anti-NKCC1 antibodies. Sperm Motility Analysis—Samples of sperm were incubated in Whitten's medium without HEPES at 37 °C and 5! CO2 for 1 h. After incubation, the sperm suspension was loaded on a 20-μm chamber slide (Leja slide, Spectrum Technologies) and placed on a microscope stage heated to 37 °C. Sperm movement was examined using the CEROS computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA) system (Hamilton Throne Research, Beverly, MA). The parameters used were: frames acquired = 30, frame rate = 60 Hz, minimum cell size = 4 pixels, low average path velocity cutoff = 5 mm/s, static head size = 0.2–2.99, static head intensity = 0.26–1.31, and static head elongation = 0–100. Sperm with hyperactivated motility, defined as motility with high amplitude thrashing patterns and short distance of travel, were sorted using the criteria established by Bray et al. (15Bray C. Son J.H. Kumar P. Meizel S. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar): 1) curvilinear velocity (VCL, velocity calculated from the sum of track-point to track-point velocity) > 180 μm/s; 2) amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH, mean width of the sperm head oscillation as the cell swims), > 9.5 μm; 3) linearity (LIN, departure of the cell from a straight line) < 38!. Acrosome Reaction Assay—Capacitation was measured indirectly by determining the zona pellucidae-induced acrosome reaction based on the premise that only capacitated sperm will undergo exocytosis. Zona pellucidae were prepared from homogenized ovaries of virgin female 22-day-old outbred CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories) as described (16Ward C.R. Storey B.T. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14061-14067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17López-González I. De La Vega-Beltran J.L. Santi C.M. Florman H.M. Felix R. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and solubilized by the procedures outlined previously (18Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of acrosome reaction was measured using Coomassie Blue G-250 staining as described by Visconti et al. (19Visconti P.E. Galantino-Homer H. Ning X. Moore G.D. Valenzuela J.P. Jorgez C.J. Alvarez J.G. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3235-3242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Briefly, following a 45-min incubation at 37 °C under the conditions mentioned for each experiment, 5 zona pellucida equivalents/μl were added. After an additional 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, a fixative solution consisting of 5! final concentration of formaldehyde in PBS was added to each tube. Following fixation, 10-μl aliquots of sperm suspension were spread onto glass slides and air-dried. The slides were then stained with 0.22! Coomassie Blue G-250 in 50! methanol and 10! glacial acetic acid for 3–5 min, gently rinsed with deionized H2O, air-dried, and mounted with 50! (v/v) glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. To calculate the percentage of acrosome reaction, at least 100 sperm were assayed per experimental condition for the presence or absence of the characteristic dark blue acrosomal crescent. The percentage of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa was calculated for each experimental condition dividing the number of acrosome-reacted spermatozoa by the total number of spermatozoa scored (sum of acrosome-reacted and non-acrosome-reacted) and multiplying this ratio by 100. Mouse Eggs Collection and IVF Assays—Egg collection was performed as described previously (20McAvey B.A. Wortzman G.B. Williams C.J. Evans J.P. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 1342-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, metaphase II-arrested eggs were collected from 6–8-week-old superovulated CD1 female mice (Charles River Laboratories) at 13 h after human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma) injection. Cumulus cells were removed by brief incubation (<5 min) in Whitten's HEPES-buffered medium with 7 mm NaHCO3, 5 mg/ml BSA, and 0.02! type IV-S hyaluronidase (Sigma). After cumulus cell removal, eggs were placed in a drop of Whitten's medium containing 22 mm NaHCO3 and 15 mg/ml BSA and then allowed to recover for 30 min in an incubator with 5! CO2 at 37 °C (11Tutuncu L. Stein P. Ord T.S. Jorgez C.J. Williams C.J. Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 246-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fertilization drops (200 μl each) containing 10–20 eggs were inseminated with sperm (final concentration of 2.5 × 106cells/ml) that had been incubated for 1 h under capacitating conditions. After 4 h of insemination, eggs were washed through three drops of Whitten's medium containing 22 mm NaHCO3 and 15 mg/ml BSA using a thin bore pipette to detach any loosely attached sperm. After another 3 h of incubation, eggs were fixed with 3.7! paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min, washed, and stained with Hoestch 33342 (Sigma; 10 μg/ml final concentration) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. To assess fertilization the three following criteria were considered: 1) the formation of the male and female pronuclei, 2) the emission of the second polar body, and 3) the presence of the sperm tail. The percentage of fertilization was calculated for each fertilization drop by dividing the number of fertilized eggs by the total number of eggs in that drop (sum of fertilized and nonfertilized eggs) and multiplying this ratio by 100. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from isolated mouse pachytene, round and elongated spermatids (60Bellve A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 84-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) using TRIzol reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA samples with random hexamer-primed reverse transcription (Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen). cDNA was then subjected to PCR amplification using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The NKCC1 primers were designed using the mouse-reported nucleotide sequence for these genes (mouse NKCC GenBank™ accession number NM_009194.2). Primer sequences for mouse NKCC1 were as follows: forward, 5′-CCT GCT TTA CTT CAT C-3′; reverse, 5′-GTC AAA CCT CCA TCA-3′. The absence of genomic contamination in the RNA samples was confirmed with reverse transcription negative controls (no reverse transcriptase) for each experiment. Amplified products were analyzed by DNA sequencing in order to confirm their identity. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Sperm obtained by the swim-up method in Whitten's HEPES-buffered medium were washed once, resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1–2 × 105 sperm/ml, and seeded on 8-well glass slides. After air-drying, sperm were fixed with 3.7! paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS (four washes each for 5 min), and permeabilized with 0.5! Triton X-100 for 5 min. Following permeabilization, sperm were treated with 10! BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated either with the respective primary antibody (1:50–1:250) diluted in PBS containing 1! BSA or with the same concentration of the corresponding affinity-purified IgG. Incubations were then carried out at 4 °C overnight. After incubation, sperm were washed thoroughly with PBS and incubated with the corresponding Alexa 555-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200) diluted in PBS containing 1! BSA for 1 h at room temperature; these solutions also contained Alexa 488-conjugated peanut agglutinin (1:100) for staining acrosomes. Incubation with the secondary antibody was followed by four washes in PBS, mounted using SlowFade Light reagents (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and observation by epifluorescence microscopy using a TE300 Eclipse microscope (magnification ×60) (Nikon). Differential interference contrast images were taken in parallel and served as control for sperm morphology. Negative controls using secondary antibody alone were also used to check for antibody specificity (not shown). cAMP Measurements—Sperm (5 × 106 sperm/ml) were incubated for 1 h in noncapacitating (without BSA and NaHCO3) or capacitating medium (with BSA and NaHCO3) in the presence or absence of Cl– or bumetanide (1 mm). All treatments were supplemented with IBMX (0.1 mm). Afterward, the sperm were centrifuged for 2 min at 800 × g, the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of HCl (0.1 mm), vortexed twice for 2 s, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Next, sperm were centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was used to measure cAMP levels by using the BIOMOL format A cyclic AMP “PLUS” EIA kit (BIOMOL International, Plymouth Meeting, PA). A standard curve was run for each assay, and the unknown cAMP concentrations were obtained utilizing a weighted four-parameter logistic curve fitting (as recommended by manufacturer) with the aid of GraphPad software. Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The IVF experimental results were normalized to the control values, which were considered as 100!. In order to assume normal distribution, percentages were converted to ratios and all data subjected to the arcsine square root transformation (21Sokal R.R. Rolf J.F. Biometry: The Principles and Practice of Statistics in Biological Research. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1995Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed with the aid of GraphPad software using the parametric t test for simple comparisons and either the Tukey test following one-way analysis of variance or the Bonferroni post-tests after two-way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. Cl– Is Necessary for Capacitation—Cl– is involved in the regulation of the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization of the sperm Em (4Hernandez-Gonzalez E.O. Trevino C.L. Castellano L.E. de la Vega-Beltran J.L. Ocampo A.Y. Wertheimer E. Visconti P.E. Darszon A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24397-24406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, it has not been established whether Cl– acts upstream, downstream, or independently of other signaling pathways involved in capacitation. To analyze the role of Cl– in capacitation, media with different Cl– concentrations were prepared by replacing this anion with gluconate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Initially, the capacitation-associated increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blot using anti-PY antibodies. As shown previously (18Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in the absence of BSA and HCO3-, either with or without Cl–, there is no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). When BSA and HCO3- were present, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was observed only in the presence of Cl– (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on the Cl– concentration (Fig. 1B). Because hexokinase (116 kDa) is a protein that is constitutively phosphorylated in tyrosine residues (18Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is commonly used as a loading control for Western blots with anti-PY antibodies. To confirm this understanding, as an additional loading control each membrane was stripped and reproved with an anti-tubulin antibody (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Capacitation is linked to sperm flagellum hyperactivation and to sperm preparation for agonist-induced acrosome reaction. To investigate the effect of Cl– on hyperactivated motility, CASA of sperm incubated in capacitating media with or without Cl– was carried out. Although the percentage of motile sperm did not differ in either medium (with or without Cl–), the percentage of hyperactivated cells was significantly reduced in the absence of Cl– (Fig. 1C). To assure that the absence of Cl– did not affect sperm viability, sperm membrane integrity was tested using propidium iodide, a nonpermeable dye commonly used to assay this parameter. No difference in the percentage of viable sperm was observed between sperm incubated in media with and without Cl– (data not shown). Second, to test whether the pre"

This is probably due to increased awareness of hereditary hemochromatosis, and the availability of a genetic test for this condition. Most of these referred patients were over-weight middle-aged men with elevated ferritin levels, but without the hemochromatosis-predisposing gene mutations. We evaluated the relationship between hyperferritinemia and the metabolic syndrome in 40 patients.Forty consecutive patients referred for hyperferritinemia were investigated. The examination programme included medical history, clinical investigation and venous blood samples drawn after an overnight fast. This resulted in 34 patients with unexplained hyperferritinemia, which were further examined. Liver biopsy was successfully performed in 29 subjects. Liver iron stores were assessed morphologically, and by quantitative phlebotomy in 16 patients.The majority of the patients had markers of the metabolic syndrome, and 18 patients (52%) fulfilled the IDF-criteria for the metabolic syndrome. Mean body mass index was elevated (28.8+/-4.2), mean diastolic blood pressure was 88.5+/-10.5 mmHg, and mean fasting insulin C-peptide 1498+/-539 pmol/l. Liver histology showed steatosis and nuclear glycogen inclusions in most patients (19 out of 29). Only four patients had increased iron stores by histology, of which two could be explained by alcohol consumption. Fourteen of 16 patients normalized ferritin levels after phlebotomy of a cumulative blood amount corresponding to normal iron stores. Ferritin levels were significantly related to insulin C-peptide level (p<0.002) and age (p<0.002).The present results suggest that liver steatosis and insulin resistance but not increased iron load is frequently seen in patients referred for suspected hemochromatosis on the basis of hyperferritinemia. The ferritin level seems to be positively associated to insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2053847470,"A variety of physiological and pathological factors induce cellular swelling in the brain. Changes in cell volume activate several types of ion channels, which mediate the release of inorganic and organic osmolytes and allow for compensatory cell volume decrease. Volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC) are thought to be responsible for the release of some of organic osmolytes, including the excitatory neurotransmitters glutamate and aspartate. In the present study, we compared the in vivo properties of the swelling-activated release of glutamate, aspartate, and another major brain osmolyte taurine. Cell swelling was induced by perfusion of hypoosmotic (low [NaCl]) medium via a microdialysis probe placed in the rat cortex. The hypoosmotic medium produced several-fold increases in the extracellular levels of glutamate, aspartate and taurine. However, the release of the excitatory amino acids differed from the release of taurine in several respects including: (i) kinetic properties, (ii) sensitivity to isoosmotic changes in [NaCl], and (iii) sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, which is known to modulate VRAC. Consistent with the involvement of VRAC, hypoosmotic medium-induced release of the excitatory amino acids was inhibited by the anion channel blocker DNDS, but not by the glutamate transporter inhibitor TBOA or Cd2+, which inhibits exocytosis. In order to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to taurine release, we studied its release properties in cultured astrocytes and cortical synaptosomes. Similarities between the results obtained in vivo and in synaptosomes suggest that the swelling-activated release of taurine in vivo may be of neuronal origin. Taken together, our findings indicate that different transport mechanisms and/or distinct cellular sources mediate hypoosmotic medium-induced release of the excitatory amino acids and taurine in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2072669678,"DcuB of Escherichia coli catalyzes C4-dicarboxylate/succinate antiport during growth by fumarate respiration. The expression of genes of fumarate respiration, including the genes for DcuB (dcuB) and fumarate reductase (frdABCD) is transcriptionally activated by C4-dicarboxylates via the DcuS-DcuR two-component system, comprising the sensor kinase DcuS, which contains a periplasmic sensing domain for C4-dicarboxylates. Deletion or inactivation of dcuB caused constitutive expression of DcuS-regulated genes in the absence of C4-dicarboxylates. The effect was specific for DcuB and not observed after inactivation of the homologous DcuA or the more distantly related DcuC transporter. Random and site-directed mutation identified three point mutations (T394I, D398N, and K353A) in DcuB that caused a similar derepression as dcuB deletion, whereas the transport activity of the DcuB mutants was retained. Constitutive expression in the dcuB mutants depended on the presence of a functional DcuS-DcuR two-component system. Mutation of residues E79A, R83A, and R127A of DcuB, on the other hand, inactivated growth by fumarate respiration and transport of [14C]succinate, whereas the expression of dcuB′-′lacZ was not affected. Therefore, the antiporter DcuB is a bifunctional protein and has a regulatory function that is independent from transport, and sites for transport and regulation can be differentiated."
https://openalex.org/W2020313346,"Human malaria infections resulting from Plasmodium falciparum have become increasingly difficult to treat due to the emergence of drug-resistant parasites. The P. falciparum purine salvage enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PfPNP) is a potential drug target. Previous studies, in which PfPNP was targeted by transition state analogue inhibitors, found that those inhibiting human PNP and PfPNPs killed P. falciparum in vitro. However, many drugs have off-target interactions, and genetic evidence is required to demonstrate single target action for this class of potential drugs. We used targeted gene disruption in P. falciparum strain 3D7 to ablate PNP expression, yielding transgenic 3D7 parasites (Δpfpnp). Lysates of the Δpfpnp parasites showed no PNP activity, but activity of another purine salvage enzyme, adenosine deaminase (PfADA), was normal. When compared with wild-type 3D7, the Δpfpnp parasites showed a greater requirement for exogenous purines and a severe growth defect at physiological concentrations of hypoxanthine. Drug assays using immucillins, specific transition state inhibitors of PNP, were performed on wild-type and Δpfpnp parasites. The Δpfpnp parasites were more sensitive to PNP inhibitors that bound hPNP tighter and less sensitive to MT-ImmH, an inhibitor with 100-fold preference for PfPNP over hPNP. The results demonstrate the importance of purine salvage in P. falciparum and validate PfPNP as the target of immucillins.

Each year, Plasmodium species infect 300 to 500 million people and cause nearly two million deaths, mostly in children under the age of five in sub-Saharan Africa (1Greenwood B. Mutabingwa T. Nature. 2002; 415: 670-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Most deaths are due to infection with Plasmodium falciparum. Only AIDS and tuberculosis are more lethal human infectious diseases. No vaccine is available, despite intensive international efforts. At present, control of malaria is dependent on prevention with bed nets, insecticides or chemoprophylaxis, and chemotherapeutic treatment of clinical cases. However, chemotherapy for malaria has been complicated by recent increases in mortality and morbidity due to the emergence of drug-resistant strains (2Trape J.F. Pison G. Spiegel A. Enel C. Rogier C. Trends Parasitol. 2002; 18: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because parasitic protozoa are unable to synthesize purines de novo, purine salvage has been proposed as a potential target for chemotherapy of protozoan parasite infections, including those caused by Plasmodium spp. Malaria parasites are obligate intracellular parasites that carry out their asexual cycle in erythrocytes. Unlike most mammalian cells, erythrocytes have no biochemical machinery for de novo purine synthesis, but act as a rich source of purine salvage enzymes, particularly purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) 4The abbreviations used are:PNPpurine nucleoside phosphorylaseADAadenosine deaminaseHGPRThypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferaseMTAmethylthioadenosineWTwild type and adenosine deaminase (ADA). The purine salvage pathway of Plasmodium begins with the deamination of adenosine to inosine by ADA, followed by conversion of inosine to hypoxanthine by PNP. The final enzyme in the pathway is hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGXPRT). Hypoxanthine is a precursor for all purines and is a central metabolite for nucleic acid synthesis in P. falciparum. Interestingly, P. falciparum is able to survive in both PNP- and ADA-deficient erythrocytes, suggesting that Plasmodium enzymes, PfADA and PfPNP, are sufficient for survival of parasites within the erythrocyte (3Daddona P.E.

Shi W. Lewandowicz A. Singh V. Mwakingwe A. Birck M.R. Ringia E.A. Bench G. Madrid D.C. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9547-9554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although humans and other Apicomplexa, such as Toxoplasma and Eimeria, have a redundant pathway for purine salvage via adenosine kinase (6Chaudhary K. Darling J.A. Fohl L.M. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Donald R.G. Pfefferkorn E.R. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31221-31227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), PfPNP, PfADA, and PfHGXPRT appear to be the only pathway by which purines are salvaged in Plasmodium. Because P. falciparum expresses fewer enzymes in the pathways for purine nucleoside and MTA salvage than its host, these pathways are attractive targets for antibiotic design. Disruption of PfPNP expression or activity may not only affect purine salvage, but could potentially perturb homeostasis of the polyamine pathway. Immucillins are powerful transition state inhibitors of PNP that kill P. falciparum in vitro by inducing purine-less death (7Kicska G.A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Kim K. Schramm V.L. J.

Most immucillins tested in malaria cultures, such as ImmH, bind with a higher specificity to human PNP than PfPNP, and it could not be determined whether inhibition of PfPNP alone was capable of causing purine starvation in the parasite (7Kicska G.A.

The discovery of a novel purine-recycling pathway in malaria, with additional specificity for 5′-methylthiopurines, led to the development of a second generation of immucillins with 5′-methylthio modifications. MT-ImmH shows a 100-fold preference for PfPNP and kills P. falciparum in vitro with a similar IC50 to ImmH (5Ting L.M. Shi W. Lewandowicz A. Singh V. Mwakingwe A. Birck M.R. Ringia E.A. Bench G.

The additional specificity of PfPNP for 5′-methylthiopurines permits specific targeting of the malarial purine salvage pathway and perhaps the polyamine pathway by inhibiting a single enzyme. Many drugs have off-target interactions, and genetic evidence is required to demonstrate the importance of the proposed target. To further explore the importance of PfPNP we used single crossover homologous recombination (9Wang P. Wang Q. Sims P.F. Hyde J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 123: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) to genetically disrupt pfpnp in P. falciparum. Immucillin drug sensitivity profiles of both wild-type (WT) parasites and transgenic parasites lacking PfPNP (Δpfpnp) were altered, confirming the importance of inhibition of PfPNP for immucillin efficacy. The Δpfpnp lines have a greater requirement for exogenous purines and are unable to thrive at physiological concentrations of hypoxanthine. These results illustrate the importance of purine salvage enzymes for P. falciparum viability. P. falciparum Culture—Human erythrocytes were collected from local volunteers under protocol CCI 99-240 of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. P. falciparum, strain 3D7, was grown in RPMI supplemented with 0.5! (w/v) Albumax II (Invitrogen Corporation) and 50 mg/liter of hypoxanthine (∼370 μm) at 4! hematocrit (10Trager W. Jenson J.B.

Vector Construction and Parasite Transfection—The pfpnp allelic exchange fragment was PCR-amplified from 3D7 genomic DNA, using the primer combination p10/p11 (see supplementary materials). This yielded a 0.5-kb fragment that was cloned into the plasmid, pBSDmini, which contains the bsd gene that encodes resistance to blasticidin, flanked by promoter and terminator elements from cam (calmodulin) and hrpII (histidine-rich protein II), respectively (11Mamoun C.B.

The resulting 5.1-kb transfection plasmid, pBSDmini/pfpnp, was electroporated into the 3D7 P. falciparum ring stage parasites according to established protocols (9Wang P. Wang Q. Sims P.F. Hyde J.E.

In short, plasmid-transfected parasites were selected by the addition of 2.5 nm blasticidin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) to the culture medium, starting 48 h post-transfection. Parasite clones were obtained by two rounds of limiting dilution using 500 μm hypoxanthine in the culture media, and identified using the MALSTAT assay reagent specific for P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (15Fidock D.A.

Plasmid integration into the pnp locus was detected by PCR, using the primer combinations p1/p4 and p3/p6 (see supplemental materials and Fig. 1, A and B). Integration into the cam and hrpII loci was assessed using primer combinations p7/p4 and p8/p9, respectively (see supplemental materials and data not shown). Amplification of non-recombinant, endogenous pfpnp sequence was assayed using primers p1/p2 (see supplemental material and Fig. 1, A and B). PCR conditions included a primer extension temperature of 62 °C to account for the high A-T content in P. falciparum genomic DNA (18Su X.Z. Wu Y. Sifri C.D. Wellems T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1574-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI or HindIII. It was electrophoresed overnight at 2.5 V/cm in 0.8! (w/v) agarose gels (1.5 mg of DNA/lane), alongside the digoxigenin-labeled DNA molecular mass ladder (Roche Applied Science) and 2 pg of transfection plasmid digested with the appropriate enzyme. The DNA was then transferred to Nylon membranes, and cross-linked by UV irradiation. An internal 0.5-kb region of pfpnp and a 0.3-kb region of bsd were PCR-amplified using primers p12/p13 and p9/p10, respectively (see supplementary materials), and labeled with digoxigenin (Roche Applied Science). Hybridizations were performed at 60 °C, and membranes were washed at a maximum stringency of 0.3! SSC, 0.1! SDS (w/v) at 60 °C, prior to CDP-Star detection, and autoradiography. For stage-specific reverse transcriptase-PCR assays, cultures were doubly synchronized by sorbitol treatment. Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol® (Invitrogen). Cultures with >95! trophozoites were utilized for RNA extraction. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA, using the power shot pre-amplification system (BD Biosciences) with random hexamer priming. Western Blots and PfPNP and PfADA Antibody Production—The manufacturer's protocols were followed to raise mouse polyclonal antibodies, using the adjuvant TiterMax® Gold (TiterMax, Norcross, Georgia). Briefly, BALB/c mice were injected with 100 μg of purified recombinant His6-tagged PfPNP or PfADA emulsified in adjuvant. Mouse serum was collected 4, 6, and 8 weeks post-immunization. Western blots were performed on 0.1! (w/v) saponin-lysed parasite pellets that were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Blots were probed with 1:1000 dilutions of each primary antibody and detected using Renaissance Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagents (PerkinElmer Life Science). Drug Assays—In vitro drug responses were calculated using 72-h [3H]ethanolamine incorporation assays (19Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Antimicrob.

MT-ImmH, ImmH, 2′-deoxy ImmH, and 2′-deoxy ImmG were synthesized as previously described (7Kicska G.A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Kim K. Schramm V.L. J. Biol.

Immucillins were dissolved in water to make stock solutions, and diluted with media prior to addition to cultures. Following incubation with inhibitor for 18 h, 200-μl cultures in 96-well plates were supplemented with 1 μCi of [3H]ethanolamine (Amersham Biosciences; 25 Ci/mmol). After 54 h, cultures were frozen overnight and thawed to lyse the cells. The lysates were harvested on glass-fiber filters and washed with 1.2 ml of H2O. Filters were dried and counted in a Winspectral 1414 Scintillation Counter. Experiments were carried out multiple times with six replicate wells for each drug concentration. Drug inhibition concentrations were calculated by regression analysis of dose-response curves. S.D. ± mean was calculated for each IC50 value using KaleidaGraph version 4.03 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Individual data points more than two mean ± S.D. were discarded. The IC50 values ± the mean ± S.E. were calculated from the IC50 values from 3 to 12 independent experiments, and for each drug tested a one-way analysis of variance analysis in combination with a Bonferroni post hoc test was performed to determine the p values of the various group pairs using KaleidaGraph version 4.03 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Drug dilution series using the immucillins were carried out to expand the data set between concentrations of 1 × 10-8 and 1 × 10-6 m. These data are included in the determination of the IC50 values. For some experiments, parasitemias were counted on Giemsa-stained smears of cultures treated in parallel. Enzymatic Assays—Parasite lysates were obtained from parasites harvested from 60 ml of culture. The cell pellet was lysed using 0.1! (w/v) saponin and washed twice with STE, followed by two washes with 50 mm potassium phosphate pH 7.4. The pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate pH 7.4, then frozen and thawed five times. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the protein concentration of cell lysates determined using the Bradford method. 50 μg of protein (30-50 μl lysate) was used to assay for enzyme activity. Assays were performed in triplicate. Hypoxanthine produced by PfPNP was assayed by coupling to the xanthine oxidase reaction and measuring uric acid formation at 293 nm over time (7Kicska G.A.

PfADA action on adenosine or MTA was measured by the absorbance decrease at 265 nm. Reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate (5Ting L.M. Shi W. Lewandowicz A. Singh V. Mwakingwe A. Birck M.R. Ringia E.A. Bench G. Madrid D.C. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Schramm V.L. Kim K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9547-9554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The activity and S.E. of the parameters was determined using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in KaleidaGraph version 4.03 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Purine Requirements—Sorbitol-synchronized parasites were used, and each experiment was seeded with 1! parasitemia, with >95! rings and at 1! hemocrit. Assays were carried out in 200-μl volumes in 96-well plates. Stock solutions of 2 mm purines (hypoxanthine, adenosine, and inosine) were used for subsequent serial dilutions. Before beginning the experiment, the parasites were washed three times in purine-free culture media, resuspended in purine-free media, and added to the plates, which already contained a 2× concentration of each purine in an equal volume of media (i.e. 1× final concentration). Parasites were allowed to grow for 48 h with the corresponding purine at each concentration. After 48 h, 100 μl of media was removed from each well, and 100 μl of media with the appropriate purine concentration and 1 μCi of [3H]ethanolamine (GE Healthcare) was added. After 24 h of incubation with the radiolabel, cell cultures were frozen overnight and thawed to disrupt cells. The mixtures were then harvested on glass-fiber filters and washed with 1.2 ml of H2O. Filters were dried and counted in a Winspectral 1414 Scintillation Counter. The experiment was performed with six replicate wells for each purine concentration. Mean ± S.D. was determined, and two-tailed unpaired t tests were carried out to determine the statistical significance for each disrupted line as compared with the wild-type control line using KaleidaGraph version 4.03 (Synergy Software). These results were also confirmed using the lactate dehydrogenase assay, as described in Ref. 23El Bissati K. Zufferey R. Witola W.H. Carter N.S. Ullman B. Ben Mamoun C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9286-9291Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar. Doubling Time—Highly synchronized parasites were used, and each experiment was seeded with 1! parasitemia, with >95! rings and at 4! hemocrit. All parasites were washed three times in purine-free medium and resuspended in 5, 10, or 100 μm hypoxanthine. Giemsa-stained thin smears were taken every 24 h. The medium was changed every 24 h while maintaining the appropriate hypoxanthine concentration. Cultures were cut back to 1! when they reached 3-6! parasitemia (usually every 48 h). Smear identities were blinded and parasitemias counted in triplicate. Parasite -fold increases were calculated by correcting the parasitemias for the -fold dilution. Data were plotted using KaleidaGraph version 4.03, and curve fit analysis was carried out using the equation y = No e(kx) (where No = initial population, and k = growth constant). Growth constants (k) were used to determine doubling times. Production of PNP “Knock-out” Clones—A transfection plasmid, pBSDmini/pfpnp, was designed to disrupt full-length pfpnp in the chromosomal locus (9Wang P. Wang Q. Sims P.F. Hyde J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 123: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Mamoun C.B. Gluzman I.Y. Goyard S. Beverley S.M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8716-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A truncated portion of the pnp open reading frame was cloned into pBSDmini (12Lakshmanan V. Bray P.G. Verdier-Pinard D. Johnson D.J. Horrocks P. Muhle R.A. Alakpa G.E. Hughes R.H. Ward S.A. Krogstad D.J. Sidhu A.B. Fidock D.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2294-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Integration of pBSDmini/pfpnp into the parasite genome via homologous recombination and single site crossover was predicted to generate a pnp locus that was disrupted by the insertion of the plasmid, producing two non-functional fragments of pnp (Fig. 1A). The pBSDmini/pfpnp plasmid lacks the sequences for 10 amino acids at the N terminus and 53 amino acids at the C terminus. The 5′-non-functional fragment would lack Asp206, and the 3′-non-functional fragment would lack His7, both of which are critical for catalytic activity of PfPNP (21Shi W. Ting L.M. Kicska G.A. Lewandowicz A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Kim K. Almo S.C. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18103-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Electroporation of pBSDmini/pfpnp into 3D7 parasites generated episomally transformed lines that were maintained by selection with blasticidin (InvivoGen). Passaged lines were screened by PCR for homologous recombination and plasmid integration into the pnp, hrpII, or cam loci (data not shown). Bulk cultures from two independent transfection events tested positive for integration into the pfpnp locus at day 20 post-electroporation, and clones were immediately generated from this line by two rounds of limiting dilution (16Goodyer I.D. Taraschi T.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Initially, periodic cycling on and off blasticidin selection was performed before cloning; however, pnp disruptants were lost from cultures, suggestive of a growth disadvantage for pnp disruptants. Immediate cloning and maintenance of the parasites selected with blasticidin at high concentrations of hypoxanthine allowed us to successfully identify three pnp integrants from two independent transfections, as well as several hrpII integrants. The hrpII integrants were used as wild-type controls, because they had integrated the transfection plasmid but did not have a defect in PfPNP and could be maintained under similar blasticidin drug selection as the Δpfpnp clones. Prior studies have shown that integration into the hrpII locus is not deleterious (15Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Cooper R.A. Su X. Talley A.K. Wellems T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Goodyer I.D. Taraschi T.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 86: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Δpfpnp clones were confirmed by PCR analysis to be recombinant solely for pnp integration, and were PCR-negative for wild-type pnp (Fig. 1B). The Δpfpnp clones were PCR positive for intact plasmid, which would be expected if multiple copies of the plasmid were integrated into the locus. It is not uncommon for plasmids to form concatemers before integrating into wild-type loci (24Kadekoppala M. Cheresh P. Catron D. Ji D.D. Deitsch K. Wellems T.E. Seifert H.S. Haldar K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DNA isolated from the cloned parasite lines was transformed into Escherichia coli, and no colonies were observed, consistent with only integrated copies of the transfection plasmid present in the clones (data not shown). Southern blot hybridization confirmed that the endogenous pnp locus had been disrupted (Fig. 1C). Using a probe for pnp, hybridizing bands of ∼26, 5, and 7 kb, respectively, were detected upon EcoRI and HindIII digestion of genomic DNA from the Δpfpnp clones. These bands contrasted with the 2.3- and 8.5-kb bands generated by EcoRI and HindIII digests of untransfected 3D7 genomic DNA. The EcoRI restriction pattern was consistent with integration of multiple plasmids into the pnp locus. Integration of a single copy of the plasmid would generate a 7.4 kb band upon EcoRI digestion; however, a band at ∼26 kb is indicative of at least four concatameric copies of the plasmid. HindIII cuts the plasmid once, linearizing it. The 7-kb band in the HindIII digests is in accordance with the expected plasmid fragments connected to the 5′- and 3′-truncated gene and promoter regions in the locus. Integration was also confirmed using a probe for bsd, which encodes the blasticidin resistance cassette (data not shown). Expression Levels in Knock-out Mutants—To verify disruption of the pfpnp locus abrogated pfpnp expression, we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses on synchronized trophozoite-stage RNA preparations from the Δpfpnp clones and the 3D7 wild-type parent line. All Δpfpnp clones lacked pnp transcripts, but expressed normal levels of ada transcripts (Fig. 2A). To compare PfPNP protein expression levels between parental and recombinant lines, Western blots were performed on lysates of synchronized parasite cultures, using anti-PfPNP and anti-PfADA antibodies (Fig. 2B). PfPNP protein was absent in the Δpfpnp clones, whereas a band of ∼26 kDa was observed in the WT line. With longer exposures a cross-reacting band of ∼30 kDa was visible in all lines (as seen in Δpfpnp 1 in Fig. 2B). All lines possessed equivalent PfADA protein levels indicated by the band migrating at ∼42 kDa. To confirm the absence of enzymatically active PfPNP, protein lysates of wild-type (3D7 and hrpII integrants) and Δpfpnp derived from saponin-lysed infected erythrocytes were tested for PNP and ADA activity. All three Δpfpnp lines had ADA activity, but only the wild-type and hrpII integrant lines had detectable PNP activity (Table 1).TABLE 1Specific activities of PfPNP and PfADA in whole cell lysates of wild type and Δpfpnp linesSpecific activityParasite linePNPADAInosineMTIAdenosineap = 0.25.MTAbp = 0.23.nmol mg−1 min−13D723.0 ± 5.116.1 ± 3.850.0 ± 7.5131 ± 17hrpII integrant21.8 ± 4.514.8 ± 3.266.0 ± 8.8148 ± 32Δpfpnp 1NDcND, not detectable.ND42.5 ± 6.0112 ± 15Δpfpnp 2NDND47.3 ± 9.0155 ± 13a p = 0.25.b p = 0.23.c ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab Purine Requirements of the Δpfpnp Lines—The growth requirement of the Δpfpnp lines for exogenous purines was analyzed by measuring [3H]ethanolamine incorporation over time (19Elabbadi N. Ancelin M.L. Vial H.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ethanolamine incorporation has been shown to be proportional to parasite number, and its incorporation should not be affected by perturbation of purine metabolism. Hypoxanthine is the major purine in human serum with concentrations reported in the low micromolar range (0.4-6 μm) (25Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, 26Berman P.A. Human L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 309: 165-168Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The Δpfpnp lines exhibited a statistically significant reduction in incorporation of [3H]ethanolamine compared with the WT control at physiological concentrations of purine (12.5 μm purine and below) (Fig. 3, A-C). The requirement for higher levels of exogenous purines in the Δpfpnp lines was also confirmed by using the lactate dehydrogenase assay (Fig. 3D), in which parasite lactate dehydrogenase activity is used as a surrogate of growth. Therefore, the Δpfpnp lines have a greater need for exogenous purines than the WT control. There was a slight preference for hypoxanthine over inosine, and for inosine over adenosine as a source of exogenous purine; however, the difference was minimal (supplemental Fig. S1). Under these conditions erythrocyte metabolism can convert adenosine and inosine to hypoxanthine. Growth and Doubling Times"
https://openalex.org/W2155536094,"Plants maintain pools of totipotent stem cells throughout their entire life. These stem cells are embedded within specialized tissues called meristems, which form the growing points of the organism. The shoot apical meristem of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana is subdivided into several distinct domains, which execute diverse biological functions, such as tissue organization, cell-proliferation and differentiation. The number of cells required for growth and organ formation changes over the course of a plants life, while the structure of the meristem remains remarkably constant. Thus, regulatory systems must be in place, which allow for an adaptation of cell proliferation within the shoot apical meristem, while maintaining the organization at the tissue level. To advance our understanding of this dynamic tissue behavior, we measured domain sizes as well as cell division rates of the shoot apical meristem under various environmental conditions, which cause adaptations in meristem size. Based on our results we developed a mathematical model to explain the observed changes by a cell pool size dependent regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, which is able to correctly predict CLV3 and WUS over-expression phenotypes. While the model shows stem cell homeostasis under constant growth conditions, it predicts a variation in stem cell number under changing conditions. Consistent with our experimental data this behavior is correlated with variations in cell proliferation. Therefore, we investigate different signaling mechanisms, which could stabilize stem cell number despite variations in cell proliferation. Our results shed light onto the dynamic constraints of stem cell pool maintenance in the shoot apical meristem of Arabidopsis in different environmental conditions and developmental states."
https://openalex.org/W1991994042,"Elucidating the colonization processes associated with Quaternary climatic cycles is important in order to understand the distribution of biodiversity and the evolutionary potential of temperate plant and animal species. In Europe, general evolutionary scenarios have been defined from genetic evidence. Recently, these scenarios have been challenged with genetic as well as fossil data. The origins of the modern distributions of most temperate plant and animal species could predate the Last Glacial Maximum. The glacial survival of such populations may have occurred in either southern (Mediterranean regions) and/or northern (Carpathians) refugia. Here, a phylogeographic analysis of a widespread European small mammal (Microtus arvalis) is conducted with a multidisciplinary approach. Genetic, fossil and ecological traits are used to assess the evolutionary history of this vole. Regardless of whether the European distribution of the five previously identified evolutionary lineages is corroborated, this combined analysis brings to light several colonization processes of M. arvalis. The species' dispersal was relatively gradual with glacial survival in small favourable habitats in Western Europe (from Germany to Spain) while in the rest of Europe, because of periglacial conditions, dispersal was less regular with bottleneck events followed by postglacial expansions. Our study demonstrates that the evolutionary history of European temperate small mammals is indeed much more complex than previously suggested. Species can experience heterogeneous evolutionary histories over their geographic range. Multidisciplinary approaches should therefore be preferentially chosen in prospective studies, the better to understand the impact of climatic change on past and present biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2051736442,"Melanin is a common pigment in animals. In humans, melanin is produced in melanocytes, in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, in the inner ear, and in the central nervous system. Previously, we noted that human adipose tissue expresses several melanogenesis-related genes. In the current study, we confirmed the expression of melanogenesis-related mRNAs and proteins in human adipose tissue using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. TYR mRNA signals were also detected by in situ hybridization in visceral adipocytes. The presence of melanin in human adipose tissue was revealed both by Fontana-Masson staining and by permanganate degradation of melanin coupled with liquid chromatography/ultraviolet/mass spectrometry determination of the pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (PTCA) derivative of melanin. We also compared melanogenic activities in adipose tissues and in other human tissues using the L-[U-(14)C] tyrosine assay. A marked heterogeneity in the melanogenic activities of individual adipose tissue extracts was noted. We hypothesize that the ectopic synthesis of melanin in obese adipose may serve as a compensatory mechanism that uses its anti-inflammatory and its oxidative damage-absorbing properties. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that the melanin biosynthesis pathway is functional in adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2076182884,"Of the estimated 565,650 people in the U.S. who will die of cancer in 2008, almost all will have metastasis. Breast, prostate, kidney, thyroid and lung cancers metastasize to the bone. Tumor cells reside within the bone using integrin type cell adhesion receptors and elicit incapacitating bone pain and fractures. In particular, metastatic human prostate tumors express and cleave the integrin A6, a receptor for extracellular matrix components of the bone, i.e., laminin 332 and laminin 511. More than 50% of all prostate cancer patients develop severe bone pain during their remaining lifetime. One major goal is to prevent or delay cancer induced bone pain. We used a novel xenograft mouse model to directly determine if bone pain could be prevented by blocking the known cleavage of the A6 integrin adhesion receptor. Human tumor cells expressing either the wildtype or mutated A6 integrin were placed within the living bone matrix and 21 days later, integrin expression was confirmed by RT-PCR, radiographs were collected and behavioral measurements of spontaneous and evoked pain performed. All animals independent of integrin status had indistinguishable tumor burden and developed bone loss 21 days after surgery. A comparison of animals containing the wild type or mutated integrin revealed that tumor cells expressing the mutated integrin resulted in a dramatic decrease in bone loss, unicortical or bicortical fractures and a decrease in the ability of tumor cells to reach the epiphyseal plate of the bone. Further, tumor cells within the bone expressing the integrin mutation prevented cancer induced spontaneous flinching, tactile allodynia, and movement evoked pain. Preventing A6 integrin cleavage on the prostate tumor cell surface decreased the migration of tumor cells within the bone and the onset and degree of bone pain and fractures. These results suggest that strategies for blocking the cleavage of the adhesion receptors on the tumor cell surface can significantly prevent cancer induced bone pain and slow disease progression within the bone. Since integrin cleavage is mediated by Urokinase-type Plasminogen Activator (uPA), further work is warranted to test the efficacy of uPA inhibitors for prevention or delay of cancer induced bone pain."
https://openalex.org/W1977801447,"Epigenetic information is hypothesized to be encoded in histone variants and post-translational modifications. Varied cell- and locus-specific combinations of these epigenetic marks are likely contributors to regulation of chromatin-templated transactions, including transcription, replication, recombination, and repair. Therefore, the relative abundance of histone modifications in a given cell type is a potential index of cell fate and specificity. Here, we utilize mass spectrometry techniques to characterize the relative abundance index of cell type-specific modifications on histones H3 and H4 in distinct cell types from the frog Xenopus laevis, including the sperm, the stored predeposition histones in the egg, the early embryo equivalent pronuclei, cultured somatic cells, and erythrocytes. We used collisionally associated dissociation to identify the modifications present on histone H3 in a variety of cell types, resolving 26 distinctly modified H3 peptides. We employed the electron transfer dissociation fragmentation technique in a “middle-down” approach on the H4 N-terminal tail to explore the overlap of post-translational modifications. We observed 66 discrete isoforms of the H4 1–23 fragment in four different cell types. Isolation of the stored, predeposition histone H4 from the frog egg also revealed a more varied pattern of modifications than the previously known diacetylation on Lys5 and Lys12. The developmental transitions of modifications on H3 and H4 were strikingly varied, implying a strong correlation of the histone code with cell type and fate.

Our results are consistent with a histone code index for each cell type and uncover potential cross-talk between modifications on a single tail. Histone proteins compose approximately half of the mass of chromatin, the physiological form of the genome. Two molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are wrapped with DNA into a nucleosome (1Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar); nucleosomes are further compacted in larger fibers and ultimately into chromosomes. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) 3The abbreviations used are: PTM, post-translational modification; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ETD, electron transfer dissociation; PTR, proton transfer charge reduction; FT, Fourier transform; CAD, collisionally activated dissociation. of histone proteins, including, but not limited to, acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, sumoylation, and ribosylation, primarily on the disordered N-terminal “tails” (2Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8091) Google Scholar), have been hypothesized to constitute part or all of the histone code (3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

These histone modifications are thought to participate in the regulation of the usage of the underlying genetic information. Post-translational modifications of histones have been shown to play many roles in chromatin biology, including cis-acting roles for histone PTMs such as acetylation, in which the neutralization of the positively charged lysine ∊-amine alters chromatin compaction, and trans-acting roles for modifications, in which binding partners are recruited to facilitate enzymatic action (5Taverna S. Li H. Ruthenburg A. Allis C. Patel D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). These varied roles for histone modifications result in downstream chromatin positive and negative regulatory events, including, but not limited to, transcription, replication, and repair. Historically, these PTMs have been individually identified and characterized by a variety of techniques, including radioactive labeling and amino acid analysis, modification-specific antibodies, “bottom-up” mass spectrometry, and most recently by “middle-down” and “top-down” mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry approaches have allowed the relative quantitation of individual modifications on histones. Recently, techniques have been developed to identify modifications on a single, large peptide fragment, effectively a “middle-down” approach to MS analysis. A large piece of the intact protein can be analyzed separately for accurate mass and for sequence information/PTM localization. The development of electron capture dissociation (6Zubarev R.A.

Furthermore, relatively labile post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, remain intact when a peptide is subjected to electron capture dissociation or ETD fragmentation, making these techniques very useful for novel modification identification. However, we do note that the MS/MS spectra generated by these techniques are very complex, especially when generated by coeluting, isobaric parent ions, and therefore require extensive and time-intensive analysis. In particular, the single isoform of histone H4 has been particularly amenable to middle-down analysis of its N-terminal 1–23 fragment (11Phanstiel D. Brumbaugh J. Berggren W.T. Conard K. Feng X.

Egg histones were purified on heparin-Sepharose, as described, whereas chromatin-bound histones from pronuclei, erythrocytes, and tissue culture cells were acid-extracted as described, all in the presence of phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche PhosSTOP), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Complete), and 10 mm sodium butyrate (20Shechter D. Dormann H. Allis C. Hake S. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Core histones were chromatographically separated on a 4.6-μm C8 reversed phase column as described (20Shechter D. Dormann H. Allis C. Hake S. Nat.

H4—C8 reverse phase-HPLC-purified fractions corresponding to histone H4 from Xenopus sperm, egg, early embryo, or neurula (S3) cultured cells were combined (∼20 pmol of total protein) and incubated with endoproteinase AspN (Roche Applied Science) (1:20 enzyme/protein) for 7 h at 37 °C and in NH4HCO3, pH 8. The digestion was quenched with glacial acetic acid and stored at -35 °C prior to analysis. H3—Purified H3 (∼25 pmol of total protein) from Xenopus sperm, early embryo, neurula (S3) cultured cells, and erythrocyte was reduced with dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodoacetamide (21Schroeder M.J. Shabanowitz J. Schwartz J.C. Hunt D.F. Coon J.J. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 3590-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Following alkylation, H3 fractions were treated with propionylation reagent, digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) (1:20 enzyme/protein) for 7 h at 37 °C, and immediately retreated with propionylation reagent, as previously described (22Garcia B.A. Busby S.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Mishra N. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 2032-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Roughly 10–15 pmol of enzymatically digested mixtures of either H3 or H4 peptides were loaded onto self-packed microcapillary precolumns. Briefly, a fused silica precolumn (360 × 75 μm, outer diameter × inner diameter; Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) was packed with 8–10 cm of irregular 5–20 μm C18 beads (YMC, Kyoto, Japan) and connected via a Teflon sleeve (0.060 × 0.012 inch, outer diameter × inner diameter; Zeus Industrial Products, Orangeburg, SC) to a fused silica microcapillary analytical column (360 × 50 μm, outer diameter × inner diameter) packed with 6–8 cm of regular 5 μm C18 beads (YMC) and equipped with a laser-pulled (P-2000, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) electrospray emitter tip (2–5 μmin diameter). Peptides were gradient-eluted using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC (Palo Alto, CA) into either a Finnigan LTQ Quadrupole Ion Trap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) modified for ETD/proton transfer charge reduction (PTR) (6Zubarev R.A. Horn D.M. Fridriksson E.K. Kelleher N.L. Kruger N.A. Lewis M.A. Carpenter B.K. McLafferty F.W. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), a Thermo Electron LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), or a Finnigan LTQ-FT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) utilizing a gradient of 0–60% B in 60 min, 60–100% B in 3 min, and held at 100% B for 4 min (A = 0.1% acetic acid; B = 70% acetonitrile in 0.1% acetic acid). The LTQ-Orbitrap and LTQ-FT were operated in a data-dependent mode in which the MS1 scan was taken from m/z 300–2,000 in the Orbitrap (r = 30,000 at m/z 400) or ion cyclotron resonance (r = 100,000 at m/z 400) mass analyzer, followed by 10 CAD MS/MS scan events (normalized collision energy of 35 with a mass window of 3 atomic mass units) in the linear ion trap mass analyzer. A dynamic exclusion of 30 s was used with a repeat count of 2. The ETD/PTR-modified LTQ was operated in a data-dependent mode in which the MS1 scan was taken from m/z 300–2,000, followed by six MS/MS scans. For ETD, the radical anion of fluoranthene (m/z 202) accumulated in the linear ion trap for 2–5 ms and subsequently reacted with the parent ion from the MS1 scan for 90–120 ms. For PTR, the benzoate anion (m/z 121) accumulated in the linear ion trap for 2–3 ms and reacted with the ETD-generated fragment ions for 100–150 ms. High resolution H4 data were inspected manually using Qual Browser (Thermo Electron Corp.) software for all masses corresponding to H4 1–23 with any combination of 0–5 acetylations (Δ42.0106 Da), 0–5 methylations (Δ14.0157 Da), and 0–1 phosphorylation (Δ79.9663 Da); H3 analyses were manually inspected by accurate mass using Qual Browser for all combinations of up to six methylations and two acetylations on each the five tryptic peptides listed in Table 1. In addition, spectra were manually inspected for any additional highly abundant modifications and adducts. Masses that agreed to within 5 ppm of the theoretical mass were analyzed to determine their relative abundance with respect to all other modifications and combinations of modifications. Relative abundance information for each species was determined by taking the area under the curve of the selected ion chromatogram for the most abundant isotope for every charge state present utilizing a ±0.01 Da mass window and by comparing it with the sum of the areas for every unique species of the given peptide. For all species of H4 1–23 found in the high resolution analysis, ETD/PTR data were manually interrogated for sequence validation and for PTM localization; potential modifications observed on the peptides of H3 were localized using CAD data acquired in the linear ion trap of the LTQ-Orbitrap or LTQ-FT.TABLE 1Summary of high resolution analyses of PTMs seen on H3 peptides from Xenopus sperm, egg, erythrocyte, and S3 cultured cells Five H3 propionylated tryptic peptides (TKQTAR; KSTGGKAPR; KQLATKAAR; KSAPATGGVKKPHR; EIAQDFKTDLR) are shown in the left column. Each apparent modification on the lysines in those peptides is highlighted in the second column. The relative abundances of each modification in each histone source are displayed in the final four columns. Note that chromatographic separation of species containing Lys27 methylation from species with Lys36 methylation was not possible in erythrocyte or in S3 cells. Therefore, relative abundance information for mono- and dimethylation are reported as a single value. Open table in a new tab Histones were isolated from X. laevis eggs (predeposition histones complexed with chaperones), sperm, early embryo equivalent pronuclei, erythrocytes, and S3 cultured cells. The mixed histone population was further purified on a C8 reversed phase HPLC column to resolve each core histone in an individual fraction (Fig. 1). The peak fractions of histone H3 and H4 were then subjected to enzymatic proteolysis and subsequent mass spectrometry as described below. We propionylated histone H3 both before and after proteolysis and prior to mass spectrometric analysis. Conversion of unmodified and monomethylated lysine residues as well as protein and peptide N termini to their propionylated derivatives (an addition of 56.0262 Da per lysine and/or N termini), prevents trypsin from cleaving at lysines and also results in an increase in the overall hydrophobicity of derivatized peptides, allowing for enhanced retention of smaller H3 peptides. Propionlyation also tends to reduce the overall charge of a given peptide, allowing for efficient MS/MS analysis of the typically basic histone proteins via CAD. Histone H3—Table 1 shows an overview of all of the post-translational modifications observed on H3 from the four cell types analyzed. H3 species containing Lys9 and Lys14 from sperm and early embryo show Lys9 monomethylation at a level roughly equivalent to that of the nonmethylated form. This is in striking contrast to H3 from erythrocyte, in which a majority of Lys9 exists in the trimethylated state, as well as to S3 H3, which displays a preference for both mono- and dimethylated Lys9. Interestingly, although all cell types contain low to moderate levels of acetylation, only erythrocyte and S3 cells contain any combination of Lys9 methylation and Lys14 acetylation. For the mono-acetylated species observed in all cell types, analysis of various CAD MS/MS spectra shows the presence of both acetylated Lys9 and acetylated Lys14 (see Fig. 2). Although these two species are unique from one another (i.e. the modifications are not simultaneously present on the same peptide), they were not chromatographically resolved under the experimental conditions, and separate relative abundances could not be efficiently obtained. Therefore, the relative abundance noted in Table 1 for monoacetylated H3 9–17 includes the summation of both Lys9 acetylation and Lys14 acetylation. Acetylation distributed over Lys18 and Lys23 appears to be a relatively major modification seen on H3 of all cell types, existing on roughly the same order of magnitude as the unmodified form of the 18–26 H3 peptide. Diacetylation over both Lys18 and Lys23 was also detected in three of the four cell types and exists at roughly an order of magnitude below the acetylated species in sperm, early embryo, and S3 cells. MS/MS Analysis of H3 27–40 reveals the apparent mutually exclusive nature of methylation upon Lys27 and Lys36 in all cell types except for sperm; interestingly, only sperm H3 27–40 displays any combinatorial methylation marks over Lys27 and Lys36. Also of note is the observation that trimethylation was shown to exist on Lys27 in all cell types, yet no Lys36 trimethylation was seen. MS signals for the H3 peptide containing Lys4 display a clear preference in each cell type for the unmodified form of the peptide, with the monomethylated form existing at roughly an order of magnitude below the unmodified form. Histone H4—Following enzymatic digestion with endoproteinase AspN, a 23-residue peptide corresponding to the extreme N terminus of histone H4 was generated, providing complete coverage for the most heavily modified region of H4 and thus allowing for the comparative analysis of all combinations of N-terminal modifications of H4. H4 peptides were subjected to C18 reversed phase HPLC, which provides separation based upon increasing numbers of acetylations (differing by 42.0106 Da mass units). High resolution MS1 scans on the LTQ-Orbitrap of the various species of H4 1–23 containing, for example, a total of three acetylations, revealed distinct differences of 14.0157/z mass units, indicative of variously methylated forms of triacetylated H4 1–23. The same mass differences were seen for mono-, di-, and tetra-acetylated H4 1–23. Comparison of the N terminus of H4 from the four cell types under analysis revealed distinct patterns of acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation for each biological state. Fig. 3 shows MS1 scans from the LTQ-Orbitrap, demonstrating the unique patterns of methylation for triacetylated H4 1–23 for each cell type analyzed. For example, triacetylated sperm H4 1–23 displays abundant dimethylation but very minor mono- and trimethylation. This pattern of methylation appears drastically different from the methylation states of triacetylated egg, early embryo, and S3 H4 1–23. Egg H4 1–23 shows relatively equivalent amounts of the non-methylated, monomethylated, and dimethylated forms of triacetylated H4 1–23, whereas early embryo displays fairly abundant amounts of nonmethylated, triacetylated H4 1–23 relative to the mono- and dimethylated forms. S3 also exhibits abundant amounts of dimethylation in combination with triacetylation of H4 1–23 but also contains relatively abundant amounts of nonmethylation and monomethylation. An ETD/PTR tandem mass spectrum of the [M + 6H]6+ species of H4 1–23 containing two internal acetylations and two methylations (at m/z 419.9237) from Xenopus sperm is shown in Fig. 4. Manual sequencing of the fragment ions allowed for the full characterization of every potential PTM observed in the LTQ-Orbitrap analysis. Localization of both methylations to Lys20 was facilitated by the observation of the z3 (m/z 371) and z4 (m/z 527) ions, the latter of which displays a mass shift of 28 Da, indicative of lysine dimethylation. Full acetylation of Lys16 is indicated by the shift in mass of 42 Da above that of an unmodified lysine residue, observed on both the c16 (m/z 1539) ion and the z8 (m/z 1146) ion. Full N-terminal acetylation is observed from the 42 Da shift of the first c′ ion observed (c3, m/z 360) and is consistent with the known amino acid sequence of the N terminus of H4. Localization of the third acetyl group was more difficult due to the presence of two isobaric species within the isolation window: H4 1–23, containing N-terminal, Lys5, and Lys16 acetylation in combination with Lys20 dimethylation, and H4 1–23, containing N-terminal, Lys8, and Lys16 acetylation in combination with Lys20 dimethylation. We differentiated these two peptide species by the presence of two fragment ions, separated by 42 Da, for each of the c5, c6, and c7 ions (as well as for the complementary z16, z17, and z18 ions). We note that since the Lys5 acetyl species and the Lys8 acetyl species do not separate chromatographically on a C18 column, it is not possible to obtain separate relative abundance information. A summary of all combinations of PTMs observed on H4 1–23 from each cell type is shown in Table 2. Full N-terminal acetylation is observed in every combination in all cell types and therefore will be disregarded when the specific sites of modification are discussed.TABLE 2Representation of every PTM combination observed on the N terminus of H4 from Xenopus sperm, egg, early embryo, and S3 cultured cells Each row in the table represents a single discrete H4 1–23 peptide species. The left columns indicate the potentially modified residues on each peptide; empty boxes indicate that the residue is unmodified on that species, whereas colored boxes, as annotated in the key at the bottom, show the presence of a particular modification on that species. All observed peptides were acetylated on the N terminus. The relative abundances of each modified peptide species in each histone source are displayed in the final four columns. Isobaric species that do not separate chromatographically are grouped by brackets. Relative abundances between the isobaric species could not be adequately obtained; thus, each unique species within a bracketed group that was observed via ETD/PTR MS/MS is reported as existing at equivalent relative abundance. Open table in a new tab As seen in Table 2, analysis of H4 1–23 from transcriptionally silent sperm chromatin displays a large amount of Lys20 dimethylation, a known silencing mark, in combination with anywhere from two to four acetylations, with the majority of Lys20 dimethylation occurring in combination with acetylation over either Lys12 or Lys16. Additionally, sperm H4 uniquely contains slight amounts of Lys20 trimethylation as well as low level Arg3 monomethylation. A distinct absence of Ser1 phosphorylation is also apparent. H4 1–23 from stored egg histones shows Lys5 and Lys12 diacetylation present at >50% relative abundance. In addition, little methylation and phosphorylation is observed, and the total number of combinations is drastically reduced compared with the other cell types analyzed; specifically, only 10 unique combinations of modifications were observed on stored egg H4 1–23. A dramatic increase in the overall number of combinations of modifications is observed upon progression from the gametogenic cell stages (sperm and egg) to the early embryo cell type. Specifically, 34 unique combinations of modifications are observed, with a majority containing dimethylation over either Arg3 or Lys20. Interestingly, these two marks do not exist on the same N-terminal tail and thus appear to be mutually exclusive to one another. Also notable is the massive increase in Ser1 phosphorylation in the early embryo, a known mark of mitosis and DNA replication (23Barber C.M. Turner F.B. Wang Y. Hagstrom K. Taverna S.D. Mollah S. Ueberheide B. Meyer B.J. Hunt D.F. Cheung P. Allis C.D. Chromosoma. 2004; 112: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which is observed in multiple different combinations. Additionally, diacetylation over Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, and Lys16 is present to a significant extent, some of which may be remnants of the massive amounts of Lys5 and Lys12 diacetylation seen in stored egg histones. An apparent loss of overall acetylation on S3 histone H4 1–23 is seen in Table 2, with a substa"

The S. glossinidius quorum sensing system relies on the function of two regulatory proteins; SogI (a LuxI homolog) synthesizes a signaling molecule, characterized as N-(3-oxohexanoyl) homoserine lactone (OHHL), and SogR1 (a LuxR homolog) interacts with OHHL to modulate transcription of specific target genes.We used a tiling microarray to analyze the S. glossinidius transcriptome in the presence and absence of exogenous OHHL. The major finding is that OHHL increases transcription of a large number of genes that are known to be involved in the oxidative stress response. We also show that the obligate symbiont of the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (SOPE), maintains copies of the quorum sensing regulatory genes that are found in S. glossinidius. Molecular evolutionary analyses indicate that these sequences are evolving under stabilizing selection, consistent with the maintenance of their functions in the SOPE symbiosis. Finally, the expression studies in S. glossinidius also reveal that quorum sensing regulates the expression of a cryptic, degenerate gene (carA) that arose from an ancient deletion in the last common ancestor of S. glossinidius and SOPE.This oxidative stress response is likely mandated under conditions of dense intracellular symbiont infection, when intense metabolic activity is expected to generate a heavy oxidative burden. Such conditions are known to arise in the bacteriocytes of grain weevils, which harbor dense intracellular infections of symbiotic bacteria that are closely related to S. glossinidius. The presence of a degenerate carA sequence in S. glossinidius and SOPE indicates the potential for neofunctionalization to occur during the process of genome degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1997824035,"Kv channel-interacting proteins (KChIPs) are auxiliary subunits of the heteromultimeric channel complexes that underlie neuronal ISA, the subthreshold transient K+ current that dynamically regulates membrane excitability, action potential firing properties, and long term potentiation. KChIPs form cytoplasmic associations with the principal pore-forming Kv4 subunits and typically mediate enhanced surface expression and accelerated recovery from depolarization-induced inactivation. An exception is KChIP4a, which dramatically suppresses Kv4 inactivation while promoting neither surface expression nor recovery. These unusual properties are attributed to the effects of a K channel inactivation suppressor domain (KISD) encoded within the variable N terminus of KChIP4a. Here, we have functionally and biochemically characterized two brain KChIP isoforms, KChIP2x and KChIP3x (also known as KChIP3b) and show that they also contain a functional KISD. Like KChIP4a and in contrast with non-KISD-containing KChIPs, both KChIP2x and KChIP3x strongly suppress inactivation and slow activation and inhibit the typical increases in surface expression of Kv4.2 channels. We then examined the properties of the KISD to determine potential mechanisms for its action. Subcellular fractionation shows that KChIP4a, KChIP2x, and KChIP3x are highly associated with the membrane fraction. Fluorescent confocal imaging of enhanced green fluorescent proteins (eGFP) N-terminally fused with KISD in HEK293T cells indicates that KISDs of KChIP4a, KChIP2x, and KChIP3x all autonomously target eGFP to intracellular membranes. Cell surface biotinylation experiments on KChIP4a indicate that the N terminus is exposed extracellularly, consistent with a transmembrane KISD.

Biol. 2006; 13: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The Kv4 N terminus acts both as an ER retention signal (13Shibata R. Misonou H. Campomanes C.R. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A. Doliveira L.C. Carroll K.I. Sweatt J.D. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol.

Nolting A. Pongs O. Bahring R. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 210-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). KChIP binding overrides the activities of the Kv4 N terminus and leads to increases in surface expression and remodeling of inactivation kinetics (15Beck E.J. Bowlby M. An W.F. Rhodes K.J. Covarrubias M. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).An extraordinary KChIP4 variant known as KChIP4a has been reported to interact with Kv4 α-subunits and mediate an exceptionally slow inactivation previously unseen with other KChIPs, including other KChIP4 variants (7Holmqvist M.H. Cao J. Hernandez-Pineda R. Jacobson M.D. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Betty M. Ge P. Gilbride K.J. Brown M.E. Jurman M.E. Lawson D. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. Covarrubias M. Rhodes K.J. Distefano P.S. An W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This effect of KChIP4a has been attributed to novel functional effects of the K channel inactivation suppressor (KIS) domain that is encoded in the 34-amino acid alternative N terminus of this KChIP4 variant. Kinetic analysis results show that KChIP4a also slows channel opening, disrupts rapid inactivation of opened channels, and interferes with channel closing. KChIP4a probably affects ISA kinetics in native neurons in a similar manner, since the expression of KChIP4a transcripts in neurons from globus pallidus and basal forebrain is associated with a slowly inactivating ISA component and slower ISA deactivation kinetics (16Baranauskas G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2004; 20: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Indeed, heterologous expression studies suggest that in native neurons differential expression of DPLP and KChIP splice variants could regulate inactivation kinetics over a range of 100-fold (7Holmqvist M.H. Cao J. Hernandez-Pineda R. Jacobson M.D. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Betty M. Ge P. Gilbride K.J. Brown M.E. Jurman M.E. Lawson D. Silos-Santiago I. Xie Y. Covarrubias M. Rhodes K.J. Distefano P.S.

Cell Neurosci. 2007; 35: 604-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to the kinetic effects, KChIP4a-bound Kv4 channels tend to traffic poorly to the cell surface and instead prefer to remain in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus (13Shibata R. Misonou H. Campomanes C.R. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A. Doliveira L.C. Carroll K.I. Sweatt J.D. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36445-36454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). What additional role this regulation of trafficking plays in native neurons is not clear.Here we identify two additional KChIP isoforms (KChIP2x and KChIP3x) with high N-terminal sequence homology to the KChIP4a KISD. By coexpression studies, we determined that, like KChIP4a, KChIP2x, and KChIP3x, both possess a functional KISD capable of dramatically slowing down inactivation kinetics and interfere with the core-dependent promotion of surface expression. We then examined the biochemical properties of the KISD and show that the KISD is a transmembrane domain that completely spans the lipid bilayer and is capable of targeting soluble eGFP to membranes. In summary, our results highly suggest that the unusual kinetic and trafficking properties associated with the KISD depend on its transmembrane nature.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology—The following cDNAs were acquired or generated for functional studies in Xenopus oocytes. Rat Kv4.2 cDNA in pBluescript SK was obtained as previously described (4Jerng H.H. Qian Y. Pfaffinger P.J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2380-2396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Human KChIP3a and KChIP4b-L cDNAs were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in pT7T3D-Pac and pBSR, respectively. Human KChIP4a cDNA was generated by replacing exon 1 of 4b-L for that of 4a (KISD). KChIP2x and KChIP3x (KChIP3b) cDNAs were PCR-amplified from whole brain cDNA libraries generated from p21 Sprague-Dawley rats. PCR forward and reverse primers always contained nested restriction enzyme sites to allow the KChIP2x and KChIP3x cDNAs to be subcloned into pT7T3D-Pac.For mammalian cell expression in HEK293T cells, various cDNAs were subcloned into plasmid vectors with protein translation driven by the CMV promoter. pEGFP-N1 (pCMV-EGFP-N1) was purchased from Clontech, and human KChIP3a cDNA was subcloned into pCMV-EGFP-N/C (Clontech), replacing the eGFP open reading frame. Human KChIP4a and rat KChIP2x and KChIP3x cDNAs were PCR-amplified from the cDNA library previously described with the appropriate nested restriction enzyme sites for subcloning into pCMV-EGFP-N/C. Rat DPP6a (DPPX-E) and DPP6-S (DPPX-S) cDNAs were amplified by PCR from cDNA library and subcloned into pCMV-EGFP-N/C vector. Exon 1 of KChIP4a (4aNt), KChIP3x (3xNt), KChIP2x (2xNt), and KChIP4e (4eNt) were PCR-amplified and subcloned into pCMV-EGFP-N1 in frame with the eGFP open reading frame to create exon 1-eGFP fusion proteins. For surface biotinylation, cysteine substitutions in KChIP4a N terminus, including KChIP4a/N2C, KChIP4a/E4C, and KChIP4a/N2C/E4C, were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All DNA constructs were sequence-verified by automated sequencing (sequencing core facility of Baylor College of Medicine) and confirmed to be correct.Data Base Mining and Sequence Analysis—Data base mining for KChIP isoforms with N-terminal sequence similar to that of KChIP4a KISD yielded a KChIP2 isoform encoded by a human expressed sequence tag cDNA from adult nervous tumor (accession number BF919228). The same novel KChIP2 isoform was also described by a chimpanzee mRNA (accession number XM_001170567). This isoform was named KChIP2x. The same strategy yielded KChIP3x, an isoform previously named as KChIP3b (5Pruunsild P. Timmusk T. Genomics. 2005; 86: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). KChIP3x was identified as expressed sequence tag clones from human, mouse, rat, and cow (accession numbers CB615550, CJ058519, BB658948, DT821924, and AL540923). Interestingly, the organ sources for the expressed sequence tag clones are diverse and outside of the central nervous system, including dorsal root ganglia, heart, ileum, and placenta, agreeing with the reverse transcription-PCR results of Pruunsild and Timmusk (5Pruunsild P. Timmusk T. Genomics. 2005; 86: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that showed that KChIP3x is expressed outside as well as inside the brains of humans (i.e. colon, heart, kidney, placenta, prostate, salivary gland, stomach, testis, and thymus) and mice (i.e. heart, kidney, lung, testis, and thymus).The MEMSAT3 program was used to predict transmembrane topology, available at The PSIPRED Protein Structure Prediction Server (available on the World Wide Web)Electrophysiology—Run-off cRNA transcripts were synthesized from linearized plasmid DNAs using the mMessage mMachine high yield capped RNA transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). T7 or T3 RNA polymerase was used, depending on the plasmid. Kv4.2 cDNA, with or without an equimolar amount of KChIP cRNAs, was injected into stage V and VI defolliculated Xenopus oocytes using a Nanoinjector (Drummond, Broomall, PA). Afterward, injected oocytes were maintained at 18 °C for 1-2 days in standard ND 96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH) supplemented with 5 mm sodium pyruvate and 5 μg/ml gentamycin.A two-electrode voltage clamp technique was implemented to elicit whole-cell currents from injected oocytes. Bathed in normal ND96 solution, the oocytes were impaled by microelectrodes (<1 megaohm resistance) filled with 3 m KCl solutions, and studied at room temperature (22-23 °C). Voltage clamp protocols were controlled by either pClamp6 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) or WinWCP (John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK) and delivered by oocyte clamp OC-725 (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). The analog data were digitized and low pass-filtered before acquisition (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA). Average leak current was <0.2 μA, and the capacitance transients and leak currents were subtracted off-line using appropriately scaled up traces at voltages without ionic currents (at -90 mV).Transfections and Western Blotting—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells were cultured in DMEM+GlutaMAX™-1 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 4.5 g/liter d-glucose and 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate; catalog number 10569; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10! fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified 5! CO2 atmosphere. HEK293T cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), following precisely the manufacturer's protocols. Heterologous expression of proteins was tested 48 h after transfection by Western blot analysis, following a previously described protocol (4Jerng H.H. Qian Y. Pfaffinger P.J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2380-2396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Primary anti-pan-KChIP (K55/82; Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA), anti-eGFP (3E6; Invitrogen), anti-KChIP3 (FL-214; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-DPP6 antibodies (ab41811; Abcam; Cambridge, MA) were used at 1:1000 dilutions. After treatment with appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies, the bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence with an ECL detection kit (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate; Thermo Fisher Scientific).Fluorescent Confocal Microscopy—Twenty-four hours post-transfection, HEK293T cells were trypsinized and reseeded on 24-well clusters with poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and allowed to attach for 24-36 h. Cells were viewed under fluorescence on an Olympus BX51WI upright microscope with a ×60 water immersion objective, and images were captured using the FluoView FV300 confocal imaging software package on a desktop PC.Crude Membrane Preparation—Two days post-transfection, the cells were washed two times with precooled phosphate-buffered saline solution containing calcium and magnesium (PBS/CM; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, with HCl). The cells were then scraped into 1.2 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) plus protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet; Roche Applied Science). Afterward, the cells were homogenized by hand using a Dounce homogenizer for 12-15 strokes or until a homogenous suspension is achieved, followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei, cell debris, and unbroken cells. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet the membranes, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of homogenization buffer. The protein concentrations were estimated using the BCA assay (MicroBCA™ assay kit; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and aliquots were stored at -80 °C.Cell Surface Biotinylation—All solutions used throughout the procedure were kept ice-cold. After 48 h of incubation, transfected cells were washed two times with 2 ml of PBS/CM. For permeabilized cells, cells were first incubated in 1 ml of PBS/CM with 0.1! Triton X-100 for 1 min followed by incubation in, 2 ml of PBS/CM with fresh 6 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (pH 7.0) for 12 min at 4 °C. The TCEP solution was removed, and the cells were incubated in 1 ml of fresh 1 mg/ml maleimide-PEO2-biotin (Pierce) diluted in PBS/CM for 1 h. To ensure complete quenching of unreacted reagent, the cells were treated with 1 ml of PBS/CM with fresh 5 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min. Afterward, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS/CM before being recovered by centrifugation at 166 × g for 5 min at 4 °C.The recovered HEK293T cells were lysed in 400 ml of lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h (Lysis buffer: 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1! Triton X-100, 0.1! SDS, and protease inhibitor). To remove insoluble material, the lysates were centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate are then collected, and 20-μl aliquots were saved for gel analysis. Equilibrated streptavidin-agarose beads (50 μl; Novagen) were added to the lysate, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant mixing. The following day, the beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. After three or four washes, 50 ml of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added (sample buffer, 2×: 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 20! (v/v) glycerol; 4! (w/v) SDS; 200 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2! (w/v) bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). The bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. The eluted proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and prepared for Western blotting as described previously.Molecular Modeling—Kv4.2 plus KChIP structural model was constructed by combining the KChIP1-Kv4.3 T1 structural model (12Pioletti M. Findeisen F. Hura G.L. Minor Jr., D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with the Kv1.2 structural model (21Long S.B. Tao X. Campbell E.B. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2007; 450: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Initially, the transmembrane domain of Kv4.2 was threaded onto the S1-S6 region of the Kv1.2 model using the DeepView (22Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9467) Google Scholar) server, which also provided potential loop structures for missing segments. This model was then made tetrameric, and side chain clashes were removed using the NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics simulation package (23Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 27-38Crossref Scopus (36841) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web). The Kv4.2 T1 and KChIP2 sequences were then threaded on the KChIP1-Kv4.3 T1 structure using DeepView, which also provided potential missing loop structures. Next, the T1 domain of the KChIP2-Kv4.2 T1 model was fit to the Kv1.2 T1 domain model by root mean square deviation minimization, and this transform was used to move the KChIP4-Kv4.2 T1 model into registration below the channel. We then combined the transmembrane and T1 domain models for Kv4.2 by insertion of a linker segment between T1 and S1. Because of the presence of a Zn2+ site in the Kv4.2 T1 domain, forming a connection between channel and T1 domain with the length of chain available required a registration between the T1 domain and the TM domain of the same subunit different from what is seen in the Kv1.2 model. In the Kv1.2 model, these two domains are 90° rotated, whereas in the Kv4.2 model, they are on top of each other. The completed model was solvated, inserted into a POPC bilayer, and ionized with 150 mm KCl using VMD/NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics (23Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 27-38Crossref Scopus (36841) Google Scholar). The model was then minimized and equilibrated using NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics run on the Lonestar server (TACC through Teragrid). To model the KISD, an α-helical model was constructed inserted into a lipid bilayer model identical to that used for the channel and then minimized and equilibrated. These models were combined by docking the KIS model onto the side of the Kv4.2 transmembrane model and constructing a loop between the KISD and the KChIP core using the remaining sequence of KChIP4a. The combined solvated, membrane-inserted, and ionized structure was minimized, equilibrated, and simulated for over 4 ns. Model figures were made using VMD and Pov-Ray (Persistence of Vision Pty., Ltd.).Data Analyses—Peak conductance (Gp) was calculated as Gp = Ip/(Vc - Vrev), where Ip is the peak current, Vc is the command voltage, and Vrev is the reversal potential (-90 mV in ND96). Peak conductance-voltage (G-V) curves were described using the first-order Boltzmann function: Gp/Gp(max) = 1/(1 + exp(Vm - Va)/k)), where Gp/Gmax is the fraction of maximal conductance, Vm is the membrane potential, Va is the potential for half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. Steadystate inactivation was measured with 10-s-long conditioning pulses at the indicated potentials before pulsing to +50 mV to determine the amount of current inactivation. Steady-state inactivation is described using a single Boltzmann function, generating potential for half-maximal inactivation (Vi) and slope (k). The time courses of recovery from inactivation were measured using a two-pulse protocol. Briefly, two pulses to +50 mV (inactivating pulse and test pulse) were separated by a variable recovery interval at -100 mV to determine the time required for channel recovery. The results for recovery from inactivation were fitted with single exponential functions. Time courses of activation and inactivation were respectively measured by time points where half of the current activated (t0.5a) or inactivated (t0.5i). In addition, activation kinetics were also described by exponential fitting of the 50-90! of the current rising phase, yielding τ (50-90!). Data are presented as means ± S.E.

https://openalex.org/W2149101093,"Breast feeding has long term effects on the developing immune system which outlive passive immunization of the neonate. We have investigated the transfer of milk immune cells and examined the result of transfer once the recipients were adult.Non-transgenic mouse pups were foster-nursed by green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic dams for 3 weeks and the fate of GFP+ cells was followed by FACS analysis, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR for GFP and appropriate immune cell markers. Pups suckled by non-transgenic dams served as controls.Despite a preponderance of B cells and macrophages in the stomach contents of the pups, most cells undergoing trans-epithelial migration derived from the 3-4% of milk cells positive for T lymphocyte markers. These cells homed to the spleen and thymus, with maximal accumulation at 3-4 weeks. By sensitizing dams with an antigen which elicits a T cell-mediated delayed-type-hypersensitivity (DTH) response, we determined that nursing by a sensitized dam (compared to a non-sensitized dam) amplified a subsequent DTH response in females and yet suppressed one in males.These results suggest that clinical evaluation weighing the pros and cons of nursing male versus female children by mothers with genetically-linked hypersensitivity diseases, such as celiac disease and eczema, or those in regions of the world with endemic DTH-eliciting diseases, such as tuberculosis, may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2097011552,"Background Tool use in humans requires that multisensory information is integrated across different locations, from objects seen to be distant from the hand, but felt indirectly at the hand via the tool. We tested the hypothesis that using a simple tool to perceive vibrotactile stimuli results in the enhanced processing of visual stimuli presented at the distal, functional part of the tool. Such a finding would be consistent with a shift of spatial attention to the location where the tool is used. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested this hypothesis by scanning healthy human participants' brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging, while they used a simple tool to discriminate between target vibrations, accompanied by congruent or incongruent visual distractors, on the same or opposite side to the tool. The attentional hypothesis was supported: BOLD response in occipital cortex, particularly in the right hemisphere lingual gyrus, varied significantly as a function of tool position, increasing contralaterally, and decreasing ipsilaterally to the tool. Furthermore, these modulations occurred despite the fact that participants were repeatedly instructed to ignore the visual stimuli, to respond only to the vibrotactile stimuli, and to maintain visual fixation centrally. In addition, the magnitude of multisensory (visual-vibrotactile) interactions in participants' behavioural responses significantly predicted the BOLD response in occipital cortical areas that were also modulated as a function of both visual stimulus position and tool position. Conclusions/Significance These results show that using a simple tool to locate and to perceive vibrotactile stimuli is accompanied by a shift of spatial attention to the location where the functional part of the tool is used, resulting in enhanced processing of visual stimuli at that location, and decreased processing at other locations. This was most clearly observed in the right hemisphere lingual gyrus. Such modulations of visual processing may reflect the functional importance of visuospatial information during human tool use."
https://openalex.org/W2065567972,"Background It is well known progesterone can have anxiolytic-like effects in animals in a number of different behavioral testing paradigms. Although progesterone is known to influence physiology and behavior by binding to classical intracellular progestin receptors, progesterone's anxiety reducing effects have solely been attributed to its rapid non-genomic effects at the GABAA receptor. This modulation occurs following the bioconversion of progesterone to allopregnanolone. Seemingly paradoxical results from some studies suggested that the function of progesterone to reduce anxiety-like behavior may not be entirely clear; therefore, we hypothesized that progesterone might also act upon progestin receptors to regulate anxiety. Methodology/Principal Findings To test this, we examined the anxiolytic-like effects of progesterone in male rats using the elevated plus maze, a validated test of anxiety, and the light/dark chamber in the presence or absence of a progestin receptor antagonist, RU 486. Here we present evidence suggesting that the anxiolytic-like effects of progesterone in male rats can be mediated, in part, by progestin receptors, as these effects are blocked by prior treatment with a progestin receptor antagonist. Conclusion/Significance This indicates that progesterone can act upon progestin receptors to regulate anxiety-like behavior in the male rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W2098539019,"The Ca(v)beta subunits of high voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels control the trafficking and biophysical properties of the alpha(1) subunit. The Ca(v)beta-alpha(1) interaction site has been mapped by crystallographic studies. Nevertheless, how this interaction leads to channel regulation has not been determined. One hypothesis is that betas regulate channel gating by modulating movements of IS6. A key requirement for this direct-coupling model is that the linker connecting IS6 to the alpha-interaction domain (AID) be a rigid structure.The present study tests this hypothesis by altering the flexibility and orientation of this region in alpha(1)2.2, then testing for Ca(v)beta regulation using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology. Flexibility was induced by replacement of the middle six amino acids of the IS6-AID linker with glycine (PG6). This mutation abolished beta2a and beta3 subunits ability to shift the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, and the ability of beta2a to produce non-inactivating currents. Orientation of Ca(v)beta with respect to alpha(1)2.2 was altered by deletion of 1, 2, or 3 amino acids from the IS6-AID linker (Bdel1, Bdel2, Bdel3, respectively). Again, the ability of Ca(v)beta subunits to regulate these biophysical properties were totally abolished in the Bdel1 and Bdel3 mutants. Functional regulation by Ca(v)beta subunits was rescued in the Bdel2 mutant, indicating that this part of the linker forms beta-sheet. The orientation of beta with respect to alpha was confirmed by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay.These results show that the orientation of the Ca(v)beta subunit relative to the alpha(1)2.2 subunit is critical, and suggests additional points of contact between these subunits are required for Ca(v)beta to regulate channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2000683731,"Background Anthrax edema toxin (EdTx) is an adenylate cyclase which operates in the perinuclear region of host cells. However, the action of EdTx is poorly understood, especially at molecular level. The ability of EdTx to modulate cAMP-dependent signaling was studied in Jurkat T cells and was compared with that of other cAMP-rising agents: Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin, cholera toxin and forskolin. Methodology/Principal Findings EdTx caused a prolonged increase of the intracellular cAMP concentration. This led to nuclear translocation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) catalytic subunit, phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and expression of a reporter gene under control of the cAMP response element. Neither p90 ribosomal S6 kinase nor mitogen- and stress-activated kinase, which mediate CREB phosphorylation during T cell activation, were involved. The duration of phospho-CREB binding to chromatin correlated with the spatio-temporal rise of cAMP levels. Strikingly, EdTx pre-treated T cells were unresponsive to other stimuli involving CREB phosphorylation such as addition of forskolin or T cell receptor cross-linking. Conclusions/Significance We concluded that, in a first intoxication phase, EdTx induces PKA-dependent signaling, which culminates in CREB phosphorylation and activation of gene transcription. Subsequently CREB phosphorylation is impaired and therefore T cells are not able to respond to cues involving CREB. The present data functionally link the perinuclear localization of EdTx to its intoxication mechanism, indicating that this is a specific feature of its intoxication mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2090570458,"Crosses between natural populations of two species of deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus (BW), and P. polionotus (PO), produce parent-of-origin effects on growth and development. BW females mated to PO males (bwxpo) produce growth-retarded but otherwise healthy offspring. In contrast, PO females mated to BW males (POxBW) produce overgrown and severely defective offspring. The hybrid phenotypes are pronounced in the placenta and include POxBW conceptuses which lack embryonic structures. Evidence to date links variation in control of genomic imprinting with the hybrid defects, particularly in the POxBW offspring. Establishment of genomic imprinting is typically mediated by gametic DNA methylation at sites known as gDMRs. However, imprinted gene clusters vary in their regulation by gDMR sequences.Here we further assess imprinted gene expression and DNA methylation at different cluster types in order to discern patterns. These data reveal POxBW misexpression at the Kcnq1ot1 and Peg3 clusters, both of which lose ICR methylation in placental tissues. In contrast, some embryonic transcripts (Peg10, Kcnq1ot1) reactivated the silenced allele with little or no loss of DNA methylation. Hybrid brains also display different patterns of imprinting perturbations. Several cluster pairs thought to use analogous regulatory mechanisms are differentially affected in the hybrids.These data reinforce the hypothesis that placental and somatic gene regulation differs significantly, as does that between imprinted gene clusters and between species. That such epigenetic regulatory variation exists in recently diverged species suggests a role in reproductive isolation, and that this variation is likely to be adaptive."
https://openalex.org/W2105815835,"Identification of short, structured peptides able to mimic potently protein-protein interfaces remains a challenge in drug discovery. We report here the use of a naive cyclic peptide phage display library to identify peptide ligands able to recognize and mimic IgG1-Fc functions with Fc gammaRI. Selection by competing off binders to Fc gammaRI with IgG1 allowed the isolation of a family of peptides sharing the common consensus sequence TX(2)CXXthetaPXLLGCPhiXE (theta represents a hydrophobic residue, Phi is usually an acidic residue, and X is any residue) and able to inhibit IgG1 binding to Fc gammaRI. In soluble form, these peptides antagonize superoxide generation mediated by IgG1. In complexed form, they trigger phagocytosis and a superoxide burst. Unlike IgG, these peptides are strictly Fc gammaRI-specific among the Fc gammaRs. Molecular modeling studies suggest that these peptides can adopt 2 distinct and complementary conformers, each able to mimic the discontinuous interface contacts constituted by the Cgamma2-A and -B chains of Fc for Fc gammaRI. In addition, by covalent homodimerization, we engineered a synthetic bivalent 37-mer peptide that retains the ability to trigger effector functions. We demonstrate here that it is feasible to maintain IgG-Fc function within a small structured peptide. These peptides represent a new format for modulation of effector functions."
https://openalex.org/W2091186774,"The SH2-containing-5'inositol phosphatase-1 (SHIP) influences signals downstream of cytokine/chemokine receptors that play a role in megakaryocytopoiesis, including thrombopoietin, stromal-cell-derived-Factor-1/CXCL-12 and interleukin-3. We hypothesize that SHIP might control megakaryocytopoiesis through effects on proliferation of megakaryocyte progenitors (MKP) and megakaryocytes (MK).Herein, we report the megakaryocytic phenotype and MK functional assays of hematopoietic organs of two strains of SHIP deficient mice with deletion of the SHIP promoter/first exon or the inositol phosphatase domain. Both SHIP deficient strains exhibit a profound increase in MKP numbers in bone marrow (BM), spleen and blood as analyzed by flow cytometry (Lin(-)c-Kit+CD41+) and functional assays (CFU-MK). SHIP deficient MKP display increased phosphorylation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3 (STAT-3), protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Despite increased MKP content, total body number of mature MK (Lin(-)c-kit(-)CD41+) are not significantly changed as SHIP deficient BM contains reduced MK while spleen MK numbers are increased. Reduction of CXCR-4 expression in SHIP deficient MK may influence MK localization to the spleen instead of the BM. Endomitosis, process involved in MK maturation, was preserved in SHIP deficient MK. Circulating platelets and red blood cells are also reduced in SHIP deficient mice.SHIP may play an important role in regulation of essential signaling pathways that control early megakaryocytopoiesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2002230441,"Background Divergence driven by female preference can give rise to pre-mating isolation more rapidly than post-mating isolation can evolve through the accumulation of allelic incompatibilities. Moreover pre-mating isolation may be more effective at maintaining morphological differentiation between divergent populations. In the context of Australian rainforest endemic skinks that were historically subjected to refugial isolation, this study examined the following predictions: 1) that assortative female preference is associated with more recent divergence of southern C. rubrigularis (S-RED) and C. rhomboidalis (BLUE), but not with deeply divergent S-RED and northern C. rubrigularis (N-RED); and 2) that upon secondary contact, morphological differentiation is maintained between S-RED and BLUE, whereas N-RED and S-RED remain morphogically indistinguishable. Principal Findings Female preference trials found no evidence for assortative female preference between N-RED and S-RED, supporting a previous genetic hybrid zone study which inferred post-mating but no pre-mating isolation. In contrast there is evidence for assortative female preference between S-RED and BLUE, with BLUE females preferring to associate with BLUE males, but S-RED females showing no preference. Multi-locus coalescent analyses, used to estimate post-divergence gene-flow between proximally located S-RED and BLUE populations, rejected zero gene-flow from BLUE to S-RED and thus RED and BLUE have maintained morphological differentiation despite secondary contact. Morphometric analyses confirmed a lack of morphological divergence between N-RED and S-RED and established that BLUE is morphologically divergent from RED in traits other than throat colour. Conclusions/Significance Long-term isolation has been sufficient to generate post-mating isolation but no morphological divergence between N-RED and S-RED. In contrast, greater morphological differentiation is associated with evidence for assortative female preference between more recently diverged S-RED and BLUE. Combined with previous estimates of lineage-wide gene flow, these results are consistent with the suggestion that assortative female preference is more effective than post-mating isolation in maintaining morphological differentiation between divergent populations."
https://openalex.org/W1979105286,"Salmonella is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that replicates within a membrane-bound vacuole in host cells. The major lysosomal membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) are recruited to the Salmonella-containing vacuole as well as Salmonella- associated filaments (Sifs) that emerge from the vacuole. LAMP-1 is a dominant membrane marker for the vacuole and Sifs. Its colocalization with both is dependent on a major secreted bacterial virulence protein, SifA. Here, we show that SifA is required for the recruitment of LAMP-2 and can be used as a second independent marker for both the bacterial vacuolar membrane and Sifs. Further, RNAi studies revealed that in LAMP-1 depleted cells, the bacteria remain membrane bound as measured by their association with LAMP-2 protein. In contrast, LAMP-2 depletion increased the amount of LAMP-1 free bacteria. Together, the data suggests that despite its abundance, LAMP-1 is not essential, but LAMP-2 may be partially important for the Salmonella-containing vacuolar membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1996029546,"The galactokinase from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (ScGal1p) is a bifunctional protein. It is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of α-d-galactose into galactose 1-phosphate at the expense of ATP but can also function as a transcriptional inducer of the yeast <i>GAL</i> genes. For both of these activities, the protein requires two ligands; a sugar (galactose) and a nucleotide (ATP). Here we investigate the effect of these ligands on the stability and conformation of ScGal1p to determine how the ligands alter protein function. We show that nucleotide binding increases the thermal stability of ScGal1p, whereas binding of galactose alone had no effect on the stability of the protein. This nucleotide stabilization effect is also observed for the related proteins <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Gal3p and <i>Kluyveromyces lactis</i> Gal1p and suggests that nucleotide binding results in the formation of, or the unmasking of, the galactose-binding site. We also show that the increase in stability of ScGal1p does not result from a large conformational change but is instead the result of a smaller more energetically favorable stabilization event. Finally, we have used mutant versions of ScGal1p to show that the galactokinase and transcriptional induction functions of the protein are distinct and separable. Mutations resulting in constitutive induction do not function by mimicking the more stable active conformation but have highlighted a possible site of interaction between ScGal1p and ScGal80p. These data give significant insights into the mechanism of action of both a galactokinase and a transcriptional inducer."
