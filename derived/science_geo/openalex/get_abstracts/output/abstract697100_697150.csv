https://openalex.org/W4284692924,"The high-entropy concept provides extended, optimized space of a composition, resulting in unusual transport phenomena and excellent thermoelectric performance. By tuning electron and phonon localization, we enhanced the figure-of-merit value to 2.7 at 750 kelvin in germanium telluride–based high-entropy materials and realized a high experimental conversion efficiency of 13.3% at a temperature difference of 506 kelvin with the fabricated segmented module. By increasing the entropy, the increased crystal symmetry delocalized the distribution of electrons in the distorted rhombohedral structure, resulting in band convergence and improved electrical properties. By contrast, the localized phonons from the entropy-induced disorder dampened the propagation of transverse phonons, which was the origin of the increased anharmonicity and largely depressed lattice thermal conductivity. We provide a paradigm for tuning electron and phonon localization by entropy manipulation, but we have also demonstrated a route for improving the performance of high-entropy thermoelectric materials."
https://openalex.org/W4284689837,"To combat future severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and spillovers of SARS-like betacoronaviruses (sarbecoviruses) threatening global health, we designed mosaic nanoparticles that present randomly arranged sarbecovirus spike receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to elicit antibodies against epitopes that are conserved and relatively occluded rather than variable, immunodominant, and exposed. We compared immune responses elicited by mosaic-8 (SARS-CoV-2 and seven animal sarbecoviruses) and homotypic (only SARS-CoV-2) RBD nanoparticles in mice and macaques and observed stronger responses elicited by mosaic-8 to mismatched (not on nanoparticles) strains, including SARS-CoV and animal sarbecoviruses. Mosaic-8 immunization showed equivalent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicrons, and protected from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV challenges, whereas homotypic SARS-CoV-2 immunization protected only from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Epitope mapping demonstrated increased targeting of conserved epitopes after mosaic-8 immunization. Together, these results suggest that mosaic-8 RBD nanoparticles could protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants and future sarbecovirus spillovers."

TIR-NLR signaling requires the helper NLRs N requirement gene 1 (NRG1), Activated Disease Resistance 1 (ADR1), and Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 (EDS1), which forms a heterodimer with each of its paralogs Phytoalexin Deficient 4 (PAD4) and Senescence-Associated Gene 101 (SAG101). Here, we show that TIR-containing proteins catalyze the production of 2′-(5′′-phosphoribosyl)-5′-adenosine monophosphate (pRib-AMP) and diphosphate (pRib-ADP) in vitro and in planta. Biochemical and structural data demonstrate that EDS1-PAD4 is a receptor complex for pRib-AMP and pRib-ADP, which allosterically promote EDS1-PAD4 interaction with ADR1-L1 but not NRG1A. Our study identifies TIR-catalyzed pRib-AMP and pRib-ADP as a missing link in TIR signaling through EDS1-PAD4 and as likely second messengers for plant immunity."
https://openalex.org/W4284678419,"Plant pathogen–activated immune signaling by nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors with an N-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain converges on Enhanced Disease Susceptibility 1 (EDS1) and its direct partners, Phytoalexin Deficient 4 (PAD4) or Senescence-Associated Gene 101 (SAG101). TIR-encoded nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrolase (NADase) produces signaling molecules to promote exclusive EDS1-PAD4 and EDS1-SAG101 interactions with helper NLR subclasses. In this work, we show that TIR-containing proteins catalyze adenosine diphosphate (ADP)–ribosylation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and ADP ribose (ADPR) through ADPR polymerase–like and NADase activity, forming ADP-ribosylated ATP (ADPr-ATP) and ADPr-ADPR (di-ADPR), respectively. Specific binding of ADPr-ATP or di-ADPR allosterically promotes EDS1-SAG101 interaction with helper NLR N requirement gene 1A (NRG1A) in vitro and in planta. Our data reveal an enzymatic activity of TIRs that enables specific activation of the EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 immunity branch."
https://openalex.org/W4285041350,"The coronavirus spike glycoprotein attaches to host receptors and mediates viral fusion. Using a broad screening approach, we isolated seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to all human-infecting coronavirus spike proteins from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immune donors. These mAbs recognize the fusion peptide and acquire affinity and breadth through somatic mutations. Despite targeting a conserved motif, only some mAbs show broad neutralizing activity in vitro against alpha- and betacoronaviruses, including animal coronaviruses WIV-1 and PDF-2180. Two selected mAbs also neutralize Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 authentic viruses and reduce viral burden and pathology in vivo. Structural and functional analyses showed that the fusion peptide–specific mAbs bound with different modalities to a cryptic epitope hidden in prefusion stabilized spike, which became exposed upon binding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or ACE2-mimicking mAbs."
https://openalex.org/W4285385521,"The separation and purification of xylene isomers is an industrially important but challenging process. Developing highly efficient adsorbents is crucial for the implementation of simulated moving bed technology for industrial separation of these isomers. Herein, we report a stacked one-dimensional coordination polymer {[Mn(dhbq)(H 2 O) 2 ], H 2 dhbq = 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone} that exhibits an ideal molecular recognition and sieving of xylene isomers. Its distinct temperature-adsorbate–dependent adsorption behavior enables full separation of p -, m -, and o -xylene isomers in both vapor and liquid phases. The delicate stimuli-responsive swelling of the structure imparts this porous material with exceptionally high flexibility and stability, well-balanced adsorption capacity, high selectivity, and fast kinetics at conditions mimicking industrial settings. This study may offer an alternative approach for energy-efficient and adsorption-based industrial xylene separation and purification processes."
https://openalex.org/W3185324667,"Gauge theories form the foundation of modern physics, with applications ranging from elementary particle physics and early-universe cosmology to condensed matter systems. We perform quantum simulations of the unitary dynamics of a U(1) symmetric gauge field theory and demonstrate emergent irreversible behavior. The highly constrained gauge theory dynamics are encoded in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard simulator, which couples fermionic matter fields through dynamical gauge fields. We investigated global quantum quenches and the equilibration to a steady state well approximated by a thermal ensemble. Our work may enable the investigation of elusive phenomena, such as Schwinger pair production and string breaking, and paves the way for simulating more complex, higher-dimensional gauge theories on quantum synthetic matter devices."
https://openalex.org/W4285493817,"Hematopoietic mosaic loss of Y chromosome (mLOY) is associated with increased risk of mortality and age-related diseases in men, but the causal and mechanistic relationships have yet to be established. Here, we show that male mice reconstituted with bone marrow cells lacking the Y chromosome display increased mortality and age-related profibrotic pathologies including reduced cardiac function. Cardiac macrophages lacking the Y chromosome exhibited polarization toward a more fibrotic phenotype, and treatment with a transforming growth factor β1-neutralizing antibody ameliorated cardiac dysfunction in mLOY mice. A prospective study revealed that mLOY in blood is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and heart failure-associated mortality. Together, these results indicate that hematopoietic mLOY causally contributes to fibrosis, cardiac dysfunction, and mortality in men."
https://openalex.org/W4285491288,"Human NLRP1 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 1) is an innate immune sensor predominantly expressed in the skin and airway epithelium. Here, we report that human NLRP1 senses the ultraviolet B (UVB)- and toxin-induced ribotoxic stress response (RSR). Biochemically, RSR leads to the direct hyperphosphorylation of a human-specific disordered linker region of NLRP1 (NLRP1 DR ) by MAP3K20/ZAKα kinase and its downstream effector, p38. Mutating a single ZAKα phosphorylation site in NLRP1 DR abrogates UVB- and ribotoxin-driven pyroptosis in human keratinocytes. Moreover, fusing NLRP1 DR to CARD8, which is insensitive to RSR by itself, creates a minimal inflammasome sensor for UVB and ribotoxins. These results provide insight into UVB sensing by human skin keratinocytes, identify several ribotoxins as NLRP1 agonists, and establish inflammasome-driven pyroptosis as an integral component of the RSR."
https://openalex.org/W4284712558,"Dielectric elastomers (DEs) can act as deformable capacitors that generate mechanical work in response to an electric field. DEs are often based on commercial acrylic and silicone elastomers. Acrylics require prestretching to achieve high actuation strains and lack processing flexibility. Silicones allow for processability and rapid response but produce much lower strains. In this work, a processable, high-performance dielectric elastomer (PHDE) with a bimodal network structure is synthesized, and its electromechanical properties are tailored by adjusting cross-linkers and hydrogen bonding within the elastomer network. The PHDE exhibits a maximum areal strain of 190% and maintains strains higher than 110% at 2 hertz without prestretching. A dry stacking process with high efficiency, scalability, and yield enables multilayer actuators that maintain the high actuation performance of single-layer films."
https://openalex.org/W4284694916,"Maximizing the utilization of noble metals is crucial for applications such as catalysis. We found that the minimum loading of platinum for optimal performance in the hydroconversion of n -alkanes for industrially relevant bifunctional catalysts could be reduced by a factor of 10 or more through the rational arranging of functional sites at the nanoscale. Intentionally depositing traces of platinum nanoparticles on the alumina binder or the outer surface of zeolite crystals, instead of inside the zeolite crystals, enhanced isomer selectivity without compromising activity. Separation between platinum and zeolite acid sites preserved the metal and acid functions by limiting micropore blockage by metal clusters and enhancing access to metal sites. Reduced platinum nanoparticles were more active than platinum single atoms strongly bonded to the alumina binder."
https://openalex.org/W4284703829,"Helical alignments within the heart’s musculature have been speculated to be important in achieving physiological pumping efficiencies. Testing this possibility is difficult, however, because it is challenging to reproduce the fine spatial features and complex structures of the heart’s musculature using current techniques. Here we report focused rotary jet spinning (FRJS), an additive manufacturing approach that enables rapid fabrication of micro/nanofiber scaffolds with programmable alignments in three-dimensional geometries. Seeding these scaffolds with cardiomyocytes enabled the biofabrication of tissue-engineered ventricles, with helically aligned models displaying more uniform deformations, greater apical shortening, and increased ejection fractions compared with circumferential alignments. The ability of FRJS to control fiber arrangements in three dimensions offers a streamlined approach to fabricating tissues and organs, with this work demonstrating how helical architectures contribute to cardiac performance."
https://openalex.org/W4285385773,"γδ T cells represent a substantial fraction of intestinal lymphocytes at homeostasis, but they also constitute a major lymphocyte population infiltrating colorectal cancers (CRCs); however, their temporal contribution to CRC development or progression remains unclear. Using human CRC samples and murine CRC models, we found that most γδ T cells in premalignant or nontumor colons exhibit cytotoxic markers, whereas tumor-infiltrating γδ T cells express a protumorigenic profile. These contrasting T cell profiles were associated with distinct T cell receptor (TCR)–Vγδ gene usage in both humans and mice. Longitudinal intersectional genetics and antibody-dependent strategies targeting murine γδ T cells enriched in the epithelium at steady state led to heightened tumor development, whereas targeting γδ subsets that accumulate during CRC resulted in reduced tumor growth. Our results uncover temporal pro- and antitumor roles for γδ T cell subsets."
https://openalex.org/W4285385686,"The nature of hydrated proton on solid surfaces is of vital importance in electrochemistry, proton channels, and hydrogen fuel cells but remains unclear because of the lack of atomic-scale characterization. We directly visualized Eigen- and Zundel-type hydrated protons within the hydrogen bonding water network on Au(111) and Pt(111) surfaces, using cryogenic qPlus-based atomic force microscopy under ultrahigh vacuum. We found that the Eigen cations self-assembled into monolayer structures with local order, and the Zundel cations formed long-range ordered structures stabilized by nuclear quantum effects. Two Eigen cations could combine into one Zundel cation accompanied with a simultaneous proton transfer to the surface. Moreover, we revealed that the Zundel configuration was preferred over the Eigen on Pt(111), and such a preference was absent on Au(111)."
https://openalex.org/W4284699865,"Carbonaceous asteroids, such as (101955) Bennu, preserve material from the early Solar System, including volatile compounds and organic molecules. We report spacecraft imaging and spectral data collected during and after retrieval of a sample from Bennu’s surface. The sampling event mobilized rocks and dust into a debris plume, excavating a 9-meter-long elliptical crater. This exposed material is darker, spectrally redder, and more abundant in fine particulates than the original surface. The bulk density of the displaced subsurface material was 500 to 700 kilograms per cubic meter, which is about half that of the whole asteroid. Particulates that landed on instrument optics spectrally resemble aqueously altered carbonaceous meteorites. The spacecraft stored 250 ± 101 grams of material, which will be delivered to Earth in 2023."
https://openalex.org/W4284667933,"Sound-including music and noise-can relieve pain in humans, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unknown. We discovered that analgesic effects of sound depended on a low (5-decibel) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to ambient noise in mice. Viral tracing, microendoscopic calcium imaging, and multitetrode recordings in freely moving mice showed that low-SNR sounds inhibited glutamatergic inputs from the auditory cortex (ACxGlu) to the thalamic posterior (PO) and ventral posterior (VP) nuclei. Optogenetic or chemogenetic inhibition of the ACxGlu→PO and ACxGlu→VP circuits mimicked the low-SNR sound-induced analgesia in inflamed hindpaws and forepaws, respectively. Artificial activation of these two circuits abolished the sound-induced analgesia. Our study reveals the corticothalamic circuits underlying sound-promoted analgesia by deciphering the role of the auditory system in pain processing."
https://openalex.org/W4284671198,"Fascinating properties are displayed by synthetic multicomponent supramolecular systems that comprise a manifold of competitive interactions, thereby mimicking natural processes. We present the integration of two reentrant phase transitions based on an unexpected dilution-induced assembly process using supramolecular polymers and surfactants. The co-assembly of the water-soluble benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA-EG 4 ) and a surfactant at a specific ratio yielded small-sized aggregates. These interactions were modeled using the competition between self-sorting and co-assembly of both components. The small-sized aggregates were transformed into supramolecular polymer networks by a twofold dilution in water without changing their ratio. Kinetic experiments show the in situ growth of micrometer-long fibers in the dilution process. We were able to create systems that undergo fully reversible hydrogel-solution-hydrogel-solution transitions upon dilution by introducing another orthogonal interaction."
https://openalex.org/W4285385758,"Controlling selectivity of reactions is an ongoing quest in chemistry. In this work, we demonstrate reversible and selective bond formation and dissociation promoted by tip-induced reduction-oxidation reactions on a surface. Molecular rearrangements leading to different constitutional isomers are selected by the polarity and magnitude of applied voltage pulses from the tip of a combined scanning tunneling and atomic force microscope. Characterization of voltage dependence of the reactions and determination of reaction rates demonstrate selectivity in constitutional isomerization reactions and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms. With support of density functional theory calculations, we find that the energy landscape of the isomers in different charge states is important to rationalize the selectivity. Tip-induced selective single-molecule reactions increase our understanding of redox chemistry and could lead to novel molecular machines."
https://openalex.org/W4284672872,"Despite huge potential, automation of synthetic chemistry has only made incremental progress over the past few decades. We present an automatically executable chemical reaction database of 100 molecules representative of the range of reactions found in contemporary organic synthesis. These reactions include transition metal-catalyzed coupling reactions, heterocycle formations, functional group interconversions, and multicomponent reactions. The chemical reaction codes or χDLs for the reactions have been stored in a database for version control, validation, collaboration, and data mining. Of these syntheses, more than 50 entries from the database have been downloaded and robotically run in seven modular chemputers with yields and purities comparable to those achieved by an expert chemist. We also demonstrate the automatic purification of a range of compounds using a chromatography module seamlessly coupled to the platform and programmed with the same language."
https://openalex.org/W4286005666,"The public is convinced that beliefs in conspiracy theories are increasing, and many scholars, journalists, and policymakers agree. Given the associations between conspiracy theories and many non-normative tendencies, lawmakers have called for policies to address these increases. However, little evidence has been provided to demonstrate that beliefs in conspiracy theories have, in fact, increased over time. We address this evidentiary gap. Study 1 investigates change in the proportion of Americans believing 46 conspiracy theories; our observations in some instances span half a century. Study 2 examines change in the proportion of individuals across six European countries believing six conspiracy theories. Study 3 traces beliefs about which groups are conspiring against ""us,"" while Study 4 tracks generalized conspiracy thinking in the U.S. from 2012 to 2021. In no instance do we observe systematic evidence for an increase in conspiracism, however operationalized. We discuss the theoretical and policy implications of our findings."

https://openalex.org/W4285491664,"Effective communication across brain areas requires distributed neuronal networks to dynamically synchronize or decouple their ongoing activity. GABA ergic interneurons lock ensembles to network oscillations, but there remain questions regarding how synchrony is actively disengaged to allow for new communication partners. We recorded the activity of identified interneurons in the CA1 hippocampus of awake mice. Neurogliaform cells (NGFCs)—which provide GABA ergic inhibition to distal dendrites of pyramidal cells—strongly coupled their firing to those gamma oscillations synchronizing local networks with cortical inputs. Rather than strengthening such synchrony, action potentials of NGFCs decoupled pyramidal cell activity from cortical gamma oscillations but did not reduce their firing nor affect local oscillations. Thus, NGFCs regulate information transfer by temporarily disengaging the synchrony without decreasing the activity of communicating networks."

https://openalex.org/W4284673344,"Pharyngeal arches are a key innovation that likely contributed to the evolution of the jaws and braincase of vertebrates. It has long been hypothesized that the pharyngeal (branchial) arch evolved from an unjointed cartilaginous rod in vertebrate ancestors such as that in the nonvertebrate chordate amphioxus, but whether such ancestral anatomy existed remains unknown. The pharyngeal skeleton of controversial Cambrian animals called yunnanozoans may contain the oldest fossil evidence constraining the early evolution of the arches, yet its correlation with that of vertebrates is still disputed. By examining additional specimens in previously unexplored techniques (for example, x-ray microtomography, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectrometry element mapping), we found evidence that yunnanozoan branchial arches consist of cellular cartilage with an extracellular matrix dominated by microfibrils, a feature hitherto considered specific to vertebrates. Our phylogenetic analysis provides further support that yunnanozoans are stem vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W4284677688,"Two models describe solvent transport through swollen, nonporous membranes. The pore-flow model, based on fluid mechanics, works for porous membranes, whereas the solution-diffusion model invokes molecular diffusion to treat nonporous membranes. Both approaches make valid arguments for swollen polymer membranes, but they disagree in their predictions of intramembrane pressure and concentration profiles. Using a fluid-solid model that treats the solvent and membrane matrix as separate phases, we show both classical models to be valid, to represent complementary approaches to the same phenomenon, and to make identical predictions. The fluid-solid model clarifies recent reverse osmosis measurements; provides a predictive and mechanistic basis for empirical high-pressure limiting flux phenomena, in quantitative agreement with classic measurements; and gives a framework to treat nonporous but mechanically heterogeneous membrane materials."
https://openalex.org/W4286005726,"A common phenomenon associated with alluvial rivers is their meander evolution, eventually forming cutoffs. Point bar deposits and ox-bow lakes are the products of lateral bend migration and meander cutoff. The present study focuses on identifying the meanders of River Manu and their cutoffs. Moreover, this study compares the temporal evolution and predicts the progress of selected meanders of River Manu. In the present research, the Survey of India topographical map, satellite imagery, and geographic information system (GIS) technique were used to examine the evolution of the Manu River meander. Subsequently, a field visit was done to the selected cutoffs and meanders of River Manu to ascertain the present status and collect data. It has been observed that many cutoffs have undergone temporal changes, and their sizes have decreased. Some have become dried or converted to agricultural fields. The width of River Manu has decreased in all the selected bends from 1932 to 2017. The sinuosity index has changed from 2.04 (1932) to 1.90 (2017), and the length of the river has decreased by 7 km in 85 years (1932-2017). The decrease in length is evident from lowering the number of meanders. Uniformity coefficient and coefficient of curvature of the bank soil samples were calculated, indicating that the soil is poorly graded and falls under the cohesionless category. Based on cross-section analysis, sediment discharge, grain-size analysis of the bank material, channel planform change, and radius of curvature, it can be stated that almost all the selected bends have the probability of future cutoff. The highest probabilities were observed in bend 3 (Jalai) and bend 4 (Chhontail). This work is aimed to provide planners with decisions regarding the construction of roads and bridges in areas that show the huge dynamicity of river meandering."
https://openalex.org/W4284665849,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) recruit β-arrestins to coordinate diverse cellular processes, but the structural dynamics driving this process are poorly understood. Atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) are intrinsically biased GPCRs that engage β-arrestins but not G proteins, making them a model system for investigating the structural basis of β-arrestin recruitment. Here, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on 13CH3-ε-methionine-labeled ACKR3, revealing that β-arrestin recruitment is associated with conformational exchange at key regions of the extracellular ligand-binding pocket and intracellular β-arrestin-coupling region. NMR studies of ACKR3 mutants defective in β-arrestin recruitment identified an allosteric hub in the receptor core that coordinates transitions among heterogeneously populated and selected conformational states. Our data suggest that conformational selection guides β-arrestin recruitment by tuning receptor dynamics at intracellular and extracellular regions."

https://openalex.org/W4284707421,"Gender-targeted police reforms are frequently proposed to tackle the global problem of rising yet under-reported gender-based violence (GBV)-but with mixed and often disappointing results. We explore this issue in India, a country with alarming rates of GBV and limited police capacity, by studying the impact of Women's Help Desks (WHDs): dedicated spaces for women in local police stations, staffed by trained officers. Drawing on the largest randomized controlled trial of a police reform to date (180 police stations serving 23.4 million people), we find that officers in stations with WHDs are more likely to register cases of GBV, particularly where female officers run the desks. This suggests that even in resource-constrained and patriarchal environments, police responsiveness can be improved by focusing and mainstreaming attention to women's cases and by greater gender representation within the police."
https://openalex.org/W4286007753,"In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by global spread of several lineages with evidence for increased transmissibility. Throughout the pandemic, Russia has remained among the countries with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, making it a potential hotspot for emergence of novel variants. Here, we show that among the globally significant variants of concern that have spread globally by late 2020, alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351) or gamma (P.1), none have been sampled in Russia before the end of 2020. Instead, between summer 2020 and spring 2021, the epidemic in Russia has been characterized by the spread of two lineages that were rare in most other countries: B.1.1.317 and a sublineage of B.1.1 including B.1.1.397 (hereafter, B.1.1.397+). Their frequency has increased concordantly in different parts of Russia. On top of these lineages, in late December 2020, alpha (B.1.1.7) emerged in Russia, reaching a frequency of 17.4% (95% C.I.: 12.0%-24.4%) in March 2021. Additionally, we identify three novel distinct lineages, AT.1, B.1.1.524 and B.1.1.525, that have started to spread, together reaching the frequency of 11.8% (95% C.I.: 7.5%-18.1%) in March 2021. These lineages carry combinations of several notable mutations, including the S:E484K mutation of concern, deletions at a recurrent deletion region of the spike glycoprotein (S:Δ140–142, S:Δ144 or S:Δ136–144), and nsp6:Δ106–108 (also known as ORF1a:Δ3675–3677). Community-based PCR testing indicates that these variants have continued to spread in April 2021, with the frequency of B.1.1.7 reaching 21.7% (95% C.I.: 12.3%-35.6%), and the joint frequency of B.1.1.524 and B.1.1.525, 15.2% (95% C.I.: 7.6%-28.2%). Although these variants have been displaced by the onset of delta variant in May-June 2021, lineages B.1.1.317, B.1.1.397+, AT.1, B.1.1.524 and B.1.1.525 and the combinations of mutations comprising them that are found in other lineages merit monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W4286209123,"The socio-demographic profile of pregnant women in low- and middle- income countries is characterized by low educational attainment and unemployment, leading to social and economic morbidity. characterized by limited opportunities for education, employment, and marriage, which are strongly related to the stigmatization of the disease. The study of the socio- profile and obstetric outcomes of pregnant women with epilepsy in Alagoas, Brazil, may help understand this scenario and facilitate the development of public policy strategies to reduce local morbidity.We aimed to describe the sociodemographic profile of pregnant women with epilepsy and obstetric outcomes in Alagoas, Brazil.This cohort study was based on medical records of pregnant women with epilepsy in Brazilian high-risk maternity hospitals from 2008 to 2020. The following data were collected: age, race, education, marital status, occupation, number of pregnancies, delivery, and abortion. The inclusion criteria were pregnant women with and without epilepsy (control group) aged < 40 years.The prevalence of PWWE was 0.49% (n = 224/44,917). Cesarean delivery was more frequent in PWWE than in pregnant women without epilepsy (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 22.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 14.35-33.73; p<0,01). Abortion was associated with PWWE (OR adjusted = 1.72; 95% CI = 1.13-2.61; p = 0.01). Pregnant women in the countryside were more likely to develop epilepsy than those born in the capital (OR = 1.55; 95% CI = 1.12-2.14; p <0.01).The PWWE socio-demographic profile of the Alagoas had a predominance of brown- colored skin, single status, homemakers, and illiteracy with a high proportion residing in the interior of the state.

https://openalex.org/W4286210794,"The Covid-19 pandemic has emerged as the leading public health challenge of our time (20th century). While vaccinations have finally blunted the death rate, concern has remained about more virulent forms highlighting the need for alternative approaches. Epidemiological studies indicate that physical activity has been shown to decrease the risk of infection of some respiratory viruses. Part of the salutary effects of exercise is believed to be through the elaboration of cytokines by contracting skeletal muscles (termed myokines). The objective of this study was to investigate whether exercise-induced myokines would mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of the bronchial epithelium through modulating the SARS-CoV-2 Covid-19 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 -ACE2) its priming enzyme, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2).We utilized a cell culture model of exercise to generate myokines by differentiating C2C12 cells into myotubules and inducing them to contract via low-frequency electric pulse stimulation. Condition media was concentrated via centrifugation and applied to human immortalized human bronchial epithelium cell line (6HBE14o) along with conditioned media from unstimulated myotubules as controls. Following exposure to myokines, the 16HBE14o cells were harvested and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for assessment of mRNA and protein levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively. Pilot proteomic data was performed with isotope barcoding and mass spectroscopy.Quantitative Real-Time PCR of 16HBE14o with 48 h treated unstimulated vs. stimulated myokine treatment revealed a reduction of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA by 32% (p<2.69x10-5) and 41% (p<4.57x10-5), respectively. The high sensitivity of ELISAs showed downregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression in 16HBE14o cells by 53% (p<0.01) and 32% (p<0.03) respectively with 48 h treated. For rigor, this work was replicated in the human lung cancer cell line A549, which mirrored the downregulation. Proteomic analysis showed dramatic alteration in myokine profile between contracted and uncontracted C2C12 tubules.The current study explores a novel approach of a modified exercise cell culture system and uses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as a surrogate marker of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. In conclusion, we demonstrated biological data supporting exercise's protective effect against Covid-19. These further strengthen myokines' beneficial role as potential therapeutic targets against SARS-CoV-2 and similar viruses albeit these preliminary cell culture studies will require future validation in animal models."
https://openalex.org/W4286008021,"Recent increases in the burn area and severity of wildfires in the western US have raised concerns about the impact on stream water temperature-a key determinant of cold-water fish habitats. However, the effect on seasonal water temperatures of concern, including winter and summer, are not fully understood. In this study, we assessed the impact of wildfire burns at Boulder Creek (Oregon), Elk Creek (Oregon), and Gibbon River (Wyoming) watersheds on the downstream winter and summer water temperatures for the first three post-fire years. To obtain results independent of the choice of the analytical method, we evaluated the consequence of each burn using three different statistical approaches that utilize local water temperature data. Our results from the three approaches indicated that the response of water temperatures to wildfire burns varied across seasons and sites. Wildfire burns were associated with a median increase of up to 0.56°C (Standard Error; S.E. < 0.23°C) in the summer mean water temperatures (MWT) and 62 degree-day Celsius (DDC; S.E. < 20.7 DDC) in the summer accumulated degree days (ADD) for the three subsequent years across studied stream sites. Interestingly, these burns also corresponded to a median decrease of up to 0.49°C (S.E. < 0.45°C) in the winter MWT and 39 DDC (S.E. < 40.5 DDC) in the winter ADD for the same period across sites. Wildfire effects on the downstream water temperatures diminished with increasing site distance from the burn perimeter. Our analyses demonstrated that analytical methods that utilize local watershed data could be applied to evaluate fire effects on downstream water temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W4286007889,"SfM/MVS photogrammetry has received increasing attention due to its convenience, broadening the range of its applications into archaeology and anthropology. Because the accuracy of SfM/MVS depends on photography, one important issue is that incorrect or low-density point clouds are found in 3D models due to poor overlapping between images. A systematic way of taking photographs solve these problems, though it has not been well established and the accuracy has not been examined either, with some exceptions. The present study aims to (i) develop an efficient method for recording pottery using an automated turntable and (ii) assess its accuracy through a comparison with 3D models made by laser scanning. We recorded relatively simple pottery manufactured by prehistoric farmers in the Japanese archipelago using SfM/MVS photogrammetry and laser scanning. Further, by measuring the Hausdorff distance between 3D models made using these two methods, we show that their difference is negligibly small, suggesting that our method is sufficiently accurate to record pottery."

https://openalex.org/W4286005668,"Continental margins host methane seeps, animal falls and wood falls, with chemosynthetic communities that may share or exchange species. The goal of this study was to examine the existence and nature of linkages among chemosynthesis-based ecosystems by deploying organic fall mimics (bone and wood) alongside defaunated carbonate rocks within high and lesser levels of seepage activity for 7.4 years. We compared community composition, density, and trophic structure of invertebrates on these hard substrates at active methane seepage and transition (less seepage) sites at Mound 12 at ~1,000 m depth, a methane seep off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. At transition sites, the community composition on wood and bone was characteristic of natural wood- and whale-fall community composition, which rely on decay of the organic substrates. However, at active sites, seepage activity modified the relationship between fauna and substrate, seepage activity had a stronger effect in defining and homogenizing these communities and they depend less on organic decay. In contrast to community structure, macrofaunal trophic niche overlap between substrates, based on standard ellipse areas, was greater at transition sites than at active sites, except between rock and wood. Our observations suggest that whale- and wood-fall substrates can function as stepping stones for seep fauna even at later successional stages, providing hard substrate for attachment and chemosynthetic food."

In this study, GBS approach was used to reveal a new structuration of genetic diversity and population structure of pigeonpea in Benin. We used a total of 688 high-quality Single Nucleotide Polymorphism markers for a total of 44 pigeonpea genotypes. The distribution of SNP markers on the 11 chromosomes ranged from 14 on chromosome 5 to 133 on chromosome 2. The Polymorphism Information Content and gene diversity values were 0.30 and 0.34 respectively. The analysis of population structure revealed four clear subpopulations. The Weighted Neighbor Joining tree agreed with structure analyses by grouping the 44 genotypes into four clusters. The PCoA revealed that genotypes from subpopulations 1, 2 and 3 intermixed among themselves. The Analysis of Molecular Variance showed 7% of the total variation among genotypes while the rest of variation (93%) was within genotypes from subpopulations indicating a high gene exchange (Nm = 7.13) and low genetic differentiation (PhiPT = 0.07) between subpopulations. Subpopulation 2 presented the highest mean values of number of different alleles (Na = 1.57), number of loci with private alleles (Pa = 0.11) and the percentage of polymorphic loci (P = 57.12%). We discuss our findings and demonstrate how the genetic diversity and the population structure of this specie can be used through the Genome Wide Association Studies and Marker-Assisted Selection to enhance genetic gain in pigeonpea breeding programs in Benin."
https://openalex.org/W4286008014,"Policies to reduce greenhouse gases associated with electricity generation have been a major focus of public policy in the United States, but their implications for achieving environmental justice among historically overburdened communities inappropriately remains a marginal issue. In this study we address research gaps in historical and current ambient air emissions burdens in environmental justice communities from power plants participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gases Initiative (RGGI), the country's first market-based power sector emissions reduction program. We find that in RGGI states the percentage of people of color that live within 0-6.2 miles from power plants is up to 23.5 percent higher than the percent of the white population that lives within those same distance bands, and the percentage of people living in poverty that live within 0-5 miles from power plants is up to 15.3 percent higher than the percent of the population not living in poverty within those same distance bands. More importantly, the transition from coal to natural gas underway before RGGI formally started resulted in large increases in both the number of electric-generating units burning natural gas and total net generation from natural gas in environmental justice communities hosting electric-generating units, compared to other communities. Our findings indicate that power sector carbon mitigation policies' focusing on aggregate emissions reductions have largely benefitted non-environmental justice communities and have not redressed the fundamental problem of disparities in pollutant burdens between EJ and non-EJ communities. These must be directly addressed in climate change and carbon emissions mitigation policy."

https://openalex.org/W4286005463,"The rise of ideological polarization in the U.S. over the past few decades has come with an increase in hostility on both sides of the political aisle. Although communication and compromise are hallmarks of a functioning society, research has shown that people overestimate the negative affect they will experience when viewing oppositional media, and it is likely that negative forecasts lead many to avoid cross-ideological communication (CIC) altogether. Additionally, a growing ideological geographic divide and online extremism fueled by social media audiences make engaging in CIC more difficult than ever. Here, we demonstrate that online video-chat platforms (i.e., Zoom) can be used to promote effective CIC among ideologically polarized individuals, as well as to better study CIC in a controlled setting. Participants ( n = 122) had a face-to-face CIC over Zoom, either privately or publicly with a silent ingroup audience present. Participant forecasts about the interaction were largely inaccurate, with the actual conversation experience found to be more positive than anticipated. Additionally, the presence of an ingroup audience was associated with increased conflict. In both conditions, participants showed preliminary signs of attitude moderation, felt more favorable toward the outgroup, and felt more informed about the issue after the CIC. These results suggest that face-to-face CIC’s are generally positive and beneficial for polarized individuals, and that greater effects may be achieved through private conversations, as opposed to more public social media-like interactions. Future researchers studying ideological conflict may find success using similar Zoom paradigms to bring together ideologically diverse individuals in controlled lab settings."
https://openalex.org/W4286005817,"Tick-borne diseases are among the challenges associated with warming climate. Many studies predict, and already note, expansion of ticks' habitats to the north, bringing previously non-endemic diseases, such as borreliosis and encephalitis, to the new areas. In addition, higher temperatures accelerate phases of ticks' development in areas where ticks have established populations. Earlier works have shown that meteorological parameters, such as temperature and humidity influence ticks' survival and define their areas of habitat. Here, we study the link between climatic parameters and tick-related hospital visits as well as borreliosis incidence rates focusing on European Russia. We have used yearly incidence rates of borreliosis spanning a period of 20 years (1997-2016) and weekly tick-related hospital visits spanning two years (2018-2019). We identify regions in Russia characterized by similar dynamics of incidence rates and dominating tick species. For each cluster, we find a set of climatic parameters that are significantly correlated with the incidence rates, though a linear regression approach using exclusively climatic parameters to incidence prediction was less than 50% effective. On a weekly timescale, we find correlations of different climatic parameters with hospital visits. Finally, we trained two long short-term memory neural network models to project the tick-related hospital visits until the end of the century, under the RCP8.5 climate scenario, and present our findings in the evolution of the tick season length for different regions in Russia. Our results show that the regions with an expected increase in both tick season length and borreliosis incidence rates are located in the southern forested areas of European Russia. Oppositely, our projections suggest no prolongation of the tick season length in the northern areas with already established tick population."
https://openalex.org/W4286209014,"Previous work has often disregarded the psychological heterogeneity of violent extremists. This research aimed to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the psychological diversity of violent extremists. Based on qualitative work, we developed and validated the Extremist Archetypes Scale, identifying five distinct archetype dimensions: “adventurer,” “fellow traveler,” “leader,” “drifter” and “misfit.” Study 1 identified five dimensions among White majority members ( N = 307), four of which were related to extremist violent intentions and which dissociated in terms of sociopolitical ideologies and intergroup attitudes. Preregistered Study 2 ( N = 308) confirmed the scale’s five-factor solution in another sample of White majority members, replicated relationships with violent intentions, and demonstrated the dimensions’ distinct personality correlates. As in Study 1, the archetype dimensions had positive associations with extremist violent intentions and tapped onto different psychological profiles in terms of major personality traits. Study 3 ( N = 317) replicated these results in a sample of Muslim minority members. Measurement equivalence was established across gender, age, political orientation, and ethnicity (majority and minority)."
https://openalex.org/W4286209644,"Background Knowledge of and compliance to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines are crucial to curbing hospital acquired infections (HAIs). Globally, about 7–10% of patients suffer HAIs. However, there is limited evidence on nurses’ knowledge and adherence to IPC guidelines. Therefore, this study assessed the knowledge and determinants of IPC compliance among nurses in Yendi Municipality, Northern Ghana. Methods We conducted a quantitative cross-sectional study among 209 nurses of the Yendi Municipal hospital, using an adapted questionnaire. We collected and analysed data using SPSS version 26. Socio-demographics, knowledge level and compliance to IPC guidelines were assessed using descriptive statistics. The minimum scores for knowledge and compliance were 0 each with maximum scores being 10 and 8 respectively. Using binary multivariate logistic regression, the determinants of IPC compliance were analysed and odds ratios reported at 95% confidence intervals. Results The nurses had high mean and standard deviation scores for knowledge (7.26 ± 1.4) and compliance to IPC guidelines (5.41 ± 1.5). Females (aOR: 0.33; 95%CI: 0.17–0.64; p = 0.001) were significantly less likely to comply to IPC guidelines. Nurses working in Maternity/Labour wards (aOR: 8.31; 95%CI: 2.46–28.15; p = 0.001) and Outpatient Department (OPD)/Psychiatry (aOR: 5.00; 95%CI: 1.42–17.62; p = 0.012) were associated with higher odds of complying to IPC guidelines. Availability of IPC guidelines (aOR: 3.48; 95%CI: 1.13–10.72; p = 0.030) in a working department influenced compliance to IPC measures. Conclusion The study revealed high knowledge and high compliance regarding IPC among nurses in the Yendi Municipal Hospital. A person’s working department and the availability of IPC guidelines were key determinants for high compliance to IPC measures. However, knowledge of IPC did not influence compliance to IPC guidelines. The Municipal and Regional Health directorates, should therefore ensure adequate logistic flow, provision of IPC guidelines and proper supervision to ensure maximum compliance with IPC guidelines, particularly among paediatric, medical and surgical wards nurses as well as degree holding nurses."
